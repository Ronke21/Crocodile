<text>Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield (5 September 1664 – 17 February 1718), formerly Lady Charlotte Fitzroy, was the illegitimate daughter of King Charles II of England by one of his best known mistresses, Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. Known for her beauty, Charlotte was married at age 12 to her husband, Edward Henry Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield, with whom she had a large family.

==Early life==
Charlotte Lee was born Charlotte Fitzroy, on 5 September 1664, the fourth child and second daughter of Barbara Palmer, Countess of Castlemaine, the only child of the Royalist commander William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison.

She was placed in the care of a governess; in Berkshire House. Also living there was her siblings as well as older brother Charles betrothed Mary Wood ; daughter of Sir Henry Wood and whom Charlotte&#x27;s mother had more or less abducted and had decided to bring up with her own children.
Charlotte Fitzroy&#x27;s mother had separated from her husband Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine, but was still married to him. Castlemaine did not father any of his wife&#x27;s children; Charlotte and her siblings were the illegitimate offspring of their mother&#x27;s royal lover, Charles II. The king acknowledged his daughter and so she bore the surname of Fitzroy – &quot;child of the King&quot;.

The diarist Samuel Pepys noted that the child would likely have good marriage prospects: &quot;my Lady Castlemayne [Barbara Villiers] will in merriment say that her daughter (not above a year old or two) will be the first mayde in the Court that will be married…&quot;

Charlotte was for her royal blood and connections seen as a great match and in 1672, Sir Francis Radclyffe; an ambitious man tried to bring about a marriage between the eight-year-old Charlotte and his nineteen-year-old son Edward Radclyffe. He approached and gained a meeting with Lord Grandison (the great-uncle of Charlotte) and Lord Clifford (councillor to Charles II). But for whatever reason, nothing came of the marriage and Edward would instead come to be married to Charlotte&#x27;s half-sister Mary Tudor, the daughter of Moll Davis.

In 1673, Charlotte and her older sister Anne were given coat of arms and made Lady Companions of the Order of the Garter. They were also accorded the dignities accorded to the daughters of a duke.

Since Charlotte&#x27;s mother was being displaced in the favors of the king by his new mistress Louise de Keroualle and her mother displeased, had threatened to go abroad. So in March 1676, Charlotte accompanied her mother and three of her siblings to France. Charlotte and her younger sister Barbara were sent to be educated at the convent of the Conceptionist Order of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady, at Faubourg Saint-Antoine in Paris. It is interesting to note that three nieces of Charlottes mothers estranged husband the earl of Castlemaine were also living there at the same time.

After Charlotte&#x27;s father demanded to see his daughter, and Charlotte returned to England in 1677 for the formalization of her marriage. Her mother, the Duchess of Castlemaine remained in Paris until 1684.

Charlotte was the favourite niece of James, Duke of York, younger brother of Charles II, who would later reign as King James II. The historian John Heneage Jesse wrote of Charlotte Fitzroy: &quot;we know but little of her except that she was beautiful.&quot; As a child, Charlotte was painted by the court painter Sir Peter Lely, Charles II&#x27;s Principal Painter in Ordinary, in which she is seated with her Indian page, holding a bunch of grapes and dressed in pink silk. Today, the painting hangs in the York Art Gallery.

The art historian Anna Brownell Jameson described Charlotte Fitzroy as having &quot;rivaled her mother in beauty, but was far unlike her in every other respect.&quot;Villiers was said to be a &quot;cruel and austere&quot; parent would often use her children for emotional blackmail against the king at one time threatening &quot;to bring all of his (Charles) bastards to his closet - door&quot; (i.e., abandoning them)

Another evidence for her being a very harsh mother is when Charlotte accidentally broke the glass window of her mother&#x27;s coach when traveling through the park; she was so distraught that she started crying in fear of her punishment.(being beaten) A witness to the accident sent a message to her father and he swiftly sent a message to Villiers that their daughter was not to be punished.

It appears that Charles II was a loving father. In 1682 he wrote to Charlotte: &quot;I must tell you I am glad to hear you are with child, and I hope to see you here before it be long, that I may have the satisfaction myself of telling you how much I love you, and how truly I am your kind father, Charles Rex&quot;.

Charles also funded a townhouse to be built by Sir Christopher Wren in 1677 named Lichfield House, it was adjoined by another home which is today known as 10 Downing Street.)

While Charlotte was not directly involved in politics, on account of her being kin to royalty she was seen as a conduit to make things known to her relatives. Such as when her paternal uncle the Duke and Duchess of York were traveling through England and were respectfully greeted by authorities and local nobility. One of the exceptions being;

==Marriage and children==
Charlotte&#x27;s mother Barbara was a second cousin (Barbaras great-uncle Sir John St John was Annes father) The politically savvy Anne St. John, Countess of Rochester was mother of the influential courtier John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester.

Through their efforts a betrothal between Charlotte and her second cousin once removed,Sir Edward Henry Lee was made and then officially contracted May 1674, before her tenth birthday, The young couple underwent a form of marriage ceremony on 11 August 1674, but the marriage was not formalized until 6 February 1677, in her thirteenth year.

When Charles Stewart, 6th Duke of Lennox, died in 1673, Sir Edward was created Earl of Lichfield. Charlotte&#x27;s dowry was agreed at £18,000, and her husband was awarded a pension of £2,000 per year.

== Later life ==
After the death of her husband&#x27;s cousin Charles Wilmot, 3rd Earl of Rochester the couple inherited Adderbury Manor which they had torn down and then had the architect build a new Palladian manor on the spot. Lee participated in court life and was frequently in presence at Windsor castle and is mentioned by as being present at a gathering on 24 Jan 1682 in honor of the Moroccan ambassador Mohammed ben Hadou.
In 1685, her father suffered an apoplectic fit and died four days later at the Palace of Whitehall.

=== Reign of James II ===
After the death of her father in 1685, Charlotte continued to be part of the inner circle of the new king, who was her uncle James and a great favorite of his wife Mary of Modena. Charlotte&#x27;s husband became appointed as the Master of the Horse to the king.

After the birth of James Francis Edward, his father&#x27;s political enemies and her cousins, Anne and Mary, tried to claim that the newborn was not the son of James II but rather a changeling. This was in fact an effort to prevent a Catholic dynasty from ruling the country as James was not only suspect of being a catholic but also had married a catholic wife. Charlotte had not been present for the childbirth of Mary in 1688, but she was prepared to vouch for the legitimacy of her cousin.

Charlotte testified;

That she was not at the Queens Labour, (being in Child-bed her self) but that she was almost constantly with the Queen, while she was with Child, and hath put on her Smock, and seen the Milk run out of her Breast, and felt her Belly; so that she is sure she could not be deceived, but that the Queen was with Child.

=== Reign of Mary I and William II ===
Due to Charlotte and her husband&#x27;s staunch support of Charlotte&#x27;s uncle James II, who was deposed in 1689 in the Glorious Revolution, the couple was not allowed at court and Charlotte and her husband withdrew to their estate at Ditchley in Oxfordshire. In 1690, her &quot;deare brother&quot; Henry died after receiving a gunshot wound during the siege of Cork while fighting for William II. One year later, Charlotte&#x27;s younger sister, Barbara, who had been seduced by count of Arran, gave birth to an illegitimate son and was from thereon disowned by their mother and sent to a convent.

=== Reign of Anne I ===
In 1702, when Charlotte asked her cousin queen Anne if she would not allow her to attend court, Anne simply replied that no such thing was possible until Charlotte&#x27;s husband had pledged his loyalty to her. As her husband was not willing to do such a thing, they were not part of the court.

The tumultuous happenings continued, when in 1705, another scandal occurred in Charlotte&#x27;s family when her oldest daughter Charlotte and her husband Lord Baltimore were separated, followed in 1706, by Charlotte having an affair with the notorious Colonel Robert Fielding, the husband of her grandmother the Duchess of Cleveland. She was also rumoured to have given birth to child fathered by Fielding. Fielding later turned out to be a bigamist making his marriage with his lover&#x27;s grandmother illegal.

In 1709, Charlotte&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of Cleveland died of dropsy, and left in her will to her daughter Charlotte &quot;the picture of herself and the Earl of Lichfield, her husband drawn together with the picture of her grandson Lord Quarendon with the great bloodstone&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Charlotte Lee died in London on 17 February 1718, aged 53, and was buried in All Saints Churchyard in Spelsbury, Oxfordshire, England beside her husband who had died two years earlier. On their funeral monument the inscription reads;

“at their marriage they were the most grateful bridegroom and the most beautiful bride and that till death they remained the most constant husband and wife.”In her will, she left her three younger sons £100 each, and to her daughter Barbara £2000 (if she married with the consent of her brother) and £200 to the Roman Catholic bishop Bonaventure Giffard.

== Cultural mentions ==

<text>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying is a 1961 musical by Frank Loesser and book by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock, and Willie Gilbert, based on Shepherd Mead&#x27;s 1952 book of the same name. The story concerns young, ambitious J. Pierrepont Finch, who, with the help of the book &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, rises from window washer to chairman of the board of the World Wide Wicket Company.

The musical, starring Robert Morse and Rudy Vallée, opened at the 46th Street Theatre on Broadway in October 1961, running for 1,417 performances. The show won seven Tony Awards, the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle award, and the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

In 1967, a film based on the musical was released by United Artists, with Morse, Vallee, Sammy Smith, and Ruth Kobart re-creating their stage roles.

A 1995 revival was mounted at the same theatre as the original production (now named the Richard Rodgers Theatre). It ran for 548 performances and starred Matthew Broderick and Megan Mullally. A 50th-anniversary Broadway revival directed and choreographed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe and John Larroquette opened on March 27, 2011, at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre and ran for 473 performances.

==History==
In 1952, Shepherd Mead&#x27;s satirical book, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, became a bestseller. Playwrights Willie Gilbert and Jack Weinstock created a dramatic interpretation in 1955 that was unproduced for five years. Agent Abe Newborn brought the work to the attention of producers Cy Feuer and Ernest H. Martin, with the intention of retooling it as a musical. Feuer and Martin had great success with the 1950 adaptation of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and brought in the creative team from that show to work on &quot;How to...&quot;. Burrows and Loesser set to work on the new adaptation, with rehearsals beginning in August 1961. Burrows collaborated on the book with Jack Weinstock and Willie Gilbert, also serving as director. Their new adaptation became even more satirical and added romance to the story. Loesser wrote both music and lyrics for the show, which was orchestrated by Robert Ginzler.

The original Broadway production credited the choreography to an obscure dance director named Hugh Lambert, while the much better-known Bob Fosse received only a &quot;musical staging by...&quot; credit. Abe Burrows explains this in his autobiography &quot;Honest, Abe&quot;. While &quot;How to Succeed&quot; was in its early development, producer Cy Feuer attended a trade show and was extremely impressed by an elaborate dance number created by Lambert, prompting Feuer to hire Lambert to choreograph the new musical. According to Burrows, it soon became clear in rehearsals that Lambert&#x27;s creative abilities were completely used up in that one elaborate dance number. Bob Fosse was brought in to replace him, but Fosse was unwilling to hurt Lambert&#x27;s career by having him fired. Lambert&#x27;s trade-show dance number was recycled as the &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; dance in &quot;How to Succeed...&quot;, while Fosse agreed to take a &quot;musical staging&quot; credit for choreographing all the other dance numbers. Burrows also reveals that another crisis arose in rehearsals when former recording star Rudy Vallée wanted to interpolate some of his hit songs from the 1930s.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
J. Pierrepont Finch, a young window cleaner in New York City, reads the book &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; as he works. The &quot;Book Voice&quot; tells him that he will succeed if he follows the book&#x27;s advice. He enters the World Wide Wicket Company searching for a job (&quot;How To Succeed&quot;).

Finch bumps into J. B. Biggley, the president of the company, who dismisses him to the personnel manager, Mr. Bratt. Rosemary Pilkington, an ambitious young secretary, helps Finch meet Mr. Bratt. Finch tells Bratt that Biggley sent him, and Bratt gives him a job in the mailroom, where he works with Mr. Biggley&#x27;s lazy, arrogant, and nepotism-minded nephew Bud Frump. Rosemary dreams of a life with Finch in the suburbs (&quot;Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm&quot;). The fatigued workers rush to get their coffee break (&quot;Coffee Break&quot;). In the mailroom, Finch earns favor with the long-time head of the mailroom, Mr. Twimble, who tells him the secret to longevity at the company (&quot;The Company Way&quot;).

Twimble is promoted to head of the shipping department and has to choose his replacement as head of the mailroom. The book warns not to stay in the mailroom too long, so Finch recommends Frump instead of himself. Twimble is reluctant to promote the lazy Frump, but Frump promises to be a good employee (&quot;The Company Way (Reprise)&quot;). Twimble and Bratt are impressed by Finch&#x27;s apparent selflessness, and Bratt offers him a job as a junior executive in the Plans and Systems department, headed by Mr. Gatch.

An extremely attractive but air-headed woman named Hedy LaRue, who is Mr. Biggley&#x27;s secret mistress, is hired as a secretary. On her first day of work, the male employees are instantly attracted to her, but Mr. Bratt warns them against taking advantage of their employees (&quot;A Secretary Is Not a Toy&quot;). Finch learns from Mr. Biggley&#x27;s secretary, Miss Jones, that Biggley is a proud alumnus of Old Ivy College. In the elevator at the end of the workday, Rosemary&#x27;s fellow secretary Smitty helps her and Finch set up a date (&quot;Been a Long Day&quot;). Frump runs into Biggley and Hedy and realizes their relationship, and he blackmails Biggley into giving him a promotion (&quot;Been a Long Day (Reprise)&quot;).

Finch arrives early Saturday morning and sets up the office so it looks like he has been working all night. Biggley believes Finch&#x27;s ruse, and Finch convinces Biggley that he, too, is a proud alumnus of Old Ivy (a &quot;Groundhog&quot;), and they sing the Old Ivy fight song (&quot;Grand Old Ivy&quot;). Biggley insists that Finch be given his own office and secretary, Hedy. With the book&#x27;s help, Finch realizes that Biggley must be Hedy&#x27;s advocate and sends her on an errand to Gatch, knowing that Gatch will make a pass at her. Gatch falls for the trap and is dispatched to Venezuela, and Finch is promoted to his position as head of Plans and Systems.

At a reception for the new Advertising Department head, Benjamin Burton Daniel Ovington, Rosemary hopes to impress Finch with her new &quot;Paris original&quot; dress, but all the other women arrive at the reception wearing the same dress (&quot;Paris Original&quot;). Frump schemes for Biggley to catch Finch kissing LaRue in his office, but after LaRue blackmails Finch into kissing her, he realizes he&#x27;s actually in love with Rosemary (&quot;Rosemary&quot;). After some farcical complications, Frump and Biggley walk into the office just as Finch embraces Rosemary. Ovington is forced to resign when Biggley learns that he is a graduate from Northern State, Old Ivy&#x27;s bitterest rival (a &quot;Chipmunk&quot;). Biggley names Finch vice-president in charge of advertising. Biggley leaves as Finch and Rosemary declare their love for each other, and Bud Frump vows revenge (&quot;Act I Finale&quot;).

===Act II===
Two days later, Rosemary has been neglected by Finch. She decides to quit, but her fellow secretaries convince her to stay because she&#x27;s living their dream of marrying an executive (&quot;Cinderella, Darling&quot;). (In the 1995 revival, this song was replaced with a reprise of &quot;How to Succeed&quot;, with the lyrics suggesting ways in which a woman can get hold of a man&#x27;s financial assets).
The book warns Finch that because vice-president of advertising is a bad position, he needs a brilliant idea. Bud Frump slyly tells Finch his idea for a treasure hunt, which Finch loves, unaware that Biggley has already heard the idea and rejected it. Finch shares the idea with Rosemary, who tells him that she&#x27;ll stay with him no matter what happens (&quot;Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm (Reprise)&quot;). Hedy tells Biggley that she is unhappy as a secretary and is leaving for California. He begs her to stay and tells her he loves her, and she agrees to stay (&quot;Love From a Heart of Gold&quot;). In the executive washroom, Finch gives himself a pep talk while, behind his back, the other executives and Frump plot against him (&quot;I Believe In You&quot;).

Finch presents &quot;his&quot; idea to Biggley: he will hide five thousand shares of company stock in each of the ten offices around the country and give a television audience weekly clues as to their whereabouts. Biggley accepts this idea when Finch explains that each clue will be given by the scantily-dressed World Wide Wicket Treasure Girl: Miss Hedy LaRue.

During the first television show, Hedy is asked to swear on a Bible that she doesn&#x27;t know the location of the prizes. Hedy panics and reveals the locations to the entire television audience, which prompts all the Wicket employees to tear apart the offices looking for them. The book tells Finch, &quot;How To Handle a Disaster. ...We suggest that your best bet if you are the cause of the Disaster is to review the first chapter of this book: &#x27;How to Apply for a Job&#x27;.&quot;

The executives, including Chairman of the Board Wally Womper, are waiting in Biggley&#x27;s office for Finch&#x27;s resignation. Rosemary again tells Finch that she&#x27;ll stand by him no matter what (&quot;I Believe in You (Reprise)&quot;). About to sign his letter of resignation, Finch mentions that he&#x27;ll probably go back to washing windows. Womper is drawn to Finch as he, too, was a window washer and they both &quot;had a book&quot;: Wally&#x27;s book was a book of betting records. Finch blames the treasure hunt on Frump, also mentioning that Frump is Biggley&#x27;s nephew. Womper is about to &quot;clean house from top to bottom&quot;, when Finch steps in on everyone&#x27;s behalf. Finch tells the executives that even though the business world is a place filled with betrayal and competitiveness, the World Wide Wicket staff is like a family to him (&quot;Brotherhood of Man&quot;). Everyone is spared except Frump, who is fired because he is Biggley&#x27;s nephew.

Biggley remains president, Womper retires to travel the world with his new wife, Hedy, and Finch becomes chairman of the board. Rosemary stands by his side and inadvertently inspires him to aspire for the Presidency of the United States. Frump gets a job washing windows, swearing revenge against Finch (&quot;Company Way (Finale)&quot;).

==Film adaptation==

In 1967, United Artists released a film adapted and directed by David Swift. Robert Morse, Rudy Vallée, Michele Lee (who replaced Bonnie Scott as Rosemary during the show&#x27;s Broadway run), Sammy Smith and Ruth Kobart recreated their roles for the film, and Fosse again choreographed. Several songs were omitted from the score, such as &quot;Love From a Heart of Gold,&quot; &quot;Happy to Keep His Dinner Warm,&quot; &quot;Cinderella Darling,&quot; &quot;Paris Original,&quot; and &quot;Coffee Break&quot;, although there are musical and verbal references respectively to the last two. In the film&#x27;s finale, Frump was among the entire company singing a finale version of &quot;The Company Way.&quot;

==Television adaptation==
The musical was adapted by Burrows for a television production starring Alan Bursky, Susan Blanchard and Larry Haines, directed by Burt Brinckerhoff. The production aired as an ABC Comedy Special on June 27, 1975.

==Critical reception==
The original 1961 Broadway production opened to highly positive reviews. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Howard Taubman wrote, &quot;It stings mischievously and laughs uproariously...It belongs to the blue chips among modern musicals.&quot; Taubman praised the show&#x27;s &quot;adult viewpoint and consistency of style&quot;, stating that Burrows had &quot;directed brilliantly&quot; and that Loesser had &quot;written lyrics with an edge and tunes with a grin...the songs sharpen the ridicule.&quot; Taubman stated Robert Morse played Finch &quot;with unfailing bravura and wit&quot;, pronouncing Finch, as portrayed by Morse, &quot;a rumpled, dimpled angel with a streak of Lucifer.&quot; John Chapman of the &quot;Daily News&quot; deemed it &quot;the definitive musical about high life in the city&quot; with &quot;perfect musical comedy construction.&quot; Chapman declared that &quot;Loesser is the perfect man for his end of the show - the songs; for he is a cynic without being tough. He has not put in a note of music or a syllable of lyric that doesn&#x27;t carry the story along.&quot; Richard Watts, Jr. of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote, &quot;In its first performance at the 46th St. Theater Saturday night, its satire, humor, book, music, lyrics, cast, staging, choreography, setting and general gaiety of spirit combined in a smooth, fast pattern of expert showmanship to make the occasion a delightful event.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, critic Walter Kerr stated, &quot;Not a sincere line is spoken in the new Abe Burrows-Frank Loesser musical, and what a relief that is...&quot;How to Succeed&quot; is crafty, conniving, sneaky, cynical, irreverent, impertinent, sly, malicious, and lovely, just lovely.&quot; He opined that Burrows was most responsible for the musical&#x27;s success, pronouncing, &quot;What most distinguishes a sassy, gay, and exhilarating evening is--you&#x27;ll never believe this--the book...Gags are subordinated to impish running commentary; Mr Loesser&#x27;s perky score is subordinated to the merry malice that is afoot.&quot; John McClain of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; declared it to be &quot;The most inventive and stylized and altogether infectious new musical in recent recollection&quot;, pronouncing it &quot;the sheerest farce..gay, zingy, amoral, witty and shot with style. It comes very close to being a new form in musicals.&quot; He praised Loesser&#x27;s score, saying, &quot;All the music has been integrated into the plot, to fit the mood as well as the momentum. His lyrics are generally superb.&quot; McClain particularly noted Bob Fosse&#x27;s choreography, saying that his dances were &quot;a whole new chapter in ingenuity.&quot; Norman Nadel of the &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot; declared, &quot;Whichever white winged angel watches over theatrical enterprises was sitting on top of the 46th St. Theatre Saturday night, joyously blasting away on a solid gold trumpet.&quot;

In contrast, in their reviews of the 2011 Broadway revival, the &quot;New York Times&quot; chief theater critic Ben Brantley warns that the show&#x27;s book writers &quot;failed to give Ponty any defining traits beyond all-consuming ambition&quot; and that &quot;you don’t particularly want [Daniel Radcliffe&#x27;s] character in the show to succeed, and that really is a problem.&quot; Charles McNulty of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that the musical &quot;is hampered by a dated book&quot; and that its &quot;episodic structure now seems as belabored as a sitcom plucked from a rusty time capsule&quot;, while &quot;all the romantic brouhaha with moony secretaries is beyond retro.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
The show was the second musical in three years to win the top three theatre awards - Tony, the New York Drama Critics Circle award, and the Pulitzer Prize - following the success of &quot;Fiorello!&quot;. It was only the fourth musical to win the Pulitzer after &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; (1932), &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1950) and &quot;Fiorello!&quot;.

<text>Explorers on the Moon (; literally: &quot;We walked on the Moon&quot;) is the seventeenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised weekly in Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from October 1952 to December 1953 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1954. Completing a story arc begun in the preceding volume, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1953), the narrative tells of the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and friends Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and Thomson and Thompson who are aboard humanity&#x27;s first crewed rocket mission to the Moon.

Developed in part through the suggestions of Hergé&#x27;s friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was produced following Hergé&#x27;s extensive research into the possibility of human space travel – a feat that had yet to be achieved – with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have held the illustrative detail of the book in high regard, but have expressed divided opinions of the story; some consider it to be among the most mature and emotionally resonant entries in the series, while others fault it for downplaying the humour seen in previous volumes in favour of the scientific focus of the narrative. The story was adapted for the 1957 Belvision animated series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1989 computer game &quot;Tintin on the Moon&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;.

==Synopsis==
:&quot;The synopsis continues a plot begun in &quot;Destination Moon&quot;.&quot;

Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus&#x27;s assistant Frank Wolff are aboard an atomic rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth bound for the Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away on board, thinking the launch was set for 1:34 P.M., and not A.M., putting a strain on the oxygen supply. The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem. They then suffer a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours, until Calculus subsequently administers a cure. Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becomes a satellite of the asteroid Adonis, but Tintin is able to rescue him.

The rocket lands in the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first human to step on the Moon. Next day, Calculus and Wolff set up optical instruments to begin observational work on the Moon while Tintin and Haddock build the Moon tank. Two days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the Moon tank to explore some stalactite caves in the direction of the Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is ambushed and left bound in the hold by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works and Snowy&#x27;s leg gets injured while being ambushed by Jorgen. Tintin finally places the bandages around Snowy&#x27;s injured leg to heal completely. With Wolff&#x27;s help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but Tintin escapes and foils him through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.

Due to the strain on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon the Moon tank and the optical instruments and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket is cleared for lift-off. After launch, Jorgen escapes his bonds due to the detectives&#x27; bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others with a gun; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over the gun, Jorgen is shot through his heart, killing him. When it is revealed that there will not be enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating out into space to his death. Upon approaching Earth, the crew falls unconscious, but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely. After landing, the crew is rescued in the nick of time. During the heroes&#x27; welcome home party, Calculus hopes they may return to the Moon someday, but Haddock refuses, revealing that the expedition has taught him that &quot;Man&#x27;s proper place is on dear old Earth&quot;.

==History==
===Background===
Hergé first devised the idea of sending Tintin on a mission to the Moon while he was working on &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; (1949). His decision to move into the field of science fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had recently had success with his own science fiction comic, &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot; (1950–53). He decided that it would be a two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; (1936), &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (1943) and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; (1948) and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.

Seeking advice on the story, Hergé consulted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, who had authored the non-fiction book &quot;L&#x27;Homme parmi les étoiles&quot; (&quot;Man Among the Stars&quot;) (1944). In autumn 1947, Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke developed a script for the story, which they gave to Hergé. This version based Calculus&#x27; lunar expedition in a fictional location, Radio City, in the United States. It featured a return of Professor Decimus Phostle, a character who had previously appeared in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; (1942), but this time as an antagonist; Phostle had sold the secrets of the mission in order to attain funds to buy a diamond for the actress Rita Hayworth. In early 1948, Hergé produced two black-and-white pages of this version of the story before abandoning it. Hergé retained some elements of this original script in his finished version, namely the scenes in which Haddock drinks whiskey in a gravity-free environment and that in which Haddock goes for a space walk and nearly becomes a satellite of Adonis, which appear on pages 5 and 8 of &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;.

Nevertheless, Heuvelmans thought his influence on the story to be more significant, stating that &quot;in going through the two books we [he and Van Melkebeke] really had the impression that it was what we had originally done at the beginning. In broad outline, that was it&quot;.

Hergé hoped for the story to be as realistic as possible, and sought to eschew fantastical elements. In his own words, it contained &quot;no moonmen, no monsters, no incredible surprises&quot;. To ensure this realism, he collected a wide range of documents about rockets and space travel with which to conduct research. In this he was aided by Heuvelmans, who collected pictures of rockets and atomic research facilities for him. Hergé&#x27;s research archive included an article from the American magazine &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; which discussed how humanity could reach the Moon, as well as books by Pierre Rousseau and Auguste Piccard. A further work that he used was &quot;L&#x27;Astronautique&quot; (1950), a book on putative space travel by the physicist Alexander Ananoff, with whom Hergé began a correspondence in April 1950. He also visited the Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi&#x27;s Center for Atomic Research, striking up a subsequent correspondence with its director, Max Hoyaux. Hergé incorporated much of this technical information into the story, but juxtaposed it with moments of humour to make it more accessible to his young readership.

According to literary critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé&#x27;s story include Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Around the Moon&quot; and the 1950 American film &quot;Destination Moon&quot;. Hergé was certainly inspired by a number of photographic stills from the &quot;Destination Moon&quot; film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his Moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé&#x27;s rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon&#x27;s 1947 book &quot;German Research in World War II&quot;. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a Moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.
Hergé introduced into the story the character of Boris Jorgen, who had previously appeared as an antagonist in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; (1939).
He added evidence for water on the Moon on the advice of Heuvelmans.

===Publication===
On 7 September 1950, Hergé broke off the story with the statement &quot;end of part one&quot;. He felt the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and his wife Germaine went on holiday to Gland in Switzerland, before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine asking why &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. On 18 April 1951, he published an open letter in the magazine explaining his absence as a result of illness caused by exhaustion and included an illustration of himself sprawled out on an armchair. As Hergé planned his return to work, covers of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine announced the imminent return of the story.

&quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; would resume after an eighteen-month hiatus, returning in the 9 April 1952 issue, accompanied with a summary of the story so far. Its final installment appeared on 31 December 1953.

===Republication===
Upon the serial&#x27;s publication, Hergé faced criticism for including Wolff&#x27;s suicide in the story; suicide was widely viewed as a sin in Catholic-dominated Belgium. In deference to these critics, for the published book version he added Wolff&#x27;s line of &quot;perhaps by some miracle I shall escape too&quot;, to make the scene seem a less obvious suicide. Years later, Hergé expressed regret that he had capitulated on this issue.
The story was collected together and published by Editions Casterman as &quot;On a Marché Sur La Lune&quot; in 1954. Casterman were unhappy with this title, which translates as &quot;We Walked on the Moon&quot;, but Hergé resolutely refused to make a change.

==Critical analysis==
Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that the two-part story &quot;belongs&quot; to Calculus as his &quot;cosmic vision moves the story forward&quot;. They further expressed the opinion that Wolff was a unique character in the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, suggesting that he is akin to a character from a John le Carré novel. Referring specifically to &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, they opined that it was &quot;a true epic of the human imagination&quot;, believing that its depiction of the Moon has &quot;withstood the test of time&quot; more than other &quot;proto-space exploration novels&quot;. They felt that the Moon adventure was &quot;Hergé at his best... a triumphant achievement on every level&quot;, awarding both halves of the story five stars out of five.

Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline felt that the two Moon adventures &quot;mark a stage in the development of Hergé&#x27;s work&quot;. Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters praised the &quot;gradual introduction into the story of a real dimension of evil&quot; as being something particularly effective. He also expressed the view that Wolff brings &quot;a tragic note&quot; to the story, comparing him to the characters in the stories of Graham Greene. He was critical of the two-part story arc, stating that they had &quot;neither the liveliness and dynamism&quot; of &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, &quot;nor the supernatural quality&quot; of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;-&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;.

Harry Thompson noted that &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was widely regarded as Hergé&#x27;s &quot;greatest artistic achievement&quot;, describing the entire Moon adventure as &quot;a technical masterpiece&quot; as a result of its &quot;uncannily accurate&quot; depiction of the Moon. Thompson expressed his opinion that &quot;Explorers&quot; could be compared to the work of science-fiction writers Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Focusing on the scene in which the Thom(p)sons&#x27; hair grows rapidly in bright colours, he stated that it provides an abrupt contrast with &quot;the almost scholastic nature of the rest of the story&quot;, and that it &quot;injects a few bright splashes&quot; into an otherwise &quot;carefully restrained colour scheme&quot;. Philippe Goddin praised the depiction of the rocket&#x27;s landing as &quot;a magnificent spectacle, well worth the double space spread given by Hergé&quot;, also highlighting what he perceived as the ending&#x27;s &quot;unprecedented dramatic tension&quot;.

In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès praised the &quot;Destination Moon&quot;-&quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; story arc for its &quot;meticulous attention to scientific facts&quot;, but added that this had also resulted in the story&#x27;s &quot;rather pedagogical tone&quot;. He added that in these stories, the main division was &quot;no longer Good and Evil&quot; as it had been in previous &quot;Adventures&quot;, but &quot;Truth and Error&quot;. Apostolidès opined that despite being a &quot;fussy and somewhat ridiculous character&quot;, through his scientific achievements Calculus grows to the &quot;stature of a giant&quot; in this arc, eclipsing Sir Francis Haddock (from &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;) as the series&#x27; &quot;founding ancestor&quot;. He goes on to claim that in becoming the &quot;sacred ancestor&quot;, the voyage to the Moon becomes &quot;a mystical quest&quot; with science as its guiding religion. Drawing comparisons between this arc and the &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; story, he drew symbolic links between the scientific centre and the Inca Temple of the Sun, but noted that here Calculus was the &quot;high priest&quot; rather than the sacrificial victim as he had been in the previous story.
Moving on to discuss the Moon rocket in these stories, Apostolidès described it as a phallic object which penetrated the &quot;virgin territory&quot; of the Moon. At the same time, he described the rocket as a &quot;maternal belly&quot; in which the space explorers slept. Commenting specifically on &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; he commented that the protagonists of the story reverted to childhood when exploring the Moon, believing that they had treated it like a theme park.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that in the &quot;Destination Moon&quot;-&quot;Explorers of the Moon&quot; story arc, Calculus &quot;embodies Hergé&#x27;s... own wartime position, spun out into a post-war environment&quot;, representing a genius driven by his work whose activities are coincidental to national and political causes. He suggested that &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was &quot;perhaps both the most wildly adventurous and the most contemplative&quot; instalment in the series. He felt that the inclusion of Jorgen being smuggled aboard the rocket as a stowaway reflected the idea of the &quot;stranger&quot; penetrating the &quot;home&quot;, something which he thought was present in other &quot;Adventures&quot;. Commenting on the scene in which Haddock smuggles a whisky bottle inside the &quot;Guide to Astronomy&quot;, he states &quot;the text, in this case, is hollow, smuggling something else&quot;, which he believed was a reversal of the appearance of a parchment hidden within a model ship in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;.

==Adaptation==
In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based on Hergé&#x27;s original comics, adapting eight of the &quot;Adventures&quot; into a series of daily five-minute episodes. &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was the second to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a second animated series based upon &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was the fifteenth story to be adapted and was divided into two twenty-minute episodes. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot; to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé&#x27;s original panels.

<text>In biochemistry, hydrolases constitute a class of enzymes that commonly function as biochemical catalysts that use water to break a chemical bond:

:formula_1

This typically results in dividing a larger molecule into smaller molecules. Some common examples of hydrolase enzymes are esterases including lipases, phosphatases, glycosidases, peptidases, and nucleosidases.

Esterases cleave ester bonds in lipids and phosphatases cleave phosphate groups off molecules. An example of crucial esterase is acetylcholine esterase, which assists in transforming the neuron impulse into the acetate group after the hydrolase breaks the acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. Acetic acid is an important metabolite in the body and a critical intermediate for other reactions such as glycolysis. Lipases hydrolyze glycerides. Glycosidases cleave sugar molecules off carbohydrates and peptidases hydrolyze peptide bonds. Nucleosidases hydrolyze the bonds of nucleotides.

Hydrolase enzymes are important for the body because they have degradative properties. In lipids, lipases contribute to the breakdown of fats and lipoproteins and other larger molecules into smaller molecules like fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids and other small molecules are used for synthesis and as a source of energy.

==Nomenclature==
Systematic names of hydrolases are formed as &quot;substrate hydrolase.&quot; However, common names are typically in the form &quot;substrate base&quot;. For example, a nuclease is a hydrolase that cleaves nucleic acids.

==Classification==
Hydrolases are classified as EC 3 in the EC number classification of enzymes. Hydrolases can be further classified into several subclasses, based upon the bonds they act upon:
*EC 3.1: ester bonds (esterases: nucleases, phosphodiesterases, lipase, phosphatase)
*EC 3.2: sugars (DNA glycosylases, glycoside hydrolase)
*EC 3.3: ether bonds
*EC 3.4: peptide bonds (Proteases/peptidases)
*EC 3.5: carbon-nitrogen bonds, other than peptide bonds
*EC 3.6 acid anhydrides (acid anhydride hydrolases, including helicases and GTPase)
*EC 3.7 carbon-carbon bonds
*EC 3.8 halide bonds
*EC 3.9: phosphorus-nitrogen bonds
*EC 3.10: sulphur-nitrogen bonds
*EC 3.11: carbon-phosphorus bonds
*EC 3.12: sulfur-sulfur bonds
*EC 3.13: carbon-sulfur bonds

==Clinical considerations==
Hydrolase secreted by &quot;Lactobacillus jensenii&quot; in the human gut stimulates the liver to secrete bile salts that aids in the digestion of food.

==Membrane-associated hydrolases==
Many hydrolases, and especially proteases associate with biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or anchored through a single transmembrane helix. Some others are multi-span transmembrane proteins, for example rhomboid protease.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;hydrolase&quot; () suffixes the combining form of &quot;&quot; to the &quot;hydrol&quot; syllables of &quot;hydrolysis&quot;.

*Phosphorylase
*Serine hydrolase
*Cadmium-transporting ATPase

<doc id="548003" wikidata="Q935984" url="?curid=548003" title="The Calculus Affair">
<text>The Calculus Affair () is the eighteenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé. It was serialised weekly in Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from December 1954 to February 1956 before being published in a single volume by Casterman in 1956. The story follows the attempts of the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friend Captain Haddock to rescue their friend Professor Calculus, who has developed a machine capable of destroying objects with sound waves, from kidnapping attempts by the competing European countries of Borduria and Syldavia.

Like the previous volume, &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; was created with the aid of Hergé&#x27;s team of artists at Studios Hergé. The story reflected the Cold War tensions that Europe was experiencing during the 1950s, and introduced three recurring characters into the series: Jolyon Wagg, Cutts the Butcher, and Colonel Sponsz. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; was critically well-received, with various commentators having described it as one of the best Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and the 1992–93 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
During a thunderstorm, glass and porcelain items at Marlinspike Hall shatter inexplicably. Insurance salesman Jolyon Wagg arrives at the house to take shelter, annoying Captain Haddock. Gunshots are heard in the Hall&#x27;s grounds, and Tintin and Haddock discover an unconscious man with a foreign accent who soon disappears with an accomplice. The next morning, Professor Calculus leaves for Geneva to attend a conference on nuclear physics. Tintin and Haddock use the opportunity to investigate Calculus&#x27; laboratory, discovering that his experiments were responsible for the glass-shattering of the previous night. While exploring, they are attacked by a masked stranger, who then takes off. While escaping, Snowy rips the stranger&#x27;s coat, causing a cigarette packet to fall off. On the packet, the name of &quot;Hotel Cornavin, Geneva&quot; where Calculus stays was written on it. Tintin fears that Calculus is in danger. Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy head for Geneva. In Geneva, they learn that Calculus has gone to Nyon to meet Professor Topolino, an expert in ultrasonics. The group travel there in a taxi, but their car is attacked by two men in another car, who force the taxi into Lake Geneva. Surviving the attack, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy continue to Nyon, where they find Topolino bound and gagged in his cellar. As Tintin questions the professor, the house blows up, but they all survive.

Tintin and Haddock meet the detectives Thomson and Thompson, who reveal that the man at Marlinspike was Syldavian. Tintin surmises that Calculus had invented an ultrasonic device capable of being used as a weapon of mass destruction, which Bordurian intelligence agents are now seeking to obtain. Suspecting that Bordurian spies have kidnapped Calculus and are holding him hostage in their Rolle embassy, Tintin and Haddock seek to rescue him. During the attempt, a scuffle breaks out between Syldavian and Bordurian agents, in which Tintin is knocked down, and Calculus is captured by the Syldavian agents, who are able to escape by plane to their home country. The next morning, Tintin and Haddock learn that Bordurian fighter aircraft forced down the Syldavian plane and recaptured Calculus, who is now being held in Borduria. They travel to Borduria&#x27;s capital, Szohôd, intent on rescuing him.

In the city, they are escorted to their hotel by agents of the Bordurian secret police, who have been ordered by police chief Colonel Sponsz to monitor the duo. Aware that they are being monitored, Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house, where Bianca Castafiore is performing. When police come searching for them, they hide in Castafiore&#x27;s closet. When Sponsz comes to visit Castafiore in her dressing room, Tintin is able to steal papers from his overcoat pocket that will secure Calculus&#x27; release from the fortress of Bakhine. After disguising themselves as officials from the International Red Cross, Tintin and Haddock are able to get Calculus released from prison. During their escape, they drive off the road, but are able to hijack a tank and narrowly escape across the border. At the lost property office, a relieved Calculus finally collects the black umbrella by Snowy alongside Tintin and Haddock. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Wagg moves his family in. Meanwhile, Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva, and that he had left them at home all along; he announces his intention to destroy the plans so they cannot be used to create a weapon. Haddock lights his pipe with the intention of smoking it, but Calculus uses it to burn the plans. Haddock&#x27;s fit of rage over the plans literally burning up in his face leaves the hard-of-hearing Calculus believing that Haddock has chickenpox; Calculus relays this to Wagg, who moves his family out of Marlinspike Hall to avoid a contagious disease.

== History ==

=== Background ===

Reflecting Cold War tensions, &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; was published at a time when espionage thrillers were popular in France and Belgium. 
&quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; marked a return to the single volume format which was to persist for the rest of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The volume started its publication in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in December 1954. Before working on the book, Hergé would make sketches in pencil; subsequently he would work over the drawings and text in ink. With the development of his own Studios Hergé, he selected the best sketch from a number of versions and traced it onto the page he was creating.

In &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; Hergé introduced Jolyon Wagg, a Belgian insurance salesman, who appeared in each subsequent adventure with the exception of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. Wagg was intended as &quot;the proverbial bore&quot;, who provides comic relief by repeatedly annoying Captain Haddock and inviting himself to Marlinspike. For the name, Séraphin Lampion in the original French version, Hergé initially chose &quot;Crampon&quot;, which was derived from the French expression &quot;Quel crampon!&quot; (English: &quot;What a leech!&quot;), but ultimately preferred the less explicit and harsh-sounding &quot;Lampion&quot;. Lampion&#x27;s insurance company was &quot;Assurances Mondass&quot;, which in the English translation became the Rock Bottom Insurance Company.

Also introduced in this volume were Cutts the butcher (originally &quot;Sanzot&quot; from the French &quot;sans os&quot; (&quot;without bones&quot;)) and the Bordurian chief of secret police Colonel Sponsz, whose name is derived from the Brussels dialect term for a sponge (&quot;éponge&quot; in French). Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.

=== Influences ===

A key influence on the plot of &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly &quot;La Face à Main&quot;, reporting that there had been a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists&#x27; car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article&#x27;s author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.

Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Switzerland avoided repeating national clichés, instead seeking a high level of realism. Hergé requested that Jean Dupont, the editor of &quot;L&#x27;Écho illustré&quot; — the magazine in which &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was serialised in Switzerland — send him documentation on Swiss railways from which he could draw. He also requested that his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine, which he could again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland in person to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva, which he could then incorporate into the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, as well as the road through Cervens and Topolino&#x27;s house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Geneva.
Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Borduria was based on Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria &quot;Plekszy-Gladz&quot;, a pun on Plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him &quot;Kûrvi-Tasch&quot; (&quot;curvy tash&quot;), a reference to the fact that the leader&#x27;s curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.

The idea of a sonic weapon was one that had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German scientists under the control of Albert Speer during World War II.A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino&#x27;s house, &quot;German Research in World War II&quot; by Leslie E. Simon – a retired major general in the United States Army – really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English-language title of the book rather than translating it into French, although altered the book&#x27;s cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion of the book is one of the few instances that there is any reference to the Second World War within &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The photograph of the sonic weapon is also authentic.

Hergé&#x27;s decision to name a character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney, whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian. Hergé included a reference to his friend and colleague, the former opera singer Edgar P. Jacobs, in the story, adding a figure named &quot;Jacobini&quot; to the billing on the opera performance alongside Castafiore. He also inserted a cameo of himself as a reporter.

=== Publication ===
&quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; began serialisation in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Christmas edition on 22 December 1954, and continued to appear in the pages of that publication until 22 February 1956. It would be the first of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be serialised without interruption since &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (1944). Serialisation began in the French edition of &quot;Tintin&quot; in February 1955. It was subsequently published in single form as &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Tournesol&quot; by Casterman in 1956. For this volume Hergé had designed a front cover; initially, it simply showed Tintin and Haddock hiding Calculus from Bordurian soldiers, but he subsequently added shattered yellow glass around the edges of the image for dramatic effect.

== Critical analysis ==

Harry Thompson opined that while the story&#x27;s ending was somewhat unsatisfactory and rushed, it remained &quot;probably the best of all the Tintin books&quot;. Biographer Benoît Peeters agreed, describing it as &quot;Hergé&#x27;s masterwork&quot;, &quot;a masterpiece of the classic strip cartoon&quot;. Elsewhere, he referred to it as &quot;one of his most brilliant books&quot;, describing Wagg as &quot;the last great figure of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;&quot;. Peeters added that the story had &quot;the atmosphere of a spy novel worthy of John Buchan or Eric Ambler&quot;. Similarly, Farr described &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; as &quot;one of Hergé&#x27;s finest creations&quot;. Biographer Pierre Assouline stated that the &quot;illustrations and the scenario are vibrant and rich; the story thread holds from beginning to end&quot;.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier stated that the introduction of Wagg and Cutts the butcher represented &quot;yet another turning point in the series&quot;, praising the characterisation of Wagg as &quot;bitter and successful social satire&quot;. They were critical of Syldavia&#x27;s inclusion as an antagonist in the story, stating that the Syldavian attempts to kidnap Calculus &quot;strains believability&quot; because they had appeared as allies of Calculus and Tintin in both the preceding two-volume story arc, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1953) and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; (1954), and in the earlier &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; (1939). The Lofficiers felt that &quot;the plot seems somewhat shoe-horned into the familiar universe&quot; and &quot;one feels that Hergé&#x27;s heart was not really much into the action part of the story&quot;, ultimately awarding it three stars out of five.

In his psychoanalytical study of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès declared that &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; marked the beginning of the third and final period of the series, which he believed could be characterised by Hergé&#x27;s depiction of a world run by &quot;wheeling and dealing&quot; and in which &quot;detective work takes precedence over any mystical quest&quot;. Apostolidès considered &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; to be both Calculus&#x27; &quot;triumph and his defeat&quot;. He felt that while Calculus had become &quot;an impartial figure&quot; in the preceding two-volume story arc, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, here he had become &quot;the Bad Mother&quot; through his creation of an ultrasonic weapon and the threat that he poses both to the tranquility of Marlinspike and to world peace. He viewed the scene at the end of the story in which Calculus burns the plans to his ultrasonic device as &quot;a symbolic castration&quot;, allowing the character to become &quot;the Oedipal Father with whom the sons [Tintin and Haddock] can compete&quot;, thus stabilising &quot;the family hierarchy&quot; of the series.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; aptly illustrated how Tintin was no longer political in the manner that he was in earlier works like &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; (1930) and &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; (1931); instead, Tintin travels to Borduria to rescue Calculus, &quot;not to fight or expose totalitarianism&quot;. Calculus became &quot;a genius compromised&quot;, with his role being a &quot;counter-position to, or flip-side of, the one he represented in the moon books&quot;. When Tintin and Haddock arrive in Borduria, they are &quot;&quot;treated&quot; as honoured guests but are in fact prisoners of the police state&quot;, a reversal of the situation in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; in which Tintin believes himself a prisoner but is in fact a guest. As with &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; (1941), &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; was &quot;one long tobacco-trail&quot; with cigarettes representing clues throughout the story. As for the opera house scene in which Tintin and Haddock spy upon Sponsz and Castafiore, he compared it to the scene in David Lynch&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; in which Jeffrey Beaumont spies on the sexual activities of Dorothy Vallens and Frank Booth.

== Adaptations ==
In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based upon Hergé&#x27;s original comics, adapting eight of the &quot;Adventures&quot; into a series (named &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;) of daily five-minute episodes. &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; (renamed &quot;The Calculus Case&quot;) was the eighth such story in the second series, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, himself a well-known cartoonist who in later years would become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 22 minutes long. &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; was the sixteenth and seventeenth episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be produced. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

<text>South Oyster Bay or East Bay is a lagoon and natural harbor along the western portion of the south shore of Long Island in New York in the United States. The harbor is formed by Jones Beach Island, a barrier island on the southern side of Long Island. It is approximately 3 mi (5 km) wide between the two islands, and approximately 15 mi (24 km) long. It links to Great South Bay on its eastern end and opens to the Atlantic Ocean through inlets on either side of Jones Beach Island.

The name refers to its history as one of the finest oyster beds in the world.

<text>The slit-scan photography technique is a photographic and cinematographic process where a moveable slide, into which a slit has been cut, is inserted between the camera and the subject to be photographed.

More generally, &quot;slit-scan photography&quot; refers to cameras that use a slit, which is particularly used in scanning cameras in panoramic photography. This has numerous applications. This article discusses the manual artistic technique.

==Use in cinematography==

Originally used in static photography to achieve blurriness or deformity, the slit-scan technique was perfected for the creation of spectacular animations. It enables the cinematographer to create a psychedelic flow of colors. Though this type of effect is now often created through computer animation, slit-scan is a mechanical technique.

John Whitney developed it for the opening credits of the Hitchcock film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. After he sent some test sequences on film to Stanley Kubrick, the technique was adapted by Douglas Trumbull for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968 for the &quot;star gate&quot; sequence, which required a custom-built machine.

This type of effect was used in other films and television productions. Slit-scan was used by Bernard Lodge to create the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; title sequences for Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker used between December 1973 and January 1980. Slit-scan was also used in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994) to create the &quot;stretching&quot; of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D when it engaged warp drive. Due to the expense and difficulty of this technique, the same three warp-entry shots, all created by Industrial Light and Magic for the series pilot, were reused throughout the series virtually every time the ship went into warp. Slit-scan photography was also used on &quot;Interstellar&quot; for scenes in the tesseract at the end of the movie.

==Description==
Slit-scan is an animation created image by image. Its principle is based upon the camera’s relative movement in relation to a light source, combined with a long exposure time. The process is as follows:

#An abstract colored design is painted on a transparent support
#This support is set down on the glass of a backlighting table and covered with an opaque masking into which one or more slits have been carved.
#The camera (placed high on top of a vertical ramp and decentered in relation to the light slits) takes a single photograph while moving down the ramp. The result: at the top of the ramp, when it is far away, the camera takes a rather precise picture of the light slit. This image gets progressively bigger and eventually shifts itself out of the frame. This produces a light trail, which meets up with the edge of the screen.
#These steps are repeated for each image, lightly peeling back the masking, which at the same time produces variation in colors as well as variation of the position of the light stream, thus creating the animation.

Naturally, this effect is very time-consuming, and thus expensive, to create. A 10-second sequence at 24 frames per second requires a minimum of 240 adjustments.

<doc id="548012" wikidata="Q407355" url="?curid=548012" title="Transferase">
<text>In biochemistry, a transferase is any one of a class of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of specific functional groups (e.g. a methyl or glycosyl group) from one molecule (called the donor) to another (called the acceptor). They are involved in hundreds of different biochemical pathways throughout biology, and are integral to some of life&#x27;s most important processes.

Transferases are involved in myriad reactions in the cell. Three examples of these reactions are the activity of coenzyme A (CoA) transferase, which transfers thiol esters, the action of N-acetyltransferase, which is part of the pathway that metabolizes tryptophan, and the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA. Transferases are also utilized during translation. In this case, an amino acid chain is the functional group transferred by a peptidyl transferase. The transfer involves the removal of the growing amino acid chain from the tRNA molecule in the A-site of the ribosome and its subsequent addition to the amino acid attached to the tRNA in the P-site.

Mechanistically, an enzyme that catalyzed the following reaction would be a transferase:

:formula_1

In the above reaction (where the dash represents a bond, not a minus sign), X would be the donor, and Y would be the acceptor. R denotes the functional group transferred as a result of transferase activity. The donor is often a coenzyme.

==History==
Some of the most important discoveries relating to transferases occurred as early as the 1930s. Earliest discoveries of transferase activity occurred in other classifications of enzymes, including beta-galactosidase, protease, and acid/base phosphatase. Prior to the realization that individual enzymes were capable of such a task, it was believed that two or more enzymes enacted functional group transfers.
Transamination, or the transfer of an amine (or NH2) group from an amino acid to a keto acid by an aminotransferase (also known as a &quot;transaminase&quot;), was first noted in 1930 by Dorothy M. Needham, after observing the disappearance of glutamic acid added to pigeon breast muscle. This observance was later verified by the discovery of its reaction mechanism by Braunstein and Kritzmann in 1937. Their analysis showed that this reversible reaction could be applied to other tissues. This assertion was validated by Rudolf Schoenheimer&#x27;s work with radioisotopes as tracers in 1937. This in turn would pave the way for the possibility that similar transfers were a primary means of producing most amino acids via amino transfer.

Another such example of early transferase research and later reclassification involved the discovery of uridyl transferase. In 1953, the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was shown to be a transferase, when it was found that it could reversibly produce UTP and G1P from UDP-glucose and an organic pyrophosphate.

Another example of historical significance relating to transferase is the discovery of the mechanism of catecholamine breakdown by catechol-O-methyltransferase. This discovery was a large part of the reason for Julius Axelrod’s 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Sir Bernard Katz and Ulf von Euler).

Classification of transferases continues to this day, with new ones being discovered frequently. An example of this is Pipe, a sulfotransferase involved in the dorsal-ventral patterning of &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Initially, the exact mechanism of Pipe was unknown, due to a lack of information on its substrate. Research into Pipe&#x27;s catalytic activity eliminated the likelihood of it being a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan. Further research has shown that Pipe targets the ovarian structures for sulfation. Pipe is currently classified as a &quot;Drosophila&quot; heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase.

==Nomenclature==
Systematic names of transferases are constructed in the form of &quot;donor:acceptor grouptransferase.&quot; For example, methylamine:L-glutamate N-methyltransferase would be the standard naming convention for the transferase methylamine-glutamate N-methyltransferase, where methylamine is the donor, L-glutamate is the acceptor, and methyltransferase is the EC category grouping. This same action by the transferase can be illustrated as follows:
:methylamine + L-glutamate formula_2 NH3 + N-methyl-L-glutamate
However, other accepted names are more frequently used for transferases, and are often formed as &quot;acceptor grouptransferase&quot; or &quot;donor grouptransferase.&quot; For example, a DNA methyltransferase is a transferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group to a DNA acceptor. In practice, many molecules are not referred to using this terminology due to more prevalent common names. For example, RNA polymerase is the modern common name for what was formerly known as RNA nucleotidyltransferase, a kind of nucleotidyl transferase that transfers nucleotides to the 3’ end of a growing RNA strand. In the EC system of classification, the accepted name for RNA polymerase is DNA-directed RNA polymerase.

==Classification==
Described primarily based on the type of biochemical group transferred, transferases can be divided into ten categories (based on the EC Number classification). These categories comprise over 450 different unique enzymes. In the EC numbering system, transferases have been given a classification of EC2. Hydrogen is not considered a functional group when it comes to transferase targets; instead, hydrogen transfer is included under oxidoreductases, due to electron transfer considerations.

==Role==

===EC 2.1: single carbon transferases===

EC 2.1 includes enzymes that transfer single-carbon groups. This category consists of transfers of methyl, hydroxymethyl, formyl, carboxy, carbamoyl, and amido groups. Carbamoyltransferases, as an example, transfer a carbamoyl group from one molecule to another. Carbamoyl groups follow the formula NH2CO. In ATCase such a transfer is written as carbamoyl phosphate + L-aspartate formula_3 L-carbamoyl aspartate + phosphate.

===EC 2.2: aldehyde and ketone transferases===

Enzymes that transfer aldehyde or ketone groups and included in EC 2.2. This category consists of various transketolases and transaldolases. Transaldolase, the namesake of aldehyde transferases, is an important part of the pentose phosphate pathway. The reaction it catalyzes consists of a transfer of a dihydroxyacetone functional group to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (also known as G3P). The reaction is as follows: sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate formula_2 erythrose 4-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate.

===EC 2.3: acyl transferases===

Transfer of acyl groups or acyl groups that become alkyl groups during the process of being transferred are key aspects of EC 2.3. Further, this category also differentiates between amino-acyl and non-amino-acyl groups. Peptidyl transferase is a ribozyme that facilitates formation of peptide bonds during translation. As an aminoacyltransferase, it catalyzes the transfer of a peptide to an aminoacyl-tRNA, following this reaction: peptidyl-tRNAA + aminoacyl-tRNAB formula_2 tRNAA + peptidyl aminoacyl-tRNAB.

===EC 2.4: glycosyl, hexosyl, and pentosyl transferases===

EC 2.4 includes enzymes that transfer glycosyl groups, as well as those that transfer hexose and pentose. Glycosyltransferase is a subcategory of EC 2.4 transferases that is involved in biosynthesis of disaccharides and polysaccharides through transfer of monosaccharides to other molecules. An example of a prominent glycosyltransferase is lactose synthase which is a dimer possessing two protein subunits. Its primary action is to produce lactose from glucose and UDP-galactose. This occurs via the following pathway: UDP-β-D-galactose + D-glucose formula_2 UDP + lactose.

===EC 2.5: alkyl and aryl transferases===
EC 2.5 relates to enzymes that transfer alkyl or aryl groups, but does not include methyl groups. This is in contrast to functional groups that become alkyl groups when transferred, as those are included in EC 2.3. EC 2.5 currently only possesses one sub-class: Alkyl and aryl transferases. Cysteine synthase, for example, catalyzes the formation of acetic acids and cysteine from O3-acetyl-L-serine and hydrogen sulfide: O3-acetyl-L-serine + H2S formula_2 L-cysteine + acetate.

===EC 2.6: nitrogenous transferases===

The grouping consistent with transfer of nitrogenous groups is EC 2.6. This includes enzymes like transaminase (also known as &quot;aminotransferase&quot;), and a very small number of oximinotransferases and other nitrogen group transferring enzymes. EC 2.6 previously included amidinotransferase but it has since been reclassified as a subcategory of EC 2.1 (single-carbon transferring enzymes). In the case of aspartate transaminase, which can act on tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, it reversibly transfers an amino group from one molecule to the other.

The reaction, for example, follows the following order: L-aspartate +2-oxoglutarate formula_2 oxaloacetate + L-glutamate.

===EC 2.7: phosphorus transferases===

While EC 2.7 includes enzymes that transfer phosphorus-containing groups, it also includes nuclotidyl transferases as well. Sub-category phosphotransferase is divided up in categories based on the type of group that accepts the transfer. Groups that are classified as phosphate acceptors include: alcohols, carboxy groups, nitrogenous groups, and phosphate groups. Further constituents of this subclass of transferases are various kinases. A prominent kinase is cyclin-dependent kinase (or CDK), which comprises a sub-family of protein kinases. As their name implies, CDKs are heavily dependent on specific cyclin molecules for activation. Once combined, the CDK-cyclin complex is capable of enacting its function within the cell cycle.

The reaction catalyzed by CDK is as follows: ATP + a target protein formula_3 ADP + a phosphoprotein.

===EC 2.8: sulfur transferases===

Transfer of sulfur-containing groups is covered by EC 2.8 and is subdivided into the subcategories of sulfurtransferases, sulfotransferases, and CoA-transferases, as well as enzymes that transfer alkylthio groups. A specific group of sulfotransferases are those that use PAPS as a sulfate group donor. Within this group is alcohol sulfotransferase which has a broad targeting capacity. Due to this, alcohol sulfotransferase is also known by several other names including &quot;hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase,&quot; &quot;steroid sulfokinase,&quot; and &quot;estrogen sulfotransferase.&quot; Decreases in its activity has been linked to human liver disease. This transferase acts via the following reaction: 3&#x27;-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + an alcohol formula_2 adenosine 3&#x27;,5&#x27;bisphosphate + an alkyl sulfate.

===EC 2.9: selenium transferases===

EC 2.9 includes enzymes that transfer selenium-containing groups. This category only contains two transferases, and thus is one of the smallest categories of transferase. Selenocysteine synthase, which was first added to the classification system in 1999, converts seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA) into selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec UCA).

===EC 2.10: metal transferases===

The category of EC 2.10 includes enzymes that transfer molybdenum or tungsten-containing groups. However, as of 2011, only one enzyme has been added: molybdopterin molybdotransferase. This enzyme is a component of MoCo biosynthesis in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. The reaction it catalyzes is as follows: adenylyl-molybdopterin + molybdate formula_3 molybdenum cofactor + AMP.

==Role in histo-blood group==
The A and B transferases are the foundation of the human ABO blood group system. Both A and B transferases are glycosyltransferases, meaning they transfer a sugar molecule onto an H-antigen. This allows H-antigen to synthesize the glycoprotein and glycolipid conjugates that are known as the A/B antigens. The full name of A transferase is alpha 1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and its function in the cell is to add N-acetylgalactosamine to H-antigen, creating A-antigen. The full name of B transferase is alpha 1-3-galactosyltransferase, and its function in the cell is to add a galactose molecule to H-antigen, creating B-antigen.

It is possible for &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; to have any of four different blood types: Type A (express A antigens), Type B (express B antigens), Type AB (express both A and B antigens) and Type O (express neither A nor B antigens). The gene for A and B transferases is located on chromosome 9. The gene contains seven exons and six introns and the gene itself is over 18kb long. The alleles for A and B transferases are extremely similar. The resulting enzymes only differ in 4 amino acid residues. The differing residues are located at positions 176, 235, 266, and 268 in the enzymes.

==Deficiencies==
Transferase deficiencies are at the root of many common illnesses. The most common result of a transferase deficiency is a buildup of a cellular product.

===SCOT deficiency===
Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase deficiency (or SCOT deficiency) leads to a buildup of ketones.
Ketones are created upon the breakdown of fats in the body and are an important energy source. Inability to utilize ketones leads to intermittent ketoacidosis, which usually first manifests during infancy. Disease sufferers experience nausea, vomiting, inability to feed, and breathing difficulties. In extreme cases, ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death. The deficiency is caused by mutation in the gene OXCT1. Treatments mostly rely on controlling the diet of the patient.

===CPT-II deficiency===
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency (also known as CPT-II deficiency) leads to an excess long chain fatty acids, as the body lacks the ability to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria to be processed as a fuel source. The disease is caused by a defect in the gene CPT2. This deficiency will present in patients in one of three ways: lethal neonatal, severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular, and myopathic form. The myopathic is the least severe form of the deficiency and can manifest at any point in the lifespan of the patient. The other two forms appear in infancy. Common symptoms of the lethal neonatal form and the severe infantile forms are liver failure, heart problems, seizures and death. The myopathic form is characterized by muscle pain and weakness following vigorous exercise. Treatment generally includes dietary modifications and carnitine supplements.

===Galactosemia===
Galactosemia results from an inability to process galactose, a simple sugar. This deficiency occurs when the gene for galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) has any number of mutations, leading to a deficiency in the amount of GALT produced. There are two forms of Galactosemia: classic and Duarte. Duarte galactosemia is generally less severe than classic galactosemia and is caused by a deficiency of galactokinase. Galactosemia renders infants unable to process the sugars in breast milk, which leads to vomiting and anorexia within days of birth. Most symptoms of the disease are caused by a buildup of galactose-1-phosphate in the body. Common symptoms include liver failure, sepsis, failure to grow, and mental impairment, among others. Buildup of a second toxic substance, galactitol, occurs in the lenses of the eyes, causing cataracts. Currently, the only available treatment is early diagnosis followed by adherence to a diet devoid of lactose, and prescription of antibiotics for infections that may develop.

===Choline acetyltransferase deficiencies===
Choline acetyltransferase (also known as ChAT or CAT) is an important enzyme which produces the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is involved in many neuropsychic functions such as memory, attention, sleep and arousal. 
The enzyme is globular in shape and consists of a single amino acid chain. ChAT functions to transfer an acetyl group from acetyl co-enzyme A to choline in the synapses of nerve cells and exists in two forms: soluble and membrane bound. The ChAT gene is located on chromosome 10.

====Alzheimer&#x27;s disease====
Decreased expression of ChAT is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease show a 30 to 90% reduction in activity in several regions of the brain, including the temporal lobe, the parietal lobe and the frontal lobe. However, ChAT deficiency is not believed to be the main cause of this disease.

====Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease)====
Patients with ALS show a marked decrease in ChAT activity in motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Low levels of ChAT activity are an early indication of the disease and are detectable long before motor neurons begin to die. This can even be detected before the patient is symptomatic.

====Huntington&#x27;s disease====
Patients with Huntington&#x27;s also show a marked decrease in ChAT production. Though the specific cause of the reduced production is not clear, it is believed that the death of medium-sized motor neurons with spiny dendrites leads to the lower levels of ChAT production.

====Schizophrenia====
Patients with Schizophrenia also exhibit decreased levels of ChAT, localized to the mesopontine tegment of the brain and the nucleus accumbens, which is believed to correlate with the decreased cognitive functioning experienced by these patients.

====Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)====
Recent studies have shown that SIDS infants show decreased levels of ChAT in both the hypothalamus and the striatum. SIDS infants also display fewer neurons capable of producing ChAT in the vagus system. These defects in the medulla could lead to an inability to control essential autonomic functions such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

====Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS)====
CMS is a family of diseases that are characterized by defects in neuromuscular transmission which leads to recurrent bouts of apnea (inability to breathe) that can be fatal. ChAT deficiency is implicated in myasthenia syndromes where the transition problem occurs presynaptically. These syndromes are characterized by the patients’ inability to resynthesize acetylcholine.

==Uses in biotechnology==

===Terminal transferases===
Terminal transferases are transferases that can be used to label DNA or to produce plasmid vectors. It accomplishes both of these tasks by adding deoxynucleotides in the form of a template to the downstream end or 3&#x27; end of an existing DNA molecule.
Terminal transferase is one of the few DNA polymerases that can function without an RNA primer.

===Glutathione transferases===
The family of glutathione transferases (GST) is extremely diverse, and therefore can be used for a number of biotechnological purposes. Plants use glutathione transferases as a means to segregate toxic metals from the rest of the cell. These glutathione transferases can be used to create biosensors to detect contaminants such as herbicides and insecticides. Glutathione transferases are also used in transgenic plants to increase resistance to both biotic and abiotic stress. Glutathione transferases are currently being explored as targets for anti-cancer medications due to their role in drug resistance. Further, glutathione transferase genes have been investigated due to their ability to prevent oxidative damage and have shown improved resistance in transgenic cultigens.

===Rubber transferases===
Currently the only available commercial source of natural rubber is the &quot;Hevea&quot; plant (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;). Natural rubber is superior to synthetic rubber in a number of commercial uses. Efforts are being made to produce transgenic plants capable of synthesizing natural rubber, including tobacco and sunflower. These efforts are focused on sequencing the subunits of the rubber transferase enzyme complex in order to transfect these genes into other plants.

==Membrane-associated transferases==
Many transferases associate with biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or anchored to membranes through a single transmembrane helix, for example numerous glycosyltransferases in Golgi apparatus. Some others are multi-span transmembrane proteins, for example certain oligosaccharyltransferases or microsomal glutathione S-transferase from MAPEG family.

<doc id="548014" wikidata="Q3315758" url="?curid=548014" title="Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland">
<text>Charles Palmer, later Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland, 1st Duke of Southampton Chief Butler of England (18 June 1662 – 9 September 1730), styled Baron Limerick before 1670; Earl of Southampton between 1670 and 1675; and known as the Duke of Southampton from 1675 until 1709, when he succeeded his mother as Duke of Cleveland.

==Early life==
Charles Palmer, later &quot;FitzRoy&quot;, was born on 18 June 1662, and was initially claimed by Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine, his mother&#x27;s husband, as his son and heir before being publicly acknowledged and invested by King Charles II of England as his son.

He was the third eldest of the illegitimate sons of Charles II, with his mother being Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine and later 1st Duchess of Cleveland, then the wife of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine. In recognition of his legal father the Earl of Castlemaine, he was styled from birth by the courtesy title &quot;Lord Limerick&quot;, one of the Earl&#x27;s lesser titles. His birth marked the separation of his legal parents; Lord Castlemaine, a Roman Catholic, had him christened in the Roman Catholic faith, but six days later, the King had him re-christened in the Church of England as an Anglican and Protestant.

==Personal life==
In 1670, at the age of 8, he was betrothed to Mary Wood, only child and sole heiress of Sir Henry Wood, 1st Baronet, Clerk of the Green Cloth, but with the proviso that the marriage be delayed until Mary was 16 years old. Following the death of her father, the Duchess of Cleveland more or less abducted Mary, with the intention of bringing her up with her own children. In 1675, he was created Duke of Southampton by King Charles II, along with the subsidiary titles of Earl of Chichester and Baron Newbury. The marriage to Mary Wood took place in 1679, but within months the new Duchess had died of smallpox, leaving no children of the marriage.

In 1694, the Duke remarried Anne Pulteney, a daughter of Sir William Pulteney, of Misterton, Leicestershire, and had issue:
*Lady Grace FitzRoy, Countess of Darlington, born 28 March 1697, married in 1725 Henry Vane, Earl of Darlington. Their grandson later became William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland.
*William FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Cleveland and 2nd Duke of Southampton (19 February 1698 – 18 May 1774) no issue, the title went extinct.
*Lord Charles Fitzroy (13 February 1698 – 31 July 1723)
*Lord Henry Fitzroy (17 August 1701 – 1709)
*Lady Anne FitzRoy, (12 November 1702 - 13 February 1769), married John Paddey, Esq.
*Lady Barbara FitzRoy, died unmarried

On the death of his mother in 1709, the Duke became also second Duke of Cleveland, by a special remainder in the grant of the dukedom which set aside his illegitimacy.

He died on 9 September 1730 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his eldest son William FitzRoy (1698–1774), who died without issue, when all his titles became extinct.

<doc id="548015" wikidata="Q6601886" url="?curid=548015" title="List of United States Navy enlisted rates">
<text>In the United States Navy, a &quot;rate&quot; is the military rank of an enlisted sailor, indicating where the sailor stands within the chain of command, and also defining one&#x27;s pay grade. However, in the U.S. Navy, only officers carry the term &quot;rank&quot;, while it is proper to refer to an enlisted sailor&#x27;s pay grade as &quot;rate.&quot; This is not to be confused with the term &quot;rating&quot;, which refers to one&#x27;s area of occupational specialization within the enlisted Navy (see below and also List of United States Navy ratings ). Associated with the enlisted pay grades is a numbering system from the most junior enlisted sailor (&quot;E-1&quot;) to the most senior enlisted sailor (&quot;E-9&quot;). This enlisted numbering system is the same across all six branches of the U.S. military. All E-1s through E-3s are known as seaman, fireman, airman, constructionman, or hospitalman. E-4 through E-6 are called petty officers. All E-7s are called chief petty officer, E-8s senior chief petty officer, and E-9s master chief petty officer. Rates are displayed on a rating badge, which is a combination of rate and rating. E-2s and E-3s have color-coded group rate marks based on their career field. Personnel in pay grade E-1, since 1996, do not have an insignia to wear.

Ratings are earned through &quot;A&quot; schools, which are attended before deployment and after undergoing initial basic training at Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois, or (less commonly) by &quot;striking&quot; for a rating through on-the-job training (OJT) in the Fleet. Some sailors may undergo additional training in a &quot;C&quot; school either before or after a tour of duty. Upon completion, they are assigned a four-digit Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) code, which identifies a specific skill within their standard rating. This defines what jobs they are qualified to do. For example, some billets might not only require a hospital corpsman first class, but might specify that they have NEC 8402 (Submarine Force Independent Duty), NEC 8403 (Fleet Marine Forces Reconnaissance Independent Duty Corpsman), or any other of several NECs depending upon the billet&#x27;s requirements.

==History==
On 29 September 2016, the United States Navy discontinued enlisted ratings after 241 years of use in an effort to modernize the classification system. Naval sailors were thereafter to be referred to solely by their rank and would hold a Navy Operations Specialty (NOS) instead of a rating. The rating symbols depicted for each rating badge listed below (except for the rating badge of a command master chief) is boatswain&#x27;s mate. However, the decision was reversed and the rating system was restored in December 2016.

==E-1 to E-3==
Sailors in pay grades E-1 through E-3 are considered to be in apprenticeships while searching or in training for a career path.
They are divided into five definable groups or job communities, with colored group rate marks designating the group to which they belong: seaman, fireman, airman, constructionman, and Hospitalman. One of three apprentice devices may be worn above the rank insignia, which denotes the sailor is an apprentice in a particular field and is in search of a rating to join. Sailors who have gone directly to a base, station, or ship without any specialized training are eligible to select a career field, and through correspondence courses and extensive on-the-job training, may qualify for a rating. This process is called &quot;striking for a rating&quot;. If a sailor has qualified for a rate, but has not yet become a petty officer, they are called a designated striker, and are identified by a striker&#x27;s badge that displays the sailor&#x27;s rating, along with their group rate marks. The service member is addressed by one&#x27;s group designation, if known (e.g., Fireman Jones, Constructionman Apprentice Smith); by the generic appellation &quot;seaman&quot;; or by one&#x27;s striker designation (Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Seaman Watson, Culinary Specialist Seaman Recruit Johnson). Those who have completed the &quot;A&quot; school for Hospital Corpsman wear their Caduceus above their stripes and substitute the word &quot;Hospitalman&quot; for &quot;Seaman&quot; in their rating titles.

In the September 2016 rating change, it was announced that only the &quot;seaman&quot; group would remain as the rate title for E-1, E-2, and E-3, with the others being retired. However, the Navy reversed this new policy three months later and reinstated the traditional rating system.
==E-4 to E-6==

E-4 to E-6 are non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and are specifically called petty officers in the Navy. Petty officers perform not only the duties of their specific career field but also serve as leaders to junior enlisted personnel. They must take responsibility for their subordinates, address grievances, inform the chain of command on matters pertaining to good order and discipline, and may even have to place personnel on report. The title petty officer comes from the French word &quot;petit&quot;, meaning something small. In medieval England, villages had several &quot;petite&quot; or &quot;petty&quot; officers who were subordinate to major officials. Thus, petty officers are assistants to senior officers.

Petty officers have been an important part of the U.S. Navy since its beginning. They were originally appointed by the ship&#x27;s captain and usually held such appointments while serving under the captain who selected them. The petty officers of this time did not have uniforms or a rank insignia. In 1841 a rate badge was assigned, consisting of a sleeve device displaying an eagle perched on an anchor. Rating marks did not appear until 1866.

From 1885 to 1894, the Navy recognized three classes of petty officers who were authorized to wear a &quot;rate&quot; (rank) insignia consisting of chevrons pointing down under a spread eagle and a rating mark. Unlike the current rate badge, the eagle faced right instead of left. The current insignia for petty officers came about in 1894, and is a perched eagle with spread wings (usually referred to as a &quot;crow&quot;, due to its black color on white uniforms and the former light blue working uniforms) above a rating mark, with chevrons denoting their rate below. Initially, the eagle faced left or right on the rating emblem depending on which sleeve the badge was worn. &quot;Seafarer&quot; rates, such as boatswain or gunner, are unique to service aboard a ship, and were worn on the right sleeve; the eagle on these insignia faced right, so that they would be facing forward on the wearer. Other rates, such as administration or medical positions, were worn on the left sleeve, so the eagle on those insignia faced left, so that they would be facing forward on the wearer. In 1948, the Navy standardized all ratings to be worn on the left sleeve.

The authority to wear gold rating badges and service stripes on the dress blue uniform is granted when a sailor completes twelve consecutive years of service. Prior to June 2019, those years had to have been without any official record of bad conduct due to punitive action via non-judicial punishment or courts martial. During that time, the gold rating badges and service stripes were treated distinctly from the Good Conduct Medal, which was and is awarded for three consecutive years of &quot;honorable service&quot;, defined as being free of disciplinary infractions.

Coloration of the insignia for E-4 through E-9 depends upon the uniform worn. Black cloth with red or gold embroidered stripes is used on the winter uniforms, while white cloth with black embroidered stripes is used on the summer uniforms, depending on whether or not they have less or more than 12 years of service, respectively. 

==E-7 to E-9==
E-7 to E-9 are senior non-commissioned officers and are considered a separate community within the Navy. They have separate berthing and dining facilities (where feasible), wear separate uniforms, and perform separate duties. Advancement to chief petty officer (E-7) or above requires a board review by existing master chief petty officers beyond the normal examination score and performance evaluation process. The annual list of chief petty officer selectees is authorized by Congress.

The proper form of address to a chief petty officer is &quot;Chief&quot;, &quot;Senior chief&quot; (or &quot;Senior&quot;), or &quot;Master chief&quot; according to their rate. In the U.S. Navy, chief petty officers are specifically tasked, in writing, with the duty of training junior officers (ensign, lieutenant (j.g.), and lieutenant).(Previous citation no longer valid.)

Although the title &quot;chief&quot; has been around since the Continental Navy in 1776, the chief petty officer rate was not established until 1 April 1893. At that time nearly all sailors who had carried the rate of petty officer first class since 1885 were advanced to chief petty officer, with the exception of schoolmasters, ship&#x27;s writers, and carpenter&#x27;s mates.

The rates senior chief petty officer and master chief petty officer were established on 1 June 1958. To be eligible for advancement to senior chief petty officer, a chief petty officer must have had three years in the current grade. For advancement to master chief, a senior chief must have a total of three years in the current grade.

The dress blue insignia consists of a perched eagle (or &quot;crow&quot;) with spread wings atop a rating mark, with three chevrons and one &quot;rocker&quot; above the rating mark. Inverted five-point stars above the crow denote the rank of senior chief (one star) or master chief (two stars). All other uniforms use the collar device to denote rank. It consists of a foul anchor with the initials U S N in silver, superimposed, with stars above the anchor to indicate higher pay grades, similar to the dress blue insignia.

===Command senior chief===
On 30 July 2015, the Navy formally established the rating of command senior chief (CMDCS); before then from 2005 to 2015 it had been a billet instead of a rating. They typically serve at smaller commands that do not have a command master chief billet (CMDCM). A command senior chief career path feeds directly into the command master chief program, and is a permanent rank, unlike their U.S. Air Force first sergeant, E-8 paygrade counterparts.

=== Command master chief ===
A command master chief is considered to be the senior-most enlisted service member within a command, and is the special assistant to the commanding officer in all matters pertaining to the health, welfare, job satisfaction, morale, utilization, advancement and training of the command&#x27;s enlisted personnel. Command master chiefs can be Command level (within a single unit, such as a ship or shore station), Fleet level (squadrons consisting of multiple operational units, headed by a flag officer or commodore), or Force level (consisting of a separate community within the Navy, such as Subsurface, Air, Reserves). After attaining the rate of master chief petty officer, a sailor may choose to further their career by becoming a command master chief petty officer. 

Both command senior chief and command master chief existed as a position before being authorized as separate rates/rank. For example, there could be a senior chief boatswain&#x27;s mate acting as command senior chief or a master chief personnelman who acts as the command master chief.

The command master chief rate insignia are similar to the insignia for master chief, except that the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (e.g. MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for command master chief are silver, while stars for fleet or force master chief are gold. Additionally, command master chiefs, wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket (for males) or above the nametag (for females), denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).

=== Fleet master chief and force master chief ===
Fleet and force master chiefs are appointed by the commander of a fleet or a force command, to serve as their senior enlisted adviser. They have virtually the same responsibilities as command master chiefs, but for larger fleet or force commands rather than a single unit. These two ranks are equivalent and their insignia is also the same—a master chief rating badge with two gold stars above the eagle and a gold star for the rating insignia. 

===Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy===
The Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) is the senior enlisted person in the Navy, appointed by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) to serve as a spokesperson to address the issues of enlisted personnel to the highest positions in the Navy. The MCPON is the senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of Naval Operations and Chief of Naval Personnel. Exact duties vary, depending on the CNO, though the duties generally include traveling throughout the Navy, observing training and talking to sailors and their families. The MCPON serves on several boards concerned with enlisted members, represents the Department of the Navy at special events, and may be called upon to testify before Congress regarding enlisted personnel issues.

The position was originally established as &quot;Senior Enlisted Advisor of the Navy&quot; in January 1967 in response to a recommendation from the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s task force on Navy personnel retention. Three months later, the title was officially changed to &quot;Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy&quot;. The individual rating specialty marks for the MCPON was replaced by an inverted star in 1971.

The MCPON&#x27;s current insignia is similar to that of Fleet, Force, or CMDCMs, with the addition of a third star above the perched eagle or anchor.
===Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman===
The Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman (SEAC) is the senior enlisted person appointed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) to serve as a spokesperson to address the issues of enlisted personnel to the highest positions in the Department of Defense. The SEAC can be chosen from any one of the five military services and is considered the most senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) position overall in the United States Armed Forces.

The position was first established in 2005 but was briefly discontinued in 2008 when then incoming chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, elected not to appoint anyone to the position. It was then reinstated by his successor in 2011 and has continued ever since.

To date there has been no SEAC chosen from the Navy but in 2019 each branch was tasked with creating a unique rank insignia for the SEAC. The Navy approved their version of the SEAC insignia by 2023.

<doc id="548018" wikidata="Q407479" url="?curid=548018" title="Oxidoreductase">
<text>In biochemistry, an oxidoreductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from one molecule, the reductant, also called the electron donor, to another, the oxidant, also called the electron acceptor. This group of enzymes usually utilizes NADP+ or NAD+ as cofactors. Transmembrane oxidoreductases create electron transport chains in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria, including respiratory complexes I, II and III. Some others can associate with biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or be anchored to the membranes through a single transmembrane helix.

== Reactions ==

For example, an enzyme that catalyzed this reaction would be an oxidoreductase:

:A– + B → A + B–

In this example, A is the reductant (electron donor) and B is the oxidant (electron acceptor).

In biochemical reactions, the redox reactions are sometimes more difficult to see, such as this reaction from glycolysis:

:Pi + glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + NAD+ → NADH + H+ + 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate

In this reaction, NAD+ is the oxidant (electron acceptor), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is the reductant (electron donor).

== Nomenclature ==

Proper names of oxidoreductases are formed as &quot;&quot;donor:acceptor&quot; oxidoreductase&quot;; however, other names are much more common.
* The common name is &quot;&quot;donor&quot; dehydrogenase&quot; when possible, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the second reaction above.
* Common names are also sometimes formed as &quot;&quot;acceptor&quot; reductase&quot;, such as NAD+ reductase.
* &quot;&quot;Donor&quot; oxidase&quot; is a special case where O2 is the acceptor.

==Classification==
Oxidoreductases are classified as EC 1 in the EC number classification of enzymes. Oxidoreductases can be further classified into 21 subclasses:
* EC 1.1 includes oxidoreductases that act on the CH-OH group of donors (alcohol oxidoreductases such as methanol dehydrogenase)
* EC 1.2 includes oxidoreductases that act on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors
* EC 1.3 includes oxidoreductases that act on the CH-CH group of donors (CH-CH oxidoreductases)
* EC 1.4 includes oxidoreductases that act on the CH-NH2 group of donors (Amino acid oxidoreductases, Monoamine oxidase)
* EC 1.5 includes oxidoreductases that act on CH-NH group of donors
* EC 1.6 includes oxidoreductases that act on NADH or NADPH
* EC 1.7 includes oxidoreductases that act on other nitrogenous compounds as donors
* EC 1.8 includes oxidoreductases that act on a sulfur group of donors
* EC 1.9 includes oxidoreductases that act on a heme group of donors
* EC 1.10 includes oxidoreductases that act on diphenols and related substances as donors
* EC 1.11 includes oxidoreductases that act on peroxide as an acceptor (peroxidases)
* EC 1.12 includes oxidoreductases that act on hydrogen as donors
* EC 1.13 includes oxidoreductases that act on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases)
* EC 1.14 includes oxidoreductases that act on paired donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen
* EC 1.15 includes oxidoreductases that act on superoxide radicals as acceptors
* EC 1.16 includes oxidoreductases that oxidize metal ions
* EC 1.17 includes oxidoreductases that act on CH or CH2 groups
* EC 1.18 includes oxidoreductases that act on iron-sulfur proteins as donors
* EC 1.19 includes oxidoreductases that act on reduced flavodoxin as a donor
* EC 1.20 includes oxidoreductases that act on phosphorus or arsenic in donors
* EC 1.21 includes oxidoreductases that act on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond

<doc id="548024" wikidata="Q1277453" url="?curid=548024" title="Earle Combs">
<text>Earle Bryan Combs (May 14, 1899 – July 21, 1976) was an American professional baseball player who played his entire career for the New York Yankees (1924–1935). Combs batted leadoff and played center field on the Yankees&#x27; fabled 1927 team (often referred to as Murderers&#x27; Row). He is one of six players on that team who have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame; the other five are Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, Tony Lazzeri, Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.

Combs led the league in triples three times and was among the top ten in the category in several other seasons. He suffered a fractured skull and other injuries from a crash into an outfield wall in 1934, then retired after another injury the next season. Nicknamed &quot;the Kentucky Colonel&quot;, Combs was known as a gentleman on and off the field. He remained in baseball as a coach for many years after his retirement as a player.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Combs was born in Pebworth, Owsley County, Kentucky. As a child, he played baseball games with tree limbs as bats and with baseballs made out of string and the material of old shoes.

===College===
Combs left Pebworth in 1917 to enter Eastern Kentucky State Normal School in Richmond. In those early days, Eastern prepared its students to become teachers. On completion of a two-year program, graduates were often employed in rural one-room schools. They were often responsible for forty or more students, ranging in age from six to teen-age in grades 1–8, so the work required much management skill.

In his first year at Eastern, Combs put on a stellar performance in a faculty-student baseball game and was encouraged to join the school team by Dr. Charles Keith (Dean of Men and baseball coach). He hit .591 at Eastern during his last season. After graduating from Eastern, Combs went back to his native Owsley County and taught in one-room schoolhouses in both Ida May and Levi.

===Early baseball career===

Combs continued to play baseball in his spare time. He played for High Splint (Harlan County coal company team) in the Pine Mountain League (summer of 1921) and hit .444. He also played semi-pro baseball for the Lexington, Kentucky based Lexington Reds of the Blue Grass League. It was in Lexington (in 1922) that Combs drew the attention of the Louisville Colonels of the American Association. After scouting him, Louisville offered him a contract which provided a salary that exceeded the $37 per month ($ today) he made as a teacher in Owsley County.

His Louisville debut was unsettling; he committed several outfield errors. The last one gave the opposition the two runs they needed to win the game. Distraught afterward, Combs said, &quot;As I went after the dropped ball I was tempted to keep right on going, climb the fence and not stop running until I got to Pebworth.&quot; He had married Ruth McCollum, his high school sweetheart, the year before and was concerned about his future.

Joe McCarthy, the manager of the Colonels and later his manager with the Yankees, knew what Combs could do and told him, &quot;Look, if I didn&#x27;t think you belonged in center field on this club I wouldn&#x27;t put you there, and I&#x27;m going to keep you there.&quot; Combs soon found his stride, hitting .344 in 1922 and .380 in 1923 for the Colonels and also earning a reputation for speedy ball-hawking in the outfield and reckless base- stealing on offense.

===Major league years===
In 1924, the New York Yankees won a spirited bidding war and bought Combs&#x27; contract for $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms). This was a rather large sum at that time, but it bore fruit for the Yankees as Combs proved an immediate success in New York. In his rookie season (summer of 1924), Combs played center field and hit .400 before breaking an ankle sliding into home plate at Cleveland&#x27;s League Park on June 15. Except for one pinch-hitting appearance, he saw no more action that rookie season.

The following year, manager Miller Huggins made Combs the Yankees&#x27; leadoff hitter. He held this position for the remaining eleven years of his playing career. He hit .342 and scored 117 runs in 1925. In his best year (1927), he hit .356 with 231 hits, 131 runs scored, 36 doubles and a league-leading 23 triples. He led the league in triples again the next year, batting .310 and finishing sixth in Most Valuable Player voting. He hit .345 in 1929, then .344 in 1930, again leading the league in triples.

Combs suffered a serious accident in July 1934. On a 100+-degree day at St. Louis&#x27; Sportsman&#x27;s Park, he crashed into the outfield wall going for a fly ball, sustaining a fractured skull, a broken shoulder and a damaged knee. He was reportedly near death for several days, and was hospitalized for more than two months. The next season, he attempted a comeback but suffered another serious injury. That injury, coupled with the knowledge that the Yankees were set to bring up a rookie center fielder named Joe DiMaggio the next season, led to Combs&#x27; decision to retire at the age of 36.

For his career Combs hit .325, had an on-base average of .397 and averaged nearly 200 hits, 75 walks and only 31 strikeouts a season. He was a part of three World Series championships (in 1927, 1928 and 1932). He also set the Yankees&#x27; team record for most triples in a season (23 in 1927). He hit no lower than .282 in any of his eleven seasons, and scored no fewer than 113 runs from 1925 through 1933. In four World Series, Combs hit .350 with a .443 on-base average. He averaged 17 triples a season, and had a lifetime fielding percentage seven points better than the league average.
 
Miller Huggins once said, &quot;If you had nine Combs&#x27; on your ball club, you could go to bed every night and sleep like a baby&quot;. Joe McCarthy (another longtime Yankee manager) said, &quot;They wouldn&#x27;t pay baseball managers much of a salary if they all presented as few problems as did Earle Combs.&quot; Said Babe Ruth: &quot;Combs was more than a good ballplayer; he was always a first-class gentleman.&quot; American sportswriter and baseball historian Fred Lieb wrote of Combs, &quot;If a vote were taken of the sportswriters as to who their favorite ballplayer on the Yankees would be, Combs would have been their choice.&quot;

After his retirement as a player, he remained in the game as a coach for almost two decades. He was offered a coaching job with the Yankees in 1936, and started his new position by instructing his replacement (DiMaggio) on the nuances of Yankee Stadium&#x27;s outfield. He coached for the Yankees through 1944, for the St. Louis Browns in 1947 and for the Boston Red Sox (1948–1952). When he announced his retirement from the Boston coaching staff in March 1953, he said that he was going to spend more time with family and his Kentucky farm. He returned to coaching for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1954.

===Life after baseball===
After retiring from baseball in 1954, Combs returned to his 400-acre farm in Madison County. He served as the Kentucky state banking commissioner during Governor (and former Baseball Commissioner) A. B. &#x27;Happy&#x27; Chandler&#x27;s second administration (1955–1959), and on Eastern&#x27;s Board of Regents (1959–1975). In November 1962, he laid the foundation stone for Earle B. Combs Hall, a dormitory at Eastern. In June 1970, the Little League field at Irvine-McDowell Park in Richmond was named in his honor. In 2006, he was inducted as a charter member of Eastern&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame, and the university provides an athletic scholarship in his honor each year.

Combs was selected for induction into the Hall of Fame in 1970 by the Veterans Committee. When he learned of the honor, he said &quot;I thought the Hall of Fame was for superstars, not just average players like me.&quot; Sabermetrician Bill James has listed Combs as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor.

Combs and his wife Ruth (1901–1989) had three sons, Earle Jr, Charles and Donald. After a long illness, he died on July 21, 1976 (age 77) in Richmond, Kentucky. He is interred in the Richmond Cemetery.

===Career statistics===

In four World Series covering 16 games (1926, 1927, 1928 and 1932), Combs batted .350 (21-for-60) with 17 runs, three doubles, one home run, 9 runs batted in, and 10 base on balls.

<doc id="548037" wikidata="Q267971" url="?curid=548037" title="Fontana del Tritone, Rome">
<text>Fontana del Tritone (&quot;Triton Fountain&quot;) is a seventeenth-century fountain in Rome, by the Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Commissioned by his patron, Pope Urban VIII, the fountain is located in the Piazza Barberini, near the entrance to the Palazzo Barberini (which now houses the Galleria Nazionale d&#x27;Arte Antica) that Bernini helped to design and construct for the Barberini, Urban&#x27;s family. This fountain should be distinguished from the nearby &quot;Fontana dei Tritoni&quot; (Fountain of the Tritons) by Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri in Piazza Bocca della Verità which features two Tritons.

==Description==

The fountain was executed in travertine in 1642–43. Pope Urban VIII wanted a public ornament for the city and also a utility service to place in the center of the square dominated by his family&#x27;s brand-new palace. At its centre rises a larger than lifesize muscular Triton, a minor sea god of ancient Greco-Roman legend, depicted as a merman kneeling on a large shell, from which the Triton rises. His head is thrown back and his arms raise a conch to his lips; from it a jet of water spurts, formerly rising dramatically higher than it does today. The fountain has a base of four dolphins that entwine the papal tiara with crossed keys and the heraldic Barberini bees in their scaly tails.

The &quot;Tritone&quot;, the first of Bernini&#x27;s free-standing urban fountains, was erected to provide water from the Acqua Felice aqueduct which Urban had restored. It was Bernini&#x27;s last major commission from his great patron who died in 1644. At the Triton Fountain, Urban and Bernini brought the idea of a sculptural fountain, familiar from villa gardens, decisively to a public urban setting for the first time; previous public fountains in the city of Rome had been passive basins for the reception of public water.

Bernini has represented the triton to illustrate the triumphant passage from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; book I, evoking godlike control over the waters and describing the draining away of the Universal Deluge. The passage that Urban set Bernini to illustrate, was well known to all literate Roman contemporaries:

:&quot;Already Triton, at his call, appears&quot;
:&quot;Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears;&quot;
:&quot;And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears.&quot;
:&quot;The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,&quot;
:&quot;And give the waves the signal to retire.&quot;
:&quot;His writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent&quot;
:&quot;Grows by degrees into a large extent,&quot;
:&quot;Then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound,&quot;
:&quot;Runs the wide circuit of the world around:&quot;
:&quot;The sun first heard it, in his early east,&quot;
:&quot;And met the rattling echoes in the west.&quot;
:&quot;The waters, list&#x27;ning to the trumpet&#x27;s roar,&quot;
:&quot;Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.&quot;
:::—free translation by Sir Samuel Garth, John Dryden, et al..

The following year, Bernini sculpted the Fontana delle Api (Fountain of the Bees), a watering trough where the Via Veneto enters the Piazza Barberini. Both fountains were constructed around the time of the First War of Castro. Matthew K. Averett sees a political statement in their construction: as Urban restoring peace after an unfortunate but necessary conflict.

==Subsequent history==

The Triton Fountain is one of those evoked in Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Fontane di Roma&quot;. The legend applied to Trevi Fountain has been extended to this: that any visitor who throws a coin into the water (while facing away from the fountain) will have guaranteed their return to Rome.

The setting of the Piazza Barberini has changed significantly since the seventeenth century. Engravings of the time and photographs from the nineteenth century show much lower buildings around the piazza, which would have made the fountain much more dramatic. However, it is a tribute to the artistic judgement of Bernini that even now, with tall buildings around the traffic-ridden piazza, the Triton Fountain can still maintain a dramatic presence.

<doc id="548043" wikidata="Q7715767" url="?curid=548043" title="The Basin, Victoria">
<text>The Basin is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 31 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox local government area. The Basin recorded a population of 4,497 at the 2021 census.

==History==
===Traditional custodians===
Prior to European settlement, The Basin and surrounding suburbs were often visited by the Bunurong and Yarra Yarra people—hunting in the summer months in the Dandenong Ranges and its foothills. The Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation are the acknowledged traditional custodians of the land on which The Basin and all of City of Knox is located (source: City of Knox publication).

===Origin of the name===
The Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller named the area The Basin about 1860 during a visit to the Dandenong Ranges because it is located in a &quot;basin&quot; surrounded by hills. (source: Knox Historical Society) &quot;The Basin&quot; is shown on an 1868 survey plan, when settlers had taken licences or made freehold purchases of the land.

===Early European settlers===
William Peverill Watson is recorded as being the first official occupier of land in the area now known as The Basin in 1867. David Dobson arrived in Melbourne in 1854 and settled at The Basin as early as 1870 on land that extended from what is now Wicks Reserve through to Pavitt Lane bordered by Sheffield Road, Mountain Highway and Liverpool Road. David Dobson was instrumental in the establishment of The Basin Primary School. The Dobson family still occupies 60 acres of that original land.

Other significant early European settlers included the Chandler family. William Chandler was a market gardener who arrived in Victoria in 1854 and eventually settled in The Basin in 1873. He was the first in the area to crossbreed seeds and produce exceptional flowers and vegetables. William and Kate Chandler planted an acorn soon after they settled in The Basin—the English Oak still stands (source—historical marker). Two of William Chandler&#x27;s sons established plant nurseries in the area and his grandson, Sir Gilbert Chandler was a horticulturalist and Fern Tree Gully Shire President (1938–39) who later went on to be a member of State Parliament.

Notable settlers included J.J. Miller, book-maker and publisher of Miller&#x27;s Racing Guide. In 1872, Miller acquired land at The Basin in 1872 and invested considerable time and money building up a stud farm for racing horses, at one stage owning over in The Basin. To encourage summer tourists to visit and see the stables, training facilities and horses, Miller ran a private coach service from Forest Road in The Basin to Bayswater Railway Station. He also helped publicise the district with a gigantic fireworks display each Christmas. Miller was prominent in local affairs and was the first President of the new Shire of Fern Tree Gully. In 1888, Miller was the first in the area to secure a wine licence at his home. Miller faced financial ruin in the 1890s when the sweepstakes were declared illegal and he had to give up his property at The Basin. The home remains as a significant local historical building. 

The Basin Post Office opened around 1902.

==Government==

Residents are represented in the Victorian Parliament (Legislative Assembly) by the member for the electorate of Bayswater and in the Federal Parliament (House of Representatives) by the member for the electorate of Aston.

==Media==

The Boronia and The Basin Community Newspaper (BBCN) is produced and distributed each month by local volunteers. It focuses on local stories and history, including feature articles on immigrants&#x27; stories and local businesses.

==Parks and gardens==

The Basin forms one of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;green wedges&quot; and is nestled into the forest covered foothills of Mount Dandenong and the Dandenong Ranges National Park, including Doongalla Forest. This was formerly part of the Doongalla Estate, purchased by Sir Matthew Davies in 1891. The residential development of the suburb includes bushy parks such as Wicks Reserve and some farmland.

A significant natural resource is an operating farm that is owned and operated by the Salvation Army and includes a community church. The farm was purchased by the Salvation Army from David Dobson and others in 1897. In the same year a boys&#x27; home was established on the purchased land, in response to a government request for church groups to support boys who commit criminal offences. The home was originally named &quot;The Eden&quot;. At its height, it provided for 110 boys (source: historical marker). The Salvation Army&#x27;s site on Basin Olinda Road, The Basin is used for school camps, conferences and functions.

Important buildings include the Progress Hall and Elderly Citizens Hall. Both are located within &quot;The Basin Triangle&quot;, which also includes a Scouts hall, The Basin Fire Brigade (CFA) facility, a children&#x27;s playground and open space.

==Transport==

Mountain Highway runs through The Basin to Sassafras. It is a challenging and popular cycling route for people in Melbourne.

The Basin-Olinda Road is a mostly unsealed road that leads to the mountain town of Olinda.

Bus route 755 runs from The Basin to local train stations at Bayswater, Boronia and Ferntree Gully.

==Education==

The suburb has three primary schools:
* The Basin Primary School. The original school building is used today to house the administration offices of the school. 
* St Bernadette&#x27;s Catholic Primary school. The school opened on Wednesday 2 February 1983. The land had been purchased many years earlier in anticipation of the need for a Catholic School. 

There are two pre-schools—The Basin Pre-school (Forest Road) and Goodwin Estate pre-school (Rome Beauty Avenue)

==Retail==

There are various shops and restaurants fronting two sides of The Basin Triangle, amidst a village atmosphere. Retail outlets include a gym, a licensed post office, two pubs, cafés, liquor store, greengrocer, jeweller, butcher, financial advisor, wine bar/restaurant, bookstore, dog training gear, nursery/gift shop, hairdressing salons, fish and chips and tattoo shop/gallery.

==Culture and community==

The Basin Theatre Group is a local amateur theatre group that has operated since the first gathering of friends by Edna Chandler in 1954. Early productions were first conducted in the Basin Progress Hall. In 1962 the group constructed an A-frame barn that became known as The Hut. Later in 1973, the group constructed a larger theatre on land donated by Edna and Fergus Chandler. The group conducts four productions per year that include a range of performances in all theatrical styles. The Basin Theatre Group&#x27;s mission is to provide a variety of theatrical productions that are high quality and affordable, and at times, extraordinary and inspiring. Details of productions and booking information can be found on The Basin Theatre Website.

Local groups include the Country Fire Authority and The 1st Basin Scout Group.

The inaugural The Basin Music Festival was held in March 2005 and is held annually every March. Details of musicians and tickets can be found at The Basin Music Festival website.

Places of Worship in The Basin include the Romanian Seventh-day Adventist Church, St Bernadette&#x27;s Catholic Mass Centre (part of the primary school) and Vinayagar Hindu Temple.

==Sport==

The town has two tennis clubs; Miller Park Tennis Club and Batterham Park Tennis Club, and Australian Rules football team, The Basin Bears, competing in the Eastern Football League.

<doc id="548048" wikidata="Q585947" url="?curid=548048" title="Laon Cathedral">
<text>Laon Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic church located in Laon, Aisne, Hauts-de-France, France. Built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it is one of the most important and stylistically unified examples of early Gothic architecture. The church served as the cathedral of the Diocese of Laon until 1802, and has been recognized as a &quot;monument historique&quot; since 1840.

==History==
===Early history===
The Diocese of Laon was established by archbishop Remigius of Reims at the end of the fifth century. Presumably, an early church was erected soon afterward. Laon soon became one of the principal towns of the Frankish Empire.

A later church building, dating from the tenth or eleventh centuries, was torched during the Easter Insurrection on 25 April 1112. The merchants and bourgeoisie of Laon had procured a communal charter, which was soon revoked by Bishop Gaudry. The commune revolted, murdering the bishop. The episcopal palace was set alight; the fire soon spread to the cathedral. Afterward, the peasant population took the opportunity to pillage the town. Three months after the insurrection, members of the clergy at Laon toured France and England with relics belonging to the bishopric. Using funds raised from the tour, the church was reconstructed and consecrated on August 20, 1114, under Barthélemy de Jur.

However, as the population of Laon grew, it soon became clear that a larger cathedral was necessary. Laon&#x27;s economy was booming, and Anselm of Laon&#x27;s school of theology and exegesis was becoming one of the most acclaimed in Europe. Additionally, Laon&#x27;s communal charter was reestablished in 1130. By the late 1150s, construction on the current cathedral had begun under Gautier de Mortagne; it was essentially completed by 1230.

===Current building===
The present Laon Cathedral dates from the 12th and early 13th centuries, an early example of the Gothic style that originated in northern France. It was built half a century after the erection of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which originated the Gothic style. Construction on Laon Cathedral began with the choir and portions of both transepts between approximately 1160 and 1170. By 1180, the transept arms were finished and the eastern portion of the nave was erected. In the next phase of construction, lasting until the end of the century, the nave and most of the massive western facade were completed. Shortly after, the Chapel des Fonts, cloister, and chapter house were built onto the south side of the nave. Next, spurred by the donation of a local quarry in 1205, the original choir was dismantled and the current, larger choir was constructed by 1220. Soon after, the treasury and sacristy were built at the junctures of the choir and transepts, along with a large chapel extending from the southeastern end of the choir. Over the century, additional chapels were built off the aisles of the nave and the choir. Finally, the south transept&#x27;s facade was remodeled in the early fourteenth century, resulting in the current twin doors and tracery window.

===Later history===
Laon lost its status as a bishopric during the French Revolution. Following the Concordat of 1802, the building has functioned as a parish church under the Diocese of Soissons.

The cathedral was modified extensively during the nineteenth century. The tower foundations were rebuilt with masonry to prevent them from collapsing. The flying buttresses attached to the nave and transepts were rebuilt to match those bracing the choir. An ornate but structurally artificial upper extension of the cathedral&#x27;s front facade of unknown date was removed; it was replaced by a balustrade and the current Madonna and Child statue. Open doorways that historically had pierced the walls between the west entry portals were blocked in. Most notably, many of the medieval sculptural programs on the western facade were heavily altered.

By this time, fissures had appeared in the upper walls at the west end of the nave. To help counteract this problem, a low arch was constructed, crossing to nave near the entry portals. In 1899, timber flooring was installed between the towers in the west end of the nave to accommodate the installation of the current organ. The low structural arch became the platform&#x27;s east support. This project remains controversial, as the organ pipes currently block the lower western windows and half of the rose window. However, the older and much smaller stone organ platform still survives under the current timber construction.

Although the cathedral suffered some damage during the French Revolution and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, it escaped both World Wars unharmed.

==Architecture==
Contemporary with Noyon Cathedral and Notre-Dame de Paris, Laon Cathedral is one of the most elaborate and best-preserved of the early French Gothic cathedrals. It is notable for the stylistic unity and consistency maintained over the different phases of its construction. The cathedral consists of a cruciform plan with the traditional nave, transepts, and choir, all flanked by single side aisles. Numerous chapels have been built projecting out the exterior aisle walls. The nave has twelve bays (including the bay over the organ platform), counterbalanced by the ten in the choir. Both transepts have four bays. A central lantern tower, the focal point of the cathedral&#x27;s interior, rises over the intersection. The ceiling over the choir and the nave (with the exception of the west end, near the organ) incorporates sexpartite vaulting, while the ceiling in the transepts incorporates quadripartite vaulting.

Vertically, Laon Cathedral is divided into four tiers: ground-level side aisles, a tribune-level passageway with double arches, a short triforium-level passageway with triple arches, and clerestory windows. The passageways on the two middle levels circumnavigate the entirety of the building, possibly indicating Norman influence. The unusual four-tiered configuration was previously used in both Tournai Cathedral in modern-day Belgium and Noyon Cathedral, and is reflected locally in the south transept of nearby Soissons Cathedral. The height of the interior is emphasized by the colonnette shafts rising from the tops of the columns separating the aisle bays; these colonnette shafts regularly alternate between three and five in number.

Although the choirs of most Gothic churches terminate with apses, Laon&#x27;s choir is an exception: it terminates with a flat wall. The cathedral&#x27;s original choir was much shorter, and it terminated in a more conventional apse and ambulatory. Although the original choir encoded the stylistic template for the rest of the building, it was demolished and replaced in the early thirteenth century. The longer, current choir was more proportionally appropriate for the cathedral.

Each end of the church culminates in a rose window, except for the southern transept. Instead, the south transept features a massive arched tracery window, which replaced the original rose in the early fourteenth century. The facades of both transepts incorporate twin entry doors; the south doors open next to the cathedral&#x27;s adjoining cloister and chapter house, while the north doors open near the old episcopal palace. The massive west facade of the cathedral, at the nave end, is notable for its dynamic use of spatial projections. Three deeply recessed portals provide entry into the church; an arched passageway sits over them; between this passageway and a second, higher one, two Gothic-arched lancet windows and the central rose window cut into the wall. The facade is topped by the uppermost portions of the twin towers and four smaller pinnacles.

===Towers===

Of the seven planned towers, only five were completed to the height of the base of the spires. These include the square central crossing tower that forms a lantern tower illuminating the crossing, the two towers flanking the western facade, and the two transept towers. Both transepts were planned to have second towers, which were never completed. Laon Cathedral&#x27;s completed towers (with the exception of that at the central crossing) all consist of two stacked vaulted chambers pierced by lancet openings. They transition from square profiles at their bases to elaborated octagons at their peaks. Medieval artist Villard de Honnecourt made detailed drawings of one of the towers of Laon circa 1230; in his eyes, the towers at Laon perfectly utilized the geometry and &quot;true measure&quot; ideally expressed in Gothic architecture. The two western towers contain life-size stone statues of sixteen oxen in their upper arcades, seemingly commemorating the bullocks who hauled equipment and materials during the cathedral&#x27;s construction.

===Stained glass===
The cathedral&#x27;s stained glass dates mostly from the thirteenth century, with some nineteenth-century augmentations. Among the surviving medieval windows are the three lancet windows at the east end of the church, overlooking the choir. The right window depicts scenes from the life of Mary and from Jesus&#x27; childhood. The central window continues the Jesus narrative, from his triumphal entry into Jerusalem to his ascension. The left windows depicts scenes from the legend of Theophilus of Adana and the Biblical account of Saint Stephen. The rose window above the lancets is dedicated to Mary; it also contains twelve medallions depicting the twelve apostles and twenty-four medallions depicting the Four and Twenty Elders from the Book of Revelation. Departing from strictly religious themes, the rose window in the north transept contains personifications of the sciences of the trivium (grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy).

==Notable people==
* Theologian Anselm of Laon served as dean and chancellor of the cathedral in the early twelfth century.
* Composer Pierre Dumage was organist of the cathedral from 1710 to 1719.
* Adolf Hitler visited the cathedral on June 25, 1940.
* Artist Robert Delaunay depicted the cathedral towers in his 1912 painting &quot;Les Tours de Laon&quot;, exemplifying his transition away from figurative compositions towards the abstract movement of Orphism.

<doc id="548050" wikidata="Q1751934" url="?curid=548050" title="List of universities and colleges in Thailand">
<text>, Thailand had 310 colleges, universities, and tertiary academic institutes. This is a categorized listing of institutions of higher learning in Thailand.

== Public universities and colleges ==
Public universities were formerly called &quot;government universities&quot; and were fully supported by the government. Currently they are independent as government-supported public universities. However, their staff are no longer civil servants. Application is by annual nationwide competitive admission examination or occasionally by special direct application.

=== Autonomous universities ===
Autonomous universities have their own administrative structure and budgeting system for self-governance and full autonomy, allowing decision making on administrative and management matters to be handled by the university itself.


=== Rajabhat Universities ===

There are 40 universities in the Rajabhat Universities system. The universities are designed to provide higher education in provinces. They were formerly called Rajabhat Institutes and originally emerged as colleges of education. Admission is by competitive direct application. Some Rajabhat Universities have several campuses such as Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University.

=== Rajamangala Universities of Technology ===
The Rajamangala University of Technology system includes nine schools. It was formerly a polytechnic institute system and then was renamed &quot;Rajamangala Institute of Technology&quot; before being granted university status. Admission is by direct application.

=== Military and police academies ===
=== College ===
Office of the Vocational Education Commission supervised 416 institutions all over the country for producing and developing professional manpower of the vocational certificate, diploma in technical education and Bachelor’s degree in various fields of technology and operation. There are 9 programs comprising more than 350 subject areas. The Management Centers have been established in 5 regions to promote academic work and develop vocational education in 77 provinces. The management of vocational education colleges at provincial level is linked together. Types of colleges can be found as follows:

<text>Chulalongkorn University (CU, , ), nicknamed Chula (), is a public autonomous research university in Bangkok, Thailand. The university was originally founded during King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s reign as a school for training royal pages and civil servants in 1899 (B.E. 2442) at the Grand Palace. It was later established as a national university in 1917, making it the oldest institute of higher education in Thailand.

During the reign of Chulalongkorn&#x27;s son, King Vajiravudh, the Royal Pages School became the Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn. The Rockefeller Foundation was instrumental in helping the college form its academic foundation. On 26 March 1917, King Vajiravudh renamed the college &quot;Chulalongkorn University&quot;.

Chulalongkorn University is one of the National Research Universities and supported by the Office of Nation Education Standards and Quality Assessment of Thailand. Moreover, CU is the only Thai university which is a member of Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU).

CU is composed of nineteen faculties, a School of Agriculture, three colleges, ten institutes and two other schools. Its campus occupies a vast area in downtown Bangkok. Graduates customarily receive their diplomas from the King of Thailand, a tradition begun by King Prajadhipok.

==History==

King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s reforms, aimed at transforming Thailand into a modern state, demanded trained officials specialized in various fields. In 1899, the King founded the &quot;Civil Service Training School&quot; near the north gate of the Grand Palace. Those who graduated from the school would become royal pages. As royal pages, they learned how to manage organizations by working closely with the king, which was a traditional way to enter the Siamese bureaucracy. After serving as royal pages, they would then serve in the Ministry of Interior or other government ministries.

On 1 April 1902, the King renamed the school. It became the &quot;Royal Pages School&quot; (). On 1 January 1911, King Vajiravudh changed the name to &quot;Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn&quot; () as a memorial to his father and moved the school to Windsor Palace in the Pathumwan District.

The King subsidized the construction of a university campus and organized various schools around the city into Chulalongkorn. The college offered eight majors taught by five schools including;

* School of International Relations in the Royal Palace
* School of Teacher Training at Baan Somdet Chao Phraya
* Royal Medical College at Siriraj Hospital
* School of Legal Studies
* School of Mechanical Sciences at Windsor Palace

King Rama VI realized that education should be provided not only to bureaucrats, but to all people. On 26 March 1917, the college was upgraded to &quot;Chulalongkorn University&quot; (), and the schools were transformed into four faculties: Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Faculty of Public Administration, Faculty of Engineering, and Faculty of Medicine.

The Rockefeller Foundation reorganized the curriculum of the Faculty of Medicine. In 1923, the Faculty of Medicine became the first faculty to accept secondary school (Mattayom) graduates. The remaining faculties then followed suit. After the 1932 Revolution, the People&#x27;s Party wanted legal and political studies to be independent of &quot;royalists&quot; so they moved the Faculty of Law and Political Science to the new Thammasat University in 1933.

In 1938, Chulalongkorn University&#x27;s Preparatory School was founded to provide pre-collegiate education to students. Those who managed to enter the university had to spend two years in the Preparatory School before going on to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Preparatory School, however, ceased to be a university-owned preparatory school in 1947 and became the independent Triam Udom Suksa School. Later, the university established Chulalongkorn University Demonstration School (CUD) as a laboratory school for primary and secondary education for the Faculty of Education.


== Symbols ==
===Phra Kiao===
Since the establishment of the Royal Pages School, the former name of the university, King Chulalongkorn authorized the use of his personal emblem as a school emblem. The emblem is called &quot;Phra Kiao&quot;, a Thai coronet, royal headgear for young princes and princesses. As the school was transformed into the university, the King authorized the use of &quot;phra kiao&quot;. Today, &quot;phra kiao&quot; appears not only in formal letters and transcripts, but also on souvenirs made by the university as well as student uniforms.

===Student uniform===
Undergraduates are required to wear a uniform when studying, taking examinations, or contacting the university in person. Male graduate students wear a collared or polo shirt and dark trousers. Women wear a plain blouse with long skirt.

Originally, the university uniform was adapted from a uniform worn by Chulalongkorn&#x27;s heirs. The uniform was later updated, but the original is reserved as a formal uniform. The formal uniform is usually worn by student leaders and graduates.

Today, the ordinary uniform for male undergraduate students consists of a plain white shirt with long or short sleeves and black (or dark blue) trousers. Wearing a dark blue necktie with colored &quot;phra kiao&quot; engraved on its front is mandatory for first-year students but optional for higher years. However, a black tie with a silver &quot;phra kiao&quot; pin is usually used by upperclass student in some faculties. Female students are required to wear a short-sleeved blouse with a fold along the spine. The buttons must be made of metal, and a small &quot;phra kiao&quot; emblem must be pinned on the right breast. A dark blue or black pleated skirt with any black, white, or brown shoes are worn. For female first-year students, white leather shoes are mandatory. Chulalongkorn University&#x27;s uniforms have long been the template of many uniforms used in other universities in Thailand.

=== Academic dress ===
The academic dress of Chulalongkorn University is based on ceremonial attire called &quot;khrui&quot;, a gown made from very fine mesh. The robe was originally reserved for pre-ordination monks, ministers and royal family members. Like dresses worn in the United Kingdom, the robe is open-fronted and calf-length. Cap and hood, however, are omitted. The gown is faced and lined with a felt strip dyed according to the status of the wearer and decorated with gold ribbons. The elbow and wrist portion of the gown is also wrapped with the same felt strip. 

Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s gown is faced and bordered with a black felt strip, while a doctor&#x27;s gown uses a scarlet felt strip. This colour scheme is similar to one used at the University of Oxford: Black for bachelors and masters (and doctors in undress); Scarlet for doctors (in full-dress). The cord (bachelor) or ribbon (master and doctor) dyed with the faculty colour is attached to the centre of the felt strip longitudinally. Officers&#x27; (lecturers, university council members, vice-chancellor and chancellor) gown is faced with a pink strip and centred with a gold thread, regardless of the faculty. The specially designed gown with a yellow facing is reserved for the king of Thailand, who is also Visitor to the University.

Vajiravudh authorized the university to use the traditional Thai gown instead of the western one, but the regulation on this matter was enacted in 1930 by Prajadhipok.

==== Example of felt strips ====
===Rain Trees===
Rain trees are common on the university campus. They are associated with the cycle of student life. Fresh green leaves at beginning of the term represent the freshmen&#x27;s naivete. As the tree produces slimy pods and sheds leaves, the ground beneath it becomes slippery, thus alerting students to prepare for examinations. If they walk carefully, they will not slip (pass examinations). If they walk heedlessly, they will slip and fall (fail examinations).

From 1937–1957, many rain trees were cut down to free space for new buildings. King Bhumibol Adulyadej noticed the dramatic decrease in the number of rain trees. On 15 January 1962, he brought five trees from Hua Hin and planted them in front of the university auditorium, proclaiming: &quot;...I give these five trees as an eternal memorial.&quot; ().

==Organization==
 

Chulalongkorn University consists of 19 faculties, three colleges, one school and many institutes which function as teaching and research units.

In 1917, the university had four faculties: Arts and Sciences, Public Administration, Engineering, and Medicine. The Faculty of Law was established in 1933 as part of the Faculty of Law and Political Science. From the 1930s to the 1950s it expanded to various fields including Pharmacy (1934), Veterinary Science (1935), Architecture (1939), Dentistry (1940), and Commerce and Accountancy (1943). In 1943, the regency government under General Phibun separated the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science to become the University of Medical Sciences, now Mahidol University. In 1948, the Faculty of Political Science was re-established. The Faculty of Education was established in 1957 from the School of Teacher Training at Baan Somdet Chao Phraya (). In 1967, the Faculty of Veterinary Science was returned from Kasetsart University and the Faculty of Medicine at Chulalongkorn Hospital was moved from University of Medical Sciences to Chulalongkorn University. In 1972, the Faculty of Dentistry and Faculty of Pharmacy were reinstated.

The Office of the Commission on Agricultural Resource Education (OCARE) was established in 2009. It is not an administrative office, but a school in which teaching and research are carried out. It admits students from two groups: one from northern Thai provinces (Nan, Phayao, Phrae, Uttaradit) and another from the rest of country. It was upgraded to the School of Agricultural Resources with full degree-granting power on 5 March 2014. In 2014 it became the School of Agriculture, Chulalongkorn University (SAR). 

In 2019, aiming to address global industry changes and demand for relevant education, Chulalongkorn University launched Chulalongkorn School of Integrated Innovation (ScII) to offer the first in Asia interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in both arts and science - Bachelor of Arts and Science in Integrated Innovation (BAScii).

<text>Boronia is an eastern suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 29 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox local government area. Boronia recorded a population of 23,607 at the 2021 census.

The area was originally occupied by the Wurundjeri, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group.

==History==

Prior to European settlement, Boronia and surrounding suburbs were often visited by Aboriginals from the Westernport and Yarra Yarra tribes, hunting during the summer months in the Dandenong Ranges and its foothills. The Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation are the acknowledged traditional custodians of the land on which Boronia and all of City of Knox is located.

In its early days of European settlement, Boronia was predominantly an orchard, flower growing and farming area.

Boronia was named in 1915 by local Councillor A. E. Chandler (prior to this, Boronia was considered part of Bayswater). Chandler named the suburb Boronia after the plant, boronia, which grew on his property at The Basin. The plant was discovered by Ferdinand von Mueller, an Austrian botanist, who came to Australia during the colonial period.

Boronia railway station opened in 1920, leading to an influx of residents and Boronia Post Office opened on 1 October 1920. A further influx occurred in the 1960s and 1970s.

Boronia&#x27;s most impressive historical building is Miller Homestead. Originally built in 1888 for John Miller, who was originally from Bayswater, London and the first president of the Shire of Fern Tree Gully (from which the Shire of Knox separated in 1963), later proclaimed the City of Knox on 4th July 1969, and justice of the peace. The original property included stables and horse training facilities and was over in size. The property was sub-divided in 1971. Miller homestead is classified by the National Trust of Australia (Vic).

Boronia is a tree-lined suburb, with views of the National Park and the city of Melbourne (from the foothills themselves). There are also nature reserves and extensive bike paths/lanes. Boronia includes sections of the Dandenong Ranges foothills and thus possesses many hills itself. It has the beautiful, natural, green backdrop of the hills and the Dandenong Ranges National Park. Knox City Council have endeavoured to protect this green backdrop to Melbourne by developing pro-environment planning guidelines.

For years, Boronia had been split in two by the Belgrave railway line and a bottleneck railway crossing across the two main thoroughfares—Boronia and Dorset Roads. This crossing was the scene of a level crossing accident on 1 June 1952 that took 13 lives and was regarded at the time as one of the worst level crossing tragedies in Victoria&#x27;s history. In the mid-1990s, VicRoads proposed the reconstruction the Boronia and Dorset Roads intersection, with the railway line being located underground and a new railway station built in a concrete cutting—ending the separation of the two-halves of the suburb and uniting Boronia. The new tunnel and intersection opened in 1998, with the land which the railway used to occupy (housing the Country Fire Authority, railway station and large playground/park) being converted into a new shopping centre and carpark.

==Community groups==

There are numerous community and service groups in Boronia, including a Lions Club, a Rotary Club, the Returned and Services League (RSL), YWCA Women&#x27;s Group, Probus Clubs, Country Women&#x27;s Association, VIEW Club, Scouts and various church groups that build community and/or provide meals, such as St Paul&#x27;s Anglican, Boronia Road Uniting Church, Mountain District Vineyard, Boronia Church of Christ and St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church.

The Boronia CFA Fire Station was located where the Boronia Junction and Woolworths supermarket now stands and after becoming both a permanently staffed CFA station along with volunteers it relocated to near the intersection of Scoresby and Boronia Roads where it is now a Fire Rescue Victoria Fire Station.

==Sport and leisure==

Amenities include a 24-hour gymnasium and Knox Leisureworks, a swimming pool and exercise centre managed by Belgravia Leisure.

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, the Boronia Hawks, competing in the Eastern Football League. The club is based at Tormore Reserve, which is a cricket ground in the summer months as the home ground of the Boronia Cricket Club.

Other activities include the Boronia Bowls Club, health and fitness centres, netball clubs, an internet cafe, swimming schools/clubs, martial arts schools, a pool club, rehabilitation clinics, bike paths and numerous small parks and playgrounds, Boronia Weightlifting Club and calisthenics schools. Knox Basketball Stadium, which was built in 1975 and slated for decommissioning in 2017, is located in Boronia and is home to Knox Basketball Incorporated. There is also a library and a radio-control car club and raceway in the basketball stadium precinct. A new Dance and Cheerleading school was opened in February 2008.

Boronia Soccer Club is based in the neighbouring suburb of Ferntree Gully. It has teams from U12 - U18. It also has a junior’s program, which anyone from the age of 6-18 can attend.

The Eastern Raptors play rugby league in NRL Victoria.

==Retail==

Boronia Junction, a relatively new shopping centre, was completed over 2000–2001. Boronia Junction includes an AMF Bowling Centre, a number of restaurants and a hairdresser. There has been a cinema in Boronia for many decades (although not continuously). Metro Cinemas opened in 2005 (in the former Village Cinemas complex in Dorset Square). Boronia boasts over 11 restaurants, including Indian, Thai, Malaysian, Chinese and Italian cuisine.

The other two shopping precincts in Boronia are Boronia Village and Dorset Square (including Boronia Mall). There is also the Dorset Arcade and Chandler Arcade, both run by the Boronia Chamber of Commerce. Boronia is currently being targeted by Knox City Council for rejuvenation, in consultation with resident interest groups. Major works are intended for the Dorset Square retail and entertainment precinct during 2008.

Dorset Calisthenics College is also located in Boronia.

==Education==

There are a number of kindergartens located in Boronia. There are also four primary schools in Boronia; Knox Central Primary School, Boronia Heights Primary, Boronia West Primary and St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary school.

Boronia K-12 College, established in 2012 merged with Boronia Primary School, Allendale Kindergarten and Boronia Heights College on Boronia Primary School&#x27;s campus. It ran concurrently as the Rangeview Campus, until the Mountview Campus (Boronia Heights College) closed in 2014.

Boronia High School (also known as Tormore Secondary College) closed in 1991.

<doc id="548069" wikidata="Q7760316" url="?curid=548069" title="The Rest of the Story">
<text>The Rest of the Story was a Monday-through-Friday radio program originally hosted by Paul Harvey. Beginning as a part of his newscasts during the Second World War and then premiering as its own series on the ABC Radio Networks on May 10, 1976, &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; consisted of stories presented as little-known or forgotten facts on a variety of subjects with some key element of the story (usually the name of some well-known person) held back until the end. The broadcasts always concluded with a variation on the tag line, &quot;And now you know...the &quot;rest&quot; of the story.&quot; On the majority of radio stations, it often served as a mid-afternoon drive counterpart to Harvey&#x27;s noontime &quot;News and Comment&quot;.

From its inception, the scripts for the series had been drafted and the broadcasts produced by Harvey&#x27;s son Paul Harvey Jr., who in later years of his father&#x27;s career also acted as a substitute host. Some of the radio stories were published in book form as &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; and &quot;More of The Rest of the Story&quot;. (On the back cover of &quot;More of The Rest of the Story&quot;, the book is said to contain &quot;True mysteries from history&quot;.) After the elder Harvey&#x27;s death on February 28, 2009, ABC radio host Doug Limerick was chosen as the show&#x27;s new host. &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; was canceled after three weeks with Limerick as host.

<doc id="548070" wikidata="Q849241" url="?curid=548070" title="Temple of Portunus">
<text>The Temple of Portunus () is an ancient Roman temple in Rome, Italy. It was built beside the Forum Boarium, the Roman cattle market associated with Hercules, which was adjacent to Rome&#x27;s oldest river port () and the oldest stone bridge across the Tiber River, the Pons Aemilius. It was probably dedicated to the gateway god Portunus although the precise dedication remains unclear as there were several other temples in the area besides his. It was misidentified as the Temple of Fortuna Virilis (Latin for &quot;Manly Luck&quot;) from the Renaissance and remains better known by this name. The temple is one of the best preserved of all Roman temples.

It is dedicated to Portunus, the god of keys, doors and livestock, and so granaries, it is the main temple dedicated to the god in the city. During the Medieval period, the temple was converted to a Christian church dedicated to Santa Maria Egyziaca (&quot;St Mary of Egypt&quot;). It remained a church up until the early 20th century, when it was deconsecrated, stripped of all later additions, and returned to its classical appearance, as an archaeological monument. This restoration included the demolition of surrounding medieval and Renaissance era buildings.

==Architecture==

It is in the Ionic order and is by the ancient Forum Boarium by the Tiber. During Antiquity the site overlooked the Tiberine port at a sharp bend in the river; from here, Portunus watched over cattle barges as they entered the city from Ostia.
The temple was originally built in the 3rd or 4th century BC and was rebuilt between 120 and 80 BC. The rectangular building consists of a tetrastyle portico and cella, raised on a high podium reached by a flight of steps, which it retains. Like the Maison Carrée in Nîmes, it has a &quot;pronaos&quot; portico of four Ionic columns across and two columns deep. The columns of the portico are free-standing, while the remaining five columns on the long sides and the four columns at the rear are half-columns engaged along the walls of the cella. This form is sometimes called &quot;pseudoperipteral&quot;, as distinct from a true peripteral temple like the Parthenon entirely surrounded by free-standing columns. The Ionic capitals are of the original form, different in the frontal and side views, except in the volutes at the corners, which project at 45°, a common Roman detail. It is built of tuff and travertine with a stucco surface.

If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. The temple owes its state of preservation to its being converted for use as a church in 872 and rededicated to &quot;Santa Maria Egiziaca&quot; (Saint Mary of Egypt). Its Ionic order has been much admired, drawn and engraved and copied since the 16th century. The original coating of stucco over its tufa and travertine construction has been lost.

The circular Temple of Hercules Victor is south-east of the temple in the Forum Boarium.

The 18th century Temple of Harmony in Somerset, England is a folly based on the Temple of Portunus.

<text>Star lifting is any of several hypothetical processes by which a sufficiently advanced civilization (specifically, one of Kardashev-II or higher) could remove a substantial portion of a star&#x27;s matter which can then be re-purposed, while possibly optimizing the star&#x27;s energy output and lifespan at the same time. The term appears to have been coined by David Criswell.

Stars already lose a small flow of mass via solar wind, coronal mass ejections, and other natural processes. Over the course of a star&#x27;s life on the main sequence this loss is usually negligible compared to the star&#x27;s total mass; only at the end of a star&#x27;s life when it becomes a red giant or a supernova is a large proportion of material ejected. The star lifting techniques that have been proposed would operate by increasing this natural plasma flow and manipulating it with magnetic fields.

Stars have deep gravity wells, so the energy required for such operations is large. For example, lifting solar material from the surface of the Sun to the planet Mercury requires 1.6 × 1013 J/kg. This energy could be supplied by the star itself, collected by a Dyson sphere; using 10% of the Sun&#x27;s total power output would allow 5.9 × 1021 kilograms of matter to be lifted per year (0.0000003% of the Sun&#x27;s total mass), or 8% of the mass of Earth&#x27;s moon.

==Methods for lifting material==

===Thermal-driven outflow===

The simplest system for star lifting would increase the rate of solar wind outflow by directly heating small regions of the star&#x27;s atmosphere, using any of a number of different means to deliver energy such as microwave beams, lasers, or particle beams – whatever proved to be most efficient for the engineers of the system. This would produce a large and sustained eruption similar to a solar flare at the target location, feeding the solar wind.

The resulting outflow would be collected by using a ring current around the star&#x27;s equator to generate a powerful toroidal magnetic field with its dipoles over the star&#x27;s rotational poles. This would deflect the star&#x27;s solar wind into a pair of jets aligned along its rotational axis passing through a pair of magnetic rocket nozzles. The magnetic nozzles would convert some of the plasma&#x27;s thermal energy into outward velocity, helping cool the outflow. The ring current required to generate this magnetic field would be generated by a ring of particle accelerator space stations in close orbit around the star&#x27;s equator. These accelerators would be physically separate from each other but would exchange two counterdirected beams of oppositely charged ions with their neighbor on each side, forming a complete circuit around the star.

===&quot;Huff-n-Puff&quot;===
David Criswell proposed a modification to the polar jet system in which the magnetic field could be used to increase solar wind outflow directly, without requiring additional heating of the star&#x27;s surface. He dubbed it the &quot;Huff-n-Puff&quot; method, inspired from the Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s threats in the fairy tale of &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;.

In this system the ring of particle accelerators would not be in orbit, instead depending on the outward force of the magnetic field itself for support against the star&#x27;s gravity. To inject energy into the star&#x27;s atmosphere the ring current would first be temporarily shut down, allowing the particle accelerator stations to begin falling freely toward the star&#x27;s surface. Once the stations had developed sufficient inward velocity the ring current would be reactivated and the resulting magnetic field would be used to reverse the stations&#x27; fall. This would &quot;squeeze&quot; the star, propelling stellar atmosphere through the polar magnetic nozzles. The ring current would be shut down again before the ring stations achieved enough outward velocity to throw them too far away from the star, and the star&#x27;s gravity would be allowed to pull them back inward to repeat the cycle.

A single set of ring stations would result in a very intermittent flow. It is possible to smooth this flow out by using multiple sets of ring stations, with each set operating in a different stage of the Huff-n-Puff cycle at any given moment so that there is always one ring &quot;squeezing&quot;. This would also smooth out the power requirements of the system over time.

===Centrifugal acceleration===
An alternative to the Huff-n-Puff method for using the toroidal magnetic field to increase solar wind outflow involves placing the ring stations in a polar orbit rather than an equatorial one. The two magnetic nozzles would then be located on the star&#x27;s equator. To increase the rate of outflow through these two equatorial jets, the ring system would be rotated around the star at a rate significantly faster than the star&#x27;s natural rotation. This would cause the stellar atmosphere swept up by the magnetic field to be flung outward.

This method suffers from a number of significant complications compared to the others. Rotating the ring in this manner would require the ring stations to use powerful rocket thrust, requiring both large rocket systems and a large amount of reaction mass. This reaction mass can be &quot;recycled&quot; by directing the rockets&#x27; exhausts so that it impacts the star&#x27;s surface, but harvesting fresh reaction mass from the star&#x27;s outflow and delivering it to the ring stations in sufficient quantity adds still more complexity to the system. Finally, the resulting jets would spiral outward from the star&#x27;s equator rather than emerging straight from the poles; this could complicate harvesting it, as well as the arrangement of the Dyson sphere powering the system.

==Harvesting lifted mass==
The material lifted from a star will emerge in the form of plasma jets hundreds or thousands of astronomical units long, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and highly diffuse by current engineering standards. The details of extracting useful materials from this stream and storing the vast quantities that would result have not been extensively explored. One possible approach is to purify useful elements from the jets using extremely large-scale mass spectrometry, cool them by laser cooling, and condense them on particles of dust for collection. An alternative method could involve using large solenoids to slow the jets down and separate out the components. Electricity would also be generated via this system. Small artificial gas giant planets could be constructed from excess hydrogen and helium to store it for future use. Excess gas could also be used to build new earthlike planets to custom specifications.

In the case of the Solar System, one possible use for material harvested from the Sun would be to add it to Jupiter. Increasing Jupiter&#x27;s mass about 100-fold would turn it into a star, allowing it to supply energy to its moons and also to the asteroid belt. However, this would have to be done carefully to avoid catastrophically changing the orbits of other bodies in the Solar System.

==Stellar husbandry==
The lifespan of a star is determined by the size of its supply of nuclear &quot;fuel&quot; and the rate at which it uses up that fuel in fusion reactions in its core. Although larger stars have a larger supply of fuel, the increased core pressure resulting from that additional mass vastly increases the burn rate; thus large stars have a significantly shorter lifespan than small ones. Current theories of stellar dynamics also suggest that there is very little mixing between the bulk of a star&#x27;s atmosphere and the material of its core, where fusion takes place, so most of a large star&#x27;s fuel will never be used naturally. Small red dwarf stars, which are naturally fully convective, allow their core helium to mix with the outer layers of hydrogen which allows extremely long stellar lifespans on the order of trillions of years.

As a star&#x27;s mass is reduced by star lifting its rate of nuclear fusion will decrease, reducing the amount of energy available to the star lifting process but also reducing the gravity that needs to be overcome. Theoretically, it would be possible to remove an arbitrarily large portion of a star&#x27;s total mass given sufficient time. In this manner a civilization could control the rate at which its star uses fuel, optimizing the star&#x27;s power output and lifespan to its needs. The hydrogen and helium extracted in the process could itself be utilized to fuel fusion reactors. Alternatively, the material could be assembled into additional smaller stars, to improve the efficiency of its use. Theoretically, most of the energy stored in the matter lifted from a star could be harvested if it is made into small black holes, via the mechanism of Hawking radiation.

==In fiction==

*In the series &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, the Ancient ship Destiny and the seed ships sent 2,000 years before Destiny are fueled by plasma from stars. The ship skims over the surface of a star just before dipping below the star&#x27;s photosphere to scoop in plasma using its retractable collectors.
*In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise of &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, the Star Forge is capable of star lifting. In a way, Starkiller Base in the seventh canonical film star lifts in order to power its planet-destroying laser cannon, although it consumes the entire star to do so.
*The novel &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – The Murdered Sun&quot; featured a reptilian race using the material from a star to sustain the opening of a wormhole. However, the novel depicted the process as shortening the star&#x27;s lifespan precipitously rather than extending it.
*In &quot;The Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy&quot; by Peter F. Hamilton, the alien species the Kiint created an arc of custom made planets around their sun from mass extracted from their star.
*In the Doctor Who episode &quot;42&quot; the crew of the starship &quot;Pentallian&quot; use a Sun scoop to draw matter from a star to use as fuel for their ship.
*In the novella &quot;Palimpsest&quot; by Charles Stross, the Stasis uses star lifting to replace the core of the Sun with a black hole, producing a &quot;necrostar&quot; with vastly expanded lifespan.
*In the novel &quot;The Time Ships&quot; by Stephen Baxter, the Morlocks create a Dyson sphere inside the orbit of Earth using matter lifted from the Sun.
*In the short story &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot; by Ray Bradbury, humans fly the rocket Copa de Oro to the Sun and dip a mechanical cup into it to capture the star&#x27;s warmth for Earth.
*In the video game series &quot;Destiny&quot;, the mechanical race known as the Vex use star lifts to artificially extend the life of their Forge Star 2082 Volantis.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes story by Arthur Conan Doyle. This tale is in the collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was originally published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (US) in February 1904 and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; (UK) in March 1904.

==Plot==

Forest Row in the Weald is the scene of a harpoon murder, and a young police inspector, Stanley Hopkins, asks Holmes, whom he admires, for help. Holmes has already determined that it would take a great deal of strength and skill to run a man through with a harpoon and embed it in the wall behind him.

Peter Carey, the 50-year-old victim and former master of the &quot;Sea Unicorn&quot; of Dundee, who lived with his wife and daughter, had a reputation for being violent. Carey did not sleep in the family house, but in a small cottage that he built some distance from the house, whose interior he had decorated to look like a sailor&#x27;s cabin on a ship. This is where he was found harpooned. Hopkins could find no footprints or other physical evidence. However, a tobacco pouch made of sealskin and with the initials &quot;P.C.&quot; was found at the scene, which was full of strong ship&#x27;s tobacco. This is rather unusual, as Peter Carey—or &quot;Black Peter&quot; as people called him—seldom smoked. Indeed, Hopkins found no pipe in the cabin. Carey was found fully dressed, suggesting that he was expecting a visitor, and there was some rum laid out along with two dirty glasses. There were brandy and whisky, too, but neither had been touched. There was also a knife in its sheath at Carey&#x27;s feet; Mrs. Carey has identified it as her husband&#x27;s. A little notebook was also found at the scene. It contains the initials J. H. N. and the year 1883. It also says C. P. R. on the second page, which Holmes reckons stands for Canadian Pacific Railway. The first set of initials is likely a stockbroker&#x27;s, as the little book is full of what appears to be stock exchange information.

Holmes decides to accompany Hopkins to Forest Row, and upon arrival, Hopkins observes that someone has tried to break into Carey&#x27;s cabin, but failed. After examining the inside of the cabin, Holmes deduces from the lack of dust that something has been taken from a shelf, even though the burglar did not get in. The stolen item was a book, or possibly a box. Holmes believes that the burglar will likely try again, this time bringing a more useful tool for the job. So, Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Hopkins all lie in wait for the burglar that night, and they are not disappointed. Along he comes, he breaks into the cabin, and goes through one of Carey&#x27;s old logbooks, cursing when he finds that the information that he wants is missing, having been torn out of the book. As he is leaving the cabin, Hopkins moves in and arrests him.
He is John Hopley Neligan—which matches the initials in the notebook—the son of a long-vanished, failed banker. He claims he was looking at Carey&#x27;s logs to test a theory of his. His father disappeared with a box full of securities after his bank failed. He took them on a yacht bound for Norway. He believes that his father&#x27;s boat may have been driven north on the North Sea by bad weather, and met the &quot;Sea Unicorn&quot;, captained by Carey. He believes that Carey knew something about his father&#x27;s disappearance, and that possibly his father was murdered by the man who has now himself become a murder victim as he has traced some of his father&#x27;s long lost securities back to Carey. Hopkins takes Neligan off to the station, even though Neligan swears that he has nothing to do with the murder. Holmes believes this to be true, because Neligan is a slight, anaemic thin man, hardly capable of running a man through with a harpoon.

Holmes saves Neligan from the noose by finding the true killer in a most unusual way. He advertises for a harpooner, posing as a sea captain named Basil. He gets three applicants at 221B Baker Street for the job, and one of them is indeed Peter Carey&#x27;s killer, as confirmed by his name, Patrick Cairns, and the fact that Holmes had established that he was once Carey&#x27;s shipmate. Holmes also felt sure that a murderer would want to leave the country for a while. Holmes handcuffs the unaware Cairns after which Cairns confesses. While he freely admits to killing Carey, he furiously denies that it was murder, claiming self-defence. He was actually at Carey&#x27;s cabin to extort hush money from him. Neligan&#x27;s father had indeed come aboard the &quot;Sea Unicorn&quot; with his tin box of securities, and Carey had murdered him by throwing him overboard while he believed no-one was looking, though Cairns had secretly witnessed the event. While Carey initially had agreed to the payoff, when Cairns came to collect, things were different. The two drank together, during which Carey&#x27;s mood darkened. When Carey reached for his knife, which Cairns viewed as a threat, he took action. Cairns then examined the box of securities, but finding them impossible for him to sell, escaped, leaving &quot;his&quot; tobacco pouch on the table.

The rum was another clue. Holmes was sure that it, and the fact that the brandy and whiskey had been left alone, were sure signs that the killer was a seaman. Neligan is released and the securities returned to him, although the ones that Carey sold cannot be recovered.

==Publication history==

&quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 27 February 1904, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
A silent short film adapted from the story was released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins, Hugh Buckler as Patrick Cairns, and Fred Paul as Captain Peter Carey.

The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.

There is a visual reference to the &quot;Black Peter&quot; storyline in &quot;The Hounds of Baskerville&quot; (2012), the second episode of the second season of the BBC series &quot;Sherlock&quot; (2010–2017).

The first episode of the 2013 Russian TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is based on the story.

In March 2017, the US TV series &quot;Elementary&quot; (a modern version of Sherlock Holmes) used the &quot;Black Peter&quot; story as the basis for an episode called &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The plot of the episode is driven by the search for the treasure of a pirate named Black Peter. The murder victim (one of the searchers) is impaled with a sword, and, like in the short story, a suspect named Neligan (a teenaged girl in this case; her father, named John Neligan, was also briefly suspected) is judged as being innocent due to lacking the strength to impale the victim.

===Radio and audio dramas===
A radio adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot;, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 11 May 1931 in the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 8 December 1940. Another episode in the same series was adapted from the story by Max Ehrlich and aired in October 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Wendell Holmes as Watson).

&quot;Black Peter&quot; was adapted twice for the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The first adaptation, dramatised by Alan Wilson, aired in March 1961 on the BBC Light Programme, and featured Michael Turner as Inspector Hopkins and Eric Woodburn as Cairns. The second adaptation, dramatised by Michael Hardwick, aired in July 1969 on BBC Radio 2, and featured Arnold Peters as Hopkins and Henry Stamper as Cairns.

An audio drama adaptation was released on LP record in 1970, as one of several audio dramas starring Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick (who also adapted the 1969 radio adaptation) and Mollie Hardwick.

&quot;Black Peter&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by David Ashton as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Alex Norton as Cairns.

The story was adapted as a 2012 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2025, the podcast &quot;Sherlock &amp; Co.&quot; adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;Black Peter&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Other media===
In 2014, Frogwares released a video game titled &quot;Sherlock Holmes: Crimes &amp; Punishments&quot;, the first case of which &quot;The Fate of Black Peter&quot; adapts the elements of this story.

<text>Comiskey Park was a ballpark in Chicago, Illinois, located in the Armour Square neighborhood on the near-southwest side of the city. The stadium served as the home of the Chicago White Sox of the American League from 1910 through 1990. Built by White Sox owner Charles Comiskey and designed by Zachary Taylor Davis, Comiskey Park hosted four World Series and more than 6,000 Major League Baseball games. The field also hosted one of the most famous boxing matches in history: Joe Louis&#x27; defeat of champion James J. Braddock, launching his 11-year run as the heavyweight champion of the world.

The Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League also called Comiskey Park home when they were not playing at Normal Park, Soldier Field, or Wrigley Field. They won the 1947 NFL Championship Game over the Philadelphia Eagles at Comiskey Park. Much less popular than the Bears, the Cardinals had their last season at Comiskey in 1958, and they left for St. Louis in March 1960. The Chicago American Giants of the Negro American League called Comiskey Park home from 1941 to 1950. The park was also home to the Chicago Mustangs and Chicago Sting of the NASL, and hosted the final edition of the original Soccer Bowl.

The park was demolished in 1991, after a new Comiskey Park stadium (later renamed U.S. Cellular Field, then Rate Field) opened just to the south.

==Early years==

White Sox Park was built on a former city dump that Charles Comiskey bought in 1909 to replace the wooden South Side Park. Within three years, it was renamed Comiskey Park. The original name was restored in 1962, then it changed back to Comiskey Park in 1976.

Comiskey Park was very modern for its time. It was the third concrete-and-steel stadium in the major leagues to be built since 1909. As originally built, it seated almost 32,000, a record at the time. Briefly, it retained the nickname &quot;The Baseball Palace of the World&quot;. Light towers were added in 1939.

The park&#x27;s design was strongly influenced by Sox pitcher Ed Walsh, and was known for its pitcher-friendly proportions ( to the foul poles; to center field). Later changes were made, but the park remained more or less favorable to defensive teams. For many years this reflected on the White Sox style of play: solid defense, and short, quick hits. The park was unusual in that no player hit 100 home runs there: Carlton Fisk set the record with 94.

The first game in Comiskey Park was a 2–0 loss to the St. Louis Browns on July 1, 1910. The first no-hitter at Comiskey Park was in 1911, hurled by Ed Walsh on August 27, a 5–0 win over Boston. The Sox won their first home night game, over St. Louis on August 14, 1939, 5–2.

==Special baseball events==
===World Series===
Comiskey Park was the site of four World Series contests. In 1917, the Chicago White Sox won Games 1, 2 and 5 at Comiskey Park and went on to defeat the New York Giants four games to two. In 1918, Comiskey Park hosted the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox. The Cubs borrowed Comiskey Park for the series because of its larger seating capacity. The Red Sox defeated the Cubs four games to two. Games 1–3 were played at Comiskey Park. The Red Sox won games one and three. Attendance was under capacity in that war year. The best crowd was Game 3, with some 27,000 patrons.

In 1919, the White Sox lost the infamous &quot;Black Sox&quot; World Series to the Cincinnati Reds, five games to three in a nine-game series. Games three, four, five and eight were played at Comiskey Park. The White Sox won game three and lost games four, five and eight.

In 1959, the White Sox lost four games to two to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Games one, two and six were played at Comiskey Park. The White Sox won game one and lost games two and six. With their win in Game 6 at Comiskey Park, the Los Angeles Dodgers became the first West Coast team to win a World Series.

Comiskey saw its last post-season action in 1983, when the White Sox lost the American League Championship Series to the Baltimore Orioles 3–1, with Games 3 and 4 in Chicago. Baltimore went on to win the World Series.

===All-Star Games===
Comiskey Park was the site of three Major League Baseball All-Star Games, and each marked a turn in the direction of dominance by one league or the other:
*The first All-Star Game was held in 1933. It began as a promotion by Arch Ward, sports editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, in connection with the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition being held on Chicago&#x27;s lakefront. The Americans defeated the Nationals, helped in part by a home run by Babe Ruth, who was nearing the end of his career, but could still swing a mighty bat. The game also inaugurated a stretch when the Americans dominated, winning 12 of the first 16 (skipping 1945 because of wartime travel restrictions).
*The park next hosted the July classic in 1950, a game best remembered for Ted Williams&#x27; collision with the outfield wall that broke his elbow and ended his playing season. Less remembered is that it began a turnaround for the Nationals, who won the game in extra innings and started to win frequently, a trend that continued for more than three decades, building up an astounding 30 wins against only 6 losses and 1 tie (from 1959 to 1962 two games were held each year).
*The 50th Anniversary All-Star Game in 1983 was held at Comiskey Park in commemoration of the first All-Star Game at that same venue. The American League&#x27;s lopsided win, including the first-ever grand slam in an All-Star Game, by Fred Lynn, turned out to signal an end to the National League&#x27;s dominance in the mid-summer classic. During the last eight years of the park&#x27;s existence the Americans went 5–3. Hosting a winning All-Star Game was also a good omen for the Sox, as they won their division in 1983, the first baseball title of any kind in Chicago since the Sox won the 1959 pennant.
*Comiskey Park was the most frequent home to the Negro leagues East-West All-Star Game from 1933 to 1960. The Negro leagues&#x27; all-star game achieved higher attendance in some years than its Major League Baseball counterpart, thanks in part to Comiskey&#x27;s high attendance capacity.

==Fans==
From 1971 until its demolition in 1991, Comiskey was the oldest park still in use in Major League Baseball (it had already been the oldest in the American League since 1955). Many of its known characteristics, such as the pinwheels on the &quot;exploding&quot; scoreboard, were installed by Bill Veeck (owner of the White Sox from 1959 to 1961, and again from 1976 to 1981). Another Veeck innovation was the &quot;picnic area&quot;, created by replacing portions of the left field walls (the side of the field not facing the setting sun) with screens and setting up picnic tables under the seating areas. This concept was later extended to right field. During Veeck&#x27;s second ownership, he installed a shower behind the speaker horns in the center field bleachers, for fans to cool off on hot summer days.

From 1960 to 1990, Sox fans were also entertained by Andy the Clown, famous for his famous Jerry Colonna-like elongated cry, &quot;Come ooooooooooon, go! White! Sox!&quot;
Starting in the 1970s, Sox fans were further entertained by organist Nancy Faust who picked up on spontaneous chants of fans who were singing tunes like, &quot;We will, we will, SOX YOU!&quot; and popularized the now-ubiquitous farewell to departing pitchers and ejected managers, &quot;Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey-hey, GOOD-BYE!&quot;

Before he became an institution on the north side with the Cubs, Sox broadcaster Harry Caray was a south side icon. At some point he started &quot;conducting&quot; Take Me Out to the Ball Game during the seventh-inning stretch, egged on by Veeck, who (according to Harry himself) said that the fans would sing along when they realized that none of them sang any worse than Harry did; Caray would take this tradition with him to the Cubs at Wrigley Field, which has continued even with Caray&#x27;s death in 1998. Harry would sometimes broadcast from the center field bleachers, where he could hobnob with fans and get a suntan (or a burn).

The largest crowd at Old Comiskey Park was in 1973 with a crowd of 55,555 (which was 11,063 over capacity) on May 20 for a doubleheader against the Minnesota Twins, which also had the promotion of &quot;Bat Day&quot;. By contrast, just over two years earlier, the smallest attendance at the park was recorded, with 511 spectators attending a game against the Boston Red Sox on Thursday, May 6, 1971.

===Disco Demolition Night===

A major and oft-mentioned promotional event held at Old Comiskey was &quot;Disco Demolition Night&quot; in 1979, organized by longtime Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl and White Sox promotions manager Mike Veeck (Bill&#x27;s son) on Thursday, July 12. Between games of a make-up doubleheader between the White Sox and the Detroit Tigers, Dahl and his crew destroyed a pile of disco records that fans had brought in exchange for a ticket with a discounted price of 98¢ in honor of Dahl&#x27;s station at that time, WLUP-FM, the frequency of which was 97.9 MHz (98 FM). More than 50,000 fans were in attendance, along with another 20,000 who crashed the gates even though the game was sold out. The demolition tore a huge hole in center field and several thousand fans, many of them intoxicated, stormed the field, stole equipment, and destroyed the infield. The nightcap was postponed, but league officials ruled it a forfeit the next day, the fourth in American League history, all in the 1970s. Later, some blamed Dahl; some blamed Veeck. Howard Cosell even blamed then-White Sox announcer Harry Caray, saying Caray contributed to a &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere. In reality, a handful of rowdies had taken advantage of a situation for which stadium security was woefully unprepared. &quot;I never thought that I, a stupid disc jockey, could draw 70,000 people to a disco demolition,&quot; Dahl said in a &quot;Tribune&quot; interview. &quot;Unfortunately, some of our followers got a little carried away.&quot; That was the last anti-disco rally for WLUP. But it brought Dahl national attention and established him as a radio superstar in Chicago.

==Transitions==
When Bill Veeck re-acquired the team, he took out the center field fence, reverting to the original distance to the wall (posted as 440 in the 1940s, re-measured as 445 in the 1970s) ... a tough target, but reachable by sluggers like Oscar Gamble and Richie Zisk and other members of a team that was tagged &quot;The South Side Hit Men&quot;. They were long removed from their days as &quot;The Hitless Wonders&quot;. During that time the ballpark also featured a lounge where one could buy mixed drinks. This prompted some writers to dub Comiskey &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Largest Outdoor Saloon&quot;.

==Final years==

In 1969, AstroTurf was installed in the infield and the adjacent foul territory, with the outfield and adjoining foul territory remaining as natural grass. It was the first outdoor field in the major leagues to install artificial turf. After seven seasons, the artificial turf was removed prior to the 1976 season.

During its last eight years, Comiskey&#x27;s annual attendance surpassed the two million mark three times, including the final season when the Sox contended for much of the year before losing the western division title to the Oakland Athletics.

White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf received more than $200 million in public financing for the new stadium after threatening to move the club to St. Petersburg, Florida (a similar threat was later used by the San Francisco Giants until they broke ground on what would be their current ballpark in late 1997). An interesting phenomenon occurred in the Illinois state legislature, in that the Speaker (Michael Madigan) stopped the clock on the evening of June 30, 1988, so that the legislature could report that the money had been granted on June 30, and not July 1. The stadium now called Tropicana Field was constructed by officials in St. Petersburg in an effort to lure a Major League Baseball club to Florida (which arrived in 1998 in the form of the expansion Devil Rays), but Miami beat the Tampa Bay area to the punch when it launched the expansion Florida Marlins in 1993. The deal was sealed in a last-minute legislative maneuver by then-governor James R. Thompson.

On September 30, 1990, with 42,849 in paid attendance, the Chicago White Sox played the last game at Comiskey Park, defeating the Seattle Mariners 2–1. Mayor Richard M. Daley (a lifelong White Sox fan) threw out the opening pitch, legendary Sox player Minnie Miñoso delivered the lineup card to the umpires, and well-known ball-park organist Nancy Faust played for the crowd during the final game. Also, former White Sox Vice President Charles Comiskey, grandson of the man for whom the park was named, was on hand. The final play occurred when White Sox closer Bobby Thigpen forced Mariners&#x27; second baseman Harold Reynolds to hit a grounder to second baseman Scott Fletcher, who in return threw it to first baseman Steve Lyons for the force-out. The crowd then joined the organist by singing a final rendition of their unofficial victory song &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;.

Comiskey Park was demolished in 1991; starting from behind the right field corner, the process took all summer to complete. The last portion to come down was the center field bleachers and the &quot;exploding&quot; scoreboard. The site of the old park was turned into a parking lot to serve those attending games at the new Comiskey Park (later renamed &quot;U.S. Cellular Field&quot;, now Rate Field).

At the time Comiskey was demolished, Chicago&#x27;s two baseball stadiums were a combined 157 years old.

Bill Veeck once remarked that &quot;There is no more beautiful sight in the world than a ballpark full of people!&quot; On its best days, Comiskey was stuffed to the gills, with 55,000 people or more lining the aisles and even standing for 9 (or 18) innings on the sloping ramps that criss-crossed behind the scoreboard. The nearly-fully enclosed stands had a way of capturing and reverberating the noise without any artificial enhancement. Chicago sportswriter Alan Solomon remarked in 1988 that growing up in Chicago, &quot;Wrigley Field &quot;yayed&quot; and Comiskey Park &quot;roared&quot;.

The location of Comiskey Park&#x27;s home plate is marked with a marble plaque near the parking lot across the street from Rate Field; foul lines for the old park are painted on the lot&#x27;s asphalt. Based on Google Maps measurements, the old home plate is 503 feet due north of the current home plate at Rate Field. Also, the spectator ramp across 35th Street is designed in such a way (partly curved, partly straight but angling east-northeast) that it echoes the outline of part of the old grandstand.

Shortly before the park&#x27;s demolition, the ballpark was featured in the movie &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;. John Candy&#x27;s character (on a first date) arranged to have a private picnic on the stadium grass under the lights with his date (Ally Sheedy). Candy made a reference of the stadium&#x27;s impending demolition during the date.

When the Sox won the 2005 World Series, their victory parade began at U.S. Cellular Field, and then circled the block where old Comiskey had stood, before heading on a route through various south side neighborhoods and toward downtown Chicago.

==Nicholson home run==
On May 6, 1964, White Sox outfielder Dave Nicholson hit a home run that either bounced atop the left-field roof or entirely cleared it. The home run was officially measured at 573 feet, and is one of baseball&#x27;s all-time longest.

<text>The Canadian federal budget of 2004 was a budget for the Government of Canada. It was read in the House of Commons of Canada on March 23, 2004, by Finance Minister Ralph Goodale of the governing Liberal Party. It was prepared by Goodale with significant input from Prime Minister Paul Martin, who had previously served as Minister of Finance in the government of Jean Chrétien.

The budget contained few surprises: most major initiatives had been announced long beforehand. These included $2 billion for health care, money for municipalities, and $1 billion to help livestock farmers harmed by the Mad Cow crisis. Government spending was set to increase at the same rate as Gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years with any surplus going to pay down the national debt.

== Taxes ==
=== Personal income taxes ===
* The Education Tax Credit is extended to individuals pursuing post-secondary education that is related to their current employment (if not already reimbursed by the employer);
* The budget allows caregivers to claim the Medical Expense Tax Credit on expenses made on the behalf of dependent relatives.
* Enhancement of the Canada Education Savings Grant: matching contribution rate is enhanced for the first $500 of contributions made by low-income families;
* Creation of the Canada Learning Bond, effective 1 January 2004 for children born on or after that date. The grant of up to $2,000 (over the child&#x27;s lifetime) is available for families entitled to the National Child Benefit.

=== Corporate income taxes ===
* Increase in the small business deduction limit: the small business deduction (SBD) limit is increased to $300,000 in 2005 and subsequent years instead of $275,000. The SBD limit was gradually increased in the 2003 Canadian federal budget and at the time was supposed to reach $300,000 in 2006;
* Non-capital losses carry-forward extended to 10 years: the budget extends the loss carry-forward period from 7 to 10 years for non-capital losses.
* Faster depreciation of computer equipment: for computer equipment acquired after 22 March 2004, the CCA rate is increased from 30% to 45%. The separate class election for computer is however terminated for equipment acquired on or after 1 January 2005;
* Extension of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit: the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, a temporary tax credit created by the 2000 Canadian federal budget and set to expire on 31 December 2004 per the 2003 Canadian federal budget is extended through 31 December 2005.

==Expenditures==

== Reactions ==
=== Opposition parties ===
The budget was criticized by the Conservative Party for its lack of tax cuts and its increases in spending. The New Democratic Party criticized the policy of debt reduction, arguing that social spending, especially on health care, would be more beneficial.

== Legislative process ==
Before the budget could be passed, parliament was dissolved for the 2004 election. The budget legislation was appended to the 2005 budget that was passed the next year.

<text>The relatively small (75 cm high) limestone Cretan sculpture called the Lady of Auxerre (or Kore of Auxerre), held at the Louvre Museum in Paris, depicts an archaic Greek goddess of 650 - 625 BCE. It is a &quot;Kore&quot; (&quot;maiden&quot;), perhaps a votary rather than the maiden Goddess Persephone herself, for her right hand touches her solar plexus and her left remains stiffly at her side (Basel 2001). It is also possible that the Kore is a depiction of a deceased individual, possibly in a position of prayer.

== History ==
Maxime Collignon, a Louvre curator, found the sculpture in a storage vault in the Museum of Auxerre, a city east of Paris, in 1907. No provenance is known, and its mysterious arrival at a provincial French museum gave it a journalistic allure, according to the Louvre monograph. The sculpture has been the subject of scholarly debate over what regional school of early Greek art it belongs to but is generally considered a Cretan work.

The Archaic sculpture, bearing traces of polychrome decoration, dates from the 7th century BCE, when Greece was emerging from its Dark Age. She still has the narrow waist of a Minoan-Mycenaean goddess, and her stiff hair suggests Egyptian influence. The Early Archaic style has been fancifully termed &quot;Daedalic.&quot; Its secret, knowing and serene hint of a smile is often characterized as the &quot;archaic smile.&quot; Sculptures and painted vases exhibiting correlative styles have been found outside Crete as well as in Rhodes, Corinth and Sparta (Basel 2000).
Excavations in the 1990s by Nikolaos Stampolidis at Eleutherna in Crete have helped establish more precisely a date and place of origin for the &quot;Dame d&#x27;Auxerre&quot;, in the region of Eleutherna and Gortyn, with the recovery from gravesites of very similar carved ivory faces and phallic symbols.

== Description ==
The figure and its quadrangular base are carved from the same piece of limestone, making the figure and its base one piece. Her hair and costume are both modeled and incised. She wears a wide tubular dress, either a closed peplos or a woolen chiton, with a broad belt and an epiblema, or possibly the material of the back part of the dress brought forward, covering her shoulders. The dress appears neither sewn nor buttoned along the upper arms but may convey a garment that it is pinned in the front by a pair of brooches concealed by her hair.

The horizontal band crossing her chest has incised maeanders that create a scaled design. Similar designs border the garment around her shoulders. The skirt of her garment bears a vertical panel of an incised pattern in the front and is circled at the bottom by a similar incised pattern. The various incised patterns on the statue are difficult to construe with the absence of paint, but painted casts such as the one in the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge have attempted to interpret them through the application of color. The cast at Cambridge interprets the incisions at her wrists as bracelets.

Her hair is arranged in Daedalic fashion, divided horizontally into six tresses at the back, ending in knobs, and similarly sculpted into four tresses placed on either side of the face in the front. The portion of hair between the back and side is also divided horizontally. A row of spiral curls forms her bangs. Her feet, which protrude from the bottom of her garment, are flat, the toes being parallel to each other and forming a continuous curve. Her flat, elongated fingers are also parallel to each other, the pinkie being almost as long as and the thumb being much smaller than the other fingers. Her preserved right eyebrow is prominently incised on her low forehead and her preserved right eye is carefully carved. The upper eyelid protrudes more than the lower one. Her lips are broad and do not meet at the corners of her mouth. Her chin is also very prominent and dished. Some scholars have interpreted the flatness of the lower body in comparison to the modeling of the face, torso, and arms as a result of the material and technique of the time, attributing this quality to the inexperience of the artist forcing them to rely on geometric shapes to describe the form. However, this quality has also been considered intentional on the artist’s part to fit into the aesthetic norms of the period and culture.

<doc id="548100" wikidata="Q7435336" url="?curid=548100" title="Scoresby, Victoria">
<text>Scoresby is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 29 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox local government area. Scoresby recorded a population of 6,066 at the 2021 census.

In the Parish system of Victoria (mainly used with land-ownership documents) the local parish is called Scoresby, a part of the County of Mornington.

==History==

The area of Scoresby was surveyed in 1857, and named after the Arctic explorer William Scoresby. Scoresby had died the previous year, shortly after his visit to the colony to experiment with terrestrial magnetism near the area which now carries his name. A township developed in the 1870s around the intersection of Stud Road and Ferntree Gully Road. A school was established in 1872, followed by a Methodist church. Once the swampy ground was drained, market gardens were established. Scoresby Post Office opened on 20 January 1890, closed in 1979 and reopened in 1984 as the suburb grew.

Following the First World War, George Hodges Knox settled and established an orchard in Scoresby. He later became a member of Parliament, and was knighted. The City of Knox is named after him.

During the 1950s, the market garden industry grew. Scoresby became the Brussels sprout capital of Victoria. In 1959, subdivision of the market gardens began.

==Present day==

Scoresby contains a number of extensive industrial estates which are home to a variety of major national and international corporations including Nintendo&#x27;s Australian headquarters.

Caribbean Gardens, an entertainment precinct and market, is open every Wednesday and Sunday. The precinct is centred on Caribbean Lake, which was built for the testing of boats by the boat manufacturer Caribbean Boats. Activities at Caribbean Gardens include buying and selling of all kinds of products, eating, drinking, walking around, music played by bands and computer swap meets. The market and site closed in 2020 due to COVID. Another popular &quot;Caribbean&quot; place in Scoresby is Caribbean Roller Skating. 

Scoresby village is the main shopping precinct in Scoresby. It includes a supermarket and many other small stores, hair dressers and other services. These stores are arranged around a central carpark with the local football field behind.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in the area, state school Scoresby Primary School and private school (St. Judes). The secondary education provider in Scoresby is Scoresby Secondary College.

==Climate==
Scoresby has a weather station which collects data for the Bureau of Meteorology. It commenced readings in 1948 and is situated at Latitude 37.87°S and Longitude 145.26°E at an elevation of 80m above sea level. The site name is the Scoresby Research Institute and its site number is 086104, however it is not actually based in Scoresby, but in the suburb of Knoxfield. Hourly weather observations taken from Scoresby can be viewed from the Bureau of Meteorology website.

Scoresby has an oceanic climate with certain subtropical influences similar to the rest of the Greater Melbourne area. It is wetter than Melbourne CBD and the suburbs to the north due to the &quot;bay effect&quot; set up by Port Phillip to the east, where showers are intensified leeward of the bay.

==Sport==

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, The Scoresby Magpies, competing in the Eastern Football League.

Scoresby Cricket Club is also located in the suburb of Scoresby, competing in the Ferntree Gully &amp; District Cricket Association, and play their home games out of Scoresby Recreation Reserve. The Club currently fields numerous senior,junior (boys and girls) and veterans teams, with the 1st XI playing in Alan Bailey Shield.

<text>Experimental economics is the application of experimental methods to study economic questions. Data collected in experiments are used to estimate effect size, test the validity of economic theories, and illuminate market mechanisms. Economic experiments usually use cash to motivate subjects, in order to mimic real-world incentives. Experiments are used to help understand how and why markets and other exchange systems function as they do. Experimental economics have also expanded to understand institutions and the law (experimental law and economics).

A fundamental aspect of the subject is design of experiments. Experiments may be conducted in the field or in laboratory settings, whether of individual or group behavior.

Variants of the subject outside such formal confines include natural and quasi-natural experiments.

==Experimental topics==
One can loosely classify economic experiments using the following topics:
* Markets
* Games
* Evolutionary game theory
* Decision making
* Bargaining
* Contracts
* Auctions
* Coordination
* Social Preferences
* Learning
* Matching
* Field Experiments, most usually associated with John A. List, who pioneered the use of field experiments in the early 1990s. 

Within economics education, one application involves experiments used in the teaching of economics. An alternative approach with experimental dimensions is agent-based computational modeling. It is important to consider the potential and constraints of games for understanding rational behavior and solving human conflict.

===Coordination games===
Coordination games are games with multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria. There are two general sets of questions that experimental economists typically ask when examining such games: (1) Can laboratory subjects coordinate, or learn to coordinate, on one of multiple equilibria, and if so are there general principles that can help predict which equilibrium is likely to be chosen? (2) Can laboratory subjects coordinate, or learn to coordinate, on the Pareto best equilibrium and if not, are there conditions or mechanisms which would help subjects coordinate on the Pareto best equilibrium? Deductive selection principles are those that allow predictions based on the properties of the game alone. Inductive selection principles are those that allow predictions based on characterizations of dynamics. Under some conditions at least groups of experimental subjects can coordinate even complex non-obvious asymmetric Pareto-best equilibria. This is even though all subjects decide simultaneously and independently without communication. The way by which this happens is not yet fully understood.

===Learning experiments===

Economic theories often assume that economic incentives can shape behavior even when individual agents have limited understanding of the environment. The relationship between economic incentives and outcomes may be indirect: The economic incentives determine the agents’ experience, and these experiences may then drive future actions.

Learning experiments can be classified as individual choice tasks or games, where games typically refer to strategic interactions of two or more players. Oftentimes, the general patterns of learning behavior can be best illustrated with individual choice tasks.

In games of two players or more, the subjects often form beliefs about what actions the other subjects are taking and these beliefs are updated over time. This is known as belief learning. Subjects also tend to make the same decisions that have rewarded them with high payoffs in the past. This is known as reinforcement learning.

Until the 1990s, simple adaptive models, such as Cournot competition or fictitious play, were generally used. In the mid-1990s, Alvin E. Roth and Ido Erev demonstrated that reinforcement learning can make useful predictions in experimental games. In 1999, Colin Camerer and Teck-Hua Ho introduced Experience Weighted Attraction (EWA), a general model that incorporated reinforcement and belief learning, and shows that fictitious play is mathematically equivalent to generalized reinforcement, provided weights are placed on past history.

Criticisms of EWA include overfitting due to many parameters, lack of generality over games, and the possibility that the interpretation of EWA parameters may be difficult. Overfitting is addressed by estimating parameters on some of the experimental periods or experimental subjects and forecasting behavior in the remaining sample (if models are overfitting, these out-of-sample validation forecasts will be much less accurate than in-sample fits, which they generally are not). Generality in games is addressed by replacing fixed parameters with &quot;self-tuning&quot; functions of experience, allowing pseudo-parameters to change over the course of a game and to also vary systematically across games.

Modern experimental economists have done much notable work recently. Roberto Weber has raised issues of learning without feedback. David Cooper and John Kagel have investigated types of learning over similar strategies. Ido Erev and Greg Barron have looked at learning in cognitive strategies. Dale Stahl has characterized learning over decision making rules. Charles A. Holt has studied logit learning in different kinds of games, including games with multiple equilibria. Wilfred Amaldoss has looked at interesting applications of EWA in marketing. Amnon Rapoport, Jim Parco and Ryan Murphy have investigated reinforcement-based adaptive learning models in one of the most celebrated paradoxes in game theory known as the centipede game.

===Market games===
Edward Chamberlin is thought to have conducted &quot;not only the first market experiment, but also the first economic experiment of any kind.&quot; Vernon Smith, drawing on Chamberlin&#x27;s work, but also modifying it in key respects, conducted pioneering economics experiments on the convergence of prices and quantities to their theoretical competitive equilibrium values in experimental markets. Smith studied the behavior of &quot;buyers&quot; and &quot;sellers&quot;, who are told how much they &quot;value&quot; a fictitious commodity and then are asked to competitively &quot;bid&quot; or &quot;ask&quot; on these commodities following the rules of various real world market institutions (e.g., the Double auction as well the English and Dutch auctions). Smith found that in some forms of centralized trading, prices and quantities traded in such markets converge on the values that would be predicted by the economic theory of perfect competition, despite the conditions not meeting many of the assumptions of perfect competition (large numbers, perfect information).

Over the years, Smith pioneered – along with other collaborators – the use of controlled laboratory experiments in economics, and established it as a legitimate tool in economics and other related fields. Charles Plott of the California Institute of Technology collaborated with Smith in the 1970s and pioneered experiments in political science, as well as using experiments to inform economic design or engineering to inform policies. In 2002, Smith was awarded (jointly with Daniel Kahneman) the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences &quot;for having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms&quot;.

===Finance===
Experimental finance studies financial markets with the goals of establishing different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and analyze agents&#x27; behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanism and returns processes. Presently, researchers use simulation software to conduct their research.

For instance, experiments have manipulated information asymmetry about the holding value of a bond or a share on the pricing for those who don&#x27;t have enough information, in order to study stock market bubbles.

===Social preferences===

The term &quot;social preferences&quot; refers to the concern (or lack thereof) that people have for each other&#x27;s well-being, and it encompasses altruism, spitefulness, tastes for equality, and tastes for reciprocity. Experiments on social preferences generally study economic games including the dictator game, the ultimatum game, the trust game, the gift-exchange game, the public goods game, and modifications to these canonical settings.
As one example of results, ultimatum game experiments have shown that people are generally willing to sacrifice monetary rewards when offered low allocations, thus behaving inconsistently with simple models of self-interest. Economic experiments have measured how this deviation varies across cultures.

===Contracts===
Contract theory is concerned with providing incentives in situations in which some variables cannot be observed by all parties. Hence, contract theory is difficult to test in the field: If the researcher could verify the relevant variables, then the contractual parties could contract on these variables, hence any interesting contract-theoretic problem would disappear. Yet, in laboratory experiments it is possible to directly test contract-theoretic models. For instance, researchers have experimentally studied moral hazard theory, adverse selection theory, exclusive contracting, deferred compensation, the hold-up problem, flexible versus rigid contracts, and models with endogenous information structures.

===Agent-based computational modeling===
Agent-based computational modeling is a relatively recent method in economics with experimental dimensions. Here the focus is on economic processes, including whole economies, as dynamic systems of interacting agents, an application of the complex adaptive systems paradigm. The &quot;agent&quot; refers to &quot;computational objects modeled as interacting according to rules,&quot; not real people. Agents can represent social and/or physical entities. Starting from initial conditions determined by the modeler, an ACE model develops forward through time driven solely by agent interactions. Issues include those common to experimental economics in general and by comparison as well as development of a common framework for empirical validation and resolving open questions in agent-based modeling.

==Methodology==

===Guidelines===
Experimental economists generally adhere to the following methodological guidelines:
* Incentivize subjects with real monetary payoffs.
* Publish full experimental instructions.
* Do not use deception.
* Avoid introducing specific, concrete context.

===Critiques===
The above guidelines have developed in large part to address two central critiques. Specifically, economics experiments are often challenged because of concerns about their &quot;internal validity&quot; and &quot;external validity&quot;, for example, that they are not applicable models for many types of economic behavior, so the experiments simply aren&#x27;t good enough to produce useful answers. However, none of the critiques towards this methodology are specific to it, as they are immediately applicable to either theoretical or empirical approaches or both. 

==Software tools==

The most famous software for conducting experimental economics research is z-Tree, which is developed by Urs Fischbacher from 1998 on. It had about 9460 citation results counted on Google Scholar in February 2020. It transcripts as &quot;Zurich Toolbox for Readymade Economic Experiments&quot; and was one of the reasons for the Joachim Herz Research prize for &quot;Best research work&quot; awarded to Fischbacher in Dezember 2016.
z-Tree is a software, which runs on a network of computers in a research lab. One of the computers is used by experimenters and the other computers are used by the subjects of experiment. The setup of an experiment is variable and can be defined in the imperative language z-Tree programming language. This language allows the experimenter to set up a variety of experiments and additional surveys.

Alternatively, there is a big number of competing alternative software. Following table presents a growing list of software tools for experimental economics:

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the 20th century before 1949.

==Events==

===1900s===

====1901====
* June 8 — The first documented same-sex marriage in Spain in post-Roman times is performed. Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa Sanchez Loriga were married by a parish priest in A Coruña (Galicia), with Elisa using the male identity &quot;Mario Sánchez&quot;. The priest later discovered the deception but the marriage certificate was never officially voided.

====1907====
* German newspaper writer Maximillian Harden publicly outed the homosexuality of Prince Eulenburg, April 27, in the newspaper &quot;Die Zukunft&quot;, after previously outing General Kuno Grof von Moltke in 1906. Public trials followed, and, while neither were proven to have taken part on homosexual actions, both Eulenburg and Moltke lost their credibility and reputation.

===1910s===

====1912====
* November — Following his arrest in Portland, Oregon, for shoplifting, 19-year-old Benjamin Trout tells police that he was &quot;corrupted&quot; by adult men in the town. This news incites a moral panic which comes to be known as the Portland vice scandal. Dozens of men and boys are arrested on charges ranging from lewd behaviour to sodomy, and the state legislature responds by passing a law allowing for the forced sterilization of &quot;sexual perverts&quot;.
1913
* Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is published in France, marking the first time a modern Western author treats homosexuality openly in literature.

====1916====

* The United States military begins issuing blue discharges, a form of Military discharge that was neither honorable nor dishonorable. During World War II the blue discharge became the discharge of choice for commanders seeking to remove homosexuals from the ranks.

====1917====

* Following the Russian Revolution, the Bolshevik government abolishes the entirety of the Empire&#x27;s criminal code. This includes Article 995, which criminalized anal sex between males.

====1919====
* Magnus Hirschfeld founds the &quot;Institut für Sexualwissenschaft&quot;, a sexology research center, in Germany.
* February — an investigation into reports of homosexual activity among sailors in Newport, Rhode Island, results in a series of arrests, courts-martial and civilian criminal trials. Details of sailors ordered to act as sexual decoys led to political embarrassment for then-Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt.

===1920s===

====1920====
* May 23 — Harvard University establishes an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee to investigate homosexual activity at the school. Following two weeks of inquiries, Harvard expels several students. The tribunal becomes known as the &quot;Secret Court&quot; after records filed under that name are discovered in 2002.

====1921====
* The UK House of Commons votes to extend the Labouchere Amendment, which criminalizes sexual acts between males, to women. The House of Lords rejects the measure.

====1924====
* December 10 — The Society for Human Rights (SHR), the first LGBT rights organization in the United States, is founded by Henry Gerber and chartered by the state of Illinois. SHR published the first known American LGBT publication, &quot;Friendship and Freedom&quot;. The Society existed for only a few months before it collapsed in the wake of the arrests of Gerber and several Society members.

====1927====
* The New York Assembly amends the state&#x27;s obscenity code to ban the appearance or discussion of homosexuality on the public stage.

====1928====
* July 27 — &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; by Radclyffe Hall is published in England.
* November 9 — The obscenity trial for &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; begins. On the 16th, Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron declares the book obscene.

====1929====
* Section 171 of the Criminal Code of Cyprus is enacted as part of a new criminal code in the country, criminalizing homosexual acts between consenting male adults. It would be repealed in 1998.
* A committee of the Reichstag votes 15–13 to repeal Paragraph 175. However, in the wake of the worldwide Depression the full body never votes.

===1930s===

====1933====
* May 6 — Members of the Nazi Party sack the &quot;Institut für Sexualwissenschaft&quot;. A few days later they publicly burn the Institute&#x27;s archives.

====1934====
* January — The Soviet Union orchestrates mass arrests of homosexuals in Moscow and Leningrad.
* March — The Soviet Union criminalizes consensual sexual acts between adult males as a crime against the State. Conviction carries a penalty of five years&#x27; hard labor.

====1935====
* June 28 — The Nazis expand the language of Paragraph 175 to cover virtually any contact between men. Arrests under the expanded law skyrocket from under 1,000 in 1932 to over 8,500 in 1938.

====1936====
* The Nazis establish the Federal Security Department for Combating Abortion and Homosexuality.

====1938====
* A new Nazi directive allows for men convicted of gross indecency with another man to be sent directly to a concentration camp.

====1939====
* January 12 — The Georgia Supreme Court rules that &quot;The crime of sodomy as defined by statute cannot be accomplished between two women.&quot;

===1940s===

====1940====
* A new Nazi directive requires men arrested for homosexual activities with more than one partner be transferred to a concentration camp after completing his prison term.
* May — Psychiatrists Harry Stack Sullivan and Winfred Overholser formulate guidelines for the psychiatric screening of United States military inductees. While both believe homosexuals should not be inducted, their proposal does not explicitly exclude homosexuals.

====1941====
* May — The United States Army Surgeon General&#x27;s office issues a circular that for the first time classifies &quot;homosexual proclivities&quot; as disqualifying inductees for military service. Similar exclusive policies are adopted by the United States Navy and the Selective Service.
* December 21 – Aleister Crowley issues Liber OZ, stating that &quot;Man has the right to love as he will:— &quot;take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will.&quot; —AL. I. 51.

====1942====
* August 6 — The Vichy government introduced a discriminative law in penal code: article 334 (moved to article 331 on February 8, 1945, by the Provisional Government of the French Republic) increased the age of consent to 21 for homosexual relations and 15 for heterosexual ones.

====1943====
* Heinrich Himmler issues a directive that allows homosexuals to be released from concentration camps if they underwent castration. However, those who were released under this edict were sent to fight in the Dirlewanger Brigade, which for practical purposes was a death sentence.
* As Allied forces begin liberating Nazi concentration camps, some American and British jurists conclude that the camps did not technically constitute prisons. If a gay man had served part of a prison sentence for violating Paragraph 175, he could be returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. It is unknown how many men were returned to prison.

====1944====
* October — TB MED 100 establishes homosexuality as a reason for disqualifying recruits into the Women&#x27;s Army Corps.

====1945====
* The Veterans Administration institutes a policy of denying G.I. Bill benefits to veterans holding blue discharges, despite the explicit language of the Bill that the only discharge that disqualified a veteran was a dishonorable one. The VA renewed this directive in 1946 and 1949.
* Four honorably discharged gay World War II veterans found the Veterans Benevolent Association. Although primarily a social club, VBA formed in part in response to the sense of injustice that many gay veterans felt about being given blue discharges, with its attendant negative legal and societal connotations. VBA worked in coalition with Black and labor organizations against the arbitrary issuance of blue discharges.

====1946====
* January 30 — The House Committee on Military Affairs issues a report called &quot;Blue Discharges&quot;. The committee finds that the use of the blue discharge is discriminatory and singles out the VA for special criticism for denying blue discharge holders G.I. Bill benefits.

====1947====
* July 1 — Congress discontinues the blue discharge, replacing it with two new classifications, general and undesirable. At the same time, however, the Army changes its regulations to ensure that gay and lesbian service members would not qualify for general discharges.

====1948====
* Harry Hay conceives of the idea of a homosexual activist group. He develops this idea over the next two years, co-founding the Mattachine Society, the first sustained LGBT rights group in the United States, in 1950.
* Alfred Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research publish &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;, the first of two Kinsey Reports.

====1949====
* The Préfet de Paris issues a decree banning men from dancing together in public places.
* October — The newly consolidated United States Department of Defense standardizes anti-homosexual regulations across all branches of the military: &quot;Homosexual personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;

<doc id="548105" wikidata="Q43969" url="?curid=548105" title="Muhammad Yunus">
<text>Muhammad Yunus (born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi economist, businessman, and politician who has been serving as Chief Adviser of the Interim Government of Bangladesh since 8 August 2024. Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. Yunus has received several other national and international honors, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.

In 2012, Yunus became Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, a position he held until 2018. Previously, he was a professor of economics at Chittagong University in Bangladesh. He published several books related to his finance work. He is a founding board member of Grameen America and Grameen Foundation, which support microcredit. Yunus also served on the board of directors of the United Nations Foundation, a public charity to support UN causes, from 1998 to 2021. In 2022, he partnered with Global Esports Federation as part of the &quot;Esports for Development (E4D)&quot; movement to support the development of esports.

Following the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina, President Mohammed Shahabuddin gave Yunus a mandate to form an interim government, acceding to calls from student leaders for his appointment. His government has appointed a Constitutional Reform Commission to draft a revision to the Constitution of Bangladesh and has pledged the convocation of a constituent assembly. His name was listed in &quot;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&quot; in 2024.

==Early life and education==

===Early years===
The third of nine children, Muhammad Yunus was born on 28 June 1940 to a Bengali Muslim family of Saudagars in the village of Bathua, by the Kaptai road at Hathazari in the Chittagong District of Bengal Presidency (now in Bangladesh). His father was Haji Muhammad Dula Mia Soudagar, a jeweller, and his mother was Sufia Khatun. His early childhood was spent in the village. In 1944, his family moved to the city of Chittagong, and he moved from his village school to Lamabazar Primary School. By 1949, his mother was afflicted with psychological illness. Later, he passed the matriculation examination from Chittagong Collegiate School ranking 16th out of 39,000 students in East Pakistan. During his school years, he was an active Boy Scout, and travelled to West Pakistan and India in 1952, and to Canada in 1955 to attend Jamborees. Later, while Yunus was studying at Chittagong College, he became active in cultural activities and won awards for drama. In 1957, he enrolled in the Department of Economics at Dhaka University and completed his BA in 1960 and MA in 1961.

===After graduation===
After his graduation, Yunus joined the Bureau of Economics at Dhaka University as a research assistant to economists Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan. Later, he was appointed lecturer in economics in Chittagong College in 1961. During that time, he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side. In 1965, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States. He obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University Graduate Program in Economic Development (GPED) in 1971. From 1969 to 1972, Yunus was the assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro.

During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Yunus founded a citizen&#x27;s committee and ran the Bangladesh Information Center, with other Bangladeshis in the United States, to raise support for liberation. He also published the &quot;Bangladesh Newsletter&quot; from his home in Nashville. After the War, he returned to Bangladesh and was appointed to the government&#x27;s Planning Commission headed by Nurul Islam. However, he found the job boring and resigned to join Chittagong University as head of the Economics department. After observing the famine of 1974, he became involved in poverty reduction and established a rural economic programme as a research project. In 1975, he developed a &quot;Nabajug Tebhaga Khamar&quot; () which the government adopted as the Packaged Input Programme. To make the project more effective, Yunus and his associates proposed the &quot;Gram Sarkar&quot; () programme. Introduced by President Ziaur Rahman in the late 1970s, the government formed 40,392 village governments as a fourth layer of government in 2003. On 2 August 2005, in response to a petition by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST), the High Court declared village governments illegal and unconstitutional.

His concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries also inspired programmes such as the Info lady Social Entrepreneurship Programme.

==Early career==


In 1976, during visits to the poorest households in the village of Jobra near Chittagong University, Yunus discovered that very small loans could make a disproportionate difference to a poor person. Village women who made bamboo furniture had to take usurious loans to buy bamboo, and repay their profits to the lenders. Traditional banks did not want to make tiny loans at reasonable interest to the poor due to high risk of default. But Yunus believed that, given the chance, the poor will not need to pay high interest on the money, can keep any profits from their own labour, and hence microcredit was a viable business model. Yunus lent US$27 of his money to 42 women in the village, who made a profit of BDT 0.50 (US$0.02) each on the loan. Thus, Yunus is credited with the idea of microcredit.

In December 1976, Yunus finally secured a loan from the government Janata Bank to lend to the poor in Jobra. The institution continued to operate, securing loans from other banks for its projects. By 1982, it had 28,000 members. On 1 October 1983, the pilot project began operation as a full-fledged bank for poor Bangladeshis and was renamed Grameen Bank (&quot;Village Bank&quot;). By July 2007, Grameen had issued US$6.38 billion to 7.4 million borrowers. To ensure repayment, the bank uses a system of &quot;solidarity groups&quot;. These small informal groups apply together for loans and its members act as co-guarantors of repayment and support one another&#x27;s efforts at economic self-advancement.

In the late 1980s, Grameen started to diversify by attending to underutilized fishing ponds and irrigation pumps like deep tube wells. In 1989, these diversified interests started growing into separate organisations. The fisheries project became Grameen Motsho (&quot;Grameen Fisheries Foundation&quot;) and the irrigation project became Grameen Krishi (&quot;Grameen Agriculture Foundation&quot;). In time, the Grameen initiative grew into a multi-faceted group of profitable and non-profit ventures, including major projects like Grameen Trust and Grameen Fund, which runs equity projects like Grameen Software Limited, Grameen CyberNet Limited, and Grameen Knitwear Limited, as well as Grameen Telecom, which has a stake in Grameenphone (GP), the biggest private phone company in Bangladesh. From its start in March 1997 to 2007, GP&#x27;s Village Phone (&quot;Polli Phone&quot;) project had brought cell-phone ownership to 260,000 rural poor in over 50,000 villages.
The success of the Grameen microfinance model inspired similar efforts in about 100 developing countries and even in developed countries including the United States. Many microcredit projects retain Grameen&#x27;s emphasis of lending to women. More than 94% of Grameen loans have gone to women, who suffer disproportionately from poverty and who are more likely than men to devote their earnings to their families.

For his work with Grameen, Yunus was named an Global Academy Member in 2001. According to Rashidul Bari, the Grameen&#x27;s social business model has gone from being theory to an inspiring practice adopted globally by leading universities, entrepreneurs, social business and corporations.

==Political career==
In July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Graça Machel and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders &quot;to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world&#x27;s toughest problems.&quot; Nelson Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. Yunus attended the launch of the group and was one of its founding members. He stepped down as an Elder in September 2009, stating that he was unable to do justice to his membership due to the demands of his work.

Yunus is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. Every year, the Panel releases a report, the Africa Progress Report, that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies.
In July 2009, Yunus became a member of the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation International Advisory Board to support the organisation&#x27;s poverty reduction work.
Since 2010, Yunus has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, a UN initiative which seeks to use broadband internet services to accelerate social and economic development.
In March 2016, he was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, which was co-chaired by presidents François Hollande of France and Jacob Zuma of South Africa. Following the Rohingya genocide in 2016–2017, Yunus urged Myanmar to end violence against Rohingya Muslims.

=== Advisor to the Caretaker Government ===
In 1996, Muhammad Yunus served as an advisor to the caretaker government led by former Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman. He was responsible for overseeing the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
===Nagorik Shakti===

In early 2006, Yunus, along with other members of the civil society including Rehman Sobhan, Muhammad Habibur Rahman, Kamal Hossain, Matiur Rahman, Mahfuz Anam and Debapriya Bhattacharya, participated in a campaign for honest and clean candidates in national elections. He considered entering politics in the later part of that year. On 11 February 2007, Yunus wrote an open letter, published in the Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star, where he asked citizens for views on his plan to float a political party to establish political goodwill, proper leadership and good governance. In the letter, he called on everyone to briefly outline how he should go about the task and how they can contribute to it. Yunus finally announced that he is willing to launch a political party tentatively called Nagorik Shakti () on 18 February 2007. There was speculation that the army supported a move by Yunus into politics. On 3 May, however, Yunus declared that he had decided to abandon his political plans following a meeting with the head of the caretaker government, Fakhruddin Ahmed.
===Chief Adviser of Bangladesh===

Amid the Student–People&#x27;s uprising in Bangladesh, Yunus expressed support for the students and his distaste of the current government, and in August 2024, after the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and her departure to India, it was announced that Yunus would be chief adviser of the interim government.

Muhammad Yunus was appointed as the transitional leader of the interim government on 7 August 2024 by president Mohammed Shahabuddin. On 8 August 2024, he took the oath and has been serving as the Chief Advisor of the interim government. After the oath, he visited injured people in Dhaka Medical College. On 10 August 2024, he visited the home and family members of Abu Sayed. He also visited injured student protesters in the Rangpur Medical College. Following communal violence after Hasina&#x27;s resignation, Yunus threatened to resign if the violence continued and vowed to crack down on conspirators of the attacks.

As Chief Adviser, Yunus has pledged to continue providing humanitarian aid to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and support the garment industry amid disruptions caused by the unrest prior to his appointment.
On 16 December 2024, Yunus announced that general elections would be held in late 2025 or early 2026.

==Controversies==
=== 2011 dismissal ===
The second Awami League government announced a review of Grameen Bank activities on 11 January 2011. In February 2011, several international leaders, such as Mary Robinson, stepped up their defence of Yunus through a number of efforts, including the founding of a formal network of supporters known as &quot;Friends of Grameen&quot;.

On 15 February 2011, the Finance Minister of Bangladesh, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, declared that Yunus should &quot;stay away&quot; from Grameen Bank while it is being investigated. On 2 March 2011, Muzammel Huq, a former Bank employee, whom the government had appointed chairman in January, announced that Yunus had been fired as managing director of the Bank. However, Bank General Manager Jannat-E Quanine issued a statement that Yunus was &quot;continuing in his office&quot; pending review of the legal issues surrounding the controversy.

In March 2011, Yunus petitioned the Bangladesh High Court challenging the legality of the decision by the Bangladeshi Central Bank to remove him as managing director of Grameen Bank. The same day, nine elected directors of Grameen Bank filed a second petition. U.S. Senator John Kerry expressed his support to Yunus in a statement on 5 March 2011 and declared that he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by this affair. The same day in Bangladesh, thousands of people protested and formed human chains to support Yunus. The High Court hearing on the petitions, was planned for 6 March 2011 but postponed. On 8 March 2011, the Court confirmed Yunus&#x27;s dismissal.

===Accusation of &#x27;loan sharking&#x27; and effectiveness of microfinance===

The allegations against Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank were made in a context where some people began to question the effectiveness of microfinance, prompted by the actions of some for-profit microfinance institutions (MFIs) in India and Mexico. Coercion, peer pressure and physical harassment were reportedly used as loan repayment practices in some specific MFIs. Commercialisation of microcredit prompted Yunus to state that he &quot;never imagined that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks.&quot;

The lure of profits attracted some for-profit MFIs to hold initial public offerings (IPOs), including the largest Indian MFI, SKS Microfinance, which held an IPO in July 2010. In September 2010, Yunus criticised the IPO; in a debate with SKS founder Vikram Akula during the Clinton Global Initiative meeting, he said, &quot;Microcredit is not about exciting people to make money off the poor. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing. That&#x27;s the wrong message completely.&quot; Calculations of actual interest rate vary, but one estimate puts average Grameen rates at about a 23% interest rate (comparable to the inflation rate). Also see what annual interest do NGOs earn from a fixed initial capital?

===Political motivations behind the allegations===
In December 2010, Grameen Bank was quickly cleared by the Norwegian government of all allegations surrounding misused or misappropriated funds. Yet, in March 2011, the Bangladeshi government launched a three-month investigation of all Grameen Bank&#x27;s activities. This inquiry prevented Muhammad Yunus from participating in the World Economic Forum.

In January 2011, Yunus appeared in court in a defamation case filed by a local politician from a minor left-leaning party in 2007, complaining about a statement that Yunus made to the AFP news agency, &quot;Politicians in Bangladesh only work for power. There is no ideology here&quot;. At the hearing, Yunus was granted bail and exempted from personal appearance at subsequent hearings.

These investigations fueled suspicion that many attacks might be politically motivated, due to difficult relations between Sheikh Hasina and Yunus since early 2007, when Yunus created his own political party, an effort he dropped in May 2007. In 2013, he faced a state-backed smear campaign that accused him of being un-Islamic and promoting homosexuality, after he signed a joint statement criticising the prosecution of gay people in Uganda in 2012 with three other nobel laureates.

=== Food adulteration case ===
On 27 January 2011, Yunus appeared in court in a food-adulteration case filed by the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) Food Safety Court, accusing him of producing an &quot;adulterated&quot; yogurt whose fat content was below the legal minimum. This yogurt is produced by Grameen Danone, a social business joint venture between Grameen Bank and Danone that aims to provide opportunities for street vendors who sell the yogurt and to improve child nutrition with the nutrient-fortified yogurt. According to Yunus&#x27; lawyer, the allegations are &quot;false and baseless&quot;.

===Trials===
Yunus faced 174 lawsuits in Bangladesh, 172 of which were civil cases. Allegations included labour law violations, corruption, and money laundering, which Yunus alleged were politically motivated.

Hasina launched a series of trials against Yunus. The former put the latter on trial in 2010 and ultimately removed him from Grameen Bank, citing his age. In 2013, he was tried a second time, because he had supposedly received earnings without the necessary government permission, including his Nobel Peace Prize earnings and royalties from his book sales. The series of trials against Yunus puzzled figures worldwide, from the 8.3 million underprivileged women served by Grameen Bank to U.S. President Barack Obama.

Vikas Bajaj wrote on 7 November 2013:

The government of Bangladesh has played its trump card in its long-running campaign against Grameen Bank and its founder Muhammad Yunus. Last week, legislators passed a law that effectively nationalizes the bank, which pioneered the idea of making small loans to poor women, by wresting control of it from the 8.4 million rural women that own a majority of its shares.

On 1 January 2024, a court in Bangladesh sentenced Yunus to a six-month prison term, along with three employees from Grameen Telecom for labor law violations. However, the court granted bail pending appeals. Amnesty International declared Yunus&#x27;s conviction a &quot;blatant abuse&quot; of the justice system. The conviction was overturned on 7 August 2024 following an appeal. He has been acquitted in a graft case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) just four days after getting acquittal for the labour violations case.

===Background===
For many years, Yunus remained a follower of Hasina&#x27;s father, Sheikh Mujib, the country&#x27;s founding father. While teaching at Middle Tennessee State University, Yunus founded the Bangladesh Citizens&#x27; Committee (BCC) as a response to West Pakistan&#x27;s aggression against Bangladesh. After the outbreak of the war of liberation, the BCC selected Yunus to become editor of its &quot;Bangladesh News Letter&quot;. Inspired by the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, Yunus returned home in 1972. The relationship continued after Mujib&#x27;s death. Yunus maintained a professional relationship with Hasina. Yunus appointed Hasina—along with U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton—as co-chair of a microcredit summit held 2–4 February 1997. At this event, 50 heads of state and high-level officials from 137 nations gathered in Washington, DC, to discuss solutions to poverty. At this event, Hasina had nothing but praise for Yunus. In her statement she praised, &quot;the outstanding work done by Professor Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded. ... The success of the Grameen Bank has created optimism about the viability of banks engaged in extending micro-credit to the poor&quot;. The inaugural ceremony of Grameen Phone, Bangladesh&#x27;s largest telephone service, took place at Hasina&#x27;s office on 26 March 1997. Using Grameen Phone, Hasina made the first call to Thorbjorn Jagland, the then-Norwegian prime minister. When her conversation ended, she received another call, from Laily Begum, a Grameen Phone employee. However, this long relationship ended in 2007 after Yunus disclosed his intention to form a political party, Nagorik Shakti.

===Change of Hasina&#x27;s opinion about Yunus===
The Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina campaigned against Grameen and Yunus. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Her actions appear to be retaliation for Mr. Yunus&#x27;s announcement in 2007 that he would seek public office, even though he never went through with his plans&quot;. According to &quot;Times of India&quot;, one other factor contributed to her decision against Yunus: the Nobel Peace Prize.

Hasina thought she would win the Nobel Peace Prize for signing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts peace treaty. On 9 March, Attorney General Mahbubey Alam expressed the government&#x27;s attitude when he said, &quot;Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;. He went on to challenge the wisdom of the Nobel committee.

===Historical description===

On 11 January 2007, Army General Moeen U Ahmed staged a military coup. Meanwhile, Yunus turned down his request to become the nation&#x27;s fourth Chief Advisor after Khaleda Zia&#x27;s term ended. Yunus, however, suggested the general pick Fakhruddin Ahmed for the job. Fakhruddin took office on 11 January 2007 and made it clear on his first day that he intended not only to arrange a free and fair election but also to clean up corruption. While Khaleda and Hasina criticised Fakruddin and claimed that it was not his job to clean up corruption, Yunus expressed his satisfaction. In an interview with the AFP news agency, Yunus remarked &quot;There is no ideology here.&quot; Hasina had a harsh reaction to Yunus&#x27;s comments, calling him a &quot;usurer who has not only failed to eradicate poverty but has also nurtured poverty.&quot; This was Hasina&#x27;s first public statement against Yunus. Later Yunus announced the name of this prospective political party, &quot;Nagorik Shakti&quot; (Citizens&#x27; Power), saying he had a mission to enter the political arena in his nation in hope of changing its identity from &quot;bottomless basket&quot; to &quot;rising tiger&quot;. However, on 3 May, Yunus published a third open letter and put his political ambitions to rest.

===Proceedings===

The Bangladesh government launched the first trial against Yunus in December 2010, alleging that in 1996 he had transferred approximately $100 million to a sister company of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations and he was found innocent by the Norwegian government.

Yunus became subject to legal proceedings over three criminal cases. A criminal defamation case was filed against Yunus for criticising politicians in 2007. A food inspector filed another case against Yunus, alleging that yogurt manufactured by Grameen-Danone was adulterated. The final blow came on 3 March 2011. Bangladesh Bank informed Grameen in a letter that Yunus had been removed from Grameen, citing old age. Backed by nine boards of directors, 22 thousand employees, and 8.3 million Grameen borrowers, Yunus defied the government order, returned to Grameen&#x27;s headquarters in Dhaka, and lodged an appeal at Dhaka High Court against the decision. However, Justice Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Justice Gobinda Chandra Tagore delivered the verdict against Yunus, claiming that Yunus&#x27;s posting as the MD of Grameen since 1999 was illegal as he had reached the age of 60 by then. Backed by international leaders (e.g., Hillary and Bill Clinton), national leaders (e.g., Sir Fazle Hasan Abed) and 8.3 million Grameen borrowers, Yunus filed an appeal in Bangladesh Supreme Court against the High Court&#x27;s verdict. The full bench of the Appellate Division headed by Chief Justice ABM Khairul Haque heard the appeal on 15 March 2011 and upheld Yunus&#x27;s removal by the government.

===From 2012===
On 2 August 2012, Sheikh Hasina approved a draft of &quot;Grameen Bank Ordinance 2012&quot; to increase government control over the bank. That power resided with the bank&#x27;s directors—nine poor women who were elected by 8.3 million Grameen borrowers. Hasina also ordered a fresh investigation into Yunus&#x27;s activities and financial transactions in his later years as managing director of Grameen, but people saw the move as an attempt to destroy his image. The prime minister also alleged that Yunus had received his earnings without the necessary permission from the government, including his Nobel Peace Prize earnings and book royalties.

On 4 October 2013, Bangladesh&#x27;s cabinet approved the draft of a new law that would give the country&#x27;s central bank greater control over Grameen Bank, raising the stakes in the long-running dispute. The Grameen Bank Act 2013 was approved at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and was passed by parliament on 7 November 2013. It replaced the Grameen Bank Ordinance, the law that underpinned the creation of Grameen Bank as a specialised microcredit institution in 1983. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in August 2013:

Since then, the government has started an investigation into the bank and is now planning to take over Grameen—a majority of whose shares are owned by its borrowers—and break it up into 19 regional lenders.

==Personal life==

Yunus belongs to a Muslim family. In 1967, while Yunus attended Vanderbilt University, he met Vera Forostenko, a student of Russian literature at Vanderbilt University and daughter of Russian immigrants to Trenton, New Jersey, United States. They were married in 1970. Yunus&#x27;s marriage with Vera ended within months of the birth of their baby girl, Monica Yunus, in 1979 in Chittagong, as Vera returned to New Jersey claiming that Bangladesh was not a good place to raise a baby. Monica Yunus became an operatic soprano based in New York City. Yunus later married Afrozi Yunus, who was then a researcher in physics at Manchester University. She was later appointed as a professor of physics at Jahangirnagar University. Their daughter Deena Afroz Yunus was born in 1986.

Yunus&#x27;s brother Muhammad Ibrahim is a former professor of physics at the University of Dhaka and the founder of The Center for Mass Education in Science (CMES), which brings science education to adolescent girls in villages. His other brother Muhammad Jahangir (d. 2019) was a television presenter and a social activist in Bangladesh.

==Yunus Centre==

The Yunus Centre, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is a think tank focused on social business, poverty alleviation, and sustainability. Founded in 2008 and chaired by Dr Yunus, it promotes his philosophy of social business and serves as a resource center for related initiatives. The centre&#x27;s activities include poverty eradication campaigns, research and publications, support for social business start-ups, organizing the Global Social Business Summit, and developing academic programs on social business with international universities.

==Awards and recognitions==
Yunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Grameen Bank, for their efforts to create economic and social development:


Yunus was the first Bangladeshi to ever get a Nobel Prize. He established Grameen Bank in 1983, which plays a significant role in poverty alleviation in various countries of the world including Bangladesh. In 2006, he and the Grameen Bank he founded jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize. After receiving the news of the important award, Yunus announced that he would use part of his share of the $1.4 million (equivalent to $ million in ) award money to create a company to make low-cost, high-nutrition food for the poor; while the rest would go towards establishing the Yunus Science and Technology University in his home district as well as setting up an eye hospital for the poor in Bangladesh.

Former U.S. president Bill Clinton was a vocal advocate for the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Yunus. He expressed this in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as well as in his autobiography &quot;My Life.&quot; In a speech given at University of California, Berkeley in 2002, President Clinton described Yunus as &quot;a man who long ago should have won the Nobel Prize [in Economics and] I&#x27;ll keep saying that until they finally give it to him.&quot; Conversely, &quot;The Economist&quot; stated explicitly that while Yunus was doing excellent work to fight poverty, it was not appropriate to award him the Peace Prize, stating: &quot;... the Nobel committee could have made a braver, more difficult, choice by declaring that there would be no recipient at all.&quot;
He is one of only seven persons to have won the Nobel Peace Prize, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal. Other notable awards include the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1984, the World Food Prize, the International Simon Bolivar Prize (1996), the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord and the Sydney Peace Prize in 1998, and the Seoul Peace Prize in 2006. Additionally, Yunus has been awarded 50 honorary doctorate degrees from universities across 20 countries, and 113 international awards from 26 countries including state honours from 10 countries. Bangladesh government brought out a commemorative stamp to honour his Nobel Award.

Yunus was named by &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; in March 2012 as one of 12 greatest entrepreneurs of the current era. In its citation, Fortune Magazine said &quot;Yunus&#x27; idea inspired countless numbers of young people to devote themselves to social causes all over the world.&quot;

In January 2008, Houston, Texas declared 14 January as &quot;Muhammad Yunus Day&quot;.

Yunus was named among the most desired thinkers the world should listen to by the FP 100 (world&#x27;s most influential elite) in the December 2009 issue of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine.

In 2010, the British magazine &quot;New Statesman&quot; listed Yunus at 40th in the list of &quot;The World&#x27;s 50 Most Influential Figures 2010&quot;.

Yunus received 50 honorary doctorate degrees from universities from Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Peru, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the UK, and the US. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon invited Yunus to serve as an MDG Advocate. Yunus sits on the Board of United Nations Foundation, Schwab Foundation, Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, Grameen Credit Agricole Microcredit Foundation. He has been a member of Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, ever since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace.

Yunus has become a well-known international figure. He has delivered numerous lectures around the world, and has appeared on popular television shows, including &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 2006, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in 2008, &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; in 2009 and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 2010. On Google+, Yunus was one of the most followed people worldwide, with over two million followers until Google closed its operations in 2019.

He has played a key advisory role in the Paris 2024 Olympics, promoting social business principles and encouraging sustainable, socially responsible projects. His influence led to initiatives like prioritizing social businesses in public tenders and integrating social housing into the athletes&#x27; village redevelopment.

<text>Marie Callender&#x27;s is an American restaurant chain. Its headquarters are in the Marie Callender&#x27;s Corporate Support Center in Mission Viejo, Orange County, California. As of April 2024, the company operates 24 locations in California, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah.

==History==
===First foundation===
In the 1930s, Marie Callender and her husband Cal Warren Callender began selling pies in the city of Long Beach and in Orange County. In 1948, they sold their family car and used the money to set up a wholesale bakery with their son Don. The first official location was opened in 1964.

Eventually, Don opened a retail outlet in Orange, California, naming it after his mother, gradually adding other food. Within five years the chain was expanded to 12 more locations and opened its first locations outside of California (Las Vegas and Houston) in 1969. It grew into 84 locations by the end of the 1970s. However, the Houston location closed down in 1981. In 1996, the company announced that they planned to open three new restaurants in the Houston area once again. At the end, all three remaining locations in Houston closed down in 2001 due to restaurants being unprofitable.

===Late 20th century sales===
In 1986, the restaurant chain was sold to Ramada Inn, then in 1990, to Wilshire Restaurant Group, Inc. Marie Callender pie shops, Inc. was purchased from Saunders Karp &amp; Megrue (SKM) in 1999 by an affiliate of Castle Harlan, a New York-based private equity firm.

The company owned the East Side Mario&#x27;s restaurant chain from 1997 (when it bought the chain from PepsiCo) to 2000.

===Perkins &amp; Marie Callender&#x27;s Inc===
In 2006, Castle Harlan merged Marie Callender&#x27;s with another of its interests, Perkins Restaurant &amp; Bakery. The combined chain, known as Perkins &amp; Marie Callender&#x27;s Inc. (PMCI), was headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.

The business flourished until Don Callender died on January 7, 2009, due to complications resulting from head trauma sustained during a fall at home.

On June 13, 2011, a total of 58 units were closed, including 31 Marie Callender&#x27;s and 27 Perkins&#x27; due to bankruptcy restructuring (Chapter 11). During bankruptcy, PMCI sold the Marie Callender&#x27;s brand to ConAgra for US$57.5 million. Later that year, PMCI exited bankruptcy under the control of Wayzata Investment Partners.

===Marie Callender&#x27;s Inc.===
On August 5, 2019, 29 stores were closed and the holding company for Perkins and Marie Callender&#x27;s filed for bankruptcy. The chains were later split apart, with Perkins being bought by Huddle House, while Marie Callender&#x27;s was sold to Elite Restaurant Group, which formed a new company known as Marie Callender&#x27;s Inc. to operate the chain, for US$1.75 million.

==Business==
===Restaurants===
In later years, a typical restaurant would have a fully stocked bar, or saloon, serving alcoholic beverages. This is in contrast to family restaurants like Denny&#x27;s or Village Inn, which generally do not serve alcoholic beverages. A salad bar is also a staple.

The type of cuisine served is mainly American, although many of the dishes are slanted towards styles of preparation that resemble Italian, Mexican, French, Cajun, or Chinese. Soups and sandwiches are available as meals or &quot;à la carte&quot;. Pies are signature items on the dessert menu: there are over 30 varieties available.

The interiors of the chain&#x27;s earlier restaurants are decorated with antiques circa 1900, providing a theme that is reminiscent of Victorian England as well as early United States. Later restaurants reflect more modern tastes, with a clean interior and photos of food.

===Frozen foods===
For years the chain has licensed its name for shelf-stable and frozen entrees and sides. Various product licenses were included in a sale to ConAgra Foods in 1994 for $140 million. The name &quot;Marie Callender&#x27;s&quot; was retained for the food line following the division&#x27;s sale. In 2010, its cheesy chicken &amp; rice meal was pulled due to a salmonella outbreak.

==Don Callender==

Donald W. Callender (September 27, 1927 – January 7, 2009) was an American restaurateur and co-founder of the Marie Callender&#x27;s chain of restaurants, which originated in Southern California. He was also the creator of Babe&#x27;s Slim Pign&#x27;s in Redlands, CA, P.H. Woods in Moreno Valley, CA, Top-Gun Restaurant Grill, and Babe&#x27;s Bar-B-Que &amp; Brewery in Rancho Mirage, CA.

Callender is credited as being among the first restaurateurs to offer franchise operations, with the first Marie Callender&#x27;s franchisee opening in Orange in 1964.

===Biography===
In the 1930s, Marie Callender (1907–1995), her husband Cal Warren Callender (1907–1984), and their only child, Don lived in a trailer park in Huntington Beach. Marie baked and sold pies to augment the family&#x27;s income, with Don delivering her pies to customers on his bicycle. A 1945 graduate of Long Beach Poly High School, he joined the Merchant Marine for a brief tour at the end of World War II and then returned home to southern California. 

Callender died at age 81 in 2009 at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, due to complications resulting from head trauma sustained during a fall at his home over a year earlier.

===Retail endeavors===
By 1948, twenty-one year old Don was working to expand the business by selling pies to restaurants in Long Beach and Orange County. In 1951, he purchased a home on Gondar Ave. in the Plaza area of Long Beach, where the Callender family did their baking before shifting the expanding operation to a Quonset hut on Anaheim St. in Long Beach. Eventually, Don ventured into the retail realm, opening his first outlet in Orange (at 574 N. Tustin St.) and naming it after his mother, Marie. With continued experimentation, he gradually expanded his inventory and added other menu items which would later become Marie Callender fare.

===Company sale and other businesses===
By the time Callender sold the company in 1986 to Ramada for a reported $80 million, the chain had grown to 120 locations nationwide. Following the sale, Don remained in the restaurant industry, planning to start a second 21,000 square foot (1950 square meter) Babe&#x27;s in Indio, California. Unfortunately, health issues forced Callender out of the project before seeing the project come to full fruition. The building was subsequently leased to Kaiser Restaurant Group, a local restaurant management consortium. Jackelope Ranch, also in Indio, opened the day after Don passed, as a Southwestern-themed barbecue.

<text>The Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), founded in 1959, is an international organization for higher education situated 40km north of Bangkok, Thailand. It specializes in engineering, advanced technologies, sustainable development, and management and planning. It aims to promote technological change and sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region, through higher education, research, and outreach.

==History==
Founded in 1959 as SEATO Graduate School of Engineering, it receives funding from organizations and governments around the world.

In 1967, The Constituent Assembly of Thailand approved legislation for the Charter of the newly named Asian Institute of Technology in October. The Asian Institute of Technology Enabling Act was published in the Royal Thai Government Gazette in November the same year. AIT became independent of SEATO as an institution of higher learning empowered to grant degrees.

On 21 October 2011, AIT&#x27;s campus was inundated by two-meter-high floodwaters. Since then, it has resumed operations.

AIT celebrated its 60th anniversary on 23–25 October 2019. Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the first royal alumna, presided over the celebrations on 24 October 2019.

In November 2019, AIT inaugurated the Belt &amp; Road Research Centre.

==Governance==
AIT has been governed by a board of governors since its beginning. Traditionally a high-ranking Thai citizen has been the chairman of its board of trustees. At present the chairman of the AIT Board of Trustees is Anat Arbhabirama.

Ambassadors of 14 countries – Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam – are members of the AIT Board of Trustees. The ambassador of Japan and the ambassador to the delegation of the European Union to Thailand have observer status on the AIT Board.

==Location==
AIT operates as a self-contained international community at its campus in Pathumthani Province, some north of Bangkok, Thailand. Besides laboratories and academic buildings, the main campus includes housing, sports, and medical facilities, a conference center, and a library with over 230,000 volumes and 830 print and online periodicals.

AIT was hosted by the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, before it moved to its present campus in November 1973. Currently, it is located in the Rangsit area next to Thammasat University (Rangsit Campus), about 65 kilometers from the Suvarnabhumi Airport.

AIT has a remote campus called AIT Center in Vietnam. It was established in 1993 under the memorandum of understanding between the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training and the AIT. At that time AITCV was the first international institution in Vietnam and the first AIT campus outside Thailand.

==Student body==
AIT&#x27;s student body comes from more than 50 countries, with Thailand contributing to about one-third. It has always been international, with international donors offering scholarships to AIT students for capacity building.

== Transition to intergovernmental organization status==

===Approval of new charter===
In August 2010, a new &quot;Charter of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)&quot; was adopted and signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand. Signatories to the new charter included Seychelles, Cambodia, Japan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Sweden, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, Philippines, India, and UNIFEM. The new charter came into force on 30 January 2012 as Sweden, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal deposited their instruments of ratification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand.

===Difficulties and return to old charter===
In 2012, Thailand declined to ratify the new charter, with the effect that the operations of AIT under the new intergovernmental charter resulted in the issuance of potentially invalid degrees. In December 2012, AIT opted to return to its previous national charter and ceased operating as an intergovernmental university. The degrees issued by AIT under the new charter were reissued under the old charter to avoid the risk of being unrecognized under Thai law. However, it seems that the &quot;Charter of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)&quot; remains legally in force without Thailand&#x27;s participation and is in dormant status.

===Listed among International Organizations by Thai Government===
AIT is listed among international organizations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Royal Thai Government.

==Host to international organizations==
The campus of Asian Institute of Technology is host to several international and non-governmental organizations including the Regional Resource Center in Asia and the Pacific (UNEP RRC.AP) (www.rrcap.unep.org), and the Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia (RIMES) (www.rimes.int).

It also hosts the global secretariat of the International Partnership for Expanding Waste Management Services of Local Authorities (IPLA), while the regional secretariat is hosted by UN HABITAT. Four UN agencies, three international donors and five national governments are part of IPLA.

AIT has collaborated with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to create a Yunus Center at AIT with an objective &quot;to contribute to poverty alleviation by enabling rural people to handle and be in control of improving their own livelihoods&quot;. The Yunus Center at AIT was launched on 8 September 2009. Likewise, AIT hosts Ostrom Center for Advanced Studies on Natural Resource Governance (OCeAN).

==Academic programs==
Asian Institute of Technology offers Master&#x27;s, Doctoral, and Certificate courses. Among the programs offered include regular Master&#x27;s and Doctoral programs, Flexible Degree options, One-Year Master&#x27;s programs, Professional Master&#x27;s programs, Unified International Bachelor-Master programs, Capacity-Building PhD Partnership programs, Erasmus Programs, Exchange Programs, Joint Degree Programs and Dual Degree programs.

==School of Engineering and Technology (SET)==
School of Engineering and Technology (SET) is the combinationof the two former Schools, namely, the School of Civil Engineering (SCE) and the School of Advanced Technologies (SAT), which merged in November 2005. Historically, the two schools came into existence only in January 1993 when the Institute reorganized the need to reform its academic structure from smaller-sized units called “Divisions” to larger bodies named “Schools”.

Since its inception, SET&#x27;s mission has been to develop highly qualified engineers and technologists who play leading roles in promoting the region&#x27;s industrial competitiveness in its integration into the global economy.
==School of Environment, Resources, and Development (SERD)==
The School of Environment, Resources and Development (SERD) was established by amalgamating the four Divisions, namely: (1) Environmental Engineering Division (2) Human Settlements Development Division (3) Agriculture and Food Engineering Division and (4) Energy Division, in 1993. The name SERD was adopted after the EARTH Summit in Rio in 1992, emphasizing the important co-existence of environment and development.

SERD responds to regional needs by mobilizing and enhancing capacities for socially, economically, and environmentally sound development in partnership with public and private sectors. The School&#x27;s interdisciplinary approach integrates technological, natural, and social sciences.
==School of Management (SOM)==
The School of Management was established in 1987 to meet the growing needs in Asia for graduate management education. Its goals are to impact the quality of management education and practices in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world, and to promote sustainable development, technological leadership, entrepreneurial spirit, wealth creation, and pride. 

Students of SOM have the options of either studying at its campus located in Bangkok or on its self-contained international main campus located 40 km (25 miles) north of the city.

<text>The Macintosh, later rebranded as the Macintosh 128K, is the original Macintosh personal computer from Apple. It is the first successful mass-market all-in-one desktop personal computer with a graphical user interface, built-in screen and mouse. It was pivotal in establishing desktop publishing as a general office function. The motherboard, a CRT monochrome monitor, and a floppy drive are in a beige case with integrated carrying handle; it has a keyboard and single-button mouse.

The Macintosh was introduced by a television commercial titled &quot;1984&quot; during Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, directed by Ridley Scott. Sales were strong at its initial release on January 24, 1984, at , and reached 70,000 units on May 3, 1984. Upon the release of its successor, the Macintosh 512K, it was rebranded as the Macintosh 128K. The computer&#x27;s model number is M0001.

==Development==
===1978–1984: Development===

In 1978, Apple began to organize the Lisa project, to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced Apple II or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in action. The Lisa was immediately redirected to use a GUI, which at that time was well beyond the state of the art for microprocessor abilities; the Xerox Alto has a custom processor spanning several circuit boards in a case the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 16/32-bit Motorola 68k in 1979, with at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs&#x27;s continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.

At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979, Jef Raskin began the Macintosh project. The design at that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a text-based user interface that allowed multitasking, and special command keys on the keyboard that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Bud Tribble, a member of the Macintosh team, asked Burrell Smith to integrate the Apple Lisa&#x27;s 68k microprocessor into the Macintosh so that it could run graphical programs. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that integrated an 8 MHz Motorola 68k. Smith&#x27;s design used less RAM than the Lisa, which made producing the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 KB of ROM – far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8 KB of ROM; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit (kb) RAM soldered to the logicboard. The final product&#x27;s screen was a , 512x342 pixel monochrome display.

Smith&#x27;s innovative design, combining the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa&#x27;s Motorola 68k CPU, began to receive Jobs&#x27;s attentions. Jobs took over the Macintosh project after deciding that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, which led former project leader Raskin to leave the team in 1981. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who had been leading the project with Raskin, was on temporary leave from the company at this time due to an airplane crash he had experienced earlier that year, making it easier for Jobs to take over the program. After development had completed, team member and engineer Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs&#x27;s ideas than Raskin&#x27;s. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in September 1981 reported on the existence of the secret Lisa and &quot;McIntosh&quot; projects at Apple.

=== 1984: Debut ===
In 1982, Regis McKenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the Macintosh. Later the Regis McKenna team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham, who eventually led the Apple account for the agency. Cunningham and Anderson were the primary authors of the Macintosh launch plan. The launch of the Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the &quot;multiple exclusive,&quot; event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique about a product and giving an inside look into a product&#x27;s creation.

After the Lisa&#x27;s announcement, John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious &quot;MacIntosh&quot; project at Apple in February 1983. The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont, California—in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, &quot;1984&quot;. It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a &quot;watershed event&quot; and a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. McKenna called the ad &quot;more successful than the Mac itself.&quot; &quot;1984&quot; used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the &quot;conformity&quot; of IBM&#x27;s attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised &quot;Big Brother.&quot;

Two days after &quot;1984&quot; aired, the Macintosh went on sale, and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. The Macintosh was the first successful mass-market all-in-one desktop personal computer with a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse. It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labelled it a mere &quot;toy&quot;. Apple sold it alongside its popular Apple II line until the others were discontinued in the 1990s. Because the operating system was designed largely for the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, Microsoft&#x27;s Multiplan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985. Apple introduced the Macintosh Office suite the same year with the &quot;Lemmings&quot; ad; infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.

Apple spent $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and ran a &quot;Test Drive a Macintosh&quot; promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year; one dealer reported a backlog of more than 600 orders. By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.

== Processor and memory ==
The heart of the computer is a Motorola 68000 microprocessor running at , connected to 128 KB RAM shared by the processor and the display controller. The boot procedure and some operating system routines are contained in a 64 KB ROM chip. Apple did not offer RAM upgrades. Unlike the Apple II, no source code listings of the Macintosh system ROMs were offered.

The RAM in the Macintosh consists of sixteen 64k×1 DRAMs. The 68000 and video controller take turns accessing DRAM every four CPU cycles during display of the frame buffer, while the 68000 has unrestricted access to DRAM during vertical and horizontal blanking intervals. Such an arrangement reduces the overall CPU performance as much as 35% for most code as the display logic often blocks the CPU&#x27;s access to RAM. Despite the nominally high clock rate, this causes the computer to run slower than several of its competitors and results in an effective clock rate of 6 MHz.

== Peripherals ==
The built-in display is a one-bit per pixel, black-and-white, 9 in/23 cm CRT with a fixed resolution of 512 × 342 pixels, using the Apple standard of 72 ppi (pixels per inch), a standard that was quickly abandoned once higher resolution screens became available. Expansion and networking are achieved using two non-standard DE-9 serial ports named &quot;Printer&quot; and &quot;Modem&quot; that support the RS-422 standard, but do not support hardware handshaking. An external floppy disk drive can be added using a proprietary connector (19-pin D-sub).

The keyboard used a simple proprietary protocol, allowing some third-party upgrades. The mouse used standard quadrature signals for X and Y, and the single mouse button used a single wire (all signals were compatible with TTL and referenced to ground). The original keyboard had no arrow keys, numeric keypad or function keys. This was an intentional decision by Apple, as these keys were common on older platforms and it was thought that the addition of these keys would encourage software developers to simply port their existing applications to the Mac, rather than design new ones around the GUI paradigm. Later, Apple made a numeric keypad available for the Macintosh 128K. The keyboard sold with the newer Macintosh Plus model included the numeric keypad and arrow keys, but still no function keys. Function keys eventually appeared in 1987 with the Extended Keyboard available for the Macintosh II and Macintosh SE. As with the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse has a single button.

Standard headphones can be connected to a monaural jack on the back of the computer. Apple also offered their 300 and 1200 baud modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially, the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter, a dot matrix printer which was designed to produce 144 dpi WYSIWYG output from the Mac&#x27;s 72 dpi screen. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple&#x27;s built-in networking system.

== Storage ==

The Macintosh contained a single 400 KB, single-sided -inch floppy disk drive, with no option to add any further internal storage, like a hard drive or additional floppy disk drive. The system software (Mac OS) was disk-based from the beginning, as RAM had to be conserved, but this &quot;Startup Disk&quot; could still be temporarily ejected. (Ejecting the root filesystem remained an unusual feature of the classic Mac OS until System 7.) One floppy disk was sufficient to store the System Software, an application and the data files created with the application.

The 400 KB drive capacity was larger than the PC XT&#x27;s 360 KB 5.25-inch drive. However, more sophisticated work environments of the time required separate disks for documents and the system installation. Due to the memory constraints (128 KB) of the original Macintosh, and the fact that the floppies could hold only 400 KB, users had to frequently swap disks in and out of the floppy drive, which caused external floppy drives to be utilized more frequently. The Macintosh External Disk Drive (mechanically identical to the internal one, piggybacking on the same controller) was a popular add-on that cost .

Third-party hard drives were considerably more expensive and usually connected to the slower serial port (as specified by Apple), although a few manufacturers chose to utilize the faster non-standard floppy port. The 128K can only use the original Macintosh File System released in 1984 for storage.
== Cooling ==

The unit did not include a fan, relying instead on convective heat transfer, which made it quiet while in operation. Steve Jobs insisted that the Macintosh ship without a fan, which persisted until the introduction of the Macintosh SE in 1987. Jobs believed that computers equipped with fans tend to distract the user from completing work. Unfortunately, this was allegedly a source of many common, costly component failures in the first four Macintosh models. This was enough of a problem to prompt the introduction of several third-party, external cooling fan solutions such as the MacFan, the Mac N Frost, the Fanny Mac and the Kensington System Saver. These units fit inside the Macintosh&#x27;s carrying-handle slot and produced a forced draft through the computer&#x27;s existing ventilation holes.

== Software ==

The Macintosh shipped with the very first System and Finder application, known to the public as &quot;System 1.0&quot; (formally known as System 0.97 and Finder 1.0). The original Macintosh saw three upgrades to both before it was discontinued. Apple recommends System 2.0 and Finder 4.2, with System 3.2 and Finder 5.3 as the maximum. System 4.0 officially dropped support for the Macintosh 128K because it was distributed on 800 KB floppy disks, which could not be used by the 128K.

The applications MacPaint and MacWrite were bundled with the Mac. Other programs available included MacProject, MacTerminal and Microsoft Word. Programming languages available at the time included MacBASIC, MacPascal and the Macintosh 68000 Development System. The Macintosh also came with a manual and a unique guided tour cassette tape which worked together with the guided tour diskette as a tutorial for both the Macintosh itself and the bundled applications, since most new Macintosh users had never used a mouse before, much less manipulated a graphical user interface.
== Models ==

The computer was released in January 1984 as simply the Apple Macintosh. Following the release of the Macintosh 512K in September, which expanded the memory from 128 KB to 512 KB, the original Macintosh was re-branded Macintosh 128K and nicknamed the &quot;thin Mac&quot;. The new 512K model was nicknamed the &quot;fat Mac&quot;. While functionally the same, as closed systems, the &quot;Macintosh&quot; and &quot;Macintosh 128K&quot; were technically two different computers, with the rebadged &quot;128K&quot; containing a completely redesigned logic board to easily accommodate both 128 KB and 512 KB RAM configurations during manufacturing. Though the RAM was still permanently soldered to the logic board, the new design allowed for easier (though unsanctioned) third-party upgrades to 512 KB. In addition, most of the newer models contained the 1984 revision B of the ROM to accommodate changes in the 400 KB floppy disk drive. System software contains support for an unreleased Macintosh 256K.

The increased RAM of the 512K was vitally important for the Macintosh as it finally allowed for more powerful software applications, such as the then-popular Microsoft Multiplan. However, Apple continued to market the Macintosh 128K for over a year as an entry-level computer, the mid-level Macintosh 512K and high-end Lisa (and claiming that it could be easily expanded should the user ever need more RAM).

The difficulty of fitting software into the Macintosh 128K&#x27;s limited free memory, coupled with the new user interface and event-driven programming model, discouraged software vendors from supporting it. The Macintosh 128K was left with a relatively small software library, limited to a set of early and specially crafted programs. The later Macintosh 512K and Macintosh Plus are compatible with a wider range of software, with the Macintosh Plus maintaining compatibility with much later programs.

== Expansion ==
Jobs stated that because &quot;customization really is mostly software now ... most of the options in other computers are in Mac&quot;, unlike the Apple II the Macintosh 128K did not need slots; he described expansion slots as costly and requiring larger size and more power. It was not officially upgradable by the user and only Apple service centers were permitted to open the case. There were third parties that did offer RAM upgrades and even memory and CPU upgrades, allowing the original 128 KB Macintosh to be expanded to a 4 MB 32-bit data path, 68020 CPU (16 MHz), 68881 FPU (16 MHz), 68851 MMU (16 MHz) with an external SCSI port (with a ribbon cable out the clock battery door, internal SCSI hard drive (20 MB Rodime) and a piezo-electric fan for cooling. This upgrade was featured on a &quot;Macworld&quot; magazine cover titled &quot;Faster than a Vax&quot; in August 1986.

All accessories were external, such as the MacCharlie that added IBM PC compatibility. There was no provision for adding internal storage, more RAM or any upgrade cards; however, some of the Macintosh engineers objected to Jobs&#x27;s ideas and secretly developed workarounds for them. As an example, the Macintosh was supposed to have only 17 address lines on the motherboard, enough to support 128 KB of system RAM, but the design team added two address lines without Jobs&#x27;s knowledge, making it possible to expand the computer to 512 KB, although the actual act of upgrading system RAM was difficult and required piggybacking additional RAM chips atop the onboard 4164 chips. 

In September 1984, after months of complaints over the Mac&#x27;s inadequate RAM, Apple released an official 512 KB machine (The Macintosh 512K). Although this had always been planned from the beginning, Steve Jobs maintained if the user desired more RAM than the Mac 128 provided, he should simply pay extra money for a Mac 512 rather than upgrade the computer himself. When the Mac 512 was released, Apple rebranded the original model as &quot;Macintosh 128k&quot; and modified the motherboard to allow easier RAM upgrades. Improving on the hard-wired RAM thus required a motherboard replacement (which was priced similarly to a new computer), or a third-party chip replacement upgrade, which was not only expensive but would void Apple&#x27;s warranty.

A stock Mac 128K with the original 64K ROM is incompatible with either Apple&#x27;s external 800 KB drive with the Hierarchical File System or Apple&#x27;s Hard Disk 20. A Mac 128K that has been upgraded with the newer 128 KB ROM (called a Macintosh 128Ke) can use internal and external 800 KB drives with HFS, as well as the HD20. Both can print on an AppleShare network, but neither can do file sharing because of their limited RAM.

== OEM upgrades ==
By early 1985, much Macintosh software required 512K of memory. Apple sold an official memory upgrade for the Macintosh 128K, which included a motherboard replacement effectively making it a Macintosh 512K, for the price of . Additionally, Apple offered an 800 KB floppy disk drive kit, including updated 128K ROMs. Finally, a Mac 128K could be upgraded to a Macintosh Plus by swapping the logic board as well as the case back (to accommodate the slightly different port configuration) and optionally adding the Macintosh Plus extended keyboard. Any of the kits could be purchased alone or together at any time, for a partial or full upgrade for the Macintosh 128K. All upgrades were required to be performed by professional Apple technicians, who reportedly refused to work on any Macintosh upgraded to 512K without Apple&#x27;s official upgrade, which at was much more expensive than about for third-party versions.

== Credits ==
The original Macintosh was exceptional in that it included the signatures of the Macintosh Division as of early 1982 molded on the inside of the case. The names are Peggy Alexio, Colette Askeland, Bill Atkinson, Steve Balog, Bob Belleville, Mike Boich, Bill Bull, Matt Carter, Berry Cash, Debi Coleman, George Crow, Donn Denman, Christopher Espinosa, Bill Fernandez, Martin Haeberli, Andy Hertzfeld, Joanna Hoffman, Rod Holt, Bruce Horn, Hap Horn, Brian Howard, Steve Jobs, Larry Kenyon, Patti King, Daniel Kottke, Angeline Lo, Ivan Mach, Jerrold Manock, Mary Ellen McCammon, Vicki Milledge, Mike Murray, Ron Nicholson Jr., Terry Oyama, Benjamin Pang, Jef Raskin, Ed Riddle, Brian Robertson, Dave Roots, Patricia Sharp, Burrell Smith, Bryan Stearns, Lynn Takahashi, Guy &quot;Bud&quot; Tribble, Randy Wigginton, Linda Wilkin, Steve Wozniak, Pamela Wyman and Laszlo Zidek.

The Macintosh 128/512K models also included Easter eggs in the OS ROM. If the user went to the system debugger and typed codice_1, a graphic would appear in the upper left corner of the screen with &quot;STOLEN FROM APPLE COMPUTER&quot; and a low-resolution facsimile of the Apple logo. This was designed to prevent unauthorized cloning of the Macintosh after numerous Apple II clones appeared, many of which simply stole Apple&#x27;s copyrighted system ROMs. Steve Jobs allegedly planned that if a Macintosh clone appeared on the market and a court case happened, he could access this Easter egg on the computer to prove that it was using pirated Macintosh ROMs. The Macintosh SE later augmented this Easter Egg with a slideshow of four photos of the Apple design team when codice_2 was entered.

== Reception ==
Erik Sandberg-Diment of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in January 1984 stated that Macintosh &quot;presages a revolution in personal computing&quot;. Although preferring larger screens and calling the lack of color a &quot;mistake&quot;, he praised the &quot;refreshingly crisp and clear&quot; display and lack of fan noise. While unsure whether it would become &quot;a second standard to Big Blue&quot;, Ronald Rosenberg of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote in February of &quot;a euphoria that Macintosh will change how America computes. Anyone that tries the pint-size machine gets hooked by its features&quot;. The computer was indeed so compelling to buyers that one dealer in March described it as &quot;the first $2,500 impulse item&quot;.

Gregg Williams of &quot;BYTE&quot; in February found the hardware and software design (which it predicted would be &quot;imitated but not copied&quot;) impressive, but criticized the lack of a standard second disk drive. He predicted that the computer would popularize the 3½ in floppy disk drive standard, that the Macintosh would improve Apple&#x27;s reputation, and that it &quot;will delay IBM&#x27;s domination of the personal computer market.&quot; Williams concluded that the Macintosh was &quot;the most important development in computers in the last five years. [It] brings us one step closer to the ideal of computer as appliance.&quot; In the May 1984 issue Williams added, &quot;Initial reaction to the Macintosh has been strongly, but not overpoweringly, favorable. A few traditional computer users see the mouse, the windows, and the desktop metaphor as silly, useless frills, and others are outraged at the lack of color graphics, but most users are impressed by the machine and its capabilities. Still, some people have expressed concern about the relatively small 128K-byte RAM size, the lack of any computer language sent as part of the basic unit, and the inconvenience of the single disk drive.&quot;

Jerry Pournelle, also of &quot;BYTE&quot;, added that &quot;The Macintosh is a bargain only if you can get it at the heavily discounted price offered to faculty and students of the favored 24 universities in the Macintosh consortium.&quot; He noted, however, that the Macintosh attracted people &quot;who previously hated computers... There is, apparently, something about mice and pull-down menus and icons that appeal to people previously intimidated by A&gt; and the like&quot;.

<text>Dogpile is a metasearch engine for information on the World Wide Web that fetches results from Google, Yahoo!, Yandex, Bing, and other popular search engines, including those from audio and video content providers such as Yahoo!.

== History ==
Dogpile began operation in November 1996. The site was created and developed by Aaron Flin, who was frustrated with the varying results of existing indexes and intending on making Dogpile query multiple indexes for the best search results. It originally provided web searches from Yahoo! (directory), Lycos (inc. A2Z directory), Excite (inc. Excite Guide directory), WebCrawler, Infoseek, AltaVista, HotBot, WhatUseek (directory), and World Wide Web Worm. It naturally drew comparisons with MetaCrawler, a multi-threaded search engine that had existed before, but Dogpile was more advanced, and it could also search Usenet (from sources including DejaNews) and FTP (via Filez and other indexes).

In August 1999, Dogpile was acquired by Go2net, who were already operating MetaCrawler. Go2net was then acquired by InfoSpace in July 2000 for $4 billion. Dogpile received a design facelift for the first time in December 2000.

The Dogpile search engine earned the J.D. Power and Associates award for best Residential Online Search Engine Service in both 2006 and 2007.

In August 2008, Dogpile and Petfinder agreed to a search partnership.

In November 2008, Dogpile launched its &quot;Search and Rescue&quot; program, which donates money to animal-related charities. The program also helps people find help for animals in need. By early-December 2008, people using the Dogpile search engine had raised $100,000 for Dogpile&#x27;s Search and Rescue program.

In July 2016, InfoSpace was sold by its parent company Blucora to OpenMail for $45 million in cash, putting Dogpile under the ownership of OpenMail. OpenMail was later renamed System1.

==Studies==

In April 2005, Dogpile collaborated with researchers from University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University to measure the overlap and ranking differences of leading Web search engines in order to gauge the benefits of using a metasearch engine to search the web. Results found that from 10,316 random user-defined queries from Google, Yahoo!, and Ask Jeeves only 3.2 percent of first page search results were the same across those search engines for a given query. Another study later that year using 12,570 random user-defined queries from Google, Yahoo!, MSN Search, and Ask Jeeves found that only 1.1 percent of first page search results were the same across those search engines for a given query.

These studies showed that each search engine provides vastly different results. While users of the search engine may not recognize a problem, it was shown that they use ~3 search engines per month. Dogpile realized that searchers are not necessarily finding the results they were looking for in one search engine and thus decided to redefine their existing metasearch engine to provide the best results.

== Features ==
As of 2013, Dogpile listed the following features in addition to its search function:
* Category Links: Links to help users focus their search on specific categories like News, Audio, etc.
* Yellow Pages: Allows users to do a search using the Yellow Pages for business, institutions and firms.
* White Pages: Allows users to do a search using the White Pages for private people. (No longer available as of February 23, 2017)
* Preferences: Links to a page where users can set a variety of customized search preferences.
* Spelling Correction: Offers suggested spellings for words that may be misspelled and automatically corrects commonly misspelled keywords.
* Search Filter: Blocks potentially explicit content for multimedia searches in Moderate setting and for all searches when in Heavy setting.
* Statistics Bar: Shows how many results were returned for the search term.
* About Results: Find out about Dogpile&#x27;s policies regarding sponsored and non-sponsored search results.
* IntelliFind: Recommends additional content based on the original search term.
* &quot;Are You Looking For?&quot;: Offers suggested spellings for words that may be misspelled and other search keywords that seem to be related to the original search term.
* Recent Searches: Keeps track of the 15 most recent searches. The list resets when the browser is closed.
* Favorite Fetches: Shows recent popular searches from other users.

A National Trust poll elected him one of Australia&#x27;s 100 national living treasures.

==Early years==

Phillip Andrew Hedley Adams was born in Maryborough, Victoria, the only child of an English-born Congregational Church minister, the Reverend Charles Adams. His childhood was anything but idyllic and his parents separated when he was young. Interviewed in 2006, Adams said that:
Of his education he has said: &quot;I was forced to leave school before completing my secondary education and the only job I could get was working in advertising.&quot;

Adams joined the Communist Party of Australia at age 16, while employed in advertising, but left at age 19. In a 2015 article for &quot;The Australian&quot;, Adams wrote that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) opened a file on him when he was 15 as a &quot;radicalised teenager... Having replaced scouting’s woggle and knots with Stalin’s hammer and sickle.&quot;

After his time in the communist movement, Adams joined the Australian Labor Party, parting only after what he described in 2010 as &quot;50 years of membership, through thick and thin&quot;.

== Career ==
Adams began his advertising career with Briggs &amp; James and, later, with Brian Monahan and Lyle Dayman, became a partner in the agency Monahan Dayman Adams. He developed successful campaigns such as &quot;Life. Be in it.&quot;, &quot;Slip, Slop, Slap&quot;, &quot;Break down the Barriers&quot; for the International Year of the Disabled Person and &quot;Care for Kids&quot; for the International Year of the Child, working with talent such as Fred Schepisi, Alex Stitt, Peter Best, Robyn Archer and Mimmo Cozzolino. Adams left the advertising industry in the 1980s. Monahan Dayman Adams purchased the successful Sydney agency MoJo in 1987 and carried on as MojoMDA.

He wrote regular columns for &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;The Australian&quot;, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The National Times&quot;, &quot;Nation Review&quot;, &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; (Adelaide), &quot;The Examiner&quot; (Tasmania), &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and was a contributor to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; of London. He currently writes a weekly column for &quot;The Australian&quot;.

===Film work===
Adams played a key role in the revival of the Australian film industry during the 1970s. He was the author of a 1969 report which led to legislation by prime minister John Gorton in 1970 for an Australian Film and Television Development Corporation (later the Australian Film Commission) and the Experimental Film Fund.

Together with Barry Jones, Adams was a motivating force behind the Australian Film Television and Radio School which was established under the Whitlam government. Adams played a key role in the development of the South Australian Film Corporation, which was created in 1972 and became a model for similar bodies in other Australian states; and in the establishment of the Australia Council and the Australian Film Development Corporation, later known as the Australian Film Commission, the Film Finance Corporation Australia, and Screen Australia. As head of delegation to the Cannes Film Festival, Adams signed Australia&#x27;s first co-production agreements with France and the UK. He was Chairman of the Australian Film Institute, the Film and Television Board of the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, and Film Australia.

In the 1960s Adams co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed (as well as serving as cinematographer for) his first feature film &quot;Jack and Jill: A Postscript&quot; (1969); the first feature to win the AFI Award, and the first Australian film to win the Grand Prix at an international festival.

Adams produced or co-produced other features including the critically panned but hugely popular film adaptation of Barry Humphries&#x27; &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot;, directed by Bruce Beresford, which became the most successful Australian film ever made up to that time. Other films include &quot;The Naked Bunyip&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot;, &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;, &quot;We of the Never Never&quot;, &quot;Grendel Grendel Grendel&quot;, &quot;Fighting Back&quot;, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; and &quot;Abra Cadabra&quot;.

===Broadcasting===
Adams initially presented a late-night program on Sydney commercial radio station 2UE during the late 1980s and early 1990s before succeeding Virginia Bell in 1991 as presenter of ABC Radio National&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Live&quot;, interviewing guests on a wide range of topics including politics, science, philosophy, history and culture. &quot;Late Night Live&quot; is broadcast across Australia on ABC Radio National, as well as on Radio Australia and the Internet. The program is broadcast live Monday to Thursday from 22:00 AEST/ADST and is repeated the following day at 15:00 AEST/ADST. A serious discussion of world issues, the program is tempered with Adams&#x27; gentle and ironic humour. Regular contributors include Bruce Shapiro and Beatrix Campbell. Phillip&#x27;s last episode was broadcast on 27 June 2024 and he will be replaced by David Marr.

At times, Adams refers tongue-in-cheek to his listeners as &quot;the listener&quot; or &quot;Gladys&quot;, as though he had only one listener; he also refers to listeners collectively as &quot;Gladdies&quot;. In more recent years, Adams has begun introducing the show saying &quot;Good evening Gladdies and Poddies&quot;, in reference to the show&#x27;s growing podcast listener base.

The current theme music is the first movement of Brescianello&#x27;s . Until March 2016 the theme was a short extract from the &quot;Eliza Aria&quot; from the &quot;Wild Swans Concert Suite&quot; by Elena Kats-Chernin, performed by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra with soprano Jane Sheldon, chosen in 2010. From 2007 to 2010, the theme music was Kats-Chernin&#x27;s &quot;Russian Rag&quot;, which Adams humorously refers to as &quot;The Waltz of the Wombat&quot;. The previous music was Bach&#x27;s Concerto for oboe, violin and orchestra in C minor, BWV 1060: III. &quot;Allegro&quot;.

===Other work===
Adams was the foundation chairman of the Commission for the Future, established by the Hawke government to build bridges between science and the community. He chaired the National Australia Day Council; whose principal task was to choose the Australian of the Year.

Adams was the inaugural chair for the Australian Centre for Social Innovation, established by the South Australian government, and chaired the advisory board for the Centre for the Mind at the University of Sydney and the Australian National University. He has been a board member of Greenpeace, CARE Australia, the National Museum of Australia, The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, the Adelaide Festival of Ideas and Brisbane&#x27;s Ideas Festival, and is an Ambassador of Bush Heritage Australia and the National Secular Lobby. He was co-founder of the Australian Skeptics.

Adams is the author or editor of more than 20 books, including &quot;The Unspeakable Adams&quot;, &quot;Adams Versus God&quot;, &quot;The Penguin Book of Australian Jokes&quot;, &quot;Retreat from Tolerance&quot;, &quot;Talkback and A Billion Voices&quot;, &quot;Adams Ark&quot;, and, with Lee Burton, &quot;Emperors of the Air&quot;.

===Political views and activities===
Adams is a humanist..

Robert Manne has described Adams as &quot;the emblematic figurehead of the pro-Labor left intelligentsia&quot;. After a youth in the Australian Communist movement, Adams was for many years a member of the Australian Labor Party, and had a close relationship with every Labor leader from Gough Whitlam to Kevin Rudd, advising on public relations, advertising and policy issues. In 2010, Adams resigned from the Labor Party after fifty years of membership, dissatisfied with the removal of Rudd by Julia Gillard in the 2010 Labor leadership spill. The Green Left Weekly described Adams in 2011 as &quot;unrepentantly left-wing, although, despite the tireless 71-year-old tearing up his ALP membership card (and voting Green) in 2010, he has not completely abandoned the dead carcass of the ALP that he had lugged around for decades.&quot;

In 1995 Adams argued against Section 18C of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot;, saying that a better response to expressions of racial hatred was &quot;public debate, not legal censure&quot;.

During the tenure of the Howard government, Adams described Liberal Prime Minister John Howard as &quot;far and away the worst prime minister in living memory&quot;. In 2022, Adams Tweeted that Australian cricketer Donald Bradman was a &quot;right wing nut job&quot; for being critical of socialism in a letter to Malcolm Fraser following the Dismissal of the Whitlam Labor government. His tweet on the subject was described as racist by one of its targets, Kamahl, and no evidence has been found to support Adams assertion about Nelson Mandela, the opposite seems to be the case.

===&quot;Honorary white&quot; tweet===
Adams was accused of using a racist and pejorative term in his response to Kamahl, a Malaysian-born Australian singer, whom Adams referred to on Twitter as an &quot;honorary white&quot;. After Kamahl had informed Adams that he had been welcomed at Bradman&#x27;s home from 1988 until his death in 2001, Adams responded: &quot;Clearly, Kamahl, he made you an Honorary White. Whereas one of the most towering political figures of the 20th century was deemed unworthy of Bradman’s approval.” Adams was referring to the unsubstantiated claims that Bradman had refused to meet Mandela due to political and racial differences, which was contrary to the well-documented respect Mandela had held for Bradman arising from Bradman&#x27;s staunch opposition to the apartheid regime.

Mandela had asked to meet Bradman during a visit to Sydney in 2000 but due to poor health Bradman was unable to leave Adelaide. However, Bradman did gift a framed photograph which was presented to Mandela by actor Jack Thompson. Bradman died less than six months later.

When ABC managing director David Anderson was asked about Adams&#x27; tweet by Senator Ross Cadell in an Australian Senate committees hearing, Anderson said it was his understanding that Adams had privately written to Kamahl to apologise. Kamahl denied this and wrote to Anderson to advise him that he had received no such correspondence from Adams. According to Kamahl, the only action Adams had taken was to block him on Twitter and to double down on his original comments, adding &quot;For the record Mr Anderson, I am not an honorary white man but a very proud black Australian man, deeply insulted by the treatment I have received from your employee and your organisation.&quot;

Anderson responded by asking Kamahl to accept his &quot;sincere apologies&quot; as he had been advised that an apology had been sent, but had now asked Adams to convey his apologies to him directly. Although Adams claimed that he had sent a handwritten note to Kamahl two weeks prior, he sent an email to Kamahl in which he wrote: “It pains me deeply that you believe I’ve been both unkind and cruel to you. This stems from a misunderstanding about ‘that tweet’ – intended as a rebuke to Bradman not to you. I regret that my words have been misunderstood and that they have caused you unhappiness&quot;. Kamahl rejected the apology, describing it as &quot;arrogant&quot;, and asked Adams to apologise publicly on &quot;Late Night Live&quot;.

==Personal life==

Adams is married to Patrice Newell. He has four daughters: three with his first wife, Rosemary Fawcett, and one with Newell. He lives on &quot;Elmswood&quot;, a large property near Gundy in the Hunter Valley in mid-northern New South Wales. He and his wife grow garlic and olives, and farm organically fed cattle. He previously had a home in Paddington, an inner suburb of Sydney. Prior to this, Adams lived for some time in Stoneleigh, a heritage-listed house in Darlinghurst. Adams collects antiquities from many &quot;dead civilisations&quot;, including sculptures and artifacts of Egyptian, Roman, Greek, Etruscan, South American and other indigenous cultures&#x27; origin.

He has written &quot;I&#x27;d been an atheist since I was five.&quot;

In 1979 a portrait of Adams by artist Wes Walters won the Archibald Prize.

<doc id="548127" wikidata="Q654114" url="?curid=548127" title="Macintosh 512K">
<text>The Macintosh 512K is a personal computer that was designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from September 1984 to April 1986. It is the first update to the original Macintosh 128K. It was virtually identical to the previous Macintosh, differing primarily in the amount of built-in random-access memory. The increased memory turned the Macintosh into a more business-capable computer and gained the ability to run more software. It is the earliest Macintosh model that can be used as an AppleShare server and, with a bridge Mac, communicate with modern devices.

The Mac 512K originally shipped with Macintosh System 1.1 but was able to run all versions of Mac OS up to System 4.1. It was replaced by the Macintosh 512Ke and the Macintosh Plus. All support for the Mac 512K was discontinued on September 1, 1998.

==Features==

===Processor and memory===
Like the Macintosh 128K before it, the 512K contained a Motorola 68000 connected to 512 KB of DRAM by a 16-bit data bus. Though the memory had been quadrupled, it could not be upgraded. The large increase earned it the nickname Fat Mac. A 64 KB ROM chip boosts the effective memory to 576 KB, but this is offset by the display&#x27;s 22 KB framebuffer, which is shared with the DMA video controller. This shared arrangement reduces CPU performance by up to 35%. It shared a revised logic board with the rebadged Macintosh 128K (previously just called the Macintosh), which streamlined manufacturing. The resolution of the display was the same at 512 × 342.

Apple sold a memory upgrade for the Macintosh 128K for $995 initially, and reduced the price when 256 Kb DRAM prices fell months later.

===Software===
The applications MacPaint and MacWrite were still bundled with the Mac. Soon after this model was released, several other applications became available, including MacDraw, MacProject, Macintosh Pascal and others. In particular, Microsoft Excel, which was written specifically for the Macintosh, required a minimum of 512 KB of RAM, but solidified the Macintosh as a serious business computer. Models with the &quot;enhanced&quot; ROM also supported Apple&#x27;s Switcher, allowing cooperative multitasking among (necessarily few) applications.

===New uses===
The LaserWriter printer became available shortly after the 512K&#x27;s introduction, as well as the number pad, mic, tablet, keyboard, mouse, basic mouse, and much more. It utilized Apple&#x27;s built-in networking scheme LocalTalk which allows sharing of devices among several users. The 512K was the oldest Macintosh capable of supporting Apple&#x27;s AppleShare built-in file sharing network, when introduced in 1987. The expanded memory in the 512K allowed it to better handle large word-processing documents and make better use of the graphical user interface and generally increased speed over the 128K model.

Color Systems Technology used an army of 512K units connected to a custom Intel 80186-based machine to colorize numerous black-and-white films in the mid-1980s.

===System software===
The original 512K could accept Macintosh system software up to version 4.1; System Software 5 was possible if used with the Hard Disk 20.

==Upgrades==

An updated version replaced the Macintosh 512K and debuted as the Macintosh 512K &quot;enhanced&quot; in April 1986. It differed from the original 512K in that it had an 800 KB floppy disk drive and the same improved ROM as the Macintosh Plus. With the exception of the new model number (M0001E), they were otherwise cosmetically identical. The stock 512K could also use an 800 KB floppy disk drive as well as the Hard Disk 20, the first hard disk manufactured by Apple exclusively for use with the 512K, but required a special system file (not required by the 512K&quot;e&quot;) that loaded the improved ROM code into RAM, thus reducing the RAM available for other uses. Apple offered an upgrade kit which replaced the floppy disk drive and ROMs, essentially turning it into a 512K&quot;e&quot;. One further OEM upgrade replaced the logic board and the rear case entirely with that of the Macintosh Plus.

As with the original Macintosh, the 512K was designed with no slots for upgrade boards and had no hard-disk controller, so the few internal upgrades that were available for the 512K, such as General Computer&#x27;s US$2,795 Hyperdrive hard drive, had to plug directly into the 68000 processor socket. Other such upgrades included &quot;snap-on&quot; SCSI cards and RAM upgrades of 2 MB or more.

He is best known for his contributions to &quot;The Railway Series&quot; of books featuring Thomas the Tank Engine, which was started by his father, Wilbert Awdry (1911–1997). He also produced children&#x27;s books based on a number of other railways, as well as non-fiction articles and books on heritage railways. He was born at Devizes, the family moving to Kings Norton, Birmingham, when he was aged five months. Awdry was educated at Worksop College, a public school in North Nottinghamshire.

==Christopher Awdry and &quot;The Railway Series&quot;==
Christopher Awdry is in a way responsible for the creation of Thomas and his railway, which started as a story told to him by his father during a bout of measles in 1942. When his father retired in 1972, he wrote several Thomas books himself. The series came to be called &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; after that.

In 2006, the current publishers, Egmont Books, decided to reprint the entire series in their original form; the 14 books by Christopher were re-released at the beginning of August 2007. His favourite character is Toby.

The new interest from the publishers has gone beyond merely re-releasing the existing books. Christopher Awdry has written a new book for the series, titled &quot;Thomas and Victoria&quot;, which focuses on stories relating to the railway preservation movement. This, the 41st book in the series, was released on 3 September 2007. In April 2010, Egmont Books confirmed that another Railway Series book, no 42 in the series, would be published in 2011. The publication date was later confirmed as 4 July 2011, and the illustrator as Clive Spong. It was published under the title &quot;Thomas and His Friends&quot;. This book would become the final book in the Railway Series to be published.

==Other works==
In 2001, Christopher Awdry wrote six stories featured in two books concerning railway safety, which were distributed to every primary school and library in the country (&quot;Bad Days for Thomas and His Friends / More Bad Days for Thomas and His Friends&quot;). The train operator Virgin Trains produced a colouring book for young passengers based on the stories.

A series of six books has been produced featuring locomotives from the Eastbourne Miniature Steam Railway, and illustrated by Marc Vyvyan-Jones.

<doc id="548130" wikidata="Q784858" url="?curid=548130" title="List of NHL records (team)">
<text>This is a list of team records recognized by the National Hockey League through the end of the 2023–24 NHL season.

== Season records ==

During the first eight years the NHL existed, teams played between 18 and 36 games in a season. Beginning in 1926, teams played 44–60 games. This ended in 1949 where teams now play 70 or more games. There have been four instances since then when teams have played fewer than 70 games in a season. Both the 1994–95 season and 2012–13 season were reduced to 48 games due to lockouts. The 2019–20 season and 2020–21 season were reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, check the History of the National Hockey League.

Notes:
Ties were only recorded until 2003–04. In 1983, the NHL added a five-minute overtime, and ties would only occur after 65 minutes. Starting with the 1999-2000 season, the NHL credited one point to the team that lost in overtime, leading to a system in which teams could potentially earn three points between them in a single game, rather than a fixed number of two previously. In 2005, the league eliminated ties meaning that any game which went to overtime would be a three-point game. Games that didn&#x27;t end in overtime would end in a shootout between the two teams. These changes in points awarded therefore make strict comparisons in wins, losses, and ties (after overtime, 1983–99, and in regulation, 1999–present) before and after these dates slightly problematic.

A losing streak includes losses in regulation (note from the implementation of overtime in 1983 until 1999, losses in overtime also counted, but abolished after overtime became reduced strength of four players each).

<text>In control theory and signal processing, a linear, time-invariant system is said to be minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable.

The most general causal LTI transfer function can be uniquely factored into a series of an all-pass and a minimum phase system. The system function is then the product of the two parts, and in the time domain the response of the system is the convolution of the two part responses. The difference between a minimum-phase and a general transfer function is that a minimum-phase system has all of the poles and zeros of its transfer function in the left half of the &quot;s&quot;-plane representation (in discrete time, respectively, inside the unit circle of the &quot;z&quot; plane). Since inverting a system function leads to poles turning to zeros and conversely, and poles on the right side (&quot;s&quot;-plane imaginary line) or outside (&quot;z&quot;-plane unit circle) of the complex plane lead to unstable systems, only the class of minimum-phase systems is closed under inversion. Intuitively, the minimum-phase part of a general causal system implements its amplitude response with minimal group delay, while its all-pass part corrects its phase response alone to correspond with the original system function.

The analysis in terms of poles and zeros is exact only in the case of transfer functions which can be expressed as ratios of polynomials. In the continuous-time case, such systems translate into networks of conventional, idealized LCR networks. In discrete time, they conveniently translate into approximations thereof, using addition, multiplication, and unit delay. It can be shown that in both cases, system functions of rational form with increasing order can be used to efficiently approximate any other system function; thus even system functions lacking a rational form, and so possessing an infinitude of poles and/or zeros, can in practice be implemented as efficiently as any other.

In the context of causal, stable systems, we would in theory be free to choose whether the zeros of the system function are outside of the stable range (to the right or outside) if the closure condition wasn&#x27;t an issue. However, inversion is of great practical importance, just as theoretically perfect factorizations are in their own right. (Cf. the spectral symmetric/antisymmetric decomposition as another important example, leading e.g. to Hilbert transform techniques.) Many physical systems also naturally tend towards minimum-phase response, and sometimes have to be inverted using other physical systems obeying the same constraint.

Insight is given below as to why this system is called minimum-phase, and why the basic idea applies even when the system function cannot be cast into a rational form that could be implemented.

== Inverse system ==

A system formula_1 is invertible if we can uniquely determine its input from its output. I.e., we can find a system formula_2 such that if we apply formula_1 followed by formula_2, we obtain the identity system formula_5. (See Inverse matrix for a finite-dimensional analog). That is,
formula_6

Suppose that formula_7 is input to system formula_1 and gives output formula_9:
formula_10

Applying the inverse system formula_2 to formula_9 gives
formula_13

So we see that the inverse system formula_14 allows us to determine uniquely the input formula_7 from the output formula_9.

=== Discrete-time example ===

Suppose that the system formula_1 is a discrete-time, linear, time-invariant (LTI) system described by the impulse response formula_18 for in . Additionally, suppose formula_2 has impulse response formula_20. The cascade of two LTI systems is a convolution. In this case, the above relation is the following:
formula_21
where formula_22 is the Kronecker delta, or the identity system in the discrete-time case. (Changing the order of formula_23 and formula_24 is allowed because of commutativity of the convolution operation.) Note that this inverse system formula_2 need not be unique.

== Minimum-phase system ==
When we impose the constraints of causality and stability, the inverse system is unique; and the system formula_1 and its inverse formula_2 are called minimum-phase. The causality and stability constraints in the discrete-time case are the following (for time-invariant systems where is the system&#x27;s impulse response, and formula_28 is the &quot;ℓ&quot;1 norm):

=== Causality ===

formula_29
and
formula_30

=== Stability ===

formula_31
and
formula_32

See the article on stability for the analogous conditions for the continuous-time case.

== Frequency analysis ==
=== Discrete-time frequency analysis ===

Performing frequency analysis for the discrete-time case will provide some insight. The time-domain equation is
formula_33

Applying the Z-transform gives the following relation in the &quot;z&quot; domain:
formula_34

From this relation, we realize that
formula_35

For simplicity, we consider only the case of a rational transfer function . Causality and stability imply that all poles of must be strictly inside the unit circle (see stability). Suppose
formula_36
where and are polynomial in . Causality and stability imply that the poles the roots of must be strictly inside the unit circle. We also know that
formula_37
so causality and stability for formula_38 imply that its poles the roots of must be inside the unit circle. These two constraints imply that both the zeros and the poles of a minimum-phase system must be strictly inside the unit circle.

=== Continuous-time frequency analysis ===

Analysis for the continuous-time case proceeds in a similar manner, except that we use the Laplace transform for frequency analysis. The time-domain equation is
formula_39
where formula_40 is the Dirac delta function the identity operator in the continuous-time case because of the sifting property with any signal :
formula_41

Applying the Laplace transform gives the following relation in the s-plane:
formula_42
from which we realize that
formula_43

Again, for simplicity, we consider only the case of a rational transfer function . Causality and stability imply that all poles of must be strictly inside the left-half s-plane (see stability). Suppose
formula_44
where and are polynomial in . Causality and stability imply that the poles the roots of must be inside the left-half s-plane. We also know that
formula_45
so causality and stability for formula_46 imply that its poles the roots of must be strictly inside the left-half s-plane. These two constraints imply that both the zeros and the poles of a minimum-phase system must be strictly inside the left-half s-plane.

=== Relationship of magnitude response to phase response ===

A minimum-phase system, whether discrete-time or continuous-time, has an additional useful property that the natural logarithm of the magnitude of the frequency response (the &quot;gain&quot; measured in nepers, which is proportional to dB) is related to the phase angle of the frequency response (measured in radians) by the Hilbert transform. That is, in the continuous-time case, let
formula_47
be the complex frequency response of system . Then, only for a minimum-phase system, the phase response of is related to the gain by
formula_48
where formula_49 denotes the Hilbert transform, and, inversely,
formula_50

Stated more compactly, let
formula_51
where formula_52 and formula_53 are real functions of a real variable. Then
formula_54
and
formula_55

The Hilbert transform operator is defined to be
formula_56

An equivalent corresponding relationship is also true for discrete-time minimum-phase systems.

== Minimum phase in the time domain ==
For all causal and stable systems that have the same magnitude response, the minimum-phase system has its energy concentrated near the start of the impulse response. i.e., it minimizes the following function, which we can think of as the delay of energy in the impulse response:
formula_57

== Minimum phase as minimum group delay ==

For all causal and stable systems that have the same magnitude response, the minimum phase system has the minimum group delay. The following proof illustrates this idea of minimum group delay.

Suppose we consider one zero formula_58 of the transfer function formula_59. Let&#x27;s place this zero formula_58 inside the unit circle (formula_61) and see how the group delay is affected.
formula_62

Since the zero formula_58 contributes the factor formula_64 to the transfer function, the phase contributed by this term is the following.
formula_65

formula_66 contributes the following to the group delay.

formula_67

The denominator and formula_68 are invariant to reflecting the zero formula_58 outside of the unit circle, i.e., replacing formula_58 with formula_71. However, by reflecting formula_58 outside of the unit circle, we increase the magnitude of formula_73 in the numerator. Thus, having formula_58 inside the unit circle minimizes the group delay contributed by the factor formula_64. We can extend this result to the general case of more than one zero since the phase of the multiplicative factors of the form formula_76 is additive. I.e., for a transfer function with formula_77 zeros,
formula_78

So, a minimum phase system with all zeros inside the unit circle minimizes the group delay since the group delay of each individual zero is minimized.

== Non-minimum phase ==

Systems that are causal and stable whose inverses are causal and unstable are known as &quot;non-minimum-phase&quot; systems. A given non-minimum phase system will have a greater phase contribution than the minimum-phase system with the equivalent magnitude response.

=== Maximum phase ===

A &quot;maximum-phase&quot; system is the opposite of a minimum phase system. A causal and stable LTI system is a &quot;maximum-phase&quot; system if its inverse is causal and unstable. That is,
* The zeros of the discrete-time system are outside the unit circle.
* The zeros of the continuous-time system are in the right-hand side of the complex plane.
Such a system is called a &quot;maximum-phase system&quot; because it has the maximum group delay of the set of systems that have the same magnitude response. In this set of equal-magnitude-response systems, the maximum phase system will have maximum energy delay.

For example, the two continuous-time LTI systems described by the transfer functions
formula_79

have equivalent magnitude responses; however, the second system has a much larger contribution to the phase shift. Hence, in this set, the second system is the maximum-phase system and the first system is the minimum-phase system. These systems are also famously known as nonminimum-phase systems that raise many stability concerns in control. One recent solution to these systems is moving the RHP zeros to the LHP using the PFCD method.

=== Mixed phase ===

A &quot;mixed-phase&quot; system has some of its zeros inside the unit circle and has others outside the unit circle. Thus, its group delay is neither minimum or maximum but somewhere between the group delay of the minimum and maximum phase equivalent system.

For example, the continuous-time LTI system described by transfer function
formula_80
is stable and causal; however, it has zeros on both the left- and right-hand sides of the complex plane. Hence, it is a &quot;mixed-phase&quot; system. To control the transfer functions that include these systems some methods such as internal model controller (IMC), generalized Smith&#x27;s predictor (GSP) and parallel feedforward control with derivative (PFCD) are proposed.

=== Linear phase ===

A linear-phase system has constant group delay. Non-trivial linear phase or nearly linear phase systems are also mixed phase.

<doc id="548149" wikidata="Q398548" url="?curid=548149" title="Agulhas Current">
<text>The Agulhas Current () is the western boundary current of the southwest Indian Ocean. It flows south along the east coast of Africa from 27°S to 40°S. It is narrow, swift and strong. It is suggested that it is the largest western boundary current in the world ocean, with an estimated net transport of 70 sverdrups (70 million cubic metres per second), as western boundary currents at comparable latitudes transport less — Brazil Current (16.2 Sv), Gulf Stream (34 Sv), Kuroshio (42 Sv).

==Physical properties==
The sources of the Agulhas Current are the East Madagascar Current (25 Sv), the Mozambique Current (5 Sv) and a recirculated part of the south-west Indian subgyre south of Madagascar (35 Sv). The net transport of the Agulhas Current is estimated as 100 Sv. The flow of the Agulhas Current is directed by the topography. The current follows the continental shelf from Maputo to the tip of the Agulhas Bank (250 km south of Cape Agulhas). Here the momentum of the current overcomes the vorticity balance holding the current to the topography and the current leaves the shelf.
The current reaches its maximum transport near the Agulhas Bank where it ranges between 95 and 136 Sv.

The core of the current is defined as where the surface velocities reach , which gives the core an average width of . The mean peak speed is , but the current can reach .

===Agulhas meanders and Natal pulses===
As the Agulhas Current flows south along the African east coast, it tends to bulge inshore frequently, a deviation from the current&#x27;s normal path known as Agulhas Current meanders (ACM). These bulges are occasionally (1-7 times per year) followed by a much larger offshore bulge, known as Natal pulses (NP). Natal pulses move along the coast at per day. An ACM can bulge up to and a NP up to from the current&#x27;s mean position.
The AC passes offshore and an ACM can reach offshore. When the AC meanders, its width broadens from to and its velocity weakens from to . An ACM induces a strong inshore counter-current.

Large-scale cyclonic meanders known as Natal pulses are formed as the Agulhas Current reaches the continental shelf on the South African east-coast (i.e. the eastern Agulhas Bank off Natal). As these pulses moves along the coast on the Agulhas Bank, they tend to pinch off Agulhas rings from the Agulhas Current. Such a ring shedding can be triggered by a Natal pulse alone, but sometimes meanders on the Agulhas Return Current merge to contribute to the shedding of an Agulhas ring.

===Retroflection===
In the southeast Atlantic Ocean the current retroflects (turns back on itself) in the Agulhas Retroflection due to shear interactions with the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, also known as the &quot;West Wind Drift&quot; despite referring to the ocean current rather than to the surface winds. This water becomes the Agulhas Return Current, rejoining the Indian Ocean Gyre. It is estimated that up to 85 Sv (Sv) of the net transport is returned to the Indian Ocean through the retroflection. The remaining water is transported into the South Atlantic Gyre in the Agulhas Leakage. Along with direct branch currents, this leakage takes place in surface water filaments, and Agulhas Eddies.

===Agulhas leakage and rings===

It is estimated that as much as 15 Sv of Indian Ocean water is leaked directly into the South Atlantic. 10 Sv of this is relatively warm, salty thermocline water, with the remaining 5 Sv being cold, low salinity Antarctic Intermediate Water. Since Indian Ocean water is significantly warmer (24-26 °C) and saltier than South Atlantic water, the Agulhas Leakage is a significant source of salt and heat for the South Atlantic Gyre. This heat flux is believed to contribute to the high rate of evaporation in the South Atlantic, a key mechanism in the Meridional Overturning Circulation. A small amount of the Agulhas Leakage joins the North Brazil Current, carrying Indian Ocean water into the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. Before reaching the Caribbean Sea, this leakage gets heated up by the sun around the equator, and, when finally joining the Gulf Stream, this warm and salty water contributes to the formation of deep water in the North Atlantic.

Surface water filaments are estimated to account for up to 13% of the total salt transport from the Agulhas Current into the Benguela Current and South Atlantic Gyre. Due to surface dissipation, these filaments are not believed to significantly contribute to inter-basin heat flux.

Where the Agulhas turns back on itself the loop of the retroflection pinches off periodically, releasing an eddy into the South Atlantic Gyre. These &quot;Agulhas Rings&quot; enter the flow of the Benguela Current or are advected northwestward across the South Atlantic where they join the South Equatorial Current, where they dissipate into the larger background currents. These anticyclonic warm core rings are estimated to have a transport of 3-9 Sv each, in total injecting salt at a rate of 2.5formula_1106 kg/s and heat at a rate of 45 TW.

====Paleoclimate====
Since the Pleistocene, the buoyancy of the South Atlantic thermocline and the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has been regulated by the shedding of warm, saline Agulhas Rings. The Agulhas leakage affects the Atlantic thermocline on a decadal timescale and over centuries it can change the buoyancy of the Atlantic thermocline and therefore the formation rates of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).

The provenance of ocean sediments can be determined by analysing terrigenous strontium isotope ratios in deep ocean cores. Sediments underlying the Agulhas Current and Return Current have significantly higher ratios than surrounding sediments. Franzese et al. 2009 analysed cores in the South Atlantic deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20 000 years ago), and concluded that the Agulhas leakage was significantly reduced. The trajectory of the current was the same during the LGM and that the reduced leakage must be explained by a weaker current. Furthermore, it can be predicted that a stronger Agulhas Current will result in a more eastward retroflection and an increased Agulhas leakage. , however, noted that changes in temperature and salinity in the Agulhas leakage is at least partly the result of variability in the composition in the current itself and can be a poor indicator of the strength of the leakage.

===Rogue waves===
The south-east coast of South Africa is on the main shipping route between the Middle-East and Europe/the U.S. and even large ships have sustained major damage because of rogue waves in the area where these waves occasionally can reach a height of more than . Some 30 larger ships were severely damaged or sunk by rogue waves along the South African east-coast between 1981 and 1991.

===Agulhas Undercurrent===
Directly under the core of the Agulhas Current, at a depth of , there is an Agulhas Undercurrent which flows equatorward. The undercurrent is deep and wide and can reach at , one of greatest speeds observed in any current at this depth, but it also displays a great variance with a transport of 4.2±5.2 Sv. The undercurrent can represent as much as 40% of the Indian Ocean overturning transport.

Below a separate layer of the undercurrent can be distinguished: the more coherent North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) which transports an average of 2.3±3.0 Sv. NADW rounds the southern tip of Africa after which the major part (9 Sv) flow eastward and a smaller part (2 Sv) northward through the Agulhas Undercurrent and into the Natal Valley (the basin between South Africa and the Mocambique Plateau); remnants of NADW has been observed in the Mozambique Basin and Channel. The undercurrent is more leaky than the Agulhas above, resulting in a relatively well-mixed composition of water masses — at intermediate depth there is a mixture of Antarctic Intermediate Water and Read Sea Water.

The periodicity of the meanders and Natal pulses of the Agulhas is matched by the Agulhas Undercurrent. More research is needed but observations seem to indicate that during a meander event the Agulhas moves first onshore, then offshore, and finally onshore again, first weakening then strengthening 10-15 Sv. At the same time the undercurrent is first squeezed offshore and weakened when the Agulhas moves onshore, then strengthened and forced upward when the Agulhas moves offshore, and finally returns to normal.

==Biological properties==
===Primary production===
The Agulhas acts as an oceanic convergence zone. Due to mass continuity this drives surface waters down, resulting in the upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water south of the current. Additionally, the convergence tends to increase the concentration of plankton in and around the Agulhas. Both of these factors result in the area being one of enhanced primary productivity as compared to the surrounding waters. This is especially notable in the Agulhas Retroflection waters, where chlorophyll-a concentrations tend to be significantly higher than the surrounding South Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean waters.

===Impact of rings===
Warm core rings are known to have lower primary productivity than surrounding cold waters. Agulhas Rings are no exception, and have been observed to carry waters with low chlorophyll-a concentration water into the South Atlantic. The size of phytoplankton in Agulhas Rings tends to be smaller than in the surrounding water (around 20 μm in diameter).

Agulhas Rings have also been observed as removing larval and juvenile fish from the continental shelf. This removal of young fish can result in a reduced anchovy catch in the Benguela system if a ring passes through the fishery.

<doc id="548150" wikidata="Q57263" url="?curid=548150" title="William II of Württemberg">
<text>William II (; 25 February 1848 – 2 October 1921) was the last King of Württemberg. He ruled from 6 October 1891 until the dissolution of the kingdom on 30 November 1918. He was the last German ruler to abdicate in the wake of the November Revolution of 1918.

==Early years==
William was born the son of Prince Frederick of Württemberg (1808–1870) by his wife Princess Catherine Frederica of Württemberg (1821–1898), herself the daughter of King William I of Württemberg (1781–1864). His parents were first cousins, being the children of two brothers, and William was their only child.

William&#x27;s growing years coincided with a progressive diminution of Württemberg&#x27;s sovereignty and international presence, concomitant with the process of German unification. In 1870, Württemberg took the side of Prussia in the Franco-German War. In 1871, Württemberg became a state of the German Empire, a significant limitation on its sovereignty.

==King of Württemberg==

William&#x27;s father died in 1870, but his mother lived to see him seated on the throne of Württemberg. In 1891, William succeeded his childless maternal uncle, King Charles I (1823–1891) and became King of Württemberg. This was not, as it may seem, a departure from the Salic law which governed succession in the German states; his claim to the throne came because he was the nearest agnatic heir of his uncle, as the senior male-line descendant of Frederick I of Württemberg through his younger son Prince Paul. 

King William became a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; during World War I. In 1918, he was deposed from the throne along with the other German rulers. King William finally abdicated on 30 November 1918, ending over 800 years of the House of Württemberg rule. He died in 1921 at Bebenhausen.

==Personality and interests==
Considered to be a popular monarch, William had the habit of walking his two dogs in public parks in Stuttgart without being attended by bodyguards or the like. During these excursions, he would often be greeted by his subjects with a simple &quot;Herr König&quot; (&quot;Mister King&quot;).

Despite living in a landlocked kingdom, William II was a yachting enthusiast. The king was instrumental in the establishment of the Württembergischer Yacht Club (formerly &quot;Königlich Württembergischer Yacht-Club&quot; or &quot;Royal Yacht Club of Württemberg&quot;) in 1911 on Lake Constance.

==Marriages and children==
On 15 February 1877 at Arolsen he married Princess Marie of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1857–1882). They had three children:
*Princess Pauline of Württemberg (19 December 18777 May 1965); married in 1898 William Frederick, Prince of Wied (1872–1945), and had issue.
*Prince Ulrich of Württemberg (28 July 188028 December 1880), died in infancy
*A stillborn daughter (24 April 1882)

Marie died on 30 April 1882 in Stuttgart, from complications resulting from the birth of their third child. William, already depressed by the death of his only son, is said never to have recovered from this blow.

Nevertheless, he was King and it was his duty to secure the succession. On 8 April 1886, at Bückeburg, he married Princess Charlotte of Schaumburg-Lippe (1864–1946). They had no children.

==Succession==
On William II&#x27;s death in 1921 without male issue, the royal branch of the House of Württemberg became extinct, and the headship of the house devolved to Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg, head of the Catholic cadet branch of the dynasty, based at Altshausen. Albrecht was a descendant of Alexander of Württemberg, the 7th son of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg (1732–1797).

<text>Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM) is the principal military training centre for the Royal Marines. It is situated near the villages of Lympstone and Exton, between the city of Exeter, and the town of Exmouth in Devon, England.

==History==
The site was established in 1940 as the &quot;Royal Marines Depot Exton&quot; and was renamed the &quot;Royal Marines Depot Lympstone&quot; later in the Second World War. In February 1960, the Commando School Royal Marines, which had been based at Bickleigh Barracks, moved to the site. The site was renamed the &quot;Commando Training Centre Royal Marines&quot; in 1972.

==Organisation==

CTCRM is under the full command of Fleet Commander and responsible for providing commando trained officers and other ranks for the front line. CTCRM is overseen by the Commandant CTCRM, a colonel, Royal Marines. CTCRM is structured with three training wings (Command Wing, Commando Training Wing and Specialist Wing) each with its own commanding officer.

==Courses==
Candidates who wish to become Other Ranks are required to pass Recruit Orientation Phase (ROP) of four weeks before beginning the mainstream 32 weeks training. Before they start ROP they undergo academic, medical and interview assessments. New entry training for Royal Marines other ranks (culminating in a month long &quot;commando course&quot;) is undertaken at CTCRM, at Dartmoor, and at Woodbury Common, Devon, and is conducted over thirty-two weeks. Candidates who pass the commando course receive the award of the green beret, the distinguishing mark of a commando.

Those who wish to become Royal Marine Officers must pass the Potential Officers Course (POC). This is a four-day course that assesses physical and academic ability. Those who pass this and then perform well at the Admiralty Interview Board (AIB) will be offered a place on the Young Officer Training course. This course lasts 15 months, of which 34 weeks are spent at CTCRM and the remainder at Britannia Royal Naval College and on the West Coast of Scotland. CTCRM delivers new entry training to an average of 800 recruits a year. Specialist Wing trains Royal Marines and non-commissioned officers in a wide variety of specialisations e.g.: platoon weapons instructors, mountain leaders, communications and information technology specialists.

==Lympstone Commando==
CTCRM is served by Lympstone Commando railway station on the &quot;Avocet Line&quot;.

==Cadets==
CTCRM is the home of Lympstone Division Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps, which is open to boys and girls aged 9 to 16 (who can serve until aged 18) from the local south east Devon area.

<doc id="548156" wikidata="Q230945" url="?curid=548156" title="State-space representation">
<text>In control engineering and system identification, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system specified as a set of input, output, and variables related by first-order differential equations or difference equations. Such variables, called &quot;state variables&quot;, evolve over time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given instant and on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables’ values depend on the state variable values and may also depend on the input variable values.

The &quot;state space&quot; or &quot;phase space&quot; is the geometric space in which the axes are the state variables. The system state can be represented as a vector, the &quot;state vector&quot;.

If the dynamical system is linear, time-invariant, and finite-dimensional, then the differential and algebraic equations may be written in matrix form. The state-space method is characterized by the algebraization of general system theory, which makes it possible to use Kronecker vector-matrix structures. The capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with or without modulation. The state-space representation (also known as the &quot;time-domain approach&quot;) provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With formula_1 inputs and formula_2 outputs, we would otherwise have to write down formula_3 Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions.

The state-space model can be applied in subjects such as economics, statistics, computer science and electrical engineering, and neuroscience. In econometrics, for example, state-space models can be used to decompose a time series into trend and cycle, compose individual indicators into a composite index, identify turning points of the business cycle, and estimate GDP using latent and unobserved time series. Many applications rely on the Kalman Filter or a state observer to produce estimates of the current unknown state variables using their previous observations.

== State variables ==
The internal state variables are the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent the entire state of the system at any given time. The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, formula_4, is usually equal to the order of the system&#x27;s defining differential equation, but not necessarily. If the system is represented in transfer function form, the minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function&#x27;s denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction. It is important to understand that converting a state-space realization to a transfer function form may lose some internal information about the system, and may provide a description of a system which is stable, when the state-space realization is unstable at certain points. In electric circuits, the number of state variables is often, though not always, the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit such as capacitors and inductors. The state variables defined must be linearly independent, i.e., no state variable can be written as a linear combination of the other state variables, or the system cannot be solved.

== Linear systems ==
The most general state-space representation of a linear system with formula_1 inputs, formula_2 outputs and formula_4 state variables is written in the following form:
formula_8
formula_9
where: (t) := \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In this general formulation, all matrices are allowed to be time-variant (i.e. their elements can depend on time); however, in the common LTI case, matrices will be time invariant. The time variable formula_10 can be continuous (e.g. formula_11) or discrete (e.g. formula_12). In the latter case, the time variable formula_13 is usually used instead of formula_10. Hybrid systems allow for time domains that have both continuous and discrete parts. Depending on the assumptions made, the state-space model representation can assume the following forms:
=== Example: continuous-time LTI case ===
Stability and natural response characteristics of a continuous-time LTI system (i.e., linear with matrices that are constant with respect to time) can be studied from the eigenvalues of the matrix formula_15. The stability of a time-invariant state-space model can be determined by looking at the system&#x27;s transfer function in factored form. It will then look something like this:

formula_16

The denominator of the transfer function is equal to the characteristic polynomial found by taking the determinant of formula_17,
formula_18
The roots of this polynomial (the eigenvalues) are the system transfer function&#x27;s poles (i.e., the singularities where the transfer function&#x27;s magnitude is unbounded). These poles can be used to analyze whether the system is asymptotically stable or marginally stable. An alternative approach to determining stability, which does not involve calculating eigenvalues, is to analyze the system&#x27;s Lyapunov stability.

The zeros found in the numerator of formula_19 can similarly be used to determine whether the system is minimum phase.

The system may still be input–output stable (see BIBO stable) even though it is not internally stable. This may be the case if unstable poles are canceled out by zeros (i.e., if those singularities in the transfer function are removable).

=== Controllability ===
The state controllability condition implies that it is possible – by admissible inputs – to steer the states from any initial value to any final value within some finite time window. A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is controllable if and only if
formula_20
where rank is the number of linearly independent rows in a matrix, and where &quot;n&quot; is the number of state variables.

=== Observability ===
Observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).

A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is observable if and only if
formula_21

=== Transfer function ===
The &quot;transfer function&quot; of a continuous time-invariant linear state-space model can be derived in the following way:

First, taking the Laplace transform of 
formula_22

yields
formula_23
Next, we simplify for formula_24, giving
formula_25
and thus
formula_26

Substituting for formula_24 in the output equation

formula_28
giving
formula_29

Assuming zero initial conditions formula_30 and a single-input single-output (SISO) system, the transfer function is defined as the ratio of output and input formula_31. For a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, however, this ratio is not defined. Therefore, assuming zero initial conditions, the transfer function matrix is derived from
formula_32

using the method of equating the coefficients which yields

formula_33

Consequently, formula_19 is a matrix with the dimension formula_3 which contains transfer functions for each input output combination. Due to the simplicity of this matrix notation, the state-space representation is commonly used for multiple-input, multiple-output systems. The Rosenbrock system matrix provides a bridge between the state-space representation and its transfer function.

=== Canonical realizations ===
Any given transfer function which is strictly proper can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system):

Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:
formula_36

The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:
formula_37

formula_38

This state-space realization is called controllable canonical form because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state).

The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form
formula_39formula_40

This state-space realization is called observable canonical form because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output).

=== Proper transfer functions ===
Transfer functions which are only proper (and not strictly proper) can also be realised quite easily. The trick here is to separate the transfer function into two parts: a strictly proper part and a constant. 
formula_41

The strictly proper transfer function can then be transformed into a canonical state-space realization using techniques shown above. The state-space realization of the constant is trivially formula_42. Together we then get a state-space realization with matrices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; determined by the strictly proper part, and matrix &quot;D&quot; determined by the constant.

Here is an example to clear things up a bit:
formula_43
which yields the following controllable realization
formula_44formula_45
Notice how the output also depends directly on the input. This is due to the formula_46 constant in the transfer function.

=== Feedback ===
A common method for feedback is to multiply the output by a matrix &quot;K&quot; and setting this as the input to the system: formula_47.
Since the values of &quot;K&quot; are unrestricted the values can easily be negated for negative feedback.
The presence of a negative sign (the common notation) is merely a notational one and its absence has no impact on the end results.

formula_48
formula_49

becomes

formula_50
formula_51

solving the output equation for formula_52 and substituting in the state equation results in

formula_53
formula_54

The advantage of this is that the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; can be controlled by setting &quot;K&quot; appropriately through eigendecomposition of formula_55.
This assumes that the closed-loop system is controllable or that the unstable eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; can be made stable through appropriate choice of &quot;K&quot;.

==== Example ====
For a strictly proper system &quot;D&quot; equals zero. Another fairly common situation is when all states are outputs, i.e. &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, which yields &quot;C&quot; = &quot;I&quot;, the identity matrix. This would then result in the simpler equations

formula_56
formula_57

This reduces the necessary eigendecomposition to just formula_58.

=== Feedback with setpoint (reference) input ===
In addition to feedback, an input, formula_59, can be added such that formula_60.

formula_48
formula_49

becomes

formula_63
formula_64

solving the output equation for formula_52 and substituting in the state equation 
results in

formula_66
formula_67

One fairly common simplification to this system is removing &quot;D&quot;, which reduces the equations to

formula_68
formula_69

=== Moving object example ===
A classical linear system is that of one-dimensional movement of an object (e.g., a cart).
Newton&#x27;s laws of motion for an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring:

formula_70

where
*formula_71 is position; formula_72 is velocity; formula_73 is acceleration
*formula_74 is an applied force
*formula_75 is the viscous friction coefficient
*formula_13 is the spring constant
*formula_77 is the mass of the object

The state equation would then become

formula_78
formula_79

where
*formula_80 represents the position of the object
*formula_81 is the velocity of the object
*formula_82 is the acceleration of the object
*the output formula_52 is the position of the object

The controllability test is then

formula_84

which has full rank for all formula_75 and formula_77. This means, that if initial state of the system is known (formula_71, formula_72, formula_73), and if the formula_75 and formula_77 are constants, then there is a force formula_92 that could move the cart into any other position in the system.

The observability test is then

formula_93

which also has full rank. Therefore, this system is both controllable and observable.

== Nonlinear systems ==
The more general form of a state-space model can be written as two functions.

formula_94
formula_95

The first is the state equation and the latter is the output equation.
If the function formula_96 is a linear combination of states and inputs then the equations can be written in matrix notation like above.
The formula_74 argument to the functions can be dropped if the system is unforced (i.e., it has no inputs).

=== Pendulum example ===
A classic nonlinear system is a simple unforced pendulum

formula_98

where
*formula_99 is the angle of the pendulum with respect to the direction of gravity
*formula_77 is the mass of the pendulum (pendulum rod&#x27;s mass is assumed to be zero)
*formula_101 is the gravitational acceleration
*formula_13 is coefficient of friction at the pivot point
*formula_103 is the radius of the pendulum (to the center of gravity of the mass formula_77)
The state equations are then

formula_105
formula_106

where
*formula_107 is the angle of the pendulum
*formula_81 is the rotational velocity of the pendulum
*formula_109 is the rotational acceleration of the pendulum

Instead, the state equation can be written in the general form

formula_110

The equilibrium/stationary points of a system are when formula_111 and so the equilibrium points of a pendulum are those that satisfy

formula_112

for integers &quot;n&quot;.

<text>The brown-backed needletail (Hirundapus giganteus), or brown needletail, is a large swift.

These birds have very short legs which they use only mainly for clinging to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground and spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks.

These swifts are resident breeders in hill forests in southern Asia from India east to Indonesia and the Philippines.

They build their nests in rock crevices in cliffs, laying 3-5 eggs. The flight is impressively fast, even compared to other swifts.

The brown-backed needletail is a very large swift, and at 23 cm is bigger than the Alpine swift and the white-throated needletail. It has a similar build to the latter species, with a heavy barrel-like body. They are dark brown except for a white undertail, which extends on to the flanks.

The &quot;Hirundapus&quot; needletailed swifts get their name from the spined ends of their tail, which is not forked as in the &quot;Apus&quot; typical swifts.

<text>Dunamase or the Rock of Dunamase ( &quot;fort of Másc&quot;) is a rocky outcrop in County Laois, Ireland. Rising above a plain, it has the ruins of Dunamase Castle, a defensive stronghold dating from the early Hiberno-Norman period with a view across to the Slieve Bloom Mountains. It is near the N80 road between the towns of Portlaoise and Stradbally.

==History==


Excavations in the 1990s demonstrated that the Rock was first settled in the 9th century when a hill fort or &quot;dún&quot; was constructed on the site. The first known settlement on the rock was Dun Masc, or Masc’s Fort, an early Christian settlement that was pillaged in 842 by the Vikings. In 845 the Vikings of Dublin attacked the site and the abbot of Terryglass, Aed son of Dub dá Chrích, was killed there. There is no clear evidence of 10th–11th century occupation.

The castle was built in the second half of the 12th century.

When the Normans arrived in Ireland in the late 12th century, Dunamase became the most important Hiberno-Norman fortification in Laois. It was Dunamase where Dermot Mac Morrough, King of Leinster, brought the wife of O&#x27;Rourke, the King of Breifne, after kidnapping her. Enlisting the help of the O&#x27;Connor clan, the O&#x27;Rourkes and O&#x27;Connors drove MacMurrough from Dunamase and he fled Ireland. MacMurrough gave Dunamase and his daughter Aoife in marriage to the Norman conqueror Strongbow in 1170 as part of a deal to enlist his help to regain his lands. The Norman invasion of Ireland then followed when Strongbow accompanied MacMurrough, along with many men, to attack and regain MacMurrogh&#x27;s lands.

Later, with the marriage of Strongbow and Aoife&#x27;s daughter and heir, Isabel, the castle passed into the hands of the Marshal family. William Marshal, who later became Regent of England in the minority of Henry III, had five sons, all of whom succeeded him in turn and died without issue. So in 1247 the Marshal lands were divided among William&#x27;s five daughters. Dunamase fell to Eva Marshal and then to her daughter, Maud, who was married to Roger Mortimer. The castle remained in Mortimer hands until 1330 when another Roger Mortimer was executed for treason. By the time the Mortimer family was rehabilitated the castle seems to have passed out of the area under Norman control. It seems to have become a ruinous shell by 1350.

From the 1400s and until the 16th century it was part of the land of the powerful O&#x27;More (now Moore or Ó Mórdha) family who ruled the county of County Laois for several hundreds of years until the 16th century when they faced great opposition from the English. Rory O&#x27;More famously resisted the English. Hence, County Laois today is still nicknamed &quot;The O&#x27;Moore County&quot;. The O&#x27;More&#x27;s move from Laois to new lands is so memorialised in a 19th-century poem, &quot;Transplanted&quot;, by William O&#x27;Neill:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;But vain I wait and listen for Rory Og is dead,&quot; 
&quot;And in the halls of Dunamase a Saxon rules instead,&quot;
&quot;And o&#x27;er his fruitful acres the stranger now is lord&quot;
&quot;Where since the days of Cuchorb a proud O&#x27;Moore kept ward.&quot; 
&lt;/poem&gt;
The castle was notably owned by, Rory O&#x27;More, Lord of Laois. The O&#x27;Mores left the castle and moved to Kildare, on land granted to them in 1574 by Rory O&#x27;More&#x27;s cousin, Elizabeth I of England. The O&#x27;More family became the Moore family, although in 1751 an O&#x27;More married into the O&#x27;Ferrall family, who subsequently took on the surname More O&#x27;Ferrall. The family had been reduced from one of the most powerful Irish families to standard aristocrats, although the More O&#x27;Ferralls declined a peerage in the 17th century and later a baronetcy in the 19th (they still have the right to use their Irish title, Lord of Laois, and the head of the family is sometimes addressed as so). However, despite the change in status, the family has still played an important role in Irish history since their move. Their former castle played no part in the Cromwellian wars. It was slighted in 1650 to prevent it being used. In the later 18th century Sir John Parnell started to build a banqueting hall within the ruins and this work incorporated medieval architectural details taken from other sites in the area.

<text>In dynamical systems instability means that some of the outputs or internal states increase with time, without bounds. Not all systems that are not stable are unstable; systems can also be marginally stable or exhibit limit cycle behavior.

In structural engineering, a structural beam or column can become unstable when excessive compressive load is applied. Beyond a certain threshold, structural deflections magnify stresses, which in turn increases deflections. This can take the form of buckling or crippling. The general field of study is called structural stability.

Atmospheric instability is a major component of all weather systems on Earth.

==Instability in control systems==
In the theory of dynamical systems, a state variable in a system is said to be unstable if it evolves without bounds. A system itself is said to be unstable if at least one of its state variables is unstable.

In continuous time control theory, a system is unstable if any of the roots of its characteristic equation has real part greater than zero (or if zero is a repeated root). This is equivalent to any of the eigenvalues of the state matrix having either real part greater than zero, or, for the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, the algebraic multiplicity being larger than the geometric multiplicity. The equivalent condition in discrete time is that at least one of the eigenvalues is greater than 1 in absolute value, or that two or more eigenvalues are equal and of unit absolute value.

==Instability in solid mechanics==
* Buckling
* Elastic instability
* Drucker stability of a nonlinear constitutive model
* Biot instability (surface wrinkling in elastomers)
* Baroclinic instability 

==Fluid instabilities==

Fluid instabilities occur in liquids, gases and plasmas, and are often characterized by the shape that form; they are studied in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. Fluid instabilities include:

* Ballooning instability (some analogy to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability); found in the magnetosphere
* Atmospheric instability
** Hydrodynamic instability or dynamic instability (atmospheric dynamics)
*** Inertial instability; baroclinic instability; symmetric instability, conditional symmetric or convective symmetric instability; barotropic instability; Helmholtz or shearing instability; rotational instability
** Hydrostatic instability or static instability/vertical instability (parcel instability), thermodynamic instability (atmospheric thermodynamics)
*** Conditional or static instability, buoyant instability, latent instability, nonlocal static instability, conditional-symmetric instability; convective, potential, or thermal instability, convective instability of the first and second kind; absolute or mechanical instability
* Bénard instability
* Drift mirror instability
* Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (similar, but different from the diocotron instability in plasmas)
* Rayleigh–Taylor instability
* Saffman–Taylor instability
* Plateau-Rayleigh instability (similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability)
* Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability)
* Shock Wave Instability
* Benjamin-Feir Instability (also known as modulational instability)

==Plasma instabilities==

Plasma instabilities can be divided into two general groups (1) hydrodynamic instabilities (2) kinetic instabilities. Plasma instabilities are also categorised into different modes – see this paragraph in plasma stability.

==Instabilities of stellar systems==

Galaxies and star clusters can be unstable, if small perturbations in the gravitational potential cause changes in the density that reinforce the original perturbation. Such instabilities usually require that the motions of stars be highly correlated, so that the perturbation is not &quot;smeared out&quot; by random motions. After the instability has run its course, the system is typically &quot;hotter&quot; (the motions are more random) or rounder than before. Instabilities in stellar systems include:

* Bar instability of rapidly rotating disks
* Jeans instability
* Firehose instability
* Gravothermal instability
* Radial-orbit instability
* Various instabilities in cold rotating disks

==Joint instabilities==
The most common residual disability after any sprain in the body is instability. Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed the physiological limits. Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the injured joint. Injuries cause proprioceptive deficits and impaired postural control in the joint. Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to injury than those with better postural control. Instability leads to an increase in postural sway, the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal center of pressure. The measurement of a subject&#x27;s postural sway can be calculated through testing center of pressure (CoP), which is defined as the vertical projection of center of mass on the ground. Investigators have theorized that if injuries to joints cause deafferentation, the interruption of sensory nerve fibers, and functional instability, then a subject&#x27;s postural sway should be altered. Joint stability can be enhanced by the use of an external support system, like a brace, to alter body mechanics. The mechanical support provided by a brace provides cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control and increasing stability.

<text>The Long Walk of the Navajo, also called the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo (), was the deportation and ethnic cleansing of the Navajo people by the United States federal government and the United States army. Navajos were forced to walk from their land in western New Mexico Territory (modern-day Arizona and New Mexico) to Bosque Redondo in eastern New Mexico. Some 53 different forced marches occurred between August 1864 and the end of 1866. In total, 10,000 Navajos and 500 Mescalero Apache were forced to the internment camp in Bosque Redondo. During the forced march and internment, up to 3,500 people died from starvation and disease over a four-year period. In 1868, the Navajo were allowed to return to their ancestral homeland following the Treaty of Bosque Redondo. Some anthropologists state that the &quot;collective trauma of the Long Walk ... is critical to contemporary Navajos&#x27; sense of identity as a people&quot;.

==Background==
The traditional Navajo homeland spans from Arizona through New Mexico. Navajo built houses, planted crops, and raised livestock there. Groups or bands raided and traded with each other, making and breaking treaties. This included interactions between the Navajo, Spanish, Mexican, Pueblos, Apache, Comanche, Ute, and later American settlers. Any of them could be victims of these conflicts and also instigate conflicts to pursue their interests.

Hostilities escalated between American settlers and Navajos following the scalping of respected Navajo leader Narbona in 1849. In August 1851, Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner established Fort Defiance for the U.S. government (near present-day Window Rock, Arizona) and Fort Wingate (originally Fort Fauntleroy near Gallup, New Mexico). Prior to the Long Walk, treaties were signed in 1849, 1858, and 1861.

===Navajo–Army conflicts===

Friction between invading American settlers and Navajo groups was widespread between 1846 and 1863. Manuelito and Barboncito reminded the Navajo that the US Army was sending troops to wage war, that it had flogged a Navajo messenger, and that it opened fire on tribal headsman “Agua Chiquito”, during talks for peace. They argued that the army had refused to bring in feed for their animals at Ft. Defiance, took over the prime grazing land, and killed Manuelito&#x27;s livestock there. On April 30, 1860, Manuelito and Barboncito with 1,000 Navajo warriors attacked the fort and almost took control.

Truces and treaties committed the Army to protect the Navajo. However, the Army allowed other Native American tribes and Mexicans to steal livestock and enslave Navajos. A truce was signed on February 15, 1861. They were again promised protection, but as part of the truce, two of the Navajo&#x27;s four sacred mountains were taken from them, as well as about one-third of their traditional land. In March, a company of 52 citizens led by Jose Manuel Sanchez drove off a bunch of Navajo horses, but Captain Wingate followed the trail and recovered them for the Navajo, who had killed Sanchez. Another group of settlers ravaged Navajo rancherias in the vicinity of Beautiful Mountain. Also, during this time, a party of Mexicans and Pueblo Indians captured 12 Navajo in a raid, and three were brought in.

On August 9, 1861, Lt. Col. Manuel Antonio Chaves of the New Mexico Volunteer Militia took command of a garrison of three companies numbering 8 officers and 206 men at Fort Fauntleroy. Chaves was later accused of holding back supplies intended for the 1,000 or more Navajos who had remained close to the fort and was maintaining only lax discipline. Horse races began on September 10 and continued into the late afternoon of September 13. Col. Chaves permitted Post Sutler A. W. Kavanaugh to supply liquor to the Navajos. A dispute emerged about which horse won a race. A shot rang out, followed by a fusillade. Almost immediately 200 Navajo, well-armed and mounted, advanced toward the Guard, shooting at the men. They were fired upon by the soldiers and scattered, leaving 12 dead and forty prisoners. On hearing this, General Canby demanded a report from Chaves, who did not comply. Canby sent Captain Andrew W. Evans to the fort, named Fort Lyon on September 25, who took command. Manuel Chaves, suspended from command, was confined to Albuquerque pending court-martial. (The charges were dismissed after two months.) In February 1861, Chaves took the field with 400 militia and ransacked Navajo land, without federal authority.

===Civil War and Kit Carson===

With Confederate troops moving into southern New Mexico, Canby sent Agent John Ward into Navajo lands to persuade any who might be friendly to move to a central encampment near the village of Cubero. In return they would be offered government protection. Ward was instructed to warn all Navajos who refused to come that they would be treated as enemies; many came. Evans was overseeing the abandonment of Fort Lyon and had been told that the new policy was that the Navajo had to be removed to settlements or pueblos, mentioning the region of the Little Colorado west of Zuni as possibly an ideal place. In November, some Navajo started raiding again. On December 1, Canby wrote to his superior in St. Louis that &quot;recent occurrences in the Navajo country have so demoralized and broken up [the Navajo] nation that there is now no choice between their absolute extermination or their removal and colonization at points so remote...as to isolate them entirely from the inhabitants of the Territory. Aside from all considerations of humanity, the extermination of such a people will be the work of the greatest difficulty.&quot;

By 1862, the Union Army had pushed the Confederates down the Rio Grande. The United States government again determined to eliminate Navajo raiding and raids on the Navajo. James H. Carleton was ordered to relieve Canby as Commander for the New Mexico Military Department in September 1862. Carleton ordered Colonel Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Carson to proceed to Navajo territory and to receive the Navajo surrender on July 20, 1863. When no Navajos showed up, Carson and another officer entered Navajo territory in an attempt to persuade Navajos to surrender and used a scorched earth policy to starve the Navajo out of their traditional homeland and force them to surrender. By early 1864 thousands of Navajo began surrendering. Some Navajos refused and scattered to Navajo Mountain, the Grand Canyon, the territory of the Chiricahua Apache, and to parts of modern day Utah.

==The Long Walk==
Major General James H. Carleton was assigned to the New Mexico Territory in the fall of 1862, it is then that he would subdue the Navajos of the region and force them on the long walk to Bosque Redondo. Upon being assigned the territory Carleton set boundaries in which the Navajos would not engage in any sort of conflict. They were prohibited from trespassing onto lands, raiding neighboring tribes, and engaging in warfare with both the Spaniards and European Americans. A majority of the Navajos were abiding by these requirements, but a band of Navajo freelancing raiding parties broke these rules, for which the entire tribe was penalized. In the eyes of Carleton, he was unsuccessful and enlisted outside resources for aid including famous mountain man Kit Carson.

Carson also enlisted neighboring tribes in aiding his campaign to capture as many Navajos as he could. One tribe that proved to be most useful was the Utes. The Utes were very knowledgeable of the lands of the Navajos and were very familiar with Navajo strongholds as well. Carson launched his full-scale assault on the Navajo population in January 1864. He destroyed everything in his path, eradicating the way of life of the Navajo people. Hogans were burned to the ground, livestock was killed off, and irrigated fields were destroyed. Navajos who surrendered were taken to Fort Canby and those who resisted were murdered. Some Navajos were able to escape Carson&#x27;s campaign but were soon forced to surrender due to starvation and the freezing temperature of the winter months.

The &quot;Long Walk&quot; started at the beginning of spring 1864. Bands of Navajo led by the Army were relocated from their traditional lands in eastern Arizona Territory and western New Mexico Territory to Fort Sumner (in an area called the Bosque Redondo or by the Navajo) in the Pecos River valley (Bosque Redondo is Spanish for &quot;round forest&quot;—in New Mexican Spanish a &quot;bosque&quot; means a river-bottom forest usually containing cottonwood trees). The march was very difficult and pushed many Navajos to their breaking point. Many began the walk exhausted and malnourished, others were not properly clothed and were not in the least prepared for such a long journey. They were also treated cruelly by the soldiers leading the march. They were never informed as to where they were going, why they were being relocated, or how long it would take to get there. One account passed through generations within the Navajos shows the attitude of the U.S. Army:

It was said that those ancestors were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn&#x27;t keep up with the others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold up for a while and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn&#x27;t do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. &quot;Your daughter is not going to survive, anyway; sooner or later she is going to die,&quot; they said in their own language. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; the daughter said to her parents, &quot;things might come out all right with me,&quot; But the poor thing was mistaken, my grandparents used to say. Not long after they had moved on, they heard a gunshot from where they had been a short time ago.

At least 200 died during the 18-day, 300-mile (500-km) trek. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people were settled on an area of 40 square miles (104 km2), with a peak population of 9,022 by the spring of 1865.

There were as many as 50 groups taking one of seven known routes. They each took a different path but were on the same trail. When returning to the Navajo lands, they reformed their group to become one; this group was ten miles (16 km) long. Some of these Navajos escaped and hid with Apaches that were running from Gen. Crook on what is known as Cimmaron Mesa southeast of present-day NM Highway 6 and I-40; later they relocated to Alamo Springs northwest of Magdalena, NM and are known as the Alamo Band of the Diné (Navajos). Nelson Anthony Field who had a trading post made a trip to DC to lobby for a reservation for this Band and it was granted. This Band is part Navajo and part Apache.

===Slavery===
The campaign to subdue the Navajo by the Army was supplemented by raids by New Mexican and Ute slavers who fell on isolated bands of Navajo, killing the men, taking the women and children captive, and capturing horses and livestock. During the army campaign the Ute scouts attached to the army unit engaged in this activity and left destruction of Navajo infrastructure to the main army unit. Following the surrender of the Navajo, the Utes continued to raid the Navajo as did New Mexican slavers. A large number of slaves were taken and sold throughout the region.

==Bosque Redondo==

Like some internment camps involving several tribes, the Bosque Redondo had serious problems. About 400 Mescalero Apaches were placed there before the Navajos. The Mescaleros and the Navajo had a long tradition of raiding each other; the two tribes had many disputes during their encampment. Upon arriving at Bosque Redondo, it was forbidden for the Navajo to speak their native language or practice any cultural customs. Furthermore, the initial plan was for around 5,000 people, nowhere near the 10,000 men, women, and children who eventually resided in the camp. Water and firewood were major issues from the start; the water was brackish, and the round grove of trees was quite small. Nature and humans both caused crop failures every year. The corn crop was infested with army worms and failed repeatedly. The Pecos River flooded and washed out the head gates of the irrigation system. In 1865 Navajo began leaving. By 1867 the remaining Navajo refused to plant a crop. Comanches raided them frequently, and they raided the Comanche, once stealing over 1,000 horses. The non-Indian settlers also suffered from the raiding parties who were trying to feed their starving people on the Bosque Redondo. There was inept management of the supplies purchased for the reservation. The army spent as much as $1.5 million a year to feed the Native Americans. In 1868 the experiment—meant to be the first Indian reservation west of Indian Territory—was abandoned. A memorial site honoring those who were incarcerated at Bosque Redondo is located at Fort Sumner, New Mexico.

==Treaty of Bosque Redondo==

The Treaty of Bosque Redondo between the United States and many of the Navajo leaders was concluded at Fort Sumner on June 1, 1868. Some of the provisions included establishing a reservation, restrictions on raiding, a resident Indian Agent and agency, compulsory education for children, the supply of seeds, agricultural implements and other provisions, rights of the Navajos to be protected, establishment of railroads and forts, compensation to tribal members, and arrangements for the return of Navajos to the reservation established by the treaty. The Navajo agreed for ten years to send their children to school and the U.S. government agreed to establish schools with teachers for every thirty Navajo children. The U.S. government also promised for ten years to give to the Navajos annually: clothing, goods, and other raw materials, not exceeding the value of five dollars per person, that the Navajos could not manufacture for themselves.

The signers of the document were: W. T. Sherman (Lt. General), S. F. Tappan (Indian Peace Commissioner), Navajos Barboncito (Chief), Armijo, Delgado, Manuelito, Largo, Herrero, Chiquito, Muerte de Hombre, Hombro, Narbono, Narbono Segundo and Ganado Mucho. Those who attested the document included Theo H. Dodd (Indian Agent) and B. S. Roberts (General 3rd Cav).

==Return and end of Long Walk==

On June 18, 1868, the once-scattered bands of people who call themselves &quot;Diné&quot;, set off together on the return journey, the &quot;Long Walk&quot; home. This is one of the few instances where the U.S. government permitted a tribe to return to their traditional boundaries. The Navajo were granted 3.5 million acres (14,000 km2) of land inside their four sacred mountains. The Navajo also became a more cohesive tribe after the Long Walk and were able to successfully increase the size of their reservation since then, to over 16 million acres (70,000 km2).

After relating 20 pages of material concerning the Long Walk, Howard Gorman, age 73 at the time, concluded:

===Health effects===
Not all the Navajo were captured and forced to take the long walk. Geneticists believe that a genetic bottleneck developed among the small, isolated, uncaptured groups. This produced the consequence of otherwise rare genetic diseases, for example xeroderma pigmentosum, stemming from recessive genes achieving greater dominance. An alternative put forth by some Navajo is that the sudden rise of xeroderma pigmentosum is directly related to widespread contamination from uranium mining.

===In art===

Navajo artist Richard K. Yazzie created a mural entitled &quot;Long Walk Home&quot; for the city of Gallup, New Mexico. It is located at the intersection of Third and Hill streets. It is rendered in the four &quot;sacred colors&quot;, black, white, blue and yellow.

=== In music ===
A famous song was composed by the Navajo when they were set free about their return to their homeland, &quot;Shí naashá (I am going).&quot;

===In literature===
A supposed remnant of the Long Walk from Bosque Redondo, a rug called Woven Sorrow, figures prominently as a valuable antique in the plot of &quot;The Shape Shifter&quot; by Tony Hillerman, published in 2006. Anne Hillerman mentioned the Long Walk in a subsequent novel in the series, &quot;Cave of Bones&quot; (2018).

The story of the forced relocation is the setting of the youth fiction novel &quot;The Girl Who Chased Away Sorrow&quot;, written in 1999 by Ann Turner.

In the 1979 Stephen King novel &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (written under the pen name Richard Bachman) two Hopis are among one hundred teenage boys who participate in a competitive and voluntary death march which serves as a macabre annual spectacle in a totalitarian re-imagining of America.

Scott O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s Newbury Award-winning book &quot;Sing Down the Moon&quot; (1970) depicts the forced migration of the Navajos to Bosque Redondo.

<doc id="548186" wikidata="Q1497474" url="?curid=548186" title="Pamela Green">
<text>Phyllis Pamela Green (28 March 1929 – 7 May 2010) was an English glamour model and actress, best known at the end of the 1950s and early 1960s. She modeled for Zoltán Glass and his brother Stephen, Bill Brandt, Joan Craven, Bertram Park, George Pickow and John Everard.

==Early life==
Pamela Green was born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, England on 28 March 1929. She grew up in West Wickham, after which she attended Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in central London; she started figure modelling to pay for her art school studies and moved on to photographic modelling because it paid more. She also worked as a dancer and appeared in the Latin Quarter at The London Casino (aka Prince Edward Theatre) and Bernard Delfont&#x27;s Folies Bergère at the Hippodrome, London. Early in her career, while still at art college, Pamela Green was photographed by Bill Brandt, Zoltán Glass and Angus McBean.
In 1954 Green started to supply the bookshops and newsagents of London&#x27;s Soho with her own postcard sets of glamour photographs, to supplement her work as a photographer&#x27;s model. In 1955 Luxor Press published a pictorial monograph on Green featuring the photographs of George Harrison Marks, entitled &quot;Pamela&quot;.

==Career==
Her rising profile prompted her to set up Kamera Publications Ltd with Harrison Marks. With Green as Managing Director, they produced several magazines, with &quot;Kamera&quot; being the most successful. It was the first glamour magazine of any note in the UK, and heralded the top-shelf magazine industry in the country. As their success grew they ventured into 8mm cine film production, which was the format commonly used for home viewing.
Her first film appearance was in Michael Powell&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960). Green appeared in the nudist film &quot;Naked as Nature Intended&quot; (1961), released in the United States as &quot;As Nature Intended&quot;, written and directed by Marks.
In 1961, Green&#x27;s personal relationship with Marks ended, but they continued their business relationship. By the mid-&#x27;60s Harrison Marks was increasingly preoccupied by film making. &quot;Kamera&quot; ceased publication in 1968. He always acknowledged his debt to Pamela Green and said in his biography &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, &quot;Pam set me up. She started it all.&quot; In 1964 she appeared in an episode of &quot;This Week&quot;.
Green continued to model for her then-partner, the photographer Douglas Webb. She became Webb&#x27;s camera stills assistant and worked for the major film companies in London. In 1992 she wrote the foreword to David McGillivray&#x27;s book &quot;Doing Rude Things&quot;, which was reprinted in 2017. A television version of &quot;Doing Rude Things&quot; was produced by the BBC in 1995, in which she was interviewed.

==Personal life==
In September 1951, Green married stagehand Guy Hillier, however, they separated after one month and eventually got divorced in 1965. From 1953 to 1961 she lived with George Harrison Marks and took his name. Her third partner was the photographer Douglas Webb, with whom Green lived until his death in December 1996. At first they lived in a Victorian villa on the Isle of Wight and in 1993 they moved to a terraced house in Yarmouth, where Green was a member of the Yarmouth Women&#x27;s Institute.
Pamela Green died from leukaemia, aged 81, on the Isle of Wight on 7 May 2010.

<text>The Petlyakov Pe-2 ( — nickname «Пешка» (Pawn); NATO reporting name: Buck) was a Soviet twin-engine dive bomber used during World War II. One of the outstanding tactical attack aircraft of the war, it also proved successful as a heavy fighter, as a night fighter (Pe-3 variant) and as a reconnaissance aircraft. The Pe-2 was, numerically, the most important Soviet bomber of World War II, at their peak comprising 75% of the Soviet twin-engine bomber force. The Soviets manufactured Pe-2s in greater numbers (11,430 built) during the war than any other twin-engine combat aircraft except for the German Junkers Ju 88 and the British Vickers Wellington. Several Soviet bloc air forces flew the type after the war, when it became known by the NATO reporting name Buck.

==Development==
In 1937, Vladimir Petlyakov was the leader of the Heavy Aircraft Brigade at the Tupolev OKB responsible for the development of the ANT-42 four-engined long-range bomber (which would eventually enter service as the TB-7/Pe-8). However, that same year saw the start of Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, and none were spared suspicion; Andrei Tupolev, the head of the OKB, was coerced into signing a &quot;confession&quot; in October 1937 that he had formed an anti-Soviet group that included Petlyakov, and both men along with many others were arrested.

Too valuable to be simply executed, unlike many others arrested during the Great Purge, Petlyakov and other weapons designers were instead sent to &quot;sharashkas&quot;, special prisons run by the NKVD where such valuable prisoners could continue their work under close scrutiny. In 1938, Petlyakov was tasked with leading the first Special Technical Department (STO — &quot;SpetsTekhOd&#x27;yel&quot;) for aviation that also included other future well-known designers such as Vladimir Myasishchev, a colleague of Petlyakov&#x27;s at the Tupolev OKB.

=== VI-100 ===
Because the Russian word for &quot;100&quot; is &quot;sto&quot;(&quot;сто&quot;), the STO was later renamed KB-100, and there Petlyakov proposed the development of a twin-engine interceptor against high-altitude long-range bombers, particularly those being developed in Germany such as the Junkers Ju 86P and Henschel Hs 130. His proposal was accepted in March 1938, with the requirement that the first prototype be ready for its first flight before the end of 1939. The project was initially given the name Samolyot 100 (lit. &quot;Aircraft 100&quot;) and later called VI-100 (&quot;Vysotnyi Istrebitel&quot; — &quot;High-Altitude Fighter&quot;).

The VI-100 project was an ambitious one for its time, with advanced features such as a pressurised cabin, all-metal construction, turbo-superchargers, and many electrically actuated systems. In addition, the performance requirements were also quite demanding: it was to be capable of reaching 630 km/h (391 mph) at an altitude of 10,000 m, a ceiling of 12,500 m, and a range of 1,400 km. The aircraft would also need a reinforced structure in order to withstand the Mach stresses of making diving attacks from high altitude against enemy bomber formations. In order to assist with the challenging development of the &quot;100&quot;, other OKBs such as those of Yakovlev, Mikoyan &amp; Gurevich, and Sukhoi were also enlisted. The first full-scale VI-100 mock-up was completed in May 1939, and the first flight of the prototype occurred on 22 December 1939.

The VI-100 was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by two Klimov M-105R engines, licence-built Hispano-Suiza 12Y engines that were the most advanced then available in the Soviet Union, driving VISh-42 three-blade variable-pitch propellers, enhanced by two TK-3 turbo-superchargers fitted in the engine nacelles. Its primary armament were two 20 mm ShVAK cannon and two 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, with another ShKAS machine gun in a fixed mounting in the tailcone for self-defence. The first prototype VI-100 was also designed to carry KS-76 (48 modified 76 mm artillery shells with timed fuses) or KS-100 (96 AO-25 bomblets) cassettes in the fuselage for dropping on enemy bomber formations. The second prototype was instead fitted with external bomb racks for 1,000 kg of bombs and internal bomb bays for 600 kg of bombs instead of the cassettes of the first prototype.

The first VI-100 prototype was demonstrated publicly during the 1940 May Day parade, flown by Maj. Stefanovsky, as Petlyakov and his team watched on from the roofs of their &quot;sharashka&quot;. During testing in 1940, the second prototype VI-100 suffered a cockpit fire due to an improperly tightened nut in the fuel supply and crashed into a kindergarten, killing a group of young children and a teacher. Despite the loss of the second prototype and several defects being found in the first prototype, the VI-100 was judged satisfactory and suitable for further development. Its performance was superior to other Soviet high altitude fighters such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-200 (the future MiG-3), and compared favourably with contemporary aircraft such as the Potez 630, Messerschmitt Bf 110 C, and Bristol Beaufighter Mk. I. However, events were to lead to substantial changes in the direction of the VI-100 project.

=== PB-100 ===
The value of tactical dive bombing had been proven by the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the Blitzkrieg campaigns of 1939 and 1940, and the need for such an aircraft in the VVS-RKKA (Workers &amp; Peasants&#x27; Red Army Air Force) suddenly became very apparent. Furthermore, following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact, Soviet experts were able to visit German aircraft factories, where they discovered that Germany had no large-scale development of high-altitude long-range bombers underway. Existing aircraft were also judged to be within the capabilities of single-engined fighters like the I-200.

As a result, in May 1940, it was decided that a dive-bomber using the good aerodynamics of the VI-100 would be designed and put into production. The new aircraft, now designated the PB-100 (&quot;Pikiruyushchiy Bombardirovshchik&quot; — &quot;Dive-Bomber&quot;), was required to achieve a maximum speed of 535 km/h at an altitude of 4800–4900 m, a range of 1,600 km at an altitude of 5,000 m, and a ceiling of 8000 m. Petlyakov and his team were instructed to redesign the two-seat high altitude fighter into a three-seat dive-bomber within 45 days. In order to meet this deadline, Petlyakov&#x27;s team were assisted by some 300 specialists from other OKBs.

The fuselage of the VI-100 had to be redesigned for the dive-bombing role. Initially, the PB-100 featured three pressurised cabins for the three-man crew, but the VVS judged that pressurisation was an inessential luxury for the dive-bombing role, and this was dropped. Furthermore, the high altitude performance provided by the turbo-superchargers was also unnecessary, and these too were dropped. Extensive glazing was added to the lower portion of the nose to give the pilot maximum visibility during a dive-bombing attack. A bomb bay for a single 100 kg bomb was added in each engine nacelle, while the engines remained the same. The wing was modified, with dive brakes added. The cockpit was redesigned, bringing the navigator and pilot together, and given extensive glazing, while a defensive machine gun was added in the ventral position, operated by a gunner.

The redesign was completed in time, and the PB-100 was ordered into production without the construction of a prototype (only static tests were conducted for new components such as the fuselage), with the first two series production PB-100s completed by Zavod 39 in the late autumn of 1940. The trials of the lead machine (No. 390101) began on 15 December 1940. In accordance with the new rules also adopted in December 1940, the aircraft was also redesignated Pe-2 2M-105.

== Design features ==
The Pe-2 inherited the basic low-wing twin-engine monoplane configuration of the VI-100. It had an all-metal stressed-skin structure, with cloth only used to cover the ailerons and control surfaces. The tail had twin fins and rudders with a pronounced 8-degree dihedral on the tailplane; this had been added to the PB-100 to correct the poor lateral stability found on the VI-100 during testing.

The wing design of the Pe-2 was also inherited from the VI-100, but this had been optimised for high altitude performance at the cost of lower lift at low altitude, resulting in suboptimal manoeuvreability and take-off and landing characteristics. For example, while the Pe-2&#x27;s flying characteristics were generally good once it was airborne, it took a good amount of force to pull the elevators up to rotate the plane for takeoff. Russian night bombing missions often flew with female pilots, and some of the women were not strong enough to get the airplane airborne by themselves. When such a situation occurred, the procedure was to have the navigator get behind the pilot&#x27;s seat and wrap her arms around the control wheel and help the pilot pull the wheel back. Once the aircraft was airborne, the navigator returned to her duties and the pilot continued to fly the plane without assistance. In addition, the Pe-2 had a reputation for hard landings, as well as for its notorious &quot;bounce&quot; on landing due to the inadequate shock absorbers in the landing gear. This could be fatal if the pilot was not prepared for it. As designed, the wings were also fitted with &quot;Venetian blind&quot;-type slatted dive brakes for the dive-bombing role.

Pe-2s were equipped with an inert gas fire-suppression system for the self-sealing fuel tanks, which progressively filled the fuel tanks with nitrogen in order to reduce the risk of ignition when hit by enemy fire.

=== Armament ===

The Pe-2 had an internal capacity for six 100 kg bombs, for a total of 600 kg; this was no better than that of the older Tupolev SB bomber. The internal capacity consisted of a fuselage bomb bay capable of carrying four 100 kg bombs or an additional fuel tank, with two small internal bomb bays in the rear of the engine nacelles for a single 100 kg bomb each. This was supplemented by four external underwing racks. These were capable of carrying four 100 kg or 250 kg bombs, or two 500 kg bombs in overload configuration, giving a maximum bombload of 1,000 kg. Only the bombs in the external racks could be used in a dive-bombing attack; the internally carried bombs had no dive release gear and could not be dropped in a steep dive.

The offensive armament originally consisted of two 7.62 mm ShKAS fixed forward-firing machine guns in the nose. The right ShKAS was replaced by the more powerful 12.7 mm UBK heavy machine gun from Series 13 production aircraft onwards. From Series 32 onwards, provisions were made for underwing guide rails for up to ten RS-132 or RS-82 unguided rockets.

The defensive armament originally consisted of a single ShKAS machine gun in a dorsal TSS mounting, later MV-3 turret, manned by the navigator in the cockpit behind the pilot, and a ventral 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun in a mounting in the fuselage behind the bomb bay aimed by a periscope. This defensive armament was found to be totally inadequate: from Series 13 onwards, the ventral ShKAS was replaced by one 12.7 mm UBT in an MV-2 mounting, while the dorsal ShKAS was also replaced by a UBT in various different mountings, some modified in the field and others from the factory:
* MV-7 turret: Turret mounting tested in September 1941. Unsatisfactory and not adopted.
* FT (&quot;Frontovoye Trebovaniye&quot; — &quot;Frontline Demand&quot;) mounting: designed by Leonid Selyakov at Zavod 22 in response to the requests of Pe-2 crews to fit the standard Pe-2 with minimal changes to production and can be fitted in the field. Standardised from Series 83 onwards. This mounting required the canopy over the navigator to be removed, resulting in reduced comfort for the navigator manning the gun.
* VUB-1 turret: Turret mounting, standardised from Series 110 onwards. Pe-2s with this mounting are often known as &quot;Pe-2FT&quot; in Western literature, even though the VUB-1 turret has no connection to the actual FT mounting whatsoever.
* FZ (&quot;Frontovoye Zadaniye&quot; — &quot;Frontline Mission&quot;) turret: Experimental turret mounting introduced in 1943. Uses magazines for the UBT instead of belts for easier and faster handling of the turret. Tests were successful, recommended for production, but not adopted in order to not disrupt Pe-2 production.

The replacement of the ShKAS defensive guns with the UBT was reported to increase the life expectancy of a Pe-2 from 20 sorties to 54.

==Operational service==
The Pe-2 was first publicly demonstrated in the May Day Parade of 1941. Testing of the Pe-2 was completed and it was accepted for service in June 1941, shortly before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During the early stages of the invasion, Pe-2 crews, who were poorly trained and unfamiliar with their new aircraft, were often sent on near-suicidal low-level bombing missions against advancing German forces, where they were highly vulnerable to light anti-aircraft guns and German fighters, or bombed from altitude with minimal accuracy and effectiveness against moving troops.

The aircraft did not show its true potential until the end of 1941, after the Soviet Air Force had a chance to regroup after the German onslaught, during the Winter. The Pe-2 quickly proved itself to be a highly capable aircraft, able to elude the Luftwaffe&#x27;s interceptors and allowing their crews to develop great accuracy with their bombing. It could give German fighters fits when it could outrun them, at times reaching over .

The records of the 16th and 39th BAPs of the Western Front Air Force note that the Pe-2&#x27;s crews had the greatest success in repelling the attacks of enemy fighters in June and July 1941. On 1 July, for example, six Pe-2s fended off attacks by four Messerschmitt Bf 109s, shooting down two of them. A week later a group of Pe-2s was attacked by four Bf 109s and again brought down two of the attackers. On both occasions the Petlyakovs suffered no losses. On the southern front, a bombing mission against Ploiești, in Romania, by six Pe-2s, led by Capt. A. Tsurtsulin, was a great success: of petroleum were burnt in the raid. The Romanian information agency claimed that at least 100 Soviet planes had bombed Ploiești.

The Pe-2 regiments&#x27; operations were not always successful and the service pilots complained about insufficient defensive armament and survivability: there was a great risk of fire and insufficient armour protection, especially for the navigators and gunners. German pilots soon discovered the limited sighting angles of the ventral gun mounting and its poor reliability. The ammunition belt of the UBT machine-gun often jammed after the first burst of fire when shooting in extreme positions. The navigator and the radio operator were poorly protected. On average, ten Pe-2 gunners were wounded for every pilot, and two or three were killed for the loss of one pilot.

Throughout 1942 the design was steadily refined and improved, in direct consultation with pilots who were actually flying them in combat. Improved armour protection and a fifth ShKAS machine-gun was installed and fuel tanks modified. Despite anecdotal reports by Soviet fliers, Pe-2s were daylight bombers, often crewed by comparative novices in the early years of the war, and took significant losses, even when well protected by fighters. In December 1942 General of the Soviet Air Force estimated the life expectancy of a Pe-2 was 30 combat flights. An example of loss rates after the Soviets gained the upper hand can be gained by the losses suffered by the 1st and 2nd BAK. The former started the month of July 1943 with 179 machines, and lost 52 that month, and 59 the next, ending August with 156 bombers after receiving replacements. The 2nd BAK started July with 122 Pe-2s, with monthly losses of 30 and 20, ending August 1943 with 114 Pe-2s after replacements arrived. Most of these losses were at the hands of the thinly stretched German fighter groups, which continued to inflict significant losses when present in strength, even in the closing months of the war. For example, in the Baltic where JG54 Grünherz were the main opposition, and greatly outnumbered, the Soviet 1st Gv BAK lost 86 Pe-2s shot down (another 12 to other causes), mostly to German fighters between 23 July 1944 and 8 February 1945. Western sources use mark Pe-2FT for production series after 83, where FT stands for Frontovoe Trebovanie (Frontline Request), although Soviet documents do not use this identification. Final versions Pe-2K (transitional version of Pe-2I) and Pe-2I were produced in small numbers, due to the unwillingness of Soviet industry to decelerate production numbers.

Starting on 14 April 1945, some Pe-2FT aircraft were operated by the 1st Czechoslovak Mixed Air Division made up of exiled Czechoslovakian pilots in the Soviet Union. After the war, the reinstated Czechoslovakian Air Force operated 32 Pe-2FT and 3 UPe-2 between May 1946 and mid 1951. The first aircraft arrived at Prague-Kbely airfield in April 1946 and formed two squadrons of the 25 Air Regiment in Havlíčkův Brod. Czechoslovakian aircraft were known under the designation B-32 (Pe-2FT) and CB-32 (UPe-2).

===Finnish Air Force===
In 1941, after the outbreak of the Continuation War, Finland purchased six captured Pe-2 aircraft from Germany. These arrived at State Aircraft Factory facilities at Härmälä, near Tampere, in January 1942, where the airframes were overhauled and given Finnish serial numbers. The seventh Pe-2 was bought from the Germans in January 1944, and it was flown to Finland at the end of the month.

It was initially planned to use these planes as dive bombers in the 1st flight of LeLv 48, which began to receive its aircraft in July 1942, but during the training it was found out that this caused too much strain for the engines. Thus, the role of Pe-2s was changed to fly long-range photographic and visual reconnaissance missions for the Army General Headquarters. These sorties began in late 1942, and were often flown with two 250 kg (551 lb) bombs for harassment bombing and in order to cover the true purpose of missions.

By the time the Soviet Fourth strategic offensive started in June 1944, the secondary bombing role had already ended and the surviving Pe-2s began to be used solely over the Karelian Isthmus on photographic reconnaissance flights in order to find out enemy troop concentrations, usually escorted by four Finnish Air Force Bf 109 Gs. These vital missions allowed artillery and bombers of the Finnish Air Force and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s Detachment Kuhlmey to strike against formations preparing for attack, which had an important impact on the outcome of the Battle of Tali-Ihantala, where the Soviet advance was halted.

During the Continuation War, three Pe-2s were lost in accidents or technical failures, one was destroyed in bombing of Lappeenranta airfield, one was shot down by Soviet fighters and one went missing in action. In the Lapland War the only remaining machine flew a single reconnaissance sortie in October 1944. On average, the aircraft flew some 94 hours per plane during the war.

The Finnish Air Force also operated one Petlyakov Pe-3 (PE-301) that had been captured in 1943.

PE-301 and PE-215 were destroyed when Soviet aircraft bombed the Lappeenranta airfield on 2 July 1944. PE-212 went down in 1943, PE-213 was destroyed in an emergency landing in 1942. PE-214 was destroyed in a failed take-off attempt at Härmälä on 21 May 1942. As Härmälä airfield was quite short, the pilot had to tried to lift off with too little speed, which caused the aircraft to stall and crash, killing the crew. PE-217 managed to shoot down a Soviet fighter in 1944. PE-216 was destroyed in a forced landing in 1944. PE-211 survived the war and was removed from FAF lists in 1946. It was still standing beside the Kauhava airfield in 1952, but further information on its fate is unknown.

<doc id="548205" wikidata="Q6757092" url="?curid=548205" title="Marcia Clark">
<text>Marcia Rachel Clark (&#x27;Kleks, formerlyHorowitz; born August 31, 1953) is an American prosecutor, author, television correspondent, and television producer. She is best known for having been the lead prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder case.

==Early life and education==
Clark was born Marcia Rachel Kleks in Alameda, California, the daughter of Rozlyn (née Masur) and Abraham Kleks. Her father was born and raised in Israel and worked as a chemist for the FDA. Because of her father&#x27;s job, the family moved many times, living in California, New York, Michigan, and Maryland.

Kleks graduated from Susan E. Wagner High School, a public school in the Manor Heights section of Staten Island, New York City. She studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 1976 with a degree in political science, and then earned a Juris Doctor degree at Southwestern University School of Law.

==Career==
===Attorney===
Clark was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1979. She worked in private practice and as a public defender for the city of Los Angeles before she became a prosecutor in 1981. She worked as a deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County, California and was mentored by prosecutor Harvey Giss.

Clark is well known as the lead prosecutor in the 1995 trial of O. J. Simpson for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. Prior to the Simpson trial, Clark&#x27;s highest-profile trial occurred in 1991 when she prosecuted Robert John Bardo for the murder of television star Rebecca Schaeffer. Clark said that the media attention that she received during the trial was &quot;the hell of the trial,&quot; calling herself &quot;famous in a way that was kind of terrifying.&quot; Clark was advised by a jury consultant to &quot;talk softer, dress softer, wear pastels&quot; in order to improve her image. She subsequently changed her hairstyle into a perm, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described her as resembling &quot;Sigourney Weaver, only more professional.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;the transformation was not entirely seamless.&quot;

===Commentator and author===
Clark resigned from the district attorney&#x27;s office after she lost the Simpson case. She and Teresa Carpenter wrote a book about the Simpson case, &quot;Without a Doubt&quot;, in a deal reported to be worth $4.2 million.

Since the Simpson trial, Clark has made numerous appearances on television, including as a special correspondent for &quot;Entertainment Tonight.&quot; She provided coverage of high-profile trials and reported from the red carpet at awards shows such as the Emmy Awards. She was a guest attorney on the short-lived television series &quot;Power of Attorney&quot; and was also featured on Headline News analyzing the Casey Anthony trial. In July 2013, Clark provided commentary for CNN during the Florida trial of George Zimmerman.

Clark wrote a pilot script for a television series called &quot;Borderland&quot;, centering on &quot;a very dark version of the DA&#x27;s office.&quot; The series was purchased by FX but was never produced. Clark has contributed true-crime articles to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;.

Clark has written several novels. Her &quot;Rachel Knight&quot; series centers on a prosecutor in the Los Angeles district attorney&#x27;s office, and includes &quot;Guilt By Association&quot; (2011), &quot;Guilt By Degrees&quot; (2012), &quot;Killer Ambition&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Competition&quot; (2014). &quot;Guilt by Association&quot; was adapted as a television pilot for TNT in 2014.

Clark&#x27;s &quot;Samantha Brinkman&quot; series features a female defense attorney. It includes &quot;Blood Defense&quot; (2016), &quot;Moral Defense&quot; (2016) and &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; (2017), and was planned as a television adaptation series for NBC that Clark would cowrite. Clark did not expect to become an author, saying, &quot;As a lawyer, I came to understand early that storytelling plays a very important part when you address a jury. So I guess my instincts have always kind of been there when it comes to weaving a narrative.&quot; She read &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; and &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; mystery fiction as a child and said &quot;I have been addicted to crime since I was born. I was making up crime stories when I was a 4 or 5-year-old kid.&quot;

==Media appearances==
In August 2013, Clark appeared as attorney Sidney Barnes in the &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; episode &quot;Now You See Me, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot;.

In 2015, Clark was parodied on the sitcom &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; in the form of the character Marcia, implied to be Marcia Clark in a relationship with Chris Darden, portrayed by Tina Fey. Fey was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for the role.

Clark appears in the 2016 documentary miniseries &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;. She is played by Sarah Paulson in the 2016 television series &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;, which focuses on the Simpson trial. Paulson&#x27;s performance as Clark earned wide acclaim, and she earned a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the role. Clark attended the Emmy Awards with Paulson on September 18, 2016. Katey Rich wrote in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that the series positions Clark as a &quot;feminist hero.&quot;

In 2019, Clark appeared in the 18th season finale of Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s reality series &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as a VIP guest diner for winner and Season 6 veteran Ariel Contreras-Fox.

In 2024, Clark appeared on the third episode of comedian John Mulaney’s live comedy special &quot;Everybody’s in LA.&quot; While the episode was themed to and titled “Helicopters,” much of the discussion focused around the 1994 O.J. Simpson trial due to the presence of Clark and reporter Zoey Tur, who famously captured helicopter footage of the slow-speed Bronco chase. Clark and Tur had never met before their appearance on the show.

==Personal life==
When Clark was 17 years old, she was raped on a trip to Eilat, Israel. She has said that it was an experience with which she did not deal until later in life and that it greatly influenced her decision to become a prosecutor.

In 1976, Clark married Gabriel Horowitz, an Israeli professional backgammon player whom she had met as a student at UCLA. They obtained a &quot;Mexican divorce&quot; in 1980 and had no children. Horowitz was briefly in the news after he sold topless photos of Clark to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; during the Simpson trial.

In 1980, Clark married her second husband, Gordon Clark, a computer programmer and systems administrator who was employed at the Church of Scientology. They were divorced in 1995 and had two sons. Gordon argued at a custody hearing during the Simpson trial that he should receive full custody of their children given the long hours that Marcia had spent working for the trial.

Clark no longer considers herself religious, although she was raised Jewish and her first wedding was a Conservative Jewish ceremony. She was a member of the Church of Scientology until 1980.

Clark resides in Calabasas, California.
