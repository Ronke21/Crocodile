<doc id="554386" wikidata="Q842427" url="?curid=554386" title="Law of superposition">
<text>The law of superposition is an axiom that forms one of the bases of the sciences of geology, archaeology, and other fields pertaining to geological stratigraphy. In its plainest form, it states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest strata will lie at the bottom of the sequence, while newer material stacks upon the surface to form new deposits over time. This is paramount to stratigraphic dating, which requires a set of assumptions, including that the law of superposition holds true and that an object cannot be older than the materials of which it is composed. To illustrate the practical applications of superposition in scientific inquiry, sedimentary rock that has not been deformed by more than 90° will exhibit the oldest layers on the bottom, thus enabling paleontologists and paleobotanists to identify the relative ages of any fossils found within the strata, with the remains of the most archaic lifeforms confined to the lowest. These findings can inform the community on the fossil record covering the relevant strata, to determine which species coexisted temporally and which species existed successively in perhaps an evolutionarily or phylogenetically relevant way.

==History==
The law of superposition was first proposed in 1669 by the Danish scientist Nicolas Steno, and is present as one of his major theses in the groundbreaking seminal work &quot;Dissertationis prodromus&quot; (1669). 

In the English-language literature, the law was popularized by William &quot;Strata&quot; Smith, who used it to produce the first geologic map of Britain. It is the first of Smith&#x27;s laws, which were formally published in &quot;Strata Identified by Fossils&quot; (1816–1819).

==Archaeological considerations==
Superposition in archaeology and especially in stratification use during excavation is slightly different as the processes involved in laying down archaeological strata are somewhat different from geological processes. Human-made intrusions and activity in the archaeological record need not form chronologically from top to bottom or be deformed from the horizontal as natural strata are by equivalent processes. Some archaeological strata (often termed as contexts or layers) are created by undercutting previous strata. An example would be that the silt back-fill of an underground drain would form some time after the ground immediately above it. Other examples of non vertical superposition would be modifications to standing structures such as the creation of new doors and windows in a wall. Superposition in archaeology requires a degree of interpretation to correctly identify chronological sequences and in this sense superposition in archaeology is more dynamic and multi-dimensional.

== Other limitations to stratification and superposition ==
Original stratification induced by natural processes can subsequently be disrupted or permutated by a number of factors, including animal interference and vegetation, as well as limestone crystallization. 

Stratification behaves in a different manner with surface-formed igneous depositions, such as lava flows and ash falls, and thus superposition may not always successfully apply under certain conditions.

<text>Davidson College is a private liberal arts college in Davidson, North Carolina, United States. It was established in 1837 by the Concord Presbytery and named after Revolutionary War general William Lee Davidson, who was killed at the nearby Battle of Cowan&#x27;s Ford.

Davidson is a four-year undergraduate institution and enrolls 1,973 students from 50 states and territories, Washington, D.C., and 46 countries. Of those students, 95 percent live on campus, 71 percent study abroad, and about 25 percent participate in 21 NCAA Division I sports. The college&#x27;s athletic teams, the Wildcats, compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference for all sports except football and wrestling, which compete in the Pioneer Football League and Southern Conference respectively. Davidson&#x27;s 665-acre (269 ha) main campus is located in a suburban community 19 miles (30 km) north of downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. The college also operates a 110-acre (44.5 ha) lake campus on the shores of nearby Lake Norman.

The college offers 37 majors and 39 minors in liberal arts disciplines as well as other interdisciplinary academic programs. Academic life at Davidson is governed by an honor code that allows students to take self-scheduled, unproctored final exams. Davidson has graduated 23 Rhodes Scholars and is among the top undergraduate institutions whose graduates receive Fulbright Scholarships.

==History==
An institution of higher learning of The Presbyterian Church (USA), Davidson College was founded in 1837 by The Concord Presbytery after purchasing of land from William Lee Davidson II, who claimed possession of at least 25 enslaved individuals in Mecklenburg County and 65 in Alabama. Davidson II owned the Beaver Dam plantation in Davidson, North Carolina where approximately 16-26 enslaved individuals lived and labored. William Lee Davidson II was the son of Revolutionary War commander Brigadier General William Lee Davidson, for whom the college is named. Church records show a meeting on May 13, 1835, among subsequent meetings, by members of the Concord Presbytery making plans to purchase and perform initial construction on the land, with land payments starting Jan 1 of the following year. The first students graduated from Davidson in 1840 and received diplomas with the newly created college seal designed by Peter Stuart Ney, who is believed by some to be Napoleon&#x27;s Marshal Ney.

In the 1850s, Davidson overcame financial difficulty by instituting &quot;The Scholarship Plan,&quot; a program that allowed Davidson hopefuls to purchase a scholarship for $100, which could be redeemed in exchange for full tuition to Davidson until the 1870s. The college&#x27;s financial situation improved dramatically in 1856 with a $250,000 donation by Maxwell Chambers, making Davidson the wealthiest college south of Princeton. The Chambers Building was erected to commemorate this gift. Maxwell Chambers was known to have owned a large number of enslaved people. On November 28, 1921, the Chambers Building was destroyed in a fire but was reconstructed eight years later with funding from the Rockefeller family. The Chambers Building continues to be the primary academic building on campus.

In 1923, the Gamma chapter in North Carolina of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Davidson. Over 1500 men and 500 women have been initiated into Davidson&#x27;s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. In 1924, James Duke formed the Duke Endowment, which has provided millions of dollars to the college. In 1954, the president of Georgia Tech Blake R. Van Leer and Davidson&#x27;s president John Rood Cunningham arranged the first-of-its-kind joint engineering program.

On May 5, 1972, the trustees voted to allow women to enroll at Davidson as degree students for the first time. Women had attended classes as early as the 1860s but did not enjoy degree privileges. The first women to attend classes at Davidson were the five daughters of its president, the Rev. John Lycan Kirkpatrick. The first women were permitted to attend classes to increase the size of the student body during the American Civil War. However, art major Marianna &quot;Missy&quot; Woodward became the first woman to graduate from Davidson. She graduated in 1973 and was the only woman in a class of 217.

In early 2005, the college&#x27;s board of trustees voted in a 31–5 decision to allow 20% of the board to be non-Christian. John Belk, the former mayor of Charlotte and one of the heirs of Belk Department Store, resigned in protest after more than six decades of affiliation with the college. Belk, however, continued his strong relationship with his alma mater and was honored in March 2006 at the Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the Belk Scholarship.

In 2007, Davidson eliminated the need for students to take out loans from the college to pay for their tuition. All demonstrated need is met through grants, student employment, parental contribution, and federal student loans. The college claims to be the first liberal arts college in the United States to do this.

==Academics==
===Admissions===
&quot;Princeton Review&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; regard Davidson&#x27;s admission process as &quot;most selective&quot;.

For the class of 2027 (enrolled fall 2023), Davidson received 7,363 applications and accepted 1,068 (14.5%). Of those, 1,005 applied early decision and 338 were accepted. The yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) was 49.3%. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolled students was 670–740 for Evidence-Based Reading &amp; Writing, and 690–750 for Math, while the ACT Composite range was 31–33. Enrolled freshmen represent 41 states and 35 countries; 35.9% were from the American South. The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.

===Rankings===
The 2025 annual ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rates Davidson College as tied for the 14th best among &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot; in America, tied for 4th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; and 10th for &quot;Best Value&quot;. Davidson College was ranked 48th overall on &quot;Forbes&quot; &#x27; list of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges,&quot; for the 2024-25 rankings. Davidson was also ranked as the 11th best liberal arts college, and 10th best in the South. In 2018, Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance rated Davidson College as the #1 best college for value across all colleges and universities in America.

According to The Princeton Review, Davidson is ranked among the top twenty colleges nationally for the following categories: &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience For Undergraduates,&quot; &quot;Professors Get High Marks&quot; (1st), &quot;Professors Make Themselves Accessible&quot; (16th), &quot;Students Study the Most&quot; (10th), &quot;School Runs Like Butter&quot; (4th), &quot;Town-Gown Relations are Great&quot; (3rd), &quot;Easiest Campus to Get Around&quot; (3rd), and &quot;Best Quality of Life (16th).&quot;

===Faculty===

Davidson has a student-faculty ratio of 8:1, 69% of its classes are under 20 students.

Davidson has 201 full-time faculty members. Almost all faculty members have terminal degrees in their field, with 97% of full-time members holding PhDs.

===Honor code===

Davidson students are bound by an honor code, signed by each student at the start of their first year.

The Davidson College Honor Code states: &quot;Every student shall be honor bound to refrain from cheating (including plagiarism). Every student shall be honor bound to refrain from stealing. Every student shall be honor bound to refrain from lying about College business. Every student shall be honor bound to report immediately all violations of the Honor Code of which the student has first-hand knowledge; failure to do so shall be a violation of the Honor Code. Every student found guilty of a violation shall ordinarily be dismissed from the College. Every member of the College community is expected to be familiar with the operation of the Honor Code.&quot;

As one of the most obvious manifestations of the Honor Code, Davidson students take self-scheduled, unproctored final exams. Some exams (known as &quot;reviews&quot; in Davidson vernacular) are take-home, timed, and closed book. Other take-home exams may be open book or untimed. Often take-home exams may take students days to complete. Every assignment submitted at Davidson includes either an implicit or (more often) explicit pledge that the student neither gave nor received assistance on the assignment beyond the bounds of the Honor Code. The Honor Code extends beyond &#x27;reviews,&#x27; essays, or research papers. Notes around campus are commonly seen, whether on a bulletin board or taped to a brick walkway, describing an item found at the location and the finder&#x27;s contact information so that the property may be recovered.

===Majors and minors===
Davidson offers majors in 31 subject areas. Students can also design their own major through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. In addition to the one major required for graduation, students may pursue a second major, a minor, or a concentration. Its three most popular majors, by 2024 graduates, were Econometrics &amp; Quantitative Economics (89), Biology (83), and Political Science (54).

==Student life==
===Athletics===

Davidson competes at the NCAA Division I level in 19 sports. Of these sports, 10 are men&#x27;s and 9 are women&#x27;s. Approximately 24% of the Davidson on-campus student body participates in varsity sports. Davidson has the fourth-smallest undergraduate enrollment of any school in Division I football, behind Presbyterian, VMI (Virginia Military Institute), and Wofford (smallest to largest).

Davidson&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Wildcats. Their colors are red and black, although since 2008, many sports including football, men&#x27;s basketball, and men&#x27;s soccer have moved towards a brighter hue of red and white. The Wildcats participate as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference in all sports other than football and wrestling. Sports that compete in other conferences include football in Division I Football Championship Subdivision Pioneer Football League, and wrestling in the Southern Conference.

===Student organizations===
The main student newspaper on campus is the &quot;Davidsonian&quot;, which is published weekly. The &quot;Davidsonian&quot; was founded in 1914 and has published a volume every year since then. Digital archives of the newspaper are available online. 

Davidson offers over 150 student organizations on campus, including arts &amp; culture organizations, performance groups, sports groups, political organizations, gender and sexuality groups, religious organizations, and social action groups. The Student Activities Office encourages and is available for students wishing to develop an organization not yet established at Davidson.

===Greek life and eating houses===
The fraternity and eating house system at Davidson is known as Patterson Court. There are several sororities and sororities at Davidson College. Approximately 80% of the female students and 40% of male students belong to a fraternity or an eating house.

===College Farm===
The Farm at Davidson College supplies local, organic produce to students through the college&#x27;s Dining Services operation. The farm covers three acres and is a stand-alone, business-based unit of the college.

==Royal Shakespeare Company residencies==
In 2002, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in residency at Davidson College, the RSC&#x27;s second residency at a US college or university. The performance inaugurated the Duke Family Performance Hall. In March 2005, the RSC returned to Davidson and was in residency for most of the month, performing &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; by William Shakespeare, as well as numerous educational activities, many of which were open to the general public. In February 2006, their artists directed scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and other theatrical materials inspired by Shakespeare, entitled &quot;For Every Passion, Something&quot;, with Davidson students as actors. The productions &quot;Infinite Variety&quot; and &quot;For Every Passion Something&quot; were presented at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland. In February 2007, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Pericles&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, as well as Roy Williams&#x27;s Days of Significance, in the Duke Family Performance Hall. In 2008, the RSC conducted educational programs, similar to those they presented in 2006. Also during this residency, playwright Rona Munro developed a new play, &quot;Little Eagles&quot;.

==Financial aid==
In 2007, Davidson College announced that all students would have their demonstrated financial need met by grants and student employment; loans would no longer be a component of any Davidson financial aid package. The Duke Endowment pledged $15,000,000 to support the initiative and it was named The Davidson Trust.

In addition to not including loans in their financial aid packages, Davidson&#x27;s 2014 capital campaign adding 156 new scholarships funded with $88 million. Davidson states that they are committed to providing 100% of demonstrated need of all students, which is calculated by the federal FAFSA program, with 44% of students receiving need-based aid and over 50% receiving some form of financial aid.

<text>Anand Panyarachun (, , ; born 9 August 1932) is a Thai retired politician who was Prime Minister twice: once in 1991–1992 and again during the latter half of 1992. He was effective in initiating economic and political reforms, one of which was the drafting of Thailand&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Constitution&quot;, which was promulgated in 1997 and abrogated in 2006. Anand received a Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service in 1997.

==Education career in civil service and business==
Anand was the youngest of twelve children of a wealthy family of Mon heritage on his father&#x27;s side and Thai-Chinese (Hokkien) on his mother&#x27;s. His father, Sern was a son of a high-ranking official of Mon ancestry. His father studied in England on a king&#x27;s scholarship, and later oversaw all royal schools and thereafter a successful businessman in the 1930s. His paternal grandfather built an ethnic Mon monastery in Ratchaburi called Wat Khao Chon Phran. According to Anand, he inherited his Chinese heritage from his maternal grandmother, whose surname was Lau (). His Chinese ancestors came to Thailand in the mid-18th century and eventually became one of the country&#x27;s most prominent Chinese families. He is distantly related to Korn Chatikavanij through this branch of his family. Anand attended Dulwich College and later read law at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with honours in 1955.

Anand spent 23 years in the foreign service, serving at times as the Ambassador of Thailand to the United Nations, Canada, the United States, and West Germany. In January 1976 he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the foreign ministry, and played a leading role in ensuring the US military withdrawal from Thailand. Following that year&#x27;s October coup, Anand was branded a communist by the military during the subsequent political witch hunts, presumably for the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s role in the normalisation of diplomatic relations between Thailand and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Although the civil service panel set up to investigate the allegations cleared him of any wrongdoing, Anand was put into relatively unimportant posts and in 1979 left the public sector for the private. He became the Vice-Chairman of the Saha-Union Group in 1979 and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1991. He has been a Director of Siam Commercial Bank since 1984.

==First administration==
On 23 February 1991, a military coup led by General Sunthorn Kongsompong, supreme commander of the armed forces, and General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the commander-in-chief of the army, imprisoned Chatichai Choonhavan, the democratically elected leader. As in previous Thai coups, the military formed a National Peace Keeping Council (NPKC) to run the country. To shore up its image and gain the trust of King Bhumibol, the NPKC appointed Anand as interim prime minister.

Anand, closely linked to the palace and held in respect by both the bureaucracy and the business community, proved acceptable to the people and the international community. He was regarded as being astute and disciplined, and had never been associated with any financial scandals.

Upon accepting the position of prime minister, Anand was quick to declare that he did not agree with everything the junta had done and that he intended to follow an independent course. He angered the NPKC by suggesting that Chatichai be released immediately upon a cabinet being appointed.

===Formation===
The interim constitution that was promulgated on 1 March 1991 reconfirmed the intention of the NKPC to retain substantial control. However, Anand was allowed relative freedom to select his own cabinet members. For the entire period of his premiership Anand faced constant pressure from the junta leaders, who tried to influence government decisions in order to gain financial benefits.

Anand filled his cabinet with well-known academics, technocrats, and ex-bureaucrats with proven records. Various commentators, ranging from the president of the Thailand Development Research Institute to the mass-circulation newspaper &quot;Thai Rath&quot;, described the cabinet as the most impressive Thailand had ever had. The strong guiding hand of privy councillor Prem Tinsulanonda could be seen. Amongst those selected by Anand were Prem&#x27;s previous finance minister and economic advisor. A senior diplomat during the years Prem served as prime minister became foreign minister. The technocratic orientation of the cabinet substantially diminished the fears of foreign investors.

===Reforms===
Anand&#x27;s administration proved harder-working than his predecessors. The administration worked on its task of implementing a long list of much-needed reforms. Its emphasis on education, public health, exports, agriculture, industry, environment, and improvement in living conditions, met with widespread approval. In a Bangkok poll in late-July 1991, 61 percent of respondents felt that the Anand government was more honest than previous administrations.

Arguably the most significant of the reforms was a restructuring of the taxation system, which saw the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) and a reduction in corporate and income taxation. Several measures were taken to free up the flow of funds into and out of the country. Thai nationals were allowed to invest abroad without the approval of the Bank of Thailand. Regulations were altered for foreign banks to open branches and the ceiling on bank interest rates was lifted. In addition, the process for obtaining official operating licences for factories was greatly simplified, while the method of allocating textile and tapioca quotas was made more apparent. In the energy sector, price control barriers were dismantled.

The government was also able to successfully conclude agreements for a number of large-scale infrastructure projects initiated by the Chatichai administration. A regulatory board to oversee the privatisation and private investment in infrastructure projects was established. The projects themselves were also to be independently approved and monitored by agencies outside the government in order to minimise the opportunities for corruption.

In an attempt to spread the benefits of the country&#x27;s economic growth, civil servants were given a 23 percent raise in wages, state employers a 20 percent wage rise, and the minimum wage was raised by 15 percent. In addition to this, the Anand government allocated six billion baht in the fiscal year 1992 budget to be distributed to villages and spent at their discretion.

Key accomplishments of Anand&#x27;s government include:
* The establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
* A highly effective anti-AIDS/HIV policy.
* Electricity market reform, including the introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the initiation of a 10-year liberalisation and privatisation plan for EGAT. Many have noted that Saha-Union Group, which Anand chaired, won a major bid to build a large coal-fired power plant while Anand was in power.
* Award of a multi-billion baht concession to Telecom Asia (today known as True) to build and operate two million telephone lines in Bangkok. It was noted by many that General Suchinda, the coup leader who installed Anand as Prime Minister, was appointed chairman of Telecom Asia after he was toppled from power.
* Suspension of the Hopewell rail-train airport link project.

===Foreign policy===
On the international front Anand performed well. Despite international concern over the coup, foreign administrations had sufficient confidence to resume relations quickly. Anand made visits to China in September 1991 and Japan in December 1991, and went on to meetings with President George H. W. Bush in the United States. He was able to shake off the stigma of being a junta-installed prime minister, instead successfully presenting the image of an administration determined to deregulate, cut red tape, and create an environment conductive to free enterprise.

The Anand government&#x27;s policies to its neighbours followed the lead of his predecessor Chatichai. Relationships with Laos improved significantly, with Thailand allocating one-half of its 200 million baht aid budget to the nation. Thailand under Anand became deeply involved in the Cambodian peace process, while relations with Vietnam went through a period of fence-mending and confidence-building.

The only foreign relations area where there were serious reasons for criticising Anand&#x27;s administration was Thailand&#x27;s soft stance towards the repressive military junta of Burma.

===Disagreements with the NPKC===
Anand disagreed with the military junta&#x27;s plans to increase the defence budget. Anand denied the military&#x27;s request for supplemental funding that would have totalled 53 billion baht. Junta member Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil criticised the government for being too &quot;inefficient&quot; and calling for it to resign. Suchinda justified the military&#x27;s request by stating that there were still communist fighters in the Indochina region. In November and December Anand publicly repeated his views that the country&#x27;s security did not lie in military might, but in its economic and political development, on one occasion stating, &quot;Military might is no longer a guarantee of national security. No nation can feel secure as long as its citizens are deprived of freedom of political expression and of the opportunities for a better and more meaningful life.&quot;

Anand also voiced disagreement with the junta&#x27;s draft constitution, although the constitution was ultimately promulgated. At first, he refused to comment as the Constitution Scrutinising Committee, hand-picked by Sunthorn, made changes to what became the final draft constitution. Then on 16 November, Anand spoke out against clauses that gave the appointed 360 member Senate the same powers as elected members of the House of Representatives as well as a clause allowing permanent public officials and military officers to hold political posts. Anand suggested that the Senate be reduced in size. The military-dominated Constitution Drafting Assembly refused to accept his suggestions and voted unanimously to pass the draft. Anand&#x27;s response was simple: &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed&quot;.

===Human rights===
Anand&#x27;s refusal to interfere with the junta&#x27;s actions meant that his administration failed to come to grips with human rights issues. He had a comprehensive environmental bill passed, but it was ignored by the military, which continued its corrupt activities. Not long after it had taken power, the NPKC announced a huge rural development project that would help solve the problems of rural landlessness and encroachment on protected forests, issues that had for decades occupied the king&#x27;s attention. The military had promised to resettle more than 1.2 million people to permanent farmlands, but instead evicted villagers from forest reserves, where they had lived in some cases for generations, and transferred the lands to corporate plantations. In almost all cases, the army failed to provide new homes and food supplies. When an activist monk led villagers to protest, he and his followers were attacked and arrested.

In mid-June 1991, the outspoken president of the Labour Congress of Thailand, Thanong Phoarn, mysteriously disappeared. The deputy defence minister, a military man, casually brushed the matter aside, claiming that Thanong had probably fled his wife. He has not been seen since.

With respect to the freedom of information, the Anand administration also disappointed many. With the NPKC in full control of the media, any criticism of the military was censored. News of rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues of public concern were kept from the public. The transparency of the denials of censorship by the military-dominated Interior Ministry must have been apparent to Anand, but he chose to do nothing about them.

Anand was succeeded by General Suchinda, who was appointed by parliament after general elections.

==Second government==
Suchinda resigned on 24 May 1992, following an intervention by the king that ended the violent military crackdown on massive popular protests against his government. The five coalition parties that made up his administration still attempted to cling to power, however, despite calls for their resignation by the opposition and the press, and nominated Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, leader of the Chart Thai Party, for the premiership. At the time it looked as if House Speaker Arthit Urairat was set to submit Somboon&#x27;s name to the king. Arthit however held back the nomination of Somboon following a meeting with privy councillor Prem, who was thought to have been exerting pressure on behalf of the king. The House Speaker instead announced that no decision would be made until the constitutional amendments were passed on 10 June 1992, adding that the next prime minister would be a civilian.

On 10 June 1992, Arthit surprised the country by recommending Anand&#x27;s name instead of Somboon&#x27;s to the king. The announcement was greeted with almost universal approval and even relief. Only the coalition parties of the previous government were dismayed, turning at first on Arthit, who they saw as having betrayed them.

Four days later Anand announced the formation of his cabinet, which included twenty respected technocrats who had held ministerial portfolios during his previous tenure as prime minister. The top tasks of Anand&#x27;s government were the rehabilitation of the economy, the organisation of free and fair elections, and the removal of top armed forces commanders from their posts.

The Internal Peacekeeping Law, which allowed for the use of military force against demonstrators, was abolished on 29 June, and on 1 August, he removed Air Chief Marshal Kaset, General Issarapong, and General Chainarong, the First Regional Army Commander, from their posts.

Anand was succeeded by democratically elected Chuan Leekpai later in 1992.

==Post-political career==
Anand rejoined the Saha-Union Group as chairman after the general elections of 1992. His government had awarded Saha-Union a major Independent Power Producer concession. He resigned from Saha-Union Group in 2002.

===Constitution Drafting Assembly===
In 1996, Anand was elected as a member of the Constitution Drafting Assembly and was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He oversaw the drafting of what became known as the &quot;Peoples&#x27; Constitution&quot; of 1997. The constitution was abrogated in 2006 after a military coup against Thaksin Shinawatra that Anand supported. The People&#x27;s Constitution instituted several important reforms, including:

* Decentralisation of government, including the establishment of elected Tambon Administrative Organisations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organisations (PAOs). School administrations were also decentralised, although opposition from teachers delayed implementation of this reform
* Establishment of several independent government agencies, including the Election Commission, the Office of the Auditor-General, and the National Human Rights Commission
* Stipulated that candidates for parliament must hold at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree
* Mechanisms to increase political stability by favouring large parties over small ones, and hence singular governments over coalition governments

===National Reconciliation Commission===
From March 2005, Anand served as chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC), tasked with overseeing that peace was restored to the troubled south. A fierce critic of the Thaksin government, Anand frequently criticised his handling of the southern unrest, and in particular the State of Emergency Decree. He has been quoted to have said, &quot;The authorities have worked inefficiently. They have arrested innocent people instead of the real culprits, leading to mistrust among locals. So, giving them broader power may lead to increased violence and eventually a real crisis.&quot; Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated from 2005 to 2006, with escalating violence, especially among teachers and civilians. Despite much criticism of the Thaksin-government&#x27;s policies, Anand refused to submit the NRC&#x27;s final report, choosing instead to wait for the results of the 2006 legislative election.

Anand finally submitted the NRC&#x27;s recommendations on 5 June 2006. Among them were
* Introducing Islamic law
* Making ethnic Pattani-Malay (Yawi) an official language of the region
* Establishing an unarmed peacekeeping force
* Establishing a Peaceful Strategic Administrative Centre for southern border provinces

The recommendations were rejected by Privy Council President Prem, who stated, &quot;We cannot accept that [proposal] as we are Thai. The country is Thai and the language is Thai... We have to be proud to be Thai and have the Thai language as the sole national language&quot;.

===Other positions===
Anand is a member of the Trilateral Commission and the International Advisory Board of American International Group (AIG). Anand is a member of the Carlyle Group and sits on the Carlyle Group&#x27;s advisory board for Asia-Pacific.

Anand served as UNICEF Ambassador for Thailand since 1996. During November 2003 and December 2004, Anand was requested by then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to chair the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change of the United Nations. The panel of former presidents, prime ministers, and scholars was tasked to prepare recommendations for possible UN reform.

==Support for the 2006 military coup==
Anand supported the 2006 military coup that abrogated the People&#x27;s Constitution and overthrew the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. Anand had been a sharp critic of Thaksin for several years prior to the coup, and he blamed the coup on Thaksin. He also stated fears that the military junta would fail and that Thaksin could make a comeback. Anand claimed that the coup was well received by the people and that the military junta&#x27;s ban against opposition or political activity would not last long. He also noted surprise at the international community&#x27;s condemnation to the coup.

==Criticism of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn==
In a private meeting with US Ambassador Ralph Boyce, whose post-meeting report was leaked by WikiLeaks, Anand was critical of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Anand stated that the kingdom would be better off if the Crown Prince did not succeed his father; however, he noted that King Bhumibol was unlikely to change the succession. Anand also said that the Prince&#x27;s succession would face &quot;complicating factors&quot; if he continued interfering in politics and making &quot;embarrassing financial transactions&quot;. According to Anand, most Thai citizens believed that the Prince would not be able to change his behaviour. 

Anand neither confirmed nor denied that he made the statements. Anand&#x27;s alleged negative opinion of the Crown Prince was repeated by Privy Counsellor Prem Tinsulanonda and Siddhi Savetsila in their meetings with the US Ambassador, the reports of which were all leaked by Wikileaks. Criticism of the royal family is illegal in Thailand.

<text>The Cavalese cable car crash, also known as the Cermis massacre (), occurred on 3 February 1998, near the Italian town of Cavalese, a ski resort in the Dolomites some northeast of Trento. Twenty people were killed when a United States Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft, flying too low and against regulations, cut a cable supporting a cable car of an aerial lift.

The pilot, Captain Richard J. Ashby, and his navigator, Captain Joseph Schweitzer, were put on trial in the United States and found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. Later they were found guilty of obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman for having destroyed a videotape recorded from the plane, and were dismissed from the Marine Corps. The disaster, and the subsequent acquittal of the pilots, strained relations between the U.S. and Italy.

==Details of the disaster==

On 3 February 1998, an EA-6B Prowler, BuNo (bureau number) &quot;163045&quot;, &#x27;CY-02&#x27;, callsign &quot;Easy 01&quot;, an electronic warfare aircraft belonging to Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 2 (VMAQ-2) of the United States Marine Corps, was on a low-altitude training mission. At 15:13 local time it struck the cables supporting the aerial lift from Cavalese. The aircraft was flying at a speed of and at an altitude of between in a narrow valley between mountains.

When reaching approximately , the aircraft&#x27;s right wing struck the cables from underneath. The cable was severed, causing the cabin from Cermis with twenty people on board to plunge over , leaving no survivors. The plane had wing and tail damage, but was able to return to Aviano Air Base.

=== Victims ===

Among the twenty killed, nineteen passengers and one operator, were seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two Poles, two Austrians, and one Dutch.

==Reactions==
U.S. President Bill Clinton offered an official apology and promised monetary compensation. Thomas M. Foglietta, U.S. Ambassador to Italy at the time, visited the crash site and knelt in prayer, offering apologies on behalf of the United States.

In Italy, where the event received the name of &quot;strage del Cermis&quot;, the low-level flight was strongly criticized and some politicians called for a re-evaluation of rules or a complete ban of such exercises, though low-level flight was already illegal.

==First trial==
Italian prosecutors wanted the four marines to stand trial in Italy, but an Italian court recognized that North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) treaties gave jurisdiction to U.S. military courts.

Initially, all four men on the plane were charged, but only the pilot, Captain Richard J. Ashby, and his navigator, Captain Joseph Schweitzer, actually faced trial, charged with twenty counts of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. Ashby&#x27;s trial took place at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. It was determined that the maps on board did not show the cables and that the EA-6B was flying somewhat faster and considerably lower than allowed by military regulations. The restrictions in effect at the time required a minimum flying height of ; Ashby said he thought they were at . The cable was cut at a height of . Ashby further claimed that the altitude-measuring equipment, the altimeter, on his plane had been malfunctioning, and that he had been unaware of the speed restrictions. In March 1999, the jury acquitted Ashby, outraging the Italian public. The manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were then dropped.

==Second trial and re-examination==
Ashby and Schweitzer were court-martialed a second time for obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, because they had destroyed a videotape recorded on the plane the day of the disaster. The existence and destruction of this videotape only came to the attention of military investigators in August 1998; the other two members of the crew, Captains Chandler P. Seagraves and William L. Raney, received testimonial immunity and elected to disclose &quot;the truth about everything&quot;.

Ashby and Schweitzer were found guilty in May 1999; both were dismissed from the service and Ashby received a six-month prison term. He was released after four and a half months for good behavior. Schweitzer made a plea agreement that came to full light after the military jury deliberated upon sentencing. His agreement prevented him from serving any prison time, but it did not prevent him from receiving a dismissal.

In their appeal, Ashby and Schweitzer asked for a re-examination of their trial and for clemency, challenging their dismissals in order to be eligible for military benefits. They claimed that during the first trial the prosecution and the defense secretly agreed to drop the involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide charges, but to keep the obstruction of justice charge, in order to satisfy the requests coming from Italy. The appeal of Schweitzer was denied in November 2007. Decisions from the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces were made available in August 2009.

==U.S. official report==
In a formal investigation report redacted on 10 March 1998, and signed by Lieutenant General Peter Pace, the U.S. Marine Corps agreed with the results of the Italian officers. The investigation was led by General Michael DeLong, along with Italian Colonels Orfeo Durigon and Fermo Missarino. The document was kept secret until the Italian newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot; legally obtained a copy from the U.S. archives and published it on 13 July 2011.

The Marine aircrew was determined to be flying too low and too fast, putting themselves and others at risk. The investigation team suggested that disciplinary measures against the flight crew and commanding officers should be taken, that the U.S. had to bear the full blame for what happened, and that victims&#x27; relatives were entitled to receive a monetary settlement.

The commission found that the squadron was deployed at Aviano on 27 August 1997, before the publication of new directives by the Italian government forbidding flight below in Trentino-Alto Adige. All the squadron&#x27;s pilots received a copy of the directive. A copy of the directive was later found, unopened, in the cockpit of the EA-6B along with maps marking the cable car wire route. Directives were irrelevant here, since diving below cables was prohibited at all times regardless. In the report, the pilots are said to be usually well-behaved and sane, without any previous case of drug abuse or psychological stress. Nevertheless, on 24 January, they had received a formal warning for flying too low after a training take-off.

On 2 February, Schweitzer planned the flight route for a low-altitude training mission using obsolete documents. It was proved that the squadron commander, Lieutenant Colonel Muegge, and his assistants, Captains Roys, Recce, Watton, and Caramanian, did not alert the navigator about the new flight altitude limitations, possibly because the proposed flight had a lower floor of , enough to be safe with any cable in the area. The report included an interview with the commander of 31st Fighter Wing, who stated that Muegge confessed to him that he and his crew, save for Ashby, were aware of the current flight limitations. After approving the report, Pace suggested disciplinary measures be taken against the commanders as well.

On the morning of the disaster, the plane underwent maintenance due to a fault in the &quot;G-meter&quot;, which measures g-forces; the unit was replaced. The radar altimeter was checked and reported to be in normal condition. After the disaster, Ashby reported the altimeter never sounded a low altitude warning, but this is disputed and highly the time of the disaster, the altimeter was set to alert at and the plane had been flying at less than .

Ashby was qualified for low-altitude flights and prohibited from diving below cables at all times. His last training mission of that kind was flown over six months before, on 3 July. The report includes flight tracing from a nearby AWACS airplane. The document reports a camcorder aboard the flight, but it was blank after Schweitzer had taken the original cassette and burned it afterwards. Schweitzer confessed in 2012 that he had burned the tape containing incriminating evidence upon returning to Aviano Air Base.

==Compensation==
By February 1999, the victims&#x27; families had received per victim as immediate help by the Italian government.
In May 1999, the U.S. Congress rejected a bill that would have set up a $40 million compensation fund for the victims.
In December 1999, the Italian Parliament approved a monetary compensation plan for the families ($1.9 million per victim). NATO treaties obligated the U.S. government to pay 75% of this compensation, which it did.

<text>A cram school (colloquially: crammer, test prep, tuition center, or exam factory) is a specialized school that trains its students to achieve particular goals, most commonly to pass the entrance examinations of high schools or universities. The English name is derived from the slang term &quot;cramming&quot;, meaning to study a large amount of material in a short period of time. The word &quot;crammer&quot; may be used to refer to the school or to an individual teacher who assists a student in cramming.

==Education==
Cram schools may specialize in a particular subject or subjects, or may be aligned with particular schools. Special cram schools that prepare students to re-take failed entrance examinations are also common. As the name suggests, the aim of a cram school is generally to impart as much information to its students as possible in the shortest period of time. The goal is to enable the students to obtain a required grade in particular examinations, or to satisfy other entrance requirements such as language skill (e.g.: IELTS). Cram schools are sometimes criticized, along with the countries in which they are prevalent, for a focus on rote learning and a lack of training in critical thinking and analysis.

==By region==

=== Australia ===
Cram schools are referred to largely as &quot;coaching colleges&quot;, they are used primarily to achieve the necessary results for the entrance exam for selective schools in New South Wales. They are also used extensively in English, mathematics and science courses for the Higher School Certificate, Victorian Certificate of Education, and other high school leavers exams.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, cram schools are known as &quot;coaching centers&quot; and in some cases, &quot;tutorials&quot;. Most cram schools provide help for admission tests of public universities and medical colleges like BUET, CUET, RUET, KUET, Universities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Jahangirnagar, medical colleges etc., and public examinations like PSC, JSC, SSC, and HSC. There are also some variants which have entered the market of ever-increasing help seekers. For example, cram schools now also prepare students for language tests like IELTS and TOEFL, aptitude tests like GRE, GMAT, SAT, and so on. In recent years, cram schools have also been extended to the tests for government civil services like BCS Examination.

=== Brazil ===

Cram schools are called &quot;Cursinhos&quot; (lit. &quot;Little Courses&quot;) in Brazil and are attended by students who will be taking a vestibular exam to be admitted into a university.

===Chile===
Cram schools are called &quot;Preuniversitarios&quot; in Chile, and are attended by students before taking PTU (University Transition Test) in order to get onto undergraduate studies.

===China===

Buxiban () are cram schools located in China. They are related to the phenomenon of buke, which is extra study for the improvement of students’ academic performance in National Higher Education Entrance Examination (commonly known as &quot;Gaokao&quot;). They exist due to the importance of standardized exams, such as:
* High school entrance exam (after junior high, at 9th year of school).
* The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or &quot;Gaokao&quot;, mandatory for college admission.
* English language exams. Passing the College English Test (CET) band 4 and 6 is sometimes a prerequisite for bachelor&#x27;s degree, and the certificates are often important to finding employment. The TOEFL and GRE tests from ETS are required for studying abroad in English-speaking countries.
* Entrance exams to domestic graduate program. Over recent years the competition has intensified, partially because many new college graduates fail to find satisfactory jobs and seek post-graduate education instead.

China has a test-driven system. Education departments give entrance examinations to sort students into schools of different levels. Examinations like the National Higher Education Entrance Examination (&quot;Gaokao&quot;) are vital, deciding the academic future of the participants. This education system cultivated the cramming style of teaching. Schools and teachers usually regard grades to be the primary goal. This sometimes leads to teachers imparting exam skills instead of knowledge and inspiration. But as the population of students decreases each year and admission to domestic universities expands, the pressure of the Entrance Exam has been reducing.

===France===

The national exam (baccalauréat) ending high-school is easy to obtain (the success rate is about 90%), and the grades obtained matter relatively little (most higher education school choose their students before the baccalauréat results, based on grades during high school). Thus, baccalauréat cram schools are rare. Individual tutoring is more common.

After the baccalauréat, about 5% of the French students attend the selective &quot;Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles&quot; (prep school) or CPGE. These two-year programs are meant to prepare undergrad students to the entrance exams of high-profile graduate schools (Grandes écoles) in science, engineering and business — including École Normale Supérieure, HEC Paris, EDHEC, ESCP, EM Lyon, ESSEC, École polytechnique, Arts et Métiers ParisTech, Télécom Paris, École des Ponts, CentraleSupélec, École des Mines, and ISAE-SUPAERO. A large proportion of CPGE are public schools, with very small tuition fees. There are about 400 CPGE schools for 869 classes, including about 58 private schools. They have produced most of France&#x27;s scientists, intellectuals, and executives during the last two centuries.

French prep schools are characterized by heavy workload and very high demands, varying however between schools. Programs are heavier than the first two years in public universities, covering several majors (for example Maths and Physics). Students in CPGE have between 36 and 40 hours of class a week, as well as one or more weekly 2-to-4 hours written test on each major (often also on Saturday). Students are expected to work on their own at least 2 hours a day, while the most ambitious students can work more than 5 hours every evening after classes, as well as during the weekend and holidays. Moreover, students have to take what is called &quot;colles&quot; (or &quot;khôlles&quot;) mainly 2 times a week, which are oral interrogations. For science topics, it consists of an hour-long session where a group of typically 3 students, each on a board, and dealing with a question related to a specific lesson (e.g. a demonstration of a theorem) and/or exercises. The teacher listens to, assists and corrects the students, then grades them. Khôlles on languages (e.g. English) consists in a 30 minutes test: first listening to an audio or studying a newspaper article and summarizing it, and then writing a short essay on the theme. Everything is then presented orally to the teacher. Literacy khôlles often consist in preparing and presenting an essay.

Entrance competitive exams to the &quot;Grandes Ecoles&quot; consist in written and oral exams. For scientific branches, a project involving research-oriented works has to be prepared. Written exams are typically 4h-long sets of exercises and problems built around a specific topic (which often can&#x27;t be fully treated in the given amount of time), and require both reasoning and raw knowledge. Oral exams are often similar to khôlles.

This is a two-year track. In most schools, only the second year is explicitly focused on entrance exams preparation. If a student could not obtain the school(s) they wanted, they can repeat the second year.

There are three main branches : 
* Scientific branch study mainly math, physics and chemistry, IT, industrial sciences, biology and earth sciences. Sub-branches are : math-physics, physics-chemistry, physics-industrial sciences, and biology-earth sciences. Many French research scientists went through scientific CPGE.
* Economics/business branch (often called &quot;Prépa HEC&quot;) study mainly social sciences, economy, math and languages. Many important French public figures and politicians went through this way. Sub-branches specialize in math/economics, economics/social sciences, or management.
* Humanities branch (called Khâgne) study mainly philosophy, literature, foreign and ancient languages, history. Sub-branches specialize in social sciences or literature.

The tracks and schools are known for their folklore (slang terms, songs and hymns, anecdotes), and often inherited from early 19th-century generations of students.

===Greece===

Φροντιστήρια (from φροντίζω, to take care of) have been a permanent fixture of the Greek educational system for several decades. They are considered the norm for learning foreign languages (English language learning usually starts during the elementary school years) and for having a chance to pass the university entrance examinations. The preparation for the country-wide university entrance examinations practically takes up the two last years of upper high school, and the general view is that the amount of relevant school hours is insufficient for the hard competition, regardless of the teachers&#x27; abilities. This leads to students taking state school lessons from 08.15 to 14.00 at school, going home for lunch, continue for two or three hours in the cramming school and returning to prepare the homework both for state school and &quot;frontistirio&quot;. In the weekend, the students usually have lessons in the cramming school on Saturday morning and on Sunday morning revision tests. Unhired teachers by the state find a way to employment through these private businesses.

These two popular views pave the ground for the abundant number of cram schools, also attended by numerous high school students for general support of their performance.

===Hong Kong===
Cram schools in Hong Kong are called tutorial schools. These cram schools put focus on the major public examinations in Hong Kong, namely HKDSE, and teach students on techniques on answering questions in the examinations. They also provide students tips on which topics may appear on the coming examination (called &quot;question tipping&quot;), and provide students some sample questions that are similar to those that appear in the examinations. Some cram school teachers in Hong Kong have become idolized and attract many students to take their lessons. These teachers are called &quot;King of tutors (補習天王)&quot;. English and math are the most common subjects taught in Hong Kong cram schools.

Cram schools in Hong Kong are famous because of the stresses from Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). These cram school teaching includes practicing exam questions and grammar drills. Moreover, they provide model essays for English language exam. However, some schools are not licensed, and few educators have teaching qualifications. Their education is fun and appealing to the students but may be of little use in actually passing exams.

===India===

Numerous cram schools—referred to as coaching centers/institutes, tutorials/tuitions, dummy schools or classes in India—have sprung up all over the nation. These tutorials have become a parallel education system and it is very common and almost mandatory for the students to go to cram schools. They aim to tutor students to pass schools and college exams and getting their clients through various competitive exams to enter prestigious institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology for engineering courses the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences for medical courses at the undergraduate , postgraduate levels and the National Law Universities for legal and judicial courses and UPSC to become successful IAS and IPS officers.

Many such schools prepare students to crack prestigious national entrance/scholarship exams at the high school level such as JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) Main &amp; Advanced to enter prestigious engineering colleges like the IITs, NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test – Undergraduate level) for entrance into major medical science undergraduate programs and Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) for entering into premier law schools of the country.

Initiatives like the National Level Common Entrance Examination (NLCEE) complement these efforts by organizing scholarship exams and exposure programs, which provide students with career guidance and visits to premier institutions like IITs. Such initiatives aim to help students make informed decisions, reducing the stress and uncertainty often associated with competitive exams.

Various such exams are held for entering fields such as scientific research, engineering, medicine, management, accountancy, law and also into India&#x27;s premier central and state government services organized by UPSC, SSC etc.

===Indonesia===
Cram schools in Indonesia are called bimbingan belajar (learning assistance), often shortened into bimbel, and accepts students preparing for National Examinations before passing elementary school, junior high school, high school and college entrance exams. These cram schools teach students with exam simulations and problem-solving tutorials. Usually, these cram schools teach students by past exam questions. Bimbels in Indonesia offer lessons after school hours, weekends or public holidays.

===Ireland===
&quot;Grind schools&quot;, as they are known in the Republic of Ireland, prepare students for the Leaving Certificate examination. Competition for university places (the &quot;points race&quot;) has intensified with recent years: students wishing to study medicine, law or veterinary science in particular aim to achieve high points (up to 625) to be accepted. Some grind schools, such as The Institute of Education, Ashfield College, Leinster Senior College, The Dublin Academy of Education and Bruce College, teach full-time. Many others offer weekend or evening classes for students in subjects in which they struggle.

===Japan===

It is a large industry in Japan and caters to all types of school tests preparations, from kindergarten to high school graduation; it began growing rapidly in the 1970s. At that time, the number of universities was small, but college competition was intensive because almost 95% of students graduated from high school. In addition, Japan had the highest achievement test scores in the world from the 1980s to 2000, causing the cram school industry to grow. The cram schools, called juku, are privately owned, and offer lessons conducted after regular school hours, on weekends, and during summer and winter breaks.

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, it is considered a norm for parents, especially those from the middle and upper class, to send schoolchildren for private tuition. Such services are often provided by tuition centers and/or private tutors. These tutors may be full-time tutors, schoolteachers, retirees, or even senior students. Many concerned parents choose to send their children to different tuition classes or schedules based on the child&#x27;s entrance examination subjects. Some students may go to tuition for their weaker subjects, while many schoolchildren are increasingly known to attend at least 10 hours of private tuition every week. Correspondingly, the reputation and business of a tuition center often depends on venue, schedule, number of top-scoring clients, and advertizing by word of mouth. It is not uncommon for private tutors to offer exclusive pre-examination seminars, to the extent where some tutors entice schoolchildren to attend such seminars with the promise of examination tips, or even supposedly leaked examination questions.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, it has become very common for parents to send their children to such institutions, popularly known as &quot;academies&quot;, after school for further private coaching. It has become prevalent in almost all levels of education, from junior classes to colleges and, to a lesser extent, universities. Due to the near-universality of this system, it has become very difficult to compete successfully in almost any level of exams without them, despite the added burden on the students.

===Peru===
In Peru, cram schools, known as &quot;Academias&quot;, are institutions which intensively prepare, in about a year, high school graduates to gain admission to either University (&quot;Academia Pre Universitaria&quot;), or Military Schools (&quot;Academia Pre-Militar&quot;).
Cram Schools in Peru are not an admission requirement to enter any tertiary institution; however, due to fierce competition, preparation in a cram school allows the candidate to achieve the highest grade possible in the entry exam and so gain entry to their desired Tertiary Institution.
Cram Schools are independent of universities, however, of recent a post-high-school, pre-university school has started at some public and private universities in Peru. Under the name of CEntro PREuniversitario (name or acronym of university, for instance CEPREUNI or CEPREPUCP, after Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria or Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, commonly referred to as &quot;the CEPRE&quot; or &quot;the PRE&quot;). Some of these CEPREs offer automatic admission to their university to their students who reach a set level of achievement

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, cram schools are usually called &quot;review centers&quot; or &quot;review schools&quot;. They are often attended by students in order to study for and pass college and university entrance examinations, or to pass licensure examinations such as the Philippine Bar Examination, the Philippine Physician Licensure Examination, or the Philippine Nurse Licensure Examination.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, it is very common for students in the local education system to be enrolled in cram schools, better known locally as tuition centers. Enrollment in these after-school tuition centers is extremely high, especially for students bound for national exams, such as the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), GCE O Levels, or the GCE A Levels. Students attending tuition centers on a daily basis is not unheard of in Singapore.

===South Korea===

Although the South Korean educational system has been criticized internationally for its stress and competitiveness, it remains common for South Korean students to attend one or more cram schools (&quot;hagwons&quot;) after their school-day is finished, most students studying there until 10 P.M. Some types of cram schools include math, science, art, and English. English language institutes along with math are particularly popular. Certain places, such as Gangnam in Seoul, are well known for having a lot of hagwons. Because of hagwons, many Koreans have voiced complaints about how public education is falling behind in terms of quality compared to private education, creating a gap between students who can afford the expensive hagwon tuition fee and those who cannot. Today, it is almost mandatory for Korean students to attend one or more hagwons in order to achieve high results on a test.

South Korean students have two big tests per semester: midterms and finals. They just have written tests in those subjects. A distinct feature of the cramming teaching method in Korea is extra preparation for these tests, ranging from tests from previous years and other schools to various prep books made by different education companies. These test preparation periods normally start a month before the test date. After school, generally, most students go to hagwons to supplement what they learned from the teachers who provide knowledge to the students. Students memorize for tests, and go to hagwons for high grades.

The Korean College Scholastic Ability Test, the standardized college entrance examination commonly referred to as the &quot;suneung&quot;, also plays a large part in why so many students attend hagwons. However, unlike midterms and finals, many high school students also prepare for the &quot;suneung&quot; through online video lessons on websites that specialize in &quot;suneung&quot; preparation.

===Taiwan===

Cram schools in Taiwan are called &quot;supplementary classes&quot; (補習班), and are not necessarily cram schools in the traditional sense. Almost any kind of extracurricular academic lesson such as music, art, math, and physics can be termed as such, even if students do not attend these classes specifically in order to pass an examination. It&#x27;s a traditional belief that parents should send their children to all kinds of cram schools in order to compete against other talented children. Therefore, most children in Taiwan have a schedule packed with all sorts of cram school lessons. But when they study English, often with a &quot;Native Speaker Teacher&quot;, they are actually studying at a private language school. Furthermore, since this study is ongoing, they are not &quot;cramming&quot; in the traditional sense of the word, and therefore, these language schools are not cram schools by strict definition.

Taiwan is well known for its cram schools. Nearly all students attend some kind of cram school to improve their skills. The meritocratic culture, which requires some skills testing for passports to college, graduate school, and even government service, is dominant on Taiwan&#x27;s policy.

===Thailand===

Cram schooling in Thailand has become almost mandatory to succeed in high school or in the entrance examinations of universities. Cram schools in Thailand, which are called &quot;tutoring institutes&quot;, &quot;tutoring schools&quot;, &quot;special tutoring&quot;, or &quot;special classes&quot; for example, are widespread throughout the country. Some of them do not have instructors in class rooms in a traditional sense; students receive their tuition via television network, which can either relay a live session from another branch or replay a pre-recorded session. Parents generally encourage their children to attend these schools and they sometimes can be perceived as pushy. The system of cram school is currently blamed for discouraging pupils from independent studies.

The main reason given by attending students is to increase understanding in their lessons. The secondary reason of junior high school students is to want to know faster techniques whereas the reason of senior ones is to prepare for exam. The most attended subjects are mathematics for juniors and English language for seniors. Average expense per course is about 2,001–3,000 baht.

Most of the students in the top universities of Thailand have attended at least one cram class, especially in science-based faculties such as science, engineering, medicine, and pharmacy.

&quot;Dek siw&quot;, those who failed in their first year, spend the whole following year studying at home or at a cram school for a better chance of going to a top university like Chulalongkorn University, Thammasart University, Kasetsart University, Mahidol University, or King Mongkut&#x27;s University of Technology Thonburi.

===Turkey===
The &quot;dershane&quot; (plural, &quot;dershaneler&quot;) system was the Turkish counterpart of cram schools. The Turkish &quot;dershane&quot; system resembles Indian and Japanese systems. Students, typically after school and on weekends (especially during the last year), are drilled on various aspects of the (YKS). This is cheaper than private tutoring.

The dershanes were closed due to the AKP-Gülen movement conflict after the AKP government banned them due to the Gülenists being politically active in dershanes. A similar network of cram schools are still active with different names, although still colloquially termed as dershane.

===United Kingdom===
Crammers first appeared in Britain after 1855 when the Civil Service Commission created the Administrative class of government employees, selected by examination and interview rather than patronage. Crammers offered to prepare men of 18 to 25 years old for these examinations, mainly in classics, economics and foreign languages, which would provide entry to civil service or diplomatic careers. The opening scenes of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1971 television opera &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot;, and the 1892 novella by Henry James on which it is based, are set in a military crammer; its master plays an important role in both. Terence Rattigan&#x27;s 1936 play &quot;French Without Tears&quot; is set in a language crammer typical of the period. These civil service crammers did not survive the Second World War. 

Tutorial colleges in the United Kingdom are also called &quot;crammers&quot;, and are attended by some who want to attend the most prestigious universities. They have been around since the early 20th century.

===United States===
A number of businesses, called &quot;tutoring services&quot; or &quot;test preparation centers&quot;, are colloquially known as cram schools. They are used by some GED candidates, and by many third and fourth year students in high schools to prepare for the SAT, ACT, and/or Advanced Placement exams for college admission. Their curriculum is geared more towards vocabulary drills, problem sets, practicing essay composition, and learning effective test-taking strategies. College graduates and undergraduates near graduation will sometimes attend such classes to prepare for entrance exams necessary for graduate level education (i.e. LSAT, DAT, MCAT, GRE).

Review courses for the CPA examination (e.g., Becker Conviser, part of Devry University) and the bar examination (e.g., Barbri) are often taken by undergraduate and graduate students in accountancy and law.

<text>Juan José Arévalo Bermejo (10 September 1904 – 8 October 1990) was a Guatemalan statesman and professor of philosophy who became Guatemala&#x27;s first democratically elected president in 1945. He was elected following a popular uprising against the United States-backed dictator Jorge Ubico that began the Guatemalan Revolution. He remained in office until 1951, surviving 25 coup attempts. He did not contest the election of 1951, instead choosing to hand over power to Jacobo Árbenz. As president, he enacted several social reform policies, including an increase in the minimum wage and a series of literacy programs. He also oversaw the drafting of a new constitution in 1945. He is the father of the current President of Guatemala Bernardo Arévalo.

Because of his reforms and policies that transcended his time, Juan José Arévalo is considered the most popular and influential president in the history of Guatemala.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Arévalo was born in Taxisco, Santa Rosa, on 10 September 1904, son of Mariano Arévalo Bonilla and Elena Bermejo de Paz. He was raised in a lower-middle class family. Beginning in childhood, he showed leadership and intelligence. At age seventeen, he was a fellow student of Luis Martínez Mont, and they became disciples of Professor Miguel Morazán at the Central Normal School for Boys, (from the Spanish &quot;Escuela Normal Central para Varones&quot;).

Martínez Mont and Arévalo developed a close friendship. They studied teaching together and by 1923 they were already exemplary teachers at the Central Normal School for Boys. They also embarked on the creation of a literary magazine, which they called &quot;Alba&quot;. Although it only had four issues, it published texts by renowned Guatemalan writers Rafael Arévalo Martínez, Flavio Herrera, and Carlos Wyld Ospina.

===Teaching career===
In 1927, as part of a nationwide educational reform project, the government of General Lázaro Chacón organized a teacher competition, where the best would be awarded scholarships to study pedagogy abroad. Martínez Mont and Arévalo both won, with the former leaving for Switzerland and the latter for Argentina.

The year 1932 was difficult for Arévalo: the government of General Jorge Ubico decided to cut the monthly pension sent to professors like Arévalo, which allowed them to devote themselves to study. At first they received 175 quetzales per month, but now they would only receive 116 quetzales. This reduction was due to the changes in education made by General Ubico, who did not continue the reform project that had been started by Generals José María Orellana and Lázaro Chacón.

===Presidency===
Arévalo served as Guatemalan president from 15 March 1945 to 15 March 1951. He was elected in 1944, in a contest which is generally reckoned as Guatemala&#x27;s first truly free election. Arévalo won over 86 percent of the vote, more than four times as many votes as the other candidates combined. It is still the largest margin of victory for a free election in the country&#x27;s history.

The six-year-term of Arévalo&#x27;s administration was marked by an unprecedented freedom in the political life of the citizenry. As an educator and philosopher, Arévalo understood the need for advancement in individuals, communities, and nations by practical means. Before his presidency, he had been an exiled university professor. He returned to Guatemala to participate in the reconstruction efforts of the new post-Ubíco government, especially in the areas of social security. He also helped draft a new constitution which granted the people civil rights and liberties they had never previously known. His philosophy of &quot;spiritual socialism,&quot; referred to as &quot;Arevalismo&quot;, may be considered less an economic system than a movement toward the liberation of the imagination of oppressed Latin America. In the post-World War II period, the governments of the United States and other countries misinterpreted Arevalismo as communism, serving as a cause for unease and alarm, which garnered support from neighboring satellite &quot;caudillos&quot; such as Anastasio Somoza García.

Many foreign estates, especially those undeveloped for agriculture, were confiscated and redistributed to peasants; landowners were obliged to provide adequate housing for their workers; new schools, hospitals, and houses were built; and a new minimum wage was introduced.

In Guatemala&#x27;s cities, newly enfranchised labor unions accompanied reformist labor laws that greatly benefitted the urban lower and middle classes. Several parties and trade unions were formed. The enfranchisement of a large proportion of the population was a significant legacy of his term. The benefits did not spread to the rural agrarian areas where hacendado traditions, termed &quot;latifundia&quot;, remained patrician, racist, unyielding, and harsh. Whilst the government made some effort to improve &quot;campesino&quot; peasants&#x27; civil rights, rural conditions in Guatemala could not be improved without large-scale agrarian reform, proposed as mediated and fairly compensated land redistribution. Failure in achieving that was a weakness for Arévalo&#x27;s party in Congress and thus for his administration, which his successor attempted to confront and to remedy with Decree 900.

===Post-presidency===
Arévalo was succeeded by Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán, who continued the agrarian reform approach of Arévalo&#x27;s government. Arévalo freely yielded succession to his presidency in 1951 to Jacobo Árbenz in the second democratic election in Guatemala&#x27;s republican history. Following Árbenz&#x27;s expulsion in 1954, open democracy would not return to a destabilized Guatemala for three decades. Arévalo went into voluntary exile in Mexico as a university professor and writer. In 1956, he would write a notable book called &quot;The Shark and the Sardines,&quot; which attacked the United States Government and powerful American companies for their treatment of Latin America. &quot;The Shark and the Sardines&quot; would be endorsed by American sociologist C. Wright Mills in his 1961 book &quot;Listen Yankee!&quot;

On 27 March 1963, Arévalo returned to Guatemala to announce his candidacy for the November presidential elections. Dictator Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, who (despite the firm opposition of the Kennedy administration) had pledged to oversee a free and open election in which Arévalo would participate, flew into exile to Nicaragua after he was deposed in a coup on 31 March 1963. Enrique Peralta Azurdia then seized power, and Arévalo fled the country again.

===Later years===
Arévalo would return to Guatemala in the mid-1970s, and later held a meeting with civilian Guatemala President Vinicio Cerezo hours after he was inaugurated on 14 January 1986. During the meeting, Arévalo praised the transition from military to civilian rule and even stated that &quot;The October revolution is going to have a second chapter,&quot; though these hopes would soon be dashed by persistent human rights abuses, an ineffectual civilian administration and deep economic problems. On 7 October 1990, Arévalo died in Guatemala City.

==Spiritual socialism (Arevalismo)==

Categorized as a dedicated democrat and nationalist, Juan José Arévalo defined his political philosophy as &quot;spiritual socialism&quot;. The ideology was directed towards the moral development of Guatemalans with the intent to &quot;liberate man psychologically&quot;. Arévalo, the revolution&#x27;s intellectual pillar, positioned his theoretical doctrine as integral to the construction of a progressive and peaceful Guatemalan society. Governments are capable of initiating the formation of an ideal society by allowing citizens the freedom to pursue their own opinions, property and way of life. The revolution&#x27;s first president asserted that safeguarding the free will of citizens generates popular support for governmental institutions, which ensure the security of the individual and collective equally.

Arevalismo did emphasize the importance of civil freedoms as the essential groundwork for human development, but the political principle maintained that &quot;Individual liberty must be exercised within the limits of social order&quot;. Democracy, according to Arévalo, was a social structure that required the restriction of civil rights in the event individual liberties conflict with national security and the will of the majority. The limit on civil rights appears contradictory to the notion of a Guatemalan government that expresses the free will of the people. However, the ambiguity is associated with Arévalo&#x27;s dismissal of classical liberalism as an applicable guideline for Guatemalan governments. Arévalo&#x27;s rejection of Western oriented liberal individualism and apparent socialist inclinations led conservative sectors of the press to denounce the revolutionary president as a communist.

Arévalo opposed classical Marxism&#x27;s materialist tendency and affirmed that &quot;Communism is contrary to human nature, for it is contrary to the psychology of man&quot;. Spiritual socialism&#x27;s anti-communist stance was apparent through Arévalo&#x27;s suppression of various communist influenced initiatives operating in Guatemala. The president exiled several communist activists, declined to legalize the Communist Party of Guatemala, removed government officials with ties to the communist newspaper and shut down the Marxist instruction facility known as Escuela Claridad. Regardless of the aforementioned measures, Arévalo endured nearly 30 attempted coups from members of the Guatemalan military due to his perceived empathy for communists. He responded to anti-communist attacks in a speech to the U.S. Congress in which he said, referring to World War II, &quot;I fear the West has won the battle, but in its blind attacks on social welfare will lose the war to fascism.&quot;

The character of the 1944 revolution, envisioned by Arévalo, was based on the development of a modern social democratic society. A conversion from the remaining presence of feudalistic arrangements to a democratic socialist system was an aspiration of the revolutionary Guatemalan government. Arévalo&#x27;s political philosophy stressed the importance of government intervention in the realm of economic and social interests as necessary to sustain the desires of the majority&#x27;s free will. Deviating from Marxism, Arévalo valued property rights with the aim to subordinate them to benefit Guatemala as a whole if required. Overall, Arévalo sought to improve the social environment of the working majority through a reform of the capitalist mode of production. As a result, Arévalo faced at least 25 unsuccessful coup attempts during his presidency.

==Private life==
Arévalo was married to Elisa Martínez Contreras, but at the time of his presidency they were separated, yet Martínez assumed the role of first lady. He had a relationship with Alaíde Foppa, by whom he had a son, Julio Solórzano Foppa. At the time of his death, he was married to Margarita de Leon and had five children, including the current President of Guatemala Bernardo Arévalo.

== Works ==
He is the author of a scathing allegorical short story &quot;The Shark and the Sardines,&quot; published in 1956. In 1963 he published a sequel entitled &quot;Anti-Communism in Latin America&quot;.

<text>A hyperthermophile is an organism that thrives in extremely hot environments—from 60 °C (140 °F) upwards. An optimal temperature for the existence of hyperthermophiles is often above 80 °C (176 °F). Hyperthermophiles are often within the domain Archaea, although some bacteria are also able to tolerate extreme temperatures. Some of these bacteria are able to live at temperatures greater than 100 °C, deep in the ocean where high pressures increase the boiling point of water. Many hyperthermophiles are also able to withstand other environmental extremes, such as high acidity or high radiation levels. Hyperthermophiles are a subset of extremophiles. Their existence may support the possibility of extraterrestrial life, showing that life can thrive in environmental extremes.

==History==
Hyperthermophiles isolated from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park were first reported by Thomas D. Brock in 1965. Since then, more than 70 species have been established. The most extreme hyperthermophiles live on the superheated walls of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, requiring temperatures of at least 90 °C for survival.
An extraordinary heat-tolerant hyperthermophile is &quot;Geogemma barossii (Strain 121)&quot;, which has been able to double its population during 24 hours in an autoclave at 121 °C (hence its name). The current record growth temperature is 122 °C, for &quot; Methanopyrus kandleri&quot;.

Although no hyperthermophile has shown to thrive at temperatures &gt;122 °C, their existence is possible. Strain 121 survives 130 °C for two hours, but was not able to reproduce until it had been transferred into a fresh growth medium, at a relatively cooler 103 °C.

==Research==
Early research into hyperthermophiles speculated that their genome could be characterized by high guanine-cytosine content; however, recent studies show that &quot;there is no obvious correlation between the GC content of the genome and the optimal environmental growth temperature of the organism.&quot;

The protein molecules in the hyperthermophiles exhibit hyperthermostability—that is, they can maintain structural stability (and therefore function) at high temperatures. Such proteins are homologous to their functional analogs in organisms that thrive at lower temperatures but have evolved to exhibit optimal function at much greater temperatures. Most of the low-temperature homologs of the hyperthermostable proteins would be denatured above 60 °C. Such hyperthermostable proteins are often commercially important, as chemical reactions proceed faster at high temperatures.

== Physiology ==
=== General physiology ===

Due to their extreme environments, hyperthermophiles can be adapted to several variety of factors such as pH, redox potential, level of salinity, and temperature. They grow (similar to mesophiles) within a temperature range of about 25–30 °C between the minimal and maximal temperature. The fastest growth is obtained at their optimal growth temperature which may be up to 106 °C. The main characteristics they present in their morphology are:

* Cell wall: the outermost part of archaea, it is arranged around the cell and protects the cell contents. It does not contain peptidoglycan, which makes them naturally resistant to lysozyme. The most common wall is a paracrystalline surface layer formed by proteins or glycoproteins of hexagonal symmetry. An exception is the genus Thermoplasma which lacks a wall, a deficiency that is filled by the development of a cell membrane with a unique chemical structure, containing a lipid tetraether unit and glucose in a very high proportion to the total lipids. In addition, it is accompanied by glycoproteins that together with lipids give the membrane of &quot;Thermoplasma&quot; species stability against the acidic and thermophilic conditions in which it lives.
* Cytoplasmic membrane: is the main adaptation to temperature. This membrane is radically different from that known from eukaryotes. The membrane of Archaea is built on a tetraether unit, thus establishing ether bonds between glycerol molecules and hydrophobic side chains that do not consist of fatty acids. These side chains are mainly composed of repeating isoprene units. At certain points of the membrane, side chains linked by covalent bonds and a monolayer are found at these points. Thus, the membrane is much more stable and resistant to temperature alterations than the acidic bilayers present in eukaryotic organisms and bacteria. 
* Proteins: denature at elevated temperatures and so also must adapt. Protein complexes known as heat shock proteins assist with proper folding. Their function is to bind or engulf the protein during synthesis, creating an environment conducive to its correct tertiary conformation. In addition, heat shock proteins can collaborate in transporting newly folded proteins to their site of action. 
*DNA: is also adapted to elevated temperatures by several mechanisms. The first is cyclic potassium 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which has been isolated in only a few species of the genus. &quot;Methanopyrus&quot; is characterized by the fact that it prevents DNA damage at these temperatures. Topoisomerase is an enzyme found in all hyperthermophiles. It is responsible for the introduction of positive spins which confer greater stability against high temperatures. Sac7d this protein has been found in the genus and characterized by an increase, up to 40 °C, in the melting temperature of DNA. The histones with which these proteins are associated collaborate in its supercoiling.

== Metabolism ==
Hyperthermophiles have a great diversity in metabolism including chemolithoautotrophy and chemoorganoheterotrophy, while there are no phototrophic hyperthermophiles known. Sugar catabolism involves non-phosphorylated versions of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway some modified versions of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, the canonical Embden-Meyerhof pathway being present only in hyperthermophilic bacteria but not archaea.

Most of what is known about sugar catabolism in hyperthermophiles comes from observation on &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot;. It grows on many different sugars such as starch, maltose, and cellobiose, that once in the cell are transformed to glucose, but other organic substrates can be used as carbon and energy sources. 

Some differences discovered concerned the sugar kinases of starting reactions of this pathway: instead of conventional glucokinase and phosphofructokinase, two novel sugar kinases have been discovered. These enzymes are ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADP-GK) and ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ADP-PFK), they catalyse the same reactions but use ADP as phosphoryl donor, instead of ATP, producing AMP.

=== Adaptations ===
As a rule, hyperthermophiles do not propagate at 50 °C or below, some not even below 80 or 90º. Although unable to grow at ambient temperatures, they are able to survive there for many years. Based on their simple growth requirements, hyperthermophiles could grow in any hot water-containing site, potentially even on other planets and moons like Mars and Europa. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles employ different mechanisms to adapt their cells to heat, especially to the cell wall, plasma membrane, and its biomolecules (DNA, proteins, etc.):

* The presence in their plasma membrane of long-chain and saturated fatty acids in bacteria and &quot;ether&quot; bonds (diether or tetraether) in archaea. In some archaea the membrane has a monolayer structure which further increases its heat resistance.
* Overexpression of GroES and GroEL chaperones that help the correct folding of proteins in situations of cellular stress such as the temperature in which they grow.
* Accumulation of compounds such as potassium diphosphoglycerate that prevent chemical damage (depurination or depyrimidination) to DNA. 
* Production of spermidine that stabilizes DNA, RNA and ribosomes.
* Presence of a DNA reverse DNA gyrase that produces positive supercoiling and stabilizes DNA against heat.
* Presence of proteins with higher content in α-helix regions, more resistant to heat.

===DNA repair===
The hyperthermophilic archaea appear to have special strategies for coping with DNA damage that distinguish these organisms from other organisms. These strategies include an essential requirement for key proteins employed in homologous recombination (a DNA repair process), an apparent lack of the DNA repair process of nucleotide excision repair, and a lack of the MutS/MutL homologs (DNA mismatch repair proteins).

<text>&quot;Peace to the Amir&quot; () is the national anthem of Qatar, written by Sheikh Mubarak bin Sayf Al Thani and composed by Abdulaziz Nassir Al Ubaydan Al Fakhru.

==History and use==
The anthem was adopted on 7 December 1996 upon the accession of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani to the throne. It was first used at a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting held in Qatar in December of that year.

In 2015, Sheikh Mubarak bin Sayf Al Thani presented the first written draft of the anthem to the Qatar National Museum, where it will be put on display.

<doc id="554446" wikidata="Q2473850" url="?curid=554446" title="Chloroflexus aurantiacus">
<text>Chloroflexus aurantiacus is a photosynthetic bacterium isolated from hot springs, belonging to the green non-sulfur bacteria. This organism is thermophilic and can grow at temperatures from . &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; can survive in the dark if oxygen is available. When grown in the dark, &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; has a dark orange color. When grown in sunlight it is dark green. The individual bacteria tend to form filamentous colonies enclosed in sheaths, which are known as trichomes.

==Physiology==
As a genus, &quot;Chloroflexus&quot; spp. are filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic (FAP) organisms that utilize type II photosynthetic reaction centers containing bacteriochlorophyll &quot;a&quot; similar to the purple bacteria, and light-harvesting chlorosomes containing bacteriochlorophyll &quot;c&quot; similar to green sulfur bacteria of the &quot;Chlorobiota&quot;. Like other members of its phylum (&quot;cf.&quot; Chloroflexota), the species stains Gram negative, yet has a single lipid layer (monoderm), but with thin peptidoglycan, which is compensated for by S-layer protein.

As the name implies, these anoxygenic phototrophs do not produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, in contrast to oxygenic phototrophs such as cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants. While oxygenic phototrophs use water as an electron donor for phototrophy, &quot;Chloroflexus&quot; uses reduced sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, or elemental sulfur. This belies their obsolescent name green non-sulfur bacteria; however, &quot;Chloroflexus&quot; spp. can also utilize hydrogen(H2) as a source of electrons.

&quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; is thought to grow photoheterotrophically in nature, but it has the capability of fixing inorganic carbon through photoautotrophic growth. Instead of using the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle typical of plants, &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; has been demonstrated to use an autotrophic pathway known as the 3-Hydroxypropionate pathway.

The complete electron transport chain for &quot;Chloroflexus&quot; spp. is not yet known. Particularly, &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; has not been demonstrated to have a cytochrome &quot;bc1&quot; complex, and may use different proteins to reduce cytochrome &quot;c&quot;.

==Evolution of photosynthesis==
One of the main reasons for interest in &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; is in the study of the evolution of photosynthesis. As terrestrial mammals, we are most familiar with photosynthetic plants such as trees. However, photosynthetic eukaryotes are a relatively recent evolutionary development. Photosynthesis by eukaryotic organisms can be traced back to endosymbiotic events in which non-photosynthetic eukaryotes internalized photosynthetic organisms. The chloroplasts of trees still retain their own DNA as a molecular remnant that indicated their origin as photosynthetic bacteria.

===The &quot;respiration early&quot; hypothesis===
How did photosynthesis arise in bacteria? The answer to this question is complicated by the fact that there are several types of light-harvesting energy capture systems. &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; has been of interest in the search for origins of the so-called type II photosynthetic reaction center. One idea is that bacteria with respiratory electron transport evolved photosynthesis by coupling a light-harvesting energy capture system to the pre-existing respiratory electron transport chain. Thus, rare organisms like &quot;Chloroflexus aurantiacus&quot; that can survive using either respiration or photosynthesis are of interest in on-going attempts to trace the evolution of photosynthesis.

<text>Ottoman Turkish (, ; ) was the standardized register of the Turkish language in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries CE). It borrowed extensively, in all aspects, from Arabic and Persian. It was written in the Ottoman Turkish alphabet. Ottoman Turkish was largely unintelligible to the less-educated lower-class and to rural Turks, who continued to use (&quot;raw/vulgar Turkish&quot;; compare Vulgar Latin and Demotic Greek), which used far fewer foreign loanwords and is the basis of the modern standard. The Tanzimât era (1839–1876) saw the application of the term &quot;Ottoman&quot; when referring to the language ( or ); Modern Turkish uses the same terms when referring to the language of that era ( and ). More generically, the Turkish language was called or &quot;Turkish&quot;.

==History==
Historically, Ottoman Turkish was transformed in three eras:

* اسکی عثمانلی تورکچه‌سی (Old Ottoman Turkish): the version of Ottoman Turkish used until the 16th century. It was almost identical with the Turkish used by Seljuk empire and Anatolian beyliks and was often regarded as part of اسکی آناطولی تورکچه‌سی (Old Anatolian Turkish).
* اورتا عثمانلی تورکچه‌سی (Middle Ottoman Turkish) or (Classical Ottoman Turkish): the language of poetry and administration from the 16th century until Tanzimat. 
* یڭی عثمانلی تورکچه‌سی (New Ottoman Turkish): the version shaped from the 1850s to the 20th century under the influence of journalism and Western-oriented literature.

===Language reform===
In 1928, following the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, widespread language reforms (a part in the greater framework of Atatürk&#x27;s reforms) instituted by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk saw the replacement of many Persian and Arabic origin loanwords in the language with their Turkish equivalents. One of the main supporters of the reform was the Turkish nationalist Ziya Gökalp. It also saw the replacement of the Perso-Arabic script with the extended Latin alphabet. The changes were meant to encourage the growth of a new variety of written Turkish that more closely reflected the spoken vernacular and to foster a new variety of spoken Turkish that reinforced Turkey&#x27;s new national identity as being a post-Ottoman state.

See the list of replaced loanwords in Turkish for more examples of Ottoman Turkish words and their modern Turkish counterparts. Two examples of Arabic and two of Persian loanwords are found below.

==Legacy==
Historically speaking, Ottoman Turkish is the predecessor of modern Turkish. However, the standard Turkish of today is essentially (Turkish of Turkey) as written in the Latin alphabet and with an abundance of neologisms added, which means there are now far fewer loan words from other languages, and Ottoman Turkish was not instantly transformed into the Turkish of today. At first, it was only the script that was changed, and while some households continued to use the Arabic system in private, most of the Turkish population was illiterate at the time, making the switch to the Latin alphabet much easier. Then, loan words were taken out, and new words fitting the growing amount of technology were introduced. Until the 1960s, Ottoman Turkish was at least partially intelligible with the Turkish of that day. One major difference between Ottoman Turkish and modern Turkish is the latter&#x27;s abandonment of compound word formation according to Arabic and Persian grammar rules. The usage of such phrases still exists in modern Turkish but only to a very limited extent and usually in specialist contexts; for example, the Persian genitive construction (which reads literally as &quot;the preordaining of the divine&quot; and translates as &quot;divine dispensation&quot; or &quot;destiny&quot;) is used, as opposed to the normative modern Turkish construction, (literally, &quot;divine preordaining&quot;).

In 2014, Turkey&#x27;s Education Council decided that Ottoman Turkish should be taught in Islamic high schools and as an elective in other schools, a decision backed by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who said the language should be taught in schools so younger generations do not lose touch with their cultural heritage.

==Writing system==
Most Ottoman Turkish was written in the Ottoman Turkish alphabet (), a variant of the Perso-Arabic script. The Armenian, Greek and Rashi script of Hebrew were sometimes used by Armenians, Greeks and Jews. (See Karamanli Turkish, a dialect of Ottoman written in the Greek script; Armeno-Turkish alphabet)

==Grammar==

The actual grammar of Ottoman Turkish is not different from the grammar of modern Turkish.The focus of this section is on the Ottoman orthography; the conventions surrounding how the orthography interacted and dealt with grammatical morphemes related to conjugations, cases, pronouns, etc.

===Cases===
* Nominative and Indefinite accusative/objective: -∅, no suffix. &#x27;the lake&#x27; &#x27;a lake&#x27;, &#x27;soup&#x27;, &#x27;night&#x27;; &#x27;he/she brought a rabbit&#x27;.
* Genitive: suffix . &#x27;of the pasha&#x27;; &#x27;of the book&#x27;.
* Definite accusative: suffix : &#x27;he/she brought the rabbit&#x27;. The variant suffix does not occur in Ottoman Turkish orthography (unlike in Modern Turkish), although it&#x27;s pronounced with the vowel harmony. Thus, &#x27;the lake&#x27; &quot;vs.&quot; Modern Turkish .
* Dative: suffix : &#x27;to the house&#x27;.
* Locative: suffix : &#x27;at school&#x27;, &#x27;in (the/a) cage&#x27;, &#x27;at a/the start&#x27;, &#x27;in town&#x27;. The variant suffix used in Modern Turkish () does not occur.
* Ablative: suffix : &#x27;from the man&#x27;.
* Instrumental: suffix or postposition . Generally not counted as a grammatical case in modern grammars.

Table below lists nouns with a variety of phonological features that come into play when taking case suffixes. The table includes a typical singular and plural noun, containing back and front vowels, words that end with the letter ([a] or [e]), both back and front vowels, word that ends in a ([t]) sound, and word that ends in either or ([k]). These words are to serve as references, to observe orthographic conventions:

* Which vowels are written using the 4 letters: &quot;ʾalif&quot; , &quot;wāw&quot; , &quot;hāʾ&quot; , and &quot;yāʾ&quot; ; and which are not;
* Where words or morphemes are connected to each other, and where they are separated with the use of Zero-width non-joiner.
* where a final letter is softened when followed by a vowel sound, and when not; both in Ottoman orthography and in modern Latin orthography. 
* Where harmony of vowel roundness exists in spoken pronunciation, and in modern Latin orthography, but not in Ottoman orthography.
* Where the letter is used and when the letter .

=== Possessives ===

Table below shows the suffixes for creating possessed nouns. Each of these possessed nouns, in turn, take case suffixes as shown above.

For third person (singular and plural) possessed nouns, that end in a vowel, when it comes to taking case suffixes, a letter [n] comes after the possessive suffix. For singular endings, the final vowel is removed in all instances. For plural endings, if the letter succeeding the additional [n] is a vowel, the final vowel is kept; otherwise it is removed (note the respective examples for &quot;kitaplarını&quot; versus &quot;kitaplarından&quot;). Examples below :

=== Verbs ===

Below table shows the positive conjugation for two sample verbs &quot;açmak&quot; (to open) and &quot;sevilmek&quot; (to be loved). The first verb is the active verb, and the other has been modified to form a passive verb. The first contains back vowels, the second front vowels; both containing non-rounded vowels (which also impacts pronunciation and modern Latin orthography).

====Negation and complex verbs====

Below table shows the conjugation of a negative verb, and a positive complex verb expressing ability. In Turkish, complex verbs can be constructed by adding a variety of suffixes to the base root of a verb. The two verbs are &quot;yazmamaq&quot; (not to write) and &quot;sevebilmek&quot; (to be able to love).

====Compound verbs====

Another common category of verbs in Turkish (more common in Ottoman Turkish than in modern Turkish), is compound verbs. This consists of adding a Persian or Arabic active or passive participle to a neuter verb, &quot;to do&quot; ( &quot;etmek&quot;) or &quot;to become&quot; ( &quot;olmaq&quot;). For example, note the following two verbs:

* &quot;razı olmaq&quot; (to consent) ;
* &quot;katletmek&quot; (to slaughter); &quot;teşekkür etmek&quot; (to thank);
* &quot;iyi olunmak&quot; (to get better).

Below table shows some sample conjugations of these two verbs. The conjugation of the verb &quot;etmek&quot; isn&#x27;t straightforward, because the root of the verb ends in a [t]. This sound transforms into a [d] when followed by a vowel sound. This is reflected in conventions of Ottoman orthography as well.

====&#x27;to be&#x27; and &#x27;not to be&#x27; Verbs====

In Turkish, there is a verb representing &quot;to be&quot;, but it is a defective verb. It doesn&#x27;t have an infinitive or several other tenses. It is usually a suffix.

Negative verb &quot;to be&quot; is created with the use of the word &quot;değil&quot;, followed by the appropriate conjugation of the &quot;to be&quot; verb; or optionally used as a standalone for 3rd person.

* / &quot;ben işçi değilim&quot;: &#x27;I am not a worker&#x27;
* / &quot;o çiftçi değildir&quot;: &#x27;he is not a farmer&#x27;
* / &quot;o çiftçi değil&quot;: &#x27;he is not a farmer&#x27;
* / &quot;Eğer kendim için hazır değilseydim.&quot;: &#x27;If I&#x27;m not ready for myself.&#x27;

====&#x27;to exist/have&#x27; and &#x27;not to exist/have&#x27; Verbs====

Generally, the verbs &#x27;to exist&#x27; and &#x27;to have&#x27; are expressed using what&#x27;s called an existential copula, the word &quot;var&quot;.

* / &quot;ev var.&quot;: &#x27;There is a house&#x27;

The verb &#x27;to have&#x27; is expressed in the same way, except that the object noun will take a possessive pronoun, producing sentences that will literally mean &quot;there exists house of mine&quot;.

* / &quot;evim var.&quot;: &#x27;I have a house&#x27;

The verbs &#x27;to exist&#x27; and &#x27;to have&#x27; conjugated for other tenses, are expressed in the same way, with a possessive pronoun if needed, and copula &quot;var&quot;, followed by the 3rd person singular form of the verb &#x27;to do: &quot;etmek&quot; attached as a suffix (or separate as a stanadalone verb); as conjugated in the above section.

* / &quot;evin vardı.&quot;: &#x27;You had a house&#x27;
* / &quot;bina varmalıydı.&quot;: &#x27;There had to be a building&#x27;

The verbs &#x27;not to exist&#x27; and &#x27;not to have&#x27; are created in the exact same manner and conjugation, except that the copula &quot;yok&quot; is used.

* / &quot;ev yok.&quot;: &#x27;There isn&#x27;t a house&#x27;
* / &quot;evim yok.&quot;: &#x27;I don&#x27;t have a house&#x27;
* / &quot;evin yoktu.&quot;: &#x27;You didn&#x27;t have a house&#x27;
* / &quot;bina yokmalıydı.&quot;: &#x27;There must not have been a building&#x27;

=== Verb Construction ===

Turkish being an agglutinative language as opposed to an analytical one (generally), means that from a single root verb, with the addition of a variety of morphemes and suffixes, multiple new and different verbs meanings can be expressed in single but larger words.

Below table is a sample from the verb &quot;tepmek&quot; meaning &#x27;to kick&#x27;, whose root (which is also 2nd person imperative) is &quot;tep&quot;. Each of the produced new verbs below can be made into an infinitive with the addition of &quot;-mek&quot; at the end.

==Structure==

Ottoman Turkish was highly influenced by Arabic and Persian. Arabic and Persian words in the language accounted for up to 88% of its vocabulary. As in most other Turkic and foreign languages of Islamic communities, the Arabic borrowings were borrowed through Persian, not through direct exposure of Ottoman Turkish to Arabic, a fact that is evidenced by the typically Persian phonological mutation of the words of Arabic origin.

The conservation of archaic phonological features of the Arabic borrowings furthermore suggests that Arabic-incorporated Persian was absorbed into pre-Ottoman Turkic at an early stage, when the speakers were still located to the north-east of Persia, prior to the westward migration of the Islamic Turkic tribes. An additional argument for this is that Ottoman Turkish shares the Persian character of its Arabic borrowings with other Turkic languages that had even less interaction with Arabic, such as Tatar, Bashkir, and Uyghur. From the early ages of the Ottoman Empire, borrowings from Arabic and Persian were so abundant that original Turkish words were hard to find. In Ottoman, one may find whole passages in Arabic and Persian incorporated into the text. It was however not only extensive loaning of words, but along with them much of the grammatical systems of Persian and Arabic.

In a social and pragmatic sense, there were (at least) three variants of Ottoman Turkish:

* فصیح تورکچه (Eloquent Turkish): the language of poetry and administration, Ottoman Turkish in its strict sense;
* اورتا تورکچه (Middle Turkish): the language of higher classes and trade;
* قبا تورکچه (Rough Turkish): the language of lower classes.

A person would use each of the varieties above for different purposes, with the variant being the most heavily suffused with Arabic and Persian words and the least. For example, a scribe would use the Arabic () to refer to honey when writing a document but would use the native Turkish word () when buying it.

== Transliterations ==

The transliteration system of the has become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard in Oriental studies for the transliteration of Ottoman Turkish texts. In transcription, the New Redhouse, Karl Steuerwald, and Ferit Devellioğlu dictionaries have become standard. Another transliteration system is the (DMG), which provides a transliteration system for any Turkic language written in Arabic script. There are few differences between the İA and the DMG systems.

<doc id="554469" wikidata="Q12758989" url="?curid=554469" title="Stratum">
<text>In geology and related fields, a stratum (: strata) is a layer of rock or sediment characterized by certain lithologic properties or attributes that distinguish it from adjacent layers from which it is separated by visible surfaces known as either &quot;bedding surfaces&quot; or &quot;bedding planes&quot;. Prior to the publication of the International Stratigraphic Guide, older publications have defined a stratum as being either equivalent to a single bed or composed of a number of beds; as a layer greater than 1 cm in thickness and constituting a part of a bed; or a general term that includes both &quot;bed&quot; and &quot;lamina&quot;. Related terms are &quot;substrate&quot; and &quot;substratum&quot; (pl.&quot;substrata&quot;), a stratum underlying another stratum.

==Characteristics==
Typically, a stratum is generally one of a number of parallel layers that lie one upon another to form enormous thicknesses of strata. The bedding surfaces (bedding planes) that separate strata represent episodic breaks in deposition associated either with periodic erosion, cessation of deposition, or some combination of the two. Stacked together with other strata, individual stratum can form composite stratigraphic units that can extend over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Individual stratum can cover similarly large areas. Strata are typically seen as bands of different colored or differently structured material exposed in cliffs, road cuts, quarries, and river banks. Individual bands may vary in thickness from a few millimeters to several meters or more. A band may represent a specific mode of deposition: river silt, beach sand, coal swamp, sand dune, lava bed, etc.

==Types of stratum==
In the study of rock and sediment strata, geologists have recognized a number of different types of strata, including &quot;bed&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;, &quot;band&quot;, and &quot;key bed&quot;. A bed is a single stratum that is lithologically distinguishable from other layers above and below it. In the classification hierarchy of sedimentary lithostratigraphic units, a bed is the smallest formal unit. However, only beds that are distinctive enough to be useful for stratigraphic correlation and geologic mapping are customarily given formal names and considered formal lithostratigraphic units. The volcanic equivalent of a bed, a flow, is a discrete extrusive volcanic stratum or body distinguishable by texture, composition, or other objective criteria. As in case of a bed, a flow should only be designated and named as a formal lithostratigraphic unit when it is distinctive, widespread, and useful for stratigraphic correlation. A band is a thin stratum that is distinguishable by a distinctive lithology or color and is useful in correlating strata. Finally, a key bed, also called a &quot;marker bed&quot;, is a well-defined, easily identifiable stratum or body of strata that has sufficiently distinctive characteristics, such as lithology or fossil content, to be recognized and correlated during geologic field or subsurface mapping.

<text>Googleshare is a measure of mindshare based on the results of Google search engine queries. It is a percentage measuring how closely one thing belongs to another according to page counts returned by Google (similar measures using other search engines are possible). The idea was proposed by Steven Berlin Johnson in a 2002 weblog post, and the term was coined by Gene Smith.

==Example==
For example, you can query Google for &quot;Beatles&quot; and &quot;Paul&quot;, versus &quot;Beatles&quot; and &quot;Ringo&quot;, and see who has a higher Googleshare for &quot;Beatles&quot;. All one needs to do is calculate the percentage of the page count with the extra keyword, compared to the page count without the extra keyword.

The calculation in this example runs as follows.

&quot;Ringo&quot;&#x27;s Googleshare of &quot;Beatles&quot; is therefore (790000 / 4990000) * 100 = 15.83%; over 15% of webpages mentioning &quot;Beatles&quot; also mention &quot;Ringo&quot;. Compared to other randomly selected names, this is high—we can therefore assume &quot;Ringo&quot; and &quot;Beatles&quot; are somehow connected, though correlation does not imply causation.

<doc id="554471" wikidata="Q8463304" url="?curid=554471" title="Cafeteria">
<text>A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service location in which there is little or no waiting staff table service, whether in a restaurant or within an institution such as a large office building or school; a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or  (in American English). Cafeterias are different from coffeehouses, although the English term came from the Spanish term &quot;cafetería&quot;, which carries the same meaning.

Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths. Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray. In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting. Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table. For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at check-out, and fill the container after check-out. Free unlimited-second servings are often allowed under this system. For legal purposes (and the consumption patterns of customers), this system is rarely, if at all, used for alcoholic drinks in the United States.

Customers are either charged a flat rate for admission (as in a buffet) or pay at check-out for each item. Some self-service cafeterias charge by the weight of items on a patron&#x27;s plate. In universities and colleges, some students pay for three meals a day by making a single large payment for the entire semester.

As cafeterias require few employees, they are often found within a larger institution, catering to the employees or clientele of that institution. For example, schools, colleges and their residence halls, department stores, hospitals, museums, places of worship, amusement parks, military bases, prisons, factories, and office buildings often have cafeterias. Although some of such institutions self-operate their cafeterias, many outsource their cafeterias to a food service management company or lease space to independent businesses to operate food service facilities. The three largest food service management companies servicing institutions are Aramark, Compass Group, and Sodexo.

At one time, upscale cafeteria-style restaurants dominated the culture of the Southern United States, and to a lesser extent the Midwest. There were numerous prominent chains of them: Bickford&#x27;s, Morrison&#x27;s Cafeteria, Piccadilly Cafeteria, S&amp;W Cafeteria, Apple House, Luby&#x27;s, K&amp;W, Britling, Wyatt&#x27;s Cafeteria, and Blue Boar among them. Currently, two Midwestern chains still exist, Sloppy Jo&#x27;s Lunchroom and Manny&#x27;s, which are both located in Illinois. There were also several smaller chains, usually located in and around a single city. These institutions, except K&amp;W, went into a decline in the 1960s with the rise of fast food and were largely finished off in the 1980s by the rise of all-you-can-eat buffets and other casual dining establishments. A few chains—particularly Luby&#x27;s and Piccadilly Cafeterias (which took over the Morrison&#x27;s chain in 1998)—continue to fill some of the gap left by the decline of the older chains. Some of the smaller Midwestern chains, such as MCL Cafeterias centered in Indianapolis, are still in business.

==History==

Perhaps the first self-service restaurant (not necessarily a cafeteria) in the U.S. was the Exchange Buffet in New York City, which opened September 4, 1885, and catered to an exclusively male clientele. Food was purchased at a counter and patrons ate standing up. This represents the predecessor of two formats: the cafeteria, described below, and the automat.

During the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, entrepreneur John Kruger built an American version of the smörgåsbords he had seen while traveling in Sweden. Emphasizing the simplicity and light fare, he called it the &#x27;Cafeteria&#x27; - Spanish for &#x27;coffee shop&#x27;. The exposition attracted over 27 million visitors (half the U.S. population at the time) in six months, and it was because of Kruger&#x27;s operation that the United States first heard the term and experienced the self-service dining format.

Meanwhile, the chain of Childs Restaurants quickly grew from about 10 locations in New York City in 1890 to hundreds across the U.S. and Canada by 1920. Childs is credited with the innovation of adding trays and a &quot;tray line&quot; to the self-service format, introduced in 1898 at their 130 Broadway location. Childs did not change its format of sit-down dining, however. This was soon the standard design for most Childs Restaurants, and, ultimately, the dominant method for succeeding cafeterias.

It has been conjectured that the &#x27;cafeteria craze&#x27; started in May 1905, when Helen Mosher opened a downtown L.A. restaurant where people chose their food at a long counter and carried their trays to their tables. California has a long history in the cafeteria format - notably the Boos Brothers Cafeterias, and the Clifton&#x27;s and Schaber&#x27;s. The earliest cafeterias in California were opened at least 12 years after Kruger&#x27;s Cafeteria, and Childs already had many locations around the country. Horn &amp; Hardart, an automat format chain (different from cafeterias), was well established in the mid-Atlantic region before 1900.

Between 1960 and 1981, the popularity of cafeterias was overcome by fast food restaurants and fast casual restaurant formats.

Outside the United States, the development of cafeterias can be observed in France as early as 1881 with the passing of the Ferry Law. This law mandated that public school education be available to all children. Accordingly, the government also encouraged schools to provide meals for students in need, thus resulting in the conception of cafeterias or cantine (in French). According to Abramson, before the creation of cafeterias, only some students could bring home-cooked meals and be properly fed in schools.

As cafeterias in France became more popular, their use spread beyond schools and into the workforce. Thus, due to pressure from workers and eventually new labor laws, sizable businesses had to, at minimum, provide established eating areas for their workers. Support for this practice was also reinforced by the effects of World War II when the importance of national health and nutrition came under great attention.

==Other names==
A cafeteria in a U.S. military installation is known as a chow hall, a mess hall, a galley, a mess deck, or, more formally, a dining facility, often abbreviated to DF, whereas in common British Armed Forces parlance, it is known as a cookhouse or mess. Students in the United States often refer to cafeterias as lunchrooms, which also often serve school breakfast. Some school cafeterias in the U.S. and Canada have stages and movable seating that allow use as auditoriums. These rooms are known as or All Purpose Rooms. In some older facilities, a school&#x27;s gymnasium is also often used as a cafeteria, with the kitchen facility being hidden behind a rolling partition outside non-meal hours. Newer rooms which also act as the school&#x27;s grand entrance hall for crowd control and are used for multiple purposes are often called the commons.

Cafeterias serving university dormitories are sometimes called &quot;dining halls&quot; or &quot;dining commons&quot;. A food court is a type of cafeteria found in many shopping malls and airports featuring multiple food vendors or concessions. However, a food court could equally be styled as a type of restaurant as well, being more aligned with the public, rather than institutionalized, dining. Some institutions, especially schools, have food courts with stations offering different types of food served by the institution itself (self-operation) or a single contract management company, rather than leasing space to numerous businesses. Some monasteries, boarding schools, and older universities refer to their cafeteria as a &quot;refectory&quot;. Modern-day British cathedrals and abbeys, notably in the Church of England, often use the phrase refectory to describe a cafeteria open to the public. Historically, the refectory was generally only used by monks and priests. For example, although the original 800-year-old refectory at Gloucester Cathedral (the stage setting for dining scenes in the Harry Potter movies) is now mostly used as a choir practice area, the relatively modern 300-year-old extension, now used as a cafeteria by staff and public alike, is today referred to as the refectory.

A cafeteria located within a movie or TV studio complex is often called a commissary.

==College cafeteria==

In American English, a &quot;college cafeteria&quot; is a cafeteria intended for college students. In British English, it is often called the &quot;refectory&quot;. These cafeterias can be a part of a residence hall or in a separate building. Many of these colleges employ their students to work in the cafeteria. The number of meals served to students varies from school to school but is normally around 21 meals per week. Like normal cafeterias, a person will have a tray to select the food that they want, but (at some campuses) instead of paying money, pays beforehand by purchasing a meal plan. 

The method of payment for college cafeterias is commonly in the form of a meal plan, whereby the patron pays a certain amount at the start of the semester and details of the plan are stored on a computer system. Student ID cards are then used to access the meal plan. Meal plans can vary widely in their details and are often not necessary to eat at a college cafeteria. Typically, the college tracks students&#x27; plan usage by counting the number of predefined meal servings, points, dollars, or buffet dinners. The plan may give the student a certain number of any of the above per week or semester and they may or may not roll over to the next week or semester.

Many schools offer several different options for using their meal plans. The main cafeteria is usually where most of the meal plan is used but smaller cafeterias, cafés, restaurants, bars, or even fast food chains located on campus, on nearby streets, or in the surrounding town or city may accept meal plans. A college cafeteria system often has a virtual monopoly on the students due to an isolated location or a requirement that residence contracts include a full meal plan. 

==Taiwanese cafeteria==
There are many self-service bento shops in Taiwan. The store puts the dishes in the self-service area for the customers to pick them up by themselves. After the customers choose, they go to the cashier to check out; many stores use the staff to visually check the amount of food when assessing the price, and some stores use the method of weighing.

<text>Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, KB, PC (c. 1575 – September 1633) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1601 to 1622. He was created Viscount Falkland in the Scottish peerage in 1620. He was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1622 until 1629.

==Early life==
Cary was the son of Sir Edward Cary, of Berkhamsted and Aldenham, Hertfordshire, Master and Treasurer of His Majesty&#x27;s Jewels, and his wife Katherine Knyvett or Knevet, daughter of Sir Henry Knyvett or Knevet, Master of the Jewel Office to Queen Elizabeth and King James, and wife Anne Pickering, and widow of Henry Paget, 2nd Baron Paget. His father was the son of Sir John Cary (d. 9 September 1552) and wife Joyce Denny (d. from 10 November 1560 to 30 January 1561) and nephew of Sir William Carey.

He entered Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1590 and entered Exeter College, Oxford in 1593 at the age of sixteen. According to Wood, by the aid of a good tutor Cary became highly accomplished. Subsequently, he served in France and the Low Countries, and was taken prisoner by Don Luis de Velasco, probably at the Siege of Ostend (a fact referred to in the epigram on Sir Henry Cary by Ben Jonson).

==Court of Elizabeth I and James I==
On his return to England Cary was introduced to court, and became Gentleman of the Bedchamber. He was knighted at Dublin in 1599. In 1601 he was elected Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire. He was a JP for Hertfordshire in 1601. He became joint master of the jewels with his father on 21 June 1603. In 1604 he was re-elected MP for Hertfordshire.

Henry Cary danced in &quot;Hymenaei&quot;, the masque at the wedding of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex and Frances Howard on 5 January 1606. During the progress of Anne of Denmark in April 1613, Cary performed in the masque at Caversham Park.

At the investiture of Charles Prince of Wales in 1616 he was created a Knight of the Bath In 1617 he became Comptroller of the Household and a Privy Councillor. He succeeded to the family estates on the death of his father in 1618. He was created Viscount Falkland in the county of Fife, in the Scottish peerage on 10 November 1620 (the title, with his naturalisation, was confirmed by Charles I by diploma in 1627). In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Hertfordshire; his Scots peerage not barring him from sitting in the English Commons, as an English peerage would.

Chiefly through the favour of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham Cary was appointed to succeed Sir Oliver St John, as Lord Deputy of Ireland. His patent was sealed in March 1622 and he was sworn on 18 September 1622. In office he showed himself both bigoted in his opinions and timid in carrying out a policy which continually dallied with extremes. Although he was conscientious, he was easily offended, and he failed to conduct himself with credit when confronted with any unusual difficulties.

Falkland was greatly distressed at the number of priests in Ireland and their influence over the people. He was influenced by a sermon of James Ussher on the text &quot;He beareth not the sword in vain&quot;, and issued a proclamation on 21 January 1623, ordering their banishment from the country. This proclamation was highly inappropriate at the time because of the (ultimately unsuccessful) negotiations for the Spanish marriage of the Prince of Wales. In February 1624 he received an order from the English privy council to refrain from more extreme measures than preventing the erection of religious houses and the congregation of unlawful assemblies.

==Service under Charles I==
Falkland convened an assembly of the nobility of Ireland on 22 September 1626, on account of the difficulties of maintaining the English army in Ireland. He laid before the assembly a draft of concessions promised by Charles, which were subsequently known as the &quot;Graces&quot;. They promised the removal of certain religious disabilities and the recognition of sixty years&#x27; possession as a bar to all claims of the crown based on irregularities of title. Falkland did not conduct the negotiations with skill, and for a long time there seemed no hope of a satisfactory settlement. Finally in May 1628, a deputation from the nobility agreed, before the king and privy council at Whitehall, on certain additional concessions in the &quot;Graces&quot; and then confirmed, that Ireland should provide a sum of £4,000 for the army for three years.

Falkland believed that his difficulties with the nobility had been largely due to the intrigues of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Adam, Viscount Loftus, After the dissolution of the assembly of the nobility in 1627, he brought a charge against Loftus of malversation, and of giving encouragement to the nobility to refuse supplies. After the case had been heard in London, Lord Loftus was allowed to return to his duties pending further inquiry.

Falkland had for some years been engaged in tracking out what he supposed was a dangerous conspiracy of the Byrnes of Wicklow, and in August 1628 was able to announce to Charles I that the result of his protracted investigations had been successful, a true bill having been found against them at the Wicklow assizes. The aim of Falkland was to set up a plantation in Wicklow on the confiscated estates of the Byrnes, but as his designs were disapproved of by the commissioners of Irish causes, the king appointed a committee of the Irish privy council to investigate the matter more fully. Falkland took deep offence because one of the members of committee was the lord chancellor, Loftus and he refused to afford any assistance in the investigation on account of the &quot;high indignity&quot; offered to himself. When, as the result of the inquiry, it was discovered that the Byrnes had been the victims of false witnesses, Falkland was, on 10 August 1629, directed to hand over his authority to the lords justices on the pretext that his services were required in England. Charles I, recognising his good intentions, continued him in favour.

Cary broke his leg, which then had to be amputated, in Theobalds Park and as a result, he died in September 1633. He was buried on 25 September 1633 at Aldenham.

==Patron of the arts==
Falkland continued throughout his life to cultivate his literary tastes. An epitaph by him on Elizabeth, countess of Huntingdon, is given in Wilford&#x27;s &#x27;Memorials.&#x27; Among his papers was found &#x27;The History of the most unfortunate Prince, King Edward II, with choice political observations on him and his unhappy favourites, Gaveston and Spencer,’ which was published with a preface attributed to Sir James Harrington in 1680. Falkland was in the habit of ingeniously concealing the year of his age in a knot flourished beneath his name, a device by which he is said to have detected a forger who had failed to recognise its significance.

==Family==
Cary married, in 1602, Elizabeth Tanfield (1585–1639), daughter and heiress of Sir Lawrence Tanfield, lord chief baron of the exchequer, and his first wife, Elizabeth Symonds. 

Elizabeth Tanfield was 16 or 17 years old at the time of the marriage and had a high reputation for her learning. In very early years she showed a strong inclination for the study of languages, mastering French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hebrew, and Transylvanian. She converted to Roman Catholicism when she was about nineteen years of age. However, she reportedly did not publicly acknowledge this until twenty years later.

Elizabeth accompanied her husband to Dublin, where she took a great interest in the establishment of industrial schools. When Cary learned of her change of faith they quarrelled, and she left Dublin in 1625. The Privy Council allowed her a separate maintenance of £500 a year. After her husband&#x27;s return to England they became reconciled, but continued to live separately. On account of her change of faith, her father probably passed her over in his will (for the circumstances see under Lucius Cary). When her husband died she had only the annuity of £200 a year from her parents. She died in October 1639, aged 53 or 54.

One of the most intimate friends of Lady Falkland was William Chillingworth, but after his conversion to Protestantism she blamed him for endeavouring to pervert her children. She published a translation of French Cardinal Jacques Davy Duperron&#x27;s reply to the attack on his works by King James, but the book was ordered burned. Afterwards she translated the whole of Perron&#x27;s works for the benefit of scholars at Oxford and Cambridge, which was never printed. She also wrote in verse the lives of St Mary Magdalene, St Agnes the Martyr, and St Elizabeth of Portugal, as well as numerous hymns in honour of the Virgin Mary. The collected edition of the works of John Marston (1633) was dedicated to her. 

Of the 11 children of Lord and Lady Falkland there are records of ten -- four sons and six daughters:
*Lucius, became 2nd Viscount Falkland but during his father&#x27;s life was confined in the Fleet prison, his father&#x27;s petition to the king praying for the release of his son, is preserved in the Harleian MS. 1581, where there are also four letters to Falkland from the Duke of Buckingham, has been printed in the &quot;Cabala&quot;.
*Lawrence (Lorenzo), was knighted and was killed fighting under Sir Charles Coote (the elder) at Battle of Swords in 1642.
*Patrick, was the author of some poems
* Catherine (d. 1625) married James Home, 2nd Earl of Home
* Placid (Henry), took Holy Orders in the Catholic Church
* Four daughters -- Anne, who had been maid of honour to the queen, Lucy, Elizabeth, and Mary -- became nuns in the Convent of Cambrai. Their religious names were, respectively, Magdelena, Mary, Augustina and Clementia.
* A fifth daughter, Victoria Cary, was a maid of honour at court and performed the masque &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. She married Sir William Uvedale MP (1581–1652). One of their daughters, Elizabeth, married Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle

<text>Thomas Chalmers (17 March 178031 May 1847), was a Scottish Presbyterian minister, professor of theology, political economist, and a leader of both the Church of Scotland and of the Free Church of Scotland. He has been called &quot;Scotland&#x27;s greatest nineteenth-century churchman&quot;.

He served as Vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1835 to 1842.

The New Zealand town of Port Chalmers was named after Chalmers. A bust of Chalmers is on display in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.

The Thomas Chalmers Centre in Kirkliston is named after him.

==Early life==

He was born at Anstruther in Fife, the son of Elizabeth Hall and John Chalmers, a merchant.

Age 11 Chalmers attended the University of St Andrews studying mathematics. In January 1799 he was licensed as a preacher of the gospel by the St Andrews presbytery. In May 1803, after attending further courses of lectures at the University of Edinburgh, and acting as assistant to the professor of mathematics at St Andrews, he was ordained as minister of Kilmany, about 9 miles from the university town, where he continued to lecture. Kilmany was a small and predominantly agricultural parish, with a population under 800 in 1811.

==Lecturer and minister==
Chalmers made an issue within the University of St Andrews of the quality of mathematics teaching. It came to involve attacks on John Rotheram, the professor of natural philosophy. His mathematical lectures roused enthusiasm, but they were discontinued by order of the authorities. Chalmers then opened mathematical classes on his own account which attracted many students; at the same time he delivered a course of lectures on chemistry, and ministered to his parish at Kilmany. In 1805 he became a candidate for the vacant professorship of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, but was unsuccessful.

In 1815 he became minister of the Tron Church, Glasgow, in spite of determined opposition to him in the town council on the grounds of his evangelical teaching. From Glasgow his reputation as a preacher spread throughout the United Kingdom. When he visited London Samuel Wilberforce wrote, &quot;all the world is wild about Dr Chalmers.&quot; At this time he lived at Wellington Place in Glasgow.

==Parochial work==
In November 1817 Chalmers used a memorial sermon for Princess Charlotte of Wales to appeal for a Christian effort to deal with the social condition of Glasgow. His parish contained about 11,000 persons, and of these about one-third were not connected with any church. He considered that parochial organizations had not kept pace in the city with the growing population. He declared that twenty new churches, with parishes, should be erected in Glasgow; and he set to work to revive the old parochial economy of Scotland. The town council agreed to build one new church, attaching to it a parish of 10,000 persons, mostly weavers, labourers and factory workers, and this church was offered to Chalmers.

In September 1819 he became minister of the church and parish of St John, where of 2000 families more than 800 had no connection with any Christian church. He first addressed himself to providing schools for the children. Two school-houses with four endowed teachers were established, where 700 children were taught, at moderate fees. Between 40 and 50 local Sabbath schools were opened, where more than 1000 children were taught. The parish was divided into 25 districts with 60 to 100 families. Chalmers was the centre of the whole system, visiting families and holding evening meetings.

==Moral philosopher and theologian==

In 1823 Chalmers accepted the chair of moral philosophy at the University of St Andrews, the seventh academic offer made to him during his eight years in Glasgow. His lectures led some students to devote themselves to missionary effort. Among his pupils were William Lindsay Alexander, Alexander Duff, and James Aitken Wylie. At this period Robert Morrison and Joshua Marshman visited St Andrews.

In November 1828 Chalmers was transferred to the chair of theology at the University of Edinburgh. He then introduced the practice of following the lecture with a examination on what had been delivered. He also introduced text-books.
In 1834 Chalmers was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in the same year he became corresponding member of the Institute of France; in 1835 Oxford conferred on him the degree of DCL. At this time he was living at 3 Forres Street on the Moray Estate in the west end of Edinburgh.

In 1834 he became leader of the evangelical section of the Scottish Church in the General Assembly. He was appointed chairman of a committee for church extension, and in that capacity made a tour through a large part of Scotland, addressing presbyteries and holding public meetings. He also issued numerous appeals, with the result that in 1841, when he resigned his office as convener of the church extension committee, he was able to announce that in seven years upwards of £300,000 had been contributed, and 220 new churches had been built. His efforts to induce the Whig government to assist in this effort were unsuccessful.
In 1840 Chalmers was unsuccessful in applying for the chair of divinity at the University of Glasgow. It went to the Moderate Alexander Hill.

==Non-intrusionism and the Free Church==
Chalmers found himself at the head of the party in the Church of Scotland which stood for &quot;non-intrusionism&quot;: the principle that no minister should be intruded into any parish contrary to the will of the congregation. Cases of conflict between the church and the civil power arose in Auchterarder, Dunkeld and Marnoch. The courts made it clear that the Church, in their opinion, held its temporalities on condition of rendering such obedience as the courts required. The Church then appealed to the government for relief. In political manoeuvres with Westminster politicians, Chalmers was opposed by John Hope.

In January 1843 the government put a final negative on the church&#x27;s claims for spiritual independence. The non-intrusionist movement ended in the Disruption: on 18 May 1843, 470 clergy withdrew from the general assembly and constituted themselves the Free Church of Scotland, with Chalmers as moderator. He had prepared a sustentation fund scheme for the support of the seceding ministers.

In 1844, Chalmers announced a church extension campaign, for new building. In 1846 he became the first principal of the Divinity Hall of the Free Church of Scotland, as it was initially called.

Later in life he was quoted as saying: &quot;Who cares about the Free Church compared with the Christian good of the people of Scotland? Who cares for any Church, but as an instrument of Christian good?&quot;

==Death==
On 28 May 1847 Chalmers returned to his house at Church Hill in Morningside, near Edinburgh, from a journey to London on the subject of national education. On the following day (Saturday) he was employed in preparing a report to the General Assembly of the Free Church, then sitting. On Sunday, the 30th, he continued in his usual health and spirits, and retired to rest with the intention of rising at an early hour to finish his report. The next morning he did not make his appearance, and he was discovered lying dead in bed.

Chalmers was interred in the Grange Cemetery on 4 June, the very first burial in that cemetery. His grave is on the north wall, near the north-west access. A large crowd of persons of all denominations accompanied his remains to the grave. His wife Grace Pratt died 16 January 1850 and is buried with him, as is his daughter Grace Pratt Chalmers (1819–1851) and two of his other six daughters. James Sievewright, the moderator on the year he died, preached a eulogy.

==Works==
Chalmers&#x27;s academic years resulted in a prolific literature of various kinds: his writings fill more than 30 volumes. Contemporaries regarded him highly as a natural theologian. A series of sermons on the relation between the discoveries of astronomy and the Christian revelation was published in January 1817, and within a year nine editions and 20,000 copies were in circulation.

===Political economy===

In 1808 Chalmers published an &quot;Inquiry into the Extent and Stability of National Resources&quot;, a contribution to the discussion created by Bonaparte&#x27;s commercial policy. He argued for a taxation of &quot; the excess of income above that which is laid out in purchasing the necessaries of existence &quot;, and argued that there should be a personal (tax-free) allowance in income taxation. He argued for the necessity of taxation to sustain valid state expenditures, &quot;if taxes were rightly laid, and the produce of them rightly expended, they admit of being most beneficially increased for the best interests of the nation; and with no other sacrifice, than a sacrifice of luxury and splendour on the part of the landed proprietors.&quot;

As a political economist he first dealt with: the relationship between the degree of the fertility of the soil and the social condition of a community; capital accumulation; and the general doctrine of a limit to all the modes by which national wealth may accumulate. He was the first also to advance that argument in favour of religious establishments which met on its own ground the doctrine of Adam Smith, that religion—like other things—should be left to the operation of the law of supply and demand.

In 1826 he published a third volume of &quot;The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns&quot;, a continuation of work begun at St John&#x27;s, Glasgow. In 1832 he published a &quot;Political Economy&quot;, the chief purpose of which was to argue that the right economic condition of the masses is dependent on their right moral condition, so that character is the parent of comfort, not vice versa.

===Poor law reform===
Parochial machinery gave Chalmers experience in dealing with the problem of poor relief. He became an influential thinker on poverty. Chalmers was a Malthusian in his belief that the cause of pauperism was the poor having too many children. He also thought that poor-relief officials should be tenured and business-like; and voluntary taxation was the correct way to support poor relief.

When Chalmers undertook the management of the parish of St John&#x27;s, the poor of the parish cost the city £1400 per annum, and in four years the pauper expenditure was reduced to £280 per annum. The investigation of new applications for relief was given to the deacon of the district, and an effort was made to enable the poor to help themselves. At this time there were few parishes north of the Forth and Clyde where there was a compulsory assessment for the poor, but the English method of assessment was spreading. Chalmers opposed compulsory assessment as counter-productive, and believed that relief should instead be raised and administered by voluntary means. It has been argued that Chalmers was both a paternalist, on the moral plane, and a supporter of economic individualism.

Critics replied to Chalmers that his approach was impossible in large cities. William Pulteney Alison engaged in controversy with him; Chalmers countered with moral arguments. In arguing that private charity should outweigh public expenditure in relieving poverty, he was one of a group of British writers of the period of similar views, that included also Samuel Richard Bosanquet, Thomas Mozley and Frederick Oakeley. The views from Chalmers and Edinburgh had a notable effect in Wales, through Lewis Edwards, &quot;Y Traethodydd&quot;, and Owen Thomas.

===Moralist===

In his St Andrews lectures Chalmers excluded mental philosophy and included the whole sphere of moral obligation, dealing with man&#x27;s duty to God and to his fellow-men in the light of Christian teaching. Many of his lectures were printed in the first and second volumes of his published works.

In the field of ethics he made contributions in regard to the place and functions of volition and attention, the separate and underived character of the moral sentiments, and the distinction between the virtues of perfect and imperfect obligation.

===Religion===
At his own request the article on Christianity was assigned to him in David Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot;. The separate publication of this article, and contributions to the &quot;Edinburgh Christian Instructor&quot; and &quot;The Eclectic Review&quot;, enhanced his reputation as an author.

Chalmers&#x27;s writings are a source for argument and illustration on the question of Establishment. &quot;I have no veneration&quot;, he said to the royal commissioners in St Andrews, before either the voluntary or the non-intrusive controversies had arisen, &quot;for the Church of Scotland &quot;qua&quot; an establishment, but I have the utmost veneration for it &quot;qua&quot; an instrument of Christian good.&quot;

===Natural theology===
Chalmers&#x27; &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot;, in the series &quot;On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God as Manifested in the Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man&quot;, appeared in two volumes 1833 and went through 6 editions. As noted by Robert M. Young, these books effectively represent an encyclopedia of pre-evolutionary natural history, commissioned and published whilst Charles Darwin was on board the .

In the area of natural theology and the Christian evidences he advocated the method of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with the indefinite antiquity of the globe which William Buckland advanced in his &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot;, and which Chalmers had previously communicated to him.

===Gap creationism===
In 1814 Chalmers lectured on the concept of gap creationism, also known as the &quot;gap theory&quot;, and subsequently spread its popularity of this idea which he credited to Episcopius. He wrote of Genesis 1:1: &quot;My own opinion, as published in 1814, is that it forms no part of the first day but refers to a period of indefinite antiquity when God created the worlds out of nothing. The commencement of the first day&#x27;s work I hold to be the moving of God&#x27;s Spirit upon the face of the waters. We can allow geology the amplest time ... without infringing even on the literalities of the Mosaic record.&quot;
This form of old Earth creationism posits that the six-day creation, as described in the Book of Genesis, involved literal 24-hour days, but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and the second verses of Genesis, explaining many scientific observations, including the age of the Earth. Gap creationism differs from day-age creationism (which posits that the &quot;days&quot; of creation were much longer periods - of thousands or millions of years), and from young Earth creationism (which although it agrees concerning the six literal 24-hour days of creation, does not posit any gap of time).

The &quot;New College&quot;, as the Divinity School became known, was a centre of opposition to the &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; (1844). Chalmers himself did not mention the work, but indirectly attacked its view of development in writing for the &quot;North British Review&quot;.

==Family==
Chalmers and his wife, Grace, had six daughters. Chalmers&#x27; eldest daughter Anne married William Hanna, who wrote a long biography of his father-in-law. His second eldest daughter, Elizabeth (Eliza) Mackenzie, travelled to Therapia during the Crimean War to work as a Superintendent of nurses. 

His brother, Charles Chalmers, founded the Merchiston Castle School. Charles&#x27; son, David (Thomas&#x27; nephew) was a noted industrialist and owner of the Cowan &amp; Co. paperworks.

<text>Green Tortoise Adventure Travel is an American long-distance tour bus company founded by Gardner Kent in mid-1973 and based in San Francisco, California. It provides tours in North America, mostly within the United States. It operates a bus line and hostels in Seattle and San Francisco. The company caters particularly to backpackers, both from the U.S. and abroad.

==Early years==
Green Tortoise was one of several low-cost, no-frills alternative bus companies established in the 1970s and based in California and the Pacific Northwest, providing long-distance bus service, but by 1982 it was one of only two still in operation. Also commonly referred to as &quot; bus&quot; companies during the 1970s, for their counterculture vibe and casual atmosphere, the first such company was Grey Rabbit, which started in 1971 and was based in San Francisco. Gardner Kent founded Green Tortoise in 1973 and based its name on that of Grey Rabbit. Although the two companies were very similar, Grey Rabbit put more emphasis on making the journey time shorte.g. San Francisco to New York in less than four dayswhereas Kent planned a service that would be a little slower but more relaxed, with more stops (for swimming, picnics, etc.) and where the experience of the trip itself was more important.

Green Tortoise&#x27;s buses for its first two decades or more were secondhand transit buses built in the 1950s and modified by the removal of nearly all seatsreplaced by a long foam bed in the rear two-thirds of the busand the installation of overhead luggage racks that could be converted into bunk beds. In a 1982 article in &quot;The Sunday Oregonian&quot;, a reporter for the Field News Service wrote that, &quot;The hippie bus companies may have been known for speed but never comfort. Buses were old, overcrowded and prone to breakdowns – frequently stranding their generally hirsute passengers in the often highly unsympathetic hinterlands.&quot; Although the use of old buses continued, Kent made changes targeting the other problems. In 1979, Green Tortoise lengthened its cross-country journey time to seven days and began focusing more on tour bus service than on transportation. It also added trips to Mexico and Alaska.

Green Tortoise, Grey Rabbit and the smaller alternative bus companies all operated informally and without licenses for interstate operation during the 1970s. In 1981, the Tortoise and Rabbit, the only two still operating, both were granted temporary operating permits by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The subsequent passage of the federal Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 eased restrictions on their operation. However, ridership on the alternative buses had been declining ever since the implementation of U.S. airline deregulation in the late 1970s, which had spawned much lower airfares. Grey Rabbit went under in 1983 and was acquired by Green Tortoise. In the early 1980s, the Tortoise&#x27;s fleet still consisted of buses built in the 1950s. In 1983, the company was still operating a regular weekly service from San Francisco to Portland and San Francisco to Los Angeles, along with occasional cross-country trips, in addition to its slower-paced excursions. The company had 14 buses and 50 employees at its peak, in the late 1980s.

==Description and destinations==

The company&#x27;s buses are fitted with bunk beds so that passengers can lounge or sleep while the bus is moving. This is done at night so that a destination can be reached in the morning. The company aims to foster a social environment among its passengers, who work together to cook most meals, which are often vegetarian. There are usually opportunities for camping during a trip. Itineraries typically try to avoid heavily touristed locations, and prioritize places of natural and cultural interest such as national parks, monuments, forests, hot springs, or archaeological ruins.

Green Tortoise has historically made trips to destinations in the United States including Alaska and regular summer coast-to-coast routes from San Francisco to Boston and back. Special trips are also arranged to festivals every year, including a Mardi Gras trip to New Orleans, the Oregon Country Fair and Burning Man, where they also operate a shuttle bus from the event into nearby Gerlach and Empire, Nevada. Trips outside the U.S. have included Mexico (including the Yucatán Peninsula and the Baja California Peninsula), Guatemala, Belize, and Canada. The company discontinued its regularly scheduled service between San Francisco and Seattle via Eugene and Portland in 2001, in favor of focusing on &quot;adventure camping trips&quot;.

In 1992, the company&#x27;s annual revenue was around $1.4 million. It had 50 employees and a fleet of 10 buses at that time, with a bus-renovation garage in Lowell, Oregon. In 2004, the fleet was still mostly made up of 1950s ex-Greyhound buses and 1960s ex-transit buses, but at least one or two new 1990s highway coaches had been added.

==Hostels==

Since the mid-1990s, Green Tortoise has also operated two hostels. The first one opened in Seattle in 1993 and the second in San Francisco in 1994. The Seattle hostel was originally located in the Queen Anne neighborhood, but moved in 1997 to a location on Second Avenue in downtown Seattle, taking over the former Forest Hotel after a year of remodeling. That building was demolished in 2006, and the hostel moved to a different location in downtown Seattle, on Pike Street, across from the Pike Place Market.

According to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, Hostelworld.com named Green Tortoise&#x27;s Seattle hostel one of the top ten hostels in North America in its 2009 annual awards.

<text>Mia Katherine Zapata (August 25, 1965 – July 7, 1993) was an American musician who was the lead singer for the Seattle punk band The Gits. After gaining praise in the emerging grunge scene, Zapata was murdered in 1993 while on her way home from a music venue, at age 27. The crime went unsolved for a decade before her killer, Jesus Mezquia, was arrested in 2003. Mezquia was tried, convicted and sentenced to 36 years in prison.

==Life and career==

Mia Zapata was raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and attended high school at Presentation Academy. Zapata learned how to play the guitar and the piano by age nine, and was influenced by punk rock as well as jazz, blues, and R&amp;B singers such as Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Jimmy Reed, Ray Charles, Hank Williams, and Sam Cooke.

In 1984, Zapata enrolled at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio as a liberal arts student. In September 1986, she and three friends formed the punk rock band The Gits. In 1989, the band relocated to Seattle, Washington. Zapata found a job at a local bar and the four band members moved into an abandoned house they called &quot;The Rathouse.&quot; The band released a series of well-received singles on local independent record labels from 1990 to 1991. As the Gits were making a name for themselves in the local music scene, they often played shows with their friends&#x27; band, 7 Year Bitch. In 1992, the band released its debut album &quot;Frenching the Bully&quot;. Their reputation progressively increased within the grunge scene in Seattle, before the band began work on their second and final album &quot;&quot;, released posthumously in 1994.

Zapata came from an affluent family but often lived without material comforts. As her father described it: &quot;Mia [lived] in two different worlds. She lived on two different sides of the street—the straight side on one, with parochial schools, an affluent family, and tennis clubs. But when she crossed the street, material things didn&#x27;t mean anything to her.&quot; Zapata&#x27;s music often led to a rejection of financial comfort, but regardless of status, Valerie Agnew describes her as &quot;commanding respect and interest immediately&quot;.

Zapata was well connected to her community. Peter Sheehy recalls: &quot;Mia [was] the hub of several social circles; a magnetic personality who drew all sorts of people together who otherwise might never have met.&quot; On his way to her wake in Seattle, Zapata&#x27;s father became lost and recalls many people carrying yellow roses: the admission ticket to her service. Judge Sharon Armstrong, the judge during her killer&#x27;s trial, highlighted Zapata as an &quot;extraordinarily vibrant&quot; woman, who was &quot;obviously talented&quot;; she was &quot;struck by how closely Zapata had connected to so many people&quot;.

==The Gits==

The Gits, who included guitarist Andrew &quot;Joe Spleen&quot; Kessler, drummer Steve Moriarty, and bassist Matt Dresdner, met in Ohio in 1986. A few years later, the band decided to move to Seattle to engage in the city&#x27;s burgeoning music scene. The band quickly developed a following within the local underground punk scene. The band as a whole and Zapata in particular became popular with the Seattle feminist community.

In 1990 the Gits went on a successful international tour without the support of a record label. In 1992, their first independent album, &quot;Frenching the Bully&quot;, was released. The album had hits such as &quot;Another Shot of Whiskey&quot;, &quot;Second Skin&quot;, and &quot;Here&#x27;s to Your Fuck&quot;, receiving positive reviews. The band had planned a large U.S. and European tour as well a series of local shows and was being courted by various labels. Before the band could finish and release their second album, &quot;Enter: The Conquering Chicken&quot;, Zapata was murdered.

After Zapata&#x27;s death, the band continued to make music and found success in their second album with singles such as &quot;Seaweed&quot; and &quot;Precious Blood&quot;.

==Murder and investigation==
Around 2 a.m. on July 7, 1993, Zapata left the Comet Tavern in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. She stayed at a studio space in the basement of an apartment building located a block away, and briefly visited a friend who lived on the second floor. This was the last time Zapata was seen alive. She may have walked a few blocks west, or north to a friend&#x27;s apartment, or may have decided to take the long walk south to her home.

Zapata&#x27;s body was discovered near the intersection of 24th Avenue South and South Washington Street at around 3:30 a.m, located in Seattle&#x27;s Central District. She had been beaten, raped, and strangled. It is believed she encountered her attacker shortly after 2:15 a.m. Her body was not initially identified as she had no identification on her when she was found. An episode of the cable television show &quot;Forensic Files&quot; revealed that she was identified after the medical examiner, who was a fan of the Gits and had been to their concerts, recognized her. According to the medical examiner, if she had not been strangled, she would have died from the internal injuries suffered from the beating. According to court documents, an autopsy found evidence of a struggle in which Zapata suffered blunt impact to her abdomen and a lacerated liver.

Zapata is interred at Cave Hill Cemetery in her hometown of Louisville. The Seattle music community, including some of its most famous bands – Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden – helped raise $70,000 to hire a private investigator for three years. The funds dried up without any major breaks in the case, but the investigator, Leigh Hearon, continued to investigate on her own time. In 1998, after five years of investigation, Seattle police detective Dale Tallman said: &quot;We&#x27;re no closer to solving the case than we were right after the murder.&quot;

==Arrest and trial==
In 2003, Florida fisherman Jesus Mezquia, who had come from Cuba in 1980 in the Mariel boatlift, was arrested and charged in connection with Zapata&#x27;s murder based on DNA evidence. A DNA profile was extracted from saliva found in bite marks on Zapata&#x27;s body and kept in cold storage until the STR technology was developed for full extraction. An original entry in 2001 failed to generate a positive result, but Mezquia&#x27;s DNA entered the national CODIS database after he was arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002.

Mezquia had a history of violence toward women including domestic abuse, burglary, assault, and battery. All of his ex-girlfriends, and his wife, had filed reports against him. There was also a report of indecent exposure on file against him in Seattle within two weeks of Zapata&#x27;s murder. However, there was no known prior link between Mezquia and Zapata.

Mezquia did not testify in his own defense and maintained his innocence. The prosecution theory was that he saw Zapata leave the bar and followed her a short distance before he attacked her. Her headphones covered her ears so she would have been unaware of any danger until he grabbed her and dragged her to his car, where he assaulted her in the back seat. Mezquia was convicted by a jury in 2004 and sentenced to 36 years in prison. In 2005, a state appeals court affirmed his conviction, but reversed his sentence because the judge had exceeded the normal sentencing range without the jury&#x27;s specific approval. Mezquia&#x27;s case was sent back to the trial court for resentencing. However, after Mezquia waived his right to have a jury decide on his sentence, the trial court judge again imposed the same sentence of 36 years, beginning in January 2003. Mezquia died in a Washington hospital on January 21, 2021, at the age of 66.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of Zapata&#x27;s murder, friends created a self-defense group called Home Alive. Home Alive organized benefit concerts and released albums with the participation of many bands, including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Heart, and the Presidents of the United States of America. Joan Jett also recorded an album with the surviving members of the Gits called &quot;Evil Stig&quot; (&quot;Gits Live&quot; backwards). The Home Alive group&#x27;s instructors offered a range of courses, from anger management and use of pepper spray to the martial arts.

In 2005 a documentary film, &quot;The Gits Movie&quot;, was produced about Zapata&#x27;s life, the Gits, and the Seattle music scene. Its first showing occurred at the Seattle International Film Festival in May of that same year. Another version of the film appeared two years later at the 2007 SXSW (South By Southwest) Film Festival. The final cut was released theatrically in over 20 North American cities on July 7, 2008, the 15th memorial anniversary of Zapata&#x27;s death. The following day the film was released on DVD along with a &quot;Best of the Gits&quot; CD (both from Liberation Entertainment).

&quot;¡Viva Zapata!&quot;, by punk band 7 Year Bitch, was released in June 1994, on C/Z Records in Seattle, as a tribute to Zapata. Some of the songs on the album address the issue of Zapata&#x27;s murder directly. Following her death, Jett and Kathleen Hanna wrote a song called &quot;Go Home&quot; that was later released on Jett&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Pure and Simple&quot;. Later, a video for &quot;Go Home&quot; was released which depicts a woman who is being stalked and attacked but is then able to defend herself against the assailant.

In February 2013, a play called &quot;These Streets&quot;, inspired by the stories of and featuring music by Zapata and other female musicians in Seattle, debuted at the ACT Theatre in Seattle.

Zapata&#x27;s death caused a sense of defeat and fear within the Seattle community. The &quot;Seattle Times&quot; marked the murder as the moment &quot;the Seattle scene lost its sense of invincibility.&quot; Cristen Storm recalls Zapata&#x27;s death as a reality check, stating: &quot;[They were] all very tough people and as a group of women, [they] are all really strong, outspoken, and hard-hitting, very opinionated women and that perception of, &#x27;We&#x27;re not victims at all in any way and this can&#x27;t happen to women that aren&#x27;t victims,&#x27; and I think [Zapata&#x27;s death] shattered that myth for us, [and showed] that it happens to all types of women.&quot;

Zapata is often cast as a symbol for feminist activism, a martyr, and an angel. Dresdner said &quot;[Mia] was sainted, and that was very peculiar... she became this icon for feminism and all kinds of things that she had very little to do with in her actual life.&quot; Margaret O&#x27;Neil Girouard, who wrote her thesis on Zapata, believes she is an example of female artists being classified based on the perceived motivations behind their art. Moriarty wrote that &quot;[Mia wanted] to relate to people on a personal level in her lyrics [rather] than on a political level.&quot; It has been speculated that this association may be due to her presence as a &quot;charismatic female musician&quot; in the Northwest, who was performing throughout the emergence of the riot grrrl movement.

==In popular culture==
Zapata&#x27;s murder was the subject of the episode &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; of the television series &quot;Forensic Files&quot;. It was also featured in episode 9 of the eighth season of Unsolved Mysteries.

<text>Charles Julius Bertram (1723–1765) was an English expatriate in Denmark who &quot;discovered&quot;—and presumably wrote—&quot;The Description of Britain&quot; (), an 18th-century literary forgery purporting to be a mediaeval work on history that remained undetected for over a century. In that time, it was highly influential for the reconstruction of the history of Roman Britain and contemporary Scotland, to the extent of appearing in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; and being used to direct William Roy&#x27;s initial Ordnance Survey maps. Bertram &quot;discovered&quot; the manuscript around the age of 24 and spent the rest of his life a successful academic and author. Scholars contested various aspects of the &quot;Description&quot;, but it was not recognized as unquestionably a forgery until 1846.

==Early life==
Charles Bertram was born in London in 1723. He was the son of an English silk dyer who was usually accounted to have emigrated to Copenhagen, Denmark, among the retinue of Princess Louisa, a daughter of George II, upon her marriage to Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1743. (The prince became King Frederick V three years later.) Other sources suggest the father immigrated earlier, in 1738. The father established himself as a hosier in 1744, and Charles seems to have benefited from the warm reception that Louisa and her retinue received from the Danes. On 5 July 1747, Charles petitioned the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Consortium for admission to study history, antiquities, philosophy, and mathematics. This seems to have been granted, although students were generally required to adhere to the Danish Church and Bertram remained Anglican. He became a friend and protégé of Hans Gram, the royal librarian and a member of the privy council. On 23 March 1748, Bertram petitioned the king to be permitted to give public lectures on the English language and became a teacher of English in the Royal Marine Academy in Copenhagen. (Some accounts name him as a professor, rather than a tutor; if so, that status would have been granted some years later, as he was a new undergraduate in 1747.) His 1749 chrestomathy &quot;An Essay on the Excellency and Style of the English Tongue&quot; has been called the initiation of English-language printing in Denmark. A brother apparently died at sea in 1752, and at some point he married Cathrine Marie Gold.

==&quot;The Description of Britain&quot;==

In 1746, Bertram composed a letter to the English antiquarian William Stukeley on Gram&#x27;s recommendation. He hesitated sending it and Stukeley did not receive it until 11 June 1747. He found it &quot;full of compliments, as usual with foreigners&quot;, and his reply brought a &quot;prolix and elaborate Latin epistle&quot; from Gram in Bertram&#x27;s favour. Gram was widely known and respected in English universities. After a few further letters, Bertram mentioned &quot;a manuscript in a friend&#x27;s hands of Richard of Westminster, ... a history of Roman  ... and an antient map of the island annex&#x27;d.&quot; He eventually &quot;confessed&quot; that another Englishman, &quot;wild in his youth, had stolen it out of a larger manuscript in an English Library&quot;, permitting its use to Bertram upon his promise of secrecy. Stukeley was considering retirement but, receiving a new position in London and hearing of Gram&#x27;s death, he renewed the correspondence and received a &quot;copy&quot; of its script made by Bertram. David Casley, the keeper of the Cotton Library, &quot;immediately&quot; described it as around 400 years old. Stukeley thereafter always treated Bertram as reliable. He &quot;press&#x27;d Mr Bertram to get the manuscript into his hands, if possible ... as the greatest treasure we now can boast of in this kind of learning.&quot; Bertram refused his attempts to purchase the original manuscript for the British Museum, but Stukeley had received copies of the text piecemeal over a series of letters and had a version of the map by early 1750. Beale Poste noted that the volume appeared in no manuscript catalogues of the era but offered that it could have been stolen at the time of the Cotton Library&#x27;s fire in 1732. There had been a monk named Richard at Westminster Abbey in the mid-15th century and Bertram suggested this date to Stukeley. Stukeley preferred instead to identify Bertram&#x27;s &quot;Richard of Westminster&quot; with Richard of Cirencester, who had lived at Westminster in the late 14th century and was known to have compiled another history. Stukeley made the text and map available at the Arundel Library of the Royal Society.

Stukeley examined the text for years before reading his analysis of the work and its itineraries before the Society of Antiquaries in 1756 and publishing its itineraries in 1757. He was excited that the text provided &quot;more than a hundred names of cities, roads, people, and the like: which till now were absolutely unknown to us&quot; and found it written &quot;with great judgment, perspicuity, and conciseness, as by one that was altogether master of his subject&quot;. His account of the itineraries included a new engraving, reorienting Bertram&#x27;s map to place north at the top. Later in 1757, at Stukeley&#x27;s urging, Bertram published the full text in a volume alongside Gildas&#x27;s &quot;Ruin of Britain&quot;, and the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; traditionally ascribed to Nennius. Bertram&#x27;s preface noted that the work &quot;contains many fragments of a better time, which would now in vain be sought for elsewhere&quot;. The preface goes on to note that, &quot;considered by Dr. Stukeley ... a jewel ... worthy to be rescued from destruction&quot;, Bertram printed it &quot;from respect for him&quot;. This volume&#x27;s map was the earlier one and Stukeley later employed it for his own published posthumously in 1776.

The work was studied critically and various aspects of pseudo-Richard&#x27;s text were universally rejected, including his claimed province of Vespasiana in lowland Scotland. Edward Gibbon considered pseudo-Richard to be &quot;feeble evidence&quot; and John Pinkerton tersely noted that, where the two differ, &quot;Ptolemy must be right and Richard must be wrong.&quot; Nonetheless, the legitimacy of the text itself was unquestioned for decades despite no actual manuscript ever being seen by another person. Instead, Bertram always provided credible reasons why the actual document could not be made available and provided copies to satisfy each new request for information.

==Later life==
Stukeley assisted Bertram in joining the Society of Antiquaries in 1756. Bertram was succeeded as the naval academy&#x27;s English teacher by the Swedish Carl Mannercrantz. The terminology and accent system he employed in his works, despite claims to originality, seem to broadly mimic Jens Høysgaard&#x27;s and Bertram passed unmentioned by the &quot;Danish Biographical Dictionary&quot;. His &quot;Royal English–Danish Grammar&quot; was undeserving of its appellation and was published, like all his books, at his own expense; nonetheless, it has been noted as &quot;far and away the longest, the most ambitious, and the best&quot; such work in its time. The end of its third volume consisted of blurbs and testimonials, including praise from the German Anglicist Theodor Arnold. Bertram died a respected scholar at Copenhagen on 8 January 1765.

==Legacy==
The success of the forgery was partially due to the difficulty in finding Bertram&#x27;s original text, which had a limited printing in Copenhagen. British scholars generally relied on Stukeley&#x27;s translation, which obscured some of the questionable aspects of the text, until a new volume with the original text and a full translation was published anonymously by Henry Hatcher in 1809. By Hatcher&#x27;s time, it had become impossible to purchase a copy in London or Copenhagen, and his own edition was produced through the loan of William Coxe&#x27;s copy. Bertram&#x27;s letters to Stukeley were acquired by John Britton and studied by Joseph Hunter.

The inability to find a manuscript in Copenhagen after Bertram&#x27;s death provoked some questions as to its validity. In 1827, John Hodgson fully rejected the text as spurious on account of its absence from Bertram&#x27;s papers in Copenhagen, errors in the &quot;extracts palaeography, and the work&#x27;s highly unusual Latin style. Enough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the English Historical Society declined to include &quot;The Description of Britain&quot; in its list of important historical works. In 1846, the German scholar Karl Wex conclusively proved at least some passages of the &quot;Description&quot; were completely spurious. He had been working on a new edition of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Agricola&quot; and, consulting the &quot;Description&quot;, he recognized that it included transcription errors which had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by Venetian printers in the late 15th century. His work was translated into English by Beale Poste and printed by the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in October 1846.

Many British scholars were slow to accept the truth. Some of the routes mentioned by the work had seemed to have been subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of &quot;The Description of Britain&quot; came out in the following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defence of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before William Camden. The final confirmation that the &quot;Description&quot; was spurious came in the 1860s. Over four articles in 1866 and 1867, Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward thoroughly debunked the work and, in 1869, J. E. B. Mayor complemented this by thoroughly comparing the &quot;Description&quot; with the &quot;Historial Mirror&quot; written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work), which he had been reviewing and editing for the Rolls Series. Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Edward Gibbon, William Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.

<text>The Wren Library is the library of Trinity College in Cambridge. It was designed by Christopher Wren in 1676 and completed in 1695.

==Description==
The library is a single large room built over an open colonnade on the ground floor of Nevile&#x27;s Court. The floor of the library proper within the upper storey lies several feet below the external division between the two storeys, reconciling the demands of use with the harmony of architectural proportion. It is credited as being one of the first libraries to be built with large windows to give comfortable light levels to aid readers.

The book stacks are arranged in rows perpendicular to the walls under the intervals between the windows. At the end of each stack is a fine limewood carving by Grinling Gibbons, and above these are plaster cast busts of notable writers through the ages. Other marble busts standing on plinths depict notable members of the college and are mostly carved by Louis-François Roubiliac. A later addition is a full size statue of Lord Byron carved by Bertel Thorvaldsen, originally offered to Westminster Abbey for inclusion in Poets&#x27; Corner, but refused due to the poet&#x27;s reputation for immorality.

Giovanni Battista Cipriani was commissioned to design the stained-glass window at the south end, and William Peckitt completed it in 1775. The × window shows Fame or the muse of the college in yellow robes presenting Isaac Newton to King George III, seated by an allegory of Britannia, while Francis Bacon records the proceedings, and two cherubim and a bare-breasted woman with a trumpet herald the occasion. Considered a distraction to the scholars, thick curtains covered the window in the 19th century.

On the east balustrade of the library&#x27;s roof are four statues by Gabriel Cibber representing Divinity, Law, Physic (medicine), and Mathematics.

As part of the complex of buildings surrounding Nevile&#x27;s Court, Great Court and New Court, the library is a Grade I listed building.

The other library designed by Wren is Lincoln Cathedral Library.

==Notable books==
The library contains many notable rare books and manuscripts, many bequeathed by past members of the college.

Included in the collection are
*Isaac Newton&#x27;s first edition copy of &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; with handwritten notes for the second edition.
*Isaac Newton&#x27;s (1659–61) Notebook 
*An eighth-century copy of the Epistles of St Paul
*About 1250 medieval manuscripts including the great 12th-century Eadwine Psalter from Christ Church, Canterbury, the 13th-century Anglo-Norman Trinity Apocalypse and the 15th-century Trinity Carol Roll.
*A. A. Milne&#x27;s manuscript of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;.
*The Capell collection of early Shakespeare editions
*A collection of autograph poems by John Milton
*A 14th-century manuscript of &quot;The Vision of Piers Plowman&quot;
*Several works printed by William Caxton, including the first book printed in English and the first dated printed book produced in England
*Several notebooks written by Ludwig Wittgenstein
*Handwritten notes by Robert Oppenheimer describing the &quot;Trinity&quot; atomic bomb test in New Mexico, U.S.
*Ramanujan&#x27;s &quot;lost notebook&quot;
*1620 edition of William Morgan&#x27;s translation of the bible into Welsh

==Digitisation programme==
In early 2014 the library began a major programme of digitisation. To date, over 1100 of the 1250 medieval manuscripts owned by the college have been digitised and are freely available to read online.
A link to the list of digitised manuscripts can be found in the external links below.

==Visiting==
The library is open to the public, but opening times are limited. There is no admission charge for the Wren Library.

<text>Louis Blanchette (11 July 1739August 1793) was a French Canadian explorer and likely fur trader in North America in the 18th century. He explored areas of what is now Missouri, and is notable as the founder of the city of St. Charles on the Missouri River in 1769.

==Background==
According to &quot;Hopewell&#x27;s Legends of the Missouri and Mississippi&quot; (1874):

:In the year 1765, a French Canadian, called Blanchette Chasseur, animated by that love of adventure which characterizes all who have lived a roving and restless life, ascended the Missouri, with a few followers, for the purpose of forming a settlement in the then remote wilderness.

:He was one of those who encountered perils and endured privations, not from necessity, but from choice; for he had been born to affluence, and had every indulgence consistent with wealth and station, but from a boy had spurned, with Spartan prejudice, every effeminate trait, and had accomplished himself in every hardy and manly exercise. When he had attained his majority, he sailed for America, then the El Dorado of all the visionary, roving and restless spirits of the age.

According to Hopewell&#x27;s account, Blanchette met another Frenchman (Bernard Guillet) in 1765 at the future site of St. Charles. Blanchette, determined to settle there, asked if Guillet, who had become the chief of a Dakota band, had chosen a name for it.

:&quot;I called the place &#x27;Les Petites Côtes&#x27; &quot; replied Bernard, &quot;from the sides of the hills that you see.&quot;

:&quot;By that name shall it be called,&quot; said Blanchette Chasseur, &quot;for it is the echo of nature -- beautiful from its simplicity.&quot;

Hopewell&#x27;s account is suspect on several details. For one, he appears to have conflated Blanchette&#x27;s trade as a hunter (&quot;chasseur&quot; in French) with a surname.

Blanchette settled there in 1769 under the authority of the Spanish governor of Upper Louisiana, and served as its civil and military leader until his death in 1793. During this time perhaps only a couple dozen buildings were built. Although the settlement was under Spanish jurisdiction, the settlers themselves remained primarily French nationals. He is buried in St. Charles Borromeo cemetery, St. Charles, Missouri.

<doc id="554515" wikidata="Q3376555" url="?curid=554515" title="Peter Easton">
<text>Peter Easton ( – 1620 or after) was an English privateer and later pirate in the early 17th century. Conflicting accounts exist regarding his early life. By 1602, Easton had become a highly successful privateer, commissioned to protect English interests in Newfoundland. The &#x27;most famous English pirate of the day&#x27;, his piracies ranged from Ireland and Guinea to Newfoundland. He is best known today for his involvement in the early English settlement of Newfoundland, including the settlements at Harbour Grace and Ferryland from 1611 to 1614. One of the most successful of all pirates, he controlled such seapower that no sovereign or state could afford to ignore him, and he was never overtaken or captured by any fleet commissioned to hunt him down. However, he is not as well known as some of the pirates from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

==Loyal service==
Peter Easton, who was also known by Eston, had been a loyal servant of the English Crown. His ancestors had served in the Crusades. The Eastons also distinguished themselves against the Spanish Armada.

The Historic Rose Manor based in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland and Labrador, is in close proximity to the fort that once housed Peter and his crew .

In 1602, Easton was in command of a convoy as a privateer with a commission from Elizabeth I of England to protect the Newfoundland fishing fleet. During these times, fishing vessels would carry arms and small cannons to protect the valuable cargo of fish from pirates and foreign vessels. Under his commission, he could legally press-gang local fishermen into service for him. He could also attack the ships and wharves of the enemy as much as he wished, especially the much hated Spanish. Easton&#x27;s flagship was &quot;Happy Adventure&quot; from which he flew the Saint George&#x27;s Cross at the masthead.

==Becoming a pirate==
On 23 June 1604, after Elizabeth I was succeeded by James I, the king sued for peace with Spain and canceled all letters of commission to privateers. On hearing the news, Easton continued his attack on vessels as though nothing had changed. In so doing, he had crossed the line into piracy.

In his flagship, &quot;Happy Adventure&quot;, Easton flew the St. George’s Cross and attacked Spanish ships for gold in the West Indies and the Mediterranean Sea, while in the meantime demanding and receiving protection money from English ships. In 1610, he blockaded the Bristol Channel, effectively controlling the shipping entering and leaving the western English ports. For the most part, he was acting on behalf of the powerful family of the Killigrews from Falmouth, Cornwall. They financed his expeditions and also took shares in his profits.

Easton arrived in the Newfoundland Colony in 1612 with ten pirate ships and had his headquarters at Harbour Grace. He raided and plundered both English and foreign vessels and the harbours of Newfoundland, press-ganging fishermen into his service along the way.

On one expedition, he plundered thirty ships in St. John&#x27;s and held Sir Richard Whitbourne prisoner, releasing him on the condition that Whitbourne would go to England and obtain a pardon for Easton. The pardon was granted, but by this time, Easton had moved on to the Barbary Coast to harass the Spanish.

While in Newfoundland, Easton is estimated to have taken as many as 1,500 fishermen for his ships, most voluntarily. Easton continued to protect John Guy&#x27;s colony at Cuper&#x27;s Cove but did not allow him to establish another colony at Renews.

On one of his raids, Easton headed for the Azores. Stationing his fleet south and west of the islands, he planned to intercept the Spanish silver fleet. No details of the battle are known except that a few days later, Easton arrived in Tunis loaded with treasure and four Spanish ships in tow.

==Retirement to Savoy==

Early in 1613 the Duke of Savoy issued a proclamation making Nice and Villefranche free ports and offering asylum and safe conducts to all pirates. On 20 February 1613 Easton sailed into Villefranche at the head of four ships and 900 soldiers, leaving eight more vessels outside the Strait of Gibraltar. Easton met with the duke and agreed to invest 100,000 crowns in Savoy, offering to the duke a percentage of the proceeds in return for an annual income. William Parkhurst, an English agent in Savoy, wrote of him:

&quot;This Easton hath since beene with me: hee seemeth to have the age of 40 yeares: his countenance is rude and savadge (which the Duke tooke notice off), his speech and carriage is slow, subtile, and guilty...&quot;

Easton ingratiated himself with the Duke of Savoy by taking part in a raid on the Duchy of Mantua. Easton was granted a pension of £4000 a year and was sworn to faithful service, becoming a Catholic, marrying an heiress and being created a Marquis of the Duchy of Savoy. Despite this, he remained known at court as &#x27;Il cosaro Inglese&#x27; (the English corsair).

Within a month of Easton&#x27;s arrival in Savoy he had dismissed most of his company. Although he took part in a Savoyard naval attack on Venice later in 1613, he commanded French crews and ships. The expedition was not successful and after this Easton took little part in maritime affairs. Nevertheless, he remained in the Duke&#x27;s employ till at least 1620.

<doc id="554516" wikidata="Q617239" url="?curid=554516" title="Cutting board">
<text>A cutting board (or chopping board) is a durable board on which to place material for cutting. The kitchen cutting board is commonly used in preparing food; other types exist for cutting raw materials such as leather or plastic. Kitchen cutting boards are often made of wood or plastic and come in various widths and sizes. There are also cutting boards made of glass, steel, or marble, which are easier to clean than wooden or plastic ones such as nylon or Corian, but tend to damage knives due to their hardness. Rough cutting edges—such as serrated knives—abrade and damage a cutting surface more rapidly than do smooth cutting implements.

== History ==
Early cutting boards dated as far back to early 3000 BC. Cutting board are and have been widely used. They could be seen in ancient Egypt and Greek and Roman kitchens. Early cutting boards were flat stones or large wooden slabs, likely emerging out of necessity. Wood soon became a preferred material for its durability and availability. With the advancement of technology and materials, plastic cutting boards soon gained popularity due to its lightness, and its low maintenance qualities.

==Materials ==
A knife edge is a delicate structure and can easily be blunted by a too abrasive surface. It can also be chipped if used on a surface that is too hard. A good cutting board material must be soft, easy to clean, and non-abrasive, but not fragile to the point of being destroyed. Hard cutting boards can, however, be used for food preparation tasks that do not require a sharp knife, like cutting cheese or making sandwiches.

===Wood===
Wood has some advantages over plastic in that it is somewhat self-healing; shallow cuts in the wood will close up on their own. Wood also has natural anti-septic properties.

Hardwoods with tightly grained wood and small pores are best for wooden cutting boards. Good hardness and tight grain help reduce scoring of the cutting surface and absorption of liquid and dirt into the surface. Red oak, though a hardwood, has large pores which retain dirt even after washing. This makes it a poor choice for cutting-board material. Some ideal woods for cutting boards are birch wood, maple wood, cherry wood, and walnut wood. It is recommended to look for cutting boards made from a single piece of wood, opposed to multiple glued pieces. Cutting boards made from multiple glued pieces are more widely available, but it is important to make sure the glue used is free from formaldehyde and melamine. 

Teak&#x27;s tight grains and natural coloration make it a highly attractive cutting-board material, both for aesthetic and durability purposes. Teak, a tropical wood, contains tectoquinone, a component of natural oily resins that repel moisture, fungi, warping, rot and microbes. Wooden boards can also be refinished with sanding and a reapplication of oil and wax. Cutting boards with non-toxic natural waxes and oil coatings, such as linseed oil and beeswax are the most ideal.Wood boards need to be cared for with an &quot;edible&quot; mineral oil to avoid warping, and should not be left in puddles of liquid. Ideally, they should be suspended freely while drying. Care must be taken when selecting wood, especially tropical hardwood, for use as a cutting board, as some species contain toxins or allergens.

=== Bamboo ===
Bamboo cutting boards are an alternative to plastic or glass cutting boards, partially because bamboo is commonly thought to be naturally antimicrobial (although studies show otherwise). During the harvesting process, bamboo is carefully chosen for maturation, markings, and size. The stalk is then cut into specific sizes and sent through a pressing process that strips the stalks into smaller plank-like pieces. Once the bamboo is pliable, a cutting board can be produced from multiple pieces by lamination. Bamboo has not been used historically in Asian nations due to its extreme hardness. Bamboo is less porous yet harder than hardwood cutting boards. Because of its hardness, it is resistant to scarring from knives. Furthermore, it absorbs little moisture and therefore is more resistant to bacteria than other woods.

===Plastic===

Plastic boards are usually called PE (polyethylene) cutting boards, or HDPE (high-density polyethylene plastic), the material from which these boards are made. There are essentially two types of HDPE boards being made. One version is made from injection-molded plastic, while the other is HDPE from an extrusion line. Furthermore, researchers are now developing a cutting board made from HDPE plastic waste as a more environmentally friendly option. These cutting boards use calcium carbonate for filler, and glass fiber as reinforcement. 

There are several certifications of plastic cutting boards, one being NSF, that certifies the plastic has passed requirements to come in contact with food. Unlike wood, plastic has no inherent antiseptic properties. However, unlike wood, plastic boards do allow rinsing with harsher cleaning chemicals such as bleach and other disinfectants without damage to the board or retention of the chemicals to later contaminate food. 

Most HDPE boards are specifically designed to not dull the edge of a knife. If a score line is present, the knife is safe. A serrated knife should not be used on a plastic cutting board. The sharper the knife, the longer the cutting board will last. Semi-disposable thin flexible cutting boards also ease transferring their contents to a cooking or storage vessel.

===Silicone===
Like rubber, silicone is soft on the blade, while being just as self-healing and anti-bacterial as wood. Silicone is also heat-resistant, and lacks the rubbery smell of rubber boards.

===Glass===
While glass looks like an easy surface to keep clean, glass cutting boards can damage knives because of the high hardness of the material. Cutting on glass tends to dent, roll or even chip knife edges in a rapid manner. Additionally, if used for chopping instead of slicing, glass can shatter or chip itself, contaminating food.

===Steel===
Steel shares with glass the advantages of the durability and ease of cleaning, as well as the tendency to damage knives. Depending on the exact steel and heat treatment used, at best a steel cutting board will wear the edge on knives quickly; at worst chip, dent, or roll it like glass.

==Hygiene==
Sanitation with cutting boards is a delicate process because bacteria can reside in grooves produced by cutting, or in liquids left on the board. Harmful bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, and Staphylococcus can easily reside on a cutting board without proper care. Proper maintenance of a cutting board is essential to sustaining a safe cooking environment and preventing food borne illnesses. 

===Preventing cross contamination of food===
Bacteria or allergens can easily be transmitted from one part of the kitchen to another or from one food to another via knives, hands, or surfaces such as chopping boards. To reduce the chance of this, it is advised to thoroughly wash and sanitize each cutting board after using it, and to use separate boards for different types of food such as raw meat, cooked meat, dairy and vegetables. It is recommended that plastic cutting boards be used for raw meat. This is because plastic cutting boards are non-porous and are less likely to harbor bacteria from raw meat. Many professional kitchens follow this standard colour-coding system:
* Blue cutting boards: raw seafood.
* Red cutting boards: raw red meat.
* Green cutting boards: vegetables and fruits.
* Yellow cutting boards: poultry
* Brown cutting boards: cooked meat
* White cutting boards: dairy and breads (also for universal if no other board is available.)

===Care of boards===
Regardless of the material, regular maintenance of a cutting board is important. A very diluted bleach solution is best for disinfecting cutting boards. The recommended amount is 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water. To remove odors, the board can be rinsed and then rubbed with coarse salt and left to stand for several minutes before being wiped and rinsed clean. In a wooden board, this procedure will also smooth out minor imperfections on the surface. All cutting boards should eventually be replaced overtime when they are excessively worn, or have hard-to-clean groves.

====Wooden boards====
Wooden boards should never be placed in the dishwasher, or left immersed for long periods, as the wood or glue may be affected, or mildew may develop. To prevent cracking, wood cutting boards should be treated monthly, under normal usage. A standard recommendation is 5–7 times a year, or as needed. A light food-grade mineral oil is a good preservative for wooden cutting boards, as it helps keep water from seeping into the grain. Alternatively, one may also use a food-grade drying oil such as poppyseed oil, tung oil or linseed oil. The first two dry much faster than linseed. Note, plant based oils will go rancid, and cause wood cutting boards to pick up unpleasant smells. If the board does pick up any smells from food, there are a few ways to remove odors. One way being a combination of lemon juice and kosher salt, and another being a solution of 1:3 distilled white vinegar and water. For the lemon and salt combo, sprinkle salt over the board before squeezing lemon juice over the salt and rubbing the mixture over the board before letting it completely dry and scraping the dried paste off. On the other hand, a simple spray and wipe of the white vinegar and water solution removes any lasting odors.

Most commercially available linseed and tung oils are not “food grade”, as they contain metallic driers. In general, edible savory vegetable or olive oils are not recommended because they tend to go rancid, causing the board to smell and food to pick up the rancid taste. When heavily or deeply scored, wooden boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour bacteria. Boards can be easily resurfaced with various woodworking tools, such as scrapers or planes, even sandpaper.

====Plastic boards====
Unlike wood, most plastic boards are non-porous, which means that bacteria cannot enter below the surface. It is still equally as important to clean the boards thoroughly after each use as bacteria can lie and grow in any imperfections on the surface. Although many boards are dishwasher safe, both domestic and professional boards which are HDPE will be by the hot water, making them unsafe. When heavily or deeply scored, boards need to be resurfaced as deep scoring can harbor mildew and bacteria. However, resurfacing a plastic cutting board is quite difficult and replacing it is recommended instead.

=== Bacterial contamination ===
A 1994 study found that wood was more likely to retain bacterial contamination, while another 1994 study found the opposite. Studies in 2002 and 2005 observed that bacterial populations declined faster on oak and pine than on plastic and other woods.

Another study in 2012 found that bamboo had high antimicrobial activity compared to wood.

In 2016, a literature review summarizing wood and microbial safety was published.

A 2020 study concluded that wood has antimicrobial properties as bacterial stains survived less time on wood surfaces compared to other materials which are stainless steel, polycarbonate, and aluminum.

<doc id="554518" wikidata="Q159900" url="?curid=554518" title=".htaccess">
<text>An .htaccess (&quot;hypertext access&quot;) file is a directory-level configuration file supported by several web servers, used for configuration of website-access issues, such as URL redirection, URL shortening, access control (for different web pages and files), and more. The &#x27;dot&#x27; (period or full stop) before the file name makes it a hidden file in Unix-based environments.

A site could have more than one .htaccess file, and the files are placed inside the web tree (i.e. inside directories and their sub-directories), and hence their other name &quot;distributed configuration files&quot;.

.htaccess files act as a subset of the server&#x27;s global configuration file (like httpd.conf) for the directory that they are in, or all sub-directories.

The original purpose of .htaccess—reflected in its name—was to allow per-directory access control by, for example, requiring a password to access World Wide Web content. More commonly, however, the .htaccess files define or override many other configuration settings such as content type, character set, Common Gateway Interface handlers, etc.

==Format and language==
.htaccess files are written in the Apache Directives variant of the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) language. Learning basic PCRE itself can help in mastering work with these files.

For historical reasons, the format of .htaccess files is a limited subset of the Apache HTTP server&#x27;s global configuration file httpd.conf even when used with web servers such as Oracle iPlanet Web Server and Zeus Web Server which have very different native global configuration files.

==Common usage==
; Authorization, authentication: A .htaccess file is often used to specify security restrictions for a directory, hence the filename &quot;access&quot;. The .htaccess file is often accompanied by a .htpasswd file which stores valid usernames and their passwords.
; URL rewriting: Servers often use .htaccess for rewriting long, overly comprehensive URLs to shorter and more memorable ones.
; Blocking (access control): Use &quot;allow/deny&quot; to block users by IP address or domain. Also used to block bad bots, rippers and referrers.
; SSI: Enable server-side includes.
; Directory listing: Control how the server will react when no specific web page is specified.
; Customized error responses: Changing the page that is shown when a server-side error occurs, for example HTTP 404 Not Found or, to indicate to a search engine that a page has moved, HTTP 301 Moved Permanently.
; MIME types: Instruct the server how to treat different varying file types.
; Cache control: .htaccess files allow a server to control caching by web browsers and proxies to speed up websites, reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. .htaccess also adds the cache age to the webpage resources so that on revisiting the page, the elements are reloaded from browser cache till the age mentioned expires, instead of requesting the resource again from the server.
; HTTPS &amp; HSTS: Implementation of both HTTPS and HSTS on Apache servers is largely dependent on correct URL rewriting &amp; header information mentioned in .htaccess file. Any incorrect syntax in the file while deploying HTTPS or HSTS leads to a failure in implementation.

==Advantages==
; Immediate changes: Because .htaccess files are read on every request, changes made in these files take immediate effect – as opposed to the main configuration file, which requires the server to be restarted for the new settings to take effect.
; Non-privileged users: For servers with multiple users, such as on shared web hosting, it is often desirable to allow individual users the ability to alter their site configuration. The use of .htaccess files allows such individualization, and by unprivileged users – because the main server configuration files do not need to be changed.

==Disadvantages==
Controlling Apache using the main server configuration file httpd.conf is often preferred for security and performance reasons:
; Performance loss: For each HTTP request, there are additional file-system accesses for parent directories when using .htaccess, to check for possibly existing .htaccess files in those parent directories which are allowed to hold .htaccess files. It is possible to programmatically migrate directives from .htaccess to httpd.conf if this performance loss is a concern.
; Security: Allowing individual users to modify the configuration of a server can cause security concerns if not set up properly.
; Syntax: .htaccess is usually very sensitive to syntax errors. Due to this any misspellings may lead to server errors and web resources in the directory with the erroneous .htaccess not being displayed at all.

==In popular culture==

Portions of the 2020 video game &quot;Mackerelmedia Fish&quot;, which explores themes of Internet culture, have been implemented directly on a website&#x27;s open .htaccess directories.

<text>A dating agency, also known as a marriage bureau, marriage agency, matrimonial bureau or matrimonial agency, is a business that provides matchmaking services to potential couples, with a view toward romance and/or marriage between them.

==Variations==

*Face-to-face: Men and women come in person and ask a matchmaker to help them find a potential partner. 
*Internet dating agency: A website where people register, post their profiles and contact other members who have signed up with the agency.
*Speed dating: A group of people rotate partners and describe their personality and desires within a set time limit.
*Marriage agency: An agency that specifically helps people find a marriage partner, rather than someone to date on a casual or serious basis. These can be domestic or international.

The internet and speed dating agencies are the biggest of the group.

There is a rise of businesses that teach men how they can meet women themselves without the use of a dating agency, some of which use the label pickup artist.

Both dating agencies and marriage agencies have some organizations where people are paid to interact with other members and keep their interests high. Various agencies only have members who are genuinely seeking real partners.

==History and trends==

===18th and 19th century marriage agencies===
Marriage agencies run by clergymen were introduced to England and Wales in the late 18th century, prompting considerable amusement from the social commentators of the day. In 1799 a &quot;provincial publication says that a MATRIMONIAL PLAN is proposed to be established throughout every county, city, or town, in England or Wales. (...) The system of this curious, and it should seem &quot;serious&quot;, plan — as far as we can learn — is as follows: — Every person, of either sex, who desires to enter into a treaty of marriage, &quot;is first to subscribe a certain sum.&quot; All ladies and gentlemen to describe themselves, by real or fictitious names, as they may choose&quot;.

Men and women would classify themselves into three classes, and would generally state how much money they earned, or would be given as a dowry. A typical entry would read:

Second Class, No.2. — A gentleman, 40 years of age, a little corpulent, rather of a dark brown complexion, wears a wig, has a place in the Customs, and a small estate in Suffolk, with 750&quot;l&quot;. in the funds; reasonably well-tempered, and at times very lively; religion — of his fathers.

By 1825 an agency in Bishopsgate, London, opened three days a week for members of the public looking for a partner to describe themselves and subscribe to the appropriate list. However, by then both ladies and gentlemen had to classify themselves into 5 different classes.

===Since World War II===

Though most people meet their dates at social organizations, in their daily life and work, or are introduced through friends or relatives, commercial dating agencies emerged strongly, but discreetly, in the Western world after World War II, mostly catering to the 25–44 age group. Newspaper and magazine personal ads also became common.

Since the emergence of the Internet, mate-finding and courtship have seen changes due to online dating services and mobile dating services. Telecommunications and computer technologies have developed rapidly since around 1995, allowing daters the use of home telephones with answering machines – mobile phones – and web-based systems to find prospective partners. &quot;Pre-dates&quot; can take place by telephone or online via instant messaging, e-mail, or even video communication.

Many singles look for love on the Web, and research in the United Kingdom suggests that as of 2004 there were around 150 agencies in that country, where the market was apparently growing at around 20 percent a year. Academic researchers find it impossible to find precise figures about crucial statistics, such as the ratio of active daters to a large number of inactive members (whom an agency will often wrongly claim as potential partners, leaving them &#x27;on the books&#x27; long after they have left) and the overall ratio of men to women in an agency&#x27;s membership. Academic research on traditional pre-Internet agencies suggests that most such agencies had far more men than women in their membership. Due to the ratio of available single women being biased against men in the Western world, many dating and marriage agencies began to offer services overseas. Traditionally, in many societies (including Western societies), men were expected to fill the role of the pursuer. However, the anonymity of the Internet (as well as other factors) has allowed women to take on that role online.

The trend of singles making a Web connection continues to increase, as the percentage of North American singles who have tried Internet dating has grown from two percent in 1999 to over ten percent today (from Canadian Business, February 2002). More than half of online consumers (53%) know someone who has started a friendship or relationship online, and three-quarters of 18-to-24-year-old online consumers (74%) say they do. There is also some academic evidence that the 18–25 age group has significantly taken up online dating.

==Fraud==
Users of online agencies or sites may be susceptible to fraud or other forms of deception. According to the FBI, almost 15,000 complaints categorized as romance scams were reported in 2016.

==Real-life examples==
* Heather Lyon established &quot;The Marriage Bureau&quot; in Bond Street, Mayfair, London, in 1939.
* Joan Ball started the Eros Friendship Bureau Ltd in 1962, renaming it the St. James Computer Dating Service in 1964.
* Ghatak Pakhi Bhai established his matrimonial agency named after him in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 1985.

==Fictional examples==
* &quot;Love Is a Ball&quot; (1963). Charles Boyer plays the head of a matrimonial bureau that finds rich, unsuspecting American women for impoverished European aristocrats.

== Marriage agencies ==

Marriage agencies differ from dating agencies in that they are specifically for those seeking marriage.

=== Origins ===

Marriage agencies have evolved from dating agencies. Historically their processes come from matchmaking processes that extend back to the 1600s in England, when parish vicars played an important role in matching their parishioners with a spouse from the same social class. Similar practices were used in Japan from the 16th century where Nadoko (matchmakers) would perform Omiai (marriage introduction) duties for parents seeking a worthy spouse for their child. In England religious ties were relinquished in 1825 with the advent of dating agencies in London, which became the new option to find someone suitable for those who experienced challenge in meeting a marriage partner.

=== Recent background ===
Changes in culture and society have led to changes in the marriage rate, due to views of single people regarding marriage. In 1960 around 12% of adults between the ages of 25 and 34 had never been married. 10 years later when that same group was between the ages of 35 and 44, 7% of them were still unmarried. A further 10 years later in 1980, when those people were 45 to 54, 5% were still not married. The next group starting in 1970 followed a similar path. In 1960 the marriage rate was 72% for all adults over the age of 18, in 2010 the marriage rate was 51% for the same demographic.

Part of the marriage gap has been reported as being due to people waiting until they are older, have more educational degrees, and are more financially stable. With those who have waited marrying other professionally successful individuals, their desire being indicated as wishing to pass down both educational and financial capital to their children, and ensure stability for their children.

In addition to this there is the growing trend in various developed countries of those who just wish to remain single and have their freedom or to experience what has been termed &quot;delayed adolescence.&quot; Perceived reductions in &quot;partner loyalty&quot;, lower levels of &quot;self-esteem&quot;, stronger desire for &quot;financial stability&quot;, &quot;relationship issues&quot;, and the increased trend of &quot;divorce&quot; among married couples, are often cited as causing many to question whether the partners they meet would be suitable marriage partners. In addition dating app users cite &quot;issues of trust&quot; coming from deceit and dishonest relationship intentions which block them mentally and emotionally from developing serious relationships that could lead to marriage with persons met via dating apps.

=== Description ===

The modern marriage agency works in two principle ways to help clients find a marriage partner:

# By having a group of members specifically seeking marriage partners.
# Matchmaking.

Historically marriage agencies would usually work alone. Modern marriage agencies now often work within federations or associations, enabling effects of scale that allow easier creation of marriage matches because of inter-marriage agency cooperation. This is common in Japan, where the culture, along with social influences have led to marriage agencies being responsible for 5.3% of marriages in 2010 and 2014.

Matchmaking is a core activity for marriage agencies, as their members largely focus on being with someone whom they truly love and are truly compatible with due to increased levels of happiness and fulfillment derived. Marriage agencies use matchmaking to ensure the best chance of marriages being successful in both the long and short term. Challenges come from how skilled matchmakers are as well as how well they know their members. While matchmaking was previously used worldwide to ensure solid alliances between families, modern marriage agency work has greater focus on the psychological aspect of how love forms between two people and their suitability for each other as life partners. Because of this marriage agencies conduct matchmaking to assess compatibility prior to introductions. This type of practice has been common in Japan since the 1940s when the Omiai marriage introduction system was changed from being family background focused to creating love matches for marriage. Matchmaking or marriage matching when done by marriage agencies is performed manually, rather than by computer algorithm which is common with dating apps. While matchmaking on dating apps works to weighted variables derived from profiles, &quot;manual matchmaking&quot; done by marriage agencies comes as a result of marriage agency matchmaking staff developing understanding of their client&#x27;s personalities and desires, often paired with use of big data from searches of collective databases held between partnered marriage agencies within their federation or association.

Registering with a marriage agency requires proof of eligibility for marriage, with marriage agencies commonly requiring a Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage, Certificate of No Record of Marriage, Single Status Affidavit, or other similar legal proof of applicant&#x27;s ability to marry. While such documentation is common for people when marrying overseas, it is uncommon for same country marriages in many western countries.

Marriage agency services such as coaching to help clients overcome issues such as , anxiety and psychological issues held from previous relationships, are becoming more common in order to help them achieve stable loving relationships.

Marriage agencies as distinct from dating agencies also have total focus on their clients getting married, rather than just being life partners, dating, co-habiting, or forming other beneficial relationships.

=== International marriage agencies ===
International marriage agencies, which differ from mail-order bride services, enable clients to search worldwide for their ideal marriage partner. International marriage agency use has been fueled by increased exposure to foreign cultures worldwide. With many in western countries now seeking marriage partners from more traditional eastern cultures, Japan especially, due to cultural values of loyalty, kindness and love being core to the values that those actually desiring marriage are actually seeking, yet having trouble finding in their own countries. As such specific marriage agency types, for example Japanese marriage agencies, have come into existence in order to fulfill desire for those seeking marriage with someone from a specific geographical region or cultural system.

The increase in international marriage agencies also mirrors trends of increased intermarriage, whereby partners from differing ethnic or racial background marry. Within the U.S. only 3% of new marriages were classified as intermarriage in 1967, by 2015 intermarriage had increased to 17% with Asian forming 29% and Hispanic 27% of that figure

=== Marriage agency introductions changes brought by COVID-19 ===
Reduced contact, social distancing, lockdown and other pandemic mitigation measures, marriage agency introductions faced challenges due to COVID-19. At the same time, because of increased time at home leading to feelings of loneliness and people reassessing their lives, demand for marriage agency services and other partner introduction services increased significantly. In various places marriage agencies began making use of online video meeting facilities such as Zoom, in order for them to host virtual marriage introduction parties and online introductions.

<text>South Falkland was an English colony in Newfoundland established by Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, in 1623 on territory in the Avalon Peninsula including the former colony of Renews. Cary appointed Sir Francis Tanfield, his wife&#x27;s cousin, to be the colony&#x27;s first Proprietary Governor. Tanfield founded the colony of South Falkland at Renews in 1623. It was still in existence by 1626 but ultimately failed. The settlers are thought to have returned to England or Ireland by 1630, and Cary granted much of his land to Sir Henry Salisbury who had been Cary&#x27;s only known investor.

<text>Daniel Sexton Gurney (April 13, 1931 – January 14, 2018) was an American racing driver, engineer and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of motorsport, Gurney won four Formula One Grands Prix across 11 seasons. In endurance racing, Gurney won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Ford, as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1959 with Ferrari.

Born in Long Island, Gurney was the son of bass-baritone John R. Gurney and born into a family of engineers. Interested by California hot rod culture, Gurney built his first car aged 19 and became an amateur drag racer. After serving in the United States Army as an artillery mechanic during the Korean War, Gurney entered the 1957 Riverside Grand Prix, beating numerous established drivers including Phil Hill and attracting the attention of Luigi Chinetti, who organised his professional debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with NART. His performance at Le Mans prompted Ferrari to sign Gurney for the season, making his Formula One debut at the after winning the 12 Hours of Sebring with the team two months prior. After achieving two podiums in only four races at Ferrari, Gurney joined BRM in . Following a non-classified championship finish with BRM, Gurney moved to Porsche, where he scored frequent podiums and finished fourth in the 1961 World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He took his maiden win at the 1962 French Grand Prix, which remains Porsche&#x27;s only victory as a constructor in Formula One. 

Gurney moved to Brabham in as their first-ever driver, taking multiple wins in three seasons at the team, including another fourth-placed championship finish in . Alongside Carroll Shelby, Gurney had founded All American Racing in 1964, entering Formula One with Gurney at the wheel in under the chassis name &quot;Eagle&quot;. Despite struggling for reliability with the Len Terry-designed Eagle T1, Gurney took his final victory at the 1967 Belgian Grand Prix, before leaving the sport at the end of . He returned at three Grands Prix in for McLaren, following the death of Bruce McLaren. Gurney achieved four wins, three pole positions, six fastest laps and 19 podiums in Formula One, amongst winning the non-championship 1967 Race of Champions.

Outside of Formula One, Gurney entered 10 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , winning the latter alongside A.J. Foyt in the Ford GT40 Mk IV. His celebration upon winning Le Mans—spraying champagne on the podium—has since become a custom throughout global motorsport. Gurney was a record five-time winner of the Winston Western 500 in the NASCAR Grand National Series and, in American open-wheel racing, was a six-time race winner in USAC Championship Car and twice runner-up in the Indianapolis 500 in 1968 and 1969. He was also a race-winner in the Canadian-American Challenge Cup, the Trans-Am Series and the British Saloon Car Championship. In aerodynamics, he is remembered for his invention of the Gurney flap, and became the first Formula One driver to wear a full-face helmet at the 1968 German Grand Prix. His All American Racers team won 78 official races, including the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Daytona. Gurney was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Early life==
Gurney was born to John R. &quot;Jack&quot; Gurney and Roma Sexton. His father was a graduate of Harvard Business School with a master&#x27;s degree. Dan&#x27;s three uncles were each MIT engineers. His grandfather was F.W. Gurney who was responsible for the invention of the Gurney Ball Bearing. He had one sister, Celisssa. Jack was discovered to have a beautiful voice after taking voice lessons in Paris and changed his career path to become lead basso with the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, eventually retiring in 1947. Jack moved his family to Riverside, California, when Dan was a teenager and had just graduated from Manhasset High School. Young Dan quickly became caught up in the California hot rod culture. At age 19, he built and raced a car that went 138 miles per hour (mph) (222 kilometres per hour [km/h]) at the Bonneville Salt Flats. He later studied at Menlo Junior College, a feeder school for Stanford University. He then became an amateur drag racer and sports car racer. He served in the United States Army for two years as an artillery mechanic during the Korean War.

==Formula One career==

===Driver===

Gurney&#x27;s first major break occurred in the fall of 1957 when he was invited to test Frank Arciero&#x27;s Arciero Special. It was powered by a 4.2-litre reworked Maserati engine with Ferrari running gear, and a Sports Car Engineering Mistral body. This ill-handling brute of a car was very fast, but even top drivers like Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles had found it difficult to handle. He finished second in the inaugural Riverside Grand Prix (behind Shelby), beating established stars like Masten Gregory, Walt Hansgen and Phil Hill. This attracted the attention of famed Ferrari North American importer Luigi Chinetti, who arranged for a factory ride for the young driver at Le Mans in 1958. Gurney, teamed with fellow Californian Bruce Kessler, had worked the car up to fifth overall and handed over to Kessler, who was then caught up in an accident. This performance and others earned him a test run in a works Ferrari, and his Formula One career began with the team in 1959. In just four races that first year, he earned two podium finishes, but the team&#x27;s strict management style did not suit him.
In 1960 he had six non-finishes in seven races behind the wheel of a factory-prepared BRM. At the Dutch Grand Prix, at Zandvoort, a brake system failure on the BRM caused the most serious accident of his career, breaking his arm, killing a young spectator and instilling in him a longstanding distrust of engineers. The accident also caused him to make a change in his driving style that later paid dividends: his tendency to use his brakes more sparingly than his rivals meant that they lasted longer, especially in endurance races.

After rules changes came in effect in , Gurney teamed with Jo Bonnier for the first full season of the factory Porsche team, scoring three second places. He came very close to scoring a maiden victory at Reims, France, in 1961, but his reluctance to block Ferrari driver Giancarlo Baghetti (a move Gurney regarded as dangerous and unsportsmanlike) allowed Baghetti to pass him at the finish line for the win. After Porsche introduced a better car in with an 8-cylinder engine, Gurney broke through at the French Grand Prix at Rouen-Les-Essarts with his first World Championship victory – the only GP win for Porsche as an F1 constructor. One week later, he repeated the success in a non-Championship F1 race in front of Porsche&#x27;s home crowd at Stuttgart&#x27;s Solitude Racetrack. Due to the high costs of racing in F1, Porsche did not continue after the 1962 season. While with Porsche, Gurney met a team public relations executive named Evi Butz, and they married several years later.

Gurney was the first driver hired by Jack Brabham to drive with him for the Brabham Racing Organisation. Brabham scored the maiden victory for his car at the 1963 Solitude race, but Gurney took the team&#x27;s first win in a championship race in 1964 at Rouen. In all, he earned two wins (in 1964) and ten podiums (including five consecutive in 1965) for Brabham before leaving to start his own team. With his victory in the Eagle-Weslake at the 1967 Belgian Grand Prix, Gurney earned a distinction as the only driver in history to score maiden Grand Prix victories for three different manufacturers: Porsche, Brabham and Anglo-American Racers.

Due to his popularity, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine promoted the idea that Gurney run for President of the United States in 1964. This effort was abandoned only when it was &quot;discovered&quot; that he was too young to qualify as a candidate. The campaign was periodically resurrected (usually every four years) by his friends and fans.

Gurney developed a new kind of motorcycle called &quot;Alligator&quot;, which featured an extremely low seat position. While Gurney did not achieve his goal of getting the design licensed for manufacture and sale by a major motorcycle manufacturer, the initial production run of 36 Alligator motorcycles quickly sold out and are now prized collector&#x27;s items.

Gurney&#x27;s tall height, unusual for a race driver, caused constant problems during his career. During the 1.5-litre era of Formula 1, Gurney&#x27;s head and shoulders extended high into the windstream compared to his shorter competitors, giving him (he felt) an aerodynamic disadvantage in the tiny, underpowered cars. At nearly , Gurney struggled to fit into the tight Ford GT40 cockpit, so master fabricator Phil Remington installed a roof bubble over the driver&#x27;s seat to allow space for Gurney&#x27;s helmet—now known as a &quot;Gurney bubble&quot;. In a fortunate error, the Italian coachbuilder who built the body for the 1964 Le Mans class-winning, closed-cockpit Cobra Daytona GT coupe driven by Gurney and Bob Bondurant mistakenly made the cockpit &quot;greenhouse&quot; two inches too tall — the only thing that permitted Gurney to fit in the car comfortably.

===Manufacturer===

In 1962, Gurney and Carroll Shelby began dreaming of building an American racing car to compete with the best European makes. Shelby convinced Goodyear, which wanted to challenge Firestone&#x27;s domination of American racing at the time, to sponsor the team. Goodyear&#x27;s president Victor Holt suggested the name, &quot;All American Racers&quot;, and the team was formed in 1965. Gurney was not comfortable with the name at first, fearing it sounded somewhat jingoistic, but felt compelled to agree to his benefactor&#x27;s suggestion.

Their initial focus was Indianapolis and Goodyear&#x27;s battle with Firestone. Because Gurney&#x27;s first love was road racing, especially in Europe, he wanted to win the Formula One World Championship while driving an American Grand Prix &#x27;Eagle&#x27;. The car has often been characterised as a primarily British-based effort; in later interviews, Gurney was clear that the car was designed and built by crew members based in the All American Racers Southern California-based facility. Partnered with British engine maker Weslake, the Formula One effort was called &quot;Anglo American Racers.&quot; The Weslake V12 engine was not ready for the 1966 Grand Prix season so the team used outdated four-cylinder, 2.7-litre Coventry-Climax engines for their first appearance in the second race of the year in Belgium. This was the race of the sudden torrential downpour captured in the feature film Grand Prix. Although Gurney completed the race in seventh place, he was unclassified. Gurney scored the team&#x27;s first Championship points three weeks later by finishing fifth in the French Grand Prix at Reims.

The next season the team failed to finish any of the first three races, but on June 18, 1967, Gurney took a historic victory in the Belgian Grand Prix. Starting in the middle of the first row, Gurney initially followed Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus and the BRM of Jackie Stewart. A poor start left Gurney deep in the field at the end of the first lap. Throughout the race, Gurney&#x27;s Weslake V-12 suffered a high-speed misfire, but he was able to continue racing. Jim Clark encountered problems on Lap 12 that dropped him down to ninth position. Having moved up to second spot, Gurney set the fastest lap of the race on Lap 19. Two laps later he and his Eagle took the lead and came home over a minute ahead of Stewart.

This win came just a week after his surprise victory with A. J. Foyt at 24 hours of Le Mans, where Gurney spontaneously began the now-familiar winner&#x27;s tradition of spraying champagne from the podium to celebrate the unexpected win against the Ferraris and the other Ford GT40 teams. Gurney said later that he took great satisfaction in proving wrong the critics (including some members of the Ford team) who predicted the two great drivers, normally heated rivals, would break their car in an effort to show each other up.

Unfortunately, the victory in Belgium was the high point for AAR as engine problems continued to plague the Eagle. Despite the antiquated engine tooling used by the Weslake factory (dating from World War I), failures rarely stemmed from the engine design itself, but more often from unreliable peripheral systems like fuel pumps, fuel injection and the oil delivery system. He led the 1967 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring when a driveshaft failed two laps from the end with a 42-second lead in hand. After a third-place finish in Canada that year, the car would finish only one more race. By the end of the 1968 season, Gurney was driving a McLaren-Ford. His last Formula One race was the 1970 British Grand Prix.

===Legacy===
Among American Formula One drivers, his 86 Grand Prix starts ranks third, and his total of four GP wins is second only to Mario Andretti. Perhaps the greatest tribute to Gurney&#x27;s driving ability, however, was paid by the father of Scottish World Champion Jim Clark. The elder Clark took Gurney aside at his son&#x27;s funeral in 1968 and confided that he was the only driver Clark had ever feared on the track. (Horton, 1999).

Gurney was particularly noted for an exceptionally fluid driving style. On rare occasions, as when his car fell behind with minor mechanical troubles and he felt he had nothing to lose, he would abandon his classic technique and adopt a more aggressive (and riskier) style. This circumstance produced what many observers consider the finest driving performance of his career, when a punctured tire put him nearly two laps down halfway through the 1967 Rex Mays 300 Indycar race at Riverside, California. He produced an inspired effort, made up the deficit and won the race with a dramatic last-lap pass of runner-up Bobby Unser.

The 2010 Monterey Motorsports Reunion (formerly the Monterey Historic Automobile Races) was held in honor of Gurney.

A 2016 academic paper reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine. Gurney was ranked the 14th-best Formula One driver of all time.

==American Championship Car==

While competing in Formula One, Gurney also raced each year in the Indianapolis 500 from 1962 to 1970. Gurney made his Indy début at the wheel of a space-frame, rear-engined car designed by John Crosthwaite and built by American hot-rodder Mickey Thompson Despite a misfiring engine, Gurney ran comfortably in the top 10 until a transmission seal failed on the 92nd lap. The next year he drove for Team Lotus and finished 7th. He failed to finish in his next four appearances in the 500 mile race, but beginning in 1968 until his last attempt in 1970 he finished 2nd, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively. In 1969, he did not race in Formula One, instead racing in the USAC Championship Car series and also in CanAm. He started a total of 28 Champ Car races, winning 7 times among his 18 top tens. In 1969, he finished 4th in total points, despite starting only half the races of most top drivers (and would have finished second in the season standings to champion Mario Andretti if not for a driveshaft failure while leading comfortably with three laps remaining in the season finale at Riverside). In 1968, he finished 7th with only 5 starts.

==NASCAR / SCCA Trans-Am career==

Gurney&#x27;s first career NASCAR start was in 1962. In 1963, he drove a Holman-Moody Ford to fifth place in the Daytona 500.
Gurney was nearly unbeatable in a NASCAR Grand National car at Riverside International Raceway in California. Four of his five victories came with the famed Wood Brothers, in 1964, 1965, 1966 and 1968, in cars all numbered 121 (a simple graphic addition to the team&#x27;s traditional &quot;21&quot;). The serial success of the Gurney/Wood Brothers combination did not sit well with NASCAR officials, so in 1967 Gurney signed to drive a Mercury for Bill Stroppe and legendary NASCAR crew chief Bud Moore. However, the 1967 Motor Trend 500 was won by Gurney&#x27;s teammate, Parnelli Jones after Gurney retired with engine troubles. 
He also won the pole for the 1970 Riverside race in a Plymouth Superbird. Gurney is credited with numerous appearances in NASCAR Grand American stockcars, a pony car division that existed between 1968 and 1971, but these results came in races co-sanctioned with SCCA&#x27;s Trans-Am, where Dan competed regularly for Mercury, and later Plymouth.

At about the time Gurney began making occasional appearances in stock cars in the United States, Dan took a Chevrolet Impala to England and entered it in several &quot;saloon car&quot; (sedan) races. In a race at Silverstone in 1962, he led the local Jaguar drivers handily until a wheel broke. When he returned with the same car for a race three months later, the local club&#x27;s technical inspectors disallowed his entry.

Gurney and his protege Swede Savage drove factory-sponsored, AAR built Plymouth Barracudas in the 1970 Trans-Am Series. Cutbacks at Chrysler forced Gurney to cut back to a one-car effort mid-season with Savage driving. In his swan song as a driver, in October 1970 Gurney returned for the season finale at his beloved Riverside, finishing fifth.

In 1980, Gurney came out of a 10-year retirement to help old friend Les Richter, the president of Riverside. (Gurney&#x27;s adoption of the number that became most closely identified with his career, 48, was a nod to Richter&#x27;s NFL number.) Gurney agreed to drive a second Rod Osterlund Chevrolet for one NASCAR race as teammate to 1979 rookie of the year Dale Earnhardt. For added publicity and supposedly as a condition of allowing Gurney to drive in the race after a 10-year layoff, Richter insisted that Gurney attend the racing school run by former teammate and friend Bob Bondurant (Gurney and Bondurant had shared the GT-class-winning Cobra Daytona coupe at Le Mans in 1964). After Gurney&#x27;s refresher session, Richter called Bondurant and asked how Gurney had done. &quot;He didn&#x27;t need a refresher,&quot; Bondurant reportedly told Richter. &quot;He was faster than me then, and he still is.&quot; Ticket sales surged upon the announcement of Gurney&#x27;s return. In a Chevy MonteCarlo painted white with blue and carrying his famed number 48, Gurney qualified seventh and easily ran with the leaders. Displaying his usual fluid style, Gurney raced up to second place, and was running third when the input shaft in the transmission let go, something Dan later said he had never seen happen before or since.
==With Shelby-American Racing==

Gurney was recruited by Carroll Shelby, who was mounting a Ford-powered challenge to Ferrari&#x27;s dominance of the FIA 2+ liter GT class in the World Championship of Makes for the 1964 season. Shelby developed the Shelby Daytona Coupe, a derivative of the AC Cobra that had competed the previous year, with a lower drag coupe body. The team of Gurney and Bob Bondurant drove the Shelby Coupe to a GT class win, fourth overall, in the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans and Gurney took it to another class win, third overall, in the RAC Tourist Trophy race. Ford&#x27;s hopes for edging Ferrari for the Manufacturers&#x27; title at the 1000 km Monza season finale were dashed when the event was cancelled. In 1965 Ford teams won the Manufacturers&#x27; title for the GT class, although Gurney was only with Shelby for Le Mans and did not finish.

Gurney joined the Shelby-American campaign in the Sports Prototype class for 1966, which fielded the new 7 liter GT40 Mk II. Gurney&#x27;s best finish that year was second place, teamed with Jerry Grant in a Mk II at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Between success with the new Mk II and the older GT40s, Ford secured the World Championship of Makes for sports cars, sealed by a resounding 1-2-3 finish at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, recalled in the 2019 film &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;, in which Gurney was portrayed by his son.

Gurney stayed with Shelby-American for their 1967 World Sportscar Championship campaign. Things were not going smoothly in development of Ford&#x27;s next Prototype entry. After problems highlighted by the fatal accident of Ken Miles in testing the Mark III &quot;J Car,&quot; another iteration was designed but it would not be built in time for the season opener at the 24 Hours of Daytona. After a dismal showing at Daytona with the Mk II, Shelby introduced the Mk IV at the 12 Hours of Sebring with a resounding win by Mario Andretti. After that demonstration the Mk IVs were held in preparation for Le Mans, with Ford&#x27;s hopes for a repeat championship resting on the GT40s and GT40-derived Mirages campaigned by other teams in the intervening races. A controversial decision to withhold points from the Mirage win at the Spa 1000 km event from Ford&#x27;s season credit virtually killed hopes for a repeat championship and gave Le Mans an all-or-nothing aspect for Ford. Four Mk IVs were entered, two with Shelby-American and two with Holman and Moody, Ford&#x27;s unofficial NASCAR team.

Pre-race press chatter about the Mk IV&#x27;s prospects, and in particular about Shelby&#x27;s team of Gurney and Indy car driver A. J. Foyt, was negative: the Mk IV was too heavy and put too much demand on its brakes, it was structurally weak, it would be difficult to control, Foyt the oval racer was in over his head, Foyt would try to prove himself in the shadow of sportscar master Gurney, and so on. The static about Foyt was more stereotype than reality, as he had shown his road course mettle with a second-place showing at the grueling 12 Hours of Sebring in a Mk II earlier that year. As it turned out the race went like clockwork for Gurney and Foyt, establishing an early lead and a comfortable margin over the rival Ferraris, driving at a disciplined pace, and establishing a new record of 388 laps. On the podium, Gurney took the magnum of champagne and saw an opportunity for a playfully pointed statement towards journalists he saw crowding around. He shook the bottle and aimed the spritz at the naysayers. Soon he was giving everyone a shower, which became a podium tradition.

Ford&#x27;s factory efforts for the World Sportscar Championship ended that year, as a new engine capacity limit of 3 liters for the Sports Prototype class made their entries ineligible and they had no engines that could be eligible and competitive. Shelby and Gurney independently turned their efforts to the SCCA Trans-Am series for 1968. Shelby and Gurney teamed up again in 1970, with Shelby hired for Gurney&#x27;s All American Racing team.

==Cannonball Run==
In November 1971, Gurney and co-driver Brock Yates won the first competitive running of the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, known widely as the Cannonball Run, an unofficial, unsanctioned automobile race from New York City to Redondo Beach, California. Gurney and Yates made the run in 35 hours and 54 minutes in a stock 1971 Sunoco-blue Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona coupe capable of . They averaged approximately over the distance, consuming of gasoline. Gurney and Yates received no prize for winning; however, the winning car is now part of a private collection and valued at several million dollars.

==Full-time team owner==

Upon his retirement from Formula One, Gurney devoted himself full-time to his role as car maker and team owner. He was the sole owner, Chairman and CEO of All American Racers from 1970 until his son, Justin, assumed the title of CEO in early 2011. The team won 78 races (including the Indianapolis 500, the 12 Hours of Sebring, and the 24 Hours of Daytona) and eight championships, while Gurney&#x27;s Eagle race car customers also won three Indianapolis 500 races and three championships.

In 1978, Gurney wrote an open memo to other race car owners with what is now known as the &quot;White Paper&quot; in which Gurney called for a series controlled more by the owners or &quot;actual participants&quot; than under the USAC banner. After much debate, CART was formed with Gurney and other owners like Roger Penske, Pat Patrick, and Bob Fletcher. CART began its first full season of competition in March 1979 and thus the first split in open wheel racing began.

AAR withdrew from the CART series in 1986, but enjoyed tremendous success with Toyota in the IMSA GTP series, where in 1992 and 1993 Toyota Eagles won 17 consecutive races, back-to-back Drivers&#x27; and Manufacturers&#x27; Championships, and wins in the endurance classics of Daytona and Sebring.

The team returned to CART as the factory Toyota team in 1996, but left again after the 1999 season when Goodyear withdrew from the series and Toyota ended their relationship with the team. In 2000, Dan campaigned a Toyota Atlantic car for his son, Alex Gurney under the AAR banner.

==Death==
In 2018 Gurney died of complications from pneumonia; he was 86 years old. All American Racers announced the news on its website: &quot;With one last smile on his handsome face, Dan drove off into the unknown just before noon today, January 14, 2018. In deepest sorrow, with gratitude in our hearts for the love and joy you have given us during your time on this earth, we say &#x27;Godspeed.&#x27;&quot;

Gurney was survived by his wife, Evi, six children, and 8 grandchildren. As per his final wishes, his memorial service and funeral were private.

<doc id="554530" wikidata="Q2068762" url="?curid=554530" title="Richard of Cirencester">
<text>Richard of Cirencester (; before 1340–1400) was a cleric and minor historian of the Benedictine abbey at Westminster. He was highly famed in the 18th and 19th century as the author of &quot;The Description of Britain&quot; before it was proved to have been a later forgery in 1846.

==Life==
His name (as &quot;Circestre&quot;) first appears on the chamberlain&#x27;s list of the monks of that foundation drawn up in the year 1355. In 1391, he obtained a licence from the abbot to go to Rome and in this the abbot gave his testimony to Richard&#x27;s perfect and sincere observance of religion for upwards of thirty years. In 1400 Richard spent nine nights of the infirmary of the abbey, and likely died that January.

His only known extant work are the four books of the &quot;Historial Mirror of the Deeds of the Kings of England&quot; (), covering the years from 447 to 1066. The manuscript of this is in the university library at Cambridge and was edited in two volumes for the Rolls Series by John Mayor. At the conclusion of the fourth book Richard expresses his intention of continuing his narrative from the accession of William I, and incorporating a sketch of the Conqueror&#x27;s career from his birth. This design he does not, however, appear to have carried into effect.

The value of the &quot;Historial Mirror&quot; as a contribution to our historical knowledge is but slight, for it is mainly a compilation from other writers and even in transcribing these the compiler is guilty of great carelessness. He gives, however, numerous charters relating to Westminster Abbey and also a very complete account of the saints whose tombs were in the abbey church, especially concerning Edward the Confessor. The work was, however, largely used by historians and antiquaries until, with the rise of a more critical spirit, its value became more accurately estimated. Besides the &quot;Historial Mirror&quot; Richard also wrote, according to a 1396 letter from William of Woodford to Archbishop Thomas of Canterbury, a treatise on the offices (&quot;&quot;) and there was formerly in the cathedral library at Peterborough another tract ascribed to him entitled &quot;Super Symbolum&quot;. Of neither of these works, however, does any known copy now exist.

==Richard of Westminster==

Richard is best known for the historical forgery perpetrated by Charles Bertram known as &quot;The Description of Britain&quot; (). Bertram&#x27;s original manuscript ascribed this to &quot;Richard the Westminsterian monk&quot; (&#x27;), but a British academic looking to verify its authenticity discovered that Richard of Cirencester had been at Westminster around the time of the work&#x27;s supposed composition. It was then published under a variant of his name (&#x27;) and the conflation was universally accepted, to the point where Richard&#x27;s name is more associated with the discredited forgery than with his own works.

<text>Cintheaux () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==Geography==
The commune is located between Caen and Falaise and is the home to the Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery.

Gaumesnil was originally a separate village, now attached to Cintheaux; it has fewer than 19 residents.

==Sights==
The main town is situated around the church of Saint-Germain, classified as an official French historic monument. It was built around 1150 by the Marmion family; Robert Marmion offered it in patronage to the Barbery Abbey, subject to the Bayeux diocese, in 1181. The main (north) chapel and the cross tower, dating to the 16th century, was destroyed in 1688. The north bell tower was added in the 18th century. The church was restored between 1857 and 1902.

==History==
===World War II===
Cintheaux was devastated by Allied artillery, which sought to annihilate the 12th SS Panzer Division in 1944, during Operation Totalize.

<doc id="554546" wikidata="Q628906" url="?curid=554546" title="Crossover (evolutionary algorithm)">
<text>Crossover in evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation, also called recombination, is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. It is one way to stochastically generate new solutions from an existing population, and is analogous to the crossover that happens during sexual reproduction in biology. New solutions can also be generated by cloning an existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction. Newly generated solutions may be mutated before being added to the population. The aim of recombination is to transfer good characteristics from two different parents to one child.

Different algorithms in evolutionary computation may use different data structures to store genetic information, and each genetic representation can be recombined with different crossover operators. Typical data structures that can be recombined with crossover are bit arrays, vectors of real numbers, or trees.

The list of operators presented below is by no means complete and serves mainly as an exemplary illustration of this dyadic genetic operator type. More operators and more details can be found in the literature.

==Crossover for binary arrays==
Traditional genetic algorithms store genetic information in a chromosome represented by a bit array. Crossover methods for bit arrays are popular and an illustrative example of genetic recombination.

===One-point crossover===
A point on both parents&#x27; chromosomes is picked randomly, and designated a &#x27;crossover point&#x27;. Bits to the right of that point are swapped between the two parent chromosomes. This results in two offspring, each carrying some genetic information from both parents.

===Two-point and k-point crossover===
In two-point crossover, two crossover points are picked randomly from the parent chromosomes. The bits in between the two points are swapped between the parent organisms. 

Two-point crossover is equivalent to performing two single-point crossovers with different crossover points. This strategy can be generalized to k-point crossover for any positive integer k, picking k crossover points.

=== Uniform crossover===
In uniform crossover, typically, each bit is chosen from either parent with equal probability. Other mixing ratios are sometimes used, resulting in offspring which inherit more genetic information from one parent than the other.
In a uniform crossover, we don’t divide the chromosome into segments, rather we treat each gene separately. In this, we essentially flip a coin for each chromosome to decide whether or not it will be included in the off-spring.

==Crossover for integer or real-valued genomes==

For the crossover operators presented above and for most other crossover operators for bit strings, it holds that they can also be applied accordingly to integer or real-valued genomes whose genes each consist of an integer or real-valued number. Instead of individual bits, integer or real-valued numbers are then simply copied into the child genome. The offspring lie on the remaining corners of the hyperbody spanned by the two parents formula_1 and formula_2, as exemplified in the accompanying image for the three-dimensional case. 

=== Discrete recombination ===
If the rules of the uniform crossover for bit strings are applied during the generation of the offspring, this is also called &quot;discrete recombination&quot;.

=== Intermediate recombination ===

In this recombination operator, the allele values of the child genome formula_3 are generated by mixing the alleles of the two parent genomes formula_4 and formula_5:
:formula_6 randomly equally distributed per gene formula_7
The choice of the interval formula_8 causes that besides the interior of the hyperbody spanned by the allele values of the parent genes additionally a certain environment for the range of values of the offspring is in question. A value of formula_9 is recommended for formula_10 to counteract the tendency to reduce the allele values that otherwise exists at formula_11. 

The adjacent figure shows for the two-dimensional case the range of possible new alleles of the two exemplary parents formula_12 and formula_13 in intermediate recombination. The offspring of discrete recombination formula_14 and formula_15 are also plotted. Intermediate recombination satisfies the arithmetic calculation of the allele values of the child genome required by virtual alphabet theory. Discrete and intermediate recombination are used as a standard in the evolution strategy.

== Crossover for permutations ==
For combinatorial tasks, permutations are usually used that are specifically designed for genomes that are themselves permutations of a set. The underlying set is usually a subset of formula_16 or formula_17. If 1- or n-point or uniform crossover for integer genomes is used for such genomes, a child genome may contain some values twice and others may be missing. This can be remedied by &quot;genetic repair&quot;, e.g. by replacing the redundant genes in positional fidelity for missing ones from the other child genome. 

In order to avoid the generation of invalid offspring, special crossover operators for permutations have been developed which fulfill the basic requirements of such operators for permutations, namely that all elements of the initial permutation are also present in the new one and only the order is changed. It can be distinguished between combinatorial tasks, where all sequences are admissible, and those where there are constraints in the form of inadmissible partial sequences. A well-known representative of the first task type is the traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the goal is to visit a set of cities exactly once on the shortest tour. An example of the constrained task type is the scheduling of multiple workflows. Workflows involve sequence constraints on some of the individual work steps. For example, a thread cannot be cut until the corresponding hole has been drilled in a workpiece. Such problems are also called &quot;order-based permutations&quot;.

In the following, two crossover operators are presented as examples, the partially mapped crossover (PMX) motivated by the TSP and the order crossover (OX1) designed for order-based permutations. A second offspring can be produced in each case by exchanging the parent chromosomes.

=== Partially mapped crossover (PMX) ===
The PMX operator was designed as a recombination operator for TSP like Problems. The explanation of the procedure is illustrated by an example: 
=== Order crossover (OX1) ===
The order crossover goes back to Davis in its original form and is presented here in a slightly generalized version with more than two crossover points. It transfers information about the relative order from the second parent to the offspring. First, the number and position of the crossover points are determined randomly. The resulting gene sequences are then processed as described below:
Among other things, order crossover is well suited for scheduling multiple workflows, when used in conjunction with 1- and n-point crossover.

=== Further crossover operators for permutations ===
Over time, a large number of crossover operators for permutations have been proposed, so the following list is only a small selection. For more information, the reader is referred to the literature.

# cycle crossover (CX)
# order-based crossover (OX2)
# position-based crossover (POS)
# edge recombination
# voting recombination (VR)
# alternating-positions crossover (AP)
# maximal preservative crossover (MPX)
# merge crossover (MX)
# sequential constructive crossover operator (SCX)

The usual approach to solving TSP-like problems by genetic or, more generally, evolutionary algorithms, presented earlier, is either to repair illegal descendants or to adjust the operators appropriately so that illegal offspring do not arise in the first place. Alternatively, Riazi suggests the use of a double chromosome representation, which avoids illegal offspring.

<text>Clécy () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

In 1932 it was awarded the title The Capital of [[Norman Switzerland|Suisse Normande]] by the Tourism Minister Monsieur Gourdeau.

==Geography==

Clécy is on the River Orne, in the middle of Norman Switzerland, about s south of Caen. Covering it is the second largest commune in the canton of Le Hom. 

The Commune consists of the following of villages and hamlets, Roche Taillis, Les Thomas, Le Clos d&#x27;Ailly, La Haute Bigne, La Faverie, Les Berthaumes, La Loterie, La Fresnée and Clécy. 

Called the &quot;Capital of Norman Switzerland&quot;, the village of Clécy owes its fame to the rugged and verdant Armorican massif, with valleys through which the Orne flows. In addition to the Orne, two streams, The Val Fournet and La Porte also flow through the commune. 

The Commune with another 20 communes shares part of a 2,115 hectare, Natura 2000 conservation area, called the Vallée de l&#x27;Orne et ses affluents. 

Plenty of outdoor activities are available: kayaking, paragliding, climbing, hill walking and mountain biking, taking advantage of the geology of Norman Switzerland.

==History==
The name &quot;Clécy&quot; is mentioned in 860 in the reign of Charles the Bald.

When French cantons were created, Clécy was the capital of the canton. This ceased to be the case after restructuring in 1801.

Clécy has a wealth of historical treasures: Châteaux and manor houses are spread all over Clécy and its surroundings. The Château de la Landelle is one of the oldest.

More recently, painters such as Paul-Émile Pissarro, Moteley and Andre Hardy have painted landscapes around Clécy.

==Administration==


==Population==

Its inhabitants are called &quot;Clécyens&quot; in French.
==Economy==
* Fromagerie Vallée (Valley Cheesemaker)

==Sights==

* The Château de La Landelle is one of the oldest monuments in the village. At its base it is in the form of a cross, originally on one floor, but was changed to two floors when the wings were reworked. In the Second World War it was occupied by the Germans.
* Musée André Hardy (André Hardy Museum) 
* Musée du chemin de fer miniature (Museum of miniature trains)
* Eglise St Pierre (St Paul&#x27;s church) (15th century)
* Clécy Viaduct (1866)

==Sport==
The commune has an 18 hole golf course, Golf de Clecy Cantelou.

==Personalities==
* Paul-Émile Pissarro (1884 – 1972) a French impressionist and neo-impressionist painter, died here.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Clécy is twinned with:

* Ermington, United Kingdom &quot;since 1980&quot;
* Beyne-Heusay, Belgium &quot;since 1976&quot;

<doc id="554553" wikidata="Q5450851" url="?curid=554553" title="Finnish noun cases">
<text>Finnish nominals, which include pronouns, adjectives, and numerals, are declined in a large number of grammatical cases, whose uses and meanings are detailed here. See also Finnish grammar.

Many meanings expressed by case markings in Finnish correspond to phrases or expressions containing prepositions in most Indo-European languages. Because so much information is coded in Finnish through its cases, the use of adpositions (postpositions in this case) is more limited than in English, for instance.

==List of Finnish cases==
Note regarding the examples: Finnish has no grammatical gender nor definite and indefinite articles. Thus, context may be required to get an accurate translation.
===Grammatical cases===
The grammatical cases perform core linguistic functions such as signaling who initiates an action or the object of an action.

====Nominative====
The basic form of the noun.
:Characteristic ending: none in the singular
: = &#x27;a/the house&#x27;
: = &#x27;a/the book&#x27;
: = &#x27;a/the hill&#x27;
: = &#x27;(the) water&#x27;

====Genitive====
Characteristic ending: possibly modified by consonant gradation: . For the nouns and adjectives that have two vowel stems, the weak vowel stem comes from the genitive singular.
:The genitive indicates possession. It is also used preceding postpositions. However, it is homophonous (but not cognate) to the accusative, which may cause some confusion.
: = &#x27;the pictures in the book&#x27;
: = &#x27;the walls of the house&#x27;
: = &#x27;on top of the hill&#x27;
: = &#x27;under water&#x27;

:Finnish also uses possessive affixes together with the genitive case
: = &#x27;her/his house(s)&#x27;

====Accusative====
This case marks direct objects. The accusative indicates telicity; that is, the object has been finalized or the intended action is done. Note that a morphologically distinct accusative case exists in Finnish only for the personal pronouns and the personal interrogative pronoun:

:Singular
:* = me
:* = you
:* = you (polite)
:* = him/her/it/them
:Plural
:* = us
:* = you
:* = them
:Question
:* = whom

In contrast, nouns, adjectives, numerals, and other pronouns, do not have a distinct accusative case. Instead, singular direct objects look like the genitive in direct address ( &quot;I&#x27;ll bring the carpet&quot;) and in the nominative with both imperatives ( &quot;Bring the carpet!&quot;) and passives ( &quot;The carpet has been brought&quot;). Plural direct objects always appear in the nominative plural.

Traditionally, Finnish grammars have considered, on syntactic grounds, the accusative to be a case unto itself, despite its appearing identical to the nominative or genitive case. The recently published major Finnish grammar Iso suomen kielioppi takes a morphological point of view and does not list the accusative except for the personal pronouns and , while at the same time acknowledging the argument for the traditional view. The existence or nonexistence of an accusative case in Finnish thus depends on one&#x27;s point of view. Historically, the similarity of the accusative and genitive endings is coincidental. The older accusative ending was , but in modern Finnish an &quot;m&quot; has become an &quot;n&quot; when it is the last sound of a word.

====Partitive====
Characteristic ending: , where the &#x27;t&#x27; elides if intervocalic. The consonant stem of a noun (if any) comes from the partitive singular. Otherwise the ending is added to the strong vowel stem.
:The basic meaning of this case is a lack of telicity, that is, it is not indicated whether the intended result has been achieved. For example, &quot;I drank water-part.&quot; indicates that there is possibly some water left, while the accusative indicates all water has been consumed. It is not perfectivity. The partitive is the second most common case in Finnish. It has also other uses:
:After numerals, except number 1:
:* = &#x27;three houses&#x27;
:* = &#x27;two children&#x27;
:For incomplete actions and ongoing processes whose ending or end result is unknown (the partitive object):
:* = &quot;I&#x27;m reading a book&quot;
:* = &quot;s/he was teaching me to read&quot;
:* = &quot;I love you&quot;
:* = &quot;I thought about tomorrow&quot;
:With nouns of indefinite number or substance nouns (the partitive object):
:* = &quot;do you have any books?&quot;
:* = &quot;I want some water&quot;
:For negative statements and for tentative inquiries (the partitive object):
:* = &quot;there is not a book in the house&quot;
:* = &quot;I didn&#x27;t see him/her&quot;
:* = &quot;can I borrow the book?&quot;
:With prepositions
:* = &quot;before the hill&quot;
:* = &quot;without a coat&quot;
:Very rarely indicates location (coming from/ being found somewhere):
:* = &quot;closer to the shore&quot;
:* = &quot;further west&quot;

The formation of the partitive plural is rather variable, but the basic principle is to add &#x27;-i-&#x27; to the inflecting stem, followed by the &#x27;-(t)a&#x27; partitive ending. However, in a similar way to verb imperfects, the &#x27;-i-&#x27; can cause changes to the final vowel of the stem, leading to an apparent diversity of forms.

===Locative cases===
The most prototypical function of locative cases is to indicate location, as the name suggests. However, they are also used in a range of syntactic constructions, much like prepositions in Indo-European languages (e.g. &quot;We&#x27;re *at* school&quot; vs. &quot;We&#x27;re good *at* math&quot;, in which only the first &quot;at&quot; has a locative meaning). In Finnish, the suffix as a locative means &quot;on (top)&quot;, but may function to code the idea of &quot;being used as an instrument&quot;, e.g. &quot;I write with a pen&quot; (lit. &#x27;I write pen-on&#x27;).

Two different kinds of suffixes are used, the internal locatives (&quot;-s-&quot;) and the external locatives (&quot;-l-&quot;).

The word in a locative case refers to the verb, for example, in the word &quot;in the window&quot; refers to the verb &quot;I try on&quot;, not to the adjacent noun &quot;pants&quot;. The sentence reads out as &quot;I&#x27;m in the window, trying on pants&quot;. However, in context due to the instrumental nature of the window and the word order, the sentence stands for &quot;I&#x27;m trying on pants (on display) in the window&quot;.

===Internal locatives===
====Inessive====
Characteristic ending added to the weak vowel stem.
:The first of the six so-called &quot;local&quot; cases, which as their basic meaning correspond to locational prepositions in English. The inessive carries the basic meaning &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;in&quot;
:* = &quot;in the house&quot;
:It is also commonplace to indicate time or immediate contact with the inessive
:* = &quot;in December&quot;
:* = &quot;on the Christmas tree&quot;

====Elative====
Characteristic ending added to the weak vowel stem.
:The second of the local cases, with the basic meaning of &quot;coming out from inside&quot; or &quot;out of&quot;
:* = &quot;(he) came out of the house&quot;
:Like the inessive, the elative can also be used to indicate time or immediate contact. Can also indicate origin or cause.
:* = &quot;since last Christmas&quot;
:* = &quot;get out of the bed&quot;
:* = &quot;made of wool&quot;
:* = &quot;green with envy&quot;
:The elative is also used to express a liking.
:* = &quot;I like coffee&quot;

====Illative====
The ending is usually &quot;-Vn&quot;, where &quot;V&quot; indicates the preceding vowel of the stem. Singular forms use the strong stem form. In cases where the genitive stem already ends in a long vowel the ending is (singular) and (plural). However, for words of one syllable the ending is always &quot;-hVn&quot; and this form is also used in plural forms where the plural stem already contains a vowel (other than &quot;i&quot; ) immediately before the plural &quot;i&quot;.

:Some dialects, such as Pohjanmaa, use the &quot;-hVn&quot; more generally.

:This is the third of the local cases, with the basic meaning &quot;into&quot;
:* = &quot;(he) went into the house&quot; &quot;- regular formation from&quot; -Vn
:* = &quot;into the water&quot; &quot;- regular formation from&quot; , &quot;strong singular stem vete-&quot; -Vn
:* = &quot;into the waters&quot; &quot;- regular formation from&quot; , &quot;plural stem vesi-&quot; -Vn
:* = &quot;to the moon&quot; - &quot;single syllable variation&quot; -hVn
:* = &quot;to London&quot; - &quot;long vowel stem variation from&quot; &quot;(London)&quot; -seen
:* = &quot;into the beautiful house&quot; - has singular stem&quot; -kaunii- therefore -seen variation
:* = &quot;into the beautiful houses&quot; - &quot;plural&quot; -siin because of singular -seen &quot;and plural&quot; -hVn &quot;due to the additional vowel&quot; i &quot;in the plural stem &quot;taloi&quot;&quot;

:The illative can also indicate close contact, time or cause
:* = &quot;until tomorrow&quot; (from )
:* = &quot;until spring&quot; (from )
:* = &quot;one can die of cold&quot;
:* = &quot;the reason for, the cause of something&quot;

===External locatives===
====Adessive====
Characteristic ending -lla/-llä added to the weak vowel stem.
:The fourth of the local cases, with the basic meaning &#x27;on top of&#x27; or &#x27;in close proximity of&#x27;
:* = &quot;on the hill&quot;
:* = &quot;at the door&quot;
:Adessive is also used with the verb &#x27;olla&#x27; to indicate possession
:* = &quot;I have a book&quot; 
:It can also indicate time, instrument, means or way
:* = &quot;in the morning&quot;
:* = &quot;in the winter&quot; (but note = &quot;last winter&quot;)
:* = &quot;by bus&quot;
:* = &quot;with a hammer&quot;
:* = &quot;to walk on tiptoe/ on one&#x27;s toes&quot;
:The adessive is very commonly used in a way that is equivalent to the Swedish preposition &quot;med&quot; (or English &quot;with&quot;), but this is traditionally deprecated as ungrammatical
:* = &quot;we do not know with certainty&quot; (cf. Swedish &quot;med säkerhet&quot;)
:* = &quot;with love&quot; (as a letter closing or greeting)
:* = &quot;pancakes with jam&quot;

====Ablative====
Characteristic ending added to the weak vowel stem.
:The fifth of the local cases, with the basic meaning &quot;from off of&quot; - a poor English equivalent, but necessary to distinguish it from &quot;from out of&quot;, which would be elative.
:* = &quot;from (off) the hill&quot;
:* = &quot;(I) got up from the sofa&quot;
:* = &quot;Liisa got the book from me&quot;
:The ablative can also indicate time and it can be used to convey information about qualities
:* = &quot;at eight (o&#x27;clock)&quot;
:* = (freely:) &quot;she has a pleasant appearance&quot;

====Allative====
Characteristic ending added to the weak vowel stem.
:The sixth of the local cases, with the basic meaning &quot;onto&quot;.
:* = &quot;onto the hill&quot;
:Another meaning is &quot;to someone&quot; or &quot;for someone&quot; (the grammatical role served by the dative case in many other languages)
:* = &quot;I give the book to Liisa&quot;
:* = &quot;a table for two&quot;
:* = &quot;it is important to me&quot;
:With verbs of sensation, it is possible to use either the ablative or allative case
:* = &quot;(it) smells good&quot;

==&quot;General locatives&quot; and other cases==
The name &quot;general locatives&quot; is sometimes used of the essive and translative cases (as well as partitive above) because their oldest meanings imply that they have been used to indicate location.

=== Essive ===
Characteristic ending -na. If the noun or adjective has two vowel stems, the strong vowel stem comes from the essive singular. NB the consonant stem used to be quite common in the essive, and some nouns and adjectives still have this feature.
:This case sometimes carries the meaning of a temporary state of being, often equivalent to the English &quot;as a ...&quot;, or of something being expressed in terms of another thing
:* = &quot;as a child&quot;, &quot;when (I) was a child&quot;
:* = &quot;as water&quot;
:* = &quot;in small pieces&quot;
:* = &quot;How much is five Euros in Dollars?&quot;
:* = &quot;it is full&quot;
:The essive is also used for the time when something takes place, but not for clock time:
:* = &quot;tomorrow&quot;
:* = &quot;on Monday&quot;
:* = &quot;on the 6th of December&quot; (Finnish independence day).
:* = &quot;this year&quot;
:* = &quot;this morning&quot;
(Note that for months, the inessive case is used instead)
:In ancient Finnish, essive had a locative sense, which can still be seen in some words, one special case being words expressing comparative location:
:* = &quot;at home&quot; (&quot;koto&quot; being an archaic form of &quot;koti&quot;, still current in some dialects)
:* = &quot;outside; out of doors&quot;
:* = &quot;behind (something)&quot;
:* = &quot;nearer&quot;
:* = &quot;closer to the shore&quot;
:* = &quot;further west&quot;

=== Translative ===
Characteristic ending -ksi added to the weak vowel stem. The ending is -kse- before a possessive suffix.
:This is the counterpart of the essive, with the basic meaning of a change of state. Examples:
:* = &quot;paint it red&quot;
:* = &quot;I feel tired&quot;.
:* = &quot;it turned into water&quot;
:Also has a meaning similar to English &quot;for a ...&quot;
:* &quot;mäki on englanniksi &#x27;hill&#x27;&quot; = (literally:) &quot;&#x27;hill&#x27; is English for mäki&quot;
:* = &quot;for the time being&quot;, &quot;for now&quot;
:* = &quot;plans for Friday&quot;
:* = &quot;ready by Friday&quot;
:* = &quot;what do you do for a living?&quot;
:Rarely indicates location (going somewhere):
:* = &quot;(moving) nearer to&quot;
:* = &quot;closer to the shore&quot;
:* = &quot;further west&quot;

=== Instructive ===
Characteristic ending -n added usually (but not always) to plural stem.
:This has the basic meaning of &quot;by means of&quot;. It is a comparatively rarely used case, mostly used in fixed expressions and with a very few exceptions always in the plural.
:* = &quot;with (my) own eyes&quot;
:* = &quot;by hand&quot;
:* = &quot;decorated with jewels&quot;
:* = &quot;side by side&quot;
:* = &quot;by foot&quot;
:Many common adverbs have the form of a word in the instructive case, but these have developed into independent words
:* = &quot;rarely&quot;
:* = &quot;well&quot;
:* = &quot;thus&quot;
:The instructive also occurs in some fixed phrases in an adverbial sense
:* = &quot;on average&quot;
:* = &quot;in low spirits&quot;
:It is also used with verbal second infinitives to mean &quot;by ...ing&quot;, for example
:* = &quot;by flying&quot;, &quot;by air&quot;

=== Abessive ===
Characteristic ending .
:This has the basic meaning of &quot;without&quot;. This case is rarely used by itself, especially in the spoken language, but is found in some expressions and proverbs.
:* = &quot;who grows up without discipline, dies without honor&quot;
:However, abessive is quite common in combination with the third infinitive (-ma-, -mä-).
:* = &quot;without eating&quot;
:* = &quot;without doing&quot;
:* = &quot;without taking into account...&quot;

=== Comitative ===
Characteristic ending (plus a possessive suffix for nouns but not for adjectives). This ending is added to the plural stem, even if the noun is singular, which may cause ambiguity.

:This is a rarely used case, especially in the spoken language. The meaning is companionship: &quot;in the company of&quot; or affiliation: &quot;together with&quot;, but stressing less importance than the main character.

:* = &quot;The house with its books&quot; or &quot;book&quot;
:* = &quot;The president arrived with his beautiful wife&quot; or &quot;wives&quot;
:* = &quot;Happy Easter! Wishes Matti with his family&quot; or &quot;Matti with his family wishes a happy easter&quot;

==Others==
===Prolative===
The prolative is almost exclusively found in a few fossilised forms in modern Finnish and is therefore not usually considered a living noun case (it is more common in Estonian but not considered a case there either). Its meaning is &quot;by way of&quot;, some common examples being
:* = &#x27;by post&#x27;
:* = &#x27;by phone&#x27;
:* = &#x27;by sea&#x27;
:* = &#x27;by indirect route&#x27;, or &#x27;in a roundabout way&#x27;
:* = &#x27;over&#x27;
:* = &#x27;past me&#x27;

==The Finnish locative system==
The Finnish language has eight locative cases, and some Eastern dialects symmetrify the system with the exessive case. These can be classified according to a three-way contrast of entering, residing in, and exiting a state, and there are three different systems of these cases. This system is similar to that of Estonian, and can be reconstructed to the Proto-Finnic locative system.

(The symbol &quot;V&quot; in the illative case denotes an epenthetic vowel, which is the preceding vowel in Finnish, e.g. , and the &quot;-h-&quot; elides between two short vowels, e.g. .)

It is immediately noticeable from the table that the &quot;exiting&quot; forms () have the same consonant as the &quot;residing&quot; forms () added with the Finnish partitive case ending . This may be traced into a Proto-Uralic ablative ending, which is preserved in what is now the partitive case. Also, the Finnish system is somewhat simpler than in the Hungarian language, where there is a separate system for &quot;to the top&quot;, &quot;on top&quot;, and &quot;off from the top&quot;.

The exessive case is not used in standard Finnish, but it is found in Savo Finnish and Karelian.

<text>Sir Francis Tanfield (born c. 1565, date of death unknown) was Proprietary governor of the South Falkland colony (in present-day Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) of Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, his cousin&#x27;s husband. Tanfield was to establish a colony at Renews and left England in 1623 with an unknown number of colonists. The settlers were harassed by migratory fishermen who used the harbour. He was the leader of the colony of South Falkland from 1623 to 1625. The colony was still in existence in 1626 when it was visited by Sir Richard Whitbourne but the settlers likely returned to England shortly afterwards. By 1630, Tanfield was back in England about to embark to Ireland on a mission for King Charles I.

The most probable identification of Tanfield is that he was the son of Clement Tanfield and his wife, Anne, of Gayton, Northamptonshire, born 1565. He was knighted in July 1603 and, in September, accompanied the new ambassador, Lord Spencer, to the court of the Duke of Württemberg, Frederick I, who was duke over what is now part of Germany.

<doc id="554559" wikidata="Q4571902" url="?curid=554559" title="Moravian University">
<text>Moravian University is a private university in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The institution traces its founding to 1742 by Moravians, descendants of followers of the Bohemian Reformation under John Amos Comenius.

Moravian Church Settlements — Bethlehem was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2024. This designation includes two Moravian University buildings: the Second Single Brethren&#x27;s House and the Widows&#x27; House, both situated on the campus&#x27; south side along Church Street.

Moravian University&#x27;s rich academic traditions continue today in these historic spaces. The Second Single Brethren’s House now serves as a hub for musical education and celebration, while the Widow&#x27;s House provides residential facilities for the school’s faculty and staff.

Founded as a girls school in 1742, the college itself was founded as the &quot;Moravian College and Theological Seminary&quot; in 1807 and was accredited in 1863. In 2021, the college was elevated to a University. Moravian University uses the foundation of the Girls school as their foundation date which would make them the sixth-oldest college in the United States.

==History==
Moravian University is the sixth-oldest college in the United States and the first to educate women in the original 13 colonies. It traces its roots to the Bethlehem Female Seminary, which was founded in 1742, as the second boarding school for young women in the U.S. behind just the Ursuline Academy in New Orleans. The seminary was created by Benigna, Countess von Zinzendorf, the daughter of Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, who was the benefactor of the fledgling Moravian communities in Nazareth and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Moravian Female Seminary was incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 and became the women&#x27;s college, the Moravian Seminary and College for Women in 1913.

The university also traces its roots to the founding of two boys&#x27; schools, established in 1742 and 1743, which merged to become Nazareth Hall in 1759. Located in the town of Nazareth, Nazareth Hall became, in part, Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1807. It was later incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 as a baccalaureate-granting institution, albeit with the same name. Beginning in 1858 and continuing to 1892, the seminary and college relocated from Nazareth to a former boys&#x27; school on Church Street in Bethlehem, located on the present site of the Bethlehem City Hall.

The men&#x27;s Moravian College and Theological Seminary then settled in the north end of the city (the present-day North Campus) as a result of a donation from the Bethlehem Congregation of the Moravian Church in 1888. The first buildings constructed at North Campus, Comenius Hall and Zinzendorf Hall, were completed in 1892 and joined the property&#x27;s original brick farmhouse to form the new campus. The farmhouse was later named Hamilton Hall, which still stands today.

In 1954, the two schools combined to form the single, coeducational, modern institution of Moravian College. The merger of the two institutions combined the North Campus (the location of the men&#x27;s college from 1892 to 1954) and the South Campus (the location of the women&#x27;s college) into a single collegiate campus. The distance between the North and South campuses is about of Main Street, called the &quot;Moravian Mile&quot;. First-year students traditionally walk the Moravian Mile as part of their orientation activities.

In 2021, Moravian College received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to become a university. The change to Moravian University became official on July 1, 2021.

==Academics==

Moravian University enrolls about 1,700 full-time undergraduate students and more than 500 graduate students. The seminary enrolls over 100 part-time students in its graduate divinity programs. During most semesters, at least 14 denominations are represented in the seminary student body. Faith communities most often represented among the seminary&#x27;s students include: Moravian, Lutheran, UCC, Episcopal, United Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Roman Catholic, Quaker, Mennonite, Unitarian Universalist, African Methodist Episcopal, Assembly of God, Brethren, Reformed, and nondenominational. The university&#x27;s varied and highly regarded music programs grow from the Moravian Church&#x27;s musical traditions.

Moravian University&#x27;s student news site is &quot;The Comenian,&quot; which is published online throughout the school year.

Every year, the student body elects representatives to the United Student Government. USG has a legislature, composed of 16 senators from the undergraduate body, an executive, including an elected president and vice president, appointed cabinet and staff, and a judiciary, composed of appointed justices. USG was officially recognized in 1968. Additionally, two students are elected members of Moravian University&#x27;s board of trustees; both are full, voting members and serve two-year terms.

Moravian University awards these undergraduate and graduate degrees: Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration, Master of Data Analytics, Master of Education, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Health Administration, Master of Human Resource Management, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Athletic Training. The seminary grants Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Chaplaincy, and Master of Arts in Theological Studies degrees. The university also has evening undergraduate programs for adults seeking continuing undergraduate education and graduate degrees. The seminary has accreditation from the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

Because Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Tondabayashi, Japan, have been sister cities for over half a century, Moravian University and Osaka Ohtani University (大阪大谷大学) also established a partnership. Each spring, several Japanese students come to Moravian for two weeks to take a class about the American education system. These students are hosted by Moravian students and enjoy trips to New York City and Philadelphia. During May and June 2010, the first two Moravian students studied at Osaka Ohtani University. Additionally, the university is a member of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges &amp; Universities with Muhlenberg College, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Cedar Crest College, and DeSales University; students from each institution can take classes in each other member institution and can take courses in programs offered at other institutions not offered at Moravian.

The university&#x27;s Student Opportunities for Academic Research (SOAR) program provides stipends, travel allowances, and expenses for students engaged in research or creative activities through close interaction with a faculty mentor. The program helps Moravian students gain a better understanding of scholarship in their discipline, and fosters scholar–colleague relationships. SOAR stipends can be as high as $3,000 for summer work.

Established in 1960, the university&#x27;s honors program provides qualified seniors the opportunity to pursue a yearlong intensive study of a subject of special interest.

==Campus==
The university&#x27;s programs are offered at four locations: Main Street Campus (North Campus), the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus (South Campus), the Steel Field Complex, and the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center.

===Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus===
Art and music programs are offered in Bethlehem&#x27;s historic district on the college&#x27;s Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus. Many of the buildings on that campus were built during the colonial period, including the Brethren&#x27;s House, built in 1748, which served as a hospital during the Revolutionary War, and currently houses the Music Department. Also located on Priscilla Payne Campus are the President&#x27;s House, Main Hall (1854), the Widow&#x27;s House, Clewell Hall, West Hall, South Hall, the 1867 Chapel, Clewell Dining Hall, and the Central Moravian Church. A number of the buildings are connected. The facilities have been renovated to include Payne Gallery (renovated from the original women&#x27;s gymnasium in 1903), the college&#x27;s two-level art gallery that offers several shows each year, and Foy Concert Hall. Also located on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are Peter Hall, a medium-sized recital hall, Hearst Hall, a small recital hall, and individual student rehearsal rooms and art studios. The university presents the nationally renowned Christmas Vespers services in the Central Moravian Church, located on the corner of Main and Church streets across from Brethren&#x27;s House. Many of the buildings on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are located in a National Register of Historic Places District and Church Street has been referred to as one of the most historic streets in America.

In the 2009–2010 school year, Moravian University added a new living complex on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus called the HILL. Each floor has suites, where four to 16 people can live. The complex has classrooms, a cafe, a fitness room, a mail room, and common rooms. The HILL is air conditioned and fully handicap accessible. The suites contain a living room, full kitchen, private bathroom, and additional hallway sinks. A shuttle service is provided for easy transportation between the North and South campuses.

===Main Street Campus===
Initially given in 1888 and settled in 1892, the North Campus is also known as the Main Street campus, as it is physically larger and is the site of the majority of the university&#x27;s buildings, academic departments, administration, and student residences. The main building of the Main Street Campus is Comenius Hall, which was built in 1892 and is named for John Amos Comenius, the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren, known as the &quot;father of modern education&quot; for his revolutionary educational principles. Comenius wrote in 1632, &quot;not the children of the rich or of the powerful only, but of all alike, boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and hamlets, should be sent to school&quot;. The Moravians had considered schools secondary in importance only to churches. A statue of Comenius, which was a gift to the college from Charles University of Prague and the Moravian Church of Czechoslovakia, stands in front of Comenius Hall. The Main Street Campus is also the location of Reeves Library, Priscilla Payne Hurd Academic Complex, Colonial Hall, the Bahnson Center, the Moravian Archives, Zinzendorf Hall, Borhek Chapel, Prosser Auditorium (capacity 300, inside the Haupert Union Building), Monocacy Hall, Collier Hall of Science, the Sally Miksiewiecz Center for Health Sciences, Hamilton Hall, Memorial Hall, Benigna Hall, Johnston Hall (capacity 1,600 for athletics, 3,000 for events), the Timothy M. Breidegam Athletic and Recreation Center, the Collier Hall of Science, the Haupert Union Building, the Arena Theatre, and most of the university&#x27;s student housing, including dorms, townhouses, and apartments.

In 2016, John Makuvek Field was installed and opened behind the Haupert Union Building. John Makuvek Field is a synthetic-turf field that is home to the Greyhounds&#x27; field hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams. The field is named for John Makuvek, who retired in 1996 after four years as athletics director, and in 2010 after 43 years as head golf coach. The field is located at the center of campus, with views from the residential halls, Reeves Library, and the portico of the Haupert Union Building (HUB), which has been razed and will re-open in August 2025 as a $42 million state-of-the-art student center with student mental and physical wellness central to the building design.

In 2017, the Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz Center for Health Sciences was opened at 1107 Main Street. The 55,000-square-foot facility hosts classes for both undergraduate and graduate programs, including nursing, informatics, and the health sciences and features the region&#x27;s only virtual cadaver lab. The building is named in honor of former Moravian College trustee Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz.

Also located on the Main Street Campus is the Betty Prince field hockey field.

===Steel Field Complex===

Most of the university&#x27;s athletic fields are located at this complex, including the football stadium with a grandstand capacity of 2,400 and Sportexe turf field, eight-lane Mondo Super X Performance synthetic track, the softball field, the Gillespie baseball field, the Hoffman tennis courts, the football practice fields, and a fieldhouse.

Steel Field and its brick grandstand were originally built by Bethlehem Steel to host the Bethlehem Steel Football Club, 1913 to 1930. In 1925, Lehigh University purchased Steel Field from Bethlehem Steel. The Bethlehem Steel Soccer Club continued to use the field until its demise. In 1962, Lehigh sold the facility to Moravian University.

==Athletics==
The university is a member of the NCAA and competes in Division III sports. Moravian University is a founding member of the Landmark Conference; members include Elizabethtown College, Susquehanna University, Catholic University, Drew University, Goucher College, Juniata College, and the University of Scranton.

Men&#x27;s sports include football, lacrosse, soccer, basketball, baseball, track and field, cross country, tennis, golf, and swimming. Women&#x27;s sports include softball, basketball, soccer, field hockey, track and field, volleyball, tennis, lacrosse, golf, cross country, and swimming.

== A UNESCO World Heritage Site ==
On July 26, 2024, Moravian Church Settlements—Bethlehem became the 26th UNESCO World Heritage site in the United States. Along with Gracehill, Northern Ireland, and Herrnhut, Germany, Bethlehem joins Christiansfeld, Denmark as a single World Heritage site that represents the outstanding universal value of these historic settlements and the worldwide influence of the Moravian Church.

Bethlehem&#x27;s historic sites include the Colonial Industrial Quarter, Central Moravian Church&#x27;s places of worship, the city of Bethlehem, and Moravian University.

The Second Single Brethren’s House, built in 1748 at the end of West Church Street on the axis of Main Street, is the most impressive example of 18th-century Moravian Church Civic Baroque in the US (today it is part of Moravian University).

The district also includes two buildings — the Waterworks pump house and the Gemeinhaus (community hall)  — both previously recognized as historic landmarks on their own.

<doc id="554572" wikidata="Q5633437" url="?curid=554572" title="HMS Morecambe Bay (K624)">
<text>HMS &quot;Morecambe Bay was a anti-aircraft [[frigate]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]], named after [[Morecambe Bay]] on the north western coast of England. In commission from 1949 until 1956, she saw active service in the [[Korean War]], and was sold to Portugal in 1961 to serve asNRP &quot;Dom Francisco de Almeida until 1970.

==Construction==
The ship was originally ordered from William Pickersgill &amp; Sons Ltd. of Southwick, Sunderland, on 19 January 1943 as the &quot;Loch Heilen&quot;. However, the contract was then changed, and the ship was laid down on 30 April 1944 to a revised design as a Bay class. Admiralty Job No. J4802 (Yard No. 266) was launched as &quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; on 1 November 1944. Work on the ship was suspended in August 1945 after the cessation of hostilities, and she ship was laid up at the builder&#x27;s yard. Finally, in 1948, the ship was towed to the shipyard of J. Samuel White at Cowes, where she was completed.

==Service history==

===Malaya===
&quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; was commissioned on 22 February 1949 under the command of Lieutenant-Commander K.R.S Leadley. However, post-war demobilisation meant that there was a shortage of personnel, and it was not until July that she had her full complement. In August she was detailed to serve with the Far East Fleet under the command of Commander C.C.B. Mackenzie, and sailed for Malta in September. She exercised with Mediterranean Fleet ships in October, before sailing to Singapore, arriving on 21 November to join the 4th Frigate Flotilla (later the 4th Frigate Squadron) in patrols and anti-insurgent operations on the coast of Malaya during the Malayan Emergency.

===Korea===
On the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 &quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; was nominated for service with the United Nations Naval Task Force based at Sasebo, Japan. She was deployed in October for bombardment and patrol duties off the west coast of Korea with other Commonwealth ships, including sister ship , and the New Zealand frigates and . In November she was deployed with Task Group 95.13 in minesweeping operations off the west coast, and in December was deployed in support of evacuation of Inchon with CTG 95.12, while under the command of Commander J.J.E. Famol. In January 1951 she left Korean waters and rejoined the flotilla at Hong Kong for Yangtze Patrol and flotilla exercises.

In June &quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; began her second operational tour off Korea, supporting raids by Korean troops in the Haeju and Chojin area. In July she was attached to United States Navy Task Group 95.12 to assist in bombardments off the east coast of Korea supporting allied troops ashore, receiving a congratulatory signal from the Commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin. She was then transferred to the Royal Navy Task Group on the west coast, and employed in operations off the Han River with the frigates and &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; in support of military operations to ensure access to Seoul, and in shore bombardments. Relieved from UN duties &quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; rejoined the flotilla in September for further anti-insurgent patrol duties, then refitted at Singapore in December.

In January 1952 she carried out patrols of the Malacca Strait and supported of anti-insurgent operations. In February she sailed to Sasebo for her third operational UN tour, deployed with CTG 95.22 in the Sonjin and Chojin areas off the east coast. In July Commander J.A.H. Hamer took command, and she sailed in August to Sasebo for her fourth Korean tour. In September she was deployed off the west coast for island patrols and support, then off the East coast in October, and returned to Hong Kong in November.

&quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; returned to Korea in May 1953, and while operating off Ch&#x27;o do Island off the west coast of North Korea with a US Navy Landing Ship, came under enemy fire, while counter-fire was provided by the battleship . In June she provided a guard for the rededication of War Grave cemetery at Kobe in Japan. In August her tour in Korea ended and she sailed to Hong Kong to refit. After exercises, she was deployed as guardship at Pangyong Do from 31 October, and carried out patrol and gunfire support duties. On 9 December she was relieved by the destroyer and took passage to Kure, then to Hong Kong for fleet exercises.

In January 1954 she was deployed in operations and patrols off Malaya, taking part in fleet exercises in February, before sailing to Hong Kong for maintenance, and a new CO, Commander A.C. Tupper. In April she patrolled the Pearl River, and the Formosa Strait, returning to Korea at the end of May for patrol and guardship duties, before returning to Singapore for a major refit in July, during which the crew were temporarily transferred to HMS &quot;Terror&quot; – the naval barracks at Singapore Naval Base.

===West Indies===
In September, after a shakedown cruise off Singapore, &quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; sailed for the Caribbean to join the West Indies Squadron, calling at Yokosuka, Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, San Diego, Acapulco, Puerto San José, Guatemala, and Balboa, Panama, before transiting the Panama Canal on 20 December, arriving at Kingston, Jamaica three days later.

In January 1955 she joined the cruisers and the Canadian &quot;Quebec&quot;, the frigates and , and other NATO warships for exercises, then returned to the UK, arriving back at Portsmouth on 2 February. After an extensive refit she was put back in commission on 31 July for service on America and West Indies Station under the command of Commander T.C. Meyrick. After trials and weapons calibration she sailed for Bermuda, arriving on 30 September. In October and November she visited various Caribbean island ports, then in December she took part in joint exercises with the cruiser and ships of the United States.

The year 1956 was spent in an extensive series of visits to ports in Central America, and of the United States, as well as a major multi-national exercise in June with USN, RN, Canadian and Dutch ships. Finally, in September, &quot;Morecambe Bay&quot; returned to the UK, was decommissioned on 19 November 1956.

===Sold to Portugal===
On 9 May 1961 the frigate was sold to Portugal. She served until scrapped in September 1970.

<doc id="554578" wikidata="Q62943" url="?curid=554578" title="Maurya Empire">
<text>The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power in South Asia with its power base in Magadha. Founded by Chandragupta Maurya around c. 320 BCE it existed in loose-knit fashion until 185 BCE. The primary sources for the written records of the Mauryan times are partial records of the lost history of Megasthenes in Roman texts of several centuries later, the Edicts of Ashoka, which were first read in the modern era by James Prinsep after he had deciphered the Brahmi and Kharoshthi scripts in 1838, and the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, a work first discovered in the early 20th century, and previously attributed to Chanakya, but now thought to be composed by multiple authors in the first centuries of the common era. Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW).

Through military conquests and diplomatic treaties, Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Nanda dynasty and extended his suzerainty as far westward as Afghanistan below the Hindu Kush and as far south as the northern Deccan; however, beyond the core Magadha area, the prevailing levels of technology and infrastructure limited how deeply his rule could penetrate society. During the rule of Chandragupta&#x27;s grandson, Ashoka (ca. 268–232 BCE), the empire briefly controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the subcontinent excepting the deep south. The Mauryan capital (what is today Patna) was located in Magadha; the other core regions were Taxila in the northwest; Ujjain in the Malwa Plateau; Kalinga on the Bay of Bengal coast; and the precious metal-rich lower Deccan plateau. Outside the core regions, the empire&#x27;s geographical extent was dependent on the loyalty of military commanders who controlled the armed cities scattered within it. 

The Mauryan economy was helped by the earlier rise of Buddhism and Jainism—creeds that promoted nonviolence, proscribed ostentation, or superfluous sacrifices and rituals, and reduced the costs of economic transactions; by coinage that increased economic accommodation in the region; and by the use of writing, which might have boosted more intricate business dealings. Despite profitable settled agriculture in the fertile eastern Gangetic plain, these factors helped maritime and river-borne trade, which were essential for acquiring goods for consumption as well as metals of high economic value. To promote movement and trade, the Maurya dynasty built roads, most prominently a chiefly winter-time road—the Uttarapath—which connected eastern Afghanistan to their capital Patliputra during the time of year when the water levels in the intersecting rivers were low and they could be easily forded. Other roads connected the Ganges basin to Arabian Sea coast in the west, and precious metal-rich mines in the south.

The population of South Asia during the Mauryan period has been estimated to be between 15 and 30 million. The empire&#x27;s period of dominion was marked by exceptional creativity in art, architecture, inscriptions and produced texts, but also by the consolidation of caste in the Gangetic plain, and the declining rights of women in the mainstream Indo-Aryan speaking regions of India. After the Kalinga War in which Ashoka&#x27;s troops visited much violence on the region, he embraced Buddhism and promoted its tenets in edicts scattered around South Asia, most commonly in clusters along the well-traveled road networks. He sponsored Buddhist missionaries to Sri Lanka, northwest India, and Central Asia, which played a salient role in Buddhism becoming a world religion, and himself a figure of world history. As Ashoka&#x27;s edicts forbade both the killing of wild animals and the destruction of forests, he is seen by some modern environmental historians as an early embodiment of that ethos. In July 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, the interim prime minister of India, proposed in the Constituent Assembly of India that Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath be the State Emblem of India, and the 24-pointed Buddhist Wheel of Dharma on the capital&#x27;s drum-shaped abacus the central feature of India&#x27;s national flag. The proposal was accepted in December 1947.

== Etymology ==
The domains of Ashoka are addressed as 𑀚𑀁𑀩𑀼𑀤𑀻𑀧 &quot;Jaṃbudīpa&quot; in his edicts. This term, meaning &quot;island/continent of jambu&quot;, is the common name for the entire Indian subcontinent in ancient Indian sources. Neighbouring cultures usually adressed this land by a variety of exonyms, such as the Greek (, derived from the Indus River), which gave most European languages the common name for the subcontinent, including English. Both of these terms are, however, more geographical than political, and in common parlance could include areas outside of the Mauryan control.

The name &quot;Maurya&quot; does not occur in any of the Edicts of Ashoka, or the contemporary Greek accounts such as Megasthenes&#x27;s &quot;Indica&quot;, but it is attested by the following sources:

*The Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman (c. 150 CE) prefixes &quot;Maurya&quot; to the names Chandragupta and Ashoka.
* The Puranas (c. 4th century CE or earlier) use Maurya as a dynastic appellation.
* The Buddhist texts state that Chandragupta belonged to the &quot;Moriya&quot; clan of the Shakyas, the tribe to which Gautama Buddha belonged.
* The Jain texts state that Chandragupta was the son of an imperial superintendent of peacocks (&quot;mayura-poshaka&quot;).
*Tamil Sangam literature also designate them as &quot; and mention them after the Nandas
*Kuntala inscription (from the town of Bandanikke, North Mysore) of 12th century AD chronologically mention Maurya as one of the dynasties which ruled the region.

According to some scholars, Kharavela&#x27;s Hathigumpha inscription (2nd-1st century BCE) mentions era of Maurya Empire as Muriya Kala (Mauryan era), but this reading is disputed: other scholars—such as epigraphist D. C. Sircar—read the phrase as mukhiya-kala (&quot;the principal art&quot;).

According to the Buddhist tradition, the ancestors of the Maurya kings had settled in a region where peacocks (&quot;mora&quot; in Pali) were abundant. Therefore, they came to be known as &quot;Moriyas&quot;, literally meaning, &quot;belonging to the place of peacocks&quot;. According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (&quot;Peacock-city&quot;), which was so called, because it was built with the &quot;bricks coloured like peacocks&#x27; necks&quot;.

The dynasty&#x27;s connection to the peacocks, as mentioned in the Buddhist and Jain traditions, seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. For example, peacock figures are found on the Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh and several sculptures on the Great Stupa of Sanchi. Based on this evidence, modern scholars theorise that the peacock may have been the dynasty&#x27;s emblem.

Some later authors, such as Dhundhi-raja (an 18th-century commentator on the &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; and an annotator of the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;), state that the word &quot;Maurya&quot; is derived from Mura and the mother of the first Maurya emperor. However, the Puranas themselves make no mention of Mura and do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties. Dhundiraja&#x27;s derivation of the word seems to be his own invention: according to the Sanskrit rules, the derivative of the feminine name Mura (IAST: Murā) would be &quot;Maureya&quot;; the term &quot;Maurya&quot; can only be derived from the masculine &quot;Mura&quot;.

==History==

===Sources===
The primary sources for the written records of the Mauryan times are partial records of the lost history of Megasthenes in Roman texts of several centuries later; and the Edicts of Ashoka, which were first read in the modern era by James Prinsep after he had deciphered the Brahmi and Kharoshthi scripts in 1838. The &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, a work first discovered in the early 20th century, and previously attributed to Kautilya, but now thought to be composed by multiple authors in the first centuries of the common era, has lost its value as a source for Mauryan times, as it describes post-Mauryan customs.

===Chandragupta Maurya===
The origins of the Maurya Empire are shrouded in legend. Greek sources refer to confrontations between the Greeks and Chandragupta Maurya, but are almost silent on his conquest of the Nanda Empire. Indian sources, on the other hand, only narrate the conquest of the Nanda Empire, and provide no info on what happened at the Greek frontier.

A number of Indian accounts, such as the Gupta-era drama &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; by Vishakhadatta, describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family. A kshatriya clan known as the Mauryas are referred to in the earliest Buddhist texts, Mahāparinibbāna Sutta. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. 

Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as &quot;Sandrokottos&quot;. Plutarch states that Chandragupta, as a young man, saw Alexander. 

====Unrest and warfare in the Punjab====

Alexander the Great was leading his Indian campaigns and ventured into Punjab. His army mutinied at the Beas River and refused to advance farther eastward when confronted by another army. Alexander returned to Babylon and re-deployed most of his troops west of the Indus River. Soon after Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BCE, his empire fragmented into independent kingdoms ruled by his generals.

The Roman historian Justin (2nd c. CE) states, in &quot;Epit. 15.4.12-13&quot;, that after Alexander&#x27;s death, Greek governors in India were assassinated, liberating the people of Greek rule. This revolt was led by Chandragupta, who in turn established an oppressive regime himself &quot;after taking the throne&quot;:
Raychaudhuri states that, according to Justin &quot;Epitome&quot; 15.4.18–19, Chandragupta organised an army. He notes that early translators interpreted Justin&#x27;s original expression as &quot;body of robbers&quot;, but states Raychaudhuri, the original expression used by Justin may mean mercenary soldier, hunter, or robber. Mookerji refers to McCrindle as stating that &quot;robbers&quot; refers to the people of the Punjab, &quot;kingless people.&quot; Mookerju further quotes Rhys Davids, who states that &quot;it was from the Punjab that Chandragupta recruited the nucleus of the force with which he besieged and conquered Dhana-Nanda.&quot; According to Nath Sen, Chandragupta recruited and annexed local military republics such as the Yaudheyas that had resisted Alexander&#x27;s Empire. 

When Alexander&#x27;s remaining forces were routed, returning westwards, Seleucus I Nicator fought to defend these territories. Not many details of the campaigns are known from ancient sources. Seleucus was defeated and retreated into the mountainous region of Afghanistan.

====Conquest of the Nanda Empire====

The Nanda Empire ruled the Ganges basin and some adjacent territories. The Nanda Empire was a large, militaristic, and economically powerful empire due to conquering the mahajanapadas. 

Historically reliable details of Chandragupta&#x27;s campaign against the Nanda Empire are unavailable, and legends written centuries later are inconsistent. Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu texts claim Magadha was ruled by the Nanda dynasty, which was defeated and conquered by Chandragupta Maurya, with Chanakya&#x27;s counsel. The conquest was fictionalised in the Gupta-era play &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; , which embellished the legend with further narratives not found in earlier versions of the Chanakya-Chandragupta legend. Because of this difference, Thomas Trautmann suggests that most of it is fictional or legendary, without any historical basis. Radha Kumud Mukherjee similarly considers Mudrakshasa play without historical basis.

Justin reports that Chandragupta met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape. According to several Indian legends, Chanakya travelled to Pataliputra, Magadha, the capital of the Nanda Empire where Chanakya worked for the Nandas as a minister. However, Chanakya was insulted by the King Dhana Nanda when he informed them of Alexander&#x27;s invasion. Chanakya swore revenge and vowed to destroy the Nanda Empire. He had to flee in order to save his life and went to Taxila, a notable center of learning, to work as a teacher. On one of his travels, Chanakya witnessed some young men playing a rural game practising a pitched battle near Vinjha forest. One of the boys was none other than Chandragupta. Chanakya was impressed by the young Chandragupta and saw imperial qualities in him as someone fit to rule.

The Buddhist &quot;Mahavamsa Tika&quot; and Jain &quot;Parishishtaparvan&quot; records Chandragupta&#x27;s army unsuccessfully attacking the Nanda capital. Chandragupta and Chanakya then began a campaign at the frontier of the Nanda empire, gradually conquering various territories on their way to the Nanda capital. He then refined his strategy by establishing garrisons in the conquered territories, and finally besieged the Nanda capital Pataliputra. There Dhana Nanda accepted defeat. In contrast to the easy victory in Buddhist sources, the Hindu and Jain texts state that the campaign was bitterly fought because the Nanda dynasty had a powerful and well-trained army. These legends state that the Nanda emperor was defeated, deposed and exiled by some accounts, while Buddhist accounts claim he was killed. With the defeat of Dhana Nanda, Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire.

Historically reliable details of Chandragupta&#x27;s campaign into Pataliputra are unavailable and the legends written centuries later are inconsistent. While his victory, and ascencion of the throne, is usually dated at ca. 322-319 BCE, which would put his war in the Punjab after his ascencion, an ascencion &quot;between c.311 and c.305 bc&quot; is also possible, placing his activity in the Punjab at ca. 317 BCE, &quot;at the time Seleucos was preparing future glory&quot;:
====Dynastic marriage-alliance with Seleucus====

Seleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian satrap of the Asian portion of Alexander&#x27;s former empire, conquered and put under his own authority eastern territories as far as Bactria and the Indus{{efn-la|{{blockquote|Appian, &quot;History of Rome&quot;, &quot;The Syrian Wars&quot; 55: &quot;Always lying in wait for the neighbouring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, &#x27;Seleucid&#x27; Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, Tapouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia after that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus.}}

In 303-302 BCE a confrontation took place between Chandragupta and Seleucus I Nicator, when Seleucus crossed the Indus with an army. Appian| &quot;History of Rome&quot;, The Syrian Wars: &quot;He (Seleucus) crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Maurya], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship.

Possibly without entering into a real battle, the two rulers concluded a dynastic marriage alliance in ca. 302 BCE. According to Kosmin, &quot;Seleucus transferred to Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom the easternmost satrapies of his empire, certainly Gandhara, Parapamisadae, and the eastern parts of Gedrosia, and possibly also Arachosia and Aria as far as Herat.&quot;{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=33}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;ceded_territory&quot;}} Seleucus I received 500 war elephants, that were to have a decisive role in his victory against western Hellenistic kings at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BCE.{{sfn|R. C. Majumdar|2003|p=105}} a military asset which would play a decisive role at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BCE:{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=37}} 
{{blockquote|After having made a treaty with him (Sandrakotos) and put in order the Orient situation, Seleucos went to war against Antigonus.|Junianus Justinus|&quot;Historiarum Philippicarum, libri XLIV&quot;, {{usurped|1=XV.4.15}}}}

In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to Chandragupta, and later Deimakos to his son Bindusara, at the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar). Later, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt and contemporary of Ashoka, is also recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court.{{better source needed|date=August 2016}}

Megasthenes in particular was a notable Greek ambassador in the court of Chandragupta Maurya.{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=38}} His book &quot;Indika&quot; is a major literary source for information about the Mauryan Empire. According to Arrian, ambassador Megasthenes (c. 350 – c. 290 BCE) lived in Arachosia and travelled to Pataliputra. Megasthenes&#x27; description of Mauryan society as freedom-loving gave Seleucus a means to avoid invasion, however, underlying Seleucus&#x27; decision was the improbability of success. In later years, Seleucus&#x27; successors maintained diplomatic relations with the Empire based on similar accounts from returning travellers.

Classical sources have also recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta and Seleucus exchanged presents, such as when Chandragupta sent various aphrodisiacs to Seleucus:{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=35}}
{{blockquote|And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of wondrous efficacy in such matters [as to make people more amorous]. And Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to some of the presents which Sandrakottus, the king of the Indians, sent to Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love.|Athenaeus of Naucratis, &quot;The deipnosophists&quot;, Book I, chapter 32}}

====Chandragupta&#x27;s state====
Chandragupta established a decentralised state{{efn-la|name=&quot;map_network_model&quot;}} with an administration at Pataliputra, which, according to Megasthenes, was &quot;surrounded by a wooden wall pierced by 64 gates and 570 towers.&quot;{{efn-la|In contrast to the &quot;Athashastra&quot;, which prescribes stone defences.}} Aelian, although not expressly quoting Megasthenes nor mentioning Pataliputra, described Indian palaces as superior in splendor to Persia&#x27;s Susa or Ecbatana. The architecture of the city seems to have had many similarities with Persian cities of the period.

According to Plutarch, Chandragupta Maurya subdued all of India, and Justin also observed that Chandragupta Maurya was &quot;in possession of India&quot;. These accounts are corroborated by Tamil Sangam literature which mentions about Mauryan invasion with their south Indian allies and defeat of their rivals at Podiyil hill in Tirunelveli district in present-day Tamil Nadu.

===Bindusara===
{{Main|Bindusara}}
Bindusara was born to Chandragupta, the founder of the Mauryan Empire. This is attested by several sources, including the various Puranas and the &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot;.{{sfn|Srinivasachariar|1974|p=lxxxvii}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}} He is attested by the Buddhist texts such as &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot; and &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; (&quot;Bindusaro&quot;); the Jain texts such as &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot;; as well as the Hindu texts such as &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; (&quot;Vindusara&quot;). According to the 12th century Jain writer Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Parishishta-Parvan&quot;, the name of Bindusara&#x27;s mother was Durdhara. Some Greek sources also mention him by the name &quot;Amitrochates&quot; or its variations.{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=35}}{{sfn|Alain Daniélou|2003|p=108}}

Historian Upinder Singh estimates that Bindusara ascended the throne around 297 BCE.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=331}} Bindusara, just 22 years old, inherited a large empire that consisted of what is now, Northern, Central and Eastern parts of India along with parts of Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Bindusara extended this empire to the southern part of India, as far as what is now known as Karnataka. He brought sixteen states under the Mauryan Empire and thus conquered almost all of the Indian peninsula (he is said to have conquered the &#x27;land between the two seas&#x27; – the peninsular region between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea). Bindusara did not conquer the friendly Tamil kingdoms of the Cholas, ruled by King Ilamcetcenni, the Pandyas, and Cheras. Apart from these southern states, Kalinga (modern Odisha) was the only kingdom in India that did not form part of Bindusara&#x27;s empire.{{sfn|Sircar|1971|p=167}} It was later conquered by his son Ashoka, who served as the Viceroy of Avantirastra during his father&#x27;s reign, which highlights the importance of the province.

Bindusara&#x27;s life has not been documented as well as that of his father Chandragupta or of his son Ashoka. Chanakya continued to serve as prime minister during his reign. According to the medieval Tibetan scholar Taranatha who visited India, Chanakya helped Bindusara &quot;to destroy the nobles and kings of the sixteen kingdoms and thus to become absolute master of the territory between the eastern and western oceans&quot;.{{sfn|Alain Daniélou|2003|p=109}} During his rule, the citizens of Taxila revolted twice. The reason for the first revolt was the maladministration of Susima, his eldest son. The reason for the second revolt is unknown, but Bindusara could not suppress it in his lifetime. It was crushed by Ashoka after Bindusara&#x27;s death.

Chandragupta&#x27;s son Bindusara extended the rule of the Mauryan empire towards southern India. The famous Tamil poet Mamulanar of the Sangam literature described how areas south of the Deccan Plateau which comprised Tamilakam was invaded by the Mauryan Army using troops from Karnataka. Mamulanar states that Vadugar (people who resided in Andhra-Karnataka regions immediately to the north of Tamil Nadu) formed the vanguard of the Mauryan Army.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=331}} He also had a Greek ambassador at his court, named Deimachus.{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=32}} 

Bindusara maintained friendly diplomatic relations with the Hellenic world. Deimachus was the ambassador of Seleucid king Antiochus I at Bindusara&#x27;s court.{{sfn|S. N. Sen|1999|p=142}} Diodorus states that the king of Palibothra (Pataliputra, the Mauryan capital) welcomed a Greek author, Iambulus. This king is usually identified as Bindusara.{{sfn|S. N. Sen|1999|p=142}} Pliny states that the Ptolemaic king Philadelphus sent an envoy named Dionysius to India. According to Sailendra Nath Sen, this appears to have happened during Bindusara&#x27;s reign.{{sfn|S. N. Sen|1999|p=142}}

His son Bindusara &#x27;Amitraghata&#x27; (Slayer of Enemies) also is recorded in Classical sources as having exchanged presents with Antiochus I:{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=35}}
{{blockquote|text=But dried figs were so very much sought after by all men (for really, as Aristophanes says, &quot;There&#x27;s really nothing nicer than dried figs&quot;), that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to Antiochus, entreating him (it is Hegesander who tells this story) to buy and send him some sweet wine, and some dried figs, and a sophist; and that Antiochus wrote to him in answer, &quot;The dry figs and the sweet wine we will send you; but it is not lawful for a sophist to be sold in Greece. |author=Athenaeus |title=&quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; XIV.67}}

Unlike his father Chandragupta (who at a later stage converted to Jainism), Bindusara believed in the Ajivika religion. Bindusara&#x27;s guru Pingalavatsa (Janasana) was a Brahmin of the Ajivika religion. Bindusara&#x27;s wife, Empress Subhadrangi was a Brahmin also of the Ajivika religion from Champa (present Bhagalpur district). Bindusara is credited with giving several grants to Brahmin monasteries (&quot;Brahmana-bhatto&quot;).

Historical evidence suggests that Bindusara died in the 270s BCE. According to Upinder Singh, Bindusara died around 273 BCE.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=331}} Alain Daniélou believes that he died around 274 BCE.{{sfn|Alain Daniélou|2003|p=109}} Sailendra Nath Sen believes that he died around 273–272 BCE, and that his death was followed by a four-year struggle of succession, after which his son Ashoka became the emperor in 269–268 BCE.{{sfn|S. N. Sen|1999|p=142}} According to the &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot;, Bindusara reigned for 28 years. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, which names Chandragupta&#x27;s successor as &quot;Bhadrasara&quot;, states that he ruled for 25 years.

As a young prince, Ashoka ({{reign|272|232}} BCE) was a brilliant commander who crushed revolts in Ujjain and Taxila. As emperor he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire&#x27;s superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of Kalinga (262–261 BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Ashoka used Kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession. Although Ashoka&#x27;s army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and citizen militias, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Imperial Mauryan soldiers. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of Buddhism, and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries. He also propagated his own &quot;dhamma.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Ashoka implemented principles of &quot;ahimsa&quot; by banning hunting and violent sports activity and abolishing slave trade. While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40 years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealised figure of inspiration in modern India.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as Afghanistan and as far south as Andhra (Nellore District), Ashoka&#x27;s edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in Greek, and one in both Greek and Aramaic. Ashoka&#x27;s edicts refer to the Greeks, Kambojas, and Gandharas as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka&#x27;s having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the Hellenistic world at the time such as &quot;Amtiyoko&quot; (Antiochus II Theos), &quot;Tulamaya&quot; (Ptolemy II), &quot;Amtikini&quot; (Antigonos II), &quot;Maka&quot; (Magas) and &quot;Alikasudaro&quot; (Alexander II of Epirus) as recipients of Ashoka&#x27;s proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory &quot;600 yojanas away&quot; (1 yojana being about 7 miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000 miles).

===Subhagasena (206 BCE)===
Sophagasenus was an Indian Mauryan ruler of the 3rd century BCE, described in ancient Greek sources, and named Subhagasena or Subhashasena in Prakrit. His name is mentioned in the list of Mauryan princes,{{citation needed|date=June 2007}} and also in the list of the Yadava dynasty, as a descendant of Pradyumna. He may have been a grandson of Ashoka, or Kunala, the son of Ashoka. He ruled an area south of the Hindu Kush, possibly in Gandhara. Antiochos III, the Seleucid king, after having made peace with Euthydemus in Bactria, went to India in 206 BCE and is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there:
{{blockquote|text=He (Antiochus) crossed the Caucasus and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him.|author=Polybius |title=The Histories, 11.39}}

===Decline===
Ashoka was followed for 50 years by a succession of weaker emperors. He was succeeded by Dasharatha Maurya, who was Ashoka&#x27;s grandson. None of Ashoka&#x27;s sons could ascend to the throne after him. Mahinda, his firstborn, became a Buddhist monk. Kunala Maurya was blinded and hence couldn&#x27;t ascend to the throne; and Tivala, son of Karuvaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Little is known about another son, Jalauka.

The empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by Samprati, Kunala&#x27;s son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, Brihadratha Maurya, was killed by his general, Pushyamitra Shunga in a military parade without any heir, giving rise to the Shunga Empire.

Reasons advanced for the decline include the succession of weak emperors after Ashoka Maurya, the partition of the empire into two, the growing independence of some areas within the empire, such as that ruled by Sophagasenus, a top-heavy administration where authority was entirely in the hands of a few persons, an absence of any national consciousness, the pure scale of the empire making it unwieldy, and invasion by the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.

Some historians, such as Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri, have argued that Ashoka&#x27;s pacifism undermined the &quot;military backbone&quot; of the Maurya empire. Others, such as Romila Thapar, have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been &quot;grossly exaggerated&quot;.{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=131, 143}}

====Persecution of Buddhists====
Buddhist records such as the Ashokavadana write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for Buddhists, and a resurgence of Hinduism.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}} According to Sir John Marshall, Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as Etienne Lamotte and Romila Thapar, among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.

====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BCE)====
{{Main|Demetrius I&#x27;s invasion of India}}
The fall of the Mauryas left the Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius capitalised on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180 BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalinga are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, named Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70 BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Military ==
Megasthenes mentions military command consisting of six boards of five members each, (i) Navy (ii) Military transport (iii) Infantry (iv) Cavalry and Catapults (v) Chariot divisions and (vi) Elephants.

==Administration==
===Provinces===
Ashoka&#x27;s empire consisted of five parts.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=68}} Magadha, with the imperial capital at Pataliputra, and several former mahajanapadas next to it formed the center, which was directly ruled by the emperor&#x27;s administration.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=68}} The other territories were divided into four provinces, ruled by princes who served as governors.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=68}} From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are Tosali (in the east), Ujjain (in the west), Suvarnagiri (in the south), and Taxila (in the northwest). The head of the provincial administration was the &quot;Kumar&quot; (prince), who governed the provinces as emperor&#x27;s representative. The &quot;kumara&quot; was assisted by &quot;mahamatyas&quot; (great ministers) and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his &quot;Mantriparishad&quot; (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. The Mauryans established a well developed coin minting system. Coins were mostly made of silver and copper. Certain gold coins were in circulation as well. The coins were widely used for trade and commerce{{sfn|Sen|1999|p=160}}

===Network of core areas and trade routes===
Monica Smith notes that historiography has tended to view ancient states as vast territories, whereas they are better understood as networks of centers of power, a model that also applies to the Maurya Empire.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} Kulke and Rothermunf agree with her approach, noting that Ashoka&#x27;s inscriptions reveal a regional pattern, demarcating the five parts of the empire, whereas the major rock edicts have only been found in the frontier provinces, but are absent in the centre.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=70}} Inscriptions and rock edicts are entirely absent in large parts of the territories supposedly under control of the empire, which means that &quot;large parts of present Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh as well as Kerala and Tamil Nadu were not actually included in the Maurya empire.&quot;{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=70}} Controlling the main trade routes was essential for the empire, as they were threatened by undefeated tribes inhabiting large parts of the interior.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=70}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;map_network_model&quot;}}

===Monarchical ownership===
Under the Mauryan system there was no private ownership of land as all land was owned by the emperor to whom tribute was paid by the labouring class. In return the emperor supplied the labourers with agricultural products, animals, seeds, tools, public infrastructure, and stored food in reserve for times of crisis.{{sfn|Boesche|2003|p=67–70}} The economy of the empire has also been described as &quot;a socialized monarchy&quot;, &quot;a sort of state socialism&quot;, and the world&#x27;s first welfare state.{{sfn|Boesche|2003|p=67–70}}

=== Local government ===
Arthashastra and Megasthenes accounts of Pataliputra describe the intricate municipal system formed by Maurya empire to govern its cities. A city counsel made up of thirty commissioners was divided into six committees or boards which governed the city. The first board fixed wages and looked after provided goods, second board made arrangement for foreign dignitaries, tourists and businessmen, third board made records and registrations, fourth looked after manufactured goods and sale of commodities, fifth board regulated trade, issued licences and checked weights and measurements, sixth board collected sales taxes. Some cities such as Taxila had autonomy to issue their own coins. The city counsel had officers who looked after public welfare such as maintenance of roads, public buildings, markets, hospitals, educational institutions etc. The official head of the village was &quot;Gramika&quot; and in towns and cities was &quot;Nagarika&quot;. The city counsel also had some magisterial powers. The taking of census was regular process in the Mauryan administration. The village heads (&quot;Gramika&quot;) and mayors (&quot;Nagarika&quot;) were responsible enumerating different classes of people in the Mauryan empire such as traders, agriculturists, smiths, potters, carpenters etc. and also cattle, mostly for taxation purposes.{{better source needed|reason=ToI is not a reliable source for history; also see |date=January 2023}} These vocations consolidated as castes, a feature of Indian society that continues to influence the Indian politics till today.

===Bureaucracy===
Historians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by Chanakya in the Arthashastra: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defence of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the Iron Age. According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.{{sfn|R. C. Majumdar|2003|p=107}} A vast espionage system collected intelligence for both internal and external security purposes. Having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism, Ashoka nevertheless continued to maintain this large army, to protect the Empire and instil stability and peace across West and South Asia.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.Even though large parts were under the control of Mauryan empire the spread of information and imperial messages was limited since many parts were inaccessible and were situated far away from capital of empire.

==Economy==
{{see also|Economic history of India|Coinage of India}}

For the first time in South Asia, political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a centrally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Mauryas also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Under the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka&#x27;s reign, an international network of trade expanded. The Khyber Pass, on the modern boundary of Pakistan and Afghanistan, became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the Malay Peninsula into Southeast Asia. India&#x27;s exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organisations similar to corporations. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.

==Religion==
While Brahmanism was an important religion throughout the period of the empire,{{sfn|Nath Sen|1999|p=164, (215) 217}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;Brahmanism&quot;}} the Mauryan Empire was centered in the non-Vedic Magadha realm, and favoured Jainism,{{sfn|Smith|1981|p=99}}{{sfn|Dalrymple|2009}}{{sfn|Keay|1981|p=85-86}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;Jainism&quot;}} Buddhism,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2020|p=68}}{{sfn|Long|2020|p=255}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;Buddhism&quot;}} and Ajivikism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2020|p=68}}{{sfn|Long|2020|p=255}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;Ajivikism&quot;}} Brahmanism, which had developed in the conquered Kuru-Panchala realm, lost its privileges, which threatened its very existence, and pressured it to transform itself into a &quot;socio-political ideology&quot; which eventually became influential far beyond the confines of its original homeland,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2011}}{{efn-la|name=&quot;Bronkhorst_Brahmanical_transformation&quot;|{{harvtxt|Bronkhorst|2011}}:
* This incorporation into a larger empire, first presumably by the Nandas, then by the Mauryas, took away all the respect and privileges that Brahmins had so far enjoyed, and might have meant the disappearance of Brahmins as a distinct group of people. The reason [110] why this did not happen is that Brahmanism reinvented itself. Deprived of their earlier privileges, Brahmins made an effort to find new ways to make themselves indispensable for rulers, and to gain the respect of others.&quot;
* &quot;It [118] was because of the Maurya empire that Brahmanism had to reinvent itself. It was because of that empire that Brahmanism transformed itself from a ritual tradition linked to local rulers in a relatively restricted part of India into a socio-political ideology that succeeded in imposing itself on vast parts of South and Southeast Asia, together covering an area larger than the Roman empire ever had.&quot;}} resulting in the Hindu synthesis in which Brahmanical ideology, local traditions, and elements from the sramana-traditions, were synthesised.
While according to Greek traveller Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya sponsored Brahmanical rituals and sacrifices, according to a Jain text from the 12th century, Chandragupta Maurya followed Jainism after retiring, when he renounced his throne and material possessions to join a wandering group of Jain monks and in his last days, he observed the rigorous but self-purifying Jain ritual of santhara (fast unto death), at Shravana Belgola in Karnataka,{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=39-41}}{{sfn|Romila Thapar|2004|p=178}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=64-65}}{{sfn|Samuel|2010|pp=60}} though it is also possible that &quot;they are talking about his great grandson.&quot; Samprati, the grandson of Ashoka, patronised Jainism. Samprati was influenced by the teachings of Jain monks like Suhastin and he is said to have built 125,000 derasars across India.{{sfn|John Cort|2010|p=142}} Some of them are still found in the towns of Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Ujjain, and Palitana.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} It is also said that just like Ashoka, Samprati sent messengers and preachers to Greece, Persia and the Middle East for the spread of Jainism, but, to date, no evidence has been found to support this claim.{{sfn|John Cort|2010|p=199}}


The Buddhist texts &quot;Samantapasadika&quot; and &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; suggest that Bindusara followed Brahmanism, calling him a &quot;Brahmana bhatto&quot; (&quot;devotee of the Brahmins&quot;).

Magadha, the centre of the empire, was also the birthplace of Buddhism. In later life Ashoka followed Buddhism; following the Kalinga War, he renounced expansionism and aggression. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka, whose king Tissa was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to West Asia, Greece and South East Asia, and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as Sanchi and Mahabodhi Temple, and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in Afghanistan and Thailand. Ashoka helped convene the Third Buddhist Council of India&#x27;s and South Asia&#x27;s Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.

==Society==
The population of South Asia during the Mauryan period has been estimated to be between 15 and 30 million. According to Tim Dyson, the period of the Mauryan Empire saw the consolidation of caste among the Indo-Aryan people who had settled in the Gangetic plain, increasingly meeting tribal people who were incorporated into their evolving caste-system, and the declining rights of women in the Indo-Aryan speaking regions of India, though &quot;these developments did not affect people living in large parts of the subcontinent.&quot;

==Architectural remains==
{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi|Mauryan art}}
The greatest monument of this period, executed in the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, was the old palace at Paliputra, modern Kumhrar in Patna. Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been a group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of Megasthenes, the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.{{better source needed|date=August 2016}} Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
During the Ashokan period, stonework was of a highly diversified order and comprised lofty free-standing pillars, railings of stupas, lion thrones and other colossal figures. The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of Buddhist architecture. Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several stupas, which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at Sanchi, Bodhgaya, Bharhut, and possibly Amaravati Stupa. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the Ashoka pillars and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the Indian subcontinent.{{better source needed|date=August 2016}}

The peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka&#x27;s pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=15}}

==Natural history==

The protection of animals in India was advocated by the time of the Maurya dynasty; being the first empire to provide a unified political entity in India, the attitude of the Mauryas towards forests, their denizens, and fauna in general is of interest.

The Mauryas firstly looked at forests as resources. For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these played a role in the defeat of Seleucus, one of Alexander the Great&#x27;s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them.

The Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the &quot;Protector of Animals&quot; also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or &quot;aranyaca&quot; to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.

When Ashoka embraced Buddhism in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate conservation measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the emperor&#x27;s example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:
{{blockquote|Our king killed very few animals.|Edict on Fifth Pillar}}

However, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 &#x27;panas&#x27; (coins) fine for poaching deer in imperial hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.

==Contacts with the Hellenistic world==
===Greek population in India===
An influential and large Greek population was present in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under Ashoka&#x27;s rule, possibly remnants of Alexander&#x27;s conquests in the Indus Valley region. In the Rock Edicts of Ashoka, some of them inscribed in Greek, Ashoka states that the Greeks within his dominion were converted to Buddhism:

{{blockquote|Here in the king&#x27;s dominion among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods&#x27; instructions in Dharma.|(Rock Edict Number 13)}}
{{blockquote|Now, in times past (officers) called Mahamatras of morality did not exist before. Mahdmatras of morality were appointed by me (when I had been) anointed thirteen years. These are occupied with all sects in establishing morality, in promoting morality, and for the welfare and happiness of those who are devoted to morality (even) among the Greeks, Kambojas and Gandharas, and whatever other western borderers (of mine there are).|(Rock Edict Number 5)}}

Fragments of Edict 13 have been found in Greek, and a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic, has been discovered in Kandahar. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word Eusebeia (&quot;Piety&quot;) as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous &quot;Dharma&quot; of his other Edicts written in Prakrit:{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}

{{blockquote|Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (&quot;εὐσέβεια&quot;, Eusebeia) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting. And if some (were) intemperate, they have ceased from their intemperance as was in their power; and obedient to their father and mother and to the elders, in opposition to the past also in the future, by so acting on every occasion, they will live better and more happily. |Trans. by G.P. Carratelli {{usurped|}} {{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}}}

===Buddhist missions to the West (c. 250 BCE)===

Also, in the Edicts of Ashoka, Ashoka mentions the Hellenistic kings of the period as recipients of his Buddhist proselytism, although no Western historical record of this event remains:

{{blockquote|The conquest by Dharma has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni (Sri Lanka). |Edicts of Ashoka, 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika.{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}}}

Ashoka also encouraged the development of herbal medicine, for men and animals, in their territories:
{{blockquote|Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi&#x27;s [Ashoka&#x27;s] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as Tamraparni and where the Greek king Antiochos rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals. |2nd Rock Edict{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}}}

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the spread of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (&quot;Yona&quot;) Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}).

{{efn|name=&quot;Ajivikism&quot;|Ajivikism:
* {{harvtxt|Bronkhorst|2020|p=68}}: &quot;The brahmanized regions of north-western India were now governed by rulers who had no sympathy for Brahmins or their sacrificial culture, and whose natural sympathies lay with the religions of Greater Magadha, primarily Jainism, Jivikism, and Buddhism.&quot;}} 


{{efn-la|name=&quot;Boesche_2003_assassination&quot;|{{harvtxt|Boesche|2003}}, referring to Radha Kumud Mookerji, &quot;Chandragupta Maurya and His Times&quot;, 4th ed. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1988 [1966]), 31, 28-33: &quot;Just after Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 B.C.E., Chandragupta and Kautilya began their conquest of India by stopping the Greek invaders. In this effort they assassinated two Greek governors, Nicanor and Philip, a strategy to keep in mind when I later examine Kautilya&#x27;s approval of assassination. &quot;The assassinations of the Greek governors,&quot; wrote Radha Kumud Mookerji, &quot;are not to be looked upon as mere accidents.&quot;&quot;}}

{{efn|name=&quot;Brahmanism&quot;|While {{harvtxt|Nath Sen|1999|p= 164, (215) 217}} states (p.164) &quot;During the Mauryan period Brahmanism was an important religion&quot; (Nath Sen distinguishes Brahmanism from Hinduism; p. (215) 217: [At the time of Chandragupta II (ca. 380-415 CE) of the Gupta Empire] [...] [i]n place of the old sacrificial Brahmanism, Hinduism had appeared&quot;). Others strongly disagree:
* {{harvtxt|Thapar|1960}}: &quot;...the Mauryas did not conform to the accepted religion of most royal families of the time, Brahmanism.&quot;
* {{harvtxt|Bronkhorst|2011}}: 
:* &quot;We know that Aśoka’s personal leanings were toward Buddhism, and tradition testifies to the fact that all the other rulers of the Maurya empire had strong links with Jainism, sometimes Ajivikism, but never with Brahmanism. A persistent tradition maintains that Candragupta was a Jaina.&quot;
:* &quot;The picture that is slowly gaining ground in modern research is that the establishment of the Maurya empire spelt disaster for traditional Brahmanism. Brahmins in earlier days performed rituals at the courts of kings in the Brahmanical heartland. This Brahmanical heartland was conquered by rulers from Pāṭaliputra, who had no respect for Brahmanical rituals and needed no Brahmins at their courts.&quot;
:* &quot;the region of Magadha had not been brahmanized at the time of Candragupta.&quot;
* {{harvtxt|Bronkhorst|2020|p=68}}: &quot;The brahmanized regions of north-western India were now governed by rulers who had no sympathy for Brahmins or their sacrificial culture, and whose natural sympathies lay with the religions of Greater Magadha, primarily Jainism, Jivikism, and Buddhism.&quot;
* {{harvtxt|Omvedt|2003|p=119}} &quot;Magadha was considered by Brahmanic literature to be a &quot;mleccha&quot; (barbarian) land where Vedic sacrifices and Brahmanic rituals were not performed.}}

{{efn|name=&quot;Buddhism&quot;|Buddhism:
* {{harvtxt|Bronkhorst|2020|p=68}}: &quot;The brahmanized regions of north-western India were now governed by rulers who had no sympathy for Brahmins or their sacrificial culture, and whose natural sympathies lay with the religions of Greater Magadha, primarily Jainism, Jivikism, and Buddhism.&quot;}}

{{efn-la|name=&quot;core_regions&quot;|{{harvtxt|Stein|Arnold|2010|p=73}}: &quot;at present what is taken to be the realm of Ashoka is a discontinuous set of several core regions separated by very large areas occupied by relatively autonomous peoples. Four core regions have been identified as belonging to Ashoka’s time, in addition to the kingdom’s heartland in the eastern Gangetic plain around Pataliputra; each of these was apparently under the authority of close kin or servants of Ashoka himself: Taxila in the foothills of the Hindu Kush; Ujjain on the Malwa plateau; Kalinga extending southward along the east coast from the Ganges delta; and Suvarnagiri, in modern Karnataka, in the centre of the lower Deccan Plateau.&quot;}}
{{efn|name=&quot;Dyson2018-lead-maurya&quot;|{{harvtxt|Dyson|2018|pp=16–17}}: &quot;Magadha power came to extend over the main cities and communication routes of the Ganges basin. Then, under Chandragupta Maurya (c.321–297 bce), and subsequently Ashoka his grandson, Pataliputra became the centre of the loose-knit Mauryan &#x27;Empire&#x27; which during Ashoka&#x27;s reign (c.268–232 bce) briefly had a presence throughout the main urban centres and arteries of the subcontinent, except for the extreme south.&quot;}}
{{efn-la|name=&quot;Iori_2023_maintenance&quot;|{{harvtxt|Iori|2023|p=184, 219}}: &quot;At the end of the farming year when the land was free of crops (end of October–April) and the water level low, it was the time for maintenance activities (e.g., clearing of wells and water infrastructure) and the time when manpower could be invested in other production and building activities both in rural and urban contexts. But above all, this was the time for movement and trade. The uttarāpatha, that is the main road linking eastern Afghanistan to India through the cities of Kabul, Charsadda, and Taxila down to Patna, is indeed a winter road typically used when local rivers (Kabul, Indus, and the rivers of Punjab) are at their lowest levels, so that they can be easily forded (Olivieri 2020: 645–646).}}
{{efn|name=&quot;Jainism&quot;|Jainism:
* {{harvtxt|Smith|1981|p=99}}: &quot;the only direct evidence throwing light [...] is that of Jain tradition [...] it may be that he [Chandragupta] embraced Jainism towards the end of his reign [...] after much consideration I am inclined to accept the main facts as affirmed by tradition [...] no alternative account exists.&quot;
* {{harvtxt|Dalrymple|2009}}: &quot;It was here, in the third century BC, that the first Emperor of India, Chandragupta Maurya, embraced the Jain religion and died through a self-imposed fast to the death.&quot;}}
{{efn-la|name=&quot;limited_control&quot;|{{harvtxt|Fisher|2018|p=72}}: &quot;Chandragupta’s many military and diplomatic conquests extended his overlordship further than any previous Indian ruler: from Afghanistan to Bengal and from the Himalayas down into the northern Deccan. But his administration lacked the technology and infrastructure to penetrate very deeply into society outside of Magadha.&quot;}}



{{efn-la|name=&quot;Roy_2012a_p28_changes&quot;|{{harvtxt|Roy|2012a|p=28}}: &quot;This period is noted for three important changes. One change was the rise of religions that advocated nonviolence, thereby reducing sacrifices and expensive rituals. The emphasis on a frugal lifestyle and peaceful neighborly relations suited the mercantile temperament. Not surprisingly, merchants were the principal sponsors of these religions. Settlement sites have been found in the middle-Ganges plains for this earliest period of known commerce that indicate the presence of long-distance trade. A second change was the introduction of coinage in the sixth century BCE, which promoted regional monetary integration. The third change was the increasing use of writing, which may have indirectly helped long-distance and complex economic transactions.5 This process of change was centered in the eastern Gangetic plains, where settled agriculture had given rise to powerful landed communities yet where access to the sea and to river-borne trade remained the principal means of procuring precious metals and consumption goods. States, therefore, chose to sponsor merchants and the religion of the merchants, Buddhism. The Mauryan Empire revealed a combination of all of these elements: commerce, religion, agriculture, and coinage.&quot;}}
{{efn-la|name=&quot;territorial_extent&quot;|Territorial extent:
* {{harvtxt|Ludden|2013|p=47}}: &quot;IMPERIAL BHARAT The Mauryas defined an ancient territory called Bharat. Marching along old trade routes, the empire acquired the geometrical shape of a tall triangle with a broad base, with its apex in Magadha. One long northern leg ran west up the Ganga, across Punjab, into the Hindu Kush; and one long leg ran south-west from Pataliputra, up the Son river valley, down the Narmada River into Berar, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. The broad base spanned Punjab, the Indus, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and western Maharashtra. The northwestern frontier revolved around Gandhara and Kashmir; the south-western frontier around Nasika, now Nasik, in Maharashtra. North of Kashmir and west of the Khyber Pass, Greek dynasties held sway. South of Nasika, the Mauryan presence consisted primarily of diplomatic missions.&quot;
* {{harvtxt|Stein|Arnold|2010|p=73}}: &quot;In 305 BCE one of his successors attempted a reinvasion but was so fiercely resisted that he was forced to conclude a treaty with Chandragupta that accepted the latter’s sovereignty south of the Hindu Kush range.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;}}

<doc id="554587" wikidata="Q923672" url="?curid=554587" title="HMS New Zealand (1911)">
<text>HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot; was one of three s. Launched in 1911, the ship was funded by the government of New Zealand as a gift to Britain, and she was commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1912. She had been intended for the China Station, but was released by the New Zealand government at the request of the Admiralty for service in British waters.

During 1913, &quot;New Zealand&quot; was sent on a ten-month tour of the British Dominions, with an emphasis on a visit to her namesake nation. She was back in British waters at the start of the First World War, and operated as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Grand Fleet, in opposition to the German High Seas Fleet. The battlecruiser participated in all three of the major North Sea battles—Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank, and Jutland—and was involved in the response to the inconclusive Raid on Scarborough, and the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. &quot;New Zealand&quot; contributed to the destruction of two cruisers and was hit by enemy fire only once, sustaining no casualties; her status as a &quot;lucky ship&quot; was attributed by the crew to a Māori piupiu (warrior&#x27;s skirt) and hei-tiki (pendant) worn by the captain during battle.

After the war, &quot;New Zealand&quot; was sent on a second world tour, this time to allow Admiral John Jellicoe to review the naval defences of the Dominions. In 1920, the battlecruiser was placed in reserve. She was broken up for scrap in 1922 to meet the United Kingdom&#x27;s tonnage limit in the disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design==
The &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class was not a significant improvement on the preceding ; the main difference was the enlargement of the dimensions to give the ships&#x27; two wing turrets a wider arc of fire. The ships were smaller and not as well protected as the contemporary German battlecruiser and subsequent German designs. While &quot;Von der Tann&quot;″s characteristics were not known when the lead ship of the class, , was laid down in February 1909, the Royal Navy obtained accurate information on the German ship before work began on &quot;New Zealand&quot; and her sister ship .

&quot;New Zealand&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship displaced at load and at deep load. She initially had a crew of 818 officers and ratings, though this was to increase in subsequent years. At the time of her visit to New Zealand in 1913 the engineering department had a staff of 335.

The ship was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 31 coal-burning Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . However, during trials in 1912, the turbines produced over , which allowed &quot;New Zealand&quot; to reach . The ship carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a speed of .

The ship carried eight BL 12-inch Mk X guns in four twin gun turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: &#x27;P&#x27; was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while &#x27;Q&#x27; was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had a limited ability to fire to the opposite side, but if the ship was full broadside to her target she could bring all eight main guns to bear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4-inch BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two 18-inch (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each side aft of &#x27;X&#x27; barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.

The &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between and covered the end barbettes. Their armoured deck ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.

&quot;New Zealand&quot;″s &#x27;A&#x27; turret was fitted with a rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament in the event that the normal fire control positions were knocked out or communication between the primary positions and the gun layers was disabled.

The ship was fitted with a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss anti-aircraft (AA) gun from October 1914 to the end of 1915. In March 1915, a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun was added. It was provided with 500 rounds. The battlecruiser&#x27;s 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. Two aft guns were removed at the same time.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; received a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship&#x27;s roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently.

To address deficiencies in the armour of British capital ships raised by the Battle of Jutland, &quot;New Zealand&quot; entered the dockyard in November 1916 where an additional inch of armour was added to selected horizontal areas of the main deck. In the forward part of the ship it covered the magazines for A-turret and the 4-inch guns; midships to cover the magazines for Q- and P-turrets, while it was extended vertically by to protect the magazine trunks and escape shafts. During a refit in June 1917 the armour was again improved when 1-inch armour plate was added on the lower deck at the bottom of the inner and outer upper coal bunkers as well as over the boiler.

By 1918, &quot;New Zealand&quot; carried two aircraft, a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter, on flying-off ramps fitted on top of &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets. The Pup was intended to shoot down Zeppelins while the 1½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.

===Post-war modifications===
In preparation for its role as Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s personal transport for his planned visit to Australia, Canada, India and New Zealand &quot;New Zealand&quot; was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919. The fore topmast and both top gallants were replaced. Her flying-off platforms were removed and new peacetime trim was installed. The range clocks were removed and the deflection scales on the turrets were painted over. The lower forward four-inch guns were removed and replaced with cabins on the port and starboard sides of the forward superstructure to house Jellicoe and provide offices for his staff of eight.

==Acquisition and construction==

At the start of the 20th century, the British Admiralty maintained that naval defence of the British Empire, including the Dominions, should be unified under the Royal Navy. Attitudes on this matter softened during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of Fleet Units: forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. While Australia and Canada were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies, other fleet units would be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the Far East; New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the China Station.

To this end, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir Joseph Ward, announced on 22 March 1909 that his country would fund a battleship (later changed to an ) as an example to other countries. It is unclear why this design was selected, given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the Imperial German Navy (). Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy&#x27;s practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from the United Kingdom, or it might have reflected the preferences of the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher, preferences not widely shared. The New Zealand Government took out a loan to fund the cost of the ship.

When it came to naming the new ship the most obvious name was already being used by the existing King Edward VII-class battleship HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot;. It was decided to transfer the name to the new battlecruiser and to rename the older ship. Among the suggested names were &quot;Arawa&quot;, &quot;Caledonia&quot;, &quot;Wellington&quot; and &quot;Maori&quot; (which was already being used by a destroyer, and thus would have required a double renaming) being floated before &quot;Zealandia&quot; was eventually decided upon and subsequently approved by the King.

===Construction===
Wright has identified that the Controller of the Admiralty John Jellicoe had wanted to have &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; constructed by the same shipbuilder. This would have reduced construction costs and simplified administration. Tenders were issued early in 1910, but of those who were prepared to tender, all were only prepared to construct one vessel. Both Australia and New Zealand for unknown reasons agreed to accept that of John Brown &amp; Company which was highest of the two successful tenders, but the former signalled its acceptance first, leaving New Zealand to accept that of Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering. The estimated cost of Fairfield&#x27;s offer was £1.8 million, which included the guns and the first issue of ammunition. Fairfield had already built HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot;, which would have given them confidence in their cost estimate, which included all stores including first coal and ammunition. In the end John Brown &amp; Company delivered &quot;Australia&quot; well under their original tendered price.

&quot;New Zealand&quot;″s keel was laid at Fairfield&#x27;s yard on the Clyde on 20 June 1910. The construction contract was between the Admiralty and Fairfield (using the Admiralty&#x27;s standard contract terms) and was overseen by the Admiralty with manufacturer&#x27;s payment claims being approved and then passed on by the Admiralty to the New Zealand High Commission&#x27;s office in London. Variation claims were often individually itemised (such as £1. 12s. 6d. for a specific drawing) and passed on for payment, with some payments still being processed as late as the 1914–15 financial year. The ship was built with all stores supplied from the Admiralty at the &quot;Rate Book&quot; price plus 20 per cent, with exception of the coal. The Admiralty did not charge New Zealand for its management of the project. Fairfield&#x27;s share of the contract made a profit of £50,454 (6 per cent).

The four main gun mountings were made by Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s Elswick Ordnance Works, at a cost of £207,593 (excluding delivery and assembly) while the guns were supplied by both Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers. The twenty-two 12-inch guns (including six spares) and thirty-six 4-inch guns (including four spares) required to equip both of the Dominion&#x27;s ships cost a combined total of £249,550.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; was launched on 1 July 1911 in front of 8,000 onlookers by Lady Theresa Ward, the wife of Sir Joseph Ward, using a bottle of New Zealand wine for the christening. 
Following her launch &quot;New Zealand&quot; was moved by the Clyde Shipping Company&#x27;s tugs &quot;Flying Linnet&quot; and &quot;Flying Swallow&quot; to the shipyard&#x27;s fitting out basin, for installation of the boilers, engines, and auxiliary machinery though temporary openings in the main deck before the superstructure and armament was installed. 
The battlecruiser&#x27;s first captain, Lionel Halsey, took command on 21 September 1912. Sea trials began in October with the hull checked in dry dock on 8 October prior to a 30-hour steam test at three-quarter power being undertaken on the 9 and 10 October. Full power tests were conducted off Polperro on 14 October with 49,048 shp being generated. Over the “measured mile” she reached 25.49 knots (based on revolutions) and 26.3 knots (by bearings).

&quot;New Zealand&quot; was formally commissioned at Govan on 19 November 1912. The Admiralty required that all new ships be drydocked as part of the acceptance process to allow the completion and inspection of all underwater fittings. As Fairfield didn&#x27;t have their own drydock, the ship sailed from Govan with the nucleus of her crew to Devonport to use that shipyard&#x27;s facilities. By now the ship&#x27;s hull had spent a considerable time in Fairfield&#x27;s often polluted fitting out basin, so the hull was cleaned and then painted with a fresh anti-fouling coating.

The ship was officially completed on 23 November 1912, when she reached her nominally full complement of crew. Her officers by now included three New Zealanders, Lieutenant Alexander David Boyle, Lieutenant Rupert Clare Garsia and Midshipman Hugh Beckett Anderson, all from Christchurch.
To signal her upcoming completion the New Zealand government commissioned the marine artist William Lionel Wyllie to produce a painting of &quot;New Zealand&quot; which he titled &quot;Tower House&#x27;, Portsmouth [HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot; fitting out]&quot;. In subsequent years he also produced other paintings of the ship.

==Service history==
In December 1912 the battlecruiser began the task of working up prior to joining the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. While at sea over the 1912-13 New Year some of the masting was damaged by a storm.

===1913 circumnavigation of the world===


In 1912 it was agreed that the ship would visit its donor country as a &#x27;thank you&#x27; for funding its construction, with a basic nine month long itinerary developed in the last months of 1912. To facilitate the cruise &quot;New Zealand&quot; was temporary detached from the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron on 20 January 1913 for the duration of the voyage with Halsey having independent command. The initial date of departure progressively moved backward into 1913 with the ship finally departing the Royal Navy dockyard at Devonport on 28 January for Portsmouth which it reached two days later. On 3 February, 300 expatriate New Zealanders organized by Sir Thomas Mackenzie (New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom) visited the ship at which he unveiled the battlecruiser&#x27;s coat of arms (which had been gifted by the country&#x27;s expatriate community in the United Kingdom). This was followed by a visit by King George V accompanied by Winston Churchill and James Allen (New Zealand&#x27;s Minister of Finance and Defence) and other high–ranking officials on 5 February 1913.

As soon as the King&#x27;s party had departed &quot;New Zealand&quot; took on coal before departing Portsmouth on 6 February. There were stops at St Vincent, Ascension Island, Cape Town, Simon&#x27;s Town and Durban in South Africa and then at Melbourne in Australia before &quot;New Zealand&quot; reached Wellington, New Zealand, on 12 April. This was the start of an event that gripped the country as thousands of New Zealanders came to catch a sight of and where possible visit “our Dreadnought”. For the ship&#x27;s crew this meant having to attend a constant parade of events and festivities. After an 11-day stay in the capital &quot;New Zealand&quot; proceeded up the east coast of the North Island to visit Napier, Gisborne and Auckland, before streaming south to visit Lyttelton, Akaroa, where she exercised with HMS &quot;Pyramus&quot; before continuing on to Timaru, Otago Harbour, Bluff, Milford Sound, Greymouth, Westport, Nelson, Picton, before stopping again at Wellington. From there she proceeded up the West Coast of the North Island visiting Wanganui, Russell and back to Auckland which was reached on 21 June.

The battlecruiser received numerous gifts while in New Zealand, including a naval ensign and a union jack.
Two greenstone hei-tiki (pendants), which were intended to ward off evil were gifted to the ship. One was given by the Boy Scouts of Wellington on 13 April, and the second by Christchurch businessman C. J. Sloman in May 1913. He had deposited the hei-tiki at Canterbury Museum in 1913 and then uplifted it a few months later to lend it to the ship on the condition that it had to be returned to Canterbury Museum should the name &quot;New Zealand&quot; ever be removed from the navy list.

The most notable gift was the personal gift to Halsey of a Māori &quot;piupiu&quot; (a warrior&#x27;s skirt made from rolled flax).
According to legend the chief who gave the piupiu to Halsey instructed him to wear it during battle to protect the ship and its crew. If he did, then the ship would be involved in three sea battles; it would be hit only once; and no one on board would be killed. On many of these occasions speeches were often given in the Māori language, which may resulted in a misunderstanding about the purpose of the gift. It is unclear exactly who presented the piupiu to Halsey, as he did not record details about who it was or about any prophesy. There are a number of possibilities as to who gifted the piupiu. One is that it was given by Rotorua Māori in Auckland on 26 June. Another is that it was given by Rangitīaria Dennan in Rotorua on 7 May. This account is supported by Halsey&#x27;s daughter, which mentions meeting Dennan and a discussion with him about her father being gifted a piupiu when he made an honorary chief of the tribe. Another possibility was that the piupiu was given by the Te Arawa chief Mita Taupopoki. On 17 April a large group from Ngāti Raukawa visited the battlecruiser in Wellington at which it is recorded that “a presentation of piupiu (garments of war)” were made. Another likely candidate was that the piupiu was given to Halsey on behalf of Ngāi Tahu chief Mana Himiona Te Ataotu by Southern Māori MP, Taare Rakatauhake Parata (Charles Rere Parata) when he visited the ship in Wellington on 19 April 1913. On this occasion a piupiu was recorded as being given. A delegation of 25 leading Māori (including Māori members of parliament) did visit the battlecruiser in Wellington on 21 April among whom was Tureiti Te Heuheu Tukino V a leading chief of the Ngāti Tūwharetoa, But this occasion it was reported that “two kiwi robes, a tangiwai pendant, two korowai robes, and a kickio (&quot;carpet mat&quot;) were gifted.

As a result of this visit the officers and crew of &quot;New Zealand&quot; were to maintain a close relationship with her donor country and its citizens over her years of service and her adventures were closely followed in the Dominion&#x27;s newspapers. Though none of the crew were Māori they would occasionally perform the haka (in which they had received instruction while in New Zealand) at functions. The ship&#x27;s Māori connection was also maintained by its official letterhead paper featuring the &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, which was the Māori word for New Zealand.

By the time the battlecruiser departed New Zealand from Auckland on 28 June for Fiji, a total of 376,114 New Zealanders had visited the vessel during her time in the country, though other sources quote 376,086, 368,118. and 378,068. It is estimated that approximately another 125,000 had been able to see the ship either from the shore or from boats. At the time the country had a population of one million. The battlecruiser streamed across the Pacific via Suva, Fiji and Honolulu to dock on 23 July at the naval base of Esquimalt on Vancouver Island, Canada.
After departing Esquimalt &quot;New Zealand&quot; headed south stopping at Mazatlán, Acapulco, Panama City, Callao, Valparaíso, Punta Arenas, before she steamed through the Strait of Magellan and on to Montevideo, Rio Janeiro, then various islands of the Caribbean and finally Halifax, Nova Scotia (in Canada) before arriving in Portsmouth on 8 December 1913 having circumnavigated the globe. She had sailed 45,320 miles, consumed 31,833 tons of coal and had been visited by 500,151 people in what was the longest voyage to date by a vessel of the dreadnought era.

===Assigned to the Grand fleet===
The Admiralty requested that &quot;New Zealand&quot; return to the United Kingdom when the tour concluded, rather than remain in the Pacific region as originally planned. The New Zealand Government acceded to the request. 
As a result, upon her return to the United Kingdom, &quot;New Zealand&quot; joined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) of the Grand Fleet. The squadron visited Brest in February 1914, and Riga, Reval and Kronstadt in the Russian Empire the following June. While there they were visited by the Tsar and Tssarina on the 27 June and that evening hosted in a formal ball in conjunction with &quot;Lion&quot;, which was moored alongside.
On the 29 June the squadron departed for the United Kingdom. The intention was that &quot;New Zealand&quot; would decommission on 30 August prior to transferring to the Mediterranean fleet where she would become the flagship of Rear Admiral Archibald Moore, but the outbreak of war cancelled that deployment.

===First World War===
On 19 August 1914, shortly after the First World War began, &quot;New Zealand&quot; was transferred to the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS).

====Battle of Heligoland Bight====

&quot;New Zealand&quot;″s first wartime action was the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty&#x27;s ships were originally intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35, the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar at the mouth of the Jade estuary.

The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. By this time, &quot;New Zealand&quot; had fallen behind the three newer and faster battlecruisers and was not in position to significantly participate in the battle. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to evade fire by hiding in the mists, but &quot;Cöln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by the British squadron. Before the German ship could be sunk, Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser off his starboard bow. He turned to pursue, but &quot;Ariadne&quot; was set afire after only three salvos fired from under . At 13:10, Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Shortly after turning north, the battlecruisers encountered the crippled &quot;Cöln&quot;, which was sunk by two salvos from &quot;Lion&quot;. During the battle, &quot;New Zealand&quot;″s captain, Lionel Halsey, wore the Māori piupiu over his uniform, setting a tradition followed for the duration of the war. Two days after the battle, &quot;New Zealand&quot; was transferred back to the 1st BCS, when the battlecruiser arrived from the Mediterranean.

====Raid on Scarborough====

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was later devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment, while the rest of the High Seas Fleet stationed itself east of Dogger Bank, so they could cover the battlecruisers&#x27; return and destroy any pursuing British vessels. Having broken the German naval codes, the British were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware of the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s presence. Admiral Beatty&#x27;s 1st BCS (now reduced to four ships, including &quot;New Zealand&quot;) and the 2nd Battle Squadron (consisting of six dreadnoughts) were detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Admiral Hipper&#x27;s raiders set sail on 15 December 1914, and successfully bombarded several English towns; British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 05:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender, commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 05:40 that the destroyer was engaging enemy destroyers, although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the German armoured cruiser and her escorts at about 07:00, but could not transmit the message until 07:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did &quot;New Zealand&quot;, but Beatty, aboard &quot;Lion&quot;, did not, even though &quot;New Zealand&quot; had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and the flagship. Warrender attempted to pass on Shark&#x27;s message to Beatty at 07:36, but did not manage to make contact until 07:55. On receiving the message, Beatty reversed course, and dispatched &quot;New Zealand&quot; to search for &quot;Roon&quot;. She was being by &quot;New Zealand&quot; when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered &quot;New Zealand&quot; to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
The British forces, heading west to cover the main route through the minefields protecting the coast of England, split up while passing the shallow Southwest Patch of Dogger Bank; Beatty&#x27;s ships headed to the north, while Warrender passed to the south. This left a gap between them, through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers toward the German ships, which he presumed were the advance screen for Hipper&#x27;s ships. However, those were some behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty&#x27;s ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the north-east of the British forces and also made good their escape.

====Battle of Dogger Bank====

&quot;New Zealand&quot; became flagship of the 2nd BCS of the Grand Fleet on 15 January 1915. Eight days later, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Hipper sortied to clear Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. Alerted by decoded German transmissions, a larger force of British battlecruisers, including &quot;New Zealand&quot;, sailed under the command of Admiral Beatty to intercept. Contact was initiated at 07:20. on the 24th, when &quot;Arethusa&quot; spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35, the Germans had spotted Beatty&#x27;s force and Hipper ordered a turn south at , believing that this speed would outdistance any British battleships to the north-west; he planned to increase speed to the armoured cruiser ″s maximum of if necessary to outrun any battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practical speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. &quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; were the slowest of Beatty&#x27;s ships, and gradually fell behind the newer battlecruisers, despite &quot;New Zealand&quot; achieving an indicated speed of 27 knots due to the original overdesign of the engines and to the efforts of her stokers. Despite dropping behind, &quot;New Zealand&quot; was able to open fire on &quot;Blücher&quot; by 09:35, and continued to engage the armoured cruiser after the other British battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour, &quot;New Zealand&quot; had knocked out &quot;Blücher&quot;″s forward turret, and &quot;Indomitable&quot; began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced the German ship&#x27;s armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room four minutes later. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port turrets, while the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed dropped to , and jammed her steering gear. At 10:48, Beatty ordered &quot;Indomitable&quot; to attack her, but the combination of a signalling error by Beatty&#x27;s flag lieutenant and heavy damage to Beatty&#x27;s flagship &quot;Lion&quot;, which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards, caused the rest of the British battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in &quot;New Zealand&quot;, to think that that signal applied to them. In response, they turned away from Hipper&#x27;s main body and engaged &quot;Blücher&quot;. &quot;New Zealand&quot; fired 147 shells at &quot;Blücher&quot; before the German ship capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed by &quot;Arethusa&quot;. Other sources dispute the number of shells fired by &quot;New Zealand&quot; with Wright stating 151 shells (12 shells of common 12-inch and 139 shells of 12-inch high explosive) during the action. Halsey had again worn the piupiu over his uniform during the battle, and the lack of damage to &quot;New Zealand&quot; was once more attributed to its good luck properties.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; was relieved by &quot;Australia&quot; as flagship of the 2nd BCS on 22 February. The squadron joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in response to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and the squadron returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what they thought was a British attack. Heavy fog and the need to refuel caused &quot;Australia&quot; and the British vessels to return to port on 17 April, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. In June Halsey was promoted to Captain of the fleet with rank of Commodore on HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and was succeeded as captain of &quot;New Zealand&quot; by J.F.E. (Jimmy) Green. Despite it being his personal property Halsey left the piupiu in the care of Green.

====Collision with HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;====
On the morning of 21 April, the 2nd BCS left Rosyth at 04:00 (accompanied by the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron and destroyers) again bound for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the transport of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed to coincide with the Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point in the middle of the North Sea, with the 1st and 3rd Battlecruiser Squadrons while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. At 15:30 on the afternoon of 22 April, the three squadrons of battlecruisers were patrolling together to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down, while the ships were steaming abreast at 19.5 knots, with &quot;Australia&quot; on the port flank. Concerned about possible submarine attack Beatty issued instructions at 15:35 for the fleet to commence zigzagging. It took some time for the instruction to be relayed by signal flag down the line and so it wasn&#x27;t until 15:40 that &quot;Australia&quot; with a cruiser to her port side commenced her first zigzag and swung to starboard. The crew were aware that &quot;New Zealand&quot; was on that side about five cables (926 metres) away but the poor visibility meant that as they made their turn they didn&#x27;t see her until it was too late and they hit at 15:43, despite &quot;Australia&quot; attempting to turn away to port. &quot;Australia&quot;″s side was torn open from frames 59 to 78 by the armour plate on the hull below her sister ships P-turret, while as &quot;New Zealand&quot; turned away her outer port propeller damaged &quot;Australia&quot;&#x27;s hull below her Q-turret.

&quot;Australia&quot; slowed to half-speed as the mist hid her sister ship, but the damage to &quot;New Zealand&quot;&#x27;s propeller caused a temporary loss of control and she swung back in front of &quot;Australia&quot; which despite turning to port, had her stem crushed at 15:46 as she scraped the side of &quot;New Zealand&quot;, just behind her P-turret. Both ships to come to a complete stop about apart while their respective officers assessed the damage. The damage control teams on the &quot;Australia&quot; were soon busy storing up bulkheads and sealing off the damage portions to prevent any more water entering the ship. Meanwhile off watch Australian sailors took advantage of a convenient potato locker to hurl both its contents and insults at the crew of their nearby sister ship. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was soon underway, returning to Rosyth with the rest of the squadron. The same fog caused the battleship &quot;Neptune&quot; to collide with a merchant ship and the destroyers &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Garland&quot; to collide with one another.

Once it was safe to proceed &quot;Australia&quot; with her speed restricted to 12, and then later to 16 knots arrived back at Rosyth to find both drydocks occupied, one by &quot;New Zealand&quot; and the other by HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; so she departed for Newcastle-on-Tyne, where she was further damaged trying to dock during strong winds. As this facility couldn&#x27;t handle all of the repairs that it needed the battlecruiser was ordered to Devonport. &quot;Australia&quot; was not able to return to sea until 31 May, thus missing the Battle of Jutland. Meanwhile &quot;New Zealand&quot; replaced her damaged propeller with &quot;Australia&quot;&#x27;s spare propeller which was in store at Rosyth and returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland. Due to the continued absence of &quot;Australia&quot; Rear Admiral William Christopher Pakenham transferred his flag from &quot;Indefatigable&quot; to &quot;New Zealand&quot;.

====Battle of Jutland====

On 31 May 1916, the 2nd BCS consisted of its flagship &quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot;; &quot;Australia&quot; was still under repair following her collision with &quot;New Zealand&quot;. The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet, which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east-south-east to position himself astride the German&#x27;s line of retreat and called his ships&#x27; crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time, Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.

Thus began the so-called &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east-south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn, and only the two leading ships, &quot;Lion&quot; and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with &quot;Indefatigable&quot; in the rear and the furthest to the west, and &quot;New Zealand&quot; ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; aimed at Von der Tann, while &quot;New Zealand&quot;, disengaged herself, targeted . By 15:54, the range was down to and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was destroyed at about 16:03, when her magazines exploded.

After &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s loss, &quot;New Zealand&quot; shifted her fire to &quot;Von der Tann&quot; in accordance with Beatty&#x27;s standing instructions. The range had grown too far for accurate shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. By this time, the 5th Battle Squadron, consisting of four s, had closed up and was engaging &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and &quot;Moltke&quot;. At 16:23, a shell from struck near &quot;Von der Tann&quot;″s rear turret, starting a fire among the practice targets stowed there that completely obscured the ship and caused &quot;New Zealand&quot; to shift fire to &quot;Moltke&quot;. At 16:26, the ship was hit by a shell, fired by &quot;Von der Tann&quot;, on &#x27;X&#x27; barbette that detonated on contact and knocked loose a piece of armour that briefly jammed &#x27;X&#x27; turret and blew a hole in the upper deck. Four minutes later, &quot;Southampton&quot;, scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer&#x27;s battleships, but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen-point turn to starboard in succession. &quot;New Zealand&quot;, the last ship in the line, turned prematurely to stay outside the range of the oncoming battleships.
&quot;New Zealand&quot; was several times by the battleship but was not hit. Beatty&#x27;s ships maintained full speed in an attempt to increase the distance between them and the High Seas Fleet, and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then north-east to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet. At 17:40, they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and as they could not make out the British ships, they turned away to the north-east at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet in battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 18:35, Beatty was following &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-south-east, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of the High Seas Fleet in the haze. Twenty minutes later, Scheer ordered another 180° turn which put them on a converging course again with the British, which had altered course to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer&#x27;s T, forming a battle line that cut across his battle line and badly damaging his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 19:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.

This was successful, and the British lost sight of the Germans until 8:05, when spotted smoke bearing west-north-west. Ten minutes later, she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats, and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire at 20:20, followed by the rest of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. &quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; concentrated their fire on , and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage. Shortly after 20:30, the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve&#x27;s II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans had poor visibility and were able to fire only a few rounds at them before turning away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8:40. After this, Beatty changed course to south-south-east and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning, when the order was given to reverse course and head home.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; arrived back in Rosyth on 2 June and dropped anchor at 09:55. The crew had approximately 50 minutes rest before, with the potential possibly that she may have to put to sea again, they began the task of refuelling with 1,178 tons of coal and then replenishing the ammunition with 480 twelve-inch shells, work which continued until 03:30 on the following morning.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; fired 430 twelve-inch shells during the battle, 100 from A-turret, 129 from P-turret, 105 from Q-turret and 96 from X-turret, more than any other ship on either side. Despite this rate of fire, only four successful hits were credited to her: three on &quot;Seydlitz&quot; and one on the pre-dreadnought . This gave a hit rate of less than one per cent. Other than the single hit on X-turret the only other damage was from near misses and was minimal, consisting of a shell through the silk jack, a splinter hitting the ensign staff, the No.3 cutter had some damage to its bow and the No.2 picket boat was hit in three places. This confirmed to the crew that the piupiu and hei-tiki worn by Captain Green, brought good luck.

====Post-Jutland career====
&quot;New Zealand&quot; was relieved by &quot;Australia&quot; as flagship on 9 June and temporarily attached to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, until relieved her in September. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where the British expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, they turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. &quot;New Zealand&quot; underwent a refit at Rosyth in November 1916. She temporarily replaced &quot;Australia&quot; as squadron flagship between 29 November and 7 January 1917.

On 1 October 1917 Green gave up his command of the ship following a promotion to Rear-Admiral, but it wasn&#x27;t until 13 December 1917 that Captain Edward Kennedy assumed temporary command, which he held until 17 January 1918 when Richard Webb took over the permanent captain. Webb remained captain until September when he was made a rear-admiral and left to take up the role of Assistant High Commissioner at Constantinople. In the latter stages of the war a number of New Zealand soldiers on leave were able to take advantage of the open invitation extended to them by &quot;New Zealand&quot;&#x27;s captain to visit the ship.

German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were attempting to clear British-laid minefields in the Heligoland Bight in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was attached to the 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. &quot;New Zealand&quot; did not fire her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.

During 1918, &quot;New Zealand&quot; and the Grand Fleet&#x27;s other capital ships were used on occasion to escort convoys between the United Kingdom and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st BCS to support minelayers. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea from 25 June or 26 June to the end of July. During September and October, &quot;New Zealand&quot; and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney. In the former month Leonard Andrew Boyd Donaldson took over command of the ship and remained in command until 11 February 1919.

By the time of the 1918 armistice &quot;New Zealand&quot; had since August 1914 sailed 84,458 nautical miles, consumed 97,034 tons of coal and fired a total of 664 twelve-inch shells in action. As a member of the 2nd BCS the battlecruiser was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet in November 1918. To witness the event &quot;New Zealand&quot; embarked five soldiers from the New Zealand Division and a New Zealand newspaper reporter. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was assigned responsibility for checking the compliance of SMS &quot;Derfflinger&quot; with the terms of its internment.

===Post-war===
In December 1918 &quot;New Zealand&quot; was used to convey Queen Maud and Prince Olav from Norway for their state visit of the United Kingdom. With the war at an end most of the United Kingdom&#x27;s older capital ships were put into reserve, as they were by now obsolete and with the government wishing to make significant cuts in its military expenditure there was little chance of their returning to full service, especially once the formal peace treaty was signed with Germany in mid-1919. One exception was &quot;New Zealand&quot;, which it was decided would be used to transport, Admiral Jellicoe on what was to be an expected year-long visit to India and the dominions of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to assist with planning and coordinating their naval policies and defences. To prepare her for voyage, the battlecruiser was refitted between December 1918 and 11 February 1919 at the end of which she was recommissioned with a virtually all-new crew under the command of Captain Oliver Elles Leggett.

The battlecruiser departed Portsmouth on 31 February 1919 and while crossing the Bay of Biscay encountered a storm that forced the evacuation of the newly constructed accommodation for Jellicoe and his staff when it became apparent that the dockyard had failed to seal the holes in the structure. After a 24-hour stop at Gibraltar for Jellicoe to make his first official visit the battlecruiser continued onto Port Said to take on approximately 2,000 tons of coal before continuing through the Suez Canal to make a brief stop at Suez where Jellicoe rejoined it (having left it at Port Said to visit Cairo) before crossing the Arabian Sea to reach Bombay on 14 March. While Jellicoe was engaged in a week of consultations in Delhi, 1,740 tons of coal was taken on board and the opportunity was taken for the battlecruiser to be painted in the dockyard. This was completed on 22 March, just in time for the ship to host a ball three days later. The battlecruiser then made a two-day visit to Karachi before returning to Bombay. Unfortunately while in Karachi a sailor was killed after falling off a balcony while on shore. Once back in Bombay some of the crew got into trouble while on shore leave, which was cancelled in response.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; departed Bombay on 1 May for Columbo, which was reached two days later, where 1,800 tons of coal and 700 tons of oil was taken on board, in preparation for the journey across the Indian Ocean. By the 9 May the battlecruiser was in the vicinity of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the opportunity was taken to divert so that the crew could see the remains of the light cruiser SMS &quot;Emden&quot;.
The ship arrived at Albany, Western Australia, on 15 May, where Jellicoe and his staff disembarked to take an overland route across the country. &quot;New Zealand&quot; sailed via Perth, Outer Harbor (near Adelaide), Melbourne and Hobart with the opportunity taken for &quot;New Zealand&quot; to exercise with &quot;Australia&quot; and other units of the RAN prior to reaching Sydney. Here she was drydocked in Sunderland Dock at Cockatoo Island where her bottom was scraped and painted, before being refloated and coaled. The battlecruiser left Sydney on 16 August for New Zealand.

Wellington was reached on 20 August, as the influenza pandemic was rampant. As a result, the crew was subjected to a medical inspection before anyone was allowed to disembark. While in Wellington the ship was visited by approximately 50,000 New Zealanders prior to 24 August before it proceeded south to Lyttelton, which was reached on 1 September. The ship then proceeded north to anchor off Picton on 13 September where it spent two days and then after a stop in Wellington it sailed up the east coast of the North Island to reach Auckland on 22 September. Jellicoe, during the next six weeks as he visited ports throughout the country, was preparing a three-volume report for the government. The ship was particularly popular in New Zealand, with Jellicoe, the officers and crew attending numerous social engagements. The tour around the country allowed Jellicoe and his staff to familiarize themselves with the country as they prepared recommendations for the New Zealand government on its naval policy. Crowds flocked to visit the battlecruiser as they had done in 1913. Jellicoe, too, was popular and he later returned to New Zealand to serve as Governor-General from 1920 to 1924.
The battlecruiser left Auckland on 3 October, briefing stopping at Suva in Fiji and Samoa with mail, where at the latter her 12-inch guns were fired to entertain the local chiefs, then Fanning Island for (six hours) and Hawaii. Enroute the ship called upon Christmas Island (Kiritimati), southeast of Fanning Island, on 19 November 1920, thinking it uninhabited. Instead, they were greeted by Joe English, of Medford, Massachusetts, who had been manager of a copra plantation on the island, but had become marooned with two others, when the war had broken out. The men were evacuated.

The battlecruiser arrived in Canada, the final country to be assessed when it docked on 8 November and docking at Esquimalt on Vancouver Island. The Jellicoes left the ship on 20 November to tour Canada and the United States by train before re-joining it in Key West. On 11 November two rugby teams from the ship competed against local teams from Victoria. The officers played the Wanderers and the crew played V.I.A.A (Vancouver Island Athletic Association).
After leaving Vancouver the ship stopped at San Diego, before passing via the Panama Canal into the Caribbean where as well as visiting Havana time was spent in Jamaica, where exercising of the main armament was undertaken. During a stop at Port of Spain on the island of Trinidad a petty officer fell off a wharf and was drowned. Heading north the battlecruiser picked Jellicoe at Key West on 8 January 1920. The battlecruiser reached Portsmouth on 3 February having covered 33,514 nautical miles. As Jellicoe had been promoted to Admiral of the Fleet while overseas the ship was greeted by the appropriate 19-gun salute from HMS &quot;Victory&quot;.

===Put into reserve===
On 6 February &quot;New Zealand&quot; was pulled by tugs to a mooring on the Hamoaze. Most of the crew sent on six-weeks leave, with a skeleton crew of 250 remaining behind under the command of Lieutenant Commander Alexander David Boyle. Leggett gave up command of &quot;New Zealand&quot; and was succeeded by Captain Hartley Russell Gwennap Moore (1881–1953) on 11 March. Moore remained in that position until July 1921.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; was paid off into reserve on 15 March 1920. By this time the battlecruiser was regarded as obsolete by the Royal Navy, as she was coal powered and her 12-inch guns were inferior to the guns deployed on the latest generation of capital ships. She was briefly recommissioned on 1 July 1921 with a reserve crew to replace HMS &quot;Hercules&quot; as flagship at Rosyth under the command of Captain Ralph Eliot (1881–1958), who had previously been in command of &quot;Hercules&quot;. Eliot was to be the ship&#x27;s last captain, and remained in command until 1 September.

===Scrapping===
Along with all of the other British 12-inch battleships and battlecruisers it was agreed that &quot;New Zealand&quot; would be scrapped to meet the tonnage restrictions set on the British Empire by the Washington Naval Treaty.
&quot;New Zealand&quot; was sold for scrap together with &quot;Agincourt&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; to the Exeter-based electrical engineering firm of J&amp;W Purves with the proviso that they had to be demolished within 18 months of the Washington Naval Treaty being ratified. 
To meet the Admiralty&#x27;s desire to provide work for unemployed dock workers at Rosyth Dockyard the contract was immediately transferred the contract to a new entity chaired by A. Wallace Cowan (1877–1964) called the Rosyth Shipbreaking Company which would undertake the scrapping of the vessels at Rosyth. It took until 19 December 1922 to legally organize the transfer of the ships from the Royal Navy to the new company, which had among its directors Admiral J.F.E. Green who had commanded the ship at the Battle of Jutland. Leased facilities were set up adjacent to where the vessels were lying alongside a wharf on the south side of the main basin in the Naval Dockyard at Rosyth. The vessels were taken over on 25 January 1923 with work commencing first on &quot;New Zealand&quot;. By March 1923 her superstructure had been removed and she was moved out of the basin and beached above the low tide mark on a beach outside of the wall of the northwest dockyard. A large portion of &quot;New Zealand&quot;&#x27;s hull was still being dismantled in July 1924 and it wasn&#x27;t until September 1924 that the last components of &quot;New Zealand&quot; were removed from the site. And her place on the beach was taken over by the &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. Between them the three vessels yielded 40,000 tons of steel, approximately 10,000 tons of armour plate and even 3,000 tons of coal still in their bunkers.

The New Zealand government received £20,000 from the sale of the vessel and completed paying off the loan used to fund the ship in the 1944/45 financial year.

==Artifacts==
By the time of the decision to scrap &quot;New Zealand&quot; had an impressive collection of silverware and trophies (officially listed at 47 in January 1919).

As well as the above-mentioned silverware and trophies numerous other items were removed from the vessel prior to scrapping and sent back to New Zealand. Among the items were the ship&#x27;s bell, a boomerang, two greenstone mere (clubs), silver cups, gunnery shields, two hei-tiki, a complete laundry, a 42-foot long motor launch, the ship&#x27;s flags, some searchlights, a steering wheel, four 4-inch QF guns and associated rangefinders. Some furniture was sent to the High Commission in London, though they lost out on the wardroom buffet, which ended up in New Zealand&#x27;s Parliament restaurant, Bellamy&#x27;s. Most of these items arrived in New Zealand in late 1923. The ship&#x27;s former captains were sent furniture from the captain&#x27;s cabin.
The 4-inch guns, a range finder and laundry equipment, were used by military units. During the Second World War, the 4-inch guns were the main armament of the land batteries which protected the entrances to the harbours at Auckland, Wellington and Lyttelton. Two of these guns have since 23 November 1929 been located outside of the northern entrance to the Auckland War Memorial Museum. At the outbreak of World War Two, they were removed with one being returned to service while the other gun which was too damaged to repair, was placed in storage at the museum. Two guns were once again returned to display outside the museum in 1959.

On 12 December 1924 A. Wallace Cowan presented an ink stand and cigar boxes made from the ship&#x27;s timbers to New Zealand High Commissioner Sir James Allen and current New Zealand Prime Minister William Massey (who was in the United Kingdom at the time), while a third cigar box was sent to Ward. One of these cigar boxes is currently held by the Auckland Museum. Teak from the ship was used as flooring in Cowan&#x27;s house. A photo album of the breaking up of the vessel was presented by Cowan&#x27;s daughter to the New Zealand Royal Navy in 1968 and is now held by National Archives New Zealand.

Auckland War Memorial Museum has among its collection Pelorus Jack&#x27;s silver collar (a gift received from the New Zealanders of Transvaal), another brass-studded collar and his harness. Another collar, gifted by the Pretoria Public Works Department, is held by the Royal New Zealand Navy Museum, Devonport.

The other artifacts are on display in various museums in New Zealand. The hei-tiki donated by C. J. Sloman has been in the Canterbury Museum since 1932. Having once been on display in the Wellington Maritime Museum the auxiliary steering wheel and an engine telegraph are now, together with other items is in the possession of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.

Other than for when it was lent for display at the 1940 Centennial Exhibition in New Zealand the captain&#x27;s piupiu remained with Halsey until his death in 1949. His daughter Ruth bequeathed it to New Zealand upon her death in 2002 and since 2005 it has been on display at the Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Auckland alongside the ship&#x27;s bell, the wardroom buffet and other artifacts, including the piece of armour knocked off of X-turret at the Battle of Jutland. When HMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; exploded at the Battle of Jutland debris from the ship fell on &quot;New Zealand&quot;, among which was a ring-bolt. This is now in the collection of the Torpedo Bay Navy Museum.

The South Canterbury Museum in Timaru, New Zealand, holds the naval ensign which flew from &quot;New Zealand&quot; during all of its naval engagements in World War I. The naval ensign and a union jack were purchased by the women&#x27;s branch of the Navy League in Timaru and presented to the ship when it visited Timaru in May 1913.

==Ship&#x27;s mascot==

The ship&#x27;s first mascot, Pelorus Jack, was a bulldog donated by a New Zealander resident in London and named after the famous dolphin that greeted ships in the Marlborough Sounds of New Zealand. The first was &quot;discharged dead&quot; from the Navy on 24 April 1916 after falling down the forward funnel. His will requested not only that his successor be a &quot;bull pup of honest parentage, clean habits, and moral tendencies&quot;, but also that &quot;no Dachshound or other dog of Teutonic extraction&quot; be permitted on board.

His successor&#x27;s service at the Battle of Jutland caused him to become afraid of gunfire and when it was considered it was unlikely he could survive the ship&#x27;s return voyage to the United Kingdom he was discharged with the rank of leading sea dog and given to the people of Auckland in October 1919. Following six-month quarantine Jack was taken under the care of the superintendent of parks.

<text>HMS &quot;Newfoundland was a [[light cruiser]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. Named after the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]], she participated in the [[Second World War]] and was later sold to the [[Peruvian Navy]] and renamedBAP &quot;Almirante Grau.

The hospital ship was a different ship, although also torpedoed in the Mediterranean in 1943.

==Early career==
&quot;Newfoundland&quot; was built by Swan Hunter and launched 19 December 1941 by the wife of the then British Minister of Labour, Ernest Bevin. The ship was completed in December 1942 and commissioned the next month.
After commissioning &quot;Newfoundland&quot; joined the 10th Cruiser Squadron, Home Fleet. Early in 1943 the ship became flagship of the 15th Cruiser Squadron, Mediterranean. On the night of 13/14 July 1943, during Sicily Campaign, she provided effective support for 1st Parachute Brigade helping to secure the Primasole Bridge, linking Catania with Syra.

On 23 July 1943, she was torpedoed by the . Some sources attribute the torpedo to the . One crewman was killed in the attack. Her rudder having been blown off, temporary repairs were carried out at Malta. Later, steering by her propellers only, and with the assistance of &quot;jury rigged&quot; sails between her funnels, she steamed to the Boston Navy Yard for major repairs.

In 1944 the ship was re-commissioned for service in the Far East. While at Alexandria an exploding air vessel occurred in one of the torpedoes in the port tubes which caused severe damage and one casualty. The repairs delayed her arrival in the Far East for service with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF). &quot;Newfoundland&quot; went to New Guinea to support the Australian 6th Division in the Aitape-Wewak campaign. On 14 June 1945, as part of a BPF task group, &quot;Newfoundland&quot; attacked the Japanese naval base at Truk, in the Caroline Islands during Operation Inmate.

On 6 July &quot;Newfoundland&quot; left the forward base of Manus in the Admiralty Islands with other ships of the BPF to take part in the Allied campaign against the Japanese home islands. On 9 August she took part in a bombardment of the Japanese city of Kamaishi. &quot;Newfoundland&quot; was part of a British Empire force which took control of the naval base at Yokosuka.

The ship was present in Tokyo Bay when the Instrument of Surrender was signed aboard the US battleship , on 2 September 1945. &quot;Newfoundland&quot; was then assigned the task of repatriating British Empire prisoners of war.

She returned to Great Britain in December 1946.

==Postwar==
&quot;Newfoundland&quot; was initially in reserve, and was used as a training ship as part of the stokers&#x27; training establishment , before starting a 20-month reconstruction at Plymouth in 1951. The modernisation was one of the more extensive of those applied to the Colony or Town-class cruisers in the 1950s with &quot;Newfoundland&quot; receiving extensive new electrical and fire control systems, a new bridge, comprehensive nuclear spraydown capability and lattice masts, particularly for the 960 radar in a similar structure to that later fitted to the cruisers and . The integrated 275 and MRS-1 fire control for the 4 twin and 40mm mounts was the most comprehensive fitted to a modernised Royal Navy cruiser but possibly not as reliable as the simpler installations on the cruisers and &quot;Belfast&quot;.

Recommissioned on 5 November 1952, she became flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies. The cabinet of Sri Lanka met on board her during the Hartal of 1953. From December 1953 &quot;Newfoundland&quot; underwent a three-month refit at Singapore before transferring to the Far East Station, shelling Malayan National Liberation Army targets near Penang in June 1954 when on passage to the Far East.

On 31 October 1956, the was cruising South of the Suez Canal in the Red Sea, when &quot;Newfoundland&quot; encountered her and ordered her to heave to. Aware of tensions between Britain and Egypt that would lead to the Suez Crisis, &quot;Domiat&quot; refused and opened fire on the cruiser, causing some damage and casualties. The cruiser, with the destroyer , then returned fire and sank her opponent, rescuing 69 survivors from the wreckage. One man from the &quot;Newfoundland&quot; was killed and five were wounded.

&quot;Newfoundland&quot; then returned to the Far East until paid off to the reserve at Portsmouth on 24 June 1959. She was sold to the Peruvian Navy on 2 November 1959, and subsequently renamed &quot;Almirante Grau&quot; and then to in 1973. The cruiser was hulked in 1979 and used as a static training ship in Callao, before being decommissioned and scrapped later that year.

<text>Robert William Jenson (August 2, 1930 – September 5, 2017) was a leading American Lutheran and ecumenical theologian. Prior to his retirement in 2007, he spent seven years as the director of the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, NJ. He was the co-founder of the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and is known for his two-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; published between 1997 and 1999.

==Student years==
Jenson was born on August 2, 1930, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He studied classics and philosophy at Luther College in the late 1940s, before beginning theological studies at Luther Seminary in 1951. Due to a car accident he missed most of his first-year seminary studies, and during that year he immersed himself in the works of Immanuel Kant and Søren Kierkegaard. Jenson began reading historical-critical scholars like Hermann Gunkel and Sigmund Mowinckel, and as a result he became deeply interested in the biblical texts and in the theological significance of the Old Testament.

At Luther Seminary, Jenson was assistant to the renowned orthodox Lutheran theologian, Herman Preus. Preus infused Jenson with an admiration for the theology of post-Reformation Lutheran scholasticism, and with a strong belief in the orthodox Lutheran understanding of predestination. Against the majority of the staff at Luther Seminary at that time, who believed that God elected individuals to salvation on the basis of &quot;foreseen faith&quot;, Preus held that God had decreed the salvation of a definite number of the elect, without a decree of reprobation. Other influences at Luther Seminary included Edmund Smits, who introduced Jenson to the work of Augustine of Hippo, and fellow student Gerhard Forde, who introduced him to the work of Rudolf Bultmann. While studying at seminary, Jenson also met and married Blanche Rockne, who became one of the major stimuli for his theological work (one of his later books includes a dedication to Blanche, &quot;the mother of all my theology&quot;).

After seminary, Jenson taught in the department of religion and philosophy at Luther College from 1955 to 1957, before moving to Heidelberg for doctoral studies in 1957–1958. Though he had planned to write his dissertation on Bultmann, his supervisor, , advised him to work on Karl Barth&#x27;s doctrine of election. Thus Jenson worked on Barth&#x27;s theology at Heidelberg, and he also studied nineteenth-century German theology and philosophy, partly with the help of the new Heidelberg lecturer, Wolfhart Pannenberg. He also attended a seminar there with Martin Heidegger (and, during a later visit to Heidelberg, with Hans-Georg Gadamer). Even more significantly, at Heidelberg he became friends with another young Lutheran scholar, Carl Braaten, who would later become his &quot;chief theological companion&quot; and his most important theological collaborator.

==Early career==
Jenson&#x27;s doctoral dissertation (revised and published in 1963 as &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;) was completed in Basel, with Barth&#x27;s approval, and so Jenson returned to Luther College, where he continued to study Barth while also developing an increasing interest in the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel. The faculty of the religion department was uncomfortable with Jenson&#x27;s theological liberalism, and his openness to biblical criticism and evolutionary biology was strongly condemned. When the college failed to force Jenson&#x27;s retirement, several professors from the religion and biology departments resigned in protest. From 1960 to 1966, Jenson was thus left with the task of helping to rebuild an entire religion department, and he became especially involved in the development of a new philosophy department. During these years, he also wrote &quot;A Religion Against Itself&quot; (1967), which sharply critiqued the American religious culture of the 1960s.

Jenson finally left Luther College to spend three years as Dean and Tutor of Lutheran Studies at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Here he was able to focus for the first time on teaching theology, and he was deeply influenced by his encounters with Anglicanism and with ecumenical worship. The three years at Oxford marked a creative and productive period in Jenson&#x27;s career. In &quot;The Knowledge of Things Hoped For&quot; (1969), he sought to integrate the traditions of European hermeneutics and English analytical philosophy, while also drawing on patristic and medieval theologians such as Origen and Thomas Aquinas. And in &quot;God after God&quot; (1969), he sought to go beyond the &quot;death of God&quot; theology by emphasizing the actualism and futurity of God&#x27;s being. The proposal advanced in &quot;God after God&quot; was in many respects parallel to the new &quot;theology of hope&quot; that was being developed at the time in Germany by young scholars like Jürgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. At Oxford, Jenson also supervised the doctoral work of Colin Gunton, who went on to become one of Great Britain&#x27;s most distinguished and influential systematic theologians.

From Oxford, Jenson returned to America in 1968 and took up a position at the Lutheran Seminary in Gettysburg. His work here focused in part on distinctively Lutheran themes, especially in the books &quot;Lutheranism&quot; (1976) and &quot;Visible Words&quot; (1978). He also began to engage deeply with patristic thought (especially with Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Alexandria, and Maximus the Confessor), which led him to develop a creative new proposal for trinitarian theology in &quot;The Triune Identity&quot; (1982).

Further, as a result of his encounter with Anglicanism at Oxford, Jenson was appointed to the first round of Lutheran–Episcopal ecumenical dialogue in 1968. This was the beginning of his long involvement with the ecumenical movement, which would deeply shape his later theology. With George Lindbeck, he became involved in the Roman Catholic–Lutheran dialogue; and in 1988, he spent time at the Institute for Ecumenical Research at Strasbourg. Throughout his career, Jenson&#x27;s theology continued to move in an increasingly Catholic, conservative and ecumenical direction. He interacted extensively with the work of Catholic theologians like Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) and Hans Urs von Balthasar and with Eastern Orthodox theologians like Maximus the Confessor, John Zizioulas, and Vladimir Lossky.

==Later career==
After two decades of teaching at Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Jenson moved in 1988 to the religion department of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. He was joined in Northfield by his friend Carl Braaten, and together they founded the conservative Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology in 1991. The founding of this center marked a new period of intensive ecumenical involvement for Jenson: with Braaten, he organized numerous ecumenical conferences and began publishing the theological journal &quot;Pro Ecclesia&quot;, where he remained a senior editor until his death.

Jenson continued to teach at St. Olaf College until 1998, when he retired and took up a position as Senior Scholar for Research at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, New Jersey. Before leaving St. Olaf College, he completed work on his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the two-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; (1997–1999), which has since been widely regarded as one of the most important and creative recent works of systematic theology. In a review of this work, Wolfhart Pannenberg described Jenson as &quot;one of the most original and knowledgeable theologians of our time&quot;.

Jenson died in his home in Princeton on September 5, 2017.

<doc id="554592" wikidata="Q5450873" url="?curid=554592" title="Finnish conjugation">
<text>Verbs in the Finnish language can be divided into six main groups depending on the stem type, both for formal analysis and for teaching the language to non-native speakers. All six types have the same set of personal endings, but the stems assume different suffixes and undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.

The article on Finnish language grammar has more about verbs and other aspects of Finnish grammar.

==Tables of conjugation==
Tables of conjugation are given here for the regular verb, of type I (to speak), as used in the formal, written language. Verb conjugation in the everyday spoken language is somewhat different.

===Basic tenses in the indicative mood===

The present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect correspond fairly well to English: &#x27;speaks&#x27;, &#x27;spoke&#x27;, &#x27;has spoken&#x27;, and &#x27;had spoken&#x27;, respectively or in the passive voice, &#x27;it is spoken&#x27;, &#x27;it was spoken&#x27;, &#x27;it has been spoken&#x27;, and &#x27;it had been spoken&#x27;. The auxiliary verb used for negation, usually with the naked stem of the main verb but with the past participle in the negative imperfect. Finnish lacks a true future tense, so normally the present tense is used for future time as well.

===Conditional and potential mood===

The conditional mood corresponds mostly to &#x27;would&#x27; or &#x27;should&#x27; or to the past subjunctive in English. (Finnish lacks a subjunctive mood.) The potential mood is rather rare, and corresponds to &#x27;may&#x27; or &#x27;might&#x27; in English. The perfect forms of these moods are easily understood as &#x27;would have&#x27;, &#x27;should have&#x27;, &#x27;might have&#x27;, etc.

===Imperative mood and miscellaneous tenses===
The first and third person imperative forms here correspond to English &#x27;let us speak&#x27;, &#x27;let him not speak&#x27;, &#x27;let it not be spoken&#x27;, etc. The perfect imperative is still valid, if somewhat awkward and contrived: as English &#x27;let it (not) have been spoken&#x27;. The first person plural imperative &quot;puhukaamme&quot; sounds rather formal and archaic so in everyday speech, the passive present indicative, &quot;puhutaan&quot;, is used instead, but it may not quite be considered correct. There are many variations of the imperative forms: in old writings, one may also see the forms &quot;puhukaat&quot; or &quot;puhukaatte&quot; for the second person plural, &quot;puhukaan&quot; for the third person plural, or &quot;puhuttakaan&quot; for the passive. In the passive or third person, the imperative is sometimes used for the present or perfect subjunctive of other languages, a mood lacking in Finnish.

The present prospective and the imperfect prospective correspond best to &#x27;I am to speak&#x27; and &#x27;I was to speak&#x27; in English. It is not correct Finnish to use these tenses in the plural: the plural form of the present participle, &quot;puhuvat&quot;, would be confusing if used in this sense, as it resembles too closely the third person plural present indicative. Despite the apparently equivalent use of the present participle, the grammatical aspect of these tenses is prospective rather than continuous or progressive as in English.

===Verbs of obligation in the agent construction===

Verbs of obligation such as &quot;täytyä&quot;, &quot;tarvita&quot;, &quot;pitää&quot;, and &quot;tulla&quot;, with the meanings &#x27;must&#x27;, &#x27;need to&#x27;, &#x27;ought to&#x27;, &#x27;shall&#x27;, respectively are often used in the agent form of construction in which the verb is not conjugated for person but is in the impersonal third person singular. Here
* the person or persons bearing the obligation are regarded as the &#x27;agent&#x27; (not the subject) and in the genitive case
* the verb of obligation is in the impersonal third person singular regardless of the plurality and person of the agent.
* This is followed by another verb or verb phrase in which the verb is in the short from first infinitive (the dictionary form) and which is then regarded as the sentence&#x27;s subject.

: Heidän täytyy puhua minun kanssani = &quot;They must speak with me&quot;;
: Minun täytyy puhua heidän kanssansa = &quot;I must speak with them&quot;;
: Sinun ei tarvitse tehdä tuota = &quot;you don&#x27;t need to do that&quot;;
: Ei sinun pidä tappaman = &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;. (Note the archaic use of the instructive case of the third infinitive. A common error, even for native Finns, is to confuse this with the illative case, &quot;tappamaan&quot;, which would be incorrect. Now, the first infinitive is used with &quot;pitää&quot;.)
: Sinun pitäisi tulla huomenna = &quot;you should come tomorrow&quot;.

There is no equivalent of this type of construction in English.

The verb &quot;täytyä&quot; can be used only in this construction and therefore has no other personal forms. The other verbs can carry personal endings in other forms of construction with the normal subject, verb, and object in which the obligation is less strong or in which the verb takes on a different meaning altogether.

* (Minä) tarvitsen apua &quot;I need help&quot;, expressing need without obligation
* (Minä) pidän hänestä &quot;I like him/her&quot;, verb has a different meaning

==Infinitives and participles==
In Finnish there are five infinitive forms, with past and present participles for both active and passive voices.

===Infinitive I===
First infinitive is the dictionary form of the verb: &quot;puhu-a&quot; = &#x27;to speak&#x27; (stem &quot;puhu&quot;), and it corresponds in meaning and function to the English infinitive introduced by the particle &#x27;to&#x27;. The suffix of the first infinitive depends on the type of the verb stem. With so-called &quot;vowel&quot; stems, (see verbs of Type I, below), the first infinitive suffix is &quot;-a&quot;/&quot;-ä&quot;, whereas with &quot;consonantal&quot; stems, (types IV-VI), the suffix is most often &quot;-ta&quot;/&quot;-tä&quot;. With vowel stems that consist of a single open syllable ending in a long vowel or a diphthong or longer stems that end in such syllables, (Type II), the infinitive suffix is &quot;-da&quot;/&quot;-dä&quot;: &quot;saa-da&quot; = &#x27;to get&#x27;, &quot;syö-dä&quot; = &#x27;to eat&#x27;, &quot;reagoi-da&quot; = &#x27;to react&#x27;. The first infinitive of consonantal stems always has the weak consonant grade in the stem, e.g., &quot;karata&quot; = &#x27;to flee&#x27; &lt; stem &quot;karkaa-&quot;.

It can be used in a sentence similarly to the English infinitive and stand for a subject or a direct object, without any additional inflection. It is also governed by modal verbs like &quot;saattaa&quot; &#x27;might&#x27; or &quot;voida&quot; &#x27;be able to&#x27;: &quot;saattaa mennä&quot; = &#x27;might go&#x27; or &quot;voi hakea&quot; = &#x27;can fetch&#x27;.

It has a so-called &quot;long form&quot;, with the ending of the nominal translative case and an obligatory possessive suffix. The long form is usually associated with the literary register. It connotes either extent or intent:
:&quot;muista-a&quot; = &#x27;to remember&#x27;; &quot;muista-a-kse-ni&quot; = &#x27;as far as I can remember&#x27; (extent), or &#x27;in order that I might remember&#x27; (intent), lit. &#x27;for my remembering&#x27;.
:&quot;näh-dä&quot; = &#x27;to see&#x27;; &quot;näh-dä-kse-en&quot; = &#x27;as far as he/she/it/they can see&#x27; (extent), &#x27;so that they could see&#x27; (intent).
In spoken Finnish, intent is often expressed with the short form infinitive if the subject is implicit or understood by context or more explicitly with a subordinate clause containing a conditional verb: &quot;että minä muistaisin&quot;. Nevertheless, the long form is still used to signify extent; another example: &quot;tietä-ä&quot; = &#x27;to know&#x27;, &quot;tietä-ä-kse-ni&quot; = &#x27;as far as I know&#x27;.

The first infinitive generally takes on no inflected forms. It appears only in the short (dictionary) form and in the long form, and the long form is not used without a possessive suffix.

===Infinitive II===
The second infinitive may be formed from the first infinitive by replacing the final &#x27;a/ä&#x27; with an &#x27;e&#x27;. It occurs in the instructive and inessive cases. If the second infinitive has a subject, the subject is put in the genitive case; in the inessive case, the second infinitive also accepts a possessive suffix if it is appropriate.

The instructive form conveys manner of action corresponding approximately with &#x27;-ing&#x27; or &#x27;-ingly&#x27; in English, less commonly with &#x27;/&#x27; in Swedish and very commonly with &quot; in French. It is parallel in function and meaning to the Russian adverbial participle (as opposed to the adjectival participle):
:&quot;tietäen&quot; = &#x27;knowingly&#x27; (instructive);
:&quot;tietäen&quot;, että hänen täytyisi puhua&quot; = &#x27;knowing that he would have to speak&#x27; = &quot;sachant qu&#x27;il aurait besoin de parler&quot; in French = &quot;зная, что ему следовало бы говорить&quot; in Russian
:&#x27;näin puhuen&#x27; = &#x27;thus speaking&#x27; (instructive);

The inessive form conveys coterminal action, something happening at the same time as something else. More properly, it is seen as some action whose accomplishment simultaneously brings about the accomplishment of something else. It corresponds approximately in English to the use of &#x27;when&#x27;, &#x27;while&#x27;, or the somewhat archaic or British &#x27;whilst&#x27;; strict co-terminality is still expressed in English with &#x27;in&#x27; or &#x27;by&#x27;, the present participle &#x27;-ing&#x27; and any subject in the possessive case in a manner analogous to the Finnish, like in French with &quot; and the present participle &quot;&#x27;-ant&quot;&#x27;:

:&quot;kuollessa = &#x27;in dying&#x27; or &#x27;while dying&#x27; = &quot;en mourant in French (inessive) = &quot;умирая&quot; in Russian
:&quot;Varas iski uhrin syödessä aamupalaa&quot; = &#x27;The thief struck whilst the victim was eating breakfast&#x27;

The inessive of this infinitive also has a passive form:
:&quot;tiedettäessä&quot; = &#x27;in being known&#x27;, said of some fact.

===Infinitive III===
The third infinitive is formed by adding the ending &quot;-ma/mä&quot; to the hard grade of the present stem. It is a noun in its own right, denoting &quot;the act&quot; of a verb. It is fully declineable as a noun, but some of the cases have special or commonly understood meanings. The illative of the third infinitive is a common inchoative, governed by such verbs as &quot;ruveta&quot; and &quot;joutua&quot;:
:&quot;hän rupesi saarnaamaan&quot; = &#x27;he began to preach&#x27;
:&quot;häntä ei mennä neuvomaan&quot; = &#x27;You don&#x27;t go and advise him&#x27;
The elative is used in the sense of forbidding or discouraging an action.
:&quot;poikia kiellettiin polttamasta&quot; = &#x27;the boys were forbidden from smoking&#x27;
The adessive is used to tell how the action is done.
:&quot;jätteet hävitettiin polttamalla&quot; = &#x27;the waste was destroyed by burning&#x27;
Also with a possessive suffix.
:&quot;polttamallani sormella en voinut kirjoittaa&quot; = &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t type with the finger I burned&#x27;
:&quot;kun toimimme neuvomallasi tavalla kaikki onnistui&quot; = &#x27;when we did the way you advised all went well&#x27;

====Agentive participle====
In Finnish, the passive participle cannot be used when the agent is expressed. Finnish uses forms ending in &quot;-ma/mä&quot; that are formally identical to the third infinitive. (Some authors include it as one of the uses of the third infinitive; others list it under the special name &quot;agentive participle&quot;.) The agentive participle is never used when the agent is not expressed, and it must be used in all situations that one wishes to use the passive and express the agent:
: = &#x27;The house was painted by Pekka&#x27;
: = &#x27;the house painted by Pekka&#x27;
: = &#x27;The house was painted by you&#x27;
As expected for a participle, it agrees with the head noun; in the following, the ending &quot;-mia&quot; and &quot;kirjeitä&quot; &#x27;letters&#x27; are in the partitive plural:
:&quot;pojan viime viikolla Japanista ystävilleen kirjoittamia kirjeitä&quot; = &#x27;(some of) the letters written by the boy to his friends last week from Japan&#x27;

===Infinitive IV===
The fourth infinitive is formed just like the third but with the ending &quot;-minen&quot;, which is declined like all other Finnish nouns in &quot;-nen&quot;. It is also a noun but its meaning is more &#x27;the process&#x27; rather than the very act of a verb. This often corresponds to &#x27;-ation&#x27; words in English:
:&quot;käyminen&quot; = &#x27;(the process of) going&#x27;, which can mean &#x27;fermentation&#x27; among other things.
The use of this form as a proper infinitive rather than an &quot;action noun&quot; is generally restricted to forms such as the following in which it implies a sort of obligation:
:&quot;minun on tekeminen jotakin&quot; = &#x27;it is up to me to do something&#x27;
:&quot;on tekeminen jotakin&quot; = &#x27;something ought to be done&#x27;
:&quot;heidän ei ole kysymistä ...&quot; = &#x27;theirs is not to ask ...&#x27;
:&quot;tästä ei ole puhumista&quot; = &#x27;this is not to be spoken of&#x27;;
or this construction, where the finite verb is repeated in the partitive with a possessive suffix:
:&quot;hän puhui puhumistaan&quot; = &#x27;he talked and talked&#x27;.

===Infinitive V===
The rarely used fifth infinitive is a &quot;diminutive&quot; of the third infinitive. It is apparently used only in the adessive plural with a possessive suffix. It indicates that at some point, the action of the verb is &quot;but little&quot; accomplished:
:&quot;olin puhumaisillani&quot; = &#x27;I was just starting to speak&#x27;.

===Present participles===
====Active====
The active present participle is formed by adding &quot;-va/vä&quot; to the hard grade of the present indicative stem of the verb.
:&quot;tulevat päivät ovat tuulisia&quot; = &#x27;the coming days are (going to be) windy&#x27;
(In the nominative plural, the form nearly always coincides with the third person plural present indicative.)

====Passive====
There is also a passive present participle formed by adding the same ending to the passive stem:
:&quot;puhuttava&quot; = &#x27;to be spoken of&#x27;
This form is also ambiguous: it could equally well be the active present participle of the causative &quot;puhuttaa&quot;, &#x27;to cause (someone) to speak&#x27;, thus:
:&quot;puhuttava&quot; = (active) &#x27;making (someone) speak&#x27;
:&quot;puhutettava&quot; = (passive) &#x27;being made to speak&#x27;

===Past participles===
====Active====
The active past participle is usually formed by adding &quot;-nut/nyt&quot; to the short stem, omitting any epenthetic vowel. Verbs of type III (ending in &quot;-lla/llä&quot;, &quot;-rra/rrä&quot;, and &quot;-sta/stä&quot;) assimilate the &quot;n&quot; of this ending:
:&quot;tullut&quot; = &#x27;(one that has) come&#x27;;
:&quot;purrut&quot; = &#x27;(one that has) bitten&#x27;;
:&quot;pessyt&quot; = &#x27;(one that has) washed&#x27;.
The stem of the active past participle, for all other cases except the nominative singular, ends in &quot;-nee-&quot;, which may be likewise assimilated. See tables of conjugation.

====Agentive====
See Agentive Participle above.

====Passive====
The passive past participle has the ending &quot;-tu/ty&quot; or &quot;-ttu/tty&quot; to the soft grade of the stem. For a verb of type I, a final -a/ä- of the stem is replaced by -e- for the passive past participle:
: &quot;antaa&quot; = &#x27;to give&#x27;; &quot;annettu&quot; = &#x27;(that has been) given&#x27;.
The passive past participle is subject to consonant gradation:
:&quot;tt&quot; → &quot;t&quot;;
and for verbs of type III:
:&quot;lt&quot; → &quot;ll&quot;,formula_1 &quot;nt&quot; → &quot;nn&quot;,formula_1 &quot;rt&quot; → &quot;rr&quot;, formula_1 &quot;st&quot; → &quot;st&quot;.

: &quot;annettu = (that has been) given; &quot;annetut = &#x27;(that have been) given&#x27;, (pl.);
: &quot;purtu &#x27;(one that has been) bitten&#x27;, graded as &quot;purru-, e.g. &quot;purrun&quot; &#x27;of that which has been bitten&#x27;.
: &quot;pesty&quot; = &#x27;(that has been) washed&#x27;, unchanged in soft grade, e.g. = &#x27;hair that has been washed&#x27; (pl. of &quot;hius&quot;, &#x27;a single hair&#x27;).

=====Derived passive forms=====
All other passive forms of the verb may be regularly derived from the passive past participle by replacing the final &quot;-u/y&quot; with the following endings:
* in the hard grade:
** &#x27;-iin&#x27;: passive imperfect; &quot;annettiin&quot; &#x27;was given&#x27;
** &#x27;-ava&#x27;:: passive present participle; &quot;annettava&quot; &#x27;that which is (to be) given&#x27;
** &#x27;-aisiin/äisiin&#x27;: passive conditional; &quot;annettaisiin&quot; &#x27;would be given&#x27;
** &#x27;-aisi/äisi&#x27;: passive conditional connegative with negative verb &quot;ei&quot;; &quot;ei annettaisi&quot; &#x27;would not be given&#x27;
** &#x27;-aneen/äneen&#x27;: passive potential; &quot;annettaneen&quot; &#x27;might be given&#x27;
** &#x27;-ane/äne&#x27;: passive potential connegative; &quot;ei annettane&quot; &#x27;might not be given&#x27;
** &#x27;-akoon/äköön&#x27;, &#x27;-akaan/äkään&#x27;: passive imperative; &quot;annettakoon&quot; &#x27;shall be given&#x27;
** &#x27;-ako/äkö&#x27;: passive imperative connegative; &quot;ei annettako&quot; &#x27;shall not be given&#x27;
* in the soft grade:
**&#x27;-aan/ään&#x27;: passive present indicative; &quot;annetaan&quot; &#x27;is given&#x27;
**&#x27;-a/ä&#x27;: passive present indicative connegative with negative verb &quot;ei&quot;; &quot;ei anneta&quot; &#x27;is not given&#x27;

==Overview of main verb types==
The following table shows the basic changes and marks for conjugating each of the types of Finnish verbs:

==Type I verbs==
They are verbs whose infinitive forms end in vowel + &quot;a/ä&quot;, for example &quot;puhua&quot; = &#x27;to speak&#x27;, &quot;tietää&quot; = &#x27;to know&#x27;. The group contains a very large number of verbs. Here is how &quot;tietää&quot; conjugates in the present indicative:

:&quot;minä tiedän&quot; = I know
:&quot;sinä tiedät&quot; = you (singular) know
:&quot;hän/se tietää&quot; = /it knows
:&quot;se tietää&quot; = /it knows (colloquial)
:&quot;me tiedämme&quot; = we know
:&quot;te tiedätte&quot; = you (plural/formal) know
:&quot;he/ne tietävät&quot; = they know
:&quot;ne tietää&quot; = they know (colloquial)

The personal endings are &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-t&quot;, &quot;-(doubled final vowel)&quot;, &quot;-mme&quot;, &quot;-tte&quot;, &quot;-vat&quot;. The inflecting stem is formed by dropping the final &quot;-a/ä&quot; of the infinitive and has a strong-grade consonant in the third-person forms and weak-grade elsewhere. For the third person plural, it is an exception to the general rule for strong grade.

===Past tense===
In the simple case (which applies to most type I verbs), the imperfect indicative is formed by inserting the characteristic marker &quot;i&quot; between the stem and the personal endings, which are the same as in the present tense except that the vowel does not double in the third person singular:
:&quot;puhun = &#x27;I speak&#x27;, &quot;puhuin = &#x27;I spoke&#x27;
:&quot;puhut = &#x27;you speak&#x27;, &quot;puhuit = &#x27;you spoke&#x27;
:&quot;puhuu = &#x27;(he) speaks&#x27;, &quot;puhui = &#x27;(he) spoke&#x27;
:&quot;puhumme = &#x27;we speak&#x27;, &quot;puhuimme = &#x27;we spoke&#x27; and so on.

However, the insertion of the &quot;i&quot; often has an effect on the stem. Of type I verbs, one notable exception is &quot;tietää&quot;:
:&quot;tiedän&quot; = &#x27;I know&#x27;, &quot;tiesin&quot; = &#x27;I knew&#x27;

&quot;ymmärtää&quot; = &#x27;to understand&#x27; also follows this pattern. Changes of stem for other verb types will be discussed in the relevant sections below.

===Passive===
;Present passive: The present passive is formed by adding &quot;-taan&quot; to the inflecting stem of the verb with the consonant in its weak form:
:puhua formula_4 puhu- formula_4 puhutaan
:If the vowel at the end of the stem is &quot;a&quot; or &quot;ä&quot;, it is changed to &quot;e&quot; before the &quot;-taan&quot; ending:
:tietää formula_4 tiedä- formula_4 tiede formula_4 tiedetään

;Past passive: It is formed in the same way as the present passive except that the ending is &quot;-ttiin&quot;: &quot;puhuttiin&quot; = &#x27;it was spoken&#x27;, &quot;tiedettiin&quot; = &#x27;it was known&#x27;.
:Note the presence of the same &quot;i&quot; marker in the past passive as in the imperfect indicative and the presence of the extra &quot;t&quot;.

;Conditional passive: It is formed in the same way as the present passive except that the ending is &quot;-ttaisiin&quot;, hence &quot;puhuttaisiin&quot; = &#x27;it would be spoken&#x27;, &quot;tiedettäisiin&quot; = &#x27;it would be known&#x27;.
:Note the presence of the &quot;isi&quot; conditional marker.

;Potential passive: It is formed in the same way as the present passive except that the ending is &quot;-ttaneen&quot;, hence &quot;puhuttaneen&quot; = &#x27;it may be spoken&#x27;, &quot;tiedettäneen&quot; = &#x27;it may be known&#x27;.
:Note the presence of the &quot;ne&quot; potential marker.

==Type II verbs==
With verbs whose first infinitive ends in vowel + &quot;da&quot; (&quot;juoda&quot; = &#x27;to drink&#x27;, &quot;syödä&quot; = &#x27;to eat&#x27;), it is a fairly large group of verbs partly because one way in which foreign borrowings are incorporated into the Finnish verb paradigms is to add &quot;oida&quot;: &quot;organisoida&quot; = &#x27;to organise&#x27;.

Another important verb of this type is &quot;voida&quot; = &#x27;to be able/allowed to&#x27;.

The stem is formed by removing &quot;da&quot; with no vowel doubling in the third person singular: juon, juot, juo, juomme, juotte, juovat.

===Imperfect indicative===
For these verbs whose stems end in two vowels, the first of the vowels is lost when the &quot;i&quot; is added in the imperfect:
&quot;juon&quot; = &#x27;I drink&#x27;, &quot;join&quot; = &#x27;I drank&#x27;.

There is an exception to the rule if the stem already ends in an &quot;i&quot; (&quot;voida&quot; or the &quot;-oida&quot; verbs mentioned earlier). Then, the stem does not change between present and imperfect indicative so the imperfect forms are the same as the present forms, and the distinction between them must be made from context.

===Passive===
Passives are formed in the same way:
:syödä formula_4 syödään, syötiin, syötäisiin
:juoda formula_4 juodaan, juotiin, juotaisiin

==Type III verbs==
Verbs have a first infinitive ending in two consonants + &quot;a&quot;: &quot;mennä&quot; = &#x27;to go&#x27;. Another way of looking at the verbs is that they have verb stems ending in a consonant to which a vowel must be added (&quot;e&quot; for the present tense or &quot;i&quot; for the past tense) before the personal ending. The final consonant of the stem is generally emphasised by length in the infinitive and participle forms and so is written as a double consonant. If the consonant ending of the stem is -s, however, the dictionary form of the verb ends with -stä or -sta. It is another large group of verbs.

===Present indicative===
The stem is formed by removing the &quot;a&quot; and its preceding consonant, and &quot;e&quot; followed is added, followed by the personal endings: menen, menet, menee, menemme, menette, menevät.

===Imperfect indicative===
The &quot;i&quot; of the imperfect is added directly to the stem formed as for the present tense, and the personal endings are added:
&quot;pestä&quot; = &#x27;to clean&#x27;, &quot;pesen&quot; = &#x27;I clean&#x27;, &quot;pesin&quot; = &#x27;I cleaned&#x27; etc.

===Passive===
;Present passive
:The passive has the same &quot;-aan&quot; ending as for group I verbs but no &quot;t&quot;; the easiest way to form the passive is to extend the vowel on the end of the first infinitive and then add &quot;n&quot;:

:mennä formula_4 mennään

;Other forms
:All other forms of the passive are related to the present passive in the same way as for type I verbs, including the &#x27;extra t&#x27;, except that since there was no &quot;t&quot; to start with, the passive forms have only one. Also, the double consonant before the ending becomes single.

:mennä formula_4 mennään formula_4 mentiin, mentäisiin
:olla formula_4 ollaan formula_4 oltiin (see below), oltaisiin

===&#x27;Olla&#x27; (&#x27;to be&#x27;) ===

Strictly, &#x27;olla&#x27; belongs to this group. &#x27;To be&#x27; is irregular in most languages, and Finnish is no exception, but the irregularities are confined to the 3rd-person forms of the present tense and to all person forms in the active potential mood – everything else is regular.

Indicative present:
:&quot;olen&quot; = I am
:&quot;olet&quot; = you are
:&quot;on&quot; = he/she/it is (irregular)
:&quot;olemme&quot; =&#x27;we are
:&quot;olette&quot; = you are
:&quot;ovat&quot; = they are (irregular)

Potential:
*&quot;lienen&quot; = I might be
*&quot;lienet&quot; = you might be
*&quot;lienee&quot; (or &quot;lie&quot;) = he/she/it might be
*&quot;lienemme&quot; = we might be
*&quot;lienette&quot; = you might be
*&quot;lienevät&quot; = they might be

==Type IV verbs==
Types IV-VI have a first infinitive ending in a vowel and &quot;ta/tä&quot;. Most commonly, type IV verbs end with &quot;ata/ätä&quot;, &quot;ota/ötä&quot;, &quot;uta/ytä&quot;, but other vowels are possible: &quot;tavata&quot; = &#x27;to meet&#x27;, &quot;pilkata&quot; = &#x27;to mock&#x27;, &quot;vastata&quot; = &#x27;to answer&#x27;, &quot;haluta&quot; = &#x27;to want&#x27;, &quot;tarjota&quot; = &#x27;to offer&#x27;.

The stem used in present indicative conjugation is formed by dropping the &quot;-ta/-tä&quot; suffix from the infinitive form and adding &quot;a/ä&quot;. In conjugation, the normal personal ending is added; the final vowel is doubled in the third person singular unless the stem already ends in &quot;aa/ää&quot;:
:&quot;halua-n, halua-t, halua-a, halua-mme, halua-tte, halua-vat&quot;
:&quot;tapaa-n, tapaat, tapaa, tapaa-mme&quot;, etc.
:&quot;pilkkaa-n, pilkkaa-t, pilkkaa, pilkkaa-mme&quot;, etc.
:&quot;vastaa-n, vastaa-t, vastaa, vastaa-mme&quot;, etc.
:&quot;tarjoa-n, tarjoa-t, tarjoa-a, tarjoa-mme&quot;, etc.

The consonant in the stem appears in the strong grade.

===Imperfect indicative===

The imperfect stem can be obtained from the infinitive by changing the final &quot;t&quot; to &quot;s&quot; followed by the usual imperfect marker &quot;i&quot;; the stem consonant appears in the strong grade: &quot;halusi-n&quot; = &#x27;I wanted&#x27;, &quot;tapasi-t&quot; = &#x27;you met&#x27;, &quot;vastasi&quot;, &#x27;he answered&#x27;, etc.

===Passive===
Passives in this type are formed in the same fashion as for type I verbs; as in type I, the stem consonant appears in the weak grade:
:&quot;haluta&quot; formula_4 halutaan, haluttiin, haluttaisiin
:&quot;tavata&quot; formula_4 tavataan, tavattiin, tavattaisiin
:&quot;vastata&quot; formula_4 vastataan, vastattu, vastattiin, etc.

==Type V verbs==
All verbs have infinitives ending in &quot;ita/itä&quot;. There are few members, but &quot;tarvita&quot; = &#x27;to need&#x27; is a common example.

The indicative stem may be obtained by dropping the final &quot;a&quot; and adding &quot;-se&quot;: tarvitsen, tarvitset, tarvitsee, tarvitsemme, tarvitsette, tarvitsevat.

===Imperfect indicative===
&quot;-si&quot; takes the place of &quot;-se&quot;, but in the third-person singular, there is only one vowel: &quot;tarvitsin, tarvitsit, tarvitsi, tarvitsimme, tarvitsitte, tarvitsivat&quot;.

===Passive===
The passive forms of these verbs are built just like those of type IV; both types end in &quot;-ta&quot;.
:valita formula_4 valitaan, valittiin, valittaisiin
:merkitä formula_4 merkitään, merkittiin, merkittäisiin

==Type VI verbs==
Almost all verbs have infinitives ending in &#x27;eta&#x27; (notable exceptions are &quot;parata&quot; = &#x27;to improve/become better&#x27; and &quot;huonota&quot; = &#x27;to deteriorate/become worse&#x27;). There are not many verbs in this category, and they tend to be uncommon. However, it is a fairly common route for turning adjectives into verbs: &quot;kylmä&quot; = &#x27;cold&#x27;, &quot;kylmetä&quot; = &#x27;to get cold&#x27;.

The present stem is characterized by the insertion of &quot;ne&quot; after the infinitive stem and so the final syllable of the stem is open, and hence the final consonant of the stem is in strong grade:
:&quot;rohje-ta&#x27; = &#x27;to dare&quot;&#x27;
::&quot;rohkenen&quot; = &#x27;I dare&#x27;
::&quot;rohkenet&quot; = &#x27;you dare&#x27;
::&quot;rohkenee&quot; = &#x27;he/she/it dares&#x27; etc.
:&quot;pae-ta&quot; = &#x27;to escape&#x27;, &quot;pakenen&quot; = &#x27;I escape&#x27;
:&quot;kylme-tä&quot; = &#x27;to get cold&#x27;, &quot;kylmenen&quot; = &#x27;I get cold&#x27;
:&quot;para-ta&quot; = &#x27;to improve&#x27; (intransitive), &quot;paranen&quot; = &#x27;I improve&#x27;

===Imperfect indicative===
The imperfect indicative is formed by replacing the final &quot;e&quot; of the &quot;ne&quot; stem with the imperfect marker &quot;i&quot;:
::&quot;rohkenin&quot; = &#x27;I dared&#x27;
::&quot;rohkenit&quot; = &#x27;you dared&#x27;
::&quot;rohkeni&quot; = &#x27;he/she/it dared&#x27; etc.

===Passive===
Passives are formed in the same way as for type IV verbs.

==Nonderivable and irregular stems==

Standard Finnish has comparatively very few irregular verbs in addition to &#x27;olla&#x27; discussed above. However, because the infinitive is an inflected form of the root, the consonant gradation may obscure the root. The root of the word &#x27;juosta&#x27; = &#x27;to run&#x27; is ; when generating the infinitive, the pattern &quot;ks&quot; → &quot;s&quot; is applied: → &quot;juosta&quot;. Epenthetic &#x27;e&#x27; is added for personal forms: &quot;juoksen&quot;.

The verb &#x27;käydä&#x27; = &#x27;to go&#x27; is the only verb with &quot;y&quot; → &quot;v&quot; variation ( → ), and thus could be considered irregular.

There is a rare pattern with a stem with &quot;-k-&quot; rendered as &quot;-hdä&quot; in the infinitive but disappearing in gradation:
:&#x27;tehdä&#x27; = &#x27;to do, make&#x27;: tee-; teen, teet, tekee, teemme, teette, tekevät, etc.
:&#x27;nähdä&#x27; = &#x27;to see&#x27;: näe-; näen, näet, näkee, näemme, näette, näkevät, etc.
That is, &quot;teke-&quot; and &quot;näke-&quot; forms are rendered as &quot;tehdä&quot; and &quot;nähdä&quot; in the infinitive but are subject to gradation of &#x27;k&#x27; in personal forms like &quot;teen&quot;. In some colloquial forms, the &#x27;e&#x27; is rendered as a chroneme instead: &quot;nään&quot; instead of &quot;näen&quot; etc.

Spoken Finnish adds some more irregular verbs by assimilative deletion:

<text>Edward Wynne was Proprietary Governor of the Ferryland colony from 1621 to 1626. Born in Wales, he was appointed by Sir George Calvert, (later, first Baron and Lord Baltimore) to establish the colony, and in August 1621, he landed at &quot;Ferryland&quot; with 12 men. By November of that same year, the colonists had completed a large dwelling, and then by Christmas, had added a stone kitchen. In 1622, a second group of colonists led by Daniel Powell was sent to the new English Colony, bringing the population to 32, including seven women. Within a few years, the Colony had housing, a forge, a warehouse, sawmill and wharf. In 1623, the Colony became the Province of Avalon when Calvert&#x27;s grant was confirmed by King Charles I of England, growing to a population of 100 by 1625. Wynne was dismissed that year, probably because he lacked the skills to govern a growing Colony of that size and because Calvert himself wanted to govern the colony directly.

<doc id="554599" wikidata="Q7311595" url="?curid=554599" title="Remedial action">
<text>A remedial action is a change made to a nonconforming product or service to address the deficiency. This also can refer to restoration of a landscape from industrial activity

Rework and repair are generally the remedial actions taken on products, while services usually require additional services to be performed to ensure satisfaction.

In some settings, corrective action is used as an encompassing term that includes remedial actions, corrective actions and preventive actions.

‘Remedial Action’ is a term referring to actions taken by businesses to counteract deficiencies or undesirable characteristics in their products. In this way it is distinct from ‘Corrective Action’, which aims to change the processes that led to these deficiencies, and ‘Preventive Action’, which aims to strengthen weak management systems not yet responsible for any deficiency

Remedial Action is often enacted through ‘Remedial Action Plans’ (RAPs) of three or more stages. For example, one North American river protection scheme drew up a plan that identified environmental problems and sources of pollution, evaluated and carried out actions to restore the area, and confirmed that these actions had been effective 

These actions normally have negative effects on a company’s image and profits. A fine balance is often struck between denying the existence of problems or wrongdoing and choosing to publicise this existence before being exposed removes the company’s ability to control the way any scandal is seen.

==Varieties==
Environmental - If the environment a business works in becomes polluted as the result of the activities of that business, or sometimes other events, this pollution must be cleaned for reasons of safety and welfare. This will normally involve the business either financing the remedial action or applying for the finances to do so. If the business is not at fault, the government may finance the remediation.

Repair/Replacement - When a product is deemed ineffective, either by the company or by public exposure, a recall plan can be put into action, sometimes also involving compensation for consumers.

Policy - When company policy is considered to be in violation of the law, such as keeping inaccurate financial records, remedial action can be taken to change those policies. (HR.BLR.com, 2012). When done after an internal investigation, this can avoid repercussions such as negative publicity or even fines, and the UK Serious Fraud Office states that if a company self-reports corruption it will impact on whether or not prosecution occurs.

==Examples==
Brodex Water - Environmental remedial action is often undertaken by water specialists in the case of infected supply. Some, such as UK Company Brodex Water Treatment Specialists, advertise what services the company provides in the event of Legionella disease being discovered in a local supply, such as tank chlorination and equipment replacement. This proactive strategy improves the company’s public image.

The Great Lakes - Since the mid-1980s, several ‘Remediative Action Plans’ have been drawn up to manage the impact of various stakeholders, including local businesses, on the environmental health of the American-Canadian Great Lakes region.

Volkswagen - The most recent example, VW has recently been forced to recall millions of cars to adjust deficiencies in their pollution controls, after a company policy of only activating them during emissions tests was exposed.

<doc id="554600" wikidata="Q1303497" url="?curid=554600" title="Sri Lanka bush warbler">
<text>The Sri Lanka bush warbler (Elaphrornis palliseri), also known as Ceylon bush warbler or Palliser&#x27;s warbler, is an Old World warbler which is an endemic resident breeder in Sri Lanka, where it is the only bush warbler.

==Taxonomy==
The Sri Lanka bush warbler has sometimes been placed in the genus &quot;Bradypterus&quot; and a 2018 study confirms that it is a sister to the clade that contains the &quot;Bradypterus&quot; and &quot;Megalurus&quot; warblers; it appears to be closely related to that genus, but differs in structure (relatively shorter-tailed and longer-billed), plumage (unmarked) and song. It is monotypic. The species is named after the collector Captain Edward Palliser (1826-1907). Edward and his brother Fred Palliser were both collectors in Sri Lanka. The species was described by Kelaart but published by Edward Blyth in 1851.

==Distribution==
The Sri Lanka bush warbler is a bird of dense forest undergrowth, often close to water. It is found in the highlands of central Sri Lanka, usually above 1200 m. The nest is built in a shrub, and two eggs are laid.

==Description==
This is a medium-large warbler at 14 cm. The adult has a plain brown back, pale grey underparts, a broad tail and short wings. There is a weak supercilium, and the throat is tinged orange. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds lack the throat colouration.

The Sri Lanka bush warbler is a skulking species which can be very difficult to see. Perhaps the best site is Horton Plains National Park. It keeps low in vegetation and, like most warblers, it is insectivorous.

Males are often only detected by the loud song, which has an explosive &quot;queet&quot;.

<doc id="554606" wikidata="Q3046878" url="?curid=554606" title="Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)">
<text>The Free Church of Scotland is a Scottish denomination which was formed in 1843 by a large withdrawal from the established Church of Scotland in a schism known as the Disruption of 1843. In 1900, the vast majority of the Free Church of Scotland joined with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland (which itself mostly re-united with the Church of Scotland in 1929). In 1904, the House of Lords judged that the constitutional minority that did not enter the 1900 union were entitled to the whole of the church&#x27;s patrimony (see &quot;Bannatyne v. Overtoun&quot;); the residual Free Church of Scotland acquiesced in the division of those assets, between itself and those who had entered the union, by a Royal Commission in 1905. Despite the late founding date, Free Church of Scotland leadership claims an unbroken succession of leaders going back to the Apostles.

==Origins==
The Free Church was formed by Evangelicals who broke from the establishment of the Church of Scotland in 1843 in protest against what they regarded as the state&#x27;s encroachment on the spiritual independence of the Church. Leading up to the Disruption, many of the issues were discussed from an evangelical position in Hugh Miller&#x27;s widely circulating newspaper &quot;The Witness&quot;. Of the driving personalities behind the Disruption, Thomas Chalmers was probably the most influential, with Robert Candlish perhaps second. Alexander Murray Dunlop, the church lawyer, was also very involved.

The Disruption of 1843 was a bitter, nationwide division which split the established Church of Scotland. It was larger than the previous historical secessions of 1733 or 1761. The evangelical element had been demanding the purification of the Church, and it attacked the patronage system, which allowed rich landowners to select the local ministers. It became a political battle between evangelicals on one side and the &quot;Moderates&quot; and gentry on the other. The evangelicals secured passage by the church&#x27;s General Assembly in 1834, of the &quot;Veto Act&quot;, asserting that, as a fundamental law of the Church, no pastor should be forced by the gentry upon a congregation contrary to the popular will, and that any nominee could be rejected by majority of the heads of families. This direct blow at the right of private patrons was challenged in the civil courts, and was decided (1838) against the evangelicals. In 1843, 450 evangelical ministers (out of 1,200 ministers in all) broke away, and formed the Free Church of Scotland.


Led by Dr Thomas Chalmers (1780–1847), a third of the membership walked out, including nearly all the Gaelic-speakers and the missionaries, and most of the Highlanders. The established Church kept all the properties, buildings and endowments. The seceders created a voluntary fund of over £400,000 to build 700 new churches; 400 manses (residences for the ministers) were erected at a cost of £250,000; and an equal or larger amount was expended on the building of 500 parochial schools, as well as a college in Edinburgh. After the passing of the Education Act of 1872, most of these schools were voluntarily transferred to the newly established public school-boards.

Chalmers&#x27; ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland&#x27;s communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers&#x27;s idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation. That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers&#x27;s ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.

==Nature==

===Finances===

The first task of the new church was to provide income for her initial 500 ministers and places of worship for her people. As she aspired to be the national church of the Scottish people, she set herself the ambitious task of establishing a presence in every parish in Scotland (except in the Highlands, where FC ministers were initially in short supply.) Sometimes land owners were less than helpful such as at Strontian, where the church took to a boat.

The building programme produced 470 new churches within a year and over 700 by 1847. Manses and over 700 schools soon followed. This programme was made possible by extraordinary financial generosity, which came from the Evangelical awakening and the wealth of the emerging middle class.

The church created a Sustentation Fund, the brainchild of Thomas Chalmers, to which congregations contributed according to their means, and from which all ministers received an &#x27;equal dividend&#x27;. This fund provided a modest income for 583 ministers in 1843/4, and by 1900 was able to provide an income for nearly 1200. This centralising and sharing of resources was previously unknown within the Protestant churches in Scotland, but later became the norm.

===&quot;Send back the money&quot; campaign===
In their original fundraising activities the Free Church sent missionaries to the United States, where they found some slave-owners particularly supportive. However, the church having accepted £3,000 in donations from this source, they were later denounced as unchristian by some abolitionists. Some Free Churchmen like George Buchan, William Collins, John Wilson, and Henry Duncan themselves campaigned for the ultimate abolition of slavery. When Frederick Douglass arrived in Scotland he became a vocal proponent of a &quot;send back the money&quot; campaign which urged the Free Church to return the £3,000 in donations. In his autobiography, &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot;, Douglass (p. 386) writes:

Douglass spoke at three meetings in Dundee in 1846. In 1844, long before Douglass&#x27;s arrival, Robert Smith Candlish had spoken against slavery in a debate about a man named John Brown. In 1847 he is quoted as saying, from the floor of the Free Church Assembly:

Not all American Presbyterians shared his anti-slavery view, although some did both in the north and the south. Presbyterian thinker B. B. Warfield regarded the integration of freed slaves as one of the largest problems America had ever faced. An official letter from the Free Church did reach the Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church in May 1847. The official Free Church position was described as being &quot;very strongly against slavery&quot;.

===Theology===

Great importance was attached to maintaining an educated ministry within the Free Church. Because the established Church of Scotland controlled the divinity faculties of the universities, the Free Church set up its own colleges. New College was opened in 1850 with five chairs: Systematic Theology, Apologetics and Practical Theology, Church History, Hebrew and Old Testament, and New Testament 
Exegesis. The Free Church also set up Christ&#x27;s College in Aberdeen in 1856 and Trinity College in Glasgow followed later. The first generation of teachers were enthusiastic proponents of Westminster Calvinism.

For example, David Welsh was an early professor. James Buchanan followed Thomas Chalmers as professor of Systematic Theology when he died in 1847. James Bannerman was appointed to the chair of Apologetics and Pastoral Theology and his &quot;The Church of Christ&quot; volumes 1 and 2 were widely read. William Cunningham was one of the early Church History professors. John &quot;Rabbi&quot; Duncan was an early professor of Hebrew. Other chairs were added such as the Missionary Chair of Duff.

This position was subsequently abandoned, as theologians such as A. B. Bruce, Marcus Dods and George Adam Smith began to teach a more liberal understanding of the faith. &#x27;Believing criticism&#x27; of the Bible was a central approach taught by such as William Robertson Smith and he was dismissed from his chair by the Assembly in 1881. Attempts were made between 1890 and 1895 to bring many of these professors to the bar of the Assembly on charges of heresy, but these moves failed, with only minor warnings being issued.

In 1892 the Free Church, following the example of the United Presbyterian Church and the Church of Scotland, and with union with those denominations as the goal, passed a Declaratory Act relaxing the standard of subscription to the confession. This had the result that a small number of congregations and even fewer ministers, mostly in the Highlands, severed their connection with the church and formed the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Others with similar theological views waited for imminent union but chose to continue with the Free Church.

===Activity===

The Free Church of Scotland became very active in foreign missions. Many of the staff from the established Church of Scotland&#x27;s India mission adhered to the Free Church. The church soon also established herself in Africa, with missionaries such as James Stewart (1831-1905) and with the co-operation of Robert Laws (1851-1934) of the United Presbyterian Church, as well as becoming involved in evangelisation of the Jews. Her focus on mission resulted in one of the largest missionary organisations in the world. Preachers like William Chalmers Burns worked in Canada and China. Alexander Duff and John Anderson worked in India. Duff can be seen behind Hugh Miller in the Disruption Painting signing Missions in Bengal. There were missions related to the Free Church and visited by Duff at Lake Nyassa in Africa and in the Lebanon.

The early Free Church was also concerned with educational reform including setting up Free Church schools. Members of the Free Church also became associated with the colonisation of New Zealand: the Free Church offshoot the Otago Association sent out emigrants in 1847 who established the Otago settlement in 1848. Thomas Burns was one of the first churchmen in the colony which developed into Dunedin.

The importance of Home Missions also grew, these having the purpose of increasing church attendance, particularly amongst the poorer communities in large cities. Thomas Chalmers led the way with a territorial mission in Edinburgh&#x27;s West Port (1844- ), which epitomised his idea of a &quot;godly commonwealth&quot;. Free churchmen were at the forefront of the 1859 Revival as well as of the Moody and Sankey&#x27;s campaign of 1873–1875 in Britain. However, Chalmers&#x27;s social ideas were never fully realised, as the gap between the church and the urban masses continued to increase.

Towards the end of the 19th century, Free Churches sanctioned the use of instrumental music. An association formed in 1891 to promote order and reverence in public services. In 1898 it published &quot;A New Directory for Public Worship&quot; which, while not providing set forms of prayer, offered directions. The Free Church took an interest in hymnology and church music, which led to the production of its hymnbook.

==Unions and relationships with other Presbyterians==

From its inception, the Free Church claimed it was the authentic Church of Scotland. Constitutionally, despite the Disruption, it continued to support the establishment principle. However some joined the United Presbyterian Church in calling for the disestablishment of the Church of Scotland.

In 1852, the Original Secession Church joined the Free Church; in 1876 most of the Reformed Presbyterian Church followed suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the United Presbyterians was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC with a view to a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship between state and church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate as to what was true in religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time this difference was sufficient to preclude the union being pursued.

In the following years, the Free Church Assembly showed increasing willingness for union on these open terms. However, the &#x27;establishment&#x27; minority prevented a successful conclusion during the years between 1867 and 1873. After negotiations failed in 1873, the two churches agreed a &#x27;Mutual Eligibility Act&#x27; enabling a congregation of one denomination to call a minister from the other.

During this period, the antidisestablishmentarian party continued to shrink and became increasingly alienated. This decline was hastened when some congregations left to form the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1893.

Starting in 1895, union began to be officially discussed once more. A joint committee made up of men from both denominations noted remarkable agreement on doctrinal standards, rules and methods. After a few concessions from both sides, a common constitution was agreed. However, a minority in the Free Church Assembly protested, and threatened to test its legality in the courts.

The respective assemblies of the churches met for the last time on 30 October 1900. On the following day, the union was completed, and the United Free Church of Scotland came into being.

However, a minority of those who dissented remained outside the union, claiming that they were the true Free Church and that the majority had departed from the church when they formed the United Free Church. After a protracted legal battle, the House of Lords found in favour of the minority (in spite of the belief of most that the true kirk is above the state) and awarded them the right to keep the name Free Church of Scotland, though the majority was able to keep most of the financial resources.

==Gaelic Moderators==
For certain years a separate Gaelic Moderator served at a separate Assembly in Inverness. This had advantages of allowing northern ministers to travel less to the Assembly. It did however create a division. In this division it was largely the northern ministers who remained in the Free Church following the Union of 1900. Known Gaelic Moderators are:

*Rev John MacDonald (1845)
*Gustavus Aird (1888)

==Other areas==

The Free Church were spread the length and breadth of Scotland and also had churches in the northmost sectors of England and several churches in London. Their influence in other countries focused on Canada and New Zealand, where there were a high proportion of Scots. They ran a specific recruitment campaign to get Free Church ministers to go to New Zealand. Moderators in New Zealand included:

*Gordon Webster (1898)

Prince Edward Island, Canada, retains a number of Free Churches of Scotland affiliated with the Synod in Scotland as missionary churches. This alliance was established by the Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland, Rev. Ewen MacDougall, in the 1930s, at the time of the establishment of the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the subsequent establishment of the United Church of Canada. The large enclave of Free Church of Scotland congregations has been attributed to a religious revival under the preaching of Rev. Donald MacDonald. The extant Church of Scotland congregations of Prince Edward Island, Canada, continue to adhere to a simple form of worship with a focus on a biblical exegesis from the pulpit, singing of the Psalms and biblical paraphrases without accompaniment or choir, led by a chanter, and prayer. The houses of worship remain simple with minimal embellishment.

<doc id="554608" wikidata="Q391391" url="?curid=554608" title="Nahanni National Park Reserve">
<text>The Nahanni National Park Reserve, sometimes known as &quot;Headless Valley&quot; or &quot;Valley of The Headless Men&quot; (after a series of unsolved historical deaths in the park), in the Dehcho Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada (approximately west of Yellowknife), protects a portion of the Mackenzie Mountains Natural Region. The centrepiece of the park is the South Nahanni River (&quot;Naha Dehé&quot;). Four noteworthy canyons, called First, Second, Third and Fourth Canyon, respectively, line the whitewater river. Each canyon has walls reaching some in height. The word &quot;nahanni&quot; comes from the local Dene name for the area, &quot;Nahʔa Dehé&quot;, which means &quot;river of the land of the Nahʔa people&quot;. The park was one of the earliest locations to be inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO; this designation was given in 1978 due to the area&#x27;s picturesque wilderness, its various waterways and giant falls, and its 1,000 meter-deep limestone canyons, among other features.

== Geography ==

There are several different landforms in the park that have taken millions of years to form, giving it a topographical diversity not seen in any other national park in Canada. Sediments, left by an ancient inland sea present some 500–200 million years ago, have since become pressed into coloured layers of rock. These layers, stacked about deep, are peppered with fossilised remnants of the varied organisms that once swam the ancient seas, beginning well before the time of the dinosaurs. As the continents shifted, the North American and Pacific Plates collided, the force of which forced layers of rock upwards. Ridges of rock thus bent and broke, leaving behind the mountain ranges seen today. This same action also causes volcanic activity, sending magma into (but not through) the sedimentary rock. While there are no active volcanoes in the park, towers of heated rock (igneous batholiths) were sent upwards, pushing the sediment further up. The top layer of sedimentary rock was eventually worn-away, resulting in granite towers that form the Ragged Range.

Over the last two million years, glaciers covered most of North America, creating most of the land formations seen on the continent today. While previous ice ages affected the park area, the most recent, the Wisconsin Ice Age (85,000–10,000 years ago), touched only the most western and eastern parts of the park. This has left many geological features in the park much more time to develop than most of North America had.

The central feature of the park is the South Nahanni River which runs the length of the park, beginning near Moose Ponds and ending when it meets the Liard River near Nahanni Butte. The South Nahanni is a rare example of an antecedent river. The mountains rose slowly enough, and the river was powerful enough, that it maintained its course over its history, meaning it has approximately the same path today as it did before the mountains rose. As the river was meandering, the canyons it carved while entrenching also meander. Most visitors only visit the portions from Virginia Falls (&quot;Nailicho&quot;) down.

There are four main canyons that line the South Nahanni River, named by prospectors, numbering them as they travelled upriver. The fourth canyon, also called Painted Canyon or Five Mile Canyon due to its length, begins with Virginia Falls, and was created as the falls eroded the limestone surrounding the river, working its way upstream. Third canyon runs through the Funeral Range, around long. Because its walls are composed of strata of shale, sandstones and limestone, this canyon has long slopes instead of steep, flat walls like the lower canyons. Big Bend, a point where the river does a 45-degree turn, marks the end of Third Canyon and the beginning of Second Canyon. At long, it runs through the Headless Range. The final canyon is considered the most beautiful. Beginning after Deadmen Valley, First Canyon boasts the highest, most vertical walls, cutting through very resistant limestone. It ends near Kraus Hotsprings, making it about long. Following this, the river slows and braids into different channels, passing through the park boundary, and coming together again near the village of Nahanni Butte. Soon after the town, the South Nahanni River joins the Liard River.

Notable mountains in the park include Mount Nirvana (), officially an unnamed peak, which at is the highest mountain in the Northwest Territories. Slightly further north lies Mount Sir James MacBrien (), the territories second highest peak at , and Lotus Flower Tower (, ) both of which form part of the Cirque of the Unclimbables ().

==Virginia Falls==

At Virginia Falls, or &quot;Nailicho&quot; in Dene (), the river plunges into a thunderous plume. In the centre of the falls is a dramatic spire of resistant rock, &quot;Mason&#x27;s Rock&quot;, named after Bill Mason, the famous Canadian canoeist, author, and filmmaker. The falls were initially located downstream at the east end of Fourth Canyon, but, over the centuries, have carved their way backwards through the limestone that lines the river. This continuous erosion shifted the falls upstream and created the Fourth Canyon. Due to the constant mists created by the waterfalls, and the insulating cliff walls, a favourable microclimate in the immediate vicinity of the falls fosters a rich botanical biodiversity, including several boreal orchid species, such as &quot;Calypso bulbosa&quot;, &quot;Cypripedium parviflorum&quot; and &quot;passerinum&quot;, &quot;Galearis rotundifolia&quot;, and &quot;Platanthera aquilonis&quot;, &quot;huronensis&quot; and &quot;obtusata&quot;. Downstream from the falls are many infamous river rapids, sought-out by adventurers each year, including the well-known &quot;Figure Eight&quot;, and &quot;George&#x27;s Riffle&quot; and &quot;Lafferty&#x27;s Riffle&quot;.

== Rabbitkettle Hotsprings ==
The Rabbitkettle (&quot;Gahnîhthah&quot;) Hotsprings and tufa mounds () are the largest of tufa mounds in Canada. The largest of the mounds, the North Mound, is high and across. The source of the springs comes from deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust, near the base of the granite batholiths that form the Ragged Range. The volcanic activity that raised the mountains still heats the water deep below the surface of the Earth. The heated water percolates upwards, dissolving calcium carbonate from limestone deposits on its way by. When it reaches the surface springs, the water cools and the calcium carbonate particles are released. These microscopic particles settle to form porous calcite rims around the pools of water. These pools range in size from that of a bathtub to that of a fingernail. This process takes a great deal of time, and it is believed that the mounds themselves are around 10,000 years old, their creation beginning at the end of the last ice age.

These rare and fragile features are protected as a Zone 1, Special Preservation Area, and all visitors must be accompanied by Parks Canada staff in order to minimize impact and visitors to the North Mound are required to be barefoot.

The park&#x27;s sulphur hot springs, alpine tundra, mountain ranges, and forests of spruce and aspen are home to many species of birds, fish and mammals. The park lies within three of Canada&#x27;s ecozones, the Taiga Cordillera in the west, the Taiga Plains in the east and a small southern portion in the Boreal Cordillera.

According to Parks Canada, there are about 42 mammal species in the park, in addition to around 180 types of bird, 16 fishes and a few hardy amphibians, with the wood frog being the most commonly-found in the region. In the &quot;State of the Park Report 2009&quot;, the NWT government named ten special-concern, threatened, or endangered species that the Nahanni National Park Reserve provides appropriate year-round or seasonal habitat for, according to the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). These include the common nighthawk, grizzly bear, olive-sided flycatcher, peregrine falcon, rusty blackbird, short-eared owl, wood bison, woodland caribou, wolverine and yellow rail. In addition, the bull trout and the Nahanni aster are listed, but without status; the Canada warbler and western toad are listed as possibly existing in the park.

Mammal species found in the park include the American black bear, American mink, beaver, Arctic ground squirrel, Canada lynx, collared pika, Dall sheep, fisher, grey wolf, hoary bat, hoary marmot, least chipmunk, least weasel, moose, muskrat, northern myotis, mule deer, pine marten, red fox, red squirrel, river otter, Rocky Mountain goat, snowshoe hare, white-tailed deer and several types of shrew and vole.

Birds are numerous, and include American kestrel, bald and golden eagles, barred owl, belted kingfisher, boreal owl, black-capped and boreal chickadees, Canada goose, Canada jay, eared grebe, great grey owl, great horned owl, grouse, gulls, gyrfalcon, harlequin ducks, horned grebe, loons (the common, Pacific, red-throated and yellow-billed), mallards, northern harrier, northern shrike, osprey, pied-billed grebe, ptarmigan, redpoll, red-necked grebe, red phalarope, sandpipers and plovers, sharp-shinned hawk, snow goose, surf scoter, swallows, woodpeckers and sapsuckers, and trumpeter and tundra swans. It also includes the only known nesting site of the whooping crane.

Fish found in the park include, Arctic grayling, burbot, inconnu, lake trout, lake chub, lake whitefish, longnose dace, longnose sucker, mountain whitefish, northern pike, round whitefish, slimy sculpin, spoonhead sculpin, spottail shiner and trout-perch.

The diverse range of soils offers several specialized and uncommon habitats. More than 700 species of vascular plants and 300 species of both bryophytes and lichen can be found in the park, giving it a richer variety than any other area in the NWT. Nahanni aster is a very rare species of aster found only in the Park.

== History ==
The Dene, sometimes called Slavey peoples, have used the lands around Nahanni National Park Reserve for thousands of years. The first human occupation of the area is estimated to have occurred 9,000-10,000 years ago. Evidence of prehistoric human use has been found at Yohin Lake and a few other sites within the park. The local oral history contains many references to the Naha tribe, a mountain-dwelling people who used to raid settlements in the adjacent lowlands. These people are said to have rather quickly and mysteriously disappeared.

First contact with European fur traders expanding into the region occurred in the 18th century, and was increased with Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s exploration of the Mackenzie River (Deh Cho), and building of trading posts at Fort Simpson and Fort Liard. At both of these John McLeod, a Scottish explorer of the area, was to serve as manager. During the 19th century, most Dene families left their nomadic lifestyles and settled into more permanent communities, often close to the trading posts. Permanent settlements were established at locations such as Nahanni Butte, Fort Liard and Fort Simpson.

In the late 19th century, the Mountain Indians of the Nahanni region would travel down the Nahanni River each spring in mooseskin boats to trade the winter take of furs. These boats, based on the York boats used by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, were up to in length. Constructed from six to ten untanned moose hides sewn together and stretched over a spruce pole frame, these boats would transport entire families, their dogs and cargo of furs down the river during high water. Upon arrival the boat was dismantled and the hides traded along with the furs. Following a visit to the forts, these people would return to the high country with only what they could carry on their pack dogs.

The stories of the Naha, and dangerous landscape that they inhabited, grew in stature with the Klondike Gold Rush as some explorers attempted to use the Nahanni as a path to the famous gold fields of the Yukon, or to try and make their fortune on the Flat and South Nahanni Rivers. Although no significant gold was recovered, legends of haunted valleys and lost gold emerged after the headless corpses of Métis prospectors Willie and Frank McLeod were found around 1908. The Lost McLeod Mine, a legendary lost mine somewhere in the park, is supposed to have been where the two brothers found their gold. In the years that followed, mysterious deaths of other prospectors added to the legends. Alternative names given to the park, which include Deadmen Valley, Headless Creek, Headless Range and the Funeral Range, bear testimony to these stories and legends. In later years, Albert Faille was a prospector in the area and met writer Raymond M. Patterson. The latter&#x27;s works brought minor fame to Faille.

In 1946 Calgary geologist and mining expert Frank M. W. Henderson returned from the valley reporting his partner John Patterson had disappeared. Henderson and Patterson had agreed to meet at a point near Virginia Falls. The first to arrive would leave a message on a large tree which both knew from previous trips. Henderson arrived first and left his message before travelling into the valley. He returned several weeks later only to find there was still no message left by Patterson. Henderson and his party camped there a few days, but one night were awoken by a group of First Nations people who warned of white figures moving along the valley.

In 1947 author Pierre Berton was sent by &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; to cover the north. He, along with pilot Russ Baker, flew up the Headless Valley. Writing on his journey for Macleans Berton remarked, &quot;Frank Henderson himself, a man who perhaps has good reason not to want too many people rushing into the valley, was quoted as saying, on his return from the area last fall, &#x27;There is absolutely no denying the sinister atmosphere of that whole valley. The weird, continual wailing of the wind is something I won&#x27;t soon forget.&#x27;&quot;

In 1964, explorer parachutist Jean Poirel from Montreal jumped at its source north of Yellowknife, followed by his teammate Bertrand Bordet. Jean Poirel imagined the idea of going down the river with inflatable dinghies. During the following four consecutive expeditions in the valley Jean Poirel discovered more than 250 caverns. The most important contained 116 Dall sheep&#x27;s skeletons (carbon-14 dated to 2500 years BC); Jean Poirel named it &quot;Valerie Cavern&quot; after his daughter. He took topographic notes and drew detailed maps, paving the way for the park&#x27;s creation. During his last expedition in 1972, he escorted Pierre Trudeau, who came to evaluate the region.

=== Park history ===
Originally established in 1972, by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the park was in area. The park was in &quot;reserve&quot; status pending settlement of outstanding Aboriginal land claims in the region. In 2003, an agreement between the Dehcho First Nations and Parks Canada gave temporary protection to . In August 2007, the federal government added an extra .

In a novel form of cooperation between federal government and native groups, the Naha Dehe Consensus Team was formed in June 2000 by Canada and the Dehcho First Nations. Their original main tasks included:
# prepare an Ecological Integrity Statement,
# complete a review of the Park Management Plan,
# prepare an Interim Park Management Arrangement, and
# prepare a Memorandum of Understanding Respecting Park Expansion.

In 2003, these were completed and the purpose of the team changed, now dealing with cooperative management issues, according to the Interim Park Management Arrangement, until the Dehcho Process is completed.

On 9 June 2009 the Government of Canada, with the Dehcho First Nations, announced legislation that will increase the area of Nahanni National Park to cover , including 91% of the Greater Nahanni ecosystem in the Dehcho Region and most of the South Nahanni River watershed.

The new park area is estimated to be the home of around 500 grizzly bears, two herds of woodland caribou, as well as species of alpine sheep and goats and other species. The new boundary will include the highest mountains and largest ice fields in the Northwest Territories. With the expansion of the park there have been several added designated landing sites. Because most access to the park is done by aircraft and air access is restricted in the park, there are set places aircraft can land. Before the expansion these were limited to Virginia Falls and Rabbitkettle Lake. Now there are five more: the Bunny Bar, Island Lake, Honeymoon Lake, Glacier Lake, and Seaplane Lake. However, only Virginia Falls and Glacier Lake are designated for day use visitation, meaning all other sites require visitors to stay overnight in the park.

A visitor centre in Fort Simpson features displays on the history, culture and geography of the area. The park was among the world&#x27;s first four natural heritage locations to be inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1978. The South Nahanni River achieved Canadian Heritage River status in 1987. Presently around 800–1000 people visit the park every year, most of which are overnight visitors who travel down the South Nahanni. The park is open year-round, but most visitors come in June, July, and August. Virginia Falls is the only area of the park where a reservation is required, which must be done months in advance to prevent overcrowding. For safety reasons, all visitors must register with park officials upon entering the park boundaries, and deregister within 24 hours of leaving. There is a park office in Nahanni Butte at the end of the river, where visitors can deregister. The only practical way to get to Nahanni National Park is by floatplane or by helicopter, usually from Fort Simpson but other communities and locations offering a gateway into the park include: Watson Lake, Muncho Lake, Fort Nelson and Inconnu Lodge. Some people do hike in from the Nahanni Range Road at Tungsten to the west of the park.

In 2007 the park was voted one of the Seven Wonders of Canada in a competition sponsored by CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot; and CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot;. The park was the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;, directed by Kevin McMahon and scored by Shad, Jace Lasek and Olga Goreas.

== In fiction ==
The area was featured in &quot;Sick Heart River&quot;, a fictional river in the Nahanni area, by John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir who was the Governor General of Canada. Buchan had not visited the Nahanni but had travelled down the Mackenzie and wanted to visit the area. &quot;The River&quot;, a book by Cheryl Kaye Tardif, is based on stories and legends from the area.

The Nahanni River and its surroundings has also been featured in the French book &quot;La Vallée Sans Homme&quot;, written in 1973 by Roger Frison-Roche.

<text>Angelina Helen Catherine Cordovano (June 28, 1936 – November 22, 1988), known professionally as Cathy Carr, was an American pop singer.

==Career==
She was born in The Bronx. As a child, she appeared on &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour,&quot; a television show locally aired in New York; sponsored by Horn &amp; Hardart, a cafeteria chain which had locations in New York and Philadelphia. She later became a singer and dancer with the USO and joined big band orchestras such as those of Sammy Kaye and Johnny Dee.

In 1953 she signed with Coral Records, but had no hits for them, later switching to Fraternity Records, a small company based in Cincinnati, Ohio, in early 1955. It was for Fraternity that she had her only major hit, &quot;Ivory Tower&quot;, which was her third record for Fraternity.

She never had another big hit, though in 1959 she had two small successes for Roulette Records. She recorded one single for Smash Records in 1961, which was a more mature song, but went back to recording teenage pop on Laurie Records in 1962. She moved to RCA to record a number of albums of standards, before Laurie released her final single in 1967. Her first LP was reissued on Dot Records in 1966.

At the time of her 1956 hit, she recorded a lot of high school pop, not moving on to more mature songs and standards until her pop career was all but over. The CD age saw an unofficial release of selected singles, which showed her preference to seem younger than she was and did not include her attempts at more mature songs.

==Death==
Carr died from ovarian cancer on November 22, 1988, in Fayetteville, New York.

<text>Ferryland is a town in Newfoundland and Labrador on the Avalon Peninsula. According to the 2021 Statistics Canada census, its population is 371.

==Seventeenth century settlement==
Ferryland was originally established as a station for migratory fishermen in the late 16th century but had earlier been used by the French, Spanish, and Portuguese. By the 1590s it was one of the most popular fishing harbours in Newfoundland and acclaimed by Sir Walter Raleigh. Ferryland was called &quot;Farilham&quot; by the Portuguese fishermen and &quot;Forillon&quot; by the French—it later became anglicized to its current name &quot;Ferryland.&quot; (This should not be confused with the Forillon National Park in Quebec, which still keeps its French name.)

The land was granted by charter to the London and Bristol Company in the 1610s and the vicinity became the location of a number of short-lived English colonies at Cuper&#x27;s Cove, Bristol&#x27;s Hope, and Renews and adjoined the colony of South Falkland. In 1620 the territory was granted to George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore who had obtained the holdings from William Vaughan.
Calvert appointed Edward Wynne to establish a colony which became the first successful permanent colony in Newfoundland growing to a population of 100 by 1625. In 1623, Calvert&#x27;s grant was confirmed and expanded. The Charter of Avalon was granted to Lord Baltimore by James I. Dated 7 April 1623 it created the Province of Avalon on the island of Newfoundland and gave Baltimore complete authority over all matters in the territory. That same year Baltimore chose Ferryland as the principal area of settlement. In the 1660s, the colony was attacked by the Dutch.

The town was destroyed by New France in 1696 during the Avalon Peninsula Campaign of King William&#x27;s War. Virtually forgotten for centuries, excavations of the original settlement began in earnest in the late 1980s and continue to this day.

==Historic designations==
The site of the 17th-century Colony of Avalon was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1953. It was also designated a Municipal Heritage District in 1998.

The Historic Ferryland Museum was designated a Municipal Heritage Site in 2006.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 census conducted by Statistics Canada, Ferryland had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Henry Drummond FRSE FGS (17 August 1851 – 11 March 1897) was a Scottish evangelist, biologist, writer and lecturer.

Many of his writings were too adapted to the needs of his own day to justify the expectation that they would long survive it. His sermon &quot;The Greatest Thing in the World&quot; remains popular in Christian circles.

== Early life ==
Drummond was born at Park Place in Stirling, the son of William Drummond (d.1888) a seedsman and founder of Drummond Seeds, and his wife, Jane Campbell Blackwood (d.1910). His early education was at Stirling High School and Morrison&#x27;s Academy.

Drummond was educated at Edinburgh University, where he displayed a strong inclination for physical and mathematical science. The religious element was an even more powerful factor in his nature, and he entered the Free Church of Scotland. While preparing for the ministry, he became for a time deeply interested in the evangelizing mission of D.L. Moody and I.D. Sankey, where he was active for two years. Theologically, Drummond was significantly influenced by the Reveil movement in Reformed Protestantism.

== Career ==
In 1877 he was lecturer on natural science in the Free Church College on Lynedoch Street in Glasgow, which enabled him to combine all the pursuits for which he felt a vocation. Drummond advocated for theistic evolution. His studies resulted in his writing &quot;Natural Law in the Spiritual World&quot;, the argument being that the scientific principle of continuity extends from the physical world to the spiritual. Before the book was published in 1883, an invitation from the African Lakes Company took Drummond to Central Africa.

In 1880 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Archibald Geikie, William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, John Gray McKendrick, and Sir Robert Christison.

On his return in the following year he found himself famous. In 1884 he was a guest at Haddo House for a dinner hosted by John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair in honour of William Ewart Gladstone on his tour of Scotland. Large bodies of serious readers, among the religious and the scientific classes alike, discovered in &quot;Natural Law&quot; the common ground they needed; and the universality of the demand proved, if nothing more, the seasonableness of its publication. Drummond continued to be actively interested in missionary and other movements among the Free Church students.

In 1888 he published &quot;Tropical Africa&quot;, a valuable digest of information. In 1890 he travelled in Australia, and in 1893 delivered the Lowell Lectures in Boston. He had meant to keep them aside for mature revision, but an attempted piracy compelled him to hasten their publication, and they appeared in 1894 under the title of &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;. Their object was to ratify altruism or, the disinterested care and compassion of animals for each other, important in effecting the survival of the fittest, a thesis previously maintained by philosopher professor John Fiske.

== Personal life ==
Drummond never married and had no children. In the late stage of his life he lived at 3 Park Circus in Glasgow.

== Death ==
Drummond&#x27;s health failed shortly after &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;. He had suffered from bone cancer for some years, and he died on 11 March 1897 while travelling in Tunbridge Wells. His body was returned to Holy Rude Cemetery in Stirling for burial with his parents. The grave, marked by a large distinctive red granite Celtic cross, stands just north-east of the church.

In 1905 a medallion plaque to his memory was erected in the Free Church College in Edinburgh, sculpted by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray.

<doc id="554622" wikidata="Q1640479" url="?curid=554622" title="Negation normal form">
<text>In mathematical logic, a formula is in negation normal form (NNF) if the negation operator (formula_1, ) is only applied to variables and the only other allowed Boolean operators are conjunction (formula_2, ) and disjunction (formula_3, ). 

Negation normal form is not a canonical form: for example, formula_4 and formula_5 are equivalent, and are both in negation normal form.

In classical logic and many modal logics, every formula can be brought into this form by replacing implications and equivalences by their definitions, using De Morgan&#x27;s laws to push negation inwards, and eliminating double negations. This process can be represented using the following rewrite rules:

:formula_6

(In these rules, the formula_7 symbol indicates logical implication in the formula being rewritten, and formula_8 is the rewriting operation.)

Transformation into negation normal form can increase the size of a formula only linearly: the number of occurrences of atomic formulas remains the same, the total number of occurrences of formula_2 and formula_3 is unchanged, and the number of occurrences of formula_1 in the normal form is bounded by the length of the original formula.

A formula in negation normal form can be put into the stronger conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form by applying distributivity. Repeated application of distributivity may exponentially increase the size of a formula. In the classical propositional logic, transformation to negation normal form does not impact computational properties: the satisfiability problem continues to be NP-complete, and the validity problem continues to be co-NP-complete. For formulas in conjunctive normal form, the validity problem is solvable in polynomial time, and for formulas in disjunctive normal form, the satisfiability problem is solvable in polynomial time.

==Examples and counterexamples==
The following formulae are all in negation normal form:
:formula_12

The first example is also in conjunctive normal form and the last two are in both conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form, but the second example is in neither.

The following formulae are not in negation normal form:
:formula_13

They are however respectively equivalent to the following formulae in negation normal form:
:formula_14

<doc id="554623" wikidata="Q2322434" url="?curid=554623" title="St. Pepin (grape)">
<text>St. Pepin is a modern hybrid variety of wine grape, mostly grown in North America. It produces grapes suitable for making fruity white wines similar to Riesling or as a base for blended wines. The grapes also make a good seeded table grape for eating. It has the benefits of early ripening and when hardened properly in the fall it is winter hardy to at least . As such, it best suited to growing in more northern climates.

St. Pepin was bred by Elmer Swenson c. 1970 and released in 1986. It is a hybrid of the male Seyval blanc crossed to a seedling of Minnesota 78 by Seibel 1000 (a.k.a. Rosette). Unlike most modern grapes, it is a pistillate female and so needs to be planted next to male vines from a close sibling variety to achieve pollination.

==Parentage==
To clarify the parentage of St. Pepin;
*&quot;Minnesota 78&quot; is recorded as a cross of Beta by Witt, but many have doubted this pedigree, and Elmer Swenson suggested that the male parent may be Jessica, a cross of &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; by a variety of &quot;Vitis aestivalis.&quot;
*&quot;Beta&quot; is a cross of a variety of &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; by Concord.
*Seyval is a cross of Seibel 5656 and Seibel 4986. Both these hybrids are a complex set of crosses of other Seibel hybrids.

<doc id="554624" wikidata="Q3408322" url="?curid=554624" title="Province of Avalon">
<text>The Province of Avalon was the area around the English settlement of Ferryland in what is now Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada in the 17th century, which upon the success of the colony grew to include the land held by Sir William Vaughan and all the land that lay between Ferryland and Petty Harbour.

==History==
The Avalon Peninsula was one of the first European-inhabited areas in North America. In 1497 the Bristol Guild of Merchants financed a voyage by John Cabot to Newfoundland, where he is reported to have landed at Cape Bonavista. Basque sailors used the area as a base for whale hunting.

===The London and Bristol Company=== 

In the early 17th century English merchants began to take an interest in the Newfoundland fishery. The Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers established the London and Bristol Company (the Newfoundland Company) in 1608 and sent John Guy, to locate a favourable location for a colony. The first permanent English settlement was established at Cuper&#x27;s Cove in 1610.

The company was granted a charter by James I on 2 May 1610 giving it a monopoly in agriculture, mining, fishing and hunting on the Avalon Peninsula. They retained exclusive rights until 1616 when the Crown began to grant lands to others.

===Lord Baltimore===
Sir George Calvert acquired a large land holding on the peninsula and hired an agent Captain Edward Wynne to set up headquarters in Ferryland. The initial colony grew to a population of 100, becoming the first successful permanent settlement on Newfoundland island. In 1620 Calvert obtained a grant from Sir William Vaughan for all of the land that lay north of a point between Fermeuse and Aquaforte to as far north as Caplin Bay (now Calvert) on the southern shore of the Avalon Peninsula.

In 1623, Calvert was given a Royal Charter extending the Royal lands and granting them the name the Province of Avalon &quot;in imitation of Old Avalon in Somersetshire wherein Glassenbury stands, the first fruits of Christianity in Britain&quot;. The charter created the province as a palatinate in which Calvert had absolute authority. Calvert wished to make the colony a refuge for Roman Catholics facing persecution in England. In 1625 Calvert was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as The 1st Baron Baltimore.

A series of crises and calamities led Calvert to quit the colony in 1629 for &quot;some other warmer climate of this new world&quot;, which turned out to be Maryland, though his family maintained agents to govern Avalon until 1637, when the entire island of Newfoundland was granted by charter to Sir David Kirke and The 3rd Marquess of Hamilton (who was later created The 1st Duke of Hamilton). Lord Baltimore&#x27;s son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, fought against the new charter, and in 1660 gained official recognition of the old Charter of Avalon, but never attempted to retake the colony.

The site of the colony was designated a National Historic Site in 1953 It was also designated a Municipal Heritage District in 1998.

<text>Troodos or Trodos is the largest mountain range in Cyprus, located in roughly the center of the island. Its highest peak is Mount Olympusalso known in Greek as at .

Covering a third of Cyprus&#x27;s area, the Troodos mountain range stretches across most of the western side of Cyprus. The mountains form a significant rainshadow on the island. There are many mountain resorts, Byzantine monasteries, and churches on mountain peaks, and, nestling in its valleys and mountains, villages which cling to terraced hills. The area has been known since antiquity for its mines, which for centuries supplied copper to the entire Mediterranean. In the Byzantine period it became a centre of Byzantine art, as churches and monasteries were built in the mountains, away from the threatened coastline.

The mountains are home to Troodos Station, a listening post for both the American National Security Agency and the British GCHQ.

The name &quot;Troodos&quot; probably comes from one of two sources: either + ( + ), referring to the three roads that lead to the mountain, or + + ( + + ), meaning the mountains of Adonis.

It has many endemic plants and animals, including the endemic Cyprus cedar.

==Geology==

The Troodos Mountains are known for the presence of an undisturbed ophiolite sequence, the Troodos Ophiolite. These mountains slowly rose from the sea due to the collision of the African and European tectonic plates, a process that eventually formed the island of Cyprus. The slowing and near-cessation of this process left the rock formations nearly intact, while subsequent erosion uncovered the magma chamber underneath the mountain, allowing a viewing of intact rocks and petrified pillow lava formed millions of years ago, an excellent example of ophiolite stratigraphy. The observations of the Troodos ophiolite by Ian Graham Gass and co-workers was one of the key points that led to the theory of sea floor spreading. A detailed descriptive geological survey of Troodos was published in 1959. This document predates the modern theory of plate tectonics, but contains exhaustive descriptions of rocks and structures.

==Climate==
Like the rest of Cyprus, the climate is Mediterranean but with somewhat greater diurnal ranges in temperature than coastal locations. For example, at Prodromos, daily mean temperatures are around in January and in July.

==Flora and fauna==
The most ubiquitous trees in the Troodos mountains are the Turkish pine (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;) and the golden oak (&quot;Quercus alnifolia&quot;). Some plants of the &quot;Olea&quot;, &quot;Rhus&quot; and &quot;Rosa&quot; genera populate the mountains, in particular &quot;Crataegus azarolus&quot;, &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;, &quot;Rhus coriaria&quot; and &quot;Rosa canina&quot;.

At higher altitudes, Anatolian black pine-dominated forests (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; ssp. &quot;Pallasiana&quot;) grow, with several &quot;Juniperus&quot; species (&quot;J. excelsa&quot;, &quot;J. foetidissima&quot; and &quot;J. oxycedrus&quot;). The common whitebeam (&quot;Sorbus aria&quot;) also grows, along with the endemic shrubs &quot;Rosa chionistrae&quot; and &quot;Berberis cretica&quot;. The Cyprus cedar (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot; subsp. &quot;brevifolia&quot;) is seen at the highest peaks.

Chief among the fauna is the endangered Cyprus mouflon (&quot;Ovis gmelini ophion&quot;). The venomous Cypriot blunt-nosed viper (&quot;Macrovipera lebentinus lebentinus&quot;) is present in the mountains, as well as a bird population including the common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus fasciatus&quot;), Red crossbill (&quot;Loxia curvirostra&quot;) and the Eurasian griffon vulture (&quot;Gyps fulvus&quot;).

==Churches==

The region is known for its many Byzantine churches and monasteries, richly decorated with murals, of which the Kykkos monastery is the richest and most famous. Nine churches and one monastery in Troodos together form a World Heritage Site, originally inscribed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1985. The nine Byzantine churches are:
* Stavros tou Agiasmati
* Panagia tou Araka
* Timiou Stavrou at Pelendri

<doc id="554631" wikidata="Q6758132" url="?curid=554631" title="Marcus Dods (theologian born 1834)">
<text>Marcus Dods (11 April 1834 – 26 April 1909) was a Scottish divine and controversial biblical scholar. He was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. He served as Principal of New College, Edinburgh.

==Life==

He was born at Belford, Northumberland, the youngest son of Rev Marcus Dods, a minister of the Church of Scotland and his wife, Sarah Pallister.

He attended Edinburgh Academy and then studied divinity at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1854 and being licensed in 1858. He had a difficult probationary period, being refused by 23 churches. In 1864 he became minister of Renfield Free Church, Glasgow, where he worked for twenty-five years.
In 1889 he was appointed professor of New Testament Exegesis in the New College, Edinburgh, of which he became principal on the death of Robert Rainy in May 1907.

He became part of the United Free Church of Scotland on its formation in 1900, and in 1901 was elected Moderator of its General Assembly in 1902. 
He declined the position, stating that &quot;he cannot see his way to undertake the duties&quot;. 
It was assumed he felt that being a neutral moderator, he would not be able to express his opinions on certain doctrinal points due to be discussed.

In later life he lived with his children and grandchildren in a huge Georgian townhouse, 23 Great King Street, in Edinburgh&#x27;s Second New Town.

In spring of 1907 he filled in for Rev Robert James Drummond preaching at Lothian Road UF Church while the Drummonds visited the Holy Land.

On 26 April 1909, he died in Edinburgh. He was buried in the Dean Cemetery. The grave lies in the eastern part of the original north extension. He is buried with his wife and youngest son, Francis Palliser Dods (1879-1910).

==Family==
In 1871, he married Catherine Swanston (1844-1901), daughter of James Swanston.
They had three sons and one daughter. Their eldest son, an advocate, was also named Marcus Dods.

His sister Mary Frances Dods married the antiquarian Rev George Wilson of Glenluce.

==Works==
Throughout his life, both ministerial and professorial, he devoted much time to the publication of theological books. 
Several of his writings, especially a sermon on &quot;Inspiration&quot; delivered in 1878, incurred the charge of unorthodoxy, and shortly before his election to the Edinburgh professorship he was summoned before the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, but the charge was dropped by a large majority, and in 1891 he received the honorary degree of DD from Edinburgh University.

He edited Johann Peter Lange&#x27;s &quot;Life of Christ in English&quot; (Edinburgh, 1864, 6 vols.), Augustine&#x27;s works (1872–1876), and, with Alexander Whyte, &quot;Clark&#x27;s Handbooks for Bible Classes&quot; series. In the &quot;Expositors Bible&quot; series he edited Genesis and 1 Corinthians, and he was also a contributor to the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and &quot;Hastings&#x27; Dictionary of the Bible&quot;. He published a translation of Augustine&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot; in 1871.

Among other important works are:
*&quot;The Epistle to the Seven Churches&quot; (1865)
*&quot;An Introduction to the New Testament&quot;
*&quot;Israel&#x27;s Iron Age&quot; (1874)
*&quot;Mohammed, Buddha and Christ&quot; (1877)
*&quot;Handbook on Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi&quot; (1879)
*&quot;The Gospel according to St John&quot; and &quot;Hebrews&quot; (1897), in the &quot;Expositors Greek Testament&quot;, Robertson Nicoll Editor, New York, n.d. St. John in Vol 1, p. 7, and Hebrews in Vol 4, p. 9. cited as author
*&quot;The Parables of Our Lord&quot; (1895)
*&quot;Forerunners of Dante&quot;
*&quot;How to Become Like Christ&quot; (1897), Available from Gutenberg
*&quot;The Bible, its Origin and Nature&quot; (1904)
*the &quot;Bross Lectures&quot;, in which he gave an able sketch of the use of Old Testament criticism, and finally set forth his &quot;Theory of Inspiration&quot;.
Apart from his services to Biblical scholarship he takes high rank among those who have sought to bring the results of technical criticism within the reach of the ordinary reader.

<text>The clamorous reed warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) is an Old World warbler in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. It breeds from Egypt eastwards through Pakistan, Afghanistan and northernmost India to south China and southeast Asia. &quot;A. s. meridionalis&quot; is an endemic race in Sri Lanka.

==Subspecies==
Nine subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. s. stentoreus&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1833) – Egypt
* &quot;A. s. levantinus&quot; Roselaar, 1994 – Israel, Jordan, Syria and northwest Arabia
* &quot;A. s. brunnescens&quot; (Jerdon, 1839) – Red Sea region to Kazakhstan and north India
* &quot;A. s. amyae&quot; Baker, ECS, 1922 – northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and south China
* &quot;A. s. meridionalis&quot; (Legge, 1875) – south India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;A. s. harterti&quot; Salomonsen, 1928 – Philippines (except Palawan group and Sulu Archipelago)
* &quot;A. s. siebersi&quot; Salomonsen, 1928 – west Java
* &quot;A. s. celebensis&quot; Heinroth, 1903 – Sulawesi
* &quot;A. s. lentecaptus&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1924 – Borneo and central, east Java to Sumbawa (west Lesser Sunda Islands)

==Description==
Clamorous reed warbler is a large song thrush-sized warbler at 18–20 cm. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and whitish underparts. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers. It is very like the great reed warbler, but that species has richer coloured underparts.

There are a number of races differing in plumage shades. The migratory northern race has the richest brown upperparts, and the endemic Sri Lanka subspecies is the darkest form.

Like most warblers, the clamorous reed warbler is insectivorous, but will take other small prey items.

The song is loud and far-carrying, but less raucous than that of the great reed warbler. It is a slow, chattering &quot;&quot; with typically acrocephaline whistles and mimicry added.

==Habitat==
Most populations are sedentary, but the breeding birds in Pakistan, Afghanistan and north India are migratory, wintering in peninsular India and Sri Lanka.

This passerine bird is a species found in large reed beds, often with some bushes. 3-6 eggs are laid in a basket nest in reeds.

<text>A cur was a dog breed used by cattle drovers in England. The breed is now extinct. In the United States, a short-haired dog used in hunting and herding is called &quot;cur-tailed&quot;, or &quot;cur&quot; for short.

In modern speech, the term &quot;cur&quot; is usually used to describe a mongrel dog, particularly if its temperament is unfriendly or aggressive. The term is believed to be derived from the Old Norse &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;to grumble or growl&#x27;. In Victorian speech, &quot;cur&quot; could be used as an insult.

==English cur==
In England, the cur, also called the drover&#x27;s dog, was a distinct breed of dog used by cattle drovers; they are now extinct. The cur was described by Ralph Beilby and Thomas Bewick in their 1790 work &quot;A general history of quadrupeds&quot;, as well as by Sydenham Edwards in his 1800 &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot;, as dogs principally used by drovers to drive cattle. Curs were described as heelers, nipping the heels of cattle to make them move and ducking below the subsequent kick. They were said to be common in England, particularly the North of England, but were virtually unknown in the rest of the United Kingdom.

The cur was described as being larger, stronger and longer legged than shepherds&#x27; collies with shorter and smoother coats; in colour they were generally black, brindled, or with a white neck and legs and occasionally a white face, they had some feathering on their legs and half-pricked ears. A defining characteristic of the cur was that many were born with short, stumpy tails, which gave the appearance of their having been docked. Edwards described the breed&#x27;s ancestry as likely a mixture of collie, lurcher, English mastiff, or Great Dane. Their character was described as cunning, clever, ever busy and restless; it was said they could differentiate their master&#x27;s cattle from those of strangers, and they would separate the strange cattle from their master&#x27;s herds.

Although it is uncertain when or why the breed became extinct, it likely disappeared in the mid-19th century. Some modern writers believe it was the cur, not the collie, that was crossed with the dingo to create the now-extinct Halls Heeler in Australia. This would make the cur an ancestor of both the Australian cattle dog and the Australian stumpy tail cattle dog, the latter inheriting the cur&#x27;s bobtail.

==American curs==
In the United States, the term cur is also used to describe a distinctive type of short-haired dog that is used for both hunting and herding that was developed in the Southern United States. When describing these dogs, the term is actually an abbreviation of cur-tailed, as in a dog with a naturally occurring bobtail like that of the extinct English cur; many of the earlier examples of this type had a bobtail and some still do. A number of cur breeds have been standardised within the United States, some have been recognised by the United Kennel Club; these breeds include the Black Mouth Cur, the Blue Lacy, the Catahoula Leopard dog, the Mountain Cur, the Stephens Cur, the Treeing Cur, and the Treeing Tennessee Brindle.

These versatile dogs are used in a number of roles: for herding livestock, as well as trailing and locating lost livestock in thick scrubland; and in hunting a variety of game, including squirrels, opossums, raccoons, feral pigs, cougars, and American black bears, locating game both by sight and scent. While distinctive, American curs vary greatly in size; the various breeds and strains can be from in height, and in weight.

<text>Barbara Deming (July 23, 1917 – August 2, 1984) was an American feminist and advocate of nonviolent social change.

== Personal life ==

Barbara Deming was born in New York City. She attended a &quot;Friends&quot; (Quaker) school up through her high school years.

Deming directed plays, taught dramatic literature and wrote and published fiction and non-fiction works. On a trip to India, she began reading Gandhi, and became committed to a non-violent struggle, with her main cause being Women&#x27;s Rights. She later became a journalist, and was active in many demonstrations and marches over issues of peace and civil rights. She was a member of a group that went to Hanoi during the Vietnam War, and was jailed many times for non-violent protest.

Deming died on August 2, 1984.

=== Relationships ===

At sixteen, she had fallen in love with a woman her mother&#x27;s age, and thereafter she was openly lesbian. She was the romantic partner of writer and artist Mary Meigs from 1954 to 1972. Their relationship eventually floundered, partially due to Meigs&#x27;s timid attitude, and Deming&#x27;s unrelenting political activism.

During the time that they were together, Meigs and Deming moved to Wellfleet, Massachusetts, where she befriended the writer and critic Edmund Wilson and his circle of friends. Among them was the Québécois author Marie-Claire Blais, with whom Meigs became romantically involved. Meigs, Blais, and Deming lived together for six years.

In 1976, Deming moved to Florida with her partner, artist Jane Verlaine. Verlaine painted, did figure drawings and illustrated several books written by Deming. Verlaine was a tireless advocate for abused women.

== Life&#x27;s work ==
Deming openly believed that it was often those whom we loved that oppressed us, and that it was necessary to re-invent non-violent struggle every day.

It is often said that she created a body of non-violent theory, based on action and personal experience, that centered on the potential of non-violent struggle in its application to the women&#x27;s movement.

In 1968, Deming signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In 1978, she became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press.

==Money for Women / The Barbara Deming Memorial Fund==
In 1975, Deming founded The Money for Women Fund to support the work of feminist artists. Deming helped administer the Fund, with support from artist Mary Meigs. After Deming&#x27;s death in 1984, the organization was renamed as The Barbara Deming Memorial Fund. Today, the foundation is the &quot;oldest ongoing feminist granting agency&quot; which &quot;gives encouragement and grants to individual feminists in the arts (writers, and visual artists)&quot;.

<text>Fraternity Records is a small record label based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was started by Harry Carlson and silent partner Dr. Ashton Welsh in 1954. The first recording to be released on Fraternity was Jerri Winters&#x27; &quot;Winter&#x27;s Here&quot;.
The first hit was Cathy Carr&#x27;s rendition of a Tin Pan Alley song, &quot;Ivory Tower&quot; in 1956. It made #2, besting a cover version by Otis Williams &amp; the Charms.
A year later came the Jimmy Dorsey #2 charting instrumental &quot;So Rare&quot;, the famous bandleader&#x27;s final hit before his death.
1959 saw another big hit, Bill Parsons&#x27; &quot;The All American Boy&quot;, which also peaked at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts. Parsons was a friend of country singer Bobby Bare and it was actually Bare&#x27;s voice heard on the hit record. Parsons sang on the B-side.
Fraternity also leased songs from smaller labels, including one track by Jackie Shannon (later Jackie DeShannon).

Fraternity&#x27;s biggest-selling hit was Lonnie Mack&#x27;s 1963 guitar instrumental cover of the Chuck Berry song &quot;Memphis&quot;, which rose to #5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Pop chart and #4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s R&amp;B chart.

The final national Top 40 hit for the label was &quot;Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye&quot; by The Casinos, which reached #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart in 1967.

Shad O&#x27;Shea purchased the company from Carlson in 1975.

Applegate Recording Society was also a subsidiary label of Fraternity.

UK reissue label Ace Records Ltd. currently makes a large handful of Fraternity recordings available on compact disc albums and digital downloads, including the original big hits mentioned here.
