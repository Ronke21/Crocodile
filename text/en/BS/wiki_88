<text>The Harvard Classics, originally marketed as Dr. Eliot&#x27;s Five-Foot Shelf of Books, is a 50-volume series of classic works of world literature, important speeches, and historical documents compiled and edited by Harvard University President Charles W. Eliot. Eliot believed that a careful reading of the series and following the eleven reading plans included in Volume 50 would offer a reader, in the comfort of the home, the benefits of a liberal education, entertainment and counsel of history&#x27;s greatest creative minds. The initial success of &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot; was due, in part, to the branding offered by Eliot and Harvard University. Buyers of these sets were apparently attracted to Eliot&#x27;s claims. The General Index contains upwards of 76,000 subject references.

The first 25 volumes were published in 1909 followed by the next 25 volumes in 1910. The collection was enhanced when the &quot;Lectures on The Harvard Classics&quot; was added in 1914 and &quot;Fifteen Minutes a Day - The Reading Guide&quot; in 1916. The &quot;Lectures on The Harvard Classics&quot; was edited by Willam A. Neilson, who had assisted Eliot in the selection and design of the works in Volumes 1–49. Neilson also wrote the introductions and notes for the selections in Volumes 1–49. The Harvard Classics is often described as a &quot;51 volume&quot; set, however, P.F. Collier &amp; Son consistently marketed the Harvard Classics as 50 volumes plus Lectures and a Daily Reading Guide. Both &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot; and &quot;The Five-Foot Shelf of Books&quot; are registered trademarks of P.F. Collier &amp; Son for a series of books used since 1909.

Collier advertised &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot; in U.S. magazines including &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, offering to send a pamphlet to prospective buyers. The pamphlet, entitled &quot;Fifteen Minutes a Day - A Reading Plan&quot;, is a 64-page booklet that describes the benefits of reading, gives the background on the book series, and includes many statements by Eliot about why he undertook the project. In the pamphlet, Eliot states:


== Dr. Eliot&#x27;s Five-Foot Shelf of Books ==
The idea of the Harvard Classics was presented in speeches by then President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard University. Several years prior to 1909, Eliot gave a speech in which he remarked that a three-foot shelf would be sufficient to hold enough books to give a liberal education to anyone who would read them with devotion. He was inundated with requests for the list of those book titles that would fill the three-foot shelf. After many attempts to support his initial claim, he decided that the shelf would need to be lengthened to five feet - but a definitive list of works was not declared. A well-known publisher, Peter Fenelon Collier and his son, Robert J. Collier, saw a financial opportunity and asked that Eliot make good on his statement by selecting 50 volumes (400 to 500 pages each). Collier representatives proposed the name for the series as either &quot;The Harvard Library&quot; or &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot; pending approval by Harvard University. The proposal, presented to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, was unanimously approved as a useful undertaking from an educational point of view.

In February 1909 with his approaching retirement as President of Harvard University, Eliot accepted the proposal of P.F. Collier &amp; Son. The agreement allowed Eliot to engage an assistant. He chose William A. Neilson, Professor of English at Harvard University. The English Bible was excluded because Eliot and Neilson felt that almost every household would already possess at least one copy. The contributions of living authors (other than scientific contributions) were excluded because Eliot and Neilson considered the &quot;verdict of the educated world&quot; was not yet final. Works of modern fiction were felt to be readily accessible and thus excluded. English and American literature as well as documents related to American social and political ideas were more likely to be selected because the Harvard Classics were intended primarily for American readers.

Eliot retired as President of Harvard University in May 1909 and devoted much of the next year to organizing the 50 volumes and selecting the list of included works. The first half of the included works was provided to P.F. Collier &amp; Son in 1909. However, Eliot and Neilson did not make the remaining selections, write the introductions for each selection, or finish the general index until 1910. Consequently, P.F. Collier &amp; Son printed volumes 1 to 25 in 1909 and volumes 26 to 50 in 1910. An advertisement for The Harvard Classics appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on April 30, 1909, stating the &quot;Complete Official Contents Now Ready.&quot; With the help of more than 50 Harvard professors and instructors and the general library of Harvard University and its department libraries, Eliot and Neilson believed that the title &quot;The Harvard Classics&quot; was well deserved.

== Release and marketing ==

In a June 1909 issue of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, P.F. Collier &amp; Son announced it would publish a series of books selected by Eliot, without disclosing the list of included works, that would be approximately five feet in length and would supply the readers a liberal education. A few days after the announced intent to publish Dr. Eliot&#x27;s Five-Foot Shelf of Books, several newspapers published an incomplete list of selected works to be included. Eliot felt the publications were unauthorized and asked Collier&#x27;s Weekly publishers to publish his letter to the editors explaining the initial list and selection process in the July 24, 1909, edition of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. Eliot describes his goal in helping publish The Harvard Classics as motivated by an educational purpose and he explains why the English Bible was not selected. In January 1910, P.F. Collier &amp; Son announced in a &quot;Publishers&#x27; Statement&quot; that the 50 volumes were almost complete and offered a &quot;Statement from the Editor&quot; (Eliot) describing the origins of process resulting in the first sets of The Harvard Classics. The first editions printed by P.F. Collier &amp; Son in three separate styles of bindings were first offered for sale on October 13, 1909.

The collection was marketed so as to advertise in all the principal magazines published in the United States resulting in a combined circulation of almost 3,000,000 for the initial marketing effort. The sales were initiated using 3,000 agents who were supplied a prospectus or &quot;Announcement of The Harvard Classics&quot; so that leads could be followed up by the agents. Most advertisements encouraged an interest notice be mailed back to the publisher offering a targeted and highly successful marketing campaign for the series. The intent by the publisher was to offer The Harvard Classics as a subscription with only some of the volumes being sent initially and the remaining to follow in subsequent shipment. This was strategic since the complete 50 volumes had not yet been supplied by Eliot and Neilson to the publisher and would not be supplied until late in 1910.

== Printing history ==

Volumes 1-49 of The Harvard Classics include reprints of hundreds of authors&#x27; works that may have been in the public domain (e.g., because of expired copyrights) or covered by existing copyright holders such as other publishing companies. In either case, Collier filed copyrights for the 49 volumes and for The Harvard Classics complete series in 1909 and 1910 and obtained, when necessary, permission to reprint selected works included in one of the 49 volumes. Collier&#x27;s copyrighted Volume 50 was in 1910, the &quot;Lectures on The Harvard Classics&quot; in 1914, and &quot;Fifteen Minutes a Day - The Reading Guide&quot; in 1916.

P.F. Collier &amp; Son asserts in many early adverstisements of The Harvard Classics that 20,000 sets of The Harvard Classics were first printed to offer a &quot;tremendous savings&quot; to buyers and that these first printings include the word &quot;Eliot&quot; as a watermark on every page. To help the chronological obsession about the print runs of The Harvard Classics, clues regarding how many of first edition printings are offered in a trademark dispute case between P.F. Collier and E. Milton Jones in 1909 that was later ruled on in appeal in 1910 (in favor of P.F. Collier &amp; Son). In testimony, Robert J. Collier states that the first sets of The Harvard Classics printed and sold were &quot;bound in full morocco...one set, bound in three-quarters morocco...and the remaining set, bound in buckram...&quot;. Advertisements in 1910 also state Collier prepared editions for those who demand luxurious limited editions as well as for the readers who want less expensive sets.

The first editions of The Harvard Classics were known as &quot;De Luxe&quot; sets. Most were limited-quantity print runs and some &quot;autographed&quot; editions (only Volume 1 is autographed) include signatures by Eliot and in some cases Robert J. Collier. The first print runs in 1909 were for volumes 1 to 25. Another print run was needed in 1910 for volumes 26 to 50 because those volumes were not selected and edited by Eliot until the middle of 1910. The first editions include Japanese vellum paper with &quot;Eliot&quot; watermarks (made by S.D. Warren &amp; Co. of Boston), deckled pages, silk moire endpapers, sewn in bookmarks, and top edged gilt pages. Each was appealing to buyers for the elaborate illustrations, frontispieces, plates, portraits, facsimiles, and crimson silk page markers (features unlikely to be found in later printings). The colophon found on the ultimate page of content of first editions notes these sets were &quot;planned and designed by William Patten&quot; (the Book Manager at P.F. Collier &amp; Son).

The exact numbers of each of the three bindings making up the 20,000 first sets are unclear. Four different sets in full morocco leather were printed with raised bands, Harvard University insignia, and volume names in gilt lettering on the spines. The four variations in full leather include: (1) the &quot;Alumni Autograph Edition&quot; limited to 200 numbered sets (Volume 1 is autographed by Eliot), (2) the &quot;Eliot Edition&quot; limited to 1,000 numbered sets (Volume 1 is autographed by Eliot), (3) the &quot;Alumni Edition De Luxe&quot; (unsigned) limited to 1,000 numbered sets, and (4) the &quot;Edition De Luxe&quot; sets that are numbered and stated as being limited editions (but the number printed is not shown). The full morocco sets sold for at least $345. The Edition De Luxe sets in full morocco leather were sold many years (after the limited-quantity runs were sold out) as some include the &quot;Lecture&quot; volume added in 1914.

The second binding type of the first editions of The Harvard Classics were printed in three-quarters morocco leather binding over cloth boards. The first edition three-quarters morocco leather sets have similar variations as the full morocco leather sets including a (1) set limited to 1,000 numbered and autographed &quot;Cambridge Editions&quot; signed by Eliot and, interestingly, the publisher Robert J. Collier also signed the sets numbered from 412 to 973 over mottled cream boards, (2) set limited to 1,000 numbered and autographed &quot;Eliot Edition&quot; books over green cloth boards, and (3) a set limited to 1,000 (unsigned) called the &quot;Alumni Edition&quot; on the spine bound over crimson boards, and (4) a set of unknown number called the &quot;Library Edition&quot; (stated as limited edition, but number of printings is not shown) over crimson boards. The &quot;Library Editions&quot; do not paper with &quot;Eliot&quot; watermarks, but appear to have the same high-quality Japanese vellum paper. Each of these limited-quantity three-quarter morocco sets sold for $195.
The third type of binding of the first editions of The Harvard Classics were printed in fine buckram (green and crimson). The green buckram set of &quot;Alumni Edition&quot; printings is a numbered set limited to 1,000 numbered copies. The green buckram has gilt lettering with crimson and gold Harvard insignia on both the spine and front board. The first editions show &quot;Alumni Edition De Luxe&quot; are numbered and limited to 1,000 sets and include embossed bands on the spine. The remaining first edition set of The Harvard Classics, printed in fine crimson buckram cloth, is another version called the &quot;Eliot Edition&quot; - a limited quantity printing of 1,000. The crimson buckram &quot;Eliot Edition&quot; with Eliot&#x27;s signature on the front board is printed with raised bands on the spine, &quot;Eliot&quot; watermarked pages, and include illustrations, frontispieces, plates, portraits, and facsimiles. This set does not include page markers. Both buckram first edition sets sold for $100. Another set almost identical to the limited-quantity green buckram sets, is also in green buckram and has &quot;Alumni Edition&quot; on the spine. This set was sold for many years and was limited to 10,000 printings. These second print runs of this set are almost identical to the first editions except the pastedown papers have much more faint printings, the limited edition page shows the editions as &quot;Edition De Luxe,&quot; and watermarked &quot;Eliot&quot; pages are not included. 
In 1910, Collier began printing The Harvard Classics in a limited quantity set called the Renaissance edition. This beautifully bound set includes 10 different bindings consisting of reproductions of the artistic bindings of Royal Monarchs of Europe from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. Collier also began printing the National (1910) and Popular (1912) editions with lower price points in an effort, claimed by Collier in many advertisements, to honor the wishes of Eliot that The Harvard Classics are priced within everybody&#x27;s reach. An extremely popular crimson-colored silk cloth set similar to the look of the De Luxe Morocco edition began printing in 1914 and was called the Cambridge edition. Variations of the Cambridge edition were printed for over a decade in cloth over hardboards and later (after 1919) in an imitation leather binding material called fabrikoid.

In 1919 Collier announced a new binding material for The Harvard Classic sets with the printing of a new set called the Southwark edition (in flexible dark green fabrikoid or imitation leather). The first set of the Southwark edition was printed in July 1919 and given to the Du Pont company. The set carries an inscription &quot;This is the first set of Harvard Classics published by P.F. Collier &amp; Son Company to be bound in DuPont Fabrikoid...&quot;. The set was named after the birthplace of one of the founders of Harvard College, John Harvard, who was born in London Borough of Southwark. The set is often referred to as the &quot;Veritas&quot; edition; however, the &quot;Veritas&quot; edition is bound in a dark crimson color promoted by DuPont. The new binding material, called fabrikoid, offered less weight, flexible boards, and bindings that were more durable than the cloth or leather bindings of the early editions. Fabrikoid bindings were used in editions published from the 1920s to 1950&#x27;s such as the varicolored Gemston edition which has five different colors of bindings and for larger editions with increased font sizes called the (home) Library editions that were marketed as being easier to read.
The &quot;Eliot Foundation of Adult Education&quot; set, which appears to have been first printed around 1932 (based on included educational materials dated 1932 and later), is a rare numbered set bound in dark blue pebbled cloth. This set has gold gilt lettering with a profile of Eliot on the spine. The set was the focus of a set of materials for adult education with syllabi, instructions for study, and classroom discussions points. The set has an embossed symbol used in many of the education materials developed by the Eliot Foundation on the front board with &quot;Versitas Scientia Humanitas&quot; (trans. trust, knowledge, and culture). The number of printings of this rare set is unknown. Later editions (with names such as Gemstone, Deluxe Registered, Veritas, Home Library, and Great Literature editions) were not quite as unique as price points were further lowered to make the Harvard Classics more affordable. These later editions were printed in various sizes and binding materials such as cloth, fabrikoid, bonded leather, and even later in various types of imitation and genuine leather often printed to imitate earlier editions.

P.F. Collier &amp; Son printed the 50th edition (that is, different set) of The Harvard Classics in 1956. Owners and prospective buyers of The Harvard Classics editions are often interested in the printing year of a particular edition. As mentioned before, not even the first editions were fully printed in 1909. First editions were printed in 1909 and 1910, and all subsequent editions were printed in 1910 or later. A printer&#x27;s key could be used to describe the print run, but these were not used in the U.S. until the middle of the twentieth century. Copyright dates for book reprints are unlikely to identify the year of printing excepts for first four editions. For The Harvard Classics series, copyright pages of The Harvard Classics have no information about the printing year (or run) until 1956 when the publisher began including information about the year of the print run.

Collier&#x27;s renewed the copyrights for The Harvard Classics 28 years after filing the first copyrights for The Harvard Classics (as was customary at the time, as it offered some legal advantages) in 1936 and 1937. Coliier&#x27;s again renewed the copyrights in 1956 and 1959, and several times in the sixties as editions were printed in different page sizes and fonts (resulting is different pagination than described in initial copyright filings) and because some editions were printed and sold with fewer than 50 volumes. In sum, copyright dates of The Harvard Classics editions offer misleading information about the printing date or printing year after the first editions were printed in 1909 and 1910. For example, print runs following the publications of the first editions and until 1937 include copyrights dates of 1909 or 1910 although the printing year could be over 20 years later (or more).

Some clues about the printing history can help identify the print run year. For example, the inclusion of the &quot;Lectures&quot; began in 1914. Additionally, the &quot;Editor&#x27;s Introduction&quot; in volume 50 includes a second &quot;Editor&#x27;s Introduction&quot; that is dated in 1917. Fabrikoid was first used as binding for The Harvard Classics in 1919. Lastly, the publishing company marketed a larger size of books with the Home Library edition. This set of The Harvard Classics and subsequent editions are 15 percent larger than previous editions. None of these clues allow for an exact printing year, but each can be used to establish that the printing could not have occurred before a certain year, and of course, the printing cannot have occurred before the most recent copyright date.

The last edition of The Harvard Classics printed by P.F. Collier &amp; Son (then a subsidiary of Crowell Collier &amp; Macmillan, Inc.) was the 63rd printing in 1970 of a 22-volume called the &quot;Great Literature Edition&quot; in green fibrated (essentially bonded) leather with 22K decor that sold for $3.78 per volume ($1 each for the first three volumes). The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in 1972 against Crowell Collier for deceptive selling practices of The Harvard Classics. In a statement responding to the complaint, Crowell Collier stated that it no longer sells The Harvard Classics. On March 24, 1973, the FTC provisionally accepted a consent order from Crowell Collier (now called Crowell, Collier and MacMillan, Inc.) that the publisher would stop trying to sell The Harvard Classics in one bulk shipment. The publisher ended the subscription plan used since 1909 and stated that it had no plans to sell The Harvard Classics one book at a time.

== Enduring success ==
As Adam Kirsch, writing for &quot;Harvard&quot; magazine in 2001, notes, &quot;It is surprisingly easy, even today, to find a complete set of the Harvard Classics in good condition. At least one is usually for sale on eBay, the Internet auction site, for $300 or so, a bargain at $6 a book. The supply, from attics or private libraries around the country, seems endless — a tribute to the success of the publisher, P.F. Collier, who sold some 350,000 sets within 20 years of the series&#x27; initial publication&quot;.

Eliot and Neilson concluded that the 50 volumes were &quot;so far as possible, entire works or complete segments of the world&#x27;s written legacies&quot; for English speaking readers.

This led to the publication in 1952 of &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot;, which is still in print and actively marketed.

<text>Reinhard Lettau (10 September 1929, Erfurt – 17 June 1996, Karlsruhe) was a German-American writer. 

== Career ==
He was a professor of German Literature first at Smith College and then, from 1967 to 1991, at the University of California, San Diego. He was an active member of the Group 47. He gave incendiary speeches at the Free University of Berlin denouncing the Springer Press. He was thereupon expelled from East Germany because he was a foreigner—by that time, he carried an American passport. His provocative behavior continued in the US: In 1972, he was suspended from teaching, without pay, at UC San Diego after hitting a Marine Corps officer on the head with a rolled-up newspaper. Lettau objected to the Marines recruiting on campus.

He returned to Germany in 1991 after German reunification. He received the War Blind Prize for radio plays in 1979, the Berlin Literature Prize in 1993, and the Bremen Literature Prize in 1995.

He had studied German, philosophy, and literature in Heidelberg and at Harvard. His dissertation at Harvard in 1960 was titled &quot;Utopie und Roman; Untersuchungen zur Form des deutschen utopischen Romans im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert.&quot; His advisor was Bernhard Blume. The thesis analyzed utopian novels in the 20th century. He later published on Marcuse.

In addition to his academic writing, Lettau was &quot;critically recognized as a major twentieth-century prose stylist.&quot; He was a member of the PEN-Centre in Germany, and of the Deutsche Akademie der Darstellenden Künste. He was Poet in Residence at the University of Essen (Germany) in the winter term 1979/1980.

He married Gene Carter in 1954; they had three daughters, Karin (1957), Kevyn (1959), and Kathy (1965). They were divorced in 1968. He lived from 1965 in Berlin-Schöneberg together with Véronique Springer, the daughter of the Galerist Rudolf Springer. They were married in 1969 after moving to San Diego in 1967. They were divorced in 1972. His third wife was Dawn Teborski; they married in 1979 and returned to Berlin in 1991 after Lettau took early retirement at UC San Diego because of health problems. 

In 1996 he traveled to Karlsruhe for his mother&#x27;s 90th birthday. He was hospitalized after a fall and died there of pneumonia. He is buried in the Protestant Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church (Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde) at Mehringdamm No. 21 in Berlin-Kreuzberg.

== Books ==
His books include:
* &quot;Schwierigkeiten beim Häuserbauen&quot; (1962)
:21 stories of the absurd, or rather, normal situations which become absurd
:American edition: &quot;Obstacles&quot;, Transl.: Ursule Molinaro, New York: Pantheon Books, 1965.
* &quot;Auftritt Manigs&quot; (1963)
:51 short (usually less than one page) descriptions of Manig. We learn a lot about Manig, despite the extremely short but acutely precise observations. The first public reading of this book was at a meeting of the &quot;Gruppe 47&quot; in Berlin October 25–28, 1962.
* &quot;Die Gruppe 47 - Bericht, Kritik, Polemik&quot; (1967)
:Lettau was both a member of the &quot;Gruppe 47&quot; and a keen observer of its working. A group of writers would gather once a year to criticize each other&#x27;s work. Gert Rückel describes a scene towards the end of the group&#x27;s life in which Lettau speaks to a group of protesters.
* &quot;Feinde&quot; (1968)
:Three longer and three short stories. The main story, &quot;Der Feind&quot; is a collection of short, grotesque stories about the senseless absurdity of the military. The first public reading was at a meeting of the &quot;Gruppe 47&quot; in Princeton/USA, April 22–24, 1966. Parts were also printed in Kursbuch 7 (1966)
* &quot;Täglicher Faschismus&quot; (1971)
:Lettau analyzes six months of selected newspaper articles from the USA and discusses the fascist tendencies that he sees in them. Topics are worker&#x27;s problems, the student protests, press manipulation and racism.
* &quot;Immer kürzer werdende Geschichten. Und Gedichte und Porträts.&quot; (1973)
:This is a collection of stories written between 1962 and 1968
* &quot;Fruehstuecksgespraeche im Miami&quot; (1977)
:Where do dictators go when they have been deposed? Well, to Miami, to await the news that they may return. Lettau imagines dictators meeting for breakfast and discussing business. 43 short breakfast discussions on topics ranging from avoiding assassination to the advantages of smoking. A radio play was written by Lettau and the director Walter Adler in the winter of 1978/79 and was produced in February 1979 by the SDR in Stuttgart.
* &quot;Zerstreutes Hinschauen - Vom Schreiben über Vorgänge in direkter Nähe oder in der Entfernung von Schreibtischen&quot; (1980)
:35 short chapters (but long by Lettauesque standards) looking to Germany and to the problems caused by Lettau taking part in a demonstration in Berlin and being deported.
* &quot;Herr Strich schreitet zum Äussersten. Geschichten&quot; (1982)
:This title story was first published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on February 7, 1952. This is a collection of short stories that were published in diverse newspapers and literary journals.
* &quot;Zur Frage der Himmelsrichtungen&quot; (1988)
:What does East mean? Where is West? If you stand in San Francisco and look out over the ocean, you are looking at China and Russia - most certainly the East. If you are in Erfurt (or Berlin!) any way you look - North, South, East or West - is East. 52 short chapters.
* &quot;Flucht vor Gästen&quot; (1994)
:Lettau describes his return to Germany from America with his second wife, Dawn. Five chapters of unnumbered stories about terrible guests and about coming back to Germany.
* &quot;Waldstück im Ansturm&quot;
:This &quot;Noyaux&quot; (fruit pit) of a book that Lettau was working on at the time of his death and tentatively titled &quot;Gramercy Park&quot; was published in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung on November 7, 1995. Lettau read 10 pages for the NDR in Hanover on January 27, 1996.

:A collection of the most important prose stories Lettau published. The editors have tried to be faithful to Lettau&#x27;s at times free orthography and his hatred of commas. As there were no fixed manuscripts but just piles and piles of notes sorted into folder, the editors had quite a lot of work compiling these stories. A second volume is planned. Includes a detailed timeline including the names of his dogs and the addresses at which he lived.

<doc id="558293" wikidata="Q734932" url="?curid=558293" title="Hannibal King">
<text>Hannibal King is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared as a supporting character in the title &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, issue #25 (Oct. 1974).

King was played by Ryan Reynolds in the 2004 film &quot;&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Hannibal King was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Working as a private detective, King was bitten and killed by Deacon Frost while on a case in London, England. Horrified to find himself one of the undead, King vowed never to consummate the curse by passing it on. He subsists on blood purchased or stolen from blood banks and consumes only corpses or animals. For the most part, eschewing his vampirism, King continues to operate as a private detective, travelling freely only by night.

King was introduced when he was seen confronting Dracula, the lord of Earth&#x27;s vampires. While searching for Frost, King eventually met Blade, the vampire hunter, whose mother had been killed by Frost, and together they destroy Frost.

While investigating a friend&#x27;s murder by worshipers of the occult book &quot;Darkhold&quot;, King contacts Doctor Strange. Learning the book contains spells to create and destroy vampires, King goes with Strange, Blade and Frank Drake to Castle Mordo in Transylvania to retrieve it. They battle Dracula and the Darkholders and use the book to cast the Montesi Formula, which destroys Dracula and all other current vampires on Earth and prevents others from existing on the planet. While King is not destroyed, because he had never taken blood from a living human being, Strange still needed to give King a complete blood transfusion, which restores King to human form.

King, Drake and Blade establish a detective agency. They eventually named it Borderline Investigations. Strange manipulates them into combating the supernatural enemies that are emerging as the Montesi Formula weakens. Later, Strange examines King and concludes King had become a &quot;neo-vampire&quot;, a special type with the same abilities and weaknesses of any yet merely craving blood and not needing it to survive In a climactic battle with a one-time vampire king named Varnae, King and Drake are thought to have been killed, but both survived. Blade later finds King in New Orleans, where they team to fight the resurrected Frost. Later, in a two-issue solo series in the comic book &quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot;, King sets up shop in San Francisco, where CIA Agent Tatjana Stiles enlists him to help stop a vampire plot to blackmail the Earth with biochemical weapons. Stiles becomes critically injured, and King gives in to her plea to be saved via becoming a vampire. When he learns she has become a deadly vampire CIA agent, he becomes dispirited, losing interest in his work and retreating into depression.

Later, Blade&#x27;s father Lucas Cross offers a way to restore vampires&#x27; souls at the cost of removing vampires&#x27; strengths. Blade is against this while King is for it, leading the two allies to fight. Blade stakes King, who appears to die, but he quickly returns, and Blade gives him a potion that stops his need to consume blood.

==Powers and abilities==
Hannibal King was once a vampire but was cured. He has retained many of his vampiric abilities. He possesses superhuman speed, strength, and senses. He can withstand and recover from severe physical injury and is nearly ageless, impervious to diseases and poisons, and virtually immortal. He can also instantly hypnotize human victims and fly via directed motion hovering by taking on a mist-like form. He can control rats and uses them to gather information for him during the day. He can also transform into a wolf.

Hannibal also has the weaknesses of a vampire: the need for blood to sustain his existence, the inability to endure direct sunlight, and the standard vampiric vulnerabilities to garlic, silver, and the presence of religious symbols. Beheading, burning, and a wooden stake through the heart would kill him.

Hannibal is an excellent detective, a good marksman with a pistol, and possesses an extraordinary sense of will. He often arms himself with conventional firearms but sometimes uses special ones against supernatural foes.

==Vampirism==
In the first appearance of Hannibal King (&quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #25) and during the events of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; (volume 2) #59-62, King states that he had been a vampire for about five years. During the events in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #520-521, King reveals that he had been a vampire for nearly five decades, indicating that he had been a vampire since around the late 1940s. He has openly stated the first figure to others; King declared the latter figure of five decades only in narration.

In &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #25, the reader is not immediately told that Hannibal is a vampire until the final panel.

It was stated in &quot;Nightstalkers&quot; #1 (Aug. 1992) that King&#x27;s neo-vampire status (craving blood but not needing it to survive, as well as his limited ability to tolerate sunlight) was because he never directly consumes blood from a living human, which is also how he stays the Montesi Formula. However, this neo-vampire condition was never alluded to again after his seeming death in &quot;Nightstalkers&quot; #18 (April 1994). After that, he was shown to be a regular vampire with all of the traditional strengths and weaknesses, identical to his status before the Montesi Formula was cast.

==In other media==

Hannibal King appears in &quot;&quot; (2004), portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. This version is a wisecracking yet combat ready member of a vampire hunting group known as the Nightstalkers allied with Blade and led by Abigail Whistler, a character created for the film and based on a recurring character from the film franchise. The film includes the premise that King is a former vampire, having been turned by Danica Talos, and cured by the retrovirus serum that was developed in &quot;Blade&quot; (1998).

Reynolds has said that his performance reminded a rival executive of Marvel antihero Deadpool. The exec is said to have told Reynolds, &quot;Trust me, if they ever make a movie about Deadpool, you&#x27;re the only guy who can play Deadpool,&quot; and sent Reynolds a copy of the comic, &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; #2, in which Deadpool refers to his own scarred appearance as &quot;Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei.&quot; When Reynolds read that comic that name-dropped him, he fell in love with the character and was driven to bring him to the films.

==Reception==
Hannibal King was ranked #25 on a listing of Marvel Comics&#x27; monster characters in 2015.

In 2021, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Hannibal King in their &quot;Marvel: 10 Most Powerful Vampires&quot; list.

<doc id="558295" wikidata="Q7373024" url="?curid=558295" title="Roy Kellerman">
<text>Roy Herman Kellerman (March 14, 1915 – March 22, 1984) was a U.S. Secret Service senior agent who was assigned to protect United States President John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas. In his reports, later testimony and interviews, Kellerman outlines in detail his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination.

==History==
Kellerman, a New Baltimore, Michigan native, graduated from high school in 1933 and worked for the Dodge division of Chrysler sporadically from 1935 until 1937 when he was sworn in as a trooper for the Michigan State Police. Kellerman joined the Secret Service in Detroit just before Christmas 1941, transferring temporarily to the White House detail in March 1942 and permanently one month later. In 1965, Kellerman was promoted to &quot;deputy special agent in charge&quot;, replacing Floyd Boring. He retired from the Secret Service in 1968 as an assistant administrator.

Kellerman died in St. Petersburg, Florida, on March 22, 1984, eight days after his 69th birthday.

==Assassination of John F. Kennedy==
As the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of November 22, 1963, Shift Team No. 3, Kellerman was riding in the front passenger seat of the presidential limousine. The driver was Secret Service Agent William Greer. Like all Secret Service agents assigned to protect the President of the United States, Kellerman was trained to use his own body as a shield, taking a bullet if necessary in the line of duty.

Kellerman along with Secret Service agents William Greer, Clint Hill, and Rufus Youngblood, provided testimony to the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C., on March 9, 1964.

Kellerman testified, &quot;I turned around to find out what happened when two additional shots rang out and the President slumped into Mrs. Kennedy&#x27;s lap and Governor Connally fell to Mrs. Connally&#x27;s lap.&quot; He further testified to the Warren Commission that he first heard what sounded like a &quot;pop&quot; or a &quot;firecracker&quot; somewhere to his right and about five seconds later the assassination then ended in a &quot;flurry of shells&quot; coming into the limousine. He described the final shots as &quot;like a plane going through a sound barrier; bang bang&quot;. During his testimony he said: &quot;If President Kennedy had from all reports four wounds, Governor Connally three, there have got to be more than three shots, gentlemen.&quot;. Kellerman stated that at the hospital he observed that a part of Kennedy&#x27;s right rear skull was missing, with a hole measuring 5 inches in diameter.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations declared in 1979 that &quot;the Secret Service was deficient in the performance of its duties&quot; at the time of the assassination, and that President Kennedy did not receive adequate protection in Dallas. Regarding the conduct of Secret Service Agent Roy Kellerman, the HSCA noted:

No actions were taken by the agent in the right front seat of the Presidential limousine [Roy Kellerman] to cover the President with his body, although it would have been consistent with Secret Service procedure for him to have done so. The primary function of the agent was to remain at all times in close proximity to the President in the event of such emergencies.

According to an interview given in 1981 after John Hinckley, Jr.&#x27;s attempt to assassinate President Reagan in 1981, Kellerman did not believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. However, in 1994, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published an article by Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan in which they quoted Kellerman&#x27;s widow, June, as stating he &quot;accepted that there was a conspiracy.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 2013 film &quot;Parkland&quot;, actor Tom Welling played the role of Kellerman.

<text>Operation Green () often also referred to as Case Green () or Plan Green (), was a full-scale operations plan for a Nazi German invasion of Ireland planned by an unknown German officer known by the alias &quot;Hadel&quot; in support of Operation Sea Lion (), the invasion of the United Kingdom, during World War II. Despite its detailed nature, Operation Green is thought to have been designed only as a credible threat, a feint, not an actual operation. The British government, in secret liaison with the Irish government, drafted Plan W, a planned occupation of the Irish Free State by British forces to counteract a potential German invasion.

German interest in Green and Operation Sea Lion must always be understood in the context of their overall strategic plan. That, first and foremost, was Operation Barbarossa, the invasion and destruction of the Soviet Union. They had little interest in tying up military resources in Britain or France, other than doing what was necessary to prevent the British and French from interfering with the invasion of the Soviet Union.

Implementation of Green was the responsibility of &quot;General der Artillerie&quot; Leonhard Kaupisch, commander of the German Fourth and Seventh Army Corps, Army Group B. The originator of the idea for Green is thought to be newly promoted &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Fedor von Bock, Army Group B. Bock had operational command for the western flank under Operation Sea Lion. Once collated, thirty-two copies of Green were distributed as &quot;Top Secret&quot; on 8 August 1940 to the German High Command; a number of copies survived World War II.

==Deception or a real plan?==
Green was conceived in early-to mid-1940 and the plan was drawn up in August 1940, under three weeks after Hitler issued his initial warning order for Operation Sea Lion on 16 July 1940. The plan was widely circulated and even publicised during the period 1940–1941. By 1942 Green had even made its way into the hands of the Irish military via the British military and was subsequently translated into English by Irish Military Intelligence G2 Branch. This has raised suspicion that intercepted &#x27;chatter&#x27; about Green may have been aimed at creating a &#x27;bogeyman&#x27; in the minds of British military planners on their western flank. There was some truth to this; one example is Generalmajor Walter Warlimont&#x27;s recollection from 28 June 1940 of an operational instruction issued by the High Command. The directive was to mislead the enemy about a possible invasion of neutral Ireland using &quot;all available information media&quot;. The intention was to spread rumours that German forces were preparing a landing in Ireland to place a further stranglehold on Britain, reinforcing the current &quot;siege&quot;. It is possible that these efforts heightened the state of alert and were a cause of alarm in Britain, leading to the British expending significant effort in trying to convince the Irish government to abandon neutrality and side with the Allies.

===Raeder&#x27;s estimation===
The estimation of Grand Admiral Erich Raeder of the Naval High Command was lukewarm, just as it had been for Sea Lion. His concern was German naval strength and resupply of any landed troops:To a defending force, cut off and left to its own devices, the topography of the country [Ireland] does not afford us much protection... without supplies and reinforcements they would soon feel the increasing pressure of British expeditionary force brought over under the protection of British naval power; sooner or later our own troops would face a situation similar to Namsos or Dunkirk.

In this sense Green can be seen as a worst-case scenario for the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). While Kaupisch was to continue planning and training for Sea Lion/Green he seems to have shelved preparations in late 1940 and not returned to them. From his point of view Green had become a feint. This view is reinforced by examining one of the warnings offered to participating German forces in the plan:
The &#x27;Green&#x27; operation confronts us with an entirely new task. Therefore there are no precedents from which we can work. In many cases, troops will have to look after themselves. Each commander must look for a way to achieve his individual objective. Everything depends on the extent of co-operation, on each individual&#x27;s alertness and ability to take independent action. Confidence in the achievements of German Leadership and the German Soldier should be the foundation of this operation.

The prognosis for German land forces taking part in Green was therefore not good. They had no experience of large-scale amphibious warfare; they might have to fight and survive, without resupply, artillery support or screening aerial support, amongst a hostile citizenry. They would have to fight against expected British troop movements from the north of the island, and from Great Britain invading Ireland to protect its flank. These drawbacks, whilst probably acceptable to Hitler, were not acceptable to Raeder in his considered estimation four months after the plan was first floated. He did not agree that Ireland could become the &quot;back door&quot; into Britain with the present strength of German forces.

As Sea Lion was rescheduled on 12 October 1940 for the Spring of 1941, then permanently cancelled on 13 February 1943, Green became an irrelevance.

==Accuracy and detail of Green==

Despite the fact that Abwehr intelligence-gathering in Ireland had not begun until mid-1939, Green was thorough in detail. This can probably be attributed to the intelligence-gathering of German civilians based in Ireland during the 1930s. That the plan for Green was completed days after being ordered is a testament to the planning staff in collating the data. Hitler, who continued to hold out hope for a détente with Britain, refused to allow the Abwehr to conduct intelligence gathering operations on British soil from 1936 to 1938. Even when intelligence gathering operations in Britain were attempted following the fall of France it was mostly disastrous (see Operation Lobster I and Operation Seagull). As Sea Lion was postponed and eventually shelved following the launching of Operation Barbarossa, the planning staff working on it issued two reprints, adding detail as they went.

===Detail in Green===
The full briefing package for Green runs to five volumes, each devoted to a particular area of military interest. A good example of the detail is a seventy five-page booklet titled &quot;Militärgeographische Angaben über Irland&quot; (&quot;Military Geographical data on Ireland&quot;). This booklet described the frontier, size, historical background, industry, transport infrastructure, vegetation, climate, and weather of the island. It also included seventeen pages of detailed sketches of 233 cities, towns, and villages, complete with a lexicon. 120 photos accompanied the booklet; annexes contained street maps of twenty-five cities and towns, including street names and addresses of garage owners.

A second print of the plan in October 1941 added 332 photographs of the Irish countryside and coastline, mostly tourist photos, which were used to reference highly accurate Ordnance Survey maps. There were also details on spring tides, geological formations and possible routes German troops could take off projected invasion beaches. Another addendum included in the further reprinting of the plan in 1942 by the OKL (Luftwaffe High Command), titled &quot;Küsten-Beschreibung des Irischen Freistaates (Irland)&quot; (&quot;Coastal description of the Irish Free State&quot;), contained high-altitude aerial photographs of the areas in question, some taken from 30,000 feet, with houses and trees visible.

Despite this attention to detail, and the improvements in the volume of data with each reprinting, a lot of the data was out of date or incomplete. For example, the Galway–Clifden railway is described as being operational, but it had closed in 1935. Ireland was also described as perfectly suited to military operations because of its &quot;excellent network of roads&quot;, and details on population centres such as Derry and Belfast were accurate but lacked information on British troop concentrations based in these cities. On the other hand, the Ardnacrusha power station on the lower River Shannon was entirely detailed in the plan, thanks to the help of the German firm Siemens, which had built it prior to the war.

==Military details of Plan Green==
Green is often confused with a plan authored by the Irish Republican Army and sent to German Intelligence (Abwehr) in August 1940. The IRA authored plan was later titled &quot;Plan Kathleen&quot; by the Abwehr and &quot;Operation Artus&quot; by the German Foreign Ministry. Green and Plan Kathleen should not be confused. There are no details in Green on the politics of Ireland, only military capacity estimates. Green makes no mention of the IRA in these estimates, and even if the planners had wanted to include detail and estimates of the IRA they probably would not have gained much accurate information from the Abwehr.

===Green within Sea Lion framework===

Leaving aside the possible propaganda and tactical aims of Green, the military planning aspects of Green are best considered as complementing the aims of Sea Lion. In pursuit of Sea Lion, Plan Green was thought to meet a number of military objectives:
* to draw off British Army troops stationed in Northern Ireland who might otherwise be sent to aid the defence of Britain,
* deny Ireland as a staging point/refuge to British troops,
* provide a staging post for Luftwaffe forces to subdue northern Britain.

In the event of Operation Sea Lion&#x27;s success, fulfilment of Operation Green was expected to be the next step, insofar as operational plans stay static during wartime. No plans were made for the imposition of Nazi government in Ireland, but the &quot;rounding up of [Irish] dissidents&quot; were included as part of the operation. Dublin was mentioned as one of six German administrative headquarters between the two islands that were to be established on the successful completion of Sea Lion.

===Implementation and objectives of the plan===
The jumping off point for Green was to be the French ports of Lorient, Saint-Nazaire, and Nantes with an initial force of 3,900 troops. The objective was to be an eighty-five-mile stretch of the southern coast of Ireland between Wexford and Dungarvan. Having captured the ports there, German units were expected to fight their way up to thirty miles inland to establish a beach-head running from Gorey on the Wexford-Dublin road across the 2,610 feet height of Mount Leinster above Borris, County Carlow, through Thomastown in County Kilkenny, to Clonmel in County Tipperary.

The first landings were to include artillery and commando squadrons and a motorised infantry battalion. A bridge building battalion was also to be landed along with three anti-aircraft companies and several &#x27;raiding patrols&#x27; to probe Irish Army defences. Reserves from the German 61st, 72nd, and 290th Divisions were to take up occupation duties in the Gorey-Dungarvan bridgehead once it had been established. The overall details for the plan appear to be sketchy from this point onwards, and mostly would have depended on the success or failure of Operation Sea Lion in Britain.

===Amphibious assault===
Beach-heads considered in Green included the Waterford-Wexford sector (favoured), the estuary of the River Shannon near Limerick, Galway Bay, Donegal Bay with Killala, Ballina and Sligo, Lough Foyle with Derry, the &#x27;Bay of Belfast&#x27; (Belfast Lough), and Cobh in Cork.

The landings were to be effected by sea craft available in occupied France at the time, but there were few in existence and Operation Sea Lion was to have priority- further reasons why Raeder was not happy with Green. Green was expected to use over 50,000 German troops and Sea Lion was expected to use 160,000 but for Green the Germans only found two steamships available around the north-western ports of France- the French &quot;Versailles&quot; and the German &quot;Eule&quot; together with three small coasters: &quot;Mebillo&quot;, &quot;Clio&quot; and &quot;Franzine&quot;.

It is also worth pointing out that to get to Ireland the departing ships would have had to circumnavigate the British coastline at Cornwall. Every vessel taking part in Green was to carry anti-aircraft weaponry indicating that the planners expected the Royal Air Force (RAF) to intercept them, although air cover from the Luftwaffe&#x27;s West of France Air Command was to be provided as part of Sea Lion.

==Irish defences against Green==

It was anticipated that Irish forces would resist the initial invasion. Landing craft and vessels transporting the German troops were to be equipped with forward-facing guns, and invading troops were instructed to assume defensive positions as soon as they came under fire, considering retreat only in the most dire emergency.

There were gaps in the German planning; for instance the plans for the proposed incursion of Cobh (as a possible beach-head area in Green) is not accompanied by details of the 9.2 inch and 6 inch artillery defences located there. This weaponry had formed part of the defences of the Treaty Ports, which the British had handed over to Irish forces in 1938.

Green dealt only with the plan for invasion, as no details on any subjugation of the population and eventual conquest of the entire island were included. Among the Irish population, however, there was a degree of support for Nazi Germany due to a variety of reasons, including resentment of past British rule and the recent partition of the country. Sketchiness with regards to the plan has contributed to an assessment that it was more a diversionary attack than an actual attempt to take over the island. Although, once committed it may have been hard for German forces to withdraw.

==Involvement of the IRA==
There was no involvement or prior knowledge of Green by the IRA in Ireland. It is likely, however, that the possibility of such planning was on the mind of Sean Russell and his acting Chief of Staff Stephen Hayes. Russell is known to have reached out to the German Foreign Ministry and Abwehr during his time in Berlin, and Hayes is known to have sanctioned Plan Kathleen before it was delivered to the Abwehr in Berlin in August 1940. However, no operational instructions were issued to Abwehr agents to gather data on Ireland in preparation for Green. This is possibly because the planners felt they had enough militarily useful data already, but likely because Green, although thorough, was created in a hurry. Later editions contained no data from the IRA, instead only adding from publicly available information in reference books and details provided by German civilians who had worked in Ireland during the 1930s.

<text>Garden State is a 2004 American romantic comedy drama film, written and directed by Zach Braff, and starring him, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm. The film centers on Andrew Largeman (Braff), a 26-year-old actor/waiter who returns to his hometown in New Jersey after his mother dies. Braff based the film on his real life experiences. It was filmed in April and May 2003 and released on July 28, 2004. New Jersey was the main setting and primary shooting location.

&quot;Garden State&quot; received positive reviews and was a box office success. It was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival. The film&#x27;s soundtrack, selected by Braff, won a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.

== Plot ==
Struggling actor Andrew Largeman wakes up from a dream—in which he apathetically sits on a crashing plane—to a telephone message from his father, telling Andrew that he needs to return home because his mother has died.

Andrew leaves Los Angeles and returns home to New Jersey to attend the funeral. He recognizes the grave-diggers as old friends Mark and Dave, who invite him to a party that night. At home, Andrew&#x27;s father gets him a doctor&#x27;s appointment for headaches that he has been having.

Later that night, Andrew goes to the party where he meets up with Mark, Dave, and Jesse, an old friend who has just earned a fortune after creating silent Velcro. After smoking marijuana and taking ecstasy at the party, he still remains detached.

The morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to the appointment. In the waiting room, he meets a young woman named Sam, who is a pathological liar. She later explains that most times she does not know why she lies and will always admit to them afterward. In Andrew&#x27;s meeting with his doctor, it is revealed that Andrew has been on lithium and other mood stabilizers, as well as antidepressants, since the age of 10, but has recently stopped taking them. He also says that his father, who is his psychiatrist, put him on the medications. Andrew finds Sam outside the office and offers her a ride home. Sam invites him into her house, where he meets her mother, who inadvertently reveals that Sam has epilepsy. Andrew tells Sam of his mother&#x27;s death, and Sam tearfully eulogizes her hamster. After returning home, Andrew&#x27;s father confronts him and is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves.

Later, Andrew and Jesse sit in the cemetery as Mark digs another grave. Andrew observes Mark stealing jewelry from the corpse he is burying. Andrew then returns to Sam&#x27;s house, and the two spend the rest of the day together, joining his friends later at Jesse&#x27;s mansion. Andrew tells Sam that he pushed his mother in frustration when he was nine years old, knocking her over a broken dishwasher and leaving her paraplegic; he says that his father blames him for his mother&#x27;s paralysis and put him on medication to &quot;curb the anger&quot; he supposedly harbors. Sam listens, and Andrew admits his feelings for her.

The next day, Mark tells Andrew that he needs help &quot;tracking down&quot; a going-away present for him. Sam, Andrew, and Mark spend the day together, ending it in a quarry in Newark where Mark talks to a man named Albert, who is employed in keeping intruders out of the quarry. The three discuss the reasons why Albert and his wife choose to live in the quarry. Albert explains that living there and exploring the quarry is &quot;doing something that&#x27;s completely unique, that&#x27;s never been done before,&quot; mirroring an earlier speech by Sam. Finally, Albert explains that what actually matters is living with his family. Andrew is inspired by the conversation, and outside in the rain, he climbs atop a derelict crane and screams into the quarry, joined by Sam and Mark. He and Sam then share a kiss.

When Sam and Andrew look at the gift later on, it turns out to be Andrew&#x27;s mother&#x27;s favorite pendant, one of the items Mark stole from her grave, sold, and subsequently located. Andrew eventually talks with his father, and states that he was not to blame for his mother&#x27;s accident and that he will live the rest of his life without medication. He forgives his father and says he wants to build a better relationship with him.

The morning after, Andrew says his goodbyes to Sam at the airport while she begs him not to leave. He acknowledges that she has changed his life but also recognizes that he still has to fix his personal problems before continuing the relationship. Andrew boards the flight, and Sam is left crying in a telephone booth. Andrew, changing his mind, returns to Sam and says he does not want to waste any more of his life without her. He wonders what to do next, and the two then kiss.

== Cast ==
* Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman, a depressed, heavily medicated, struggling young actor who waits tables in a Vietnamese restaurant. When he was nine years old, he accidentally paralyzed his mother by pushing her over a dishwasher door. He has not cried or felt any significant emotions for several years, mainly as a result of the medication he has been supplied with by his estranged father.
* Natalie Portman as Samantha &quot;Sam&quot;, an eccentric epileptic and compulsive liar, who openly admits to her casual dishonesty and frequently ponders what makes her do it.

== Production ==
&quot;Garden State&quot; was Braff&#x27;s feature directing and writing debut. The title of the film was originally intended to be &quot;Large&#x27;s Ark&quot;, in reference to Braff&#x27;s character (note that Albert mentions his own ark in the movie), but he changed it because no one understood what it meant. The title alludes both to the nickname for New Jersey, and lines from Andrew Marvell&#x27;s poem &quot;The Garden&quot; (&quot;Such was that happy garden-state/While man there walked without a mate&quot;).

&quot;Garden State&quot; was filmed over 25 days in April and May 2003, with a budget of $2.5 million; much of it was provided by Gary Gilbert, a co-founder of Rocket Mortgage and first-time film producer. Most of the film was shot on location in Braff&#x27;s hometown of South Orange, New Jersey, with filming also taking place at Cranford, Livingston, Maplewood, Newark, Tenafly, Mahwah, and Wallington as well as New York City and Los Angeles.

Braff has cited such films as &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, Woody Allen films (specifically &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot;), and the films of Alexander Payne as influences on &quot;Garden State&quot;.

== Music ==

The music that accompanied the film was hand-picked by Braff. Commenting on the selections, he said that &quot;Essentially, I made a mix CD with all of the music that I felt was scoring my life at the time I was writing the screenplay.&quot;

Braff won a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. The film&#x27;s trailer won an award for Best Music at the Golden Trailer Awards. The Broadcast Film Critics Association nominated it for Best Soundtrack at the 10th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards.

== Themes ==
The protagonist&#x27;s father has been &quot;protecting&quot; him from his own feelings with pills, namely lithium carbonate. Braff describes the themes of the movie as &quot;love, for lack of a better term. And it&#x27;s a movie about awakening. It&#x27;s a movie about taking action. It&#x27;s a movie about how life is short, go for it now. My character says, &#x27;I&#x27;m 26 years old, and I&#x27;ve spent my whole life waiting for something else to start. Now I realize that this is all there is, and I&#x27;m going to try to live my life like that&#x27;&quot;. &quot;I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties,&quot; he says. &quot;[Andrew] is dealing with issues that you are going through all the time going into your thirties. He&#x27;s lost and lonesome, which is something I definitely felt in my twenties&quot;.

The film is partly autobiographical, depicting Braff&#x27;s own emotions while he was writing the screenplay. He described that &quot;When I wrote &quot;Garden State&quot;, I was completely depressed, waiting tables and lonesome as I&#x27;ve ever been in my life. The script was a way for me to articulate what I was feeling; alone, isolated, &#x27;a dime a dozen&#x27; and homesick for a place that didn&#x27;t even exist.&quot;

== Release ==
The film was first screened on January 16, 2004, at the Sundance Film Festival where it was purchased in a joint venture by Fox Searchlight Pictures and Miramax for $5 million, double the film&#x27;s budget. Fox Searchlight Pictures president Peter Rice said of the film, &quot;Having enjoyed the film immensely, we look forward to working with Miramax to bring &quot;Garden State&quot; to audiences worldwide.&quot;

From March until mid July, it screened at other film festivals until it received a limited release on July 28 in North America. It became only the fourth non-documentary feature to top the chart that year, as calculated by per screen average, since Memorial Day weekend.

Stephen Gilula, president of distribution at Fox Searchlight, attributed the film&#x27;s gradual success to word of mouth and a publicity tour by Braff leading up to the film&#x27;s theatrical debut. Gilula said, &quot;Zach [Braff] had a cross-country tour, and we [organized] word of mouth screenings, where we had to turn people away. Zach did Q&amp;As following [the screenings].&quot; The film went into a limited general release in July 28, 2024, expanding over the following weeks to wider release domestically and in over 20 countries.

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Garden State&quot; grossed $26.8million domestically (United States and Canada), and $9.0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $35.8million, against a budget of $2.5million. After a limited theatrical release (less than 40 theatres over its first three weeks), it went into wide release in its fifth week, when it also reached the Top10 at the domestic box office for the first of two non-consecutive weeks.

===Critical response===

Peter Debruge of &quot;Premiere&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Garden State&quot; gets it. Not since &quot;The Graduate&quot; has a movie nailed the beautiful terror of standing on the brink of adulthood with such satisfying precision.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: &quot;This is not a perfect movie; it meanders and ambles and makes puzzling detours. But it&#x27;s smart and unconventional, with a good eye for the perfect detail.&quot;

Some reviews were more mixed. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Feels too piecemeal and ultimately inconsequential.&quot; Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Garden State&quot; coasts on this considerable charm until it hits a brick wall in its final segments&quot;.

===Manic Pixie Dream Girl===
Natalie Portman&#x27;s character Sam has been used as an example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope, a term that was coined soon after &quot;Garden State&quot; was released, though in reference to another movie.

==Accolades==

&quot;Empire&quot; placed &quot;Garden State&quot; at number 393 on their list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time. In 2014, Jon Dolan of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to &quot;Garden State&quot; as the film &quot;that helped make Hollywood safe for indie pop&quot;.

In addition to being a nominee for the Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, Braff received Best New Director from the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Florida Film Critics Circle&#x27;s Pauline Kael Breakout Award, Best Debut Director Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, Breakout of the Year from the Phoenix Film Critics Society, and Hollywood Breakthrough Director of the Year Award at the Hollywood Film Festival.

==Home media==
After its limited release in theaters, the film gained more popularity during its DVD release on December 28, 2004, which includes commentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes.

It was first released on Blu-ray in the UK on February 19, 2012. The Blu-ray was released in the US on March 4, 2014.

<text>A splatbook is a sourcebook for a particular role-playing game (RPG) that is not needed for play, but is devoted to a particular facet, character class, or fictional faction, providing additional background details and rules options. For example, a &quot;swords and sorcery&quot; fantasy game might offer splatbooks for each of the races in the setting: humans, dwarves, elves, and others.

==History==
===Origins===
The term &quot;splatbook&quot; arose in the 1990s. It originally described the sourcebooks published in the early 1990s by White Wolf Game Studio for its World of Darkness games. Many of these books were titled using similar patterns: &quot;clan&quot;books in &quot;&quot;, &quot;tribe&quot;books for &quot;&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;books for &quot;&quot;, and so forth. In newsgroups, these were called *books (the asterisk on a computer keyboard being used as a wildcard character). Since the asterisk is also known as a &quot;splat&quot;, this gave rise to the term &quot;splatbook&quot;.

===Modern usage===
The term &quot;splatbook&quot; is now used to describe a range of sourcebooks, including those which predated the term. Shannon Appelcline and Stu Horvath have cited the 1978 book &quot;Mercenary,&quot; created for the science fiction RPG &quot;Traveller&quot;, and the 1979 sourcebook &quot;Cults of Prax&quot;, created for the fantasy RPG &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, as examples of the splatbook format which preceded its definition. Other examples include &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; books such as the &quot;Complete&quot; series (&quot;The Complete Book of Dwarves&quot;, &quot;Complete Arcane&quot;, etc.), or the numerous codices for &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; and &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. By extension, the term &quot;splat&quot; is used for the character class described in a splatbook.

<text>XTRMNTR (pronounced &quot;Exterminator&quot;) is the sixth studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was first released on 31 January 2000 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and on 2 May 2000 in the United States by Astralwerks. It peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart.

In a departure from their earlier, more hedonistic recordings, the band took a more political stance on the album, attacking government, police, and multinational corporations. Its sound is more aggressive and forceful than Primal Scream&#x27;s previous output, with noisy, harsh, electronic sounds reminiscent of industrial music forming the basis for many of its songs. Although Gary Mounfield (aka Mani) joined the band in 1997 and recorded a selection of tracks on their previous album &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (1997), it marked the first time he shared songwriting credits with them, as well as his first full album since his time with The Stone Roses.

Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine was seen as a &quot;semi-permanent member&quot; of the band around the release of the album by performing live, helping producing the album and playing on songs. The album also features contributions from The Chemical Brothers and Bernard Sumner of New Order.

The album is notable for being the final full-length release on Creation Records, with the track &quot;Accelerator&quot; later lifted to become the final single released on the label.

==Critical reception==

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 90, based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; magazine rated &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; #2 in its &quot;Top 50 Albums of the Year 2000&quot;, and later at the NME Carling Awards 2001, it won &quot;Best Album&quot; of the year. &quot;Uncut&quot;, like NME, named it at #2 on their list of the best albums of 2000.

Over the years, it has gathered more praise, including appearances on lists of the top albums of the 2000s: &quot;NME&quot; placed it at #3 of their top 50 albums of decade list and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at #142 in its &quot;Top 200 Albums of the 2000s&quot; list. Metacritic placed it at #20 of the 40 best reviewed albums released 2000–9. In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named it as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;. Praising the production, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; included the album on their 2006 list of the &quot;Top Ten Best Sounding Records, 1997–Present&quot;, and later ranked the album at number 10 on their &quot;Stylus Decade&quot; list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 2000s&quot;.

In October 2011, &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Swastika Eyes&quot; at #45 and &quot;Accelerator&quot; at #114 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. In 2014, they ranked &quot;Shoot Speed/Kill Light&quot; at #190 and &quot;Accelerator&quot; at #497 and in their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

Referring to the 2013 update, the album ranks at number 160 in NME&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In 2019, the album was ranked 65th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list.

<doc id="558348" wikidata="Q7326622" url="?curid=558348" title="Richard Hurndall">
<text>Richard Gibbon Hurndall (3 November 1910 – 13 April 1984) was an English actor. He is best remembered for replacing William Hartnell in the role of the First Doctor for &quot;Doctor Who&#x27;s&quot; 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;.

==Career==

===BBC radio===
Hurndall was born in Darlington and he attended Claremont Preparatory School, Darlington and Scarborough College, before training as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He then appeared in several plays at Stratford-upon-Avon. Hurndall acted with the BBC radio drama repertory company from 1949 to 1952. In 1959, he played Sherlock Holmes in a five part adaptation of &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;. He continued to play roles on BBC radio until about 1980, often as the leading man.

===Radio Luxembourg===
In 1958 he became the third host of the Radio Luxembourg program called &quot;This I Believe&quot;. (This show had originally been hosted by Edward R. Murrow on the U.S. CBS Radio Network from 1951 to 1955 and it was then edited in London for rebroadcast on 208 with a British style of presentation at 9:30 PM on Sunday evenings.)

===Television work===
Hurndall appeared in numerous radio and stage plays, films and television series over the course of his lengthy career. He appeared in &#x27;Someone at the Door&#x27;, a 1949 live broadcast TV comedy/thriller, which also featured Patrick Troughton (with whom he was later to appear in Doctor Who – see below). Other television shows of the era that he appeared in include &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, &quot;Whodunnit!&quot; and &quot;Bergerac&quot;. He played the suave London gangster Mackelson in the gritty 1968 drama series &quot;Spindoe&quot; and the following year had a recurring role as flawed senior civil servant Jason Fowler in the final series of &quot;The Power Game&quot;. He appeared in the comedy series &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; in 1970 as Timothy, a gay antique dealer who takes a shine to Harold Steptoe, in Any Old Iron (series 5 episode 3, 20 March 1970). He guest starred in the third series of &quot;Callan&quot;. He appeared twice in the series &quot;Public Eye&quot;, first playing a distinguished entomologist who is unwilling to trace his missing son in &quot;The Golden Boy&quot; (10 January 1973) and later a priest in &quot;How About a Cup of Tea?&quot; (13 January 1975). He was Lord Montdore in &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; (1980).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
In 1983, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the BBC science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, producer John Nathan-Turner planned a special event, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, a 90-minute episode to feature four of the five actors who had at that point played the role of the Doctor. William Hartnell, the actor who originated the role, had died in 1975. Hurndall eventually won the role of the First Doctor, playing him as &quot;acerbic and temperamental but in some ways wiser than his successors.&quot; His casting in the role was approved by Hartnell&#x27;s widow, Heather. When Tom Baker, who played the Fourth Doctor, declined to appear in the programme, Hurndall&#x27;s role was expanded slightly to have the First Doctor take a greater part in the action. It was hoped Hurndall would reprise his portrayal of the First Doctor alongside the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan Foreman, played by Carole Ann Ford, in the season 22 story &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, but Hurndall&#x27;s death saw the storyline adjusted to feature the Second Doctor played by Patrick Troughton and Jamie McCrimmon played by Frazer Hines.

===Films===
His films included &quot;Joanna&quot; (1968), &quot;Hostile Witness&quot; (1968), &quot;Some Girls Do&quot; (1969), &quot;Zeppelin&quot; (1971), &quot;I, Monster&quot; (1971), &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972), &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975), and &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1977).

==Death==
In April 1984, Hurndall died of a heart attack at the age of 73 in London, less than five months after the first broadcast of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. Many sources, including Elisabeth Sladen&#x27;s autobiography, state that he died before being paid for the role. However, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; writer Richard Bignell claims that this isn&#x27;t true, saying &quot;Hurndall had five different payments made out to him ... (four contractual, one expenses) and all were paid in 1982 and 1983, way before his death.&quot;

<text>The NASA X-43 was an experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft with multiple planned scale variations meant to test various aspects of hypersonic flight. It was part of the X-plane series and specifically of NASA&#x27;s Hyper-X program developed in the late 1990s. It set several airspeed records for jet aircraft. The X-43 is the fastest jet-powered aircraft on record at approximately Mach 9.6.

A winged booster rocket with the X-43 placed on top, called a &quot;stack&quot;, was drop launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. After the booster rocket (a modified first stage of the Pegasus rocket) brought the stack to the target speed and altitude, it was discarded, and the X-43 flew free using its own engine, a scramjet.

The first plane in the series, the X-43A, was a single-use vehicle, of which three were built. The first X-43A was destroyed after malfunctioning in flight in 2001. Each of the other two flew successfully in 2004, setting speed records, with the scramjets operating for approximately 10 seconds followed by 10-minute glides and intentional crashes into the ocean. Plans for more planes in the X-43 series have been suspended or cancelled, and replaced by the USAF managed X-51 program.

==Development==
The X-43 was a part of NASA&#x27;s Hyper-X program, involving the American space agency and contractors such as Boeing, Micro Craft Inc, Orbital Sciences Corporation and General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL). Micro Craft Inc. built the X-43A and GASL built its engine.

One of the primary goals of NASA&#x27;s Aeronautics Enterprise was the development and demonstration of technologies for air-breathing hypersonic flight. Following the cancellation of the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program in November 1994, the United States lacked a cohesive hypersonic technology development program. As one of the &quot;better, faster, cheaper&quot; programs developed by NASA in the late 1990s, the Hyper-X used technology and research from the NASP program which advanced it toward the demonstration of hypersonic air breathing propulsion,

The Hyper-X Phase I was a NASA Aeronautics and Space Technology Enterprise program conducted jointly by the Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, and the Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California. Langley was the lead center and responsible for hypersonic technology development. Dryden was responsible for flight research.

Phase I was a seven-year, approximately $230,000,000 program to flight-validate scramjet propulsion, hypersonic aerodynamics and design methods.
Subsequent phases were not continued, as the X-43 series of aircraft was replaced in 2006 by the X-51.

==Design==

The X-43A aircraft was a small unpiloted test vehicle measuring just over in length. The vehicle was a lifting body design, where the body of the aircraft provides a significant amount of lift for flight, rather than relying on wings. The aircraft weighed roughly . The X-43A was designed to be fully controllable in high-speed flight, even when gliding without propulsion. However, the aircraft was not designed to land and be recovered. Test vehicles crashed into the Pacific Ocean when the test was over.

Traveling at Mach speeds produces significant heat due to the compression shock waves involved in supersonic aerodynamic drag. At high Mach speeds, heat can become so intense that metal portions of the airframe could melt. The X-43A compensated for this by cycling water behind the engine cowl and sidewall leading edges, cooling those surfaces. In tests, the water circulation was activated at about Mach 3.

===Engine===

The craft was created to develop and test a supersonic-combustion ramjet, or &quot;scramjet&quot; engine, an engine variation where external combustion takes place within air that is flowing at supersonic speeds. The X-43A&#x27;s developers designed the aircraft&#x27;s airframe to be part of the propulsion system: the forebody is a part of the intake airflow, while the aft section functions as an exhaust nozzle.

The engine of the X-43A was primarily fueled with hydrogen fuel. In the successful test, about of the fuel was used. For initial ignition, a mixture of hydrogen with 20% of monosilane, a pyrophoric gas, was used. Unlike rockets, scramjet-powered vehicles do not carry oxygen on board for fueling the engine. Removing the need to carry oxygen significantly reduces the vehicle&#x27;s size and weight. In the future, such lighter vehicles could take heavier payloads into space or carry payloads of the same weight much more efficiently.

Scramjets only operate at speeds in the range of Mach 4.5 or higher, so rockets or other jet engines are required to initially boost scramjet-powered aircraft to this base velocity. In the case of the X-43A, the aircraft was accelerated to high speed with a Pegasus rocket launched from a converted Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber. The combined X-43A and Pegasus vehicle was referred to as the &quot;stack&quot; by the program&#x27;s team members.

The engines in the X-43A test vehicles were specifically designed for a certain speed range, only able to compress and ignite the fuel-air mixture when the incoming airflow is moving as expected. The first two X-43A aircraft were intended for flight at approximately Mach 7, while the third was designed to operate at speeds greater than at altitudes of or more.

==Operational testing==

NASA&#x27;s first X-43A test on June 2, 2001 failed because the Pegasus booster lost control about 13 seconds after it was released from the B-52 carrier. The rocket experienced a control oscillation as it went transonic, eventually leading to the failure of the rocket&#x27;s starboard elevon. This caused the rocket to deviate significantly from the planned course, and it was destroyed as a safety precaution. An investigation into the incident stated that imprecise information about the capabilities of the rocket as well as its flight environment contributed to the accident. Several inaccuracies in data modeling for this test led to an inadequate control system for the particular Pegasus rocket used, though no single factor could ultimately be blamed for the failure.

In the second test in March 2004, the Pegasus fired successfully and released the test vehicle at an altitude of about . After separation, the engine&#x27;s air intake was opened, the engine ignited, and the aircraft then accelerated away from the rocket reaching . Fuel was flowing to the engine for 11 seconds, a time in which the aircraft traveled more than . Following Pegasus booster separation, the vehicle experienced a small drop in speed but the scramjet engine afterward accelerated the vehicle in climbing flight. After burnout, controllers were still able to maneuver the vehicle and manipulate the flight controls for several minutes; the aircraft, slowed by air resistance, fell into the ocean. With this flight the X-43A became the fastest free-flying air-breathing aircraft in the world.

NASA flew a third version of the X-43A on November 16, 2004. The Pegasus rocket booster separated from its B-52 carrier at 40,000 feet and its solid rocket took the combination to Mach 10 at 110,000 feet. The X-43A split away at Mach 9.8 and the engine was started at Mach 9.65 for 10–12 seconds with thrust approximately equal to drag, and then glided to the Pacific Ocean after 14 minutes. Dynamic pressure during the flight was . It reached Mach 9.68, at 109,440 ft (33,357 m), and further tested the ability of the vehicle to withstand the heat loads involved.

===Replacements===
In January 2006 the USAF announced the Force Application and Launch from Continental United States or FALCON scramjet reusable missile.
In March 2006, it was announced that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) supersonic combustion ramjet &quot;WaveRider&quot; flight test vehicle had been designated as X-51A. The USAF Boeing X-51 was first flown on May 26, 2010, dropped from a B-52.

==Variants==
After the X-43 tests in 2004, NASA Dryden engineers said that they expected all of their efforts to culminate in the production of a two-stage-to-orbit crewed vehicle in about 20 years. The scientists expressed much doubt that there would be a single-stage-to-orbit crewed vehicle like the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) in the foreseeable future.

Other X-43 vehicles were planned, but they have been suspended or canceled. They were expected to have the same basic body design as the X-43A, though the aircraft were expected to be moderately to significantly larger in size.

===X-43B===
The X-43B, was a full-size vehicle, incorporating a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine or a rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) ISTAR engine. Jet turbines or rockets would initially propel the vehicle to supersonic speed. A ramjet might take over starting at Mach 2.5, with the engine converting to a scramjet configuration at approximately Mach 5.

===X-43C===
The X-43C would have been somewhat larger than the X-43A and was expected to test the viability of hydrocarbon fuel, possibly with the HyTech engine. While most scramjet designs have used hydrogen for fuel, HyTech runs with conventional kerosene-type hydrocarbon fuels, which are more practical for support of operational vehicles. The building of a full-scale engine was planned which would use its own fuel for cooling. The engine cooling system would have acted as a chemical reactor by breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into short-chain hydrocarbons for a rapid burn.

The X-43C was indefinitely suspended in March 2004. The linked story reports the project&#x27;s indefinite suspension and the appearance of Rear Admiral Craig E. Steidle before a House Space and Aeronautics subcommittee hearing on March 18, 2004. In mid-2005, the X-43C appeared to be funded through the end of the year.

===X-43D===
The X-43D would have been almost identical to the X-43A, but expanded the speed envelope to Mach 15. As of September 2007, only a feasibility study had been conducted by Donald B. Johnson of Boeing and Jeffrey S. Robinson of NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center. According to the introduction of the study, &quot;The purpose of the X-43D is to gather high Mach flight environment and engine operability information which is difficult, if not impossible, to gather on the ground.&quot;

<doc id="558358" wikidata="Q3845778" url="?curid=558358" title="Marquess of Pembroke">
<text>Marquess of Pembroke was a title in the Peerage of England created by King Henry VIII for his future spouse Anne Boleyn.

==Background==

The then extinct title of Earl of Pembroke had been very significant for the House of Tudor. It was held by Henry VIII&#x27;s grand-uncle, Jasper Tudor, and it referred to the birthplace of King Henry VII. Henry VIII decided to raise his lover to the dignity of a marquess prior to finally marrying her. He chose to grant her the Marquessate of Pembroke.

==Creation==
On Sunday, 1 September 1532, Anne Boleyn was granted the Marquessate of Pembroke and land, mostly in Wales, worth over £1,000. The investiture ceremony was performed by Henry VIII himself in Windsor Castle. The ceremony was an elaborate affair, witnessed by the highest ranking peers and clergy in the kingdom, including Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Anne&#x27;s father and uncle respectively; Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk (Henry&#x27;s brother-in-law); Edward Lee, Archbishop of York; John Stokesley, Bishop of London; and Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester. The French ambassador was also present. The Bishop of Winchester read the patent of creation while Anne knelt before the King who then invested her with the coronet, the robe of estate and the charters of creation and of the lands.

The 16th-century spelling of her title was often &quot;marquesse&quot; or &quot;marquess&quot;, sometimes &quot;lady marquesse&quot;; a feminine, like duchess, of the relatively rare title &quot;marquys&quot;.

==Succession==
The marquessate was granted to Anne and her heirs male, but the patent did not include the usual provision that the said heirs male had to be of legitimate birth, thus enabling the title to pass to any illegitimate son Anne might have had. The attending peers did not fail to notice this unusual omission.

==End of the Marquessate==
It is not clear how the Marquessate of Pembroke ceased to exist. The latest it could have become extinct is upon Anne&#x27;s death, without male heirs, on 19 May 1536. However, it could have become extinct earlier, either:

*by merging with the Crown (i.e. became indistinct from other property of the Crown) on Anne&#x27;s marriage to the King being declared valid on 28 May 1533 (similar to the way titles held by the heir to the throne merge into the crown upon accession); or
*by forfeiture of the title upon Anne&#x27;s 15 May 1536 conviction for high treason.

The effect of the marriage of a peer to a reigning monarch is unclear. Likewise, although forfeiture of titles was a common form of punishment for peers at this time, the historical record is unclear.

<doc id="558359" wikidata="Q1924819" url="?curid=558359" title="Metaclass">
<text>In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes themselves. Unlike ordinary classes, which define the behaviors of objects, metaclasses specify the behaviors of classes and their instances. Not all object-oriented programming languages support the concept of metaclasses. For those that do, the extent of control metaclasses have over class behaviors varies. Metaclasses are often implemented by treating classes as first-class citizens, making a metaclass an object that creates and manages these classes. Each programming language adheres to its own metaobject protocol, which are the rules that determine interactions among objects, classes, and metaclasses. Metaclasses are utilized to automate code generation and to enhance framework development.

==Python example==
In Python, the builtin class codice_1 is a metaclass. Consider this simple Python class:
class Car:
 def __init__(self, make: str, model: str, year: int, color: str):
 self.make = make
 self.model = model
 self.year = year
 self.color = color

 @property
 def description(self) -&gt; str:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a description of this car.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 return f&quot;{self.color} {self.make} {self.model}&quot;
At run time, codice_2 itself is an instance of codice_1. The source code of the codice_2 class, shown above, does not include such details as the size in bytes of codice_2 objects, their binary layout in memory, how they are allocated, that the codice_6 method is automatically called each time a codice_2 is created, and so on. These details come into play not only when a new codice_2 object is created, but also each time any attribute of a codice_2 is accessed. In languages without metaclasses, these details are defined by the language specification and can&#x27;t be overridden. In Python, the metaclass - codice_1 - controls these details of codice_2&#x27;s behavior. They can be overridden by using a different metaclass instead of codice_1.

The above example contains some redundant code to do with the four attributes codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, and codice_16. It is possible to eliminate some of this redundancy using a custom metaclass. In Python, a metaclass is most easily defined as a subclass of codice_1.

class AttributeInitType(type):
 def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Create a new instance.&quot;&quot;&quot;

 # First, create the object in the normal default way.
 obj = type.__call__(self, *args)

 # Additionally, set attributes on the new object.
 for name, value in kwargs.items():
 setattr(obj, name, value)

 # Return the new object.
 return obj

This metaclass only overrides object creation. All other aspects of class and object behavior are still handled by codice_1.

Now the class codice_2 can be rewritten to use this metaclass. In Python 3 this is done by providing a &quot;keyword argument&quot; codice_20 to the class definition:

class Car(object, metaclass=AttributeInitType):
 @property
 def description(self) -&gt; str:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a description of this car.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 return &quot; &quot;.join(str(value) for value in self.__dict__.values())
The resulting object codice_2 can be instantiated as usual, but can contain any number of keyword arguments:

new_car = Car(make=&#x27;Toyota&#x27;, model=&#x27;Prius&#x27;, year=2005, color=&#x27;Green&#x27;, engine=&#x27;Hybrid&#x27;)
==In Smalltalk-80==


In Smalltalk, everything is an object. Additionally, Smalltalk is a class based system, which means that every object has a class that defines the structure of that object (i.e. the instance variables the object has) and the messages an object understands. Together this implies that a class in Smalltalk is an object and that, therefore a class needs to be an instance of a class (called metaclass).

As an example, a car object codice_22 is an instance of the class codice_2. In turn, the class codice_2 is again an object and as such an instance of the metaclass of codice_2 called codice_26. Note the blank in the name of the metaclass. The name of the metaclass is the Smalltalk expression that, when evaluated, results in the metaclass object. Thus evaluating codice_26 results in the metaclass object for codice_2 whose name is codice_26 (one can confirm this by evaluating codice_30 which returns the name of the metaclass of codice_2.)

Class methods actually belong to the metaclass, just as instance methods actually belong to the class. When a message is sent to the object codice_32, the search for the method starts in codice_33. If it is not found it proceeds up the superclass chain, stopping at Object whether it is found or not.

When a message is sent to codice_33 the search for the method starts in codice_35 and proceeds up the superclass chain to codice_36. Note that, so far, the metaclass inheritance chain exactly follows that of the class inheritance chain. But the metaclass chain extends further because codice_36 is the subclass of codice_38. All metaclasses are subclasses of Class.

In early Smalltalks, there was only one metaclass called codice_38. This implied that the methods all classes have were the same, in particular the method to create new objects, i.e., codice_40. To allow classes to have their own methods and their own instance variables (called class instance variables and should not be confused with class variables), Smalltalk-80 introduced for each class codice_41 their own metaclass codice_42. This means that each metaclass is effectively a singleton class.

Since there is no requirement that metaclasses behave differently from each other, all metaclasses are instances of only one class called codice_43. The metaclass of codice_43 is called codice_45 which again is an instance of class codice_43.

In Smalltalk-80, every class (except codice_47) has a superclass. The abstract superclass of all metaclasses is codice_38, which describes the general nature of classes.

The superclass hierarchy for metaclasses parallels that for classes, except for class codice_47. ALL metaclasses are subclasses of codice_38, therefore: 
* codice_51
Like conjoined twins, classes and metaclasses are born together. codice_43 has an instance variable codice_53, which points to its conjoined class.
Note that the usual Smalltalk class browser does not show metaclasses as separate classes. Instead the class browser allows to edit the class together with its metaclass at the same time.

The names of classes in the metaclass hierarchy are easily confused with the concepts of the same name. For instance:
* codice_47 is the base class that provides common methods for all objects; &quot;an object&quot; is an integer, or a widget, or a codice_2, etc.
* codice_38 is the base of the metaclasses that provides common methods for all classes (though it is not a metaclass itself); &quot;a class&quot; is something like codice_33, or codice_58, or codice_2, etc.
* codice_43 provides common methods for all metaclasses.

Four classes provide the facilities to describe new classes. Their inheritance hierarchy (from Object), and the main facilities they provide are:

:Object - default behavior common to all objects, like class access
::Behavior - minimum state for compiling methods and creating/running objects
:::ClassDescription (abstract class) - class/variable naming, comments
::::Class - similar, more comprehensive, facilities to superclasses
::::Metaclass - initializing class variables, instance creation messages

==In Ruby==
Ruby purifies the Smalltalk-80 concept of metaclasses by introducing ,
removing the codice_43 class,
and (un)redefining the class-of map.

The change can be schematized as follows:

Note in particular the correspondence between Smalltalk&#x27;s implicit metaclasses and Ruby&#x27;s eigenclasses of classes.
The Ruby eigenclass model makes the concept of implicit metaclasses fully uniform: every object &quot;x&quot; has its own meta-object, called the &quot;eigenclass&quot; of &quot;x&quot;, which is one meta-level higher than &quot;x&quot;. The &quot;higher order&quot; eigenclasses usually exist purely conceptually – they do not contain any methods or store any (other) data in most Ruby programs.

The following diagrams show a sample core structure of Smalltalk-80 and Ruby in comparison.
In both languages, the structure consists of a built-in part which contains the circular objects (i.e. objects that appear in a cycle formed by a combination of blue or green links) and a user-part which has four explicit objects: classes codice_62 and codice_63
and terminal objects codice_64 and codice_65.
Green links show the child→parent relation of inheritance (with the implicit upward direction), blue links show the complementary member→container relation of instantiation (a blue link from &quot;x&quot; points to the least actual container of &quot;x&quot; that is the start point for the method lookup when a method is invoked on &quot;x&quot;). Gray nodes display the eigenclasses (resp. implicit metaclasses in the case of Smalltalk-80).


The diagram on the right also provides a picture of lazy evaluation of eigenclasses in Ruby. The codice_65 object can have its eigenclass evaluated (allocated) as a consequence of adding &quot;singleton methods&quot; to codice_65.

According to the Ruby&#x27;s introspection method named codice_68,
the class of every class (and of every eigenclass) is
constantly the codice_38 class (denoted by codice_22 in the diagram).
codice_38, and codice_72 are the only classes that have classes as instances. Subclassing of codice_38 is disallowed.

Following the standard definition of metaclasses we can conclude that codice_38 and codice_72 are the only metaclasses in Ruby.
This seems to contradict the correspondence between Ruby and Smalltalk,
since in Smalltalk-80, every class has its own metaclass.
The discrepancy is based on the disagreement between
the codice_68 introspection method in Ruby and Smalltalk. While the map &quot;x ↦ x.&quot;codice_68 coincides on terminal objects, it differs in the restriction to classes. As already mentioned above, for a class codice_78, the Ruby expression codice_79 evaluates constantly to codice_38. In Smalltalk-80, if codice_78 is a class then the expression codice_82 corresponds
to the Ruby&#x27;s codice_83
– which evaluates to the eigenclass of codice_78.

== In Objective-C ==


Metaclasses in Objective-C are almost the same as those in Smalltalk-80—not surprising since Objective-C borrows a lot from Smalltalk. Like Smalltalk, in Objective-C, the instance variables and methods are defined by an object&#x27;s class. A class is an object, hence it is an instance of a metaclass.

Like Smalltalk, in Objective-C, class methods are simply methods called on the class object, hence a class&#x27;s class methods must be defined as instance methods in its metaclass. Because different classes can have different sets of class methods, each class must have its own separate metaclass. Classes and metaclasses are always created as a pair: the runtime has functions codice_85 and codice_86 to create and register class-metaclass pairs, respectively.

There are no names for the metaclasses; however, a pointer to any class object can be referred to with the generic type codice_38 (similar to the type codice_88 being used for a pointer to any object).

Because class methods are inherited through inheritance, like Smalltalk, metaclasses must follow an inheritance scheme paralleling that of classes (e.g. if class A&#x27;s parent class is class B, then A&#x27;s metaclass&#x27;s parent class is B&#x27;s metaclass), except that of the root class.

Unlike Smalltalk, the metaclass of the root class inherits from the root class (usually codice_89 using the Cocoa framework) itself. This ensures that all class objects are ultimately instances of the root class, so that you can use the instance methods of the root class, usually useful utility methods for objects, on class objects themselves.

Since metaclass objects do not behave differently (you cannot add class methods for a metaclass, so metaclass objects all have the same methods), they are all instances of the same class—the metaclass of the root class (unlike Smalltalk). Thus, the metaclass of the root class is an instance of itself. The reason for this is that all metaclasses inherit from root class; hence, they must inherit the class methods of the root class.

==Support in languages and tools==
The following are some of the most prominent programming languages that support metaclasses.
* Common Lisp, via CLOS
* Delphi and other versions of Object Pascal influenced by it
* Groovy
* Objective-C
* ooRexx
* Python
* Perl, via the metaclass pragma, as well as Moose
* Ruby
* Smalltalk
* C++ (proposed for a possible inclusion in future version of the standard)
Some less widespread languages that support metaclasses include OpenJava, OpenC++, OpenAda, CorbaScript, ObjVLisp, Object-Z, MODEL-K, XOTcl, and MELDC. Several of these languages date from the early 1990s and are of academic interest.

Logtalk, an object-oriented extension of Prolog, also supports metaclasses.

Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) both support metaclasses.

<text>Władysław Raczkiewicz (; 28 January 1885 – 6 June 1947) was a Polish politician, lawyer, diplomat and President of Poland-in-exile from 1939 until his death in 1947. Until 1945, he was the internationally recognized Polish head of state, and the Polish government-in-exile was recognized as the continuation of the Polish government of 1939.

==Early life and studies==
Władysław Raczkiewicz was born in Kutaisi, the second-largest city in Georgia, at that time part of the Russian Empire to Polish parents Józef Raczkiewicz, a court judge, and Ludwika Łukaszewicz. He studied in Saint Petersburg where he joined the Polish Youth Organization. After graduating from the Faculty of Law at the University of Dorpat he was employed as a lawyer in Minsk. 

Upon the outbreak of World War I he served in the Russian Imperial Army, but after the Russian Revolution he joined the vanguard for Polish independence. He was active in the Union of Military Poles in Russia. Serving as the head of the , he helped create the Polish I Corps in Russia. Later he served under future Marshal and chief-of-state Józef Piłsudski, who created the Polish Legions that ultimately aided Poland in re-establishing its independence.

As a volunteer, he fought in the Polish–Soviet War between 1919 and 1920. At first, he supported the Endecja faction, later joined the Piłsudski-led Sanation camp. Raczkiewicz served as the Voivode of the Nowogródek Voivodeship from 1921 to 1924; government delegate to Wilno Land (1924–1925) and later as the voivodeship&#x27;s voivode (1926–1931). After the 1930 Polish parliamentary election, he was appointed the Senate Marshal (1930–1935) and Voivode of Kraków Voivodeship in 1935, and Pomeranian Voivodeship from 1936 to 1939.

==World War II==
When Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1939, he escaped to Angers, France, where the Polish government-in-exile was established. He lived in the nearby Château de Pignerolle from 2 December 1939 until moving on 10 June 1940 to London, where he joined General Władysław Sikorski and Stanisław Mikołajczyk in the relocated Polish government-in-exile. He was an opponent of the Sikorski–Mayski agreement.

In February 1945, Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt held the Yalta Conference. The future of Poland was one of the main topics that were deliberated upon. Stalin claimed that only a strong, pro-Soviet government in Poland would be able to guarantee the security of the Soviet Union. As a result of the conference, the Allies agreed to withdraw their recognition of the Polish government-in-exile, after the formation of a new government on Polish territory.

Raczkiewicz died in exile in 1947, in the Welsh town of Ruthin. He was buried in the cemetery at Newark-on-Trent in England. In November 2022, the remains of Raczkiewicz, August Zaleski, and Stanisław Ostrowski were reburied at the Mausoleum for emigree presidents at the Temple of Divine Providence in Warsaw.

<text>Tourism in New Zealand comprised an important sector of the national economy – tourism directly contributed NZ$16.2 billion (or 5.8%) of the country&#x27;s GDP in the year ended March 2019. tourism supported 188,000 full-time-equivalent jobs (nearly 7.5% of New Zealand&#x27;s workforce). The flow-on effects of tourism indirectly contributed a further 4.3% of GDP (or NZ$9.8 billion). Despite the country&#x27;s geographical isolation, spending by international tourists accounted for 17.1% of New Zealand&#x27;s export earnings (nearly NZ$12 billion). International and domestic tourism contributed, in total, NZ$34 billion to New Zealand&#x27;s economy every year .

New Zealand markets itself abroad as a &quot;clean, green&quot; adventure-playground (Tourism New Zealand&#x27;s main marketing slogan, &quot;100% Pure New Zealand&quot;, reflects this), emphasising as typical tourist destinations nature areas such as Milford Sound, Abel Tasman National Park and the Tongariro Alpine Crossing; while activities such as bungee jumping or whale watching exemplify typical tourist attractions, marketed primarily to individual and small-group travellers. Australia provides by far the largest group of New Zealand&#x27;s international tourists (about 45%), due to its close proximity (three to four hours by plane) and traditional good relations. Mainland China, the United States and the United Kingdom are the next three largest markets.

The vast majority of international tourist arrivals to New Zealand come through Auckland Airport, which handled 11.5 million international passengers . Two per cent of visitors arrived by sea . Many international tourists spend time in Auckland, Christchurch, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wellington. Other high-profile destinations include the Bay of Islands, the Waitomo Caves, Aoraki / Mount Cook, and Milford Sound. Many tourists travel considerable distances through the country during their stays, typically using coach lines or hired cars. Though some destinations have seasonal specialities (for winter sports, for example), New Zealand&#x27;s southern-hemisphere location offers attractions for off-peak northern-hemisphere tourists chasing or avoiding certain seasons. In June 2018 the New Zealand government announced the imposition of a &quot;tourist tax&quot; of around NZ$25 to NZ$35 for international visitors, excluding Australians, many Pacific islanders, and young children. It planned to implement this taxation in 2019 through a newly proposed electronic travel-registration process.

== International travel ==
=== Overview ===

The country is internationally seen as a top holiday destination, as shown by being voted most favourite destination by the readers of the &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; magazine (specialising in luxury travel) in 2008, though it slipped to second place in 2009. A 2007 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; poll, the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest such poll, also identified New Zealand as the best overseas holiday destination. Between 2000 (the start of an advertising campaign by Tourism New Zealand) and 2007 the number of Britons visiting New Zealand increased by 61%. In November 2012 readers of the UK newspaper &quot;The Telegraph&quot; voted New Zealand the best country in the world to go to on holiday.

The availability of air travel is a large contributing factor to market growth. After Air New Zealand launched non-stop flights from Auckland to Buenos Aires in December 2015, visitor numbers from Argentina tripled, from 5,400 in 2015 to 15,300 in 2016.

Tourism New Zealand, the country&#x27;s official tourism agency, actively promotes the country as a destination worldwide. Activities have included a NZ$7 million campaign in China, concentrating on Shanghai, and co-operating to produce a New Zealand tourism layer for Google Earth, the first such country-wide initiative.

Visitors from 60 countries require a New Zealand eTA (NZ eTA) from 1 October 2019.

From March 2020, New Zealand government implemented strict quarantine provisions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic across the nationwide, and the numbers of incoming international visitors dropped dramatically. The tourism sector responded with a strategy of hunker and hope.
A brief reopening of borders with Australia (&quot;Travel bubble&quot;) from April 2021 encountered official &quot;pauses&quot; and &quot;suspension&quot; (July 2021) as COVID-19 Deltacron hybrid variant took hold in different Australian states. In September 2024, New Zealand announced to increase its International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy from NZ$35 to NZ$100 starting on 1 October 2024, to boost economic growth and ensure tourists contribute to public services. While the government believed this wouldn&#x27;t significantly deter visitors, Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA) warned that the higher fee might discourage tourism, especially as the country struggled to recover to pre-pandemic visitor numbers. The tax hike was not applied to tourists from Australia and the Pacific, and additional visa fees would also rise.

=== Environmental impacts ===
Public concern over the environmental impacts of air travel may threaten tourism growth in New Zealand, as almost all tourists fly long distances to reach New Zealand. However, Ministry of Tourism data in 2007 predicted a four per cent annual growth in tourist numbers in New Zealand, with 3.2 million tourists annually to be reached in 2014. However, it remains unclear how New Zealand&#x27;s carbon-neutral policy will affect future tourism – with some researchers arguing that the carbon emissions of tourism are much higher than generally considered, that their offsetting or mitigation will be very difficult, and that this poses a serious threat to the country&#x27;s major source of foreign income.

== Domestic travel ==

Periodic campaigns are also directed at New Zealanders, urging them to travel within New Zealand instead of overseas, due to a perception by the tourism industry that too many New Zealanders are travelling to Australia or other countries instead of domestically. Perhaps the best-known slogan is &quot;Don&#x27;t leave town until you&#x27;ve seen the country&quot;.

Air travel is a popular way of getting around the country due to the lack of transport alternatives over longer distances (for example, going from Auckland to Napier, a 400 km journey takes an hour by plane compared to nearly five hours by car or seven hours by bus.

Passenger trains are limited to Auckland-Wellington, Picton-Christchurch and Christchurch-Greymouth, scenic daytrip journeys which often cost more than an airfare. Outside of trunk routes connecting main cities (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown), airfares can, due to a lack of competition, cost nearly as much as trips to Australia.

Domestic tourism spending still exceeds that of international tourism; in the year to March 2020, domestic tourists spent $24.4 billion compared to $17.5 billion spent by international tourists. However, the economy suffered from COVID-19 pandemic, when the borders were closed to the international tourists and other visitors from 2020 to 2022, and the tourism sector is expected to take years to recover.

== Tourist activities ==
Popular tourist activities in New Zealand include sightseeing, adventure tourism, tramping (hiking) and camping. To support active travel, New Zealand has numerous walking and hiking paths (often created and maintained by the DOC), some of which, like the Milford Track, have huge international recognition. There is also a walking route the length of the country (Te Araroa) and the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

== Statistics ==

=== International markets ===
The top countries for international visitor arrivals to New Zealand in terms of their nationality are as follows.
Australia accounted for 42.5 per cent of New Zealand visitor arrivals in 2023. Broken down by state, New South Wales accounted for 396,789 visitors, followed by Queensland with 318,803 visitors, and Victoria with 282,303 visitors.

Of the top 14 nationalities, all except India, China, and Fiji are entitled to visa waivers, while all except the United Kingdom, India, Germany, and the Philippines have non-stop flights to New Zealand.

<text>Nicolae Rădescu (; 30 March 1874 – 16 May 1953) was a Romanian army officer and political figure. He was the last pre-communist rule Prime Minister of Romania, serving from 7 December 1944 to 1 March 1945.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
The son of small landowners (Radu and Zamfira), Rădescu was born on 30 March 1874 in Călimănești, Vâlcea County. He attended the Military School for Officers, graduating on 1 July 1898 with the rank of second lieutenant. He pursued his military studies at the Cavalry School, graduating in June 1900 and being promoted to lieutenant in 1903, and then at the Higher War School in Bucharest (1904–1905), being promoted to captain on 4 October 1909.

===Second Balkan War and World War I===
In the summer of 1913 he saw action with the 1st Cavalry Division in the military campaign in Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War. He was promoted to major on 1 April 1916, and served in World War I during the Romanian Campaign of 1916 with the 5th Regiment &quot;Călărași&quot;, fighting against the German forces at the Carpathian mountain passes. For his bravery and skill at the Battle of Sălătrucu, in the Topolog Valley, he was awarded on 10 January 1917 the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd Class. In April 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel; he served as Chief of Staff for the 2nd Cavalry Division until 1 September 1918, and was promoted to colonel in April 1919.

===The Interwar period===
On 27 May 1920 Rădescu was appointed adjutant of King Ferdinand, after which he served as military attaché in London (1926–1928). Upon his return, he was promoted in March 1928 to brigadier general. He served as commanding officer of the 4th Brigade &quot;Roșiori&quot;, after which he was attached to the Inspectorate-General of Cavalry, and then commanded the 1st Cavalry Division (1931–1933). He resigned from the Army on 5 February 1933 and transferred to the retired reserves. Upon presenting his resignation, he accused &quot;profiteering politicians&quot; and King Carol II&#x27;s camarilla of commercializing military life.

That same month Rădescu joined the People&#x27;s Party of Marshal Alexandru Averescu. In the mid-1930s, he became involved in nationalist politics; he supported a far right movement called &quot;Cruciada Românismului&quot; (&quot;The Crusade of Romanianism&quot;), aimed at the cultural &quot;Romanization&quot; of Germans and Hungarians in Transylvania. This short-lived movement was a splinter group of the Iron Guard, created by Mihai Stelescu. After Stelescu was assassinated in July 1936 by an Iron Guard death squad, Rădescu became a leader of the movement, which quickly faded afterwards. Because of his political stances and his opinions regarding the royal camarilla, he started being monitored by the secret police (&quot;Siguranța Statului&quot;).

===World War II and the rise of Communism===

After King Carol II abdicated in September 1940, Rădescu charged dictator Ion Antonescu with collaborating with the Nazis. As noted by ex-President Emil Constantinescu at a memorial ceremony, Rădescu opposed the advance of Romanian troops beyond the Dniester River after Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina had been recaptured in 1941 from the Soviet Union. In 1942, Rădescu wrote an article critical of the German ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger and his constant intrusion in the internal affairs of Romania. He was interned as a political prisoner in the Târgu Jiu camp. On 23 August 1944, immediately after Antonescu&#x27;s downfall in King Michael&#x27;s Coup, Rădescu was released from prison. On 15 October he was appointed Chief of the Romanian General Staff at the insistence of the Soviet government, which favored him for his independence and his reputation as an ardent anti-fascist who was respected by the people.

He became prime minister on 7 December 1944. The Soviet government initially supported him; on a visit to Bucharest, the Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrey Vyshinsky, publicly expressed Soviet confidence in the Rădescu government. Soon after the situation changed, as conflicts over the armistice agreement emerged, especially over Moscow&#x27;s demand for $300 million in reparations; Rădescu also resisted the Soviet order to deport Germans from Romania to the Soviet Union. To assist with the imposition of a communist government, the Soviet NKGB and the Romanian communists supported the &quot;Patriotic Defense Guards&quot;; these paramilitary organizations, which appeared after August 1944, were placed under the command of Emil Bodnăraș. On 15 January 1945, Rădescu ordered the dissolution of the Guards, but Teohari Georgescu and Bodnăraș ignored the instructions. At the same time, Deputy Prime Minister Petru Groza, anticipating the imminent agrarian reform, encouraged the peasants to forcibly take the land of the big landlords.

On 24 February 1945, the Communist Party of Romania and its allies organized a mass rally in front of the Royal Palace to call for his resignation. As the protest carried on, communist agents opened fire from the Interior Ministry building situated across the street, killing several people. In a radio address later that day, Rădescu blamed the attack on Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca, calling them &quot;hyenas&quot; and &quot;strangers without kin or God&quot;. The next day, the Communist Party orchestrated an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Rădescu. His son, Nicu, who had participated at the rally (he had been recruited into the Party in 1940), wrote an open letter to his father; the letter, published in Scînteia and România Liberă on 28 February, accused Rădescu of issuing the order to shoot peaceful demonstrators. Radio Moscow called Rădescu the &quot;Butcher of Palace Square&quot;. Concomitantly, Vyshinsky arrived in Bucharest and demanded from King Michael the resignation of Rădescu; at the direction of Joseph Stalin, he warned that the Soviet Union would not allow Northern Transylvania to be returned to Romania if Rădescu were to remain prime minister. As a result of all these pressures, Rădescu resigned his position on 1 March.

On 6 March 1945, the first Communist-dominated government of Romania took office under the direction of Petru Groza. Over the next few years, the Communists completely consolidated their power.

===Exile in the West===
One of the first decrees of the Groza government (issued on 7 March 1945) was to impose mandatory domicile for General Rădescu. Pursued by the Communist authorities, Rădescu sought refuge in the British legation, stayed there for about two months, and was then handed over to Romanian authorities, who had guaranteed his safety but placed him under house arrest. His personal secretary, Adriana Georgescu-Cosmovici, was arrested and was subjected to rape and torture at Malmaison Prison in Bucharest. On 17 June 1946, he managed to flee on board a plane to the British Crown colony of Cyprus, where he was detained in a refugee camp by the authorities until the Paris Peace Treaties were signed in 1947. Via Lisbon and Paris he ended up in the United States. Once in America, he and other exiled Romanian political figures, including , Mihail Fărcășanu, Grigore Gafencu, and Constantin Vișoianu, came together to form a united anti-communist opposition in exile called the Romanian National Committee. In 1950, after disagreements within the committee, he was one of the founders of the &quot;Liga Românilor Liberi&quot; (&quot;The League of Free Romanians&quot;), together with Grigore Gafencu, Nicolae Caranfil, Mihail Fărcășanu, Carol &quot;Citta&quot; Davila, Viorel Tilea, general , and Vintilă Brătianu.

Rădescu died of tuberculosis on 16 May 1953 in New York City; he was buried in the city&#x27;s Calvary Cemetery. At the initiative of Prime Minister Mugur Isărescu, the remains of General Rădescu were brought back to Romania in 2000. Following the wishes expressed in his testament, he was reburied at the Orthodox Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest on 23 November 2000.

<doc id="558373" wikidata="Q2423283" url="?curid=558373" title="Mantell UFO incident">
<text>On 7 January 1948, 25-year-old Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a Kentucky Air National Guard pilot, died when he crashed his P-51 Mustang fighter plane near Franklin, Kentucky, United States, after being sent in pursuit of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Mantell pursued the object in a steep climb and disregarded suggestions to level his altitude. At high altitude, he blacked out from a lack of oxygen; his plane went into a downward spiral and crashed. The incident was among the most publicized of early UFO reports. Later investigation by the United States Air Force&#x27;s Project Blue Book indicated that Mantell died chasing a Skyhook balloon, which, in 1948, was a top-secret project that he would not have known about.

==Incident==

On 7 January 1948, Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox, Kentucky, received a report from the Kentucky Highway Patrol of an unusual aerial object near Madisonville which could not be immediately identified. Four F-51D Mustangs of C Flight, 165th Fighter Squadron Kentucky Air National Guard, one piloted by Captain Thomas F. Mantell, were told to approach the object. Mantell climbed to 15,000 feet. According to former U.S. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, no one could recall Mantell&#x27;s description of the object, but &quot;saucer historians have credited him with saying&quot; that the object was &quot;metallic and of tremendous size&quot;. Mantell continued to climb to 22,000 feet, but his wingmen did not follow due to lack of sufficient oxygen equipment and tried to contact him to request he discontinue his ascent. Since Mantell&#x27;s aircraft also lacked the requisite oxygen equipment for high-altitude flight, the Army later determined that once Mantell passed he blacked out from lack of oxygen and his plane began spiraling back towards the ground. Witnesses reported Mantell&#x27;s Mustang in a circling descent. His plane crashed on a farm south of Franklin, on Kentucky&#x27;s border with Tennessee.

==Press coverage and rumors==
The Mantell incident was reported by newspapers around the nation, and received significant press attention. A number of sensational rumors were also circulated about the crash. According to UFO historian Curtis Peebles, among the rumors were claims that &quot;the flying saucer was a Soviet missile; it was [an alien] spacecraft that shot down [Mantell&#x27;s fighter] when it got too close; Captain Mantell&#x27;s body was found riddled with bullets; the body was missing; the plane had completely disintegrated in the air; [and] the wreckage was radioactive.&quot; However, no evidence has ever surfaced to substantiate any of these claims, and Air Force investigation specifically refuted some claims, such as the supposedly radioactive wreckage.

Sensational media featured a variety of unsubstantiated rumors including Mantell describing the object as &quot;metallic&quot;, Mantell being wounded by a mysterious &quot;ray&quot;, his body being missing from the wreckage, and unexplained tiny holes found in his wrecked aircraft; Kehoe and Ruppelt dismissed these rumors.

==Explanations==

Venus had been in the same place in the sky that Mantell&#x27;s UFO was observed, and the crash was initially thought to have been caused by the pilot mistaking the planet for an unidentified object, a conclusion reached by Project Blue Book investigator J. Allen Hynek in 1948. Hynek later retracted the Venus explanation, concluding it was incorrect because &quot;Venus wasn&#x27;t bright enough to be seen&quot; by Mantell and the other witnesses, and because a considerable haze was present that would have further obscured the planet in the sky.

In 1952, Project Blue Book identified the object Mantell pursued as a Skyhook balloon, a top-secret project that he would not have known about at the time. The massive spy balloons rose to 100,000 feet in the air. The Army determined that Mantell lost consciousness pursuing one into the atmosphere without oxygen. Classified and likely released by another branch of the armed services, the large craft would have been unknown to Mantell or the observers on the ground. A report from Madisonville, Kentucky, identified the object as a balloon after viewing it through a telescope. Dr. Seyfert, an astronomer at Vanderbilt University, observed the object through binoculars drifting south of Nashville, Tennessee. He described it as &quot;a pear-shaped balloon with cables and a basket attached.&quot;

While UFOs are culturally associated with the mysterious, they are often later identified, particularly as balloons. Skyhook sightings were behind many UFO reports during the 1940s and 1950s. The more famous Roswell Incident and 2023 high-altitude sightings were also later attributed to military balloon projects.

==Thomas Mantell biography==
Captain Thomas Francis Mantell Jr. (30 June 1922 – 7 January 1948) was a United States Air Force officer and a World War II veteran. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for courageous action during D-Day, and an Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters for aerial achievement.

===Career===
Mantell graduated from Male High School in Louisville. On 16 June 1942, he joined the United States Army Air Corps, the preceding organization to the Air Force, finishing Flight School on 30 June 1943. During World War II, he was a C-47 Skytrain pilot assigned to the 96th Troop Carrier Squadron, 440th Troop Carrier Group, which air dropped the 101st Airborne Division into Normandy on 6 June 1944.

Mantell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism while piloting a C-47 named &quot;Vulture&#x27;s Delight&quot; and towing a glider under heavy anti-aircraft fire.

After the war, Mantell returned to Louisville and joined the newly formed Kentucky Air National Guard on 16 February 1947, becoming a F-51D Mustang pilot in the 165th Fighter Squadron.

Following his death in January 1948, Mantell&#x27;s remains were sent to Louisville for burial in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery.
He was survived by his wife Peggy and their sons, Thomas and Terry Mantell.
On 29 September 2001, the Simpson County Historical Society unveiled a historical marker in honor of Mantell in his hometown of Franklin. The marker is located at the exit off Interstate 65.

<text>Steve Grand OBE (born 12 February 1958) is a British computer scientist and roboticist. He was the creator and lead programmer of the &quot;Creatures&quot; artificial life simulation, which he discussed in his first book &quot;Creation: Life and How to Make It&quot;, a finalist for the 2001 Aventis Prize for Science Books. He is also an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, which he received in 2000.

Grand&#x27;s project from 2001 to 2006 was the building of an artificial robot baby orangutan, with the intention of having it learn as a human baby would. This is documented in his book &quot;Growing up with Lucy&quot;.

==Projects==
;&quot;Creatures&quot;
One of the best known projects created by Steve Grand is &quot;Creatures&quot;, an artificial life simulation, which his company Cyberlife Technology released in the 1996. It was the first in a series of games.

;Lucy, the Android
His project from 2001 to 2005 was Lucy, a mechanical baby orangutan. Lucy was an attempt at simulating the mind of a human baby.

;&quot;Sim-biosis&quot;
Grand worked on &quot;Sim-biosis&quot;, a computer simulation game in which complete artificial creatures could be built from functional, structural units. It is available on SourceForge under the name &quot;Simergy&quot;.

;Grandroids
In February 2011, Grand announced a new project, Grandroids, described as &quot;real &#x27;alien&#x27; life forms who can live in a virtual world on your computer&quot;. In September 2024, the project was renamed to Phantasia, and the progress updates were made public.

<text>The dirham, dirhem or drahm is a unit of currency and of mass. It is the name of the currencies of Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Armenia, and is the name of a currency subdivision in Jordan, Libya, Qatar and Tajikistan. It was historically a silver coin.

==Unit of mass==
The dirham was a unit of mass used across North Africa, the Middle East, Persia and Ifat; later known as Adal, with varying values.

The value of Islamic dirham was 14 qirat. 10 dirham equals 7 mithqal (2.975 gm of silver).

In the late Ottoman Empire (), the standard dirham was 3.207 g; 400 dirhem equal one oka. The Ottoman dirham was based on the Sasanian drachm (in Middle Persian: 𐭦𐭥𐭦𐭭 &quot;drahm&quot;), which was itself based on the Greek dram/drachma.

In Egypt in 1895, it was equivalent to 47.661 troy grains (3.088 g).

There is currently a movement within the Islamic world to revive the dirham as a unit of mass for measuring silver, although the exact value is disputed (either 3 or 2.975 grams).

==History==

The word &quot;dirham&quot; ultimately comes from &quot;drachma&quot; (δραχμή), the Greek coin. The Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire lay partially in the Levant and traded with Arabia, circulating the coin there in pre-Islamic times and afterward. It was this currency which was initially adopted as a Persian word (Middle Persian &quot;drahm&quot; or &quot;dram&quot;); then near the end of the 7th century the coin became an Islamic currency bearing the name of the sovereign and a religious verse. The Arabs introduced their own coins.

The Islamic dirham was 8 daniq. The dirham was struck in many Mediterranean countries, including Al-Andalus (Moorish Spain) and the Byzantine Empire (&quot;miliaresion&quot;), and could be used as currency in Europe between the 10th and 12th centuries, notably in areas with Viking connections, such as Viking York and Dublin.

===Dirham in Jewish orthodox law===
The &quot;dirham&quot; is frequently mentioned in Jewish orthodox law as a unit of weight used to measure various requirements in religious functions, such as the weight in silver specie pledged in Marriage Contracts (&quot;Ketubbah&quot;), the quantity of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion, etc. Jewish physician and philosopher, Maimonides, uses the Egyptian &quot;dirham&quot; to approximate the quantity of flour for dough-portion, writing in Mishnah &quot;Eduyot&quot; 1:2: &quot;And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty &quot;dirhams&quot; of wheat flour, while all these dirhams are the Egyptian [&quot;dirham&quot;].&quot; This view is repeated by Maran&#x27;s &quot;Shulhan Arukh&quot; (&quot;Hil. Hallah&quot;, Yoreh Deah § 324:3) in the name of the Tur. In Maimonides&#x27; commentary of the Mishnah (&quot;Eduyot&quot; 1:2, note 18), Rabbi Yosef Qafih explains that the weight of each Egyptian &quot;dirham&quot; was approximately 3.333 grams, or what was the equivalent to 16 carob-grains which, when taken together, the minimum weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to approx. 1 kilo and 733 grams. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, in his &quot;Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam&quot; (vol. 1, pp. 288–291), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian &quot;dirham&quot;, saying that it weighed approx. 3.0 grams, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest&#x27;s portion is 1 kilo and 560 grams. Others (e.g. Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh) say the Egyptian &quot;dirham&quot; weighed approx. 3.205 grams, which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 grams. Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of Bnei Barak) wrote that the traditional weight used in Yemen for each &quot;dirham&quot; weighed 3.20 grams for a total of 31.5 &quot;dirhams&quot; given as the redemption of one&#x27;s firstborn son (&quot;pidyon haben&quot;), or 3.36 grams for the 30 &quot;dirhams&quot; required by the Shulhan Arukh (&quot;Yoreh De&#x27;ah&quot; 305:1), and which in relation to the separation of the dough-portion made for a total weight of 1 kilo and 770.72 grams.

The word &quot;drachmon&quot; (), used in some translations of Maimonides&#x27; commentary of the Mishnah, has in all places the same connotation as &quot;dirham&quot;.

== Modern-day currency ==
Currently the valid national currencies with the name &quot;dirham&quot; are:

Modern currencies with the subdivision &quot;dirham&quot; or &quot;diram&quot; are:
The unofficial modern gold dinar, issued and/or proposed by several states and proto-states, is also divided into dirhams.

<doc id="558387" wikidata="Q5212581" url="?curid=558387" title="Viscount Grandison">
<text>Viscount Grandison, of Limerick, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1620 for Sir Oliver St John, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. He was the descendant and namesake of Oliver St John, whose elder brother Sir John St John was the ancestor of the Barons St John of Bletso and the Earls of Bolingbroke. Moreover, St John&#x27;s nephew Sir John St John, 1st Baronet, of Lydiard Tregoze, was the ancestor of the Viscounts Bolingbroke and the Viscounts St John.

At the time of its creation in 1620, the Grandison viscountcy was given special remainder to the male issue of his niece Barbara Villiers. She was the wife of Sir Edward Villiers, the elder half-brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey and John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck.

In 1626 the 1st Viscount Grandison was also created Baron Tregoz in the Peerage of England, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. On his death in 1630 the barony of Tregoz became extinct as he left no male heirs. He was succeeded in the viscountcy according to the special remainder by William Villiers, the eldest son of Barbara and Sir Edward Villiers. William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison (1614–1643) was a supporter of King Charles I and died of wounds received at the Battle of Bristol in 1643. His daughter the Hon. Barbara Villiers, became the mistress of King Charles II and was created Duchess of Cleveland in 1670.

The second Viscount Grandison had had no sons and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his younger brother, the third Viscount. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Viscount. On his death the title passed to his grandson, the fifth Viscount. He was the son of Brigadier-General the Hon. Edward Villiers (died 1693), eldest son of the fourth Viscount. In 1721 the fifth Viscount was created Earl Grandison in the Peerage of Ireland. However, he left no surviving male heirs and the earldom became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the Grandison viscountcy by his second cousin William Villiers, 3rd Earl of Jersey, who became the sixth Viscount. Lord Jersey was the great-grandson of Sir Edward Villiers, fifth son of Barbara and Sir Edward Villiers. See the Earl of Jersey for further history of the viscountcy.

In 1746 Elizabeth Mason, daughter of John Villiers, 1st Earl Grandison, was created Viscountess Grandison, and in 1767 she was made Viscountess Villiers and Countess Grandison. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. However, they became extinct on the death of the second Earl in 1800.

<doc id="558393" wikidata="Q354695" url="?curid=558393" title="Yakubu Gowon">
<text>Yakubu Dan-Yumma &quot;Jack&quot; Gowon (born 19 October 1934) is a Nigerian former Head of State and statesman who led the Federal military government war efforts during the Nigerian Civil War.

Gowon delivered the famous &quot;no victor, no vanquished&quot; speech at the war&#x27;s end to promote healing and reconciliation. The Nigerian Civil War is listed as one of the deadliest in modern history, with some accusing Gowon of crimes against humanity and genocide. Gowon has maintained that he committed no wrongdoing during the war and that his leadership saved the country.

An Anglican Christian from a minority Ngas ethnic group of Northern Nigeria, Gowon is a Nigerian nationalist, and a believer in the unity and oneness of Nigeria. Gowon&#x27;s rise to power followed the July 1966 counter-coup and cemented military rule in Nigeria. Consequently, Gowon served for the longest continuous period as head of state of Nigeria, ruling for almost nine years until his overthrow in the coup d&#x27;état of 1975 by Brigadier Murtala Mohammed.

==Early life==
Gowon is an Ngas (Angas) from Lur, a small village in the present Kanke Local Government Area of Plateau State. His parents, Nde Yohanna and Matwok Kurnyang, left for Wusasa, Zaria, as Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries in the early days of Gowon&#x27;s life. His father took pride in the fact that he married on 26 April 1923, the same day as the wedding of Prince Albert and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Gowon was the fifth of eleven children. He grew up in Zaria and had his early life and education there. At school, Gowon proved to be a remarkable athlete: he was the school football goalkeeper, pole vaulter, and long-distance runner. He broke the school mile record in his first year. He was also the boxing captain.

==Early career==
Gowon joined the Nigerian Army in 1954 and received his commission as a second lieutenant on 19 October 1955, his 21st birthday. He was trained in the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, UK (1955–56), Staff College, Camberley, UK (1962) as well as the Joint Staff College, Latimer, 1965. He saw action in the Congo as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, both in 1960–61 and in 1963. He advanced to battalion commander position by 1966, at which time he was still a lieutenant colonel.

==1966 coup==
In January 1966, he became Nigeria&#x27;s youngest military chief of staff at the age of 31, because a military coup d&#x27;état by a group of junior officers under Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu led to the overthrow of Nigeria&#x27;s civilian government. In the course of this coup, mostly northern and western leaders were killed, including Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria&#x27;s Prime Minister; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardauna of Sokoto and Premier of the Northern Region; and Samuel Akintola, Premier of the Western Region, Lt Col Arthur Unegbe and so many more. The then Lieutenant Colonel Gowon returned from his course at the Joint Staff College, Latimer UK two days before the coup – a late arrival that possibly exempted him from the plotters&#x27; hit list. The subsequent failure by Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi (who was the head of state following the January 1966 coup-with Gowon his Chief of Staff) to meet Northern demands for the prosecution of the coup plotters further inflamed Northern anger. There was significant support for the coup plotters from both the Eastern Region as well as the mostly left-wing &quot;Lagos-Ibadan&quot; press.

==July counter coup==
Then came Aguyi Ironsi&#x27;s Decree Number 34, which proposed the abolition of the federal system of government in favor of a unitary state, a position which had long been championed by some Southerners-especially by a major section of the Igbo-dominated National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroon (NCNC) This was perhaps wrongly interpreted by Northerners as a Southern (particularly Igbo) attempt at a takeover of all levers of power in the country. The North lagged badly behind the Western and Eastern regions in terms of education (partially due to Islamic doctrine-informed resistance to western cultural and social ethos), while the mostly-Igbo Easterners were already present in the federal civil service.

The original intention of Murtala Mohammed and his fellow coup-plotters was to engineer the secession of the Northern region from Nigeria as a whole, but they were subsequently dissuaded of their plans by several advisors, amongst which were a number of high-ranking civil servants and judges, and importantly emissaries of the British and American governments who had interests in the Nigerian polity. The young officers then decided to name Lieutenant Colonel Gowon, who apparently had not been actively involved in events until that point, as Nigerian Head of State. On ascent to power Gowon reversed Ironsi&#x27;s abrogation of the federal principle.

==Head of state==
In 1966, Gowon was chosen to become head of state. Up until then, Gowon remained strictly a career soldier with no involvement whatsoever in politics, until the tumultuous events of the year suddenly thrust him into a leadership role, when his unusual background as a Northerner who was neither of Hausa nor Fulani ancestry nor of the Islamic faith made him a particularly safe choice to lead a nation whose population was seething with ethnic tension.

Gowon promoted himself twice as Nigerian Head of State. Gowon was a Lt. Colonel upon his ascendancy to the top of the new Federal military government of Nigeria on 1 August 1966, however other senior military officers such as Commodore Joseph Wey, Brigadier Babafemi Ogundipe, and Colonel Robert Adebayo were a part of the government and their military seniority to Gowon was awkward. To stabilize his position as Head of State, Gowon promoted himself to Major-General just before the start of the civil war hostilities in 1967 and to full General at the end of the civil war in 1970.

==Civil war leader==
In anticipation of eastern secession, Gowon moved quickly to weaken the support base of the region by decreeing the creation of twelve new states to replace the four regions. Six of these states contained minority groups that had demanded state creation since the 1950s. Gowon rightly calculated that the eastern minorities would not actively support the Igbos, given the prospect of having their own states if the secession effort were defeated. Many of the federal troops who fought in the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, to bring the Eastern Region back to the federation, were members of minority groups.

The war lasted thirty months and ended in January 1970. In accepting Biafra&#x27;s unconditional cease-fire, Gowon declared that there would be no victor and no vanquished. In this spirit, the years afterward were declared to be a period of rehabilitation, reconstruction, and reconciliation. The oil-price boom, which began as a result of the high price of crude oil (the country&#x27;s major revenue earner) in the world market in 1973, increased the federal government&#x27;s ability to undertake these tasks.

There arose tension between the Eastern Region and the northern controlled federal government led by Gowon. On 4–5 January 1967, in line with Biafran leader Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu&#x27;s demand to meet for talks only on neutral soil, a summit attended by Gowon, Ojukwu and other members of the Supreme Military Council was held at Aburi in Ghana, the stated purpose of which was to resolve all outstanding conflicts and establish Nigeria as a confederation of regions. The outcome of this summit was the Aburi Accord. The Aburi Accord did not see the light of the day, as the Gowon led government had huge consideration for the possible revenues, especially oil revenues which were expected to increase given that reserves having been discovered in the area in the mid-1960s. It has been said without confirmation that both Gowon and Ojukwu had knowledge of the huge oil reserves in the Niger Delta area, which today has grown to be the mainstay of the Nigerian economy.

In a move to check the influence of Ojukwu&#x27;s government in the East, Gowon announced on 5 May 1967 the division of the three Nigerian regions into 12 states: North-Western State, North-Eastern state, Kano State, North-Central State, Benue-Plateau State, Kwara State, Western State, Lagos State, Mid-Western State, and, from Ojukwu&#x27;s Eastern Region, a Rivers State, a South-Eastern State, and an East-Central State. The non-Igbo South-Eastern and Rivers states which had the oil reserves and access to the sea, were carved out to isolate the Igbo areas as East-Central state. One controversial aspect of this move was Gowon&#x27;s annexing of Port Harcourt, a large city in the Niger Delta, in the South of Nigeria (the Ikwerres and Ijaws), sitting on some of Nigeria&#x27;s largest reserves, into the new Rivers State, emasculating the migrant Igbo population of traders there. The flight of many of them back to their villages in the &quot;Igbo heartland&quot; in Eastern Nigeria where they felt safer was alleged to be a contradiction for Gowon&#x27;s &quot;no victor, no vanquished&quot; policy, when at the end of the war, the properties they left behind were claimed by the Rivers State indigenes.

Towards the end of July 1967, Nigerian federal troops and marines captured Bonny Island in the Niger Delta, thereby taking control of vital Shell-BP facilities. Operations began again in May 1968, when Nigeria captured Port Harcourt. Its facilities had been damaged and needed repair. Oil production and export continued, but at a lower level. The completion in 1969 of a new terminal at Forçados brought production up from 142,000 barrels/day in 1958 to 540,000 barrels/day in 1969. In 1970, this figure doubled to 1.08 million barrels/day.

Minority ethnicities of the Eastern Region were rather not sanguine about the prospect of secession, as it would mean living in what they felt would be an Igbo-dominated nation. Some non-Igbos living in the Eastern Region either refrained from offering active support to the Biafran struggle, or actively aided the federal side by enlisting in the Nigerian army and feeding it intelligence about Biafran military activities. However, some did play active roles in the Biafran government, with N.U. Akpan serving as Secretary to the Government, Lt. Col (later Major-General) Philip Effiong, serving as Biafra&#x27;s Chief of Defence Staff and others like Chiefs Bassey and Graham-Douglas serving in other significant roles.

On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu responded to Gowon&#x27;s announcement by declaring the formal secession of the Eastern Region, which was now to be known as the Republic of Biafra. This was to trigger a war that would last some 30 months, and see the deaths of more than 100,000 federal soldiers and three million Biafran combatants and civilians, most of the latter of which perished through starvation under a Nigerian-imposed blockade. The war saw a massive expansion of the Nigerian Army in size and a steep increase in its doctrinal and technical sophistication, while the Nigerian Air Force was essentially born in the course of the conflict. However, significant controversy has surrounded the air operations of the Nigerian Forces, as several residents of Biafra, including Red Cross workers, foreign missionaries and journalists, accused the Nigerian Air Force of specifically targeting civilian populations, relief centers and marketplaces. Gowon has steadfastly denied those claims, along with claims that his army committed atrocities such as rape, wholesale executions of civilian populations and extensive looting in occupied areas; however, one of his wartime commanders, Benjamin Adekunle seems to give some credence to these claims in his book, while excusing them as unfortunate by-products of war.

==&quot;No victor, no vanquished&quot;==

The end of the war came about on 13 January 1970, with Colonel Olusegun Obasanjo&#x27;s acceptance of the surrender of Biafran forces. The next day, Obasanjo announced the situation on the former rebel radio station Radio Biafra Enugu. Gowon subsequently made his famous &quot;no victor, no vanquished&quot; speech, and followed it up with an amnesty for the majority of those who had participated in the Biafran uprising, as well as a program of &quot;Reconciliation, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation&quot;, to repair the extensive damage done to the economy and infrastructure of the Eastern Region during the years of war. Some of these efforts never left the drawing board. In addition to this, Gen. Gowon&#x27;s administration&#x27;s policy of leaving only 20 pounds for Biafrans who had a bank account in Nigeria before the war, regardless of how much money had been in their account, was criticised by foreign and local aid workers, as this led to an unprecedented scale of begging, looting and robbery in the former Biafran areas after the war.

Another decision made by Gowon at the height of the oil boom was to have what some considered negative repercussions for the Nigerian economy in later years, although its immediate effects were scarcely noticeable – his indigenization decree of 1972, which declared many sectors of the Nigerian economy off-limits to all foreign investment, while ruling out more than minority participation by foreigners in several other areas. This decree provided windfall gains to several well-connected Nigerians but proved highly detrimental to non-oil investment in the Nigerian economy.

The post-civil-war years saw Nigeria enjoying a meteoric, oil-fuelled, economic upturn in the course of which the scope of activity of the Nigerian federal government grew to an unprecedented degree, with increased earnings from oil revenues. However, this period also saw a rapid increase in corruption, mostly bribery, of and by federal government officials; and although the head of State himself, Gen. Gowon, was never found complicit in the corrupt practices, he was often accused of turning a blind eye to the activities of his staff and cronies.

On 1 October 1974, in flagrant contradiction to his earlier promises, Gowon declared that Nigeria would not be ready for civilian rule by 1976, and he announced that the handover date would be postponed indefinitely. Furthermore, because of the growth in bureaucracy, there were allegations of rise in corruption. Increased wealth in the country resulted in fake import licenses being issued. There were stories of tons of stones and sand being imported into the country, and of General Gowon himself saying to a foreign reporter that &quot;the only problem Nigeria has is how to spend the money she has.&quot;

==The cement armada affair==
The corruption in Gowon&#x27;s administration culminated in the notorious &quot;cement armada&quot; affair in the summer of 1975, when the port of Lagos became jammed with hundreds of ships trying to unload cement. Somehow, agents of the Nigerian government had signed contracts with 68 different international suppliers for the delivery of a total of 20 million tons of cement in &quot;one year&quot; to Lagos, even though its port could only accept one million tons of cargo per year. Even worse, the poorly drafted cement contracts included demurrage clauses highly favorable to the suppliers, meaning that the bill began to skyrocket if the ships sat in port waiting to unload (or even if they sat in their home ports waiting for permission to depart for Nigeria). The Nigerian government did not fully grasp the magnitude of its mistake until the port of Lagos was so badly jammed that basic supplies could not get through. By that time it was too late. Its attempts to repudiate the cement contracts and impose an emergency embargo on all inbound shipping tied up the country in litigation around the world for many years, including a 1983 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Overthrow==
These scandals provoked serious discontent within the army. On 29 July 1975, while Gowon was attending an OAU summit in Kampala, a group of officers led by Colonel Joe Nanven Garba announced his overthrow. The coup plotters appointed Brigadier Murtala Muhammed as head of the new government, and Brigadier Olusegun Obasanjo as his deputy.
==Years in exile==
Gowon subsequently went into exile in the United Kingdom, where he acquired a Ph.D. in political science as a student at the University of Warwick. His main British residence is on the border of north London and Hertfordshire, where he has very much become part of the English community in his area. He served a term as Churchwarden in his parish church, St Mary the Virgin, Monken Hadley.

==Murtala&#x27;s assassination==
In February 1976, Murtala Mohammed was assassinated in an unsuccessful coup d&#x27;état led by Lt. Col Buka Suka Dimka, who implicated Gowon. According to Dimka&#x27;s &quot;confession&quot;, he met with Gowon in London and obtained support from him for the coup. In addition, Dimka mentioned before his execution that the purpose of the coup d&#x27;état was to re-install Gowon as head of state. As a result of the coup tribunal findings, Gowon was declared wanted by the Nigerian government, stripped of his rank &quot;in absentia&quot;, and had his pension cut off.

Gowon was finally pardoned, along with the ex-Biafran president, Emeka Ojukwu, during the Second Republic under President Shehu Shagari. Gowon&#x27;s rank of general was not restored until 1987 however by General Ibrahim Babangida.

==Later life==
After earning his doctorate at the University of Warwick, Gowon became a professor of political science at the University of Jos in the mid-1980s. Gowon founded his own organization in 1992 called the Yakubu Gowon Centre. The organization is said to work on issues in Nigeria such as good governance as well as infectious disease control including HIV/AIDS, guinea worm, and malaria. Furthermore, Gen. Gowon is also involved in the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme as well as the HIV Programme with Global Fund of Geneva.

In November 2020, MP Tom Tugendhat, while speaking against the Nigerian government&#x27;s repression of the 2020 #EndSARS mass protests, accused Gowon of looting &quot;half of the Central Bank of Nigeria&quot; after his overthrow in the coup d&#x27;état of 1975. The statement, the first-ever attempt to link Gowon with corruption, was faced with considerable backlash within Nigeria, with Bishop Matthew Kukah writing in the national major &quot;Daily Trust&quot; describing the seemingly ridiculous comment as &quot;It is difficult to understand how a Member of the revered British Parliament worth his salt, could have left himself open to ridicule by leveling the unfounded, irrational and bizarre allegations of corruption against General Yakubu Gowon, our former Head of State and to the hilt, the nation&#x27;s poster face of probity in public life.&quot; Following an official demand for an apology by the Nigerian government, the Foreign Office later disassociated itself from the comment stating that, &quot;the said comment of the MP does not reflect the views of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government and the British Government has no mechanism for controlling the actions and speeches of members of the Parliament.&quot;

In February 2024, Gowon, who is the last surviving founder of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), called on the bloc to lift sanctions against Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, whose military-led governments had announced their countries&#x27; departure from the organization in response to the sanctions.

==Personal life==
Gowon married Victoria Zakari, a trained nurse in 1969 at a ceremony officiated by Seth Irunsewe Kale at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.

<doc id="558394" wikidata="Q1122516" url="?curid=558394" title="Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)">
<text>Renegades is the fourth and final studio album by the American rock band Rage Against the Machine, released on December 5, 2000, by Epic Records. It consists of covers of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, Minor Threat, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, the Stooges, MC5, the Rolling Stones, Cypress Hill, Devo and others. The cover is a take on Robert Indiana&#x27;s &quot;Love&quot; artwork series.

Unlike other Rage Against the Machine albums, &quot;Renegades&quot; was not accompanied by a supporting tour due to the band splitting up almost two months before its release. It was certified platinum a little over a month after release. Shortly after the release, the band members, with the exception of lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha, formed a new band, Audioslave, with the former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell.

==Critical reception==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Renegades&quot; has an average score of 78 based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. AllMusic critic John Bush wrote that the record &quot;works well with just a bare few exceptions, in part because Rage Against the Machine is both smart enough to change very little and talented enough to make the songs its own.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described the record as &quot;a tour through three decades of sonic recalcitrance&quot; and &quot;the genome map of seditious sound&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Rob Brunner described the record as &quot;a remarkably diverse, if not exactly surprising, mix of heavy rock, hip hop and protest music&quot;. He said it &quot;would still be a raging success even if this disc does nothing but introduce a new generation to the joys of Bob Dylan and Minor Threat&quot;.

&quot;Mojo&quot; wrote: &quot;This crisp, Rick Rubin-produced outing packs away a machine that was well-oiled to the last.&quot; Kitty Empire of &quot;NME&quot; labeled the record &quot;a brilliant archaeology&quot; and &quot;a sonic history lesson&quot;. The&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Tom Moon said the band executed &quot;diverse tracks&quot; such as Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;, the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Renegades of Funk&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot; with &quot;the roaring, fearless spirit that’s been missing in action since these songs were new&quot;, while &quot;Select&quot; regarded it as their &quot;most satisfying record since their debut&quot;.

<doc id="558395" wikidata="Q3152474" url="?curid=558395" title="Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies">
<text>The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies (PIMS) is a research institute in the University of Toronto that is dedicated to advanced studies in the culture of the Middle Ages.

==Governance==
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Toronto, currently Francis Leo, T.O.P., acts as the chancellor of the institute. The Praeses (or president) of the institute is Augustine Thompson, O.P.

==History==
It was founded in 1929 as the Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael&#x27;s College of the University of Toronto. Étienne Gilson, then of the Sorbonne, was instrumental in its foundation, along with Henry Carr and Edmund J. McCorkell of the Congregation of St. Basil and St. Michael&#x27;s College. In 1939 it was granted a pontifical charter by Pope Pius XII, by which it was given the power to grant licenciate and doctorate degrees in medieval studies.

In 1964 the University of Toronto established the Centre for Medieval Studies as part of the School of Graduate Studies, for students pursuing a master&#x27;s degree or doctorate in medieval studies. Teaching at these levels gradually passed from the institute to the centre. (The centre officially uses the spelling &quot;medieval&quot; while PIMS uses &quot;mediaeval&quot;.) Students of the Centre for Medieval Studies have access to the PIMS building and library.

Up until 1958 the institute had its own charter. From 1958 to 2005, PIMS was a division of the University of St. Michael&#x27;s College. The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies Act of 2005 gave the institute academic autonomy from the university, with which, however, it remains affiliated. Under the act, PIMS is administered by a board of governors with its academic affairs vested in the Institute Council of the academic staff, consisting of fellows and associate fellows.

==Postdoctoral Program and Licence in Mediaeval Studies==
In 1998 the institute became an exclusively postdoctoral research centre, and it accepts students who have recently completed their doctoral studies and wish to conduct specialized research in medieval studies. PIMS offers a Licence in Mediaeval Studies (LMS) as a degree exclusively for students who have completed their postdoctoral studies there. (The application for the LMS refers to it as a &quot;Licentiate&quot; and not as a &quot;Licence.&quot;) Unusually for a Pontifical licentiate, the degree is awarded after its bearer has already earned a doctorate, and not on the way to such.

==Étienne Gilson Lecture==
Since 1979 the institute has hosted an annual lecture from &quot;a senior medievalist&quot; in honour of its co-founder and his research interests. Previous lecturers include Jaroslav Pelikan, Mark D. Jordan, John F. Wippel, Peter Brown, and Francis Oakley. Lectures have been given on topics such as medieval philosophy, medieval art, medicine in the Middle Ages, and medieval historiography.

==Library==
The institute has its own library with over 150,000 volumes, one of the largest collections of medieval documentation in North America. The library is part of the larger system of the University of Toronto Libraries. The library contains over 9,000 reels of microfilm and over 60,000 slides. Materials are non-circulating, and use of the library is generally restricted to PIMS and Centre for Medieval Studies faculty, researchers, and graduate students, though visitor passes may be obtained by contacting the library itself.

==Publishing==
PIMS also has an extensive publishing program that includes its annual journal of research on the Middle Ages, &quot;Mediaeval Studies&quot;, which began in 1939. In 2004, it had reached the 66th volume. A collection of Gilson Lectures focusing on Thomas Aquinas was published in 2008.

==Faculty and fellows==
Faculty and research fellows, visiting and otherwise, associated with PIMS have included:

* Leonard Boyle (1923–1999), sometime Prefect of the Vatican Library
* Osmund Lewry (1929–1987), intellectual historian, specializing in philosophy
* Jacques Maritain (1882–1973), French Catholic philosopher
* John Marenbon (b. 1955), scholar of medieval philosophy
* Joseph Owens (1908–2005), scholar of scholastic philosophy
* Anton Charles Pegis (1905–1978), Thomist philosopher and historian of philosophy
* C. J. Ryan (1943–2004), Italian studies scholar

<text>A rogue planet, also termed a free-floating planet (FFP) or an isolated planetary-mass object (iPMO), is an interstellar object of planetary mass which is not gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf.

Rogue planets may originate from planetary systems in which they are formed and later ejected, or they can also form on their own, outside a planetary system. The Milky Way alone may have billions to trillions of rogue planets, a range the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is expected to refine.

Some planetary-mass objects may have formed in a similar way to stars, and the International Astronomical Union has proposed that such objects be called sub-brown dwarfs. A possible example is Cha 110913−773444, which may either have been ejected and become a rogue planet or formed on its own to become a sub-brown dwarf.

== Terminology ==
The two first discovery papers use the names isolated planetary-mass objects (iPMO) and free-floating planets (FFP). Most astronomical papers use one of these terms. The term rogue planet is more often used for microlensing studies, which also often uses the term FFP. A press release intended for the public might use an alternative name. The discovery of at least 70 FFPs in 2021, for example, used the terms rogue planet, starless planet, wandering planet and free-floating planet in different press releases.

== Discovery ==
Isolated planetary-mass objects (iPMO) were first discovered in 2000 by the UK team Lucas &amp; Roche with UKIRT in the Orion Nebula. In the same year the Spanish team Zapatero Osorio et al. discovered iPMOs with Keck spectroscopy in the σ Orionis cluster. The spectroscopy of the objects in the Orion Nebula was published in 2001. Both European teams are now recognized for their quasi-simultaneous discoveries. In 1999 the Japanese team Oasa &quot;et al.&quot; discovered objects in Chamaeleon I that were spectroscopically confirmed years later in 2004 by the US team Luhman et al.

== Observation ==
There are two techniques to discover free-floating planets: direct imaging and microlensing.

=== Microlensing ===
Astrophysicist Takahiro Sumi of Osaka University in Japan and colleagues, who form the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment collaborations, published their study of microlensing in 2011. They observed 50 million stars in the Milky Way by using the MOA-II telescope at New Zealand&#x27;s Mount John Observatory and the University of Warsaw telescope at Chile&#x27;s Las Campanas Observatory. They found 474 incidents of microlensing, ten of which were brief enough to be planets of around Jupiter&#x27;s size with no associated star in the immediate vicinity. The researchers estimated from their observations that there are nearly two Jupiter-mass rogue planets for every star in the Milky Way. One study suggested a much larger number, up to 100,000 times more rogue planets than stars in the Milky Way, though this study encompassed hypothetical objects much smaller than Jupiter. A 2017 study by Przemek Mróz of Warsaw University Observatory and colleagues, with six times larger statistics than the 2011 study, indicates an upper limit on Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planets per main-sequence star in the Milky Way.

In September 2020, astronomers using microlensing techniques reported the detection, for the first time, of an Earth-mass rogue planet (named OGLE-2016-BLG-1928) unbound to any star and free floating in the Milky Way galaxy.

=== Direct imaging ===

Microlensing planets can only be studied by the microlensing event, which makes the characterization of the planet difficult. Astronomers therefore turn to isolated planetary-mass objects (iPMO) that were found via the direct imaging method. To determine a mass of a brown dwarf or iPMO one needs for example the luminosity and the age of an object. Determining the age of a low-mass object has proven to be difficult. It is no surprise that the vast majority of iPMOs are found inside young nearby star-forming regions of which astronomers know their age. These objects are younger than 200 Myrs, are massive (&gt;5 ) and belong to the L- and T-dwarfs. There is however a small growing sample of cold and old Y-dwarfs that have estimated masses of 8-20 . Nearby rogue planet candidates of spectral type Y include WISE 0855−0714 at a distance of . If this sample of Y-dwarfs can be characterized with more accurate measurements or if a way to better characterize their ages can be found, the number of old and cold iPMOs will likely increase significantly.

The first iPMOs were discovered in the early 2000s via direct imaging inside young star-forming regions. These iPMOs found via direct imaging formed probably like stars (sometimes called sub-brown dwarf). There might be iPMOs that form like a planet, which are then ejected. These objects will however be kinematically different from their natal star-forming region, should not be surrounded by a circumstellar disk and have high metallicity. None of the iPMOs found inside young star-forming regions show a high velocity compared to their star-forming region. For old iPMOs the cold WISE J0830+2837 shows a Vtan of about 100 km/s, which is high, but still consistent with formation in our galaxy. For WISE 1534–1043 one alternative scenario explains this object as an ejected exoplanet due to its high Vtan of about 200 km/s, but its color suggests it is an old metal-poor brown dwarf. Most astronomers studying massive iPMOs believe that they represent the low-mass end of the star-formation process.

Astronomers have used the Herschel Space Observatory and the Very Large Telescope to observe a very young free-floating planetary-mass object, OTS 44, and demonstrate that the processes characterizing the canonical star-like mode of formation apply to isolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. Herschel far-infrared observations have shown that OTS 44 is surrounded by a disk of at least 10 Earth masses and thus could eventually form a mini planetary system. Spectroscopic observations of OTS 44 with the SINFONI spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope have revealed that the disk is actively accreting matter, similar to the disks of young stars.

===Binaries===

The first discovery of a resolved planetary-mass binary was 2MASS J1119–1137AB. There are however other binaries known, such as 2MASS J1553022+153236AB, WISE 1828+2650, WISE 0146+4234, WISE J0336−0143 (could also be a brown dwarf and a planetary-mass object (BD+PMO) binary), NIRISS-NGC1333-12 and several objects discovered by Zhang et al.

In the Orion Nebula a population of 40 wide binaries and 2 triple systems were discovered. The objects were named Jupiter-mass Binary Objects, or JuMBOs. The discovery was surprising for two reasons: the trend of binaries of brown dwarfs predicted a decrease of distance between low mass objects with decreasing mass. It was also predicted that the binary fraction decreases with mass. These binaries were named Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs). They make up at least 9% of the iPMOs and have a separation smaller than 340 AU. It is unclear how these JuMBOs formed, but an extensive study argued that they formed in situ, like stars. If they formed like stars, then there must be an unknown &quot;extra ingredient&quot; to allow them to form. If they formed like planets and were later ejected, then it has to be explained why these binaries did not break apart during the ejection process. Future measurements with JWST might resolve if these objects formed as ejected planets or as stars. Kevin Luhman reanalysed the NIRCam data and found that most JuMBOs did not appear in his sample of substellar objects. Moreover the color was consistent with reddened background sources or low signal-to-noise sources. He considers only JuMBO 29 as a good candidate for a binary planetary-mass system.

=== Total number of known iPMOs ===
There are likely hundreds of known candidate iPMOs, over a hundred objects with spectra and a small but growing number of candidates discovered via microlensing. Some large surveys include:

As of December 2021, the largest-ever group of rogue planets was discovered, numbering at least 70 and up to 170 depending on the assumed age. They are found in the OB association between Upper Scorpius and Ophiuchus with masses between 4 and 13 and age around 3 to 10 million years, and were most likely formed by either gravitational collapse of gas clouds, or formation in a protoplanetary disk followed by ejection due to dynamical instabilities. Follow-up observations with spectroscopy from the Subaru Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias showed that the contamination of this sample is quite low (≤6%). The 16 young objects had a mass between 3 and 14 , confirming that they are indeed planetary-mass objects.

In October 2023 an even larger group of 540 planetary-mass object candidates was discovered in the Trapezium Cluster and inner Orion Nebula with JWST. The objects have a mass between 13 and 0.6 . A surprising number of these objects formed wide binaries, which was not predicted.

== Formation ==
There are in general two scenarios that can lead to the formation of an isolated planetary-mass object (iPMO). It can form like a planet around a star and is then ejected, or it forms like a low-mass star or brown dwarf in isolation. This can influence its composition and motion.

=== Formation like a star ===

Objects with a mass of at least one Jupiter mass were thought to be able to form via collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds from models in 2001. Pre-JWST observations have shown that objects below 3-5 are unlikely to form on their own. Observations in 2023 in the Trapezium Cluster with JWST have shown that objects as massive as 0.6 might form on their own, not requiring a steep cut-off mass. A particular type of globule, called globulettes, are thought to be birthplaces for brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects. Globulettes are found in the Rosette Nebula and IC 1805. Sometimes young iPMOs are still surrounded by a disk that could form exomoons. Due to the tight orbit of this type of exomoon around their host planet, they have a high chance of 10-15% to be transiting.

==== Disks ====
Some very young star-forming regions, typically younger than 5 million years, sometimes contain isolated planetary-mass objects with infrared excess and signs of accretion. Most well known is the iPMO OTS 44 discovered to have a disk and being located in Chamaeleon I. Chamaeleon I and II have other candidate iPMOs with disks. Other star-forming regions with iPMOs with disks or accretion are Lupus I, Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex, Sigma Orionis cluster, Orion Nebula, Taurus, NGC 1333 and IC 348. A large survey of disks around brown dwarfs and iPMOs with ALMA found that these disks are not massive enough to form earth-mass planets. There is still the possibility that the disks already have formed planets. Studies of red dwarfs have shown that some have gas-rich disks at a relative old age. These disks were dubbed Peter Pan Disks and this trend could continue into the planetary-mass regime. One Peter Pan disk is the 45 Myr old brown dwarf 2MASS J02265658-5327032 with a mass of about 13.7 , which is close to the planetary-mass regime. Recent studies of the nearby planetary-mass object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 found that this nearby iPMO is surrounded by a disk. It shows signs of accretion from the disk and also infrared excess.

=== Formation like a planet ===
Ejected planets are predicted to be mostly low-mass (&lt;30 Figure 1 Ma et al.) and their mean mass depends on the mass of their host star. Simulations by Ma et al. did show that 17.5% of 1 stars eject a total of 16.8 per star with a typical (median) mass of 0.8 for an individual free-floating planet (FFP). For lower mass red dwarfs with a mass of 0.3 12% of stars eject a total of 5.1 per star with a typical mass of 0.3 for an individual FFP.

Hong et al. predicted that exomoons can be scattered by planet-planet interactions and become ejected exomoons. Higher mass (0.3-1 ) ejected FFP are predicted to be possible, but they are also predicted to be rare. Ejection of a planet can occur via planet-planet scatter or due a stellar flyby. Another possibility is the ejection of a fragment of a disk that then forms into a planetary-mass object. Another suggested scenario is the ejection of planets in a tilted circumbinary orbit. Interactions with the central binary and the planets with each other can lead to the ejection of the lower-mass planet in the system.

=== Other scenarios ===
If a stellar or brown dwarf embryo experiences a halted accretion, it could remain low-mass enough to become a planetary-mass object. Such a halted accretion could occur if the embryo is ejected or if its circumstellar disk experiences photoevaporation near O-stars. Objects that formed via the ejected embryo scenario would have smaller or no disk and the fraction of binaries decreases for such objects. It could also be that free-floating planetary-mass objects for from a combination of scenarios.

== Fate ==
Most isolated planetary-mass objects will float in interstellar space forever.

Some iPMOs will have a close encounter with a planetary system. This rare encounter can have three outcomes: The iPMO will remain unbound, it could be weakly bound to the star, or it could &quot;kick out&quot; the exoplanet, replacing it. Simulations have shown that the vast majority of these encounters result in a capture event with the iPMO being weakly bound with a low gravitational binding energy and an elongated highly eccentric orbit. These orbits are not stable and 90% of these objects gain energy due to planet-planet encounters and are ejected back into interstellar space. Only 1% of all stars will experience this temporary capture.

== Warmth ==

Interstellar planets generate little heat and are not heated by a star. However, in 1998, David J. Stevenson theorized that some planet-sized objects adrift in interstellar space might sustain a thick atmosphere that would not freeze out. He proposed that these atmospheres would be preserved by the pressure-induced far-infrared radiation opacity of a thick hydrogen-containing atmosphere.

During planetary-system formation, several small protoplanetary bodies may be ejected from the system. An ejected body would receive less of the stellar-generated ultraviolet light that can strip away the lighter elements of its atmosphere. Even an Earth-sized body would have enough gravity to prevent the escape of the hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere. In an Earth-sized object the geothermal energy from residual core radioisotope decay could maintain a surface temperature above the melting point of water, allowing liquid-water oceans to exist. These planets are likely to remain geologically active for long periods. If they have geodynamo-created protective magnetospheres and sea floor volcanism, hydrothermal vents could provide energy for life. These bodies would be difficult to detect because of their weak thermal microwave radiation emissions, although reflected solar radiation and far-infrared thermal emissions may be detectable from an object that is less than 1,000 astronomical units from Earth. Around five percent of Earth-sized ejected planets with Moon-sized natural satellites would retain their satellites after ejection. A large satellite would be a source of significant geological tidal heating.

== List ==
The table below lists rogue planets, confirmed or suspected, that have been discovered. It is yet unknown whether these planets were ejected from orbiting a star or else formed on their own as sub-brown dwarfs. Whether exceptionally low-mass rogue planets (such as OGLE-2012-BLG-1323 and KMT-2019-BLG-2073) are even capable of being formed on their own is currently unknown.

=== Discovered via direct imaging ===
These objects were discovered with the direct imaging method. Many were discovered in young star-clusters or stellar associations and a few old are known (such as WISE 0855−0714). List is sorted after discovery year.
=== Discovered via microlensing ===
These objects were discovered via microlensing. Rogue planets discovered via microlensing can only be studied by the lensing event. Some of them could also be exoplanets in a wide orbit around an unseen star.
=== Discovered via transit ===

<text>Roger Anthony Lloyd-Pack (8 February 1944 – 16 January 2014) was a British actor. He is best known for playing Trigger in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; from 1981 to 2003, and Owen Newitt in &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; from 1994 to 2007. He later starred as Tom in &quot;The Old Guys&quot; with Clive Swift. He is also well known for the role of Barty Crouch Sr. in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and for his appearances in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as John Lumic in the episodes &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;.

==Early life==
Lloyd-Pack was born in 1944 in Islington, London, the son of actor Charles Lloyd-Pack (1902–1983) and Ulrike Elisabeth (&quot;née&quot; Pulay, 1921–2000), an Austrian Jewish refugee who worked as a travel agent. His uncle was George Pulay, one of the secret listeners to German POW in Trent Park during World War II. He attended Bedales School near Petersfield in Hampshire, where he achieved A Level passes in English, French and Latin. He subsequently trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), graduating in 1965 with an Acting (RADA Diploma).

==Career==
Lloyd-Pack began his acting career at Northampton&#x27;s Royal Theatre, making his stage debut in the Thomas Dekker play &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot;.

He featured on an episode of The Professionals (Long Shot 1978) as a terrorist hitman.

=== &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; ===
On British television, he was best known for portraying &quot;Trigger&quot;, Del Boy&#x27;s slow-witted “Village idiot” friend in the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, from 1981 to 2003.

Lloyd-Pack was cast by pure chance: an &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; executive producer, Ray Butt, hired him to portray the character Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, and had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray.

=== Later career ===
He was also known for his role in &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; as Owen Newitt and to international audiences for his performance as Barty Crouch, Sr. in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. In addition, he had a semi-regular role during the 1990s as the plumber Jake &quot;The Klingon&quot; Klinger, Ben Porter&#x27;s arch-rival, in the sitcom &quot;2point4 Children.&quot;

In 2005, he appeared in the second series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Doc Martin&quot; as a farmer who held a grudge against Doctor Ellingham for what he believed was the malpractice-related death of his wife. In 2006, he played John Lumic and provided the voice of the Cyber-Controller in two episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, opposite David Tennant, who had played his son in the same &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film. Lloyd-Pack&#x27;s final TV appearance was in &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot; as Alex Greene.

He voiced the pre-match build-up montage video shown ahead of all Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s home matches which is still played today.

In June 2008, he appeared as a guest on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Politics Show&quot;, arguing the case for better-integrated public transport (specifically railways), and, in January 2012, he and fellow actor Sarah Parish supported a campaign to raise £1million for The Bridge School in Islington.

In 2012, he portrayed the Duke of Buckingham in the play &quot;Richard III&quot;, and in 2013, portrayed Sir Andrew Aguecheek in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, both plays by William Shakespeare, both at the Apollo Theatre, London.

==Personal life==
Lloyd-Pack was married twice: first to Sheila Ball, from whom he was divorced in 1972, and secondly to the poet and dramatist Jehane Markham (daughter of David Markham), whom he married in 2000. He had a daughter, actress Emily Lloyd and three sons. He later lived in Kentish Town, North London, and also had a home near Fakenham in Norfolk.

Lloyd-Pack was a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur.

He was an honorary patron of the London children&#x27;s charity Scene &amp; Heard.

In a 2008 interview, when asked what profession he would have chosen aside from acting, Lloyd-Pack said: &quot;Psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst or something in the psycho world because I&#x27;ve always been interested in that... or I might have been a photographer... I also would have loved to have been a musician.&quot; In that same interview, he listed his favourite directors as Peter Gill, Harold Pinter, Richard Eyre, Thea Sharrock and Tina Packer, and listed actor Paul Scofield as both a favourite and influence.

=== Political views ===
Lloyd-Pack supported the Labour Party and campaigned for Ken Livingstone in the 2012 London mayoral election. However, in 2013, he signed a letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating he had withdrawn his support from the Labour Party, in favour of a new party of the left, Left Unity.

==Death and tributes==

Lloyd-Pack died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Kentish Town, aged 69, on 16 January 2014. His funeral was held at the church of St. Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden. It was attended by Sir David Jason, Nicholas Lyndhurst, John Challis and Sue Holderness. He was buried at Highgate Cemetery East.

Nigel Havers, Stephen Rea, Miranda Richardson, Alison Steadman, Kathy Burke and Joely Richardson paid tribute to him.

In March that year, the Sport Relief special of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; was dedicated to the memory of both Lloyd-Pack and John Sullivan. Similarly, the final episode of the lockdown edition of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; ended with a tribute just before the closing credits reading, &quot;In loving memory of Liz, John, Emma and Roger&quot;, paying tribute to him and three other late Dibley cast members (Liz Smith, John Bluthal and Emma Chambers). The third episode of series 8 of &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot;, which Lloyd-Pack appeared in, aired two months after his death and similarly ended with a tribute title card.

<text>The Alaska boundary dispute was a territorial dispute between the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which then controlled Canada&#x27;s foreign relations. It was resolved by arbitration in 1903. The dispute had existed between the Russian Empire and Britain since 1821, and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the Alaska Purchase in 1867. The final resolution favored the American position, as Canada did not get an all-Canadian outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea. The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States, and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in favor of healthier Anglo-American relations.

== Background ==

===1825–1897===

In 1825 Russia and the United Kingdom signed a treaty to define the borders of their respective colonial possessions, the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. Part of the wording of the treaty was that:

The vague phrase &quot;the mountains parallel to the coast&quot; was further qualified thus:

This part of the treaty language was an agreement on general principles for establishing a boundary in the area in the future, rather than any exact demarcated line.

Signed in 1839, the RAC–HBC Agreement created an understanding between the Russian-American Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Typically referred to as the &quot;lisière&quot; (edge), a stretch of the Alaskan Panhandle from Cross Sound to 54° 40′ was given to the HBC as a fur trade monopoly in exchange for the agricultural and pastoral products produced by its subsidiary, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, along with an annual amount of furs given to the Russian company. The lease was renewed until the end of Russian America. This lease was later brought up by the Province of British Columbia as bearing upon its own territorial interests in the region, but was ignored by Ottawa and London.

The United States bought Alaska in 1867 from Russia in the Alaska Purchase, but the boundary terms were ambiguous. In 1871, British Columbia united with the new Dominion of Canada. The Canadian government requested a survey of the boundary, but the United States rejected it as too costly; the border area was very remote and sparsely settled, and without economic or strategic interest. In 1898, the national governments agreed on a compromise, but the government of British Columbia rejected it. U.S. President McKinley proposed a permanent lease to Canada of a port near Haines, but Canada rejected that compromise.

===Klondike gold rush===
In 1897–98 the Klondike Gold Rush in Yukon, Canada, enormously increased the population of the general area, which reached 30,000, composed largely of Americans. Some 100,000 fortune seekers moved through Alaska to the Klondike gold region. From a population of 500 in 1896, the village&#x27;s population grew to approximately 17,000 people by summer 1898. 

The presence of gold and a large new population greatly increased the importance of the region and the desirability of fixing an exact boundary. Canada wanted an all-Canadian route from the gold fields to a seaport. There were reports that Canadian citizens were harassed by the United States as a deterrent to making any land claims.

==Arbitration==

The posts set up on the passes by the NWMP were effective in the short term, as the provisional boundary was accepted, if grudgingly. In September 1898, serious negotiations began between the United States and Canada to settle the issue, but those meetings failed. 

The treaty of 1825 had been drawn up in French, and the 1903 British advocates discussed the exact meaning of words like &quot;/coast&quot;, &quot;/strip&quot; and &quot;/crest&quot;. The maps of George Vancouver, which were used as a fixing line by the commission of 1825, showed a continuous line of mountains parallel to the coast — however, the mountain range is neither parallel to the coast nor continuous.

Finally, in 1903, the Hay–Herbert Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom entrusted the decision to an arbitration by a mixed tribunal of six members: three Americans (Elihu Root, Secretary of War; Henry Cabot Lodge, senator from Massachusetts; and George Turner, ex-senator from Washington), two Canadians (Sir Louis A. Jette, Lieutenant Governor of Quebec; and Allen B. Aylesworth, K.C., from Toronto), and one Briton (Baron Alverstone). Aylesworth had replaced John D. Armour, the Chief Justice of Ontario, who died in London on July 11, 1903, while working on the boundary commission. All sides respected Root, but he was a member of the U.S. Cabinet. Canadians ridiculed the choice of the obscure ex-Senator Turner and, especially, Lodge, a leading historian and diplomatic specialist whom they saw as unobjective.

The tribunal considered six main points:
* Where the boundary began.
* What &quot;Portland Channel&quot; meant, and how to draw the boundary line through it. Four islands were in dispute.
* The definition of the line from &quot;the southernmost point of Prince of Wales Island to Portland Channel&quot;, which depended on the answer to the previous question.
* The line from Portland Channel to the 56th parallel north.
* The width of the (border or edge), and how to measure it.
* Whether mountain ranges existed in the area.

The British member Lord Alverstone sided with the U.S. position on these basic issues. The agreed demarcation line was a compromise falling roughly between the maximal U.S. and maximal Canadian claim. The &quot;BC Panhandle&quot; (the Tatshenshini-Alsek region) was not quite exclaved from the rest of British Columbia.

In 1929, Canadian scholar Hugh L. L. Keenlyside concluded, &quot;The Americans, of course, did have the better case.&quot; He judged that most of the tribunal&#x27;s decisions were fair. Regarding the key issue of the islands in the Portland Channel, however,

This was one of several concessions that Britain offered to the United States (the others being on fisheries and the Panama Canal). It was part of a general policy of ending the chill in Britain–U.S. relations, achieving rapprochement, winning American favor, and resolving outstanding issues (the Great Rapprochement).

==Aftermath==

===Growth of a distinct Canadian identity===
Keenlyside and Brown wrote that

The Canadian judges refused to sign the award, issued on 20 October 1903, due to the Canadian delegates&#x27; disagreement with Lord Alverstone&#x27;s vote. Canadians protested the outcome, not so much the decision itself but that the Americans had chosen politicians instead of jurists for the tribunal, and that the British had helped their own interests by betraying Canada&#x27;s. This led to intense anti-British emotions erupting throughout Canada (including Quebec) as well as a surge in Canadian nationalism as separate from an imperial identity. Although suspicions of the U.S. provoked by the award may have contributed to Canada&#x27;s rejection of a free trade with the United States in the 1911 &quot;reciprocity election&quot;, historian F. W. Gibson concluded that Canadians vented their anger less upon the United States and &quot;to a greater degree upon Great Britain for having offered such feeble resistance to American aggressiveness. The circumstances surrounding the settlement of the dispute produced serious dissatisfaction with Canada&#x27;s position in the British Empire.&quot; Infuriated, like most Canadians, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier explained to Parliament, &quot;So long as Canada remains a dependency of the British Crown the present powers that we have are not sufficient for the maintenance of our rights.&quot; Canadian anger gradually subsided, but the feeling that Canada should control its own foreign policy may have contributed to the Statute of Westminster.

<doc id="558430" wikidata="Q377327" url="?curid=558430" title="Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester">
<text>Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester (1577 – 18 December 1646) was an English aristocrat, who was a prominent and financially important Royalist during the early years of the English Civil War.

==Life==
He was the son of Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and Elizabeth Hastings. On 3 March 1628, he succeeded his father and became the 5th Earl of Worcester.

Brought up a Protestant, he converted to Catholicism as a young man. He was considered an outstandingly wealthy peer, with an income, by the contemporary estimate of Richard Symonds, of £24,000 per annum. By good management, as well as by inheritance and marriage, he built up major holdings in property. When war came, he claimed to have expended and lent over £900,000 to the royalist cause.

Charles I asked him to keep a low profile in public life. Some noted recusants, such as Gwilym Puw and his chaplain Thomas Bayly, gathered around him at Raglan Castle. His local support was increased by the fact that he was not identified as a courtier. For his financial support of King Charles I at the outset of the First English Civil War, he was created 1st Marquess of Worcester, on 2 November 1642.

After the battle of Naseby, King Charles sought refuge at Raglan, in the period June to September 1645. The next year, the Marquess was forced to surrender Raglan Castle to the forces of Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet, late in 1646, marking the effective end of the Civil War in Wales. He was taken into custody by the Parliamentary forces, and died in Covent Garden, on 18 December 1646.

== Family ==
On 16 June 1600 he married Anne Russell, a daughter of John Russell, Baron Russell (eldest son and heir apparent of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford) by his wife Elizabeth Cooke. The wedding procession with Queen Elizabeth I in a litter is depicted in a painting by Robert Peake the Elder. Afterwards there was a feast and a masque, a &#x27;strange dance newly invented&#x27; performed by eight women dressed in silver skirts and gold waistcoats led by Mary Fitton. The others masque dancers were &quot;Lady Dougherty&quot; (Dorothy Hastings), Mistress Carey, Mistress Onslow, Mistress Southwell, Bess Russell, Mistress Darcy, and Blanche Somerset. The queen herself joined the dance.

Anne&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford and his wife Margaret St. John. Anne&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Sir Anthony Cooke and his wife Anne FitzWilliam. A splendid portrait of Anne Russell painted shortly after her marriage sold for 297,000 GBP at Sotheby&#x27;s London on 2 May 2018.

With his wife, he had nine sons and four daughters including, Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, his heir and successor, and Thomas Somerset, his second son, who became a Catholic priest in Rome before joining the Oratory of St Philip Neri in Perugia before Pope Clement IX sent him to England as his internuncio. Fr Thomas died in exile in Dunkirk on 30 August 1678. Another son was Sir John Somerset, of Pauntley, Gloucestershire, who married Mary Arundell, a daughter of the 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, co. Wiltshire by his second wife. His youngest daughter, Elizabeth, married Francis Browne, 3rd Viscount Montagu.

<doc id="558435" wikidata="Q2504748" url="?curid=558435" title="Evil Heat">
<text>Evil Heat is the seventh studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was first released on 5 August 2002 in the United Kingdom by Columbia Records and on 26 November 2002 in the United States by Epic Records. It peaked at number 9 on the UK Albums Chart. Musically, its style forms a link between two of the band&#x27;s previous albums: the aggressive protest of &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; (2000), and the acid house psychedelia of &quot;Screamadelica&quot; (1991).

==Composition==
The track &quot;Rise&quot; was originally titled &quot;Bomb the Pentagon&quot;, and debuted as part of the band&#x27;s live set in summer 2001. In light of the 11 September 2001 attacks, both the lyrics and title of the song were reworked, and the revised version appears on the album. &quot;Space Blues #2&quot;, written and performed solely by Martin Duffy, is a follow-up to &quot;Space Blues&quot;, a song by his previous band Felt.

==Critical reception==

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 24 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Playlouder ranked the album at number 35 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2002.

<doc id="558440" wikidata="Q1004306" url="?curid=558440" title="Nida, Lithuania">
<text>Nida (, Kursenieki: &quot;Nīde&quot;) is a resort town in Lithuania, the administrative centre of Neringa municipality. Located on the Curonian Spit between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, it is the westernmost point of Lithuania and the Baltic states, close to the border with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast exclave. It currently has about 2,385 residents.

== History ==

A settlement area of the Baltic Curonians, the original place called &quot;nida&quot; (&quot;fluent&quot; in the Old Prussian language) was first mentioned in 1385 documents issued by the Teutonic Knights, who ruled the lands within their Monastic State. The original settlement on the road along the Curonian Spit from Königsberg to Memel was located about south of its today&#x27;s position near the &quot;Hohe Düne&quot; (High Dune) at Cape Grobštas (from Old Prussian: &quot;grabis&quot;, &quot;hill&quot;). After the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the fishing village became part of the Polish fief held by the Teutonic Knights until 1525, and by Ducal Prussia.

From 1701, it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1709 nearly all of the population died from a bubonic plague epidemic. Continuously threatened by sand drifts, the village was moved away from the approaching dune to today&#x27;s position in the 1730s. Incorporated into the Prussian Province of East Prussia in 1773, it became part of the German Empire upon the German unification of 1871. In 1874 a lighthouse on Urbas hill was built, later destroyed in the war and rebuilt in 1945 and 1953. In 1878, the village had a population of 655, mostly living off fishing, with fish being sold mainly to nearby Klaipėda and other coastal towns. Nida already was the largest village of the Curonian Spit. Both Lithuanian and German-language church services were held there.

===Artists&#x27; colony===

From the late 19th century, the dune landscape became popular with landscape and animal painters from the &quot;Kunstakademie Königsberg&quot; arts school. The local inn of Herman Blode was the nucleus of the expressionist artists&#x27; colony (&quot;Künstlerkolonie Nidden&quot;). Lovis Corinth sojourned there, as did Max Pechstein, Alfred Lichtwark, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Alfred Partikel. Painters from Königsberg such as Julius Freymuth and Eduard Bischoff visited the area, as did poets such as Ernst Wiechert and Carl Zuckmayer. Other guests included Ernst Kirchner, Ernst Mollenhauer, Franz Domscheit, and Hermann Wirth. The painters usually took accommodations at Blode&#x27;s hotel, and left some of their works with him. Some also built their own residences in the vicinity.

After World War I Nidden, together with the northern half of the Curonian Spit, became part of the Klaipėda Region under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, but was subsequently incorporated to Lithuania in 1923. Renamed Nida, the village nevertheless remained a predominantly German settlement; the border with the remaining German (East Prussian) half of the spit lay only a few kilometers to the south.

In 1929 Nobel Prize-winning writer Thomas Mann visited Nida while on holiday in nearby Rauschen and decided to have a summer house erected on a hill above the lagoon; it was mocked by locals as &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. He and his family spent the summers of 1930–32 in the cottage, and parts of the epic novel &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot; were written there.

Threatened by the Nazis due to his political views, Mann left Germany after Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; in 1933 and eventually emigrated to the United States. After the Klaipėda Region was again annexed by (now Nazified) Germany in 1939, his house was seized at the behest of Hermann Göring and designated a recreation home for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; officers.

===Post-war===
In 1939 the town had 736 inhabitants. Like all of the Curonian Spit, Nida became nearly uninhabited as a result of the advancing Red Army, the Evacuation of East Prussia and the eventual expulsion of surviving German inhabitants. After the end of World War II, Nida again became part of then Soviet-occupied Lithuania. In the early postwar period, Nida was a little-visited fishing village. Later during the Soviet occupation, together with three other villages of the Neringa Municipality (Juodkrantė, Preila and Pervalka), Nida was a controlled-entry holiday resort reserved for the Communist party officials and elite (nomenklatura).

Since Lithuania restored its independence in 1990, the area has been open to all and the tourism has flourished. However, as Curonian Spit is a national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, there are various restrictions to protect its ecosystem and the unique architecture of towns like Nida.

Mann&#x27;s summer cottage survived the war and was preserved on the initiative of the Lithuanian poet Antanas Venclova. A first memorial site was inaugurated already in 1967. During the Soviet occupation, it hosted a library open in summer only, with residential quarters of the visiting librarian posted from Klaipėda upstairs and public areas downstairs. In 1995/96 the house was restored according to the original architectural design and reopenend as a cultural center dedicated to the writer, with a memorial exhibition and an annual festival.

==Climate==
Klaipėda&#x27;s climate is considered to be humid continental, (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), although it borders quite closely to oceanic, (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), when using the -3 °C isotherm, because of the proximity to the Baltic Sea, which is less prone to extreme weather events than the climate inland.

==Tourism==
The town is an upmarket holiday resort, hosting about 200,000 to 300,000 tourists each summer, mostly Lithuanians, Germans, Latvians, and Russians. It is characterized by low-key entertainment and a distinct family focus. However, during recent years it has become a decent point of interest for fine electronica music and modern art shows at an eclectic forest retreat.

Since 2001, Nida Jazz Festival has been held every year. A local radio station Neringa FM streams live beats over FM and online. There are also interesting places to see nearby, including some of the highest sand dunes in Europe, a large sundial (which has been restored after being damaged by a Baltic gale), Fisherman&#x27;s Ethnographic Homestead, gallery-museum of amber and a German Protestant (&quot;Evangelische&quot;) Brick Gothic church (built in 1888). There is also a campsite.

The town is known for &quot;Nidden Kurenwimpel&quot; — German for &quot;Curonian pennants&quot; — ornate carved flags particular to local families resident on the Curonian Spit. The flags, replicas of which can be seen around Nida, feature animal and human figures as pictograms reminiscent of a pagan writing tradition. At the local cemetery, examples of &quot;krikštas&quot; (pl. &quot;krikštai&quot;), pagan burial markers in place of tombstones, can still be seen.

Nida&#x27;s beach participates in the Blue Flag Programme. Nudists make use of parts of the beach near Nida for nude bathing.

==Transportation==

Nida Airport is located in the town, but it has no scheduled routes and only capable of handling small aircraft. Nida also has a seaport which is used for ferries and fishing boats.

The only road which runs along the whole length of the Curonian Spit, connecting Zelenogradsk and Smiltynė (where a ferry connection to Klaipėda exists), passes through the edge of Nida. An hourly bus runs between Nida and Smiltynė ferry terminal on that road, and intercity buses to various cities like Kaliningrad, Klaipėda, Kaunas and Vilnius exist.

<doc id="558453" wikidata="Q827612" url="?curid=558453" title="Jugurthine War">
<text>The Jugurthine War (; 112–106 BC) was an armed conflict between the Roman Republic and King Jugurtha of Numidia, a kingdom on the north African coast approximating to modern Algeria. Jugurtha was the nephew and adopted son of Micipsa, king of Numidia, whom he succeeded to the throne; he had done so by overcoming his rivals through assassination, war, and bribery.

Following Jugurtha&#x27;s usurpation of the throne of Numidia, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome felt compelled to intervene. The war constituted an important phase in the Roman subjugation of Northern Africa and the rise of the empire, but Numidia did not become a Roman province until 46 BC.

==Jugurtha and Numidia==

Numidia was a kingdom located in North Africa (roughly corresponding to northern modern day Algeria) adjacent to what had been Rome&#x27;s arch enemy, Carthage. King Masinissa, who was a steadfast ally of Rome in the Third Punic War, died in 149 BC, and was succeeded by his son Micipsa, who ruled 149–118 BC. At the time of his death, Micipsa had three potential heirs: his two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal I, and an illegitimate nephew, Jugurtha. Jugurtha had fought under Scipio Aemilianus at the siege of Numantia, where, through friendship with Roman aristocrats, he had formed an acquaintance with Roman manners and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that at his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha, with the realm to be divided into three. After King Micipsa&#x27;s death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms; however, they were unable to agree on the terms of division, and Jugurtha declared open war on the other two kings. Hiempsal, who, though the younger, was the braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha&#x27;s agents, and Adherbal, unable to defend himself, was defeated and forced to flee to Rome, where he appealed for arbitration to the Roman Senate.

Although the Senate was given authority by Micipsa to arbitrate his will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes. The Roman Senate organized a commission, led by the ex-Consul Lucius Opimius, to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining two contestants, starting in 116 BC. However, Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission into allotting him the better, more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east. Powerless against Roman corruption, Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly thereafter, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his cousin anyway, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into Cirta, Adherbal&#x27;s capital. Jugurtha&#x27;s goal was now to conquer, and thus unite, Numidia under his rule.

Rome, seeing this as a threat to stability in the region, sided with Adherbal. With Roman help, Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Roman Equites who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate granted his request. The Roman Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to end the war and recognize Abherbal&#x27;s right to his kingdom. The Jugurtha ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second delegation, this time headed by Consul Marcus Scaurus, a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten Jugurtha into submission. King Jugurtha, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus and Adherbal long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with all Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta. The deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furor among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune Gaius Memmius, finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC and joined the late Adherbal&#x27;s side in the war, though with reluctance.

==Bestia==
Lucius Calpurnius Bestia, consul for the year, was appointed to command the Roman army in Africa against Jugurtha. He was accompanied by Scaurus and other experienced officers, and received an offer of alliance from Bocchus I, king of Mauretania. The defection of Bocchus, his own father-in-law, filled Jugurtha with alarm, and he sent to the Roman consul to surrender. Ceasing to regard him as a threat, the Roman senators granted him a treaty on extremely lenient terms: Numidia was restored to Jugurtha intact, in exchange for bribes to the Senate, a small additional fine, and the remittal of his war-elephants (which he later bought back at reduced price from corrupt officers). In fact, the treaty of Jugurtha&#x27;s terms of surrender were so favorable that it led to a renewal of the popular outcry at Rome; at the demand of the tribune Memmius, an investigation was launched into the proceedings of the treaty. Jugurtha was summoned to Rome– with the promise of a safe conduct transit –and appeared as a witness. Rather than complying with the inquisition, he bribed two Roman Tribunes to veto the proceedings and prevent him from testifying. In the ensuing outrage, Jugurtha&#x27;s cousin Massiva, who had fled to Rome in fear of his cousin, seized the opportunity to press his own claim to the Numidian throne. Jugurtha assassinated him, and the Senate, though initially inclined to accept bribery again to allow him to escape retribution, was ultimately compelled by his insolence and by the fury of the mob to expel him from the city and revoke the recent peace. The armies of Rome were to return to Jugurtha&#x27;s Numidia

==Spurius, Aulus Postumius==
The consul Spurius Postumius Albinus took command of the Roman army in Africa (110 BC), but failed to carry out energetic action, due to incompetence, indiscipline in his army, and – it was alleged – bribery by Jugurtha. Later in the year Albinus returned to Italy, leaving the command to his brother, Aulus Postumius Albinus. The latter, more active though no more able than his brother, decided on a bold strike, marching in mid-winter to besiege the town of Suthul, where the Numidian treasury was kept; however, the town was strongly garrisoned and excellently fortified and could not be captured. Postumius, anxious not to have retreated without striking the enemy a blow, allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the Sahara, where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army was killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under a yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender. The beaten Postumius signed a treaty permanently naming Jugurtha the king of all of Numidia and returning to the peace concluded with Bestia and Scaurus. The Senate, however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.

==Metellus==

After Postumius&#x27; defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian Quintus Metellus, who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting men as officers for the campaign based on ability rather than of rank. Both Gaius Marius (a plebeian from Arpinum) and the noted disciplinarian and military theorist Publius Rutilius Rufus documented Metellus&#x27; commitment to merit and expertise in his officer corps. 

When Metellus arrived in Africa in 109 BC, he first had to retrain the army and institute some form of military discipline. In the spring he led his reorganised army into Numidia. Jugurtha was alarmed and opened negotiations, where Metellus attempted to convince the royal envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus&#x27; intentions, broke off the talks and withdrew south beyond the Numidian mountains, taking up position on the plains behind them.
Metellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the Muthul River. Jugurtha had divided his army into two detachments, one of which (composed of cavalry and the best of his infantry) lay south of the mountain on the right flank of the Romans, who were marching to the river Muthul, which lay parallel to the mountains, 18 miles to the south; the second detachment (formed of war-elephants and the rest of the infantry) lay further south, closer to the river.
Metellus handled the situation by sending one force directly south to the river under Rufus while the rest under Metellus and Marius marched obliquely south-west to dislodge Jugurtha from his position, preventing him from hindering the march of the first body to the river. Jugurtha, however, displaying excellent generalship, dispatched an infantry column formation to hold the mountain passes as soon as the Romans had descended into the plain, thus cutting off their line of retreat; meanwhile, his cavalry Metellus&#x27; detachment of infantry in swarms along the plain. The Romans were unable to respond effectively since they only had heavy cavalry; on the other hand, the Numidian&#x27;s light cavalry horses were well-adjusted to the rough terrain and could attack and then flee back with ease. Meanwhile, Rufus had advanced to the river but was attacked by Jugurtha&#x27;s southern force; thus, the two Roman armies were incapable of coming to each other&#x27;s relief. However, although Metellus&#x27; army was now entrapped in the desert with fewer troops and inferior generalship, the Romans still prevailed simultaneously on both fronts. Rufus overpowered the southern detachment by a forward charge which scattered the war elephants and infantry of the enemy, while Metellus and Marius, rallying a group of legionaries, occupied the single hill on the plain, which commanded the situation. The Roman infantry drove back Jugurtha&#x27;s inferior Numidian soldiers, who retreated into the desert with severe losses. Metellus had won the Battle of the Muthul, but it was not a definitive victory since the Numidian king had escaped.

A fresh round of negotiations came to nothing, with Metellus rejecting Jugurtha&#x27;s heavy concessions and demanding that the king surrender himself into Roman custody. To resist the Romans more effectually, Jugurtha dismissed most of his low-quality recruits, keeping only the most active troops of infantry and light cavalry, in order to maintain the war by guerrilla tactics. Metellus advanced once again, capturing town after town, but was unable to capture his enemy. He tried to provoke Jugurtha into a pitched battle by besieging the Numidian city of Zama, but the king refused to let himself be goaded and kept up his irregular warfare. In 108 BC, when Metellus found out the location of Jugurtha&#x27;s army, he caught up with the Numidians and inflicted a serious defeat on the king. Jugurtha, with his family and treasure boxes, fled to the desert fortress of Thala, which was inaccessible except by an excruciating march of three days through the desert without water. Metellus furnished his army with skins for water transport and followed to besiege the fortress, which fell after forty days. However, Jugurtha managed to escape from the flaming wreckage, undoing all of Metellus&#x27; efforts.

At this point Jugurtha retired to the court of his father-in-law, king Bocchus I of Mauretania, who though previously professing friendship for the Romans, now received Jugurtha hospitably, and, without positively declaring war (on Rome), advanced with his troops into Numidia as far as Cirta, the capital. Metellus, who had taken up winter quarters in the area after the conclusion of the campaign, began negotiation with Bocchus to hand over Jugurtha. Before an agreement could be reached, Metellus was deposed from his command by the Roman Tribal Assembly and replaced by his lieutenant, Gaius Marius. An internal struggle in the Roman camp between Metellus and Marius led to this change of command. Metellus looked unfavourably on Marius&#x27; known ambitions in Roman politics and refused for days to allow him to sail to Rome and stand for the consulship. Eventually, Metellus permitted Marius to return to Rome and Marius was elected consul in 107. Metellus was, however, unaware that Marius still wanted to command the troops in Numidia, removing him entirely. Numidia was not an area designated to be assigned to a consul by the Roman Senate. However, the populares passed a law in its Tribal Assembly which gave the command against Jugurtha to Marius in 107. This was significant because the Assembly usurped the Senate&#x27;s rights and powers in this matter and the Senate yielded, failing to contest it.

Metellus was furious at all these developments and decided to make Marius&#x27; command a lot more difficult by refusing to let his legions serve under Marius. Metellus sent them back to Italy to join the army of the other consul, Lucius Cassius Longinus, solely to prevent them from being used in Numidia. (Lucius was about to march north to confront a Germanic invasion of Gaul.)

==Marius==

Marius found Rome&#x27;s traditional manpower reserves depleted. As inequality increased, fewer men of military age met the property requirements to serve in the legions. Yet, thousands of poor Romans, the or , sat idly in Rome, ineligible to serve. Seeking to use them, and with precedent for waiving the property requirements during the existential crisis that was the Second Punic War, Marius was exempted from the requirements. These events would inspire Marius to try to reform the Roman army.

When Gaius Marius arrived in Numidia as consul in 107 BC, he immediately ceased negotiation and resumed the war. Marius marched west plundering the Numidian countryside, seizing minor Numidian towns and fortresses trying to provoke Jugurtha into a set piece battle, but the Numidian king refused to engage. Marius&#x27; strategy was similar to Metellus&#x27; and yielded no better results; he continued the occupation of Numidian towns and he fortified several strategic positions. At the end of 107 BC Marius made a dangerous desert march to Capsa in the far south where, after the town surrendered, he executed all survivors. Next he advanced far to the west, capturing a fortress near the river Muluccha where Jugurtha had moved a large part of his treasure. Meanwhile, Jugurtha&#x27;s loyalists had recaptured Cirta. By marching so far to the west Marius had brought the Roman army very near to the dominions of king Bocchus, finally provoking the Mauretanian into direct war, joining the side of Jugurtha. In the deserts just west of Serif, Marius was taken by surprise by a massive army of Numidians and Mauretanians under command of the two enemy kings. For once, Marius was unprepared for action and in the melee all he could do was form defensive circles. The attack was pressed by Gaetulian and Mauretanian cavalries and for a time Marius and his main force found themselves besieged on a hill, while Marius&#x27;s quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla and his men were on the defensive on another hill nearby. However, the Romans managed to hold off the enemy until evening and the Africans retired, confident of finishing the job the next morning. The Romans surprised the Africans&#x27; insufficiently guarded camp the next morning at dawn and completely routed the African army. They then marched east to take Cirta again and go into winter quarters there. The African kings harried the march east with light cavalry, but were beaten back by Sulla whom Marius had put in command of the rearguard and the cavalry. The combined African army then tried to finish off Marius, but when Sulla returned from his pursuit the Romans routed both Jugurtha&#x27;s and Bocchus&#x27;s army. Marius had won the Second Battle of Cirta and could now put his army into winter quarters. Marius&#x27;s army thus finished the year&#x27;s campaigns in safety at Cirta, but it was by now evident that Rome could not defeat Jugurtha&#x27;s guerrilla tactics through war. Over the winter, therefore, Marius resumed negotiations with Bocchus, who, though he had joined in the Second Battle of Cirta, had not yet declared war on Rome itself. Ultimately, Marius reached a deal with Bocchus whereby Sulla, who was friendly with members of Bocchus&#x27; court, would enter Bocchus&#x27; camp to receive Jugurtha as a political hostage. In spite of the possibility of treachery on the Mauritanian&#x27;s part, Sulla agreed. Siding with their Roman allies, Jugurtha&#x27;s remaining followers were then treacherously massacred by the Mauritanians, and King Jugurtha was handed over in chains to Sulla by Bocchus. In the aftermath, Bocchus annexed the western part of Jugurtha&#x27;s kingdom, and was made a &quot;friend of the Roman people&quot; (a term used to describe a foreign king in good standing with Rome). Jugurtha was thrown into an underground prison (the Tullianum) in Rome, and was ultimately executed after gracing Marius&#x27;s Roman triumph in 104 BC.

==Revelations==

The Jugurthine War clearly revealed the issues with political corruption at that time and to come. The fact that a man such as Jugurtha could have his treachery, conquests, and defiances ignored simply by buying Roman military and civil officials reflected Rome&#x27;s moral and ethical decline. Romans now sought individual power often at the expense of the state. This was illustrated by Marius&#x27;s rise to power by ignoring Roman traditions. These events were also observed by Marius&#x27;s quaestor, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who later came to rival Marius in the first of the great civil wars of the Late Republican Period. The beginning of that rivalry, according to Plutarch, was purportedly Sulla&#x27;s crucial role in the negotiations for and eventual capture of Jugurtha, which led to Sulla wearing a ring portraying the capture despite Marius being awarded the victory for it.

The Roman historian Sallust wrote a monograph, &quot;Bellum Jugurthinum&quot;, on the Jugurthine War emphasising this decline of Roman ethics. He placed it, along with his work on the Catilinarian Conspiracy, in the timeline of the degeneration of Rome that began with the Fall of Carthage and ended with the Fall of the Roman Republic itself , believing this was the first of the events that set that collapse in motion. Sallust is one of the most valuable primary sources on the war, along with Plutarch&#x27;s biographies of Sulla and Marius.

<text>Gerhard Friedrich Ernst Flesch (8 October 1909 – 28 February 1948) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. After World War II, he was tried, found guilty and executed for his crimes, specifically the torture and murder of members of the Norwegian resistance movement.

==Background==
Flesch was an &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; and held the rank of SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (lieutenant colonel). He was born in Posen, Province of Posen, German Empire. Flesch became a member of NSDAP (Nazi Party) in 1933. In 1934, he obtained his law degree and by 1936 was a member of the Gestapo, when Reinhard Heydrich appointed him over a unit to control the religious sects of Germany. In 1938, Flesch took part in the German march into the Sudetenland, and in 1939, in the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. Later he was appointed political adviser to Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel in Thuringia.

==Career in World War II==
After the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, Flesch became leader of &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 2/VI in Poznań (). Between 20 and 23 October 1939, the 14 Einsatzkommando that he commanded executed 275 Poles in the Greater Poland region near Poznań who were named as Polish patriots by Wolfgang Bickerich, the Lutheran pastor in Leszno, who had kept a list before the German invasion of Poland in 1939. They included political leaders, teachers, police officers, Catholic priests, workers, and farmers, and included scouts as young as 18. This was the start of Operation Tannenberg organized by Reinhard Heydrich which was meant to eliminate Polish leaders in the parts of Poland annexed to Germany. Flesch&#x27;s men shot more than 40 more people in November 1939.

In 1940, Flesch joined the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf in their march into France. He had a position as &quot;Regierungsrat&quot; (Executive Council, government advisor), and was an SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; (major) in April 1940, when he was assigned to Norway. His first job in Norway was &quot;Kommandeur der Sipo und des SD&quot; in Bergen (the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD; Security Service) was primarily the intelligence service of the SS and the Nazi Party, where the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo; Security Police) was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. Thereafter, they became departments of the RSHA. On 11 October 1941, Flesch was appointed &quot;Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienst&quot; in Trondheim. As &quot;Kommandeur&quot; of the district, he was also chief of Falstad concentration camp outside Trondheim and the prisons in Trondheim. He was promoted to the rank of &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (lieutenant colonel) and received the title of &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot;. Flesch&#x27;s immediate superior was Heinrich Fehlis. On 8 May 1945, he fled from Trondheim with a gold bar in his luggage. He was caught and sent back with a police escort on the train and during which he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape.

==Trial and execution==
Flesch was known for being a notorious torturer, and ordered the execution of many members of the Norwegian resistance movement without any trial. After World War II, in 1946, he was tried for the many cases of torture and murder. He was charged with a series of war crimes committed in Norway; seven instances of ordering the murders of a total of 37 prisoners, albeit four of those targeted were not killed, five instances of torture (&quot;verschärfte Vernehmung&quot;: &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;) and one instance of withholding medical treatment resulting in death. Flesch was found guilty of ordering 25 murders, 21 of which were carried out, all counts of torture, and the withholding medical treatment charges. He was sentenced to death by execution by firing squad. Flesch appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway on procedural grounds and that the sentence was too harsh; however on 12 February 1948 his appeal was rejected. The sentence was carried out at midnight at Kristiansten Fortress on 28 February 1948. Right before the order was given to fire, Flesch shouted &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot;

<text>The , also known as the Devil&#x27;s triangle, the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle, the Formosa Triangle and the Pacific [[Bermuda Triangle]], is a region of the Pacific, south of Tokyo. The Devil&#x27;s Sea is sometimes considered a paranormal location, though the veracity of these claims has been questioned.

== Description ==
 The Japanese word &quot;ma no umi&quot; (translated as devil sea, troublesome sea, or dangerous sea) has been widely used to describe dangerous marine locations around the world. This means that there are many locations that the Japanese call &quot;ma no umi.&quot;

In August of 1945 a Mitsubishi A6M Zero supposedly went missing. A distress radio transmission from Zero F Wing Commander pilot Shiro Kawamoto crossing the Triangle near the end of the war created more questions than answers. The last thing his message said was &quot;...something is happening in the sky...the sky is opening up-&quot;.

On 4 January 1955, Japanese ship &quot;Shinyo Maru No. 10&quot; (第十伸洋丸) lost radio contact near Mikura-jima. Japanese newspapers then began to label the location as &quot;ma no umi&quot; until the ship was found safe on 15 January. Yomiuri Shimbun showed a map of the sea with points of several other ships that had been lost in recent years, and stated that those ships were lost within the area that the Yokohama Coast Guard Office had classified as a special danger area. 

In the U.S., &quot;The New York Times&quot; introduced this incident with the term &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Sea,&quot; where nine ships had been lost in perfect weather. Yomiuri Shimbun described the size of the &quot;ma no umi&quot; as follows: &quot;From the Izu islands to east of the Ogasawara islands; about 200 miles east to west, and about 300 miles north to south, where nine ships were lost in the past five years&quot;. However, two of the nine ships were lost near Miyake-jima and Iwo Jima, about 750 miles apart.

In 1974, American paranormal writer Charles Berlitz introduced the Devil&#x27;s Sea in his book &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;. Berlitz claimed that &quot;nine modern ships and several hundred crews were lost without traces between 1950 and 1954; in 1955, the Japanese government sent &quot;Kaiyo Maru No 5&quot; to the sea for investigating unexplained ship losses, but this ship vanished as well&quot; ... &quot;After the incident, Japanese authorities have labeled the sea as a danger zone.&quot;

In 1989, Berlitz claimed that the Devil&#x27;s Sea is also called the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle in his book &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Triangle&quot;. Berlitz continued by theorizing that five Japanese military vessels disappeared while on maneuvers near Japanese shores in early 1942.

== Criticisms ==

In 1975, American author Larry Kusche published &quot;The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved&quot;, debunking the Devil&#x27;s Sea legend. Kusche sent letters to government offices which were related to the sea, but nobody knew about the Devil&#x27;s Sea or such a danger area. The actual danger zone where the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan warned not to approach was only 10 miles to Myōjin-shō. 

The &quot;Kaiyo Maru No. 5&quot; was sent to Myōjin-shō for investigating activity of an undersea volcano, and lost in 1952. The loss of the Kaiyo Maru was accounted for: undersea volcano eruption. One of eight other lost ships also was accounted for. Most of the nine ships were small fishing boats with poor or no radio. The weather was not perfect.

In 1995, Kusche&#x27;s research claimed that Berlitz&#x27;s military vessels were actually fishing vessels, and some of those listed by Berlitz sank outside the area defined by the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle. Kusche also wrote that the Japanese research vessel carried not 100 personnel, but only 31 and that an undersea volcano destroyed it on 24 September 1952.

In Daniel Cohen&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Curses, Hexes &amp; Spells&quot;, it&#x27;s reported that legends of the danger of the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle go back for centuries in Japan. Its most famous casualty was the &quot;No. 5 Kaiyō-Maru&quot;, a scientific research vessel, which disappeared with the loss of all hands on 24 September 1952. With such a dramatic history, one would expect there to be all sorts of information on the subject, especially in Japan. A search completed by &quot;Skeptoid&quot; author Brian Dunning for books, newspaper, and magazine articles on the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle came up completely empty, until a full 20 years after the loss of the &quot;Kaiyō-Maru&quot;. Apparently, the story (even the very existence of this legendary named region) was not invented until very recently.

Research also explores natural environmental changes, as the cause of such controversial anomalies in the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle. One of these explanations is the vast field of methane hydrates present on the bottom of the ocean in the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle area. Methane clathrates (methane hydrates gas) will &quot;explode&quot; when it rises above 18 °C (64 °F). Methane hydrate gases are described as icelike deposits that break off from the bottom and rise, forming bubbles on the surface of the water. 

These gas eruptions can interrupt buoyancy and can easily sink a ship, leaving no trace of debris. Another explanation for this &quot;paranormal&quot; activity could be the undersea volcanoes that are very common in this area. It is quite characteristic for small islands in the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle to frequently disappear and new islands appear due to both volcanoes and seismic activity. Because the location of the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle is not plotted on any official world map, the area and perimeter vary from one author to another author.

<text>The information bottleneck method is a technique in information theory introduced by Naftali Tishby, Fernando C. Pereira, and William Bialek. It is designed for finding the best tradeoff between accuracy and complexity (compression) when summarizing (e.g. clustering) a random variable X, given a joint probability distribution p(X,Y) between X and an observed relevant variable Y - and self-described as providing &quot;a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning&quot;.

Applications include distributional clustering and dimension reduction, and more recently it has been suggested as a theoretical foundation for deep learning. It generalized the classical notion of minimal sufficient statistics from parametric statistics to arbitrary distributions, not necessarily of exponential form. It does so by relaxing the sufficiency condition to capture some fraction of the mutual information with the relevant variable Y.

The information bottleneck can also be viewed as a rate distortion problem, with a distortion function that measures how well Y is predicted from a compressed representation T compared to its direct prediction from X. This interpretation provides a general iterative algorithm for solving the information bottleneck trade-off and calculating the information curve from the distribution p(X,Y).

Let the compressed representation be given by random variable formula_1. The algorithm minimizes the following functional with respect to conditional distribution formula_2:

: formula_3

where formula_4 and formula_5 are the mutual information of formula_6 and formula_1, and of formula_1 and formula_9, respectively, and formula_10 is a Lagrange multiplier.

== Learning theory for deep learning ==
It has been mathematically proven that controlling information bottleneck is one way to control generalization error in deep learning. Namely, the generalization error is proven to scale as formula_11 where formula_12 is the number of training samples, formula_6 is the input to a deep neural network, and formula_1 is the output of a hidden layer. This generalization bound scale with the degree of information bottleneck, unlike the other generalization bounds that scale with the number of parameters, VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, stability or robustness.

== Phase transitions ==

== Information theory of deep learning ==

Theory of Information Bottleneck is recently used to study Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
Consider formula_15 and formula_16 respectively as the input and output layers of a DNN, and let formula_17 be any hidden layer of the network. 
Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby proposed the information bottleneck that expresses the tradeoff between the mutual information measures formula_18 and formula_19. In this case, formula_18 and formula_21 respectively quantify the amount of information that the hidden layer contains about the input and the output.
They conjectured that the training process of a DNN consists of two separate phases; 1) an initial fitting phase in which formula_19 increases, and 2) a subsequent compression phase in which formula_18 decreases. Saxe et al. in countered the claim of Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby, stating that this compression phenomenon in DNNs is not comprehensive, and it depends on the particular activation function. In particular, they claimed that the compression does not happen with ReLu activation functions. Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby disputed these claims, arguing that Saxe et al. had not observed compression due to weak estimates of the mutual information. Recently, Noshad et al. used a rate-optimal estimator of mutual information to explore this controversy, observing that the optimal hash-based estimator reveals the compression phenomenon in a wider range of networks with ReLu and maxpooling activations. On the other hand, recently Goldfeld et al. have argued that the observed compression is a result of geometric, and not of information-theoretic phenomena, a view that has been shared also in.

== Variational bottleneck ==

== Gaussian bottleneck ==

The Gaussian bottleneck, namely, applying the information bottleneck approach to Gaussian variables, leads to solutions related to canonical correlation analysis. Assume formula_24 are jointly multivariate zero mean normal vectors with covariances formula_25 and formula_26 is a compressed version of formula_27 that must maintain a given value of mutual information with formula_28. It can be shown that the optimum formula_26 is a normal vector consisting of linear combinations of the elements of formula_30 where matrix formula_31 has orthogonal rows. 
The projection matrix formula_32 in fact contains formula_33 rows selected from the weighted left eigenvectors of the singular value decomposition of the matrix (generally asymmetric)

: formula_34

Define the singular value decomposition

: formula_35

and the critical values

: formula_36

then the number formula_37 of active eigenvectors in the projection, or order of approximation, is given by

: formula_38

And we finally get

: formula_39

In which the weights are given by

: formula_40

where formula_41

Applying the Gaussian information bottleneck to time series (processes), yields solutions related to optimal predictive coding. This procedure is formally equivalent to linear Slow Feature Analysis.

Optimal temporal structures in linear dynamic systems can be revealed in the so-called past-future information bottleneck, an application of the bottleneck method to non-Gaussian sampled data. The concept, as treated by Creutzig, Tishby et al., is not without complication as two independent phases make up in the exercise: firstly estimation of the unknown parent probability densities from which the data samples are drawn and secondly the use of these densities within the information theoretic framework of the bottleneck.

=== Density estimation ===

Since the bottleneck method is framed in probabilistic rather than statistical terms, the underlying probability density at the sample points formula_42must be estimated. This is a well known problem with multiple solutions described by Silverman. In the present method, joint sample probabilities are found by use of a Markov transition matrix method and this has some mathematical synergy with the bottleneck method itself.

The arbitrarily increasing distance metric formula_43 between all sample pairs and distance matrix is formula_44 . Then transition probabilities between sample pairs formula_45 for some formula_46must be computed. Treating samples as states, and a normalised version of formula_47 as a Markov state transition probability matrix, the vector of probabilities of the &#x27;states&#x27; after formula_48 steps, conditioned on the initial state formula_49, is formula_50. The equilibrium probability vector formula_51 given, in the usual way, by the dominant eigenvector of matrix formula_47 which is independent of the initialising vector formula_49. This Markov transition method establishes a probability at the sample points which is claimed to be proportional to the probabilities&#x27; densities there.

Other interpretations of the use of the eigenvalues of distance matrix formula_54 are discussed in Silverman&#x27;s &quot;Density Estimation for Statistics and Data Analysis&quot;.

=== Clusters ===
In the following soft clustering example, the reference vector formula_55 contains sample categories and the joint probability formula_56 is assumed known. A soft cluster formula_57 is defined by its probability distribution over the data samples formula_58. Tishby et al. presented the following iterative set of equations to determine the clusters which are ultimately a generalization of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, developed in rate distortion theory. The application of this type of algorithm in neural networks appears to originate in entropy arguments arising in the application of Gibbs Distributions in deterministic annealing.

: formula_59

The function of each line of the iteration expands as

Line 1: This is a matrix valued set of conditional probabilities

: formula_60

The Kullback–Leibler divergence formula_61 between the formula_55 vectors generated by the sample data formula_63 and those generated by its reduced information proxy formula_64 is applied to assess the fidelity of the compressed vector with respect to the reference (or categorical) data formula_55 in accordance with the fundamental bottleneck equation. formula_66 is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between distributions formula_67

: formula_68

and formula_69 is a scalar normalization. The weighting by the negative exponent of the distance means that prior cluster probabilities are downweighted in line 1 when the Kullback–Leibler divergence is large, thus successful clusters grow in probability while unsuccessful ones decay.

Line 2: Second matrix-valued set of conditional probabilities. By definition

: formula_70
where the Bayes identities formula_71 are used.

Line 3: this line finds the marginal distribution of the clusters formula_64

: formula_73

This is a standard result.

Further inputs to the algorithm are the marginal sample distribution formula_74 which has already been determined by the dominant eigenvector of formula_47 and the matrix valued Kullback–Leibler divergence function

: formula_76

derived from the sample spacings and transition probabilities.

The matrix formula_77 can be initialized randomly or with a reasonable guess, while matrix formula_78 needs no prior values. Although the algorithm converges, multiple minima may exist that would need to be resolved.

==Defining decision contours ==

To categorize a new sample formula_79 external to the training set formula_80, the previous distance metric finds the transition probabilities between formula_79 and all samples in formula_82, formula_83 with formula_84 a normalization. Secondly apply the last two lines of the 3-line algorithm to get cluster and conditional category probabilities.

: formula_85

Finally

: formula_86

Parameter formula_87 must be kept under close supervision since, as it is increased from zero, increasing numbers of features, in the category probability space, snap into focus at certain critical thresholds.

=== An example ===
The following case examines clustering in a four quadrant multiplier with random inputs formula_88 and two categories of output, formula_89, generated by formula_90. This function has two spatially separated clusters for each category and so demonstrates that the method can handle such distributions.

20 samples are taken, uniformly distributed on the square formula_91 . The number of clusters used beyond the number of categories, two in this case, has little effect on performance and the results are shown for two clusters using parameters formula_92.

The distance function is formula_93 where formula_94 while the conditional distribution formula_95 is a 2 × 20 matrix

: formula_96

and zero elsewhere.

The summation in line 2 incorporates only two values representing the training values of +1 or −1, but nevertheless works well. The figure shows the locations of the twenty samples with &#x27;0&#x27; representing &quot;Y&quot; = 1 and &#x27;x&#x27; representing &quot;Y&quot; = −1. The contour at the unity likelihood ratio level is shown,

: formula_97

as a new sample formula_98is scanned over the square. Theoretically the contour should align with the formula_99 and formula_100 coordinates but for such small sample numbers they have instead followed the spurious clusterings of the sample points.
===Neural network/fuzzy logic analogies===
This algorithm is somewhat analogous to a neural network with a single hidden layer. The internal nodes are represented by the clusters formula_101 and the first and second layers of network weights are the conditional probabilities formula_102 and formula_103 respectively. However, unlike a standard neural network, the algorithm relies entirely on probabilities as inputs rather than the sample values themselves, while internal and output values are all conditional probability density distributions. Nonlinear functions are encapsulated in distance metric formula_104 (or &quot;influence functions/radial basis functions&quot;) and transition probabilities instead of sigmoid functions.

The Blahut-Arimoto three-line algorithm converges rapidly, often in tens of iterations, and by varying formula_87, formula_106 and formula_43 and the cardinality of the clusters, various levels of focus on features can be achieved.

The statistical soft clustering definition formula_78 has some overlap with the verbal fuzzy membership concept of fuzzy logic.

==Extensions==
An interesting extension is the case of information bottleneck with side information. Here information is maximized about one target variable and minimized about another, learning a representation that is informative about selected aspects of data. Formally

<text>21 Lutetia is a large M-type asteroid in the main asteroid belt. It measures about 100 kilometers in diameter (120 km along its major axis). It was discovered in 1852 by Hermann Goldschmidt, and is named after Lutetia, the Latin name of Paris.

Lutetia has an irregular shape and is heavily cratered, with the largest impact crater reaching 45 km in diameter. The surface is geologically heterogeneous and is intersected by a system of grooves and scarps, which are thought to be fractures. It has a high overall bulk density, suggesting that it is made of metal-rich rock.

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; probe passed within of Lutetia in July 2010. It was the largest asteroid visited by a spacecraft until &quot;Dawn&quot; arrived at Vesta in July 2011.

==Discovery and exploration==

Lutetia was discovered on 15 November 1852, by Hermann Goldschmidt from the balcony of his apartment in Paris. A preliminary orbit for the asteroid was computed in November–December 1852 by German astronomer Georg Rümker and others. In 1903, it was photographed at opposition by Edward Pickering at Harvard College Observatory. He computed an opposition
magnitude of 10.8.

There have been two reported stellar occultations by Lutetia, observed from Malta in 1997 and Australia in 2003, with only one chord each, roughly agreeing with IRAS measurements.

On 10 July 2010, the European &quot;Rosetta&quot; space probe flew by Lutetia at a minimum distance of km at a velocity of 15 kilometres per second on its way to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The flyby provided images of up to 60 meters per pixel resolution and covered about 50% of the surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The 462 images were obtained in 21 narrow- and broad-band filters extending from 0.24 to 1 μm. Lutetia was also observed by the visible–near-infrared imaging spectrometer VIRTIS, and measurements of the magnetic field and plasma environment were taken as well.

==Characteristics==
===Orbit===
Lutetia orbits the Sun at the distance of approximately 2.4 AU in the inner asteroid belt. Its orbit lies almost in the plane of ecliptic and is moderately eccentric. The orbital period of Lutetia is 3.8 years.

===Mass and density===
The &quot;Rosetta&quot; flyby demonstrated that the mass of Lutetia is (1.700 ± 0.017) kg, smaller than the pre-flyby estimate of 2.57 kg. It has one of the highest densities seen in asteroids at 3.4 ± 0.3 g/cm3. Taking into account possible porosity of 10–15%, the bulk density of Lutetia exceeds that of a typical stony meteorite.

===Composition===
Lutetia is classified among the enigmatic M-type asteroids, most of which were historically believed to be nearly purely metallic. However, radar observations of the M-types suggest that two-thirds of them, including Lutetia, may instead consist of metal-enriched silicates. Indeed, telescopic spectra of Lutetia have shown a flat, low frequency spectrum similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites and C-type asteroids and unlike metallic meteorites, evidence of hydrated minerals, abundant silicates, and a thicker regolith than most asteroids.

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; probe found that the asteroid has a moderately red spectrum in visible light and an essentially flat spectrum in the near infrared. No absorption features were detected in the range covered by observations, 0.4–3.5 μm, which is at odds with previous ground-based reports of hydrated minerals and carbon-rich compounds. There was also no evidence of olivine. However, the spacecraft only observed half of Lutetia, so the existence of these phases cannot be completely ruled out. Together with the high bulk density reported for Lutetia, these results suggest that Lutetia is either made of enstatite chondrite material, or may be related to metal-rich and water-poor carbonaceous chondrite of classes like CB, CH, or CR.

&quot;Rosetta&quot; observations revealed that the surface of Lutetia is covered with a regolith made of loosely aggregated dust particles 50–100 μm in size. It is estimated to be 3 km thick and may be responsible for the softened outlines of many of the larger craters.

===Shape and axial tilt===
The &quot;Rosetta&quot; probe&#x27;s photographs confirmed the results of a 2003 lightcurve analysis that described Lutetia as a rough sphere with &quot;sharp and irregular shape features&quot;. A study from 2004–2009 proposed that Lutetia has a non-convex shape, likely because of a large crater, Suspicio Crater. It is not yet clear whether &quot;Rosetta&quot;&#x27;s findings support this claim.

The analysis of &quot;Rosetta&quot; images in combination with photometric light curves yielded the position of the north rotational pole of Lutetia: , . This gives an axial tilt of 96° (retrograde rotator), meaning that the axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the ecliptic, similar to the planet Uranus.

==Surface features==

The surface of Lutetia is covered by numerous impact craters and intersected by fractures, scarps and grooves thought to be surface manifestations of internal fractures. On the imaged hemisphere of the asteroid there are a total of 350 craters with diameters ranging from 600 m to 55 km. The most heavily cratered surfaces (in Achaia region) have a crater retention age of about 3.6 ± 0.1 billion years.

The surface of Lutetia has been divided into seven regions based on their geology. They are Baetica (Bt), Achaia (AC), Etruria (Et), Narbonensis (Nb), Noricum (Nr), Pannonia (Pa), and Raetia (Ra). The Baetica region is situated around the north pole (in the center of the image) and includes a cluster of impact craters 21 km in diameter as well as their impact deposits. It is the youngest surface unit on Lutetia. Baetica is covered by a smooth ejecta blanket approximately 600 m thick that has partially buried older craters. Other surface features include landslides, gravitational taluses and ejecta blocks up to 300 m in size. The landslides and corresponding rock outcrops are correlated with variations of albedo, being generally brighter.

The two oldest regions are Achaia and Noricum. The former is a remarkably flat area with a lot of impact craters. The Narbonensis region coincides with the largest impact crater on Lutetia—Massilia. It includes a number of smaller units and is modified by pit chains and grooves formed at a later epoch. Other two regions—Pannonia and Raetia are also likely to be large impact craters. The last Noricum region is intersected by a prominent groove 10 km in length and about 100 m deep.

The numerical simulations showed that even the impact that produced the largest crater on Lutetia, which is 45 km in diameter, seriously fractured but did not shatter the asteroid. So, Lutetia has likely survived intact from the beginning of the Solar System. The existence of linear fractures and the impact crater morphology also indicate that the interior of this asteroid has a considerable strength and is not a rubble pile like many smaller asteroids. Taken together, these facts suggest that Lutetia should be classified as a primordial planetesimal.

===Suspicio Crater===
Studies of patterns of fractures on Lutetia lead astronomers to think that there is a ~45 kilometer impact crater on the southern side of Lutetia, named Suspicio Crater, but because &quot;Rosetta&quot; only observed Lutetia&#x27;s northern part, it is not known for certain what it looks like, or if it exists at all.

==Nomenclature==
In March, 2011, the Working Group for Planetary Nomenclature at the International Astronomical Union agreed on a naming scheme for geographical features on Lutetia. Since Lutetia was a Roman city, the asteroid&#x27;s craters are named after cities of the Roman Empire and the adjacent parts of Europe during the time of Lutetia&#x27;s existence. Its regions are named after the discoverer of Lutetia (Goldschmidt) and after provinces of the Roman Empire at the time of Lutetia. Other features are named after rivers of the Roman Empire and the adjacent parts of Europe at the time of the city.

==Origin==

The composition of Lutetia suggests that it formed in the inner Solar System, among the terrestrial planets, and was ejected into the asteroid belt through an interaction with one of them.

<text>Beni Ḥassan ( &quot;sons of Ḥassān&quot;) is a Bedouin Arab tribe which inhabits Western Sahara, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. It is one of the four sub-tribes of the Banu Maqil who emigrated in the 11th century from South Arabia to the Maghreb with the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes. In the 13th century, they took the Sanhaja territories in the southwest of the Sahara. In Morocco, they first settled, alongside their Maqil relatives, in the area between Tadla and the Moulouya River. The Sous Almohad governor called upon them for help against a rebellion in the Sous, and they resettled in and around that region. They later moved to what is today Mauritania, and from the 16th century onwards, they managed to push back all black peoples southwards to the Senegal Valley river. The Beni Hassan and other warrior Arab tribes dominated the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the area after the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. As a result, Arabs became the dominant ethnic group in Western Sahara and Mauretania. The Bani Hassan dialect of Arabic became used in the region and is still spoken, in the form of Hassaniya Arabic. The hierarchy established by the Beni Hassan tribe gave Mauritania much of its sociological character. That ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in Mauritania.

== Origin ==
Beni Hassan are one of the four sub-tribes of Beni Maqil who emigrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century. The exact origin of the Beni Maqil tribe is unknown, although it has been established that they most likely originated in South Arabia (Yemen). The Maqil claimed Hashemite descent from Ja&#x27;far ibn Abi Talib, while some Arabian genealogists categorized them as Hilalians. Ibn Khaldun said both of these versions are false and that Maqil is most likely an Arab nomadic group from Yemen.

The tradition of Beni Hassan states that they were descendants of Hasan ibn Ali, son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law and a leading figure in Shia Islam, although the Beni Hassan were Sunni Muslims. The Sahrawi nation includes the Beni Hassan as part of its founding peoples and Hassaniya Arabic as part of its national identity. There is also a Beni Hassan Bedouin tribe in northern Jordan.
Beni Hassan&#x27;s descendants and other tribes that arrived from Yemen in the 13th century are considered among the clean-blooded Arab tribes. For example, the Oulad Delim who trace their origin back to Beni Hassan are the most populous tribe in Western Sahara and consider themselves the cleanest blooded Arabs in the Sahel. 

== History ==
=== Migration to the Maghreb ===
Various sources point to the Maqil tribe as the origin from which the Beni Hassan tribe was formed. The Ma&#x27;qils entered the Maghreb during the wave of emigration of the Arabian tribes in the 11th century, and since then, they were situated in North Africa together with other Bedouin Arab tribes that migrated from the Arabian Peninsula such as the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym, with whom they shared great skill as warriors and a destructive capacity for the nations they attacked.

The Bedouin tribes were sent into the Maghreb by the Fatimids to punish the Zirids for switching allegiance to the rival Abbasid Caliphate. They were compared to Mughal warriors centuries later. They adapted perfectly to the climatic desert conditions of the Maghreb, discovering the same way of life as in the Arabian Peninsula. The Banu Sulaym opposed the Maqil&#x27;s arrival and fought them off. The Maqil later allied with the Banu Hilal and entered under their protection, which enabled them to wander in the Moroccan desert between the Moulouya River and Tafilalt oases.

In the 13th century, they occupied southern Algeria and dominated the oases of Tuat and Gourara. For some authors, at this point, the Maqil group had already disintegrated into different populations in the Maghreb and had given rise to the Beni Hassan along with other related groups.

=== Conquest of the Sanhaja ===
The Beni Hassan continued their expansion to the southwest and occupied Sanhaja lands in the 13th century after invading and defeating this Berber confederation with the Lamtuna, Masmuda, Djuddala, Gazula, Banu Warith, Lamta and Tuareg, in a group known as the Baranis in Western Sahara.

The Sanhaja has long had to pay tribute to the nomadic Bedouin Hassani invaders. The invasion was quick and effective and happened around the year 1250, by the end of the Almohad Caliphate, and also dominated the valleys of the Moulouya, Draa, Sous, as well as the Tafilalt oasis region.

=== Migration to Morocco ===

By the mid-15th century, the Beni Hassan controlled a large part of the oases and Western Sahara. They crossed into the Atlas after taking advantage of the weakening Marinid Sultanate around 1460 and then they dominated the Haouz region of Marrakesh by the beginning of the 16th century. At the same time, a part of the Beni Hassan made its way to Mauritania. Other groups migrated north through Tafilalt to Fez or up the Sebou and Bou Regreg rivers, where some settled south of Rabat.

The Hassanis were represented in the Haouz of Marrakech by the Rahamna, who were brought north to respond to the military needs of the Saadian Sultanate in the early 16th century. Two of the prominent Hassani communities during the late &#x27;Alawi period were the Jaysh al-Udaya and the Shabbanat. The former were invited by the sultan of Morocco Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), while the latter controlled Marrakesh when sultan Al-Rashid arrived to conquer it.

=== Char Bouba War ===
Historical accounts report that these Hassani communities enriched themselves by collecting tolls from trade caravans and extorting farming and herding villages settled in the oases. They were accused of subjecting these territories to two centuries of looting and intermittent wars, but at the same time they point out that their families settled in the same towns that they attacked and subjugated. This took place during the Char Bouba War from 1644 to 1674, which after decades of confrontations ended up completely Arabizing the native Berber population, destroying their language and culture and giving rise to the contemporary Sahrawi people.

The Char Bouba War was led by Sidi Ibrahim Al Aroussi, son of the famous Cheikh Sidi Ahmed Al Aroussi (died in 1593, near to Smara, in Western Sahara). Al Aroussi, with his two sons Shanan Al Aroussi and Sidi Tounsi Al Aroussi, led a powerful force of the Beni Hassan, the Aroussi Army, to conquer the Berber Imarat in modern day Mauritania and gain access to Bilad as-Sudan (&quot;the Land of the Blacks&quot;, in Senegal and Mali).

In 1673, Nasr al-Din began invaded Futa Tooro and the various Wolof states beyond the Senegal river. By focusing on the states south of the Senegal, Nasr al-Din avoided an early confrontation with the powerful Beni Hassan. Nasr al-Din&#x27;s focus on these states gained him control of the entrepôts for the gum trade along the Senegal. French trade on the Senegal had seen large growth since the beginning of the century, and thus control of the entrepôts strengthened Nasr al-Din financially, whilst offsetting the Hassan control of the trade to the ports on the Saharan coast.

The Beni Hassan were united in their opposition to Nasr al-Din. Most of the burden of fighting fell to the Emirate of Trarza, although the Emirate of Brakna sent Trarza reinforcements and helped immobilise Zawaya in their own regions to prevent them from joining the forces of Nasr. Most Zawaya of the Southern Sahara sided with Nasr, although some remained neutral, and others supported the Beni Hassan, with a Zawaya scholar from Shinqit issuing a fatwa against Nasr, stating that he was not a Caliph and had no right to impose the zakat. This fatwa led to Hãdi, the Trarza chief, sending troops to seize animals that had already been sent as zakat.

In 1674, the Beni Hassan defeated the Marabout Berbers, and after achieving political and military hegemony in the area, they founded the emirates of Trarza, Brakna, Tagant, Adrar and Hodh. The marabouts were Berbers who followed the Islamic doctrine of Nasr al-Din imposed in Senegal in the mid-17th century. The war ended in defeat for the Berber tribes, and they were from that point on forced to surrender their arms and submit to the warrior Arab tribes, to whom they paid the horma tributary tax. They would remain in roles as either exploited semi-sedentary agriculturalists and fishermen (znaga tribes), or, higher up on the social ladder, as religious (marabout or zawiya) tribes. This division between Hassane Arab warriors and Berber marabouts, plus the subordinate znaga, existed in Mauritania up until the French colonization, when France imposed itself militarily on all tribes, and so broke the power of the Hassane. Still, the traditional roles of the tribes remain important socially in these areas. 

=== Before French colonization ===
Following the pre-Islamic tradition of tribal warfare between clans in the Arabian Peninsula, the new Hassani emirates repeatedly went to war with each other. Throughout the 18th century, they harassed the Wolof in Senegal. Throughout this period, they spread their dialect and culture throughout the desert area of Western Sahara. In the 19th century, they led the consolidation of the process of cultural and linguistic Arabization of Mauritania. By the end of the 19th century, the Zenaga Berber language was completely annihilated. 

== Beni Hassan sub-tribes ==
*The descendants of Hassan ben Mokhtar ben Mohamed, son of the forefather of the Maqils
*The Shebanat: descendants of Shebana, brother of Hassan, and son of Mokhtar ben Mohamed
*The Reguitat: descendants of Jallal, Salem and Uthman, brothers of Mokhtar and sons of Mohamed

Several other Arab tribes joined the Maqils and became part of the Beni Hassan tribe.

<text>Joseph Patrick Kinnear (27 December 1946 – 7 April 2024) was an Irish professional football manager and player. As a defender, Kinnear spent the majority of his career spanning ten seasons with Tottenham Hotspur and one with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. With Tottenham he won the FA Cup, the League Cup twice, the Charity Shield, and the UEFA Cup. After Spurs, Kinnear played for Brighton for the 1975–76 season. Having been born in Dublin, Kinnear played and was capped 26 times for the Republic of Ireland national team. After his playing career, he managed India, Nepal, Doncaster Rovers, Wimbledon, Luton Town, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle United.

==Early life==
Kinnear moved to England at the age of eight. His father died when Kinnear was young and his mother brought up five children on a council estate in Watford. Kinnear captained his school and the Hertfordshire team and was noticed by St Albans City.

==Club career==
Kinnear made an impression as a player with St Albans City. His talent as a defender was recognised and, in 1963, aged 17, he moved to Tottenham Hotspur as an amateur footballer. Learning his footballing skills under the managership of Bill Nicholson, Kinnear made his Tottenham debut on 8 April 1966 in a 4–1 home defeat by West Ham United. Kinnear had just played his first international game and three days later, in February 1967, Phil Beal broke his arm, which put him out of the rest of the season. This allowed Kinnear to play more regular football for Tottenham in the right back position and, by the end of the season, he went on to play in the 1967 FA Cup final, beating Chelsea, a game Tottenham won 2–1. Kinnear made almost 200 league appearances for Tottenham, scoring two league goals. He won four major honours during his time at the club: the FA Cup in 1967; the UEFA Cup in 1972 and the Football League Cup on two occasions (in 1971 and 1973). In 1975, he moved to Brighton, where he made 16 appearances before retiring aged 30.

==International career==
Kinnear was capped 26 times by the Republic of Ireland, scoring no goals. His debut came in the 2–1 defeat by Turkey on 22 February 1967.

==Managerial career==

===Asia===
After his retirement from football in 1977, Kinnear spent five years in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates managing Sharjah and Al-Shabab (alongside Dave Mackay), also spending time coaching in Malaysia. He spent three months coaching India and one year coaching Nepal, later returning to England to assist Mackay at Doncaster Rovers.

===Wimbledon===
Kinnear briefly took charge of Doncaster after Mackay&#x27;s departure in 1989, but was replaced by Billy Bremner after a consortium completed their takeover of the club. Kinnear was appointed reserve team manager of Wimbledon later that year before being appointed manager at the club following Peter Withe&#x27;s dismissal in January 1992. Kinnear led the Dons to a 6th-place finish in the Premier League in the 1993–94 season. He was voted Premier League Manager of the Month three times by the end of the season as Wimbledon finished above more established teams including Liverpool, Aston Villa, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.

The next season Kinnear continued to defy the odds and Wimbledon finished 9th in the league.

It was reported that Kinnear turned down the chance to replace Jack Charlton as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team in 1996 because the FAI did not offer him enough money. Kinnear then guided Wimbledon to semi-finals in both of the major domestic cup competitions in 1997 as well as finishing 8th in the Premier League. When Wimbledon were taken over by new Norwegian owners after the end of that season, it was widely reported that Kinnear would be axed as manager in favour of Norwegian coach Åge Hareide, but no change happened and Kinnear remained as manager for a further two seasons.

Kinnear continued in his role as Wimbledon until he suffered a heart attack before a league game against Sheffield Wednesday in March 1999. He stood down in June of that year and was replaced at Wimbledon by Egil Olsen. Wimbledon were relegated from the Premier League the following season.

===Luton Town===
Before returning to football management with Luton Town, Kinnear was a front runner to replace Martin O&#x27;Neill at Leicester City, and also considered taking over the struggling Sheffield Wednesday. Instead, Kinnear would be briefly involved as director of football at Oxford United during the 2000–01 season. In January 2001, he resigned, reportedly because of poor health. Kinnear&#x27;s lack of input at Oxford was seen as the real reason behind his move away. Just a few weeks later he was handed a similar role at Luton Town, who were battling against relegation from what was then the Second Division, as were Oxford. On arrival, Kinnear demoted then-manager Lil Fuccillo and appointed himself manager of the team.

He could not save the club from relegation, despite purchasing striker Steve Howard for £50,000 on transfer deadline day. In the summer of 2001, Kinnear released the majority of the relegated squad, and brought in a number of his own men over the course of the season, including future captains Kevin Nicholls and Chris Coyne, along with winger Jean-Louis Valois. The team stormed to promotion under Kinnear&#x27;s guidance, finishing runners-up to Plymouth Argyle in the Hatters&#x27; first promotion in 20 years.

The next season was disappointing for the Hatters, as they were expected to compete for promotion, but in the end they only managed a 9th-place finish. In May 2003 the club was sold to a consortium, led by John Gurney, which led to Kinnear and his assistant Mick Harford being sacked in mysterious circumstances, citing a Northampton Town employee&#x27;s signature on the letters which confirmed the dismissal.

===Nottingham Forest===
Kinnear was out of work until Nottingham Forest offered him the manager&#x27;s job in February 2004, taking over from Paul Hart. Forest were in the bottom third of the league table when he took over, but he would have an immediate impact on the club. Kinnear was able to get the club up to 14th position by the end of the 2003–04 season. The following season began with talk of promotion, but would go badly for Forest and Kinnear, with just four wins from the first 23 games in the league that year. A 3–0 defeat by rivals Derby County at Pride Park, signalled the end for Kinnear, with his resignation coming on 16 December 2004. Nottingham Forest were 22nd in the Championship table following Kinnear&#x27;s departure, the club appointed Mick Harford to take over as interim manager. Forest would ultimately be relegated at the end of the season, after Gary Megson had been appointed as the full-time replacement to Kinnear.

===Newcastle United (2008–09)===
Kinnear was without a club following his departure from Nottingham Forest for almost four years and had not been involved in the top flight since 1999, there were rumours about joining several clubs during this time including QPR. On 26 September 2008, Kinnear was named as the interim manager of Premier League side Newcastle United until the end of October, following the shock resignation of Kevin Keegan who had publicly berated the owners and directors of the club, suggesting corruption and lack of clarity over who was in charge of the squad. The initial one-month period was extended for an additional month, keeping Kinnear at St James&#x27; Park until the end of December.

On 2 October 2008, Kinnear launched a verbal tirade at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; journalist Simon Bird, calling him a &quot;cunt&quot;.
He swore over 50 times in the first five minutes of the interview. The club&#x27;s press officer tried to order the assembled journalists not to publish any extracts from the tirade, but Kinnear himself gave the journalists permission to write up whatever they wanted from his remarks. Later in the interview, he announced that he would no longer deal with the national media while he was Newcastle manager, and that he would only speak to local newspapers from then on, with first team coach Chris Hughton handling all other interviews. Following the rant, Kinnear was nicknamed &#x27;JFK&#x27; as in Joe &#x27;Fucking&#x27; Kinnear.

Kinnear&#x27;s first two games in charge, against Everton and Manchester City, both ended as 2–2 draws. Kinnear&#x27;s first win at Newcastle was against West Bromwich Albion. Newcastle won the match 2–1, with the first goal coming from Joey Barton, who was making his first starting appearance for Newcastle since being released from prison during the summer. He then followed this up with a surprise win against fifth-placed Aston Villa to lift Newcastle off the foot of the table and out of the relegation zone. Two goals from Obafemi Martins secured the 2–0 victory.

On 31 October 2008, Kinnear stated that 22 November would be &quot;D–Day&quot; with regards to the sale of Newcastle United and his position as manager. This turned out to be untrue, as Kinnear was confirmed as being in charge for another month after Newcastle&#x27;s 0–0 draw with Chelsea. On 28 November, Kinnear was named as the permanent manager of Newcastle until the end of the 2008–09 season.

Kinnear continued his event-filled season in charge by getting sent off on 6 December after a confrontation with referee Mike Riley during a 2–2 draw with Stoke City, having been up by two goals for most of the match. After that disappointing draw with Stoke, they followed with wins against Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur, which was Newcastle&#x27;s fifth consecutive league victory against the North London team.

Following a 5–1 defeat by Liverpool on 28 December, Kinnear re-affirmed his belief that the Newcastle squad lacked strength in depth – with the manager having fielded a makeshift side due to injuries and suspensions resulting from the 2–1 Boxing Day defeat by Wigan Athletic – and stated that he was looking to improve the side with transfers in the January window. In January, Kinnear secured the signings of Peter Løvenkrands, Kevin Nolan and Ryan Taylor. The latter had been signed in a part exchanged deal with Charles N&#x27;Zogbia. N&#x27;Zogbia had frequently stated in the press, via his agent, that he wished to leave after Kinnear mispronounced his name during an interview in which he called him &quot;insomnia&quot;. He also stated that he would not consider a return to Newcastle as long as Kinnear was the manager. Shay Given was also sold to Manchester City for £7m.

On 7 February 2009, Kinnear was taken to hospital after feeling ill, hours before Newcastle&#x27;s away game against West Brom. The club stated that it was just precautionary and that Chris Hughton would take charge of the team. Newcastle won 3–2, their first win since Christmas. It was later announced Kinnear would require a heart bypass operation and that Alan Shearer would take over the managerial role for the remainder of the season. Joe Kinnear&#x27;s contract officially expired at Newcastle on 30 May 2009.

===Director of Football at Newcastle United (2013–2014)===
On 16 June 2013, in a series of telephone interviews Kinnear claimed he had been appointed as director of football for Newcastle United. In a Talksport interview over the telephone on 17 June 2013, Kinnear stated he had replaced &quot;Derek Lambesi&quot; (mispronouncing the name of Derek Llambias) as the club&#x27;s director of football, had signed Dean Holdsworth at Wimbledon for £50,000 (actually £650,000), sold Robbie Earle (who retired a year after Kinnear left), signed goalkeeper Tim Krul when he was previously manager (Krul was actually signed by Graeme Souness three years prior) and had been awarded the LMA Manager of the Year award three times despite only winning the award once. He also incorrectly stated he had never been previously sacked. Kinnear claimed to have signed John Hartson on a free when he in fact paid £7.5 million for the striker. He also mispronounced the names of Yohan Cabaye, Hatem Ben Arfa, Shola Ameobi and others in the Talksport interview. The appointment, a three-year contract, was confirmed by Newcastle United on 18 June. The confusion around Kinnear&#x27;s appointment to the role was criticised by former club chairman Freddy Shepherd in an interview with BBC Sport. Kinnear drew criticism when the 2013 summer transfer window closed with Kinnear failing to make a single permanent signing, lone recruit Loïc Rémy having been signed on loan from Queens Park Rangers. This criticism intensified at the end of the 2014 winter transfer window with Kinnear failing again to make a permanent signing, this after the £20 million sale of midfielder Yohan Cabaye, with Luuk de Jong having been brought in on loan from Borussia Mönchengladbach.

On 3 February 2014, Kinnear resigned from his position of director of football at Newcastle.

==Personal life and death==
In 2021, it was announced that since 2015 Kinnear had been living with vascular dementia. He died from complications of the disease on 7 April 2024, at the age of 77.
After his death, his family donated his brain to a study researching a possible link between dementia and having a career in professional football. It was confirmed that Kinnear had chronic traumatic encephalopathy which had led to his dementia and eventual death.

<text>James Hoban (1755 – December 8, 1831) was an Irish-American architect, best known for designing the White House.

==Early life and education==

Hoban was a Roman Catholic raised on the Desart Court estate belonging to the Earl of Desart in County Kilkenny, Ireland. He worked there as a wheelwright and carpenter until in 1779, when he was given an advanced student place in the Dublin Society&#x27;s Drawing School on Lower Grafton Street in Dublin and studied under Thomas Ivory. He excelled in his studies and received the prestigious Duke of Leinster&#x27;s medal from the Dublin Society in November 1780 for his drawing, &quot;Brackets, Stairs, and Roofs&quot;. Hoban was an apprentice to Ivory from 1779 until he left to go to America, likely in 1785.

Hoban arrived in South Carolina by April 1787, where he designed numerous buildings including the Charleston County Courthouse, which was built between 1790 and 1792 on the ruins of the former South Carolina Statehouse, which was built in 1753 and burned down in 1788.

==Career==

Following the American Revolutionary War, Hoban emigrated to the United States, and established himself as an architect in Philadelphia in 1785. President George Washington admired Hoban&#x27;s work on his Southern Tour. Washington met with Hoban in Charleston in May 1791, and summoned the architect to Philadelphia, then the nation&#x27;s capital, in June 1792.

In July 1792, Hoban was named winner of the design competition for the White House. His initial design resembled the Charlestown Courthouse with a three-story facade and nine bays across. Under Washington&#x27;s influence, Hoban amended it to a two-story facade, 11 bays across, and, at Washington&#x27;s insistence, the whole presidential mansion was faced with stone. It is unclear whether any of Hoban&#x27;s surviving drawings are actually from the competition.

Hoban owned at least three slaves who were employed as carpenters in the construction of the White House. Their names are recorded as &quot;Ben, Daniel, and Peter&quot; and appear on a Hoban payroll.

Hoban was also one of the supervising architects who worked on the U.S. Capitol, which was designed by William Thornton, and oversaw the architecture of The Octagon House. Hoban lived the rest of his life in Washington, D.C., where he worked on public buildings and government projects, including roads and bridges.

Hoban was a Freemason.

Hoban also is believed to have designed Rossenarra House near Kilmoganny in Ireland in 1824.

Hoban&#x27;s wife, Susanna Sewall, was the sister of the prominent Georgetown City Tavern proprietor, Clement Sewall, who enlisted as a sergeant at age 19 in the Maryland Line during the Revolutionary War, was promoted six months later to ensign and then severely wounded at the Battle of Germantown.

After Washington, D.C. was granted limited home rule in 1802, Hoban served on the 12-member city council for most of the remainder of his life, except during the years he was rebuilding the White House. Hoban was also involved in the development of Catholic institutions in the city, including Georgetown University, where his son was a member of the Jesuit community, St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish, and the Georgetown Visitation Monastery founded by Teresa Lalor of Ballyragget.

==Death==

Hoban died in Washington, D.C., on December 8, 1831. He was originally buried at Holmead&#x27;s Burying Ground, but was disinterred and reburied at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His son James Hoban Jr., said to closely resemble his father, served as U.S. attorney of the District of Columbia from 1845 to 1846.

==Work==
Little has been published to catalogue Hoban&#x27;s architectural work.

* Charleston County Courthouse, 82-86 Broad Street, Charleston, SC (1790–92). Both this building and the White House were modeled on Leinster House, the current Irish Parliament Building designed by Richard Cassels, which was built for James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster.
* The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C. – (1792–1800). Following the 1814 burning of the White House, Hoban rebuilt the Southern Portico for President James Monroe (1824), and the Northern Portico for President Andrew Jackson (1829).
*The Octagon House, 1799 New York Ave, Washington DC (1802)

==Commemorations==
Numerous events were held around 2008 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth.

In 2008, a memorial arbor to honor James Hoban was completed near his birthplace, and a major exhibition on his life took place at the White House Visitor Center.

Dublin Made Him..., a one-day colloquium in honour of Hoban, took place on October 3, 2008, at the Royal Dublin Society in Dublin, Ireland. It was presented by the RDS in association with the White House Historical Association, the U.S. Embassy in Ireland, and the James Hoban Societies of the U.S. and Ireland.

<doc id="558481" wikidata="Q56231" url="?curid=558481" title="Hassaniya Arabic">
<text>Hassaniya Arabic (; also known as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and Maure) is a variety of Maghrebi Arabic spoken by Mauritanian and Malian Arabs and the Sahrawi people. It was spoken by the Beni Ḥassān Bedouin tribes of Yemeni origin who extended their authority over most of Mauritania and Western Sahara between the 15th and 17th centuries. Hassaniya Arabic was the language spoken in the pre-modern region around Chinguetti.

The language has completely replaced the Berber languages that were originally spoken in this region. Although clearly a western dialect, Hassānīya is relatively distant from other Maghrebi variants of Arabic. Its geographical location exposed it to influence from Zenaga-Berber and Pulaar. There are several dialects of Hassaniya, which differ primarily phonetically. There are still traces of South Arabian in Hassaniya Arabic spoken between Rio de Oro and Timbuktu, according to G. S. Colin.

Today, Hassaniya Arabic is spoken in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and the Western Sahara.

== Phonology ==
The phonological system of Hassānīya exhibits both very innovative and very conservative features. All phonemes of Classical Arabic are represented in the dialect, but there are also many new phonemes. As in other Bedouin dialects, Classical /q/ corresponds mostly to dialectal ; and have merged into ; and the interdentals and have been preserved. The letter ج is realized as .

However, there is sometimes a double correspondence of a classical sound and its dialectal counterpart. Thus, classical is represented by in &#x27;to take&#x27; but by in &#x27;scissors&#x27;. Similarly, becomes in &#x27;laugh (noun)&#x27;, but in &#x27;to be sick&#x27;. Some consonant roots even have a double appearance: &#x27;heavy (mentally)&#x27; vs. &#x27;heavy (materially)&#x27;. Some of the &quot;classicizing&quot; forms are easily explained as recent loans from the literary language (such as &#x27;law&#x27;) or from sedentary dialects in case of concepts pertaining to the sedentary way of life (such as &#x27;scissors&#x27; above). For others, there is no obvious explanation (like &#x27;to be sick&#x27;). Etymological appears constantly as , never as .

Nevertheless, the phonemic status of and as well as and appears very stable, unlike in many other Arabic varieties. Somewhat similarly, classical has in most contexts disappeared or turned into or ( &#x27;family&#x27; instead of , &#x27;insist&#x27; instead of and &#x27;yesterday&#x27; instead of ). In some literary terms, however, it is clearly preserved: &#x27;suffering (participle)&#x27; (classical ).

=== Consonants ===

Hassānīya has innovated many consonants by the spread of the distinction &quot;emphatic/non-emphatic&quot;. In addition to the above-mentioned, and have a clear phonemic status and more marginally so. One additional emphatic phoneme is acquired from the neighboring Zenaga Berber language along with a whole palatal series from Niger–Congo languages of the south. At least some speakers make the distinction /p/–/b/ through borrowings from French (and Spanish in Western Sahara). All in all, the number of consonant phonemes in Hassānīya is 31, or 43 counting the marginal cases.

On the phonetic level, the classical consonants and are usually realised as voiced (hereafter marked ) and . The latter is still, however, pronounced differently from , the distinction probably being in the amount of air blown out (Cohen 1963: 13–14). In geminated and word-final positions both phonemes are voiceless, for some speakers /θ/ apparently in all positions. The uvular fricative is likewise realised voiceless in a geminated position, although not fricative but plosive: . In other positions, etymological seems to be in free variation with (etymological , however varies only with ).

=== Vowels ===
Vowel phonemes come in two series: long and short. The long vowels are the same as in Classical Arabic , and the short ones extend this by one: . The classical diphthongs and may be realised in many different ways, the most usual variants being and , respectively. Still, realisations like and as well as and are possible, although less common.

As in most Maghrebi Arabic dialects, etymological short vowels are generally dropped in open syllables (except for the feminine noun ending &lt; ): &gt; &#x27;you (f. sg.) write&#x27;, &gt; &gt; &#x27;he wrote&#x27;. In the remaining closed syllables dialectal /a/ generally corresponds to classical , while classical and have merged into . Remarkably, however, morphological is represented by and by in a word-initial pre-consonantal position: &#x27;I stood up&#x27; (root &quot;w-g-f&quot;; cf. &#x27;I wrote&#x27;, root &quot;k-t-b&quot;), &#x27;he descends&#x27; (subject prefix &quot;i-&quot;; cf. &#x27;he writes&#x27;, subject prefix &quot;jə-&quot;). In some contexts, this initial vowel even gets lengthened, which clearly demonstrates its phonological status of a vowel: &#x27;they stood up&#x27;. In addition, short vowels in open syllables are found in Berber loanwords, such as &#x27;man&#x27;, &#x27;calves of 1 to 2 years of age&#x27;, and in passive formation: &#x27;he was met&#x27; (cf. &#x27;he met&#x27;).

== Code-switching ==
Many educated Hassaniya Arabic speakers also practice code-switching. In Western Sahara it is common for code-switching to occur between Hassaniya Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Spanish, as Spain had previously controlled this region; in the rest of Hassaniya-speaking lands, French is the additional language spoken.

== Orthography ==
Hassaniya Arabic is normally written with an Arabic script. However, in Senegal, the government has adopted the use of the Latin script to write the language, as established by Decree 2005–980 of October 21, 2005. 
== Speakers distribution ==
According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there are approximately three million Hassaniya speakers, distributed as follows:

* Mauritania: 2,770,000 (2006) 
* Western Sahara and the southern area of Morocco, known as the Tekna zone: 200,000+ (1995) 
* Mali: 175,800 – 210,000 (2000) 
* Senegal: 162,000 (2015) 
* Algeria: 150,000 (1985) 
* Libya: 40,000 (1985) 
* Niger: 10,000 (1998)

<doc id="558483" wikidata="Q8020690" url="?curid=558483" title="William Young (Nova Scotia politician)">
<text>Sir William Young, (8 September 1799 – 8 May 1887) was a Nova Scotia politician and jurist.

Born in Falkirk, the son of John Young and Agnes Renny, Young was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1836 as a Reformer (or Liberal) and, as a lawyer, defended Reform journalists accused of libel. When responsible government was instituted in 1848, Young hoped to become the first Premier but was passed over in favour of fellow reformer James Boyle Uniacke and Young became Speaker. However, Young succeeded Uniacke in 1854.

His government was accused of overlooking Catholics and tensions with Catholics were exacerbated by Joseph Howe&#x27;s rupture with Nova Scotia&#x27;s Irish Catholic community over his recruitment of Americans to fight on the British side in the Crimean War.

In February 1857, ten Catholic and two Protestant Liberals voted with the Tories to bring down Young&#x27;s government.

Young returned to power in January 1860 when the Tory government was unable to command a majority in the legislature after an election. In July, the colony&#x27;s Chief Justice died and Young, who had long coveted the job, was appointed to the position by the lieutenant governor. He was noted for placing cushions on his chair so he would tower above his fellow justices. Young served as Chief Justice for twenty-one years and resigned in 1881.

==Death==
Sir William Young died in Halifax on May 8, 1887.

== Legacy ==
* Young Avenue, Halifax, Nova Scotia is named after Sir William Young
* In 1887 (the same year that the Bandstand was built), the estate of chief justice Sir William Young, donated three statues and six urns from his own garden, to Halifax Public Gardens.

<text>John Paul Larkin (March 13, 1942 – December 3, 1999), known professionally under the alias Scatman John, was an American musician and dancer. A prolific jazz pianist and vocalist for several decades, he rose to prominence during the 1990s through his fusion of scat singing and dance music. He recorded five albums, which were released between 1986 and 2002.

In the United States and Europe, Larkin is recognized for his 1995 singles &quot;Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)&quot; and &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot;. He achieved his greatest success in Japan, where his album &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot; (1995) sold over a million copies. Outside of his musical activities, he had deepened exchanges with stuttering organizations and established the Scatland Foundation in 1996 with the purpose of furthering research of and educating the public on stuttering. Larkin was a recipient of the American Speech–Language–Hearing Association&#x27;s Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community and a posthumous inductee to the National Stuttering Association Hall of Fame.

==Early life ==
Larkin was born in El Monte, California. He had a severe stutter by the time he learned to speak. This stutter contributed to his emotionally traumatic childhood. At age twelve, he began to learn the piano and was introduced to the art of scat singing two years later through records by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, among others. The piano provided him with a means of artistic expression to compensate for his speech difficulties, and he &quot;hid behind [the] piano because [he] was scared to speak.&quot;

==Musical career==
His first known performance on a studio album was in 1981 on the album &quot;Animal Sounds&quot; by Sam Phipps. In 1986, he released the self-titled album &quot;John Larkin&quot; on the Transition label. This album was produced by John himself, along with Marcia Larkin. It featured Joe Farrell on saxophone.

===&quot;Scatman John&quot;===
To advance his career in 1990, Larkin moved to Berlin, Germany. Once there, he discovered an appreciative jazz culture and started playing jazz gigs. This was when he first decided to take a monumental step away from his insecurities and add singing to his act for the first time, inspired by a standing ovation he received for a performance at the Cafe Moscow in Berlin. Soon after, his agent Manfred Zähringer from Iceberg Records (Denmark) thought of combining scat singing with modern dance music and hip hop effects. Larkin was hesitant at first, terrified of being laughed at and criticized once again, but BMG Hamburg was open.

Larkin was worried that listeners would realize he stuttered, and his wife, Judy, suggested that he talk about it directly in his music. Working with dance producers Tony Catania and Ingo Kays, he recorded the first single, &quot;Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)&quot;. After his first big hit, he adopted the new name and persona of &quot;Scatman&quot; John.

In 1995, at age 53, Larkin became a worldwide star. Sales of his debut single were slow at first, but they gradually reached number one in many countries and sold over six million records worldwide. &quot;Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)&quot; charted highly across Europe and Japan and remains his biggest-selling and most well-known song. He later followed up with the song &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot; entering the UK Singles Chart at number 10, which met lesser but still notable success, selling a million copies and charting highly throughout Europe. In 2019, &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot; had some resurgence after becoming an internet meme.

Following the success of these two singles, he released his debut album as Scatman John, also titled &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot;, which entered the top 10 album charts in many countries, including his then home Germany as well as in Switzerland, Finland and Norway; the album eventually sold millions of copies worldwide, becoming so popular that a Scatman John design appeared on Coca-Cola cans. He began a promotional and concert tour of Europe and Asia. Referring to a performance in Spain, Larkin said, &quot;the kids screamed for five minutes straight, I couldn&#x27;t start the song&quot;.

The second Scatman John album, &quot;Everybody Jam!&quot;, was released in 1996. While nowhere near as successful on an international level as his debut, the album and accompanying single took off in Japan, the country in which he would see success on a larger scale than anywhere else in the world. In Europe, subsequent singles failed to replicate the chart success of his first two singles, giving him the title two-hit wonder.

The Japanese version of &quot;Everybody Jam!&quot; included a total of five bonus tracks, including the hit singles &quot;Su Su Su Super Ki Re i&quot; and &quot;Pripri Scat&quot;, which were commissioned by Japanese companies for commercials for cosmetics and pudding respectively. The Ultraman franchise even jumped on the Scatman bandwagon, releasing a single titled &quot;Scatultraman&quot;, the cover art of which featured the Ultraman characters wearing Scatman&#x27;s trademark hat and mustache. The album reached No. 45 in Switzerland.

==Illness and death==
In late 1998, Larkin was diagnosed with lung cancer. In June 1999, he released his third and final album as Scatman John, &quot;Take Your Time&quot;. Shortly afterwards, he was sent into intensive treatment.

Larkin died at home in Los Angeles on December 3, 1999, at the age of 57. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea off the coast of Malibu, California two years later.
He was married to Judy McHugh Larkin, who died in 2023.

== Biographies ==
In 2022, 23 years after his death, Jeff Chi wrote and illustrated &quot;Who&#x27;s The Scatman?&quot;, a graphic novel biography published in German. The comic details Larkin&#x27;s rise in fame and career, as well as his recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. To gather details about Larkin&#x27;s life, Chi conducted video chats with those who knew Larkin during his jazz days and Eurodance phase, including John&#x27;s manager Manfred Zähringer, the producers of his hit singles and albums, and musicians who knew him during his career.

In March 2023, a biopic on John&#x27;s life was announced via &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The rights to the life story were given by his estate and the film is set to feature unparalleled access to the entire Scatman library, as well as previously unpublished private home videos.

In September 2024, an authorized biography on John&#x27;s life written by Gina Waggott was officially announced for a late 2025/early 2026 release. It is set to be published under Bloomsbury Publishing. Over half of the book will contain details about Larkin and his life previously never made public.

<text>Medieval studies is the academic interdisciplinary study of the Middle Ages. A historian who studies medieval studies is called a medievalist.

==Institutional development==
The term &#x27;medieval studies&#x27; began to be adopted by academics in the opening decades of the twentieth century, initially in the titles of books like G. G. Coulton&#x27;s &quot;Ten Medieval Studies&quot; (1906), to emphasize a more interdisciplinary approach to a historical subject. A major step in institutionalising this field was the foundation of the Mediaeval (now Medieval) Academy of America in 1925. In American and European universities the term &quot;medieval studies&quot; provided a coherent identity to centres composed of academics from a variety of disciplines including archaeology, art history, architecture, history, literature and linguistics. The Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael&#x27;s College of the University of Toronto became the first centre of this type in 1929; it is now the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies (PIMS) and is part of the University of Toronto. It was soon followed by the Medieval Institute at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, which was founded in 1946 but whose roots go back to the establishment of a Program of Medieval Studies in 1933. As with many of the early programs at Roman Catholic institutions, it drew its strengths from the revival of medieval scholastic philosophy by such scholars as Étienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain, both of whom made regular visits to the university in the 1930s and 1940s.

These institutions were preceded in the United Kingdom, in 1927, by the establishment of the idiosyncratic Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, at the University of Cambridge. Although Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic was limited geographically (to the British Isles and Scandinavia) and chronologically (mostly the early Middle Ages), it promoted the interdisciplinarity characteristic of Medieval Studies and many of its graduates were involved in the later development of Medieval Studies programmes elsewhere in the UK. Around the same time as the first North American Medieval Studies institutions were founded, the UK saw the development of some scholarly societies with a similar remit, including the Oxford Society for the Study of Medieval Languages and Literature (1932) and its offshoot the Manchester Medieval Society (1933).

With university expansion in the late 1960s and early 1970s encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, centres similar to (and partly inspired by) the Toronto Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies were established in England at University of Reading (1965), at University of Leeds (1967) and the University of York (1968), and in the United States at Fordham University (1971).

The 1990s saw a further wave of Medieval-Studies foundations, partly prompted by the dynamism brought to the field by its embracing of postmodernist thought and the associated rise of neo-medievalism in popular culture. This included centres at King&#x27;s College London (1988), the University of Bristol (1994), the University of Sydney (1997) and Bangor University (2005), and the merging of the Medieval History and Medieval Language and Literature sections of the British Academy to create a Medieval Studies section.

Medieval studies is buoyed by a number of annual international conferences which bring together thousands of professional medievalists, including the International Congress on Medieval Studies, at Kalamazoo MI, U.S., and the International Medieval Congress at the University of Leeds. There are a number of journals devoted to medieval studies, including: &quot;Speculum&quot; (an organ of the Medieval Academy of America founded in 1925 and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts), &quot;Medium Ævum&quot; (the journal of the Society for the Study of Medieval Languages and Literature, founded in 1932), &quot;Mediaeval Studies&quot; (based in the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies and founded in 1939), the &quot;Bulletin de Philosophie Médiévale&quot;, &quot;Mediaevalia&quot;, &quot;Comitatus&quot;, &quot;Viator&quot;, &quot;Traditio&quot;, &quot;Medieval Worlds&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Medieval History&quot;.

Another part of the infrastructure of the field is the International Medieval Bibliography.

==Historiographical development==
The term &quot;Middle Ages&quot; first began to be common in English-language history-writing in the early nineteenth century. Henry Hallam&#x27;s 1818 &quot;View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages&quot; has been seen as a key stage in the promotion of the term, along with Ruskin&#x27;s 1853 &quot;Lectures on Architecture&quot;. The term &quot;medievalist&quot; was, correspondingly, coined by English-speakers in the mid-nineteenth century. 

The concept of the Middle Ages was first developed by Renaissance humanists as a means for them to define their own era as new and different from what came before—whether a renewal of Classical Antiquity (the Renaissance) or what came to be called modernity. This gave nineteenth-century Romantic scholars, in particular, the intellectual freedom to imagine the Middle Ages as an anti-modernist utopia—whether a place nostalgically to fantasise about a more conservative, religious, and hierarchical past or a more egalitarian, beautiful, and innocent one.

European study of the medieval past was characterised in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by romantic nationalism, as emergent nation-states sought to legitimise new political formations by claiming that they were rooted in the distant past. The most important example of this use of the Middle Ages was the nation-building that surrounded the unification of Germany. Narratives which presented the nations of Europe as modernizing by building on, yet also developing beyond, their medieval heritage, were also important facets underpinning justifications of European colonialism and imperialism during the New Imperialism era. Scholars of the medieval era in the United States also used these concepts to justify their westward expansion across the North American continent. These colonialist and imperialist connections meant that medieval studies during the 19th and 20th centuries played a role in the emergence of white supremacism.

However, the early twentieth century also saw the increasing professionalisation of research on the Middle Ages. In this context, researchers tended to resist the idea that the Middle Ages were distinctively different from modernity. Instead they argued the so-called &#x27;continuity thesis&#x27; that institutions conventionally associated with modernity in Western historiography like nationalism, the emergence of states, colonialism, scientific thought, art for its own sake, or people&#x27;s conception of themselves as individuals all had a history stretching back into the Middle Ages, and that understanding their medieval history was important to understanding their character in the twentieth century. Twentieth-century Medieval Studies were influenced by approaches associated with the rise of social sciences such as economic history and anthropology, epitomised by the influential Annales School. In place of what the Annalistes called &quot;histoire événementielle&quot;, this work favoured study of large questions over long periods.

In the wake of the Second World War, the role of medievalism in European nationalism led to greatly diminished enthusiasm for medieval studies within the academy—though nationalist deployments of the Middle Ages still existed and remained powerful. The proportion of medievalists in history and language departments fell, encouraging staff to collaborate across different departments; state funding of and university support for archaeology expanded, bringing new evidence but also new methods, disciplinary perspectives, and research questions forward; and the appeal of interdisciplinarity grew. Accordingly, medieval studies turned increasingly away from producing national histories, towards more complex mosaics of regional approaches that worked towards a European scope, partly correlating with post-War Europeanisation. An example from the apogee of this process was the large European Science Foundation project The Transformation of the Roman World that ran from 1993 to 1998.

Amidst this process, from the 1980s onwards medieval studies increasingly responded to intellectual agendas set by postmodern critical theory and cultural studies, with empiricism and philology being challenged by or harnessed to topics like the history of the body. This movement tended to challenge the progressivist account of the Middle Ages as belonging to a continuum of social development that begat modernity and instead to see the Middle Ages as radically different from the present. Its recognition that scholars&#x27; views are shaped by their own time led to the study of medievalism—the post-medieval use and abuse of the Middle Ages—becoming an integral part of Medieval Studies.

In the twenty-first century, globalisation led to arguments that post-war Europeanisation had drawn too tight a boundary around medieval studies, this time at the borders of Europe, with Muslim Iberia and the Orthodox Christian east seen in western European historiography as having an ambivalent relevance to medieval studies. Thus a range of medievalists have begun working on writing global histories of the Middle Ages—while, however, navigating, the risk of imposing Eurocentric terminologies and agendas on the rest of the world. By 2020, this movement was being characterised as the &#x27;global turn&#x27; in Medieval Studies. Correspondingly, the UCLA Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, founded in 1963, changed its name in 2021 to UCLA Center for Early Global Studies.

<text>Mahabali (IAST: Mahābalī), also known as Bali, Indrasenan, or Māveli, is a daitya king featured in Hinduism. He is the grandson of Prahlada, and a descendant of the sage Kashyapa. There are many versions of his legend in ancient texts such as the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and several &quot;Puranas&quot;. According to Hindu literature, he was blessed to be one of the Chiranjivi, a group of seven immortals, by the Vamana avatar of Vishnu and reigns in the Sutaloka.

It is believed that Mahabali will become the King of Svarga (heaven) in the next &quot;yuga&quot;. In Kerala, Mahabali is considered to be the noblest and most prosperous ruler, who transformed his kingdom into a heavenly place. His legend is a major part of the annual festival Onam in the state of Kerala, and it is celebrated in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh as Balipratipada, Balipādyami, or Bali pādva (the third day of Deepavali and first day of Kartika month).

==Hinduism==
Mahabali is described in early Hindu texts as a benevolent and generous king. He ruled without discrimination, and his people were honest, healthy, and happy under his rule. Mahabali also temporarily possessed the &quot;amrita&quot; (nectar of eternal life) obtained by the &quot;asuras&quot;. The amrita allowed his subjects to bring him back to life after his death in one of the wars between &quot;suras (devas)&quot; and &quot;asuras&quot;. Mahabali was, thus, immune from death. After many wars, the invincible Bali had conquered heaven and earth. The &quot;suras&quot; (devas) approached Vishnu to save them from complete obliteration. Vishnu refused to join the devas in violence against Mahabali, because Mahabali is a benevolent king and his own devotee. To restore the natural order, he incarnated as the dwarf Brahmin avatar, Vamana. While Mahabali was performing the ashvamedha sacrifice to celebrate his victories and giving away gifts to everyone, Vamana approached him and requested &quot;three steps of land&quot;. Mahabali granted him this gift, despite warnings from Shukra, who had realised Vamana&#x27;s true identity. Vamana then metamorphosed into Vishnu&#x27;s colossal trivikrama form, the first foot encompassing all of heaven in one step and the earth with the second foot. When rhetorically asked where he might take his promised third step, Mahabali accepted his fate and offered his own head. Some Hindu texts state that Mahabali was banished to &quot;patala&quot; (netherworld), some state he was dragged there by Garuda, in others he entered heaven with the touch of Vishnu, while another version states he became &quot;Chiranjivi&quot; (immortal). Others even have Bali admitted into Vaikuntha, which was an even higher place than the realm of the devas.

In other versions of the story, when Vamana asks where to place his next step, Mahabali offers his own head to him because he realizes that he is an avatar of Vishnu. Vishnu then sends the king to &quot;patala&quot;, but seeing Mahabali&#x27;s gesture, he is pleased and wants Mahabali to ask for a boon. Mahabali wishes for Vishnu to stay with him in his palace in &quot;patala&quot; and give him the privilege of serving him. However, when Goddess Lakshmi finds out, she does not approve. She goes to &quot;patala&quot;, makes Mahabali her brother, and requests him to let her husband come back to her in Vaikuntha. In response to this situation, Vishnu decides that he will visit Mahabali&#x27;s palace every year and rest/sleep there for four months. To ensure that the world continues to function while he is resting in &quot;patala&quot;, Vishnu gave his responsibility of running the world to Shiva. Those four months, during which Vishnu rests and Shiva runs the world, are known as Chaturmas. In this way, Mahabali played an important part in the start of Chaturmas.

According to one story, Vishnu granted Bali a boon whereby he could return to his homeland once every year. The harvest festivals of Balipratipada and Onam are celebrated to mark his yearly homecoming. Literature and inscriptions in Hindu temples suggest that these festivals, featuring colourful decorations, lighted lamps, gift giving, feasts and community events, have been popular in India for more than a millennium. Bali is also featured in the Ramayana where Ravana tries to free him from Patala, but is unable to.

Mahabhali had a wife named Vindhyavalli, who was also referred to as Ashrama. With her he had many sons, including the Shiva devotee Bana (Banasura) and Namasu (Prince Namuchi). It is believed that Vindhyavalli once saved Bana from the wrath of Krishna.

==Jainism==
King Mahabali is also found in the mythologies of Jainism. He is the sixth of nine Prativasudevas (Prati-narayanas, anti-heroes). He is depicted as an evil king who schemed and attempted to rob Purusha&#x27;s wife. He is defeated and killed by Purusha. In Jain mythology, the antagonists to Mahabali are the two sons born to King Mahasiva (Mahasiras): Ananda (the sixth Baladeva) and Purusapundarika (the sixth Vasudeva).

Mahabali is also mentioned in Jain inscriptions, where the patron compares the defeated evil opponents of the current king to Mahabali. For example, in the Girnar inscriptions of Gujarat dated to about 1231 CE (1288 Vikrama era), minister Vastupala of the Chaulukya dynasty is praised as a great king by Jains, and the inscriptions connect him to Mahabali because Vastupala gave much charity. Some excerpts from the inscriptions are:
: In olden times Mahabali was pressed down by the foot of Vishnu, the enemy of the demons, from the earth; now the same is done by the hand of Vastupala...
:O Vastupala, Mahabali has sent thee a message that he has been much pleased by hearing from Narada, who visits the three worlds, that though frequently solicited thou dost not extend thy anger to the needy...
: By the famous minister Vastupala watering the earth with nectarial charities, the pride of Mahabali and Kalpataru has been greatly lowered...
: Let there be continuous salutation to holy Mahabali and Karna, whose charity though unseen has been the object of so much fame; consequently the people are worthy of worship, and the great minister Vastupala&#x27;s charity which the people see with their eyes so great that even the world itself can scarcely contain it.

Mahabali is a common name and found in other contexts. For example, in Jain history, Mahabali is the name of the son of Bahubali, who was given Bahubali&#x27;s kingdom before Bahubali became a monk. 

==Buddhism==
Bali appears in several Buddhist sutras, such as the Dānapāramitā Sūtra, the Ratnamegha Sūtra, and the Lotus Sutra; where he is seen among the audience who listens to the Buddha&#x27;s discourses.

The Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra features an extensive dialogue between Bali and the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara that occurred during the life of the Buddha Viśvabhū. Bali relates his story of being imprisoned in the underworld by Nārāyaṇa. The asura king repents for his misdeeds and praises the qualities of Avalokiteśvara and the pure land Sukhāvatī. Avalokiteśvara bestows a prediction that Bali will someday become a fully awakended buddha named Śrī who will lead the asuras in the Dharma.

Bali offers Avalokiteśvara &quot;strings of pearls worth a hundred thousand silver coins and diadems adorned with various jewels.&quot; Before leaving his abode, Avalokiteśvara gives a teaching about how humans must leave Jambudvīpa upon death and are subject to the punishments of King Yama in hell. He then tells Bali of the importance of cultivating merit in this life.

==Veneration==
For people in Kerala, Mahabali is remembered fondly as a great and benevolent king. Keralites celebrate the festival Onam to commemorate the glorious days of Mahabali. They believe that Mahabali, once ruled Kerala. During Onam, the asura king is believed to return to see his people.

In Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, several people believe that Mahabali was an ancient king. Special puja is offered during the third day of Deepavali and first day of Kartika month, which they call, &#x27;Bali padwa&#x27;, &#x27; Bali pratipada&#x27;, and &#x27;Bali Padyami&#x27;. In coastal Karnataka, people offer a special dish to the being on a plate prepared with bamboo tree sticks, along with a lamp, and through the medium of a Tulu folklore song, request him to accept their offerings. People believe that on the third day of the festival, the king comes out of Patala for a day to see his kingdom.

The town of Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu is also associated with him.

<text>Michael Edward Redmond (born December 27, 1947) is a Canadian former professional hockey player. He is currently a color commentator for Detroit Red Wings games on television for FanDuel Sports Network Detroit.

==Playing career==
Redmond played right wing for the Montreal Canadiens from 1967-1971, winning Stanley Cups with them in 1968 and 1969. He scored 27 goals for the Canadiens in the 1969–70 season.

Halfway through the 1970–71 NHL season he was traded to the Red Wings in a deal that sent superstar Frank Mahovlich to Montreal. His promise was fulfilled the season following, when he scored 42 goals on a line centered by veteran star Alex Delvecchio.

In 1972–1973, Redmond became the seventh player in NHL history and the first Red Wing player to score 50 goals in a season. He finished a career year with 52 goals (surpassing Gordie Howe&#x27;s team record of 49) and 93 points. Redmond&#x27;s record would stand until John Ogrodnick tallied 55 goals during the 1985 season. Delvecchio retired early in the 1973–74 season to become the team&#x27;s coach, and Redmond was moved onto a line with budding superstar Marcel Dionne. Redmond&#x27;s success continued, and he became only the third player (after Bobby Hull and Phil Esposito) to achieve back-to-back 50 goal seasons with 51 goals (including an NHL leading 21 power play goals).

In the 1974–75 season Redmond sustained a back injury and played only 29 games. His back woes continued the following year; after 37 games he retired early at the age of 28. He had been named to the league&#x27;s First All-Star Team in 1973, the Second Team in 1974, and he played in one All-Star Game in 1974.

Redmond&#x27;s younger brother Dick was an NHL defenseman. He played thirteen seasons, primarily with the Chicago Blackhawks and the Boston Bruins.

===Regular season and playoffs===
===International===
==Broadcasting==
After his playing career ended, Redmond became a color commentator on television. His television stops include CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, &quot;NHL on ESPN&quot; usually with Dan Kelly, Mike Lange, or Sam Rosen, &quot;NHL on Fox&quot; and for most of his broadcasting career, local television coverage of the Red Wings with play-by-play announcers Dave Strader, Mike Goldberg, and (currently) Ken Daniels. His catchphrases are referred to by fans as &quot;Mickeyisms&quot;. In one memorable string, Mickey used the following to describe a scramble in the crease- &quot;Ten hungry lumberjacks, one pork chop left on the plate, and who should come up with it but Brett Hull!&quot;

Redmond was a frequent guest on &quot;Drew and Mike In the Morning&quot; on WRIF. Redmond provided in-studio pre- and post-game commentary for WXYZ when ABC broadcast NHL games that featured the Red Wings and currently does the same on NBC-broadcast Wings games for WDIV.

Redmond only does commentary for home games and away games with short trips, due to having coeliac disease, survived lung cancer twice and having a lot of difficulty of finding gluten-free meals over an extended road trip. In those cases, his duties are covered by Chris Osgood and/or Larry Murphy.

In 2011, Redmond was the recipient of the Hockey Hall of Fame&#x27;s Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, named after Foster Hewitt and presented by the Hockey Hall of Fame to members of the radio and television industry who make outstanding contributions to their profession and the game of ice hockey during their broadcasting career. The award winners are selected by the NHL Broadcasters Association.

In 2022, Redmond was part of the Class of 2022 inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in Detroit.

<text>The Baton Broadcast System ( ), also known as BBS, was a Canadian system of television stations located in Ontario and Saskatchewan, owned by Baton Broadcasting. BBS was the successor to two provincial systems also owned by Baton, the Saskatchewan Television Network (STN) and Ontario Network Television (ONT).

During the 1990s, BBS and its predecessors served as a complementary programming service to the CTV Television Network, to which most (but not all) of the system&#x27;s stations were already affiliated. Shortly after Baton&#x27;s acquisition of CTV in 1997 and the contemporaneous sale of Baton&#x27;s independent stations (later re-acquired by Bell and currently part of the parallel CTV 2 system), the BBS brand was eliminated, and the system&#x27;s operations were merged into the CTV network.

==History==
===Background===
During its years as a cooperative, CTV did not broadcast a complete primetime schedule. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it broadcast 60 hours of common programming each week, with a few gaps in primetime for affiliates to schedule locally; in some cases stations could even pick when to air network programs.

During this same period, CTV&#x27;s profits began to decline, and by the early 1990s the network was posting losses, largely due to increased competition from the CanWest Global System and other independent stations. Many affiliate groups, such as Baton and WIC – the latter already owning several independent stations – decided they would prefer to buy and air more of their own programming. Accordingly, as part of CTV&#x27;s 1993 restructuring, network programming was reduced to 42.5 hours (and soon after to 40), including 12 hours in primetime. From this point on (until 1998), CTV network programming only took up about half of affiliates&#x27; primetime schedules.

===Ontario Network Television: 1991-1994===
ONT was initiated in 1991, consisting of eight CTV affiliates – seven owned by Baton (CFTO, CJOH, CHRO, and the MCTV stations) and Electrohome&#x27;s CKCO. Initially providing 10.5 hours of common programming each week, this was soon expanded to 35 hours.

While ONT was a secondary affiliation and not a separate network from CTV, some claimed it was a first step towards the Baton stations becoming a separate network. Indeed, Baton began to bid against CTV for the rights to new U.S. series. However, Baton&#x27;s president at the time, Douglas Bassett, contended it was merely a &quot;marketing vehicle&quot; to compete with CanWest Global&#x27;s CIII-TV, a single station which served almost all of Ontario.

In 1993, Baton acquired two independent stations, CFPL and CKNX, and launched a third, CHWI. These stations replaced CKCO within ONT. In response, CKCO and WIC&#x27;s CHCH-TV Hamilton announced a joint initiative of their own, known as &quot;Market One Television&quot;; however, this partnership was short-lived.

In addition to the CTV affiliates and independent stations, some ONT (and later BBS) programming may have aired on Baton&#x27;s CBC affiliates, part of twinstick operations in northern Ontario. In the rest of Canada, Baton sublicensed its programming to individual stations, usually CTV affiliates. Even the ONT brand was seen from time to time in the rest of Canada, mainly through Baton-produced Toronto Blue Jays games.

===The BBS years: 1994-1997===
In October 1994, Baton hired the management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company to help evaluate how to proceed with its national expansion plans. McKinsey&#x27;s report recommended, first and foremost, that Baton attempt to take control of the CTV trademark, which it saw as one of the most valuable brands in Canada, through the acquisition of as many other CTV affiliates (and their corresponding shares in the network) as possible. However, the report also recommended that Baton create a new national brand as a backup, to help reduce the damage should Baton&#x27;s gambit fail and CTV pass into a competitor&#x27;s hands.

This new brand turned out to be BBS, with a logo adapted from CFTO&#x27;s multicoloured-iris logo. Baton&#x27;s local stations dropped their individual logos and adopted the new BBS symbol, with the station call letters positioned beneath. In contrast, ONT was simply a secondary brand and had not replaced local station logos. Despite the value Baton placed in the CTV brand, BBS became more a more prominent part of these stations&#x27; branding than CTV itself.

BBS replaced ONT in fall 1994, with the addition of Baton&#x27;s six stations in Saskatchewan – CTV affiliates CKCK-TV in Regina, CFQC-TV in Saskatoon, CICC-TV in Yorkton, and CIPA-TV in Prince Albert, and CBC affiliates CKOS-TV in Yorkton and CKBI-TV in Prince Albert. They had been jointly branded as the &quot;Saskatchewan Television Network&quot; since 1987.

Programming included U.S. series such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and &quot;Ellen&quot;, the soap opera &quot;Family Passions&quot;, a Saturday morning block of mainly Disney cartoons branded as &quot;BBS Master Control&quot; (including &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot; and programming from &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning&quot;), news and talk programming such as &quot;Sunday Edition&quot; and &quot;The Dini Petty Show&quot;, and sports programming such as Blue Jays games, which were again syndicated to other Canadian stations.

As a result of the Baton-Electrohome alliance, CKCO (now jointly owned by both companies) joined the system in 1996. Baton and Electrohome also jointly acquired CFCN-TV in Calgary around the same time; both CFCN and Electrohome-owned CFRN-TV in Edmonton aired much of the BBS lineup, but did not actively use the BBS brand.

===Acquisition of CTV===
In 1997, Baton bought controlling interest in CTV, and became the sole corporate owner of the network later that year after the remaining station owners sold their shares. Baton continued to consider the long-standing CTV brand much preferable to its lesser-known BBS moniker, and had not bothered to introduce the latter brand to its new acquisitions.

Almost immediately after its purchase of CTV was complete, Baton introduced new station logos on all of its CTV-affiliated stations that incorporated the network brand, and began using the CTV logo in all programming and promotions where the BBS logo was previously used, even though these programs remained separate from the CTV network service proper. The BBS name was completely dropped no later than the end of January 1998, and Baton itself changed its corporate name to CTV Inc. later that year.

Nevertheless, BBS lived on in a very limited sense until 2001, since CTV maintained a separate stream of programming not part of the CTV network service – though as noted above, from this point on such shows were branded as CTV programs on the network&#x27;s O&amp;Os. This structure was necessary because the &quot;old&quot; CTV&#x27;s affiliation agreements, which generally limited network service to 40 hours a week, remained in force. For instance, CHAN-TV (then known as BCTV) was Vancouver&#x27;s CTV affiliate but carried no more than 40 hours of CTV programming (for instance, in its final seasons as a CTV affiliate, it did not broadcast &quot;Canada AM&quot; at all, airing local news instead, although sister station CHEK-TV did air &quot;CanAM&quot;) while CTV-owned independent station CIVT-TV carried the remainder. As its establishment came shortly before Baton adopted the CTV name for its stations, CIVT did not use the BBS name, instead branding as Vancouver Television (VTV).

Other affiliates such as CKY in Winnipeg, NTV in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, and to a lesser extent CFCF in Montreal, usually acquired additional programming, as they had from BBS. However, these programs were not added to the base 40-hour network schedule (which was part of a traditional network arrangement whereby the network retained most of the ad inventory and affiliates were compensated with airtime payments) – instead, stations had to pay the network for these additional programs, although they would sell all ads locally (which made the practice more akin to all-cash syndication rather than the more contemporary U.S. practice of reverse compensation). Series would sometimes switch back and forth between network and non-network status, and in limited cases alternate programming was supplied to affiliates in the event that specific episodes of a non-network program (e.g., &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;) were scheduled for a timeslot that had been previously allocated as network time.

On September 1, 2001, CIVT became the Vancouver CTV owned-and-operated station, displacing BCTV and CHEK; around the same time, CTV acquired CKY and CFCF, giving the network&#x27;s O&amp;O stations group coverage of virtually all major Canadian markets. As a result, CTV elected not to renew its national network licence with the CRTC, and the largely artificial distinction between network and non-network programming was eliminated at this point. CTV would later re-apply for a separate regional licence used specifically to provide programming to affiliates owned by third parties. In this sense, CTV as it presently operates could be seen as an enlarged BBS by another name, rather than the direct successor to the &quot;original&quot; CTV; however, for most viewers, this is a technicality of little practical significance.

Baton&#x27;s independents and newly disaffiliated CHRO were sold to CHUM Limited, becoming NewNet stations; however CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media), Baton&#x27;s successor as a corporate entity, reacquired them as part of its purchase of CHUM Limited in 2007. These stations are now operated by Bell Media under the CTV 2 banner.

Baton&#x27;s CBC affiliates were later sold to the public broadcaster, and became repeaters of other CBC owned-and-operated stations. CTVgm would later acquire another CBC affiliate, CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba, as part of the CHUM purchase, which closed down in late 2009 after a variety of efforts to sell the station failed. Bell Media then acquired two additional two CBC affiliates in interior British Columbia (CJDC-TV Dawson Creek and CFTK-TV Terrace) as part of its 2013 purchase of Astral Media, eventually converting both to CTV 2 stations in 2016.

<text>Living Marxism was a British magazine originally launched in 1988 as the journal of the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). The magazine attracted attention for denying both the Rwandan genocide and Bosnian genocide. Rebranded as LM in 1992, it ceased publication in March 2000 following a successful libel lawsuit brought by ITN over Living Marxism&#x27;s criticism of ITN&#x27;s coverage of the Bosnian war. It was promptly resurrected as &quot;Spiked&quot;, an Internet magazine.

==History==
It was published by Junius Publications Ltd until 1997, and then by Informinc Ltd. Its editor, Mick Hume, an American Studies graduate from Manchester University then aged 29, said: &quot;Our readers are young, angry, thinking people.&quot; At its peak in the 1990s, it had a circulation of between 10,000 and 15,000.

== Aims ==
&quot;Living Marxism&quot;&#x27;s introduction summarised its outlook as follows: 

== Views ==
Views expounded with regularity in &quot;LM&quot; included &quot;fear culture&quot;, for example by questioning the then media coverage of AIDS as a predominantly homosexual disease in the West. Its critique covered media coverage in Africa and the developing world in the context of Western intervention, underdevelopment and poverty. It debated environmentalist claims that limiting consumption was a progressive view.

&quot;LM&quot; writers criticised the media portrayal of the civil wars in Rwanda and Bosnia and disputed that either Serb or Hutu forces committed genocide during those conflicts. In 1993, &quot;LM&quot; published an exhibition titled &quot;Genocide against the Serbs&quot; which juxtaposed images of Serbs killed in World War II-era crimes with Serbian soldiers killed in battle during the Yugoslav Wars. In 1995, &quot;LM&quot; published an article by Fiona Fox arguing that:
Historian Marko Attila Hoare criticised their genocide denial in relation to both the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides.

It has been suggested by environmentalists such as George Monbiot and Peter Melchett that the group of writers associated with &quot;LM&quot; continue to constitute an &quot;LM&quot; network pursuing an ideologically motivated anti-environmentalist agenda under the guise of promoting humanism. Writers who used to write for &quot;Living Marxism&quot; reject this as a &quot;McCarthyite conspiracy theory&quot;.

== ITN vs. &quot;LM&quot; ==

In February 1997, editor Mick Hume published an article by German journalist Thomas Deichmann which claimed that ITN had misrepresented the Bosnian war in its coverage in 1992. The publishers of &quot;LM&quot;, Informinc (LM) Ltd., were sued for libel by ITN. The case initially caused international condemnation of ITN as one of &quot;LM&quot;″s critics, the journalist George Monbiot, who wrote in &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine: 

However, Monbiot continued: 

The article &quot;The picture that fooled the world&quot; argued that ITN&#x27;s footage in which an emaciated Bosnian Muslim man stood behind a barbed wire fence was designed to portray a Nazi-style extermination camp while Deichmann claimed: &quot;It was not a prison, and certainly not a &#x27;concentration camp&#x27;, but a collection centre for refugees, many of whom went there seeking safety and could leave again if they wished&quot;. However, an examination of the substance of this case by a professor of cultural and political geography at Durham University argues that the key claims made by Deichmann and &quot;LM&quot; are &quot;erroneous and flawed&quot;.

The libel case went against &quot;LM&quot; and in March 2000 the magazine was forced to close. Reporters Penny Marshall and Ian Williams were each awarded £150,000 over the &quot;LM&quot; story and the magazine was ordered to pay £75,000 for libelling ITN in a February 1997 article.

Looking back Hume commented in &quot;The Times&quot;: 

In contrast, Professor Campbell of Durham University summarised his study of the case as follows: [A]s strange as existing British libel law is, it had an important and surprisingly beneficial effect in the case of ITN vs LM. The LM defendants and Thomas Deichmann were properly represented at the trial and were able to lay out all the details of their claim that the ITN reporters had &quot;deliberately misrepresented&quot; the situation at Trnopolje. Having charged &#x27;deliberate misrepresentation&#x27;, they needed to prove &#x27;deliberate misrepresentation&#x27;. To this end, the LM defendants were able to cross-examine Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, as well as every member of the ITN crews who were at the camps, along with other witnesses. (That they didn&#x27;t take up the opportunity to cross-examine the Bosnian doctor imprisoned at Trnopolje, who featured in the ITN stories and was called to testify on the conditions he and others suffered, was perhaps the moment any remaining shred of credibility for LM&#x27;s allegations evaporated). They were able to show the ITN reports to the court, including the rushes from which the final TV stories were edited, and conduct a forensic examination of the visuals they alleged were deceitful. And all of this took place in front of a jury of twelve citizens who they needed to convince about the truthfulness of their allegations.

They failed. The jury found unanimously against LM and awarded the maximum possible damages. So it was not ITN that bankrupted LM. It was LM&#x27;s lies about the ITN reports that bankrupted themselves, morally and financially. Despite their failure, those who lied about the ITN reports have had no trouble obtaining regular access to the mainstream media in Britain, where they continue to make their case as though the 2000 court verdict simply didn&#x27;t exist. Their freedom of speech has thus not been permanently infringed.

<text>Benjamin Paul Blood (November 21, 1832 – January 15, 1919) was an American philosopher, mystic and poet. His idiosyncratic work explored his development of his pluralist philosophy, culminating in the posthumously published book &quot;Pluriverse&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in Amsterdam, New York. His father, John Blood, was a prosperous landowner. Blood was known as an intelligent man but an unfocused one. Initially, his writing consisted of letters, either to local newspapers or to friends such as James Hutchison Stirling, Alfred Tennyson and William James. Ralph Barton Perry wrote of Blood:He was born in 1832 and lived for eighty-six years. During that time he wrote much, but unsystematically. His favorite form of publication was letters to newspapers, mainly local newspapers with a small circulation. These letters &quot;dealt with an astonishing diversity of subjects, from local petty politics or the tricks of spiritualist mediums to principles of industry and finance and profundities of metaphysics.&quot;

Early books included &quot;The Philosophy of Justice Between God and Man&quot; (1851) and &quot;Optimism: The Lesson of Ages&quot; (1860), a Christian mystical vision of the pursuit of happiness from Blood&#x27;s distinctly American perspective; on the title page of the book, Blood described it as &quot;A compendium of democratic theology, designed to illustrate necessities whereby all things are as they are, and to reconcile the discontents of men with the perfect love and power of ever-present God.&quot; During his lifetime he was best known for his poetry, which included &quot;The Bride of the Iconoclast&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot;, and &quot;The Colonnades&quot;. According to Christopher Nelson, Blood was a direct influence on William James&#x27; &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; as well on James&#x27;s concept of Sciousness, prime reality consciousness without a sense of self.

After experiencing the anesthetic nitrous oxide during a dental operation, Blood concluded that the gas had opened his mind to new ideas and continued experimenting with it. In 1874, he published a 37-page pamphlet, &quot;The Anesthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy&quot;.

He married twice; to Mary Sayles, and following her death, to Harriet Lefferts. He had six children from the first marriage, and a daughter from the second. Blood died in Amsterdam, New York. His final work, &quot;Pluriverse&quot;, was published posthumously.

<text>Edwin James Graham (born 20 February 1977) is an English musician who is best known as the original drummer of the rock band The Darkness, as well as the subsequent successor band Stone Gods fronted by guitarist and singer Richie Edwards.

== Early life==
Graham grew up in Oulton Broad in Lowestoft, attending Kirkley High School with the Hawkins brothers. Not particularly sporty, Graham would spend his break times isolated in the music room where he began to play the drums. After school Graham studied art at Lowestoft College. In 1998 and 1999, Graham studied Film and Television at Salisbury College, gaining a Higher National Diploma.

==Career==
After leaving Salisbury College, Graham returned to Lowestoft and worked in a Sanyo factory for six months to raise money to move to London. In the year 2000 he moved to Finsbury Park, soon relocating to Camden Town, where he remained for over ten years. His first band in London was Q*Sling fronted by Norwegian born Paul-Ronney Angel, who later went on to form the Urban Voodoo Machine.

The Darkness were conceived at a millennium eve party by the Hawkins brothers, Justin and Dan. The line up was completed some months later by Graham and bass player Frankie Poullain. Graham played on three studio albums: &quot;Permission to Land&quot;, &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back&quot; and &quot;Hot Cakes&quot;. In 2006, the Darkness split due to Justin Hawkins leaving. Graham and Dan Hawkins went on to form the Stone Gods, recruiting Toby Macfarlaine and promoting Darkness guitar technician Richie Edwards to frontman.

In July 2008, it was announced that he was permanently leaving the band due to health issues. SPIN magazine confirmed that Graham was suffering with avascular necrosis, a rare condition causing lack of blood supply to the femur. In 2009, Graham underwent bilateral hip surgery (a major operation) which was a complete success.

Subsequently, he formed the band Karaoke for Beginners with ex Silverfish guitarist Andrew &quot;Fuzz&quot; Duprey.

In 2011, the Darkness reunited with all four founding members, with Download 2011 being one of their first come back shows. Following this, the band played numerous European and U.S festivals and toured with Lady Gaga. In October 2014, it was announced that Graham and the band were no longer working together, stating that &quot;for various reasons, we have all decided to move on. We love Ed and we wish him happiness.&quot;

In 2015, Graham was the subject of a photographic documentary by photographer Nick Elliott recording Graham&#x27;s personal and professional life since his departure from the Darkness.

In 2015, Graham formed another band with singer-songwriter Angus Duprey, brother of Fuzz Duprey. The band, Puppets to the Supreme Commander, intended to release an EP and play UK shows ahead of an album release.

In 2017, Graham performed drums for a one-off band, the Venus Reaction. The project, set up by friend and Puppets to the Supreme Commander bandmate David Donley, also featured Amie Conradine, Jim Lowe, and Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols. The band released a double A side vinyl single, in a limited run of 500 copies.

<doc id="558516" wikidata="Q629207" url="?curid=558516" title="David J. Stevenson">
<text>David John Stevenson (born 2 September 1948) is a professor of planetary science at Caltech. Originally from New Zealand, he received his Ph.D. from Cornell University in physics, where he proposed a model for the interior of Jupiter. He is well known for applying fluid mechanics and magnetohydrodynamics to understand the internal structure and evolution of planets and moons.

==Sending a probe into the Earth==
Stevenson&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek idea about sending a probe into the earth includes the use of nuclear weapons to crack the Earth&#x27;s crust, simultaneously melting and filling the crack with molten iron containing a probe. The iron, by the action of its weight, will propagate a crack into the mantle and would subsequently sink and reach the Earth&#x27;s core in weeks. Communication with the probe would be achieved with modulated acoustic waves. This idea was used in the book &quot;Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
In 1984, he received the H. C. Urey Prize awarded by the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. 

Stevenson is a fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.

Minor planet 5211 Stevenson is named in his honor.

<text>Ikeja is the capital city of Lagos State in southwestern Nigeria. Its population, as of the 2006 census, is . Prior to the emergence of military rule in the early 1980s, Ikeja was a well planned, clean and quiet residential and commercial town with shopping malls, pharmacies and government reservation areas. It lies 17 km northwest of Lagos city. The Murtala Muhammed International Airport is located in the city. Ikeja is also home to Femi Kuti&#x27;s Africa Shrine and Lagbaja&#x27;s Motherland, both venues for live music. Its Ikeja City Mall is the largest shopping mall on the Lagos State mainland. Ikeja also has its own radio station, broadcasting both in English (Eko FM) and in Yoruba (Radio Lagos).

== History ==
Ikeja, which was formally called &quot;Akeja&quot;, was named after a deity of the Awori people of Ota. It was originally settled by the Awori people, and the area was raided for slaves until the mid-19th century. Early in the 20th century, it became an agricultural hinterland for Lagos. The opening of the Lagos-Ibadan railway in 1901 and the growth of Lagos as a port transformed Ikeja into a residential and industrial suburb of that city. In the mid-1960s an industrial estate was established, and in 1976 Ikeja became the capital of Lagos state. Johnson Solanke Tomori was an important in the history of Ikeja. He contributed to all the socio-cultural aspects of Ikeja, Agidingbi, Oregun, Alausa, Ojodu, and all the suburbs of Ikeja. His contributions date back to 1965, when he brought a higher level of social consciousness to Ikeja. The first king of Ikeja was His Royal Majesty Oba Momodu Illo, whom was a descendant of Akeja Oniyanrun and ruled Ikeja from 1957 till 1997.

==Government and Infrastructure==
The local government administrative headquarters of Ikeja is located within the Ikeja Local Government Secretariat premises. As of June 2019, the Chairman of Ikeja&#x27;s local government is Engr. Mojeed Balogun.

The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has its headquarters in Ikeja on the grounds of Murtala Muhammad Airport. The Accident Investigation Bureau of the Nigerian government has its headquarter in Ikeja. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has its head office in Aviation House on the grounds of the airport; this was formerly just the Lagos office.

==Economy==

=== Airlines ===
Several airlines have their head offices located in Ikeja. Arik Air&#x27;s head office is in the Arik Air Aviation Centre on the grounds of Murtala Muhammed Airport. Aero Contractors has its head office on the grounds of Murtala Muhammed Airport. Other airlines with Ikeja head offices include Overland Airways, Air Peace, Associated Aviation, and Dana Air. In addition, Virgin Atlantic has its Nigerian office in &quot;The Place&quot; in Ikeja.

At one point, Nigeria Airways had its head office in Airways House. Before it was dissolved, Afrijet Airlines had its head office in the NAHCO Building on the grounds of the airport. Bellview Airlines had its headquarters in the Bellview Plaza. Other now-defunct airlines with head offices in Ikeja include Air Nigeria (formerly Nigerian Eagle and Virgin Nigeria Airways), on the 9th Floor of Etiebets Place, Sosoliso Airlines, and ADC Airlines.

=== Television studios ===
Ikeja is home to Nigeria&#x27;s most important television studios, such as Channels TV and African Independent TV, as well as associated advertising agencies.

=== Computer Village ===
Ikeja is home to a large computer market, popularly known as Otigba. Begun in 1997 as a small market of only 10 shops, the current market now has well over 10,000. While most vendors provide the expected computer sales and repair services, it is also possible to find sales and repair services for various types of office equipment and electronic devices.

By 2019, the little shops at Computer Village had grown to multiple-storey shopping malls. Many of the single-floor buildings have been developed into larger buildings, housing several shops that distribute and repair mobile phones, laptops, printers and other electronic devices. Nearly all the major Nigerian banks have branches around the market.

As the market is unplanned, it has experienced difficulties in its growth, with some local residents expressing frustration at the market&#x27;s expansion. Traffic around the area has become very congested, and it can be almost impossible to find a place to park. Furthermore, the electrical infrastructure, which was already unreliable, has become overloaded by the new market, which requires significant amounts of electricity to demonstrate working computer products to potential customers.

=== Brewery ===

The Guinness brewery produces its famous beer in Ikeja. Apparently, the average Nigerian drinks larger quantities of this beverage than the average Irishman. The brewery also produces non-alcoholic and halal malt beer, which is part of the &quot;Lagos&#x27; way of life&quot;.

=== Pharmaceutical industry ===
60% of West Africa&#x27;s pharmaceutical production takes place in Nigeria. The majority of Nigerian pharmaceutical manufacturers have their main production site in Ikeja. This includes May &amp; Baker, one of the three largest manufacturers of medicines.

=== Diverse ===
A slum in Ikeja was selected by C. J. Obasi as a production location for the 2014 Nollywood thriller, Ojuju.

Ikeja also has a main market area called Oba Momodu Illo (Obada) market in Ipodo. This market contains many shops and makeshift stalls where merchants display and sell produce, meat, fish, grains, and other groceries.

== Tourism ==

=== Museums ===

The &quot;Kalakuta Museum&quot; commemorates the late musician Fela Kuti, who probably had a formative role in Nigeria&#x27;s music world comparable to that of Bob Marley in Jamaica. The building was the musician&#x27;s second home in Lagos after soldiers burnt down his first home in Surulere in February 1977, raped female family members and injured Kuti&#x27;s mother, a respected trade union leader, so badly that she died as a result. Kuti built a new house in Ikeja, but it fell into disrepair after his death and had to be renovated as a museum in 2012. Kuti&#x27;s grave is located next to the museum. Inside the museum, the walls are covered with historical photos, posters, paintings, murals, record covers and newspaper cuttings. Some of Fela&#x27;s musical instruments are on display, including his colourfully painted, distinctive tenor saxophone. Fela&#x27;s shoes and shirts are on display in rows, as are stage suits and the fur coat he wore on tour in Europe and the USA. There is a rooftop café, and visitors can stay overnight in one of several air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms.

=== Parks and squares ===
*The Johnson Jakande Tinubu Park (JJT) is a public park located in Ikeja, the capital of Lagos. The park which was commissioned by the then Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode in December 2017 as a recreational Center.
*The Kanu Ndubuisi Park is a public park and recreational center located in Ikeja, Lagos. It is a green space created and managed by the Lagos State Parks and Garden Agency.

*Dr Oluyomi Abayomi Finnih Recreational Park located at 3 Opebi Link Rd, Allen, Ikeja 101233, Lagos.
*Abiola Garden Ojota

=== Music pub ===

Contrary to what the name suggests, the &quot;New Afrika Shrine&quot; in Ikeja is not a shrine, but a music bar run by the descendants of Fela Kuti. It unfolds its special charm when live music is playing; it is also the only place in Lagos where you can legally smoke a joint. The Afrika Shrine was Fela&#x27;s second home until a few weeks before his death in 1997, after which it fell into disrepair. The New Afrika Shrine, opened in 2000, was built by his family under the direction of his eldest daughter Yeni and eldest son Femi. Their main concern was to honour and preserve the contribution Fela and the Shrine have made to the local community and the overall development of post-colonial Africa. Most events at the New Afrika Shrine are free of charge. Femi performs with his band The Positive Force every Thursday and Sunday when he is not on tour. His younger brother Seun performs with Egypt 80 every last Saturday of the month. The new club is four times the size of the original Shrine and seats two and a half thousand people. Overheads are covered by the sale of food, drinks and merchandise. Admission is usually 500 naira, half a US dollar. The club has a small library, pool tables and chill-out areas and organises educational and outreach activities.

<text>Michael David McCready (born April 5, 1966) is an American musician known for being a founding member and lead guitarist of Pearl Jam. McCready was also a member of the side project bands Flight to Mars, Temple of the Dog, Mad Season, and The Rockfords. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a part of Pearl Jam in 2017 alongside the three other founding members (Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard and Eddie Vedder), and former member Dave Krusen.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Mike McCready was born in Pensacola, Florida, but his family moved to Seattle shortly after his birth. When he was a child, his parents played Jimi Hendrix and Santana; while his friends listened to Kiss and Aerosmith, McCready would frequently play bongo drums. At the age of eleven, McCready purchased his first guitar and began taking lessons.

In eighth grade, McCready formed his first band, Warrior, whose name soon changed to Shadow. Originally a cover band playing during free periods at Roosevelt High School, the band eventually began writing original material and recording demo tapes. After high school, McCready worked at a pizza restaurant where he befriended musician Pete Droge. In 1986, Shadow relocated to Los Angeles and attempted to cut a record deal. However, according to McCready:

We played to a couple bartenders down there, but even though it was a bad scene, it was a good experience. Basically, we weren&#x27;t that good of a band, and we didn&#x27;t realize it until we got down there. I guess we lost our focus, got really bummed out and came back to Seattle.

In 1988, Shadow returned to Seattle and split up soon afterwards. McCready lost interest in playing guitar for some time, stating that he was &quot;so depressed about life&quot;. He cut his hair, enrolled in a local community college, and spent his nights working at a video store. He credits a friend named Russ Riedner for getting him &quot;out of my college mode and back into playing guitar&quot;. McCready was inspired to pick up his guitar again after attending a Stevie Ray Vaughan concert at The Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington. McCready said:

As soon as he started &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot;, these huge clouds rolled in overhead, and rain began pouring down. When the song ended, the rain stopped! It was like a religious experience, and it changed me. It lifted me out of the negative mindset I was in, and it got me playing again. I thank him forever for that.

McCready gradually went back to playing guitar and finally joined another band called Love Chile. A childhood friend, Stone Gossard, went to one of the band&#x27;s shows and appreciated McCready&#x27;s work after hearing him perform Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot;. Gossard had known McCready before high school when the two would trade rock band pictures with each other. After the demise of Gossard&#x27;s band Mother Love Bone, he asked McCready if he wanted to play music together with him. After practicing with Gossard for a few months, McCready encouraged Gossard to reconnect with his fellow Mother Love Bone alum, Jeff Ament.

===Temple of the Dog===

The trio were attempting to form their own band when they were invited to be part of the Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden&#x27;s Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone&#x27;s frontman Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose at age 24. Cornell had been Wood&#x27;s roommate. The band&#x27;s line-up was completed by the addition of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron.

The band started rehearsing songs that Cornell had written on tour prior to Wood&#x27;s death, as well as re-working some existing material from demos written by Gossard and Ament. This was McCready&#x27;s first recording studio experience, and he took a central role in the project. McCready performed an epic four-minute-plus solo for &quot;Reach Down&quot;. According to Cornell, McCready&#x27;s headphone monitors flew off halfway through the recording of the solo, and he played the rest of the solo without being able to hear the backing track. McCready considers this track to be one of his proudest moments. The Temple of the Dog project eventually featured vocalist Eddie Vedder. (Vedder had come to Seattle to audition to be the singer for Ament and Gossard&#x27;s next band, which later became Pearl Jam.) Vedder sang a duet with Cornell on the song &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and provided background vocals on several other songs. The band decided that it had enough material for an entire album, and in April 1991 &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; was released through A&amp;M Records.

===Pearl Jam===
Pearl Jam was formed in 1990 by Ament, Gossard, and McCready, who then recruited Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band originally took the name Mookie Blaylock, but was forced to change it when the band signed to Epic Records in 1991. After the recording sessions for &quot;Ten&quot; were completed, Krusen left Pearl Jam in May 1991. Krusen was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the &quot;Alive&quot; video, Chamberlain left to join the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band. As his replacement, Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese, who joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting the &quot;Ten&quot; album.

&quot;Ten&quot; broke the band into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s. The band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge. McCready frequently soloed, and added a blues touch to the music (influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan). The single &quot;Jeremy&quot; received Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock Performance in 1993. Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its music video for &quot;Jeremy&quot;, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video. &quot;Ten&quot; was ranked number 207 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; was ranked number 11 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest songs of the &#x27;90s.

Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, &quot;Vs.&quot;, released in 1993. Upon its release, &quot;Vs.&quot; set at the time the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Vs.&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. From &quot;Vs.&quot;, the song &quot;Daughter&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the song &quot;Go&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.
Feeling the pressures of success, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band&#x27;s ability to tour in the United States. Later that same year the band released its third studio album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s third straight album to reach multi-platinum status. The album received Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album in 1996. &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was ranked number 492 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The lead single &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Although Abbruzzese performed on the album &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, he was fired in August 1994, four months before the album was released. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, he disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The band subsequently released &quot;No Code&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Yield&quot; in 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam enlisted former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron as Irons&#x27; replacement, initially on a temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement. &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was released on the band&#x27;s 1998 fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single.

In 2000, the band released its sixth studio album, &quot;Binaural&quot;, and initiated a successful and ongoing series of official bootlegs. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time. &quot;Grievance&quot; (from &quot;Binaural&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released its seventh studio album, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, in 2002. Pearl Jam&#x27;s contribution to the 2003 film, &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2004. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, the eponymous &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, was released in 2006. The band followed it with &quot;Backspacer&quot; (2009), &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; (2013), and &quot;Gigaton&quot; (2020).

==Other musical projects==
===Mad Season===

During the production of &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, McCready went into rehabilitation in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he met bassist John Baker Saunders of The Lamont Cranston Band. In 1994, when the two returned to Seattle, they formed a side band, The Gacy Bunch, with vocalist Layne Staley of Alice in Chains and drummer Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees. After several live shows, they changed their name to Mad Season. The band released the album &quot;Above&quot; through Columbia Records in 1995, and are best known for the single &quot;River of Deceit&quot;. The band broke up following Saunders&#x27; death in 1999 due to a heroin overdose. Staley would pass away three years later in 2002, of an apparent overdose of heroin and cocaine.

On February 28, 2010, McCready performed at the &quot;Hootenanny For Haiti&quot; at the Showbox at the Market in Seattle along with the likes of Velvet Revolver, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan, Fastbacks bassist Kim Warnick, Loaded and former Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister and Vendetta Red bassist Jeff Rouse as well as Truly and former Screaming Trees drummer Mark Pickerel among others.

A number of songs were covered during the show, including Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; among others however one of the more notable covers came when McCready performed a cover of &quot;River of Deceit&quot; for the first time since the breakup of Mad Season with Jeff Rouse performing vocal duties on the song.

&quot;Above&quot; was re-released in a 3-disc deluxe edition in 2013, and also in vinyl format featuring three new songs with Mark Lanegan on vocals.

In 2015, &quot;Live at the Moore 1995&quot; was released on 12&quot; vinyl to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the band&#x27;s final show. Earlier in 2015, the surviving members, McCready and Martin, joined with the Seattle Symphony in a concert at Benaroya Hall entitled &quot;Sonic Evolution&quot; featuring special guests and friends. The show was later released on CD/12&quot; vinyl.

===&quot;Mirror Ball&quot;===

McCready performed with other members of Pearl Jam on Neil Young&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, and subsequently took part in an eleven-date tour in Europe as part of Young&#x27;s backing band. This tour proved very successful with Young&#x27;s manager Elliot Roberts calling it &quot;One of the greatest tours we ever had in our whole lives&quot;.

===The Rockfords===

McCready played with another side band called The Rockfords, named after one of McCready&#x27;s favorite TV shows &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. The band features McCready&#x27;s former high school friends from Shadow, plus vocalist Carrie Akre of Goodness. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut was released on Epic Records in 2000. In 2021 the band secured the rights to their debut album, and released it on digital platforms in 2022.

===Solo album===
In a 2009 interview with San Diego radio station KBZT, McCready revealed that he was working on a solo album.

===Walking Papers===
McCready played guitar in the band Walking Papers, which included then-former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan, Screaming Trees/Mad Season drummer Barrett Martin, and singer Jeff Angell. The band released an album in August 2013.

===Levee Walkers===
In 2016 a new McCready project involving Duff McKagan, Barrett Martin and Jaz Coleman called The Levee Walkers released two songs on McCready&#x27;s label HockeyTalkter Records. In 2017 the group released the song &quot;All Things Fade Away&quot; featuring singer Ayron Jones.

==Musical style and influences==

McCready prefers to play &quot;by ear&quot; rather than from a technical standpoint. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m so ignorant of this technical stuff.&quot; When asked to explain the intricacies of Pearl Jam&#x27;s hit-making writing process, McCready says that &quot;I&#x27;ve always done it by ear. Honestly, I&#x27;d rather do regular interviews. It&#x27;s more interesting to talk about whatever… anything other than guitars. I&#x27;m not into being a tech-head.&quot; McCready&#x27;s guitar style is usually of an aggressive bluesy nature, and was described by Greg Prato of Allmusic as &quot;feel-oriented&quot; and &quot;rootsy&quot;. McCready has cited Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, David Gilmour, Keith Richards, Pete Townshend and Eddie Van Halen as his biggest musical influences.
McCready is also a die-hard Rolling Stones fan, and has described the band as his favorite of all time. Additionally, he cites Heart as an influence.

McCready is known to use a Fender Stratocaster, a Gibson Les Paul, and a Gibson Les Paul Junior. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the &quot;Vitalogy&quot; era. McCready said in 2006, &quot;Even though there are three guitars, I think there&#x27;s maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.&quot; Of his live performances, McCready has said, &quot;I can kind of get into a meditative state when I&#x27;m playing, something I don&#x27;t get any other way ... You might see me staring up in the sky with my eyes closed. I&#x27;m not faking it. That just kind of happens.&quot;

As time has gone on McCready has contributed more to Pearl Jam&#x27;s songwriting process. McCready&#x27;s first writing contribution for Pearl Jam was co-writing the music for the B-side &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; (from the &quot;Jeremy&quot; single), which has since become a regular set closing song during Pearl Jam&#x27;s live concerts. After co-writing material for &quot;Vs.&quot; and writing the music for the song &quot;Present Tense&quot; from the album &quot;No Code&quot;, he wrote the music for three of the tracks on the band&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;Yield&quot;, including one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;Given to Fly&quot;. All but one (&quot;Force of Nature&quot;, from &quot;Backspacer&quot;) of McCready&#x27;s sole compositions for Pearl Jam use alternate tunings, such as open G on &quot;Faithfull&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;), a variation of open D on &quot;Given to Fly&quot;, and a variation of open G on &quot;Marker in the Sand&quot; (from &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;). McCready made his first lyrical contribution for the band with the track &quot;Inside Job&quot;, which closes the band&#x27;s 2006 self-titled album.

==Equipment==
McCready is known to use a variety of different guitars, but during Pearl Jam&#x27;s early years he used mainly Fender Stratocasters. His arsenal now includes Gibson Les Pauls and Gibson Les Paul Juniors, among others.

A Fender Stratocaster has been used constantly and most often throughout his career. McCready has used many types of Stratocasters, vintage and modern, even including left-handed Stratocasters with reversed strings, so that the slanted bridge pickup would have more treble on the lower strings, as opposed to the intended higher strings. This was a common practice of Jimi Hendrix, who played right-handed guitars even though he was left-handed. His most prized model is a slab rosewood fretboard 1960 Stratocaster, the first in a series of 1959 modeled vintage guitars, inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Number One&quot; guitar.
In 2021, Fender Custom Shop master builder Vincent Van Trigt discovered that McCready&#x27;s valuable 1959 Stratocaster turned out to be a 1960 model. That same year, Fender produced a Custom Shop limited edition of the Mike McCready 1960 Stratocaster which is an accurate replica of McCready&#x27;s original sunburst.
In 2023, Fender also produced a Made in Mexico, more affordable signature model of McCready&#x27;s prized 1960 Stratocaster.

McCready&#x27;s second most used guitar is a Gibson Les Paul. He now uses it for live performances of &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Brain of J.&quot; (from &quot;Yield&quot;), and &quot;Given to Fly&quot;, among others. Among his collection, his most frequently used is his 1959 Standard, formerly owned by Jim Armstrong, guitarist for Van Morrison&#x27;s band, Them. He has only recently started to use the single pickup Gibson Les Paul Junior, which is a TV yellow 1959 model. He also has Gibson Les Paul Specials. He plays Fender Telecasters on live performances of &quot;Corduroy&quot; (from &quot;Vitalogy&quot;), &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; (from &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;), and &quot;Marker in the Sand&quot;, among others.
Gibson produced a signature, limited edition version of McCready&#x27;s 1959 original Les Paul Standard with true historic specifications.

==Recognition==
In a review of Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2006 eponymous album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Fricke admitted that he &quot;screwed up&quot; in excluding both McCready and Pearl Jam rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard from the publication&#x27;s 2003 feature &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2007, McCready&#x27;s guitar solos from &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; were featured on &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; list. In February 2007, McCready and Gossard were included together by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in its list of &quot;The Top 20 New Guitar Gods&quot; under the title of &quot;four-armed monster&quot;.&quot; He was placed at #6 on a list of &quot;The Twenty-Five Most Underrated Guitarists&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Adding to that, he was ranked on #1 in &quot;Ultimate Guitar&#x27;s&quot; list of the most underrated guitarist of all time. He was also named the highest-paid guitarist in the world, earning a net of more than $82 million in 2021 (though predominantly through avenues other than music). In 2023, McCready and Gossard were both included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &#x27;s &quot;The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; list at #124.

On May 10, 2018, McCready was honored with the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his dedication to and support of MusiCares and his commitment to helping others in the addiction recovery process.

==Personal life==
McCready and his wife Ashley O&#x27;Connor are the parents of three children. The couple lived in Seattle, Washington as of 2005.

McCready suffers from Crohn&#x27;s disease, which he was diagnosed with at the age of 21, and has worked to bring awareness of the disease. He endorsed President Barack Obama specifically for his health care program, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which mandated health insurance be available to those with pre-existing conditions. In 2012, McCready made &quot;Life is a Pre-existing Condition,&quot; a video about the importance of nationalized healthcare. McCready performs an annual concert to benefit the Northwest chapter of the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of America, and has played at the event in a UFO tribute band called Flight to Mars as well as a reunited Shadow line-up.

McCready&#x27;s favorite literary author is John Steinbeck and his favorite book of all time is &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

McCready is also an avid sports fan and a lifelong supporter of Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Mariners and Seattle Sounders FC.

===Substance abuse===
Like many others from the Seattle grunge scene, McCready has had two different bouts with substance abuse. The first came during the production of Pearl Jam&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, when McCready was fighting drug and alcohol addiction:
We had a lot of meetings where they would say, &#x27;Hey Mike, you&#x27;re getting way too fucked up.&#x27; But we&#x27;re all really good friends and we love each other and I think they actually thought I was going to die, but they never took steps to kick me out of the band, which I can&#x27;t believe because I fucked up so many times. I was drunk and making an ass out of myself and they were concerned about it. ... I&#x27;d clean up for a little while then I&#x27;d fall off the wagon, like addicts do. ... When everything blew up, everybody kind of lost their minds. ... I was clean for about a month ... well, semi-clean; I can&#x27;t bullshit about that ... but I fell off the wagon after the Kurt Cobain thing. That fucked with everybody really hard. I mean, how do you get to that point of depression where suicide&#x27;s the only way out?

McCready&#x27;s second bout came during the sessions for Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Binaural&quot;:
I was going through some personal problems. It was my own stuff I was dealing with. That was a tough time. I was out of it. That was due, at the time, I was taking prescription drugs. I got caught up in it, because of my pain.

===Charity contributions===
McCready was a part of the effort to raise money for Roger Federer&#x27;s charity, Roger Federer Foundation as a part of Match for Africa – a non competitive tennis event held to a packed Key Arena in Seattle on April 29, 2017. In this event, McCready teamed with John Isner, and competed against Roger Federer and philanthropist Bill Gates. Federer and Gates won the game 6–4. McCready also donates to the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation regularly, participating in their flag football tournaments.

=== Photography ===
In 2017, McCready published a book of Polaroids he shot during his time in Pearl Jam, dating back to the early 1990s. Titled &quot;Of Potato Heads and Polaroids: My Life Inside and Out of Pearl Jam,&quot; and published by powerHouse books, McCready described the book as &quot;an emotional ride&quot;. The photos in it document the band on tour, fellow musicians including Neil Young, Dave Grohl, Joey Ramone, and Jimmy Page, and McCready&#x27;s personal life.

<text>James W. Johnston (29 August 1792 – 21 November 1873) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He served as Premier of the colony from 1857 to 1860 and again from 1864. He was also &quot;Government Leader&quot; prior to the granting of responsible government in 1848. He was a Conservative and supporter of Confederation. Johnston was a descendant of Loyalists who fled the United States during the revolutionary war. Johnston was a member of the Tory establishment in Nova Scotia. In 1837, he was appointed to the Legislative Council and while he sometimes supported reform, he was generally a critic and opponent of responsible government and the introduction of party government.
In 1843, he left the Legislative Council to run for the elected legislative assembly and became &quot;government leader&quot; because of the support of moderate members who opposed the &quot;extremism&quot; of Joseph Howe but were willing to make some concessions.

He lost power when responsible government was instituted in 1848 but continued as leader of what became the Conservative Party and served as Premier from 1857 to 1860 and again from 1863 to 1864 before being appointed to the bench.

Johnston was an early supporter of Canadian confederation, seeing it as a means of correcting the failings of responsible government.

<text>Rave Master, Rave, and alternatively, The Groove Adventure Rave in Japan, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima. The series follows Haru Glory, a teenager on a quest to find the five fragments of the sacred stone of light Rave (renamed from &quot;Holy Bring&quot;) in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length.

The manga was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from July 1999 to July 2005, with its chapters collected in 35 volumes. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a 51-episode anime television series by Studio Deen, which was broadcast on TBS from October 2001 to September 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation, which was broadcast in the United States on Cartoon Network from June 2004 to July 2005.

By 2020, the manga had 23.5 million copies in circulation.

==Plot==

In 0015, the world is corrupted by Dark Brings, evil stones that bestow powerful magic with different abilities to their owners. The Dark Brings are used by the Raregroove Kingdom, which is opposed by the Symphonia Kingdom with the five Rave stones. Shiba Roses, the Rave Master, attempts to destroy Sinclaire, the &quot;mother&quot; of all of the Dark Brings, with the Ten Commandments sword. However, the aftermath causes a massive explosion known as Overdrive, destroying one-tenth of the known world. Shiba, protected from the disaster by his special guardian &quot;dog&quot; Plue, holds onto the Rave required to power his sword. Plue and the four remaining Raves, however, get scattered around the world.

Fifty years later, sixteen-year-old Haru Glory lives on the peaceful Garage Island with his older sister, Cattleya. Shortly after Haru accidentally fishes Plue up, Shiba arrives wishing to reclaim Plue, but a group from the terrorist organization Demon Card arrives to kill Shiba. Shiba recognizes Haru as the second Rave Master, entrusting the Ten Commandments, Plue, and his Rave to him. Seeking power to defeat Demon Card, Haru and Plue set off on a journey to find the missing Rave stones. Upon arriving at the mainland, Haru gradually amasses a group of friends and allies, including an amnesiac girl named Elie, who harbors a magical energy known as Etherion within her body. During his showdown with Demon Card&#x27;s leader, Gale &quot;King&quot; Raregroove, Haru reunites with his absent father, Gale Glory, who helps him defeat King, but sacrifices himself to save his son from the destruction of King&#x27;s headquarters.

Some time later, Demon Card is reestablished by King&#x27;s son, Lucia, who wishes to capture Elie to use Etherion. While facing Demon Card, Haru&#x27;s group learns of a mythical creature known as Endless, which threatens mankind by provoking another Overdrive, and can only be destroyed with Etherion. Using all Sinclaires, Lucia absorbs Endless with the goal of destroying the world, which is actually a parallel dimension created by his ancestor after the original was ruined by a plague, cursing his family as a result. To avoid another Overdrive, Haru and his friends oppose Lucia and his strongest forces at the mystical Star Memory. Although Haru defeats Lucia, he is absorbed by Endless and convinces Elie to destroy it at the apparent cost of his life. One year later, Elie has lost her memories of Haru, and she and the others visit his grave. Haru appears alive thanks to the Star Memory&#x27;s magic and reunites with Elie, who then remembers him. The warriors go their separate ways, with Haru and Elie returning to Garage Island to live together.

==Development==

Hiro Mashima created &quot;Rave Master&quot; with the idea of travelling around the world. Composed of thirty-five &quot;volumes&quot;, Mashima comments that although it was sometimes difficult to think of how to develop the storyline, he still remembers enjoying the making of &quot;Rave Master&quot;. Additionally, he regards that the series&#x27; end was &quot;a little sentimental, a little sad.&quot; In early chapters Mashima had multiple difficulties with the series&#x27; backgrounds. Nevertheless, across the volumes Mashima realized how the art was evolving resulting in most appealing pages. During publication, &quot;Rave Master&quot; was supposed to end in its ninth volume with King and Demon Card&#x27;s defeat and all of the plot&#x27;s mysteries resolved. This was planned since Mashima had the desire to make a new manga. In the end, he decided to continue with &quot;Rave Master&quot; following King&#x27;s arc after finding such an ending too contrived.

In both &quot;Rave Master&quot; and his other manga &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;, Mashima wants to make justice prevail but also make readers understand the villains&#x27; reasons to fight the main character in order to make them more complex characters. In some cases, Mashima admitted having writer&#x27;s block as he did not plan the abilities of certain characters with some readers referring to the Dark Brings as &quot;too convenient.&quot; The protagonist, Haru, was designed prior to developing the story as he was a male character Mashima always wanted to draw. His sidekick, Plue, was also designed much earlier when he was in high school. Plue was given his own sidestory much to Mashima&#x27;s surprise because of the funny looking characters designed for a &quot;shonen&quot; magazine.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima, &quot;Rave Master&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from July 6, 1999, to July 27, 2005. Its 296 chapters were published in thirty-five volumes by Kodansha, released from November 17, 1999, to September 16, 2005. The series was later rereleased in eighteen volumes between August 10, 2006, and April 12, 2007.

&quot;Rave Master&quot; was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop, which released 32 volumes of the series. On August 31, 2009, Tokyopop announced that they would not be completing the series as their licenses with Kodansha expired and Kodansha required that they immediately stop publication of all previously licensed series, including &quot;Rave Master&quot;. The next month, it was announced that Del Rey Manga had acquired the license and would begin publishing the remaining volumes in 2010. The last three volumes were published in a single omnibus volume. Del Rey never released the earlier volumes before their license expired. In 2017 Kodansha USA licensed the series for release in digital format, and released all volumes on October 3 of that same year. &quot;Rave Master&quot; was also one of the first manga series released in Spanish in North America by Public Square Books.

In 2011, Mashima authored a crossover one-shot between &quot;Rave Master&quot; and &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;. It was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Magazine Special&quot; May issue. Another crossover manga between &quot;Rave Master&quot;, &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;, and &quot;Edens Zero&quot; was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from October 16 to December 25, 2019.

===Anime===

The series was adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series, entitled &quot;Groove Adventure Rave&quot;, by Studio Deen. It was directed by Takashi Watanabe and the music was composed by Kenji Kawai. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001, and ran until September 28, 2002. The anime series is based on the first twelve volumes of the manga series. The series was also collected in a total of seventeen DVD volumes between February 6, 2002, and June 4, 2003.

Tokyopop licensed the series for release and broadcast in North America. As with the manga, Tokyopop released the series under the name &quot;Rave Master&quot;. Rita Majkut produced the English-language version, which edited the series for its content and length and given an alternate musical score composed by Glenn Scott Lacey. The dub was recorded at Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Recording Studio in Burbank. The ADR writer was Bob Buchholz, and Marc Handler was the voice director for all of the episodes. The dub aired on Cartoon Network in the United States, premiering in June 2004 as part of the Toonami programming block. The series&#x27; second half began airing on January 22, 2005. It was also on the &quot;MiGUZi&quot; weekday afternoon after-school action block and its Sunday Morning daytime lineup of Summer 2005. Syfy would begun airing the series on March 16, 2009, as part of its &quot;Ani-Monday&quot; programming block, where it ran until its conclusion on September 21, 2009. Tokyopop released three DVD volumes of the series and in 2010 it collected the entire series.

The one-shot crossover between &quot;Rave Master&quot; and &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; was adapted into an original video animation with Mashima himself acting as supervisor to the project and had expanded the original chapter to include more characters from &quot;Rave Master&quot;. It was released on August 16, 2013, alongside the thirty-ninth volume of &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;.

===CDs===
The Japanese audio by Kenji Kawai was released in a total of four CD soundtracks by King Records. Geneon also published a CD based on the Japanese soundtrack for English release under the title of &quot;Rave Master: Music Side&quot;.

===Video games===
There are six video games based on &quot;Rave Master&quot; published by Konami. Three games were released for the PlayStation including the role-playing games &quot;Groove Adventure Rave&quot; and its sequel , and platforming game &quot;Plue no Daibouken from Groove Adventure Rave&quot;.

For Nintendo&#x27;s consoles Konami released both &quot;Groove Adventure Rave&quot; and &quot;Rave Master: Special Attack Force!&quot; (&quot;Groove Adventure Rave: Hikari to Yami no Daikessen 2&quot;), two fighting games for the Game Boy Advance, and &quot;Rave Master&quot;, which was released on the GameCube.

==Reception==
The &quot;Rave Master&quot; manga has been well received with its Western release appearing in Diamond Comic Distributors&#x27;s graphic novels charts. The manga and anime series also received positive impressions from Jason Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, giving the series a positive review of 3 out of 4 stars. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment also enjoyed the series recommending people to buy multiple volumes rather than one to enjoy the connected story arcs. He praised the series&#x27; fight scenes coupled with the emotional content that makes the series worth reading. UK Anime Network writer Rory Carlyle shared similar comments as he viewed the series to be &quot;pretty good&quot; despite having common standards seen in multiple manga. Carlyle was surprised by the multiple character designs that included humanoid and superdeformed characters besides common ones like Haru. The artwork was also praised by Anime News Network&#x27;s Allen Divers who referred to the series as &quot;a try before you buy&quot; based on the simple storyline.

The anime series was praised by Anime News Network and DVDTalk for its animation, although its fight scenes received a negative response. In addition, Tokyopop&#x27;s English dub for the series garnered significant criticism for its script rewrites, voice acting, and soundtrack. Both reviewers found that the series was better suited towards a young audience but expected an uncut version of the anime to attract older fans.

By 2020, the manga had 23.5 million copies in circulation.

<text>Dihydroxyacetone (; DHA), also known as glycerone, is a simple saccharide (a triose) with formula .

DHA is primarily used as an ingredient in sunless tanning products. It is often derived from plant sources such as sugar beets and sugar cane, and by the fermentation of glycerin.

==Chemistry==
DHA is a hygroscopic white crystalline powder. It has a sweet cooling taste and a characteristic odor. It is the simplest of all ketoses and has no chiral center. The normal form is a dimer (2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,4-dioxane-2,5-diol). The dimer slowly dissolves in water, whereupon it converts to the monomer. These solutions are stable at pH&#x27;s between 4 and 6. In more basic solution, it degrades to brown product. 

This skin browning effect is attributed to a Maillard reaction. DHA condenses with the amino acid residues in the protein keratin, the major component of the skin surface. When injected, no pigmentation occurs, consistent with a role for oxygen in color development. The resulting pigments, which can be removed by abrasion, are called melanoidins. These are similar in coloration to melanin, the natural substance in the deeper skin layers which brown or &quot;tan&quot; from exposure to UV rays.

==Biochemistry==
Its phosphorylated form, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), takes part in glycolysis, and it is an intermediate product of fructose metabolism.

==Preparation==
DHA may be prepared, along with glyceraldehyde, by the mild oxidation of glycerol, for example with hydrogen peroxide and a ferrous salt as catalyst. It can also be prepared in high yield and selectivity at room temperature from glycerol using cationic palladium-based catalysts with oxygen, air or benzoquinone acting as co-oxidants. Glyceraldehyde is a structural isomer of dihydroxyacetone.

DHA can be derived from plants.

==Sunless tanning==

DHA is the main active ingredient in many sunless tanning skincare preparations, which may be classified as &quot;topical sunless tanner&quot; or &quot;temporary bronzers&quot;.
As opposed to bronzers containing pigment to coat the skin, DHA bronzers cause a coloration of the surface layer of the skin and do not wash off easily.
Current sunless tanners are formulated into sprays, lotions, gels, mousses, and cosmetic wipes. Professional applied products include spray tanning booths, airbrush tan applications, and hand applied lotions, gels, mousses and wipes.
Lotions often last longer than sprays but may cause blotching and streaking. Mousses and gels tend to dry faster. Mousses generally contain less moisture.

Lotion manufacturers also produce a wide variety of sunless tanning preparations that replace DHA with natural bronzing agents such as black walnut shell. DHA may be used alone or combined with other tanning components such as erythrulose. DHA is considered the most effective sun-free tanning additive.

Sunless tanning products contain DHA in concentrations ranging from 1% to 20%. Most drugstore products range from 3% to 5%, with professional products ranging from 5% to 20%. The percentages correspond with the product coloration levels from light to dark. Lighter products are more beginner-friendly, but may require multiple coats to produce the desired color depth. Darker products produce a dark tan in one coat, but are also more prone to streaking, unevenness, or off-color tones. The artificial tan takes 2 to 4 hours to begin appearing on the skin surface, and will continue to darken for 24 to 72 hours, depending on formulation type.

Once the darkening effect has occurred, the tan will not sweat off or wash away with soap or water. It will fade gradually over 3 to 7 days as a result of the regular skin exfoliation. Scrubbing the skin, prolonged water submersion, or heavy sweating can lighten the tan, as these all contribute to rapid dead skin cell exfoliation (the dead skin cells are the tinted portion of the sunless tan).

It is recommended to shave, wash, or exfoliate the skin before application in order to produce a more even tan.
The skin should not be moisturized before application except very dry areas. Application should be done evenly with a circular motion. 

Bronzers contain DHA in concentrations from 1 to 15% allowing to adjust the intensity of coloration. DHA formulations have improved in several ways since the introduction in the 1960s. 

=== Safe use and side effects ===
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved DHA for topical application on the skin, but not for contact with eyes, lips, and mucous membranes. DHA may not be used in spray tanning booths due to risk of exposure of these sensitive areas. 

DHA-containing spray tans have been associated to side effects such as rashes, cough, dizziness, and fainting. Frequent exposure to spray tans may increase the risk of pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer. 

The chemical reaction of DHA in the skin may lead to an unpleasant smell. Fragrances are often added to the formulation to mask the smell, which may lead to allergic reactions or worsen asthma symptoms. Some products contain parabens as chemical preservatives that can cause rosacea and allergic contact dermatitis and act as weak estrogens. 

Frequent use of DHA containing products may to be problematic due to a number of side effects. 
A FDA report concluded that 11 percent of the applied DHA may penetrate into the living cells of the epidermis and dermis. A previous study linked DHA to DNA damage, cell-cycle block, and apoptosis in living cells. 
Skin coloring induced by frequent use of DHA may interfere with vitamin D production in the skin cells which depends on the exposure to UVB in sunlight. 
Topical DHA use in levels of more than 5% seem to increase free-radical damage from sunlight for 24 hours after application. Antioxidants may be added to the formulation to produce a more natural tan, and may potentially counteract free radical damage. The use of sunless tanning products may increase the likelihood of sunburn as the artificial coloration of the skin interferes with the natural adaption of the skin to sun exposure. The tanning induced by DHA has been rated with a low sun protection factor (SPF) of 3. It can therefore not replace the application of a regular sunscreen before exposing the skin to intensive sunlight.

Erythrulose is a similar agent contained in red raspberries that produces a short-lived reddish tan. The general tanning effect is usually improved when used in combination with DHA. Erythrulose also increases the occurrence of free radicals.

DHA may be contained in moisturizers with added fruit extracts sold as &quot;maximizers&quot;.
Tanning agents labelled as &quot;tingles&quot; contain benzyl nicotinate which presumably aids the production of melanin by increasing blood circulation in the skin, thus supplying more oxygen to melanocytes, and often induces a burning or tingling feeling. 
The effect of products called &quot;optimizers&quot; or &quot;accelerators&quot; containing the protein tyrosine as a precursor in the production of melanin is disputed.

===History===
DHA was first recognized as a skin coloring agent by German scientists in the 1920s. Through its use in the X-ray process, it was noted as causing the skin surface to turn brown when spilled.

In the 1950s, Eva Wittgenstein at the University of Cincinnati did further research with dihydroxyacetone. Her studies involved using DHA as an oral drug for assisting children with glycogen storage disease. The children received large doses of DHA by mouth, and sometimes spat or spilled the substance onto their skin. Healthcare workers noticed that the skin turned brown after a few hours of DHA exposure. Wittgenstein continued to experiment with DHA, painting liquid solutions of it onto her own skin. She was able to consistently reproduce the pigmentation effect, and noted that DHA did not appear to penetrate beyond the stratum corneum, or dead skin surface layer (the FDA eventually concluded this is not entirely true). Research then continued on DHA&#x27;s skin coloring effect in relation to treatment for patients with vitiligo.

Coppertone introduced the first consumer sunless tanning lotion into the marketplace in the 1960s. This product was called &quot;Quick Tan&quot; or &quot;QT&quot;. It was sold as an overnight tanning agent, and other companies followed suit with similar products. Consumers soon tired of this product due to unattractive results such as orange palms, streaking and poor coloration. Because of the QT experience, many people still associate sunless tanning with fake-looking orange tans.

In the 1970s the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added DHA permanently to their list of approved cosmetic ingredients.

By the 1980s, new sunless tanning formulations appeared on the market and refinements in the DHA manufacturing process created products that produced a more natural looking color and better fading. Consumer concerns surrounding damage associated with UV tanning options (sunbathing, indoor tanning) spurred popularity of sunless tanning products as an alternative to UV tanning. Dozens of brands appeared on drugstore shelves, in numerous formulations.

==Winemaking==
Both acetic acid bacteria &quot;Acetobacter aceti&quot; and &quot;Gluconobacter oxydans&quot; use glycerol as a carbon source to form dihydroxyacetone. DHA is formed by ketogenesis of glycerol. It can affect the sensory quality of the wine with sweet/etherish properties. DHA can also react with proline to produce a &quot;crust-like&quot; aroma. Dihydroxyacetone can affect the anti-microbial activity in wine, as it has the ability to bind SO2.
