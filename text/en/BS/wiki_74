<text>The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction of 1997, known informally as the Ottawa Treaty, the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, or often simply the Mine Ban Treaty, aims at eliminating anti-personnel landmines (APLs) around the world.

By August 2022, 164 states had ratified or acceded to the treaty. Major powers, which are also past and current manufacturers of landmines, are not parties to the treaty. These include the United States, China, and Russia. Other non-signatories include India and Pakistan.

== Chronology ==










===Early action and draft Conventions===
















===Threats to the comprehensive nature of the Convention===

A major threat to the project of a Total ban Convention as endorsed by the 1996 Ottawa Conference was the danger of being watered down.

One example was the well-intended attempt made by Canada to win the support of Countries opposed to a total ban – in particular the US – by proposing a new approach: To replace the Draft Convention by a new text, composed of a &quot;Chapeau-Convention&quot;, containing generalities only, and four annexed protocols, each one dealing with one of the main prohibitions: production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines. This approach would allow some additional countries to join the process but at the price of allowing them to pick and choose only those prohibitions compatible with their military needs. This concept, which would keep only the appearance of a total ban treaty, would risk creating a confusing situation of varying legal situations, and would, in the first place, postpone a real comprehensive total ban, potentially indefinitely. This proposal did however not materialise as the US rebuffed the idea, believing that they could steer the negotiations into the Conference on Disarmament where it would be subject to the consensus rule.

===Attempts to block the project of a Total Ban Convention===

Countries opposing a total ban of APMs because of their military necessities had an interest to prevent any negotiations on a total ban and in particular in free standing negotiations as proposed by Austria. 
The smart way to achieve this aim was to insist on holding the relevant negotiations in the framework of the competent forum of the UN for disarmament negotiations, the Conference on Disarmament (CD). The catch is that the CD had many years previously become a dead end, because of fundamental disagreements among Member States on its agenda and because of the rule of consensus giving each member de facto the right of veto.

===Further progress===







 














== Implementation ==
=== Treaty terms ===
Besides ceasing the production and development of anti-personnel mines, a party to the treaty must destroy its stockpile of anti-personnel mines within four years, although it may retain a small number for training purposes (mine-clearance, detection, etc.). Within ten years after ratifying the treaty, the country should have cleared all of its mined areas. This is a difficult task for many countries, but at the annual meetings of the States Parties they may request an extension and assistance. The treaty also calls on States Parties to provide assistance to mine-affected persons in their own country and to provide assistance to other countries in meeting their treaty obligations.

The treaty covers only anti-personnel mines; it does not address mixed mines, anti-tank mines, remote-controlled claymore mines, anti-handling devices (booby traps), and other &quot;static&quot; explosive devices.

=== Destruction of stockpiles ===
Signatory nations have destroyed more than 48 million stockpiled mines since the treaty&#x27;s entry into force on 1 March 1999. As of June 2017, 159 countries had completed the destruction of their stockpiles or declared that they did not possess stockpiles to destroy. Sri Lanka reported in September 2021 that they had finished destroying their stockpile.

===Retention of landmines===
Article 3 of the treaty permits countries to retain landmines for use in training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques. 72 countries have taken this option. Of this group, 26 States Parties retain fewer than 1,000 mines. Only two have retained more than 10,000 mines: Turkey (15,100) and Bangladesh (12,500). A total of 83 States Parties have declared that they do not retain any antipersonnel mines, including 27 states that stockpiled antipersonnel mines in the past.
Canada retains mines for training, and also continues to make and use the &quot;C19 Detonated Weapon&quot; in combat. The latter does not qualify as a landmine under the treaty because it is fired by a person and not by a pressure plate.

=== Landmine-free countries ===
Through 2015, 29 countries had cleared all known mined areas from their territory: Albania, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Denmark, Djibouti, France, Gambia, Germany, Guinea-Bissau, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Jordan, Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Rwanda, Suriname, Swaziland, Tunisia, Uganda, and Venezuela. El Salvador finished clearing its landmines before joining the Treaty.

At the November–December 2009 Cartagena Summit for a Mine-Free World, Albania, Greece, Rwanda, and Zambia were also declared mine-free. On 2 December 2009, Rwanda was declared free of landmines. It followed a three-year campaign by 180 Rwandan soldiers, supervised by the Mine Awareness Trust and trained in Kenya, to remove over 9,000 mines laid in the country between 1990 and 1994. The soldiers checked and cleared 1.3 square km of land in twenty minefields. The official Cartagena Summit announcement came after the Rwandan Ministry of Defence&#x27;s own announcement of the completion of the demining process on 29 November 2009. Under Article 5 of the Ottawa Treaty, Rwanda was requested to become mine-free by 1 December 2010.

On 18 June 2010, Nicaragua was declared free of landmines.

Two more countries became free of landmines in 2011. On 14 June 2011, Nepal was declared a landmine-free zone, making it the second country to be landmine-free in Asia. In December 2011, Burundi was declared landmine free.

On 5 December 2012 at the 12th Meeting of the States Parties, six states declared themselves landmine-free. These were the Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Jordan, and Uganda.

On 17 September 2015, Mozambique was declared free of land mines after the last of some nearly 171,000 had been cleared over 20 years.

The last land mines in the Falkland Islands were removed by 2020. 

== Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor ==
The Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor (&quot;the Monitor&quot;) is an initiative providing research for the ICBL and the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC), and acting as their de facto monitoring regime.

As an initiative of ICBL which was founded in 1998 through Human Rights Watch, the Monitor gives monitoring on the humanitarian development and uses of landmines, cluster munitions, and explosive remnants of war (ERW). It provides reports on all aspects of the landmine, cluster munitions, and ERW issues. It issues annual report updates on all countries in the world, keeps an international network with experts, provides research findings for all mediums, and remains flexible to adapt its reports to any changes. The Monitor has earned respect with its transparency whose states must be provided under the relevant treaties for independent reporting. Its main audiences are not only governments, NGOs, and other international organizations, but also media, academics and the public.

== States parties ==

The Convention gained 122 country signatures when it opened for signing on 3 December 1997 in Ottawa, Canada. Currently, there are 164 States Parties to the Treaty. Thirty-two countries have not signed the treaty and one more has signed but did not ratify. The states that have not signed the treaty includes a majority of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: China, the United States, and Russia. In 2014, the United States declared that it will abide by the terms of the Treaty, except for landmines used on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea, like North Korea, has not signed the treaty, believing the use of landmines to be crucial to the defense of their territory against the other.

==Responses==
===Supportive===
Pope Francis has described the Ottawa Process as an example of where the organisations of &quot;civil society&quot; are &quot;capable of creating effective dynamics that the United Nations cannot&quot;.

===Critical===
Criticism from academics, security officials, and diplomats is based on both the political process and the substance. The campaign for what became the Ottawa Treaty was led by a group of powerful non-governmental organizations, and instead of working within existing multilateral frameworks, including the Conference on Disarmament, based at the UN compound in Geneva (the Palais des Nations), an ad hoc framework was created that detoured around existing intergovernmental processes. Critics alleged that this represented a challenge to the sovereignty and responsibility of nation states for the defense of their citizens.

Substantively, critics view the treaty as naive and idealistic, in attempting to erase the reality of security threats that lead armies and defense forces to rely on landmines for protection against invasion and terror attacks. As a result, ratification has been far from universal, and many of the states that do not currently intend to ratify the treaty possess large stockpiles of anti-personnel mines. So far 35 countries have not signed the treaty; nonsignatories include the United States, Russia, China, Myanmar, United Arab Emirates, Cuba, Egypt, India, Israel, and Iran.

Opponents of banning anti-personnel mines give several reasons, among them that mines are a cheap and therefore cost-effective area denial weapon. Opponents claim that when used correctly, anti-personnel mines are defensive weapons that harm only attackers, unlike ranged weapons such as ballistic missiles that are most effective if used for preemptive attacks. Furthermore, opponents claim that the psychological effect of mines increases the threshold to attack and thus reduces the risk of war.

The Ottawa Treaty does not cover all types of unexploded ordnance. Cluster bombs, for example, introduce the same problem as mines: unexploded bomblets can remain a hazard for civilians long after a conflict has ended. A separate Convention on Cluster Munitions was drafted in 2008 and was adopted and entered into force in 2010. As of February 2022, there are 110 state parties of the CCM. In theory, mines could be replaced by manually triggered Claymore mines, but this requires the posting of a sentry.

Opponents point out that the Ottawa Convention places no restriction whatsoever on anti-vehicle mines which kill civilians on tractors, on school buses, etc. The position of the United States is that the inhumane nature of landmines stems not from whether they are anti-personnel as opposed to anti-vehicle but from their persistence. The United States has unilaterally committed to never using persistent landmines of any kind, whether anti-personnel or anti-vehicle, which they say is a more comprehensive humanitarian measure than the Ottawa Convention. All US landmines now self-destruct in two days or less, in most cases four hours. While the self-destruct mechanism has never failed in more than 65,000 random tests, if self-destruct were to fail the mine will self-deactivate because its battery will run down in two weeks or less. That compares with persistent anti-vehicle mines which remain lethal for about 30 years and are legal under the Ottawa Convention.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, a group of 20 MPs in the Parliament of Estonia from the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia, headed by the former Chief of Defence Ants Laaneots presented a bill to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty on October 2022. This was however met with reluctance by the Estonian Ministry of Defence, whose spokesman Thomas Mell claimed that there&#x27;s no indication that Estonia would need to reintroduce anti-personnel mines, and the bill was voted down by the parliament. After the USA approved transfers of anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine on 19 November 2024 and the discussion on anti-personnel landmines was again opened in the neighbouring Finland on 23 November 2024, the parliamentary National Defence Committee did the same in Estonia, referring to cooperation with the US and Finland. The Estonian Ministry of Defence responded that the situation has changed, and asked the Estonian Defence Forces to provide up-to-date advice on the military aspects of the matter, as well as placing an emphasis on the foreign relations aspect of possible withdrawal.

====Finland====
In Finland, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party proposed withdrawing from the treaty in 2014, Finland having entered the treaty just two years prior. The stance is supported by the Finnish Ministry of Defence report from 2003, which sees landmines as an effective weapon against a mechanised invasion force. In early 2018, an MP from the National Coalition Party started a citizens&#x27; initiative to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty. Also, the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (Blue Reform; formerly Finns Party prior to its split) has been supporting withdrawal from the treaty, saying that he &quot;wants to rip it in half&quot;.

Since the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the debate sparked up again in Finland, when the chairmans of the National Coalition Party Petteri Orpo and Finns Party Riikka Purra viewed joining the treaty as a mistake in a panel of the Finnish national broadcaster Yle on 1 March 2022, wanting to resign from the treaty. According to a questionnaire sent to Finnish parliamentary groups by a consortium of local newspapers Uutissuomalainen earlier during the invasion and published on 1 March 2022, the Finns Party (as well as its splinter group Power Belongs to the People), Christian Democrats and Movement Now supported resignation from the treaty, the National Coalition Party, Social Democratic Party and Left Alliance being undecided on the question, while the Centre Party, Green League and Swedish People&#x27;s Party on the side of supporting staying in the treaty. The President of Finland Sauli Niinistö also commented that &quot;there would be use for anti-personnel mines&quot;, and former Chief of Defence Gustav Hägglund considered joining the treaty &quot;a grave mistake&quot;. In the same continuum, another citizens&#x27; initiative to resign from the treaty, left on 24 February 2022, gathered the required 50,000 signatures by 6 March 2022, and proceeded to the Parliament. However, the initiative expired without vote. Debate in Finland sparked again after the new Chief of Defence Janne Jaakkola pushed for reconsideration of the policy on anti-personnel landmines on 23 November 2024, based on the course of events of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Following Jaakkola&#x27;s opener, three new citizens&#x27; initiatives were started for the withdrawal from the Ottawa Treaty, and the matter quickly started a widespread public discussion. The Centre Party now supported withdrawal from the treaty and the SPP were undecided, while the Left Alliance leaning towards staying in the treaty; other parties&#x27; opinions would stay as they were in early 2022; the two largest parties, NCP and SDP undecided and calling for a thorough new review and expert opinions from the Defence Forces. The leading newspaper in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat, speculated in their editorial on 26 November 2024 that there&#x27;s enough political support for the withdrawal, and that just as Finland&#x27;s reluctance to join the Ottawa Treaty was understood by Finland&#x27;s western partners, would a decision to withdraw be met with understanding, and that it would seem likely that Finland would be headed towards that.

====Lithuania====
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Lithuania began revisiting its defence policies. In December 2024, based on the military lessons from the Russian war against Ukraine, the outgoing Lithuanian Minister of National Defence initiated the debate on the withdrawal from the Ottawa Treaty. The Lithuanian government reasoned that the anti-personnel mines are an important capability and that Russia is neither the party of the convention nor it would hesitate to use such munitions in a conflict with NATO.

====Ukraine====
Ukraine has also signaled that it might have to withdraw from the treaty due to military necessity. Despite Ukraine having not officially withdrawn from the treaty, the president of the United States Joe Biden approved transfers of American anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine on 19 November 2024, eliciting criticism for the rejection of the treaty from human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International USA, despite HRW acknowledging the widespread use of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine by Russia, a non-signatory party to the Ottawa Treaty.

===Compliance===
Little progress in actual reduction of mine usage has been achieved. In 2011, the number of landmines dispersed is higher than ever since 2004, landmines being dispersed in Libya, Syria, and Myanmar.

Turkey reported that between 1957 and 1998, Turkish forces laid 615,419 antipersonnel mines along the Syrian border &quot;to prevent illegal border crossings&quot;. These mines are killing Syrians stuck on the border or trying to cross near Kobanî. Turkey is required under the treaty to destroy all antipersonnel mines, but has missed deadlines. Human Rights Watch claims in its report that as of 18 November 2014, over 2,000 civilians were still in the Tel Shair corridor section of the mine belt because Turkey had been refusing entry for cars or livestock, and the refugees did not want to leave behind their belongings.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine has become the first party of the treaty to violate it. In the war, Russia has also used landmines forbidden in the treaty, but it has not signed the treaty.

== United Nations General Assembly annual resolutions ==
A recurrent opportunity for States to indicate their support for the ban on antipersonnel mines is their vote on the annual UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution calling for universalization and full implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty. UNGA Resolution 66/29, for example, was adopted on 2 December 2011 by a vote of 162 in favor, none opposed, and 18 abstentions.

Since the first UNGA resolution supporting the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, the number of states voting in favor has ranged from a low of 139 in 1999 to a high of 165 in 2010. The number of states abstaining has ranged from a high of 23 in 2002 and 2003 to a low of 17 in 2005 and 2006.

Of the 19 states not party that voted in support of Resolution 66/29 on 2 December 2011, nine have voted in favor of every Mine Ban Treaty resolution since 1997 (Armenia, Bahrain, Finland, Georgia, Oman, Poland, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates); 10
that consistently abstained or were absent previously now vote in favor (Azerbaijan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lao PDR, Marshall Islands, Micronesia FS, Mongolia, Morocco, and Tonga). Somalia, now a State Party, was absent from the 2011 resolution, but has voted in favor in previous years.

The number of states abstaining from supporting the resolution has ranged from a high of 23 in 2002 and 2003 to a low of 17 in 2010, 2005 and 2006. The group of states that could be described as most concerned about the security implications of the Mine Ban Treaty are the 15 states not party that have voted against consecutive resolutions since 1997: Cuba, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Libya (since 1998), Myanmar, North Korea (since 2007), Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, Syria, Uzbekistan (since 1999), the United States, and Vietnam (since 1998).

== Key figures in the making of the treaty ==
=== Letter-writers and non-governmental organizations ===
The Ottawa Anti-Personnel Mines Treaty would not likely have been possible without the sustained effort of thousands of global citizens writing their elected officials in the lead up to the treaty&#x27;s creation and signing in 1997. A small number of core groups mobilized on the landmines problem worked closely with a wider variety of NGOs, including churches, prominent children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rights groups, disarmament and development groups, in order to produce concerted political pressure, as well as with the media to keep the issue in the forefront. Because of this unparalleled involvement of the global public, and their success in lobbying for this initiative, university political science and law departments frequently study the socio-historical initiatives that led to the Ottawa process, arguing it is a leading modern example of the power of peaceful democratic expression and a method for mobilization on disarmament issues or more broadly.

===Jody Williams and The International Campaign to Ban Landmines===
The organization the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its founding coordinator, Jody Williams, were instrumental in the passage of the Ottawa Treaty, and for these efforts they jointly received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. However, since efforts to secure the treaty started over a decade before Williams involvement and the fact that the treaty was a joint effort of so many people from all over the world, including hundreds of influential political and private leaders, some felt that Williams should decline to personally benefit from the award of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. Williams herself has said she feels the organization deserved the award while she did not, and emphasized the collective nature of the movement; as the chair of a group of female Peace Prize recipients, she has used her status as a Peace Prize recipient to bring concerns of woman-led grassroots organizations to the attention of governments.

===Werner Ehrlich===
Available sources such as the study on the Ottawa Treaty made by Stuart Maslen and an article published by Werner Ehrlich in 1996 indicate that the key figure in the making of the Ottawa Treaty was the Austrian diplomat Werner Ehrlich, head of the Disarmament Unit at the Austrian Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1995/96:

He initiated the process by making the first draft of the future Treaty in April 1996 and succeeded to get this project and the proposed unorthodox procedure – to negotiate this Convention outside the Conference on Disarmament (CD) – adopted by the Ottawa Conference in October 1996 – in spite of nearly universal opposition.
It was an uphill struggle. This proposal was understandably rejected by countries which see anti-personnel mines as essential for national defense. Consequently, they tried repeatedly to block the project or to steer it to a dead end in the CD.

The proposal was however also opposed by Countries and NGO&#x27;s supporting a total ban, because of their conviction that practical measures would be more conducive to a total ban than a Convention, A view which was reflected in the &quot;purpose&quot; of the 1996 Ottawa Conference: &quot;to catalyze practical efforts to move toward a ban and to create partnerships essential to building the necessary political will to achieve a global ban on AP mines.&quot;
But this meant in fact, that a total ban was postponed to a remote future: until practical efforts may have convinced one day Countries depending on APMs for their defense, that APMs are useless or counterproductive.

The approach of Werner Ehrlich was different:

It was essential to delegitimize as soon as possible any use of APMs by the adoption of an instrument of international law on a total ban of APMs, because it would not only bind the Parties to the convention but would also have at least a moral effect on Countries not Parties by clearly contradicting the idea that the use of APMs is legal.

It was also essential to elaborate this Treaty in a free standing negotiating process outside the Conference on Disarmament (CD), as there mine-affected Countries not Members of the CD would be excluded and opponents of a total ban could block the project immediately, e. g. simply by denying consensus to put it on the agenda.

At the Ottawa Conference in October 1996 Ehrlich defended the project of a Total Ban Convention, against opponents of a total ban as well as even against leading humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which at the beginning saw the project as premature, as detraction or even as a waste of time. He succeeded finally against all odds – due in particular to the inspired and timely support of the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lloyd Axworthy – to get his project indorsed by the Conference: Austria was tasked to draft the text for the negotiations which were to be held – as proposed – in a free standing negotiating process, a procedure later called the &quot;Ottawa Process&quot;.

His third and final draft before leaving disarmament at the end of 1996 to become Austria&#x27;s Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran was known as the &quot;First Austrian Draft&quot; and served as the basis for the following negotiations leading to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in December 1997

=== Canada&#x27;s Mine Action ===
Mines Action Canada grew out of the efforts of Canadian non-governmental agencies concerned about the rapidly spreading impact of landmines and cluster munitions. The group was successful in garnering positive Canadian government attention to the call for a ban by mobilizing Canadians to demand action. By 1996, sustained and growing citizen action led Minister Axworthy of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to collaborate with Mines Action Canada and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. This in turn led to the Government of Canada challenging other countries to negotiate and sign a treaty banning ban landmines within one year. This call to action led directly to the signing of the &quot;Convention on the Prohibition on the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction&quot; commonly known as the &#x27;mine ban treaty&#x27; one year later in December 1997. Mines Action Canada was hosted by Physicians for Global Survival, chaired by Valerie Warmington and coordinated by Celina Tuttle from the coalition&#x27;s inception until after the treaty was signed.

=== Diana, Princess of Wales ===
Once in the final stages leading into the treaty, the Ottawa Treaty was ardently championed by Diana, Princess of Wales. In January 1997, she visited Angola and walked near a minefield to dramatize its dangers. In January 1997, Angola&#x27;s population was approximately 10 million and had about 10–20 million land mines in place from its civil war. In August 1997, she visited Bosnia with the Landmine Survivors Network. Her work with landmines focused on the injuries and deaths inflicted on children. Her tragic death just a couple weeks later, propelled the cause dear to her forward on the world stage and, as reported by TIME Magazine in their September 1997 edition, &quot;After her death, the treaty... took on the luster of a humanitarian memorial to Diana and her cause.&quot; When the Second Reading of the Landmines Bill took place in 1998 in the British House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook praised Diana and paid tribute to her work on landmines.

=== Lloyd Axworthy ===
In his Canadian Foreign Affairs portfolio (1996–2000), Lloyd Axworthy became internationally known (and criticized in some quarters) for his advancement of the concept of human security and including the Ottawa Treaty, and the creation of the International Criminal Court.

===Bobby Muller===
Robert O. (Bobby) Muller (born 1946) is an American peace advocate. He participated in the Vietnam War as a young soldier, and after returning from Vietnam, Muller began to work for veterans&#x27; rights and became a peace activist. Since then, Muller founded Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) in 1978 and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) in 1980. The VVAF co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won a 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.

<text>Samuel Francis Smith (October 21, 1808 – November 16, 1895) was an American Baptist minister, journalist, and author. He is best known for having written the lyrics to &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; (sung to the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot;), which he entitled &quot;America&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 21, 1808.

Smith attended Harvard College from 1825 to 1829, and was a classmate of William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, George T. Davis, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Isaac Edward Morse, Benjamin Peirce, George W. Richardson, and Charles Storer Storrow.

From 1829 to 1834, he attended Andover Theological Seminary.

===&quot;America&quot; (&quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;)===

While a student at Andover Theological Seminary, Smith gave Lowell Mason lyrics he had written and the song was first performed in public on July 4, 1831, at a children&#x27;s Independence Day celebration at Park Street Church in Boston. The song, titled &quot;America&quot;, was first published by Lowell Mason in &quot;The Choir&quot; in 1832.

Smith later wrote an additional stanza for the April 30, 1889 Washington Centennial Celebration. 

==Ministry==
In 1834, Smith worked in Boston editing the &quot;Baptist Missionary Magazine&quot; before going to Maine. His ordination as a Baptist minister was on February 12, 1834, in Waterville, Maine, where in addition to his ministry, he served as Professor of Modern Languages at Waterville College.

On September 16, 1834, Smith married Mary White Smith, whose maiden name was Smith. They had six children. Smith was foster father for four years to teenager Thornton Chase, who, instead of entering college, left to become an officer in the Civil War. In 1894-5 Thornton Chase would become the first western convert to the Baháʼí Faith, and was a leading member in the United States.

In 1842, he left Waterville to go to Newton, Massachusetts. Smith did not stop writing. In addition to &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;, Smith wrote over 150 other hymns. In 1843, he teamed with Baron Stow to compile a Baptist hymnal, &quot;The Psalmist&quot;.

In Newton, Smith became editor of the &quot;Christian Review&quot; and other publications of the Baptist Missionary Union. He continued his ministry as well, becoming pastor of the First Baptist Church in Newton in the village of Newton Centre. In Newton, Smith bought a house at 1181 Centre Street.

After twelve years as pastor of the Newton Centre church, he became editorial secretary of the BMU and served there for fifteen years.

From 1875 to 1880, he made many trips to Europe, Turkey, India, Ceylon and Burma to visit missionary outposts.

He wrote a history of his adoptive home, entitled &quot;History of Newton, Massachusetts&quot;, which was published in 1880.

Professor and author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. recommended Smith as a potential candidate for an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Harvard University in 1893. Harvard president Charles William Eliot declined, noting that &quot;My Country &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; was better known for its tune, which Smith did not write, rather than its lyrics. Holmes disagreed, noting that &quot;his song will be sung centuries from now, when most of us and our pipings are forgotten.&quot;

==Death and burial==

Samuel Francis Smith died suddenly on November 16, 1895, while on his way by train to preach in the Boston neighborhood of Readville. He was buried in Newton Cemetery. &quot;America&quot; was among the pieces sung at his funeral. He was survived by his wife and five children. His son D. A. W. Smith was president of the Karen Baptist Theological Seminary in Burma; his granddaughter Emma Waldo Smith Marshall taught at the seminary.

==Legacy==
Smith was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

The home Smith lived in Andover is now a Phillips Academy dormitory named America House.

The home in which Smith and his family lived in Newton is no longer standing. In 1958, a society was formed to buy and preserve it, but the home was damaged by fire in 1968 and again in 1969, leading to its destruction. A small monument and growing garden honors his legacy.

<text>Aberaeron (), previously anglicised as Aberayron, is a town, community and electoral ward in Ceredigion, Wales. Located on the coast between Aberystwyth and Cardigan, its resident population was 1,274 in the 2021 census.

The name of the town is Welsh for &quot;mouth of the Aeron&quot;. It is derived from the Middle Welsh &quot;&quot; (slaughter), which gave its name to Aeron, believed by some to have been a Welsh god of war.

One of the main Ceredigion County Council office sites is located in Aberaeron.

==History and design==

In 1800, there was no significant coastal settlement here. The present town was planned and developed from 1805 by the Rev. Alban Thomas Jones Gwynne. He built a harbour which operated as a port and supported a shipbuilding industry in the 19th century. A group of workmen&#x27;s houses and a school were built on the harbour&#x27;s north side, but these were reclaimed by the sea. Steam ships continued to visit the harbour until the 1920s but, in later years, it evolved into a small half-tide harbour for recreational craft. The estuary is also crossed by a wooden pedestrian bridge.

Crafts were an important part of village life in the 19th century. Information recorded in trade directories shows that in 1830, although it was not yet fully developed as a port, in Aberaeron there were one woollen manufacturer, one bootmaker, one baker, one corn miller, one blacksmith, one blacksmith and shovel maker, two shipwrights, one carpenter and one hatmaker.

In the late 1890s, a hand-powered cable car, the Aeron Express, was built to ferry workers across the harbour when the bridge was demolished by floods. The structure was recreated in 1988 as a tourist attraction that ran until the end of summer 1994, when it was closed under health and safety regulations.

The architecture of Aberaeron is unusual for this part of rural Wales, being constructed around a principal square, Alban Square, of Regency style buildings grouped around the harbour. This was the work of Edward Haycock Sr., an architect from Shrewsbury. His designs also included the former Aberaeron Town Hall, which was completed in 1846 and became County Hall, Aberaeron in 1910. Some of the architecture was of sufficient interest to feature on British postage stamps.

Aberaeron Golf Club was founded in 1923. It continued until the Second World War, when the course was turned over to agriculture to aid the war effort. Post-war attempts to reinstate the club failed.

==Castell Cadwgan==
Castell Cadwgan, a 12th-century ringwork fortification around a probable wooden structure, was by the shore at Aberaeron, but has long since been claimed by the sea. Traces of the structure remain in mounds of earth and the remains of the enclosure bank.

Henry Gastineau&#x27;s &quot;Wales Illustrated in a Series of Views&quot; (1810) mentions the site: &quot;Near the town are some remains of an ancient fortress called Castell Cadwgan, thought to have been erected by King Cadwgan, about the year 1148.&quot; However, Cadwgan is recorded as having been killed in 1111. &quot;Welsh Minstrelsy: Containing the Land beneath the Sea&quot; (1824) says: &quot;Just where Sarn Ddewi juts out from the shore is an old fort, called Castell Cadwgan.&quot;

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Aberaeron, at community (town) and county level: Aberaeron Town Council and Ceredigion County Council. The town council meets at the Memorial Hall on South Road. The county council also has one of its main offices in the town, at Neuadd Cyngor Ceredigion (Ceredigion Council Hall) at Penmorfa.
===Administrative history===
When the town was laid out in the 19th century, Aberaeron straddled the parishes of Henfynyw and Llanddewi Aberarth. Efforts to secure local government functions for the town were hesitant. The town was declared a local government district in 1892, but no-one stood for election to the local board that was supposed to administer the district. The local board remained dormant until local government districts across the country were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Aberayron Urban District Council held its first meeting on 31 December 1894.

The official spelling of the urban district&#x27;s name was &#x27;Aberayron&#x27; until 1966, when the council changed it to &#x27;Aberaeron&#x27; to better respect modern Welsh orthography.

Aberaeron Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Aberaeron was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district. District-level functions passed to Ceredigion District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Ceredigion County Council.

The first representative for Aberayron on Cardiganshire County Council was John Morgan Howell, who became a prominent figure in the political life of the county. Following his election in January 1889, bonfires were lit to celebrate his victory.

Since 1995, the town has been part of the Aberaeron and Aberarth ward, electing one councillor to Ceredigion County Council. Since 2008, the ward has been represented by Elizabeth Evans for the Welsh Liberal Democrats.

==Education==
The town and surrounding areas are served by Ysgol Gyfun Aberaeron, a bilingual secondary comprehensive school. Although there is no provision for higher education in the town, three university towns are within easy travelling range: Aberystwyth ( away) and the Lampeter (), and Carmarthen () sites of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

==Location and features==
Aberaeron is located between Cardigan and Aberystwyth on the A487, at a junction with the A482 leading south-east to the university town of Lampeter. It lies on the Ceredigion Coast Path, part of the Wales Coast Path.

The shoreline consists of generally steep storm beaches of pebbles, although fine sand is visible at low tide levels. Aberaeron South Beach was awarded the Blue Flag rural beach award in 2005. The Harbourmaster Hotel is nearby.

The climate is mild and temperate, largely conditioned by the proximity of the relatively shallow sea. However, Aberaeron experiences occasional winter frosts when cold air descends the Aeron valley from the upland parts of Ceredigion.

Dylan Thomas&#x27;s links with Aberaeron, New Quay and Talsarn have been documented. The Dylan Thomas Trail runs through Ceredigion, passing through Aberaeron and ending in New Quay.

There are 248 listed buildings in the Aberaeron community, most in the town itself.

An annual festival of Welsh ponies and cobs is held on Alban Square Field every August. A life-sized statue of a Welsh cob stallion, sculpted by David Mayer, was donated to the town in 2005 by the festival. An annual carnival takes place on the Monday bank holiday in August, with a procession of floats and a carnival queen moving from the quay to Alban Square.

==Transport==

In 1866, transport in Lampeter was greatly improved with the opening of the railway linking Carmarthen and Aberystwyth. In 1911, a branch line, the Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway, opened to Aberaeron. Following the nationalisation of the railways, the passenger service to Aberaeron ceased in 1951; the last freight train left the town on 2 April 1965.

A regular bus service links the town with Aberystwyth, Lampeter and Carmarthen, with several daily through services to Swansea, Bridgend and Cardiff. Another service connects with New Quay, Aberporth and Cardigan from Monday to Saturday.

<text>Rkatsiteli (; ; literally &quot;red stem&quot; or &quot;red horned&quot;) is a kind of grape used to produce white wine.

==History==
This ancient vinifera originates in Georgia and is supposed to be one of the oldest grape varieties. 

Rkatsiteli was the most widely planted grape variety in the Soviet Union and, by 1978, was responsible for 18% of all Soviet wine production. There it was used to make everything from table wine to liqueurs to Sherry-like fortified wine. Before President Gorbachev&#x27;s vine pull scheme, it was possibly the world&#x27;s most widely planted white wine grape.

In Kakheti it was particularly known for its sweet dessert wines fashioned in the same manner as port wine. There were many attempts to create a sparkling wine from the grape, but its naturally high alcohol levels prevented it from being much of a success.

==Wine regions==
The grape is mostly planted in its ancestral home of Georgia, though there are still sizable plantings in other Eastern European countries like Russia, Armenia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, and North Macedonia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

===Other regions===
It is also planted, in small amounts, in Australia and the eastern United States, mainly in the Finger Lakes region of New York state, Massachusetts, New Jersey and in Virginia and North Carolina. There have also been some experimental plantings in California, the Grand Valley AVA and West Elks AVA of Colorado and China (where the grape is known as &quot;Baiyu&quot;).

==Viticulture==
The high acidity of the grape is prone to make the wines excessively tart, so winemakers try to pick the grapes as late as possible to maximize the sugar balance to offset the acidity. In most regions of Eastern Europe harvest is typically in mid-October.

==Wine style==
Rkatsiteli makes a noticeably acidic, balanced white wine with spicy and floral notes in the aroma.

<text>Apra Harbor, also called Port Apra, is a deep-water port on the western side of the United States territory of Guam. It is considered one of the best natural ports in the Pacific Ocean. The harbor is bounded by Cabras Island and the Glass Breakwater to the north and the Orote Peninsula in the south. Naval Base Guam and the Port of Guam are the two major users of the harbor. It is also a popular recreation area for boaters, surfers, scuba divers, and other recreationalists.

== Geography ==

The geography of Apra Harbor has been extensively modified from its pre-historical state by humans. The entrance to the harbor is flanked by Point Udall, formerly Orote Point, to the south and Spanish Rocks at the tip of the Glass Breakwater. The Glass Breakwater, built on top of Calalan Bank and the fringing Luminao Reef, connects to Cabras Island, the location of the Port of Guam, which handles more than 90% of civilian cargo imported to Guam. Inland areas in the villages of Piti and Santa Rita form the eastern boundary of the harbor. There are two small artificial peninsulas jutting into the eastern end of the harbor. The northernmost is named Drydock Island, the tip of which is a military reservation with wharves for fueling ships. South of Drydock Island is Sasa Bay, one of five marine preserves created by the Government of Guam. The southern boundary of Sasa Bay is formed by Polaris Point, a geographically separate part of Naval Base Guam that is the homeport of Submarine Squadron 15. Polaris Point and the Orote Peninsula form the entrance to Inner Apra Harbor, a military restricted area. The Orote Peninsula holds the main part of Naval Base Guam and is approximately four miles to its tip at Point Udall. There are two named large coral formations roughly west of Sasa Bay in Outer Apra Harbor: Western Shoals and Jade Shoals.

Ten rivers flow into Apra Harbor: Atantano River, Sasa River, Aguada River, Big Guatali River, Aplacho River, Maggo River, Guatali River, Laghas River, Tenjo River and Paulana River.

=== Census designated place ===
&quot;Apra Harbor&quot; is also a census-designated place (CDP) in Guam that comprises Naval Base Guam and housing extending into the hills of Santa Rita village. In 2010, the population of the Apra Harbor CDP was 2,471.

== History ==
Apra comes from the Chamorro word &quot;apapa&quot;, meaning &quot;low.&quot; Apapa is the original name of Cabras Island. The harbor offered rich fishing grounds and was home to many Chamorro villages.

During Spanish rule, the name of Saint Louis IX was added and the harbor was referred to as the port of San Luis de Apra. However, it was not a favored anchorage during the Spanish–Chamorro Wars of the late seventeenth century and resulting the early Spanish period, mainly because of the many reefs and coral heads. The Spanish preferred ports were Umatac and Hagåtña, resulting in Apra Harbor being used by foreigners seeking to avoid Spanish authority. The English pirate John Eaton is reported to have anchored at Apra Harbor in 1685 to trade provisions with Chamorros.

In the early 18th century, Spain&#x27;s Council of the Indies grew increasingly concerned about competing navies threatening the Manila galleon trade and Spain&#x27;s possessions in the Pacific. This was aggravated by an attack in 1721 by the English privateer John Clipperton upon a supply ship from Cavite anchored at Merizo. In 1734, Governor Francisco de Cárdenas Pacheco opened up new anchorages in Apra Harbor, and built three cannon batteries or forts to protect them. Fort San Luis was built in 1737 near Gab Gab and Fort Santiago was built at Orote Point to guard the entrance to the harbor. The third fort, Fort Santa Cruz, was built around 1800 atop a reef near the entrance to the harbor.

William Haswell, an officer on the first documented American visit to Guam in January 1802, wrote a description of Apra Harbor:
Apra Harbor was thus used more frequently in the nineteenth century. Piti became the primary port, used to connect to the capital in Hagåtña. Meanwhile, Sumay became a popular port of whalers, in particular during the height of Pacific whaling in the early 1800s. In the 1840s, up to 60 whaling ships stopped in Apra Harbor every year, turning Sumay into the commercial and financial center of the island. The decline of whaling by the end of the nineteenth century also resulted in the economic decline of the port, and lack of maintenance to the harbor defenses. Even in 1817, Otto von Kotzebue reported that Fort San Luis was no longer in use. The three cannon at Fort Santiago were reported unusable in 1853 and, in 1884, Governor Francisco Olive y Garcia declared that Fort Santiago was useful only as an observation post. By the time of the 1898 Spanish–American War none of the three fortifications was in operation.

=== American capture ===

American captain Henry Glass had received intelligence that Spanish men-of-war were anchored at Guam and that the harbor itself had formidable defenses. However, when Glass arrived in Apra Harbor on June 20, 1898 to claim the island on behalf of the United States, he encountered no resistance. A Marine Barracks Guam was established on Sumay in 1901, and a small navy yard at Piti. Apra Harbor was used as a coaling station, refueling ships transiting across the Pacific. The new American Naval government also began to develop the harbor, though launch boats were still required to navigate the coral reefs to land at Piti and Sumay. In 1903, the Commercial Pacific Cable Company laid submarine communications cable for telegraph through a station at Sumay, linking the United States to Asia, and each to Guam, for the first time.

On April 7, 1917, the scuttling by her crew of SMS &quot;Cormoran&quot;, a German merchant raider that had been held in Apra Harbor for two years, was the first violent action of the United States in World War I, first shots fired by the U.S. against Germany in WWI, the first German prisoners of war captured by the U.S., and the first Germans killed in action by the U.S. in WWI

In 1922, dredged materials from the harbor were used to fill the coastline at Sumay and a seawall was constructed, among the first large scale man-made changes to the shoreline. On March 17, 1921, U.S. suspicions of Japanese intentions for its South Seas Mandate led it to create a U.S. Marine Squadron floatplane base at Sumay. Guam&#x27;s first golf course, Sumay Golf Links, was established in the village in 1923. The U.S. eventually decided to close the seaplane base at Sumay on February 23, 1931. In 1935, Pan American Airways established rights to use the former Marine Aviation facility and made Sumay a base for its &quot;China Clipper&quot;. the first trans-Pacific air cargo service, flying from San Francisco to Manila, arrived at Sumay on November 27, 1935 and the first passenger service flight on October 21, 1936.
In the 1930s, the Empire of Japan traded with Guam specifically with the view to increasing its knowledge of the island. With tensions rising after the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria starting the Second Sino-Japanese War, Rear Admiral Arthur Japy Hepburn was appointed on June 7, 1938 to chair a board to provide recommendations on the American response. The resulting Hepburn Board Report recommended a massive buildup of U.S. Navy facilities. The Report recommended fortifying Guam as an air and submarine base, with many improvements to Apra Harbor, but the Navy balked at the estimated cost, eventually designated $5 million for Apra Harbor improvements. A strong typhoon struck Guam on November 3, 1940, causing widespread damage. In Apra Harbor, the storm damaged the Navy Yard at Piti and the Marine barracks and Pan American Airways facilities at Sumay. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s YM-13, which had been dredging a channel near Sumay, was blown ashore and a yard patrol boat sunk.

Among the Hepburn Board Report improvements that was funded was the construction of a breakwater upon Luminao Reef, which began in August 1941. Limestone blocks quarried at Cabras Island were skidded along the reef to an improvised derrick. By the time of the Japanese invasion, one mile of breakwater, 36 feet wide five-feet above sea level had been constructed. A 1946 Navy report notes, &quot;practically all the [Hepburn] board&#x27;s recommendations, except those relating to Guam, were carried out and contributed materially to our position when war actually developed.&quot; During the 1941 Japanese invasion, Guam was practically defenseless.

=== World War II ===

During the Japanese occupation of Guam, the residents of Sumay were evicted and the town converted into a Japanese garrison. The harbor itself was extensively used by Japanese vessels, including for repair and refueling of their submarines and warships. Orote Peninsula was the center of Japanese resistance during the U.S. liberation of Guam in 1944 and the area around the harbor saw intense fighting. Both Piti and Sumay were leveled by the pre-invasion bombardment and very few harbor improvements survived.

Clearance, salvage and harbor construction began before the island was fully secure by advance elements of the 301st Naval Construction Battalion (&quot;Seabees&quot;) (NCB 301), tasked with salvage, clearing and developing ports even as fighting continued ashore, arriving in in the first days of August. Full scale development began with arrival of the NCB 301 headquarters and barracks ship on 11 August 1944.

Constructing harbor facilities was the highest priority and the Seabees began installing pontoon piers. Construction at the first pier, at an old Navy fueling site on Cabras Island, required blasting to get to a depth. This first pier was constructed between August 5 and 22, 1944. By October 1, six piers were operational and a seventh was being built, when a typhoon destroyed or severely damaged all the pontoon piers. At the same time as piers were being constructed, two other massive projects were occurring. The Glass Breakwater, named after the captain who captured Guam in 1898, was extended on Calalan Bank to a width of . The northern arm of Apra Harbor, from the main island through Cabras to the tip of the breakwater at Spanish Rocks measured .

Construction of Inner Apra Harbor required of dredging and of quay wall. A small boat pool and a submarine base with a finger pier was established in the Inner harbor. Small boat repair facilities at Piti were repaired and improved. &quot;Navy News&quot; noted that over 7,000 tons of explosives had been used in 1944 to clear ship passages in Guam. of these explosives is enough to destroy a volume of coral deep. By July 1945, two months before the end of the Pacific War, there were 14 quay-wall berths, nine pontoon piers, two wooden fueling piers, ten Landing Ship, Tank (LST) berths, and one submarine pier.
The residents of Sumay were not allowed to return and rebuild their homes, and the U.S. military relocated them to a refugee camp in the nearby inland hills in 1946. Unbeknownst to them, Admiral Chester Nimitz had requested 55% of Guam be set aside for military use, including all of Sumay. In 1946, the U.S. Congress passed Public Law 594, &quot;The Guam Acquisition of Lands Act&quot;, allowing the U.S. Navy to acquire any and all lands it deemed necessary on the island. In 1948, the military filed Civil Case No. 5-49 in the Superior Court of Guam, declaring a taking of Sumay, as well as parts of Piti and Agat, totaling 2,471 acres, with little or no compensation. The refugees from Sumay created the village of Santa Rita, the municipality in which the Orote Peninsula is now located. The population center of Piti was relocated away from its old shoreline along Apra Harbor.

The territorial Naval Administration ran the commercial port until 1951, when the 24 acres of commercial port in Piti was transferred to the United States Department of Commerce. In 1962, the Interior Department transferred the commercial port to the Government of Guam. Over 1,000 acres was eventually transferred from the federal government to the Government of Guam for port use. The port built the ability to handle containerized cargo in 1969. In 1969, a yacht club was founded and began using the harbor for recreational small boating. During the 1960s and 1970s, the port&#x27;s strategic importance was highlighted by its utility during the Vietnam War.
On August 12, 1974, the tug towing RMS Caribia, a decommissioned passenger ship, to Taiwan sailed into the tropical storm that later became Typhoon Mary and attempted to reach safety at Apra Harbor. In danger of being pulled onto the reef, the tug captain cut the tow line just from Spanish Rocks. Adrift, &quot;Caribia&quot; crashed against the tip of Glass Breakwater with her stern blocking a third of the harbor entrance. She broke into three pieces and rough weather prevented the Navy and Coast Guard from determining if her stern section piece still blocked the entrance, closing the port. Side-scan sonar was eventually used to determine that the harbor entrance could be used. The Army Corps of Engineers conducted its largest ever ship salvage, which was complicated by the discovery of a Korean War-era LCU wreck next to &quot;Caribia&quot; with 50 tons of unexploded ordnance, prompting the biggest project ever conducted by the Explosive Ordnance Division on Guam.

In 1997, Guam designated Sasa Bay, which is located in the east of the Harbor as a marine preserve in order to protect declining fish populations.

=== Military realignment ===
In 2006 the U.S. Japan &quot;Roadmap for Realignment Implementation Agreement&quot; agreed that over 8,600 U.S. Marines currently based in Okinawa, Japan would relocate to the U.S. territory of Guam and the Marianas Islands. This reorientation could be one of the largest peacetime military relocations in U.S. history. The details of the military move are evolving, and much is on hold due to budget sequestration. The U.S. Navy has suggested the need for expansion of Apra Harbor, which is the largest deep water port in the Western Pacific and the busiest in Micronesia to allow the basing of additional ships in Guam as part of the Navy&#x27;s shift to the Pacific.

== Activities ==

Apra Harbor currently has many users, the two major ones being Naval Base Guam and the Port of Guam. Since 2009, facilities on Naval Base Guam are supported by Joint Region Marianas. The largest tenant unit at Naval Base Guam is Submarine Squadron 15, which is supported by ship tender . Coast Guard Station Apra Harbor is also located on Naval Base Guam property and has an area of responsibility including the Mariana Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia; it has three Sentinel-class cutters: , , and ; and the Seagoing Buoy Tender USCGC &quot;Sequoia&quot;. Kilo Wharf, located on the Orote Peninsula near the mouth of the harbor, is the only U.S. deep water ammunition port in the Western Pacific and also allows emergency berthing by visiting aircraft carriers, such as during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak aboard .

The Port of Guam handles over ninety percent of total imports to Guam. In FY2008, more than 2 million cargo revenue tons in 99,908 containers were handled, including for transshipment to nearby Western Pacific islands. Five cruise ships visit Guam annually, requiring a reconfiguring of port operations.

Marinas are located in the area known as Inner Cabras in Piti between Cabras and Drydock Island, just south of the Guam Power Authority plants. Aquaworld Marina and Harbor of Refuge are owned and operated by the Port, with slips leased to tenants. The area, collectively known as Cabras Marina, berths personal small watercraft, diving boats, tourist sightseeing boats, and an Atlantis Submarine, which visits a coral reef off Gab Gab on the Orote Peninsula. The Marianas Yacht Club, located on the south shore of Drydock Island on Sasa Bay, provides mooring buoys for transPacific cruising yachts

In addition to shore berths, a total of 21 mooring buoys are located in the harbor. However, none is suitable for large vessel mooring during a typhoon, requiring craft to put out to sea for safety in extreme weather. One buoy is reserved for a Military Sealift Command strategic sealift ship.

=== Recreation ===

Harbor beaches on Naval property include Gab Gab Beach and San Luis Beach on the Orote Peninsula, and Fantasy Island on Polaris Point. Beaches on Cabras include Family Beach and Outhouse Beach. Port Authority Beach is located on the north shore of Drydock Island.

Apra Harbor hosts a robust coral reef community and many shipwrecks. There are many named scuba diving sites either within or immediately outside the harbor, including: Harley Reef; and &quot;Tokai Maru&quot;, allowing divers to touch wrecks from the two World Wars at the same time; Jade Shoals; Big Blue Reef; Middle Shoals; Western Shoals; Gab Gab; Finger Reef; American Tanker; Blue and White; Luminau; Blue Hole; Kizugawa Maru; and many others.

The outer shore of the Glass Breakwater is one of the most popular surfing spots on Guam, along with Talofofo Bay and Inarajan Bay.

=== Sasa Bay Marine Preserve ===

The Sasa Bay Marine Preserve, comprising waters and lands between Drydock Island and Polaris Point, is a recreational and ecological protected area with regulated fishing. Measuring , it is one of five Marine Preserves created by the Government of Guam in 1997. The Preserve contains a mangrove swamp, is a foraging area for Hawksbill sea turtle and is habitat for several oyster and clam species. It also includes four or five patch reefs in its deeper waters.

== Management and ownership ==
Operations in Outer Apra Harbor are under the jurisdiction of The Port Authority of Guam and the United States Coast Guard. Vessels entering, leaving, or shifting berth in Apra Harbor are required to give 24 hours notice to the Port Authority of Guam Port Control Harbor Master and the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port. Inner Apra Harbor is a restricted area that is marked by two uncharted buoys. Operations in Inner Apra Harbor are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy Port Control Harbormaster.

<text>Cajamarca (), also known by the Quechua name, Kashamarka, is the capital and largest city of the Cajamarca Region as well as an important cultural and commercial center in the northern Andes. It is located in the northern highlands of Peru at approximately 2,750 m (8,900 ft) above sea level in the valley of the Mashcon river. Cajamarca had an estimated population of about 226,031 inhabitants in 2015, making it the 13th largest city in Peru.

Cajamarca has a mild highland climate, and the area has very fertile soil. The city is well known for its dairy products and mining activity in the surroundings.

Among its tourist attractions, Cajamarca has numerous examples of Spanish colonial religious architecture, beautiful landscapes, pre-Hispanic archeological sites and hot springs at the nearby town of Baños del Inca (Baths of the Inca). The history of the city is highlighted by the Battle of Cajamarca, which marked the defeat of the Inca Empire by Spanish invaders as the Incan emperor Atahualpa was captured and executed here.

== Etymology ==
The Quechua etymology of the place name is pretty straightforward and transparent. Colonial spellings &quot;Caxamalca ~ Caxamarca&quot; match contemporary Quechua pronunciation &quot;Kashamarka&quot; (written here in contemporary Quechua orthography), where &quot;marka&quot; is a Quechua-Aymara word for &#x27;town&#x27; or &#x27;region&#x27;, and &quot;kasha&quot; is a Central and Northern Quechua word for &#x27;thorn&#x27; or &#x27;thorny plant&#x27;. So the compound name meant originally &#x27;town/ province of thorny plants&#x27;. Afterwards, a Spanish general sound change took place that transformed its voiceless postalveolar fricative into a velar one ʃ &gt; x, thus generating contemporary Spanish pronunciation of the place name. Confusion about the etymology has mainly originated from a false etymology offered by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who was not familiar with Quechua dialects outside Cuzco. Trying to find an etymon for &quot;caxa&quot;, Garcilaso offered &quot;qasa&quot; (&#x27;frost&#x27;, written here in contemporary Quechua orthography). Still nowadays, Cuzco-based Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua&#x27;s dictionary writes the name as &quot;Qasamarka&quot; according to the Garcilaso etymology.

==History==

The city and its surroundings have been occupied by several cultures for more than 2000 years. Traces of pre-Chavín cultures can be seen in nearby archaeological sites, such as Cumbe Mayo and Kuntur Wasi.

Huacaloma is an archaeological site located 3.5 km southeast of the historic center of the city of Cajamarca (currently in the middle of the Metropolitan Area of Cajamarca). Its antiquity is calculated between 1500 and 1000 BC, that is to say, it belongs to the Andean Formative Period. It presents enclosures with bonfires, similar to those of La Galgada and Kotosh, but with simpler design. It was a ceremonial center where fire rituals were performed.

In 1986 the Organization of American States designated Cajamarca as a site of Historical and Cultural Heritage of the Americas.

===Pre-Columbian Cajamarca===
The Cajamarca culture began flourishing as a culture during the first millennium AD.

The unbroken stylistic continuity (i.e., autonomy) of Cajamarca art from its inception around 200-100 BC up to the Spanish conquest is remarkable, given the presence of powerful neighbors and the series of imperial expansions that reached this area. It is known essentially only from its fine ceramics made with locally abundant white kaolin paste fired at high temperatures (over 1,000 °C).

Cajamarca culture pottery has long been recognized as a prestige ware, given its distinctiveness and wide, if sporadic, distribution. &quot;Initial Cajamarca&quot; ceramics (200 BC to AD 200) are largely confined to the Cajamarca Basin. &quot;Early Cajamarca&quot; ceramics (AD 200–450) have more complex and diverse decorations and extensive distribution. They are found in much of the North Highlands as well as in yunka zones on both the Amazonian and Pacific sides of the Andes. In fact, at least one Early Cajamarca high-prestige burial has been documented at the Moche site of San Jose de Moro (lower Jequetepeque), and a set of imported kaolin spoons has been found at the site of Moche, the city capital of the Southern Moche polity.

Cajamarca ceramics achieved their greatest prestige and widest distribution during &quot;Middle Cajamarca&quot; subphase B (700-900), coinciding with Moche demise and dominance of the Wari empire in Peru. &quot;Middle Cajamarca&quot; prestige ceramics have been found at a great deal of Wari sites, as far as southern-frontier Wari sites such as the city of Pikillacta located in Cusco region. Moreover, the construction of the north coastal settlement of Cerro Chepen, a massive terraced mountain city-fortress in Moche territory is attributed to an apparent joint effort between Wari and Cajamarca polities to ruler over this area of Peru.

In 2004 a large building erected in Cerro Chepen mountain was excavated, said structure follows high-altitude Andean architectural models, which is tentatively interpreted as an elite residential structure. Excavations have shown an unexpected association between Late Moche domestic ceramics and fine ceramics from the Cajamarca mountains inside the patios, galleries and rooms that make up the structure. The evidence recovered in this building suggests the presence of highland officials in the heart of the Cerro Chepen Monumental Sector.

However, the rise of the Middle Sican state on the north coast around 900-1000 saw a notable reduction in the distribution of &quot;Late Cajamarca&quot; ceramics back to the extent seen during Moche Phase IV.

Analysis of settlement patterns in the Cajamarca Valley shows a significant reduction in the number of settlements during the &quot;Late Cajamarca&quot; phase (AD 850–1200). Scholars interpret this reduction in the number of settlements as the result of population reduction and/or dispersion, probably linked to the end of Wari influence in the region and the collapse of the EIP/MH regional polity organized around the center of Coyor in the Cajamarca Valley.

With the collapse of Wari influence in the Cajamarca region the number of settlements first dropped, but then gradually increased by the &quot;Final Cajamarca&quot; phase (1250–1532). Cajamarca maintained its prestige, as shown by the influence its ceramics still had on the coast. During the &quot;Final Cajamarca&quot; phase settlements like Guzmango Viejo or Tantarica in the western slopes of the cordillera to the coast, as well as Santa Delia in the Cajamarca Valley became particularly large (&gt; 20ha). These centers have a larger number of clearly distinguishable elite residential units as well as a greater number of fine ceramics than any earlier sites. It is clear that they are top ranked settlements in the region. At least the centers of the upper sections of the coastal valleys to the west probably benefited from their strategic location in relation first to Sican and later to Chimu. Scholars interpret the changes of the &quot;Final Cajamarca&quot; phase as evidence of a renewed prosperity and integration of the region.

===15th century - Inca Empire and Cuismancu Kingdom===

During the period between 1463 and 1471, Ccapac Yupanqui and his nephew Tupac Inca Yupanqui, both Apuskispay-kuna or Inca generals, conquered the city of Cajamarca and brought it into the &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot; or Inca Empire, at the time it was ruled by Tupac Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s father, Pachacutiq. Nevertheless, the city of &quot;Kasha Marka&quot; had already been founded by other ethnic groups almost a century before its incorporation into the Inca empire, approximately in the year 1320.

Although Ccapac Yupanqui conquered the city of Cajamarca, the supply line was poorly made and controlled, as he traveled hastily to Cajamarca without building or conquering on much of the journey from central Peru, Ccapac Yupanqui believed Inca army&#x27;s supply line of troops and supplies wasn&#x27;t optimal and thus put at risk the Inca control over the newly acquired city of Cajamarca. Ccapac Yupanqui left part of his troops garrisoned at Cajamarca, and then he returned to Tawantinsuyu in order to ask for reinforcements and conducted a more extensive campaign in the territories of central Peru, building a great quantity of infrastructure (such as tambos, colcas, pukaras, etc.) along the Inca road. Incas remodeled Cajamarca following Inca canons of architecture, however, not much of it has survived since the Spanish did the same after conquering Cajamarca.

Colonial accounts tell of Cuismancu Kingdom, the historical counterpart of the &quot;Final Cajamarca&quot; archaeological culture. According to the chroniclers, Cuismanco, Guzmango or Kuismanku (modern Quechua spelling) was the political entity that ruled the Cajamarca area before the arrival of the Incas and was incorporated into the Inca dominion.

The kingdom or domain of Cuismanco belongs to the last phase of the Cajamarca Tradition and of all the nations of the northern mountains of Peru it was the one to achieve the highest social, political and cultural development.

Oral tradition records their title, Guzmango Capac – Guzmango being the name of the ethnic group or polity, while Capac signified a divine ruler whose forefathers displayed a special force, energy, and wisdom in ruling. By the time the Spaniards began to ask about their history, the polity&#x27;s residents (called Cajamarquinos today) could remember the names of only two brothers who had served as Guzmango Capac under the Incas.

The first was called Concacax, who was followed by Cosatongo. After Concacax died, his son, Chuptongo, was sent south to serve the emperor, Tupac Inca Yupanqui. There he received an education at court and, as a young adult, became the tutor of one of Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s sons, Guayna Capac. Oral history records that &quot;he gained great fame and reputation in all the kingdom for his quality and admirable customs&quot;. It was also said that Guayna Capac respected Chuptongo as he would a father. Eventually, Tupac Inca Yupanqui named Chuptongo a governor of the empire.

When Guayna Capac succeeded his father as Sapan Inka, Chuptongo accompanied the new sovereign to Quito for the northern campaigns. After years of service, he asked Guayna Capac to allow him to return to his native people. His wish was granted; and, as a sign of his esteem, Guayna Capac made him a gift of one hundred women, one of the highest rewards possible in the Inca empire. In this way, Chuptongo established his house and lineage in the old town of Guzmango, fathered many children, and served as paramount lord until his death.

The struggle for the throne between the two half-brothers Huascar and Atahualpa, sons of Guayna Capac, also divided the sons of Chuptongo. During the civil war that broke out after Guayna Capac&#x27;s death, Caruatongo, the oldest of Chuptongo&#x27;s sons, sided with the northern forces of Atahualpa, while another son, Caruarayco, allied with Huascar, ruler of the south faction.

In 1532 Atahualpa defeated his brother Huáscar in a battle for the Inca throne in Quito (in present-day Ecuador). On his way to Cusco to claim the throne with his army, he stopped at Cajamarca.

===Capture of Atahualpa (1532 A.D.); Colonial period===
On reaching Cajamarca, Francisco Pizarro received news that Atahualpa was resting in Pultumarca, a nearby hot springs complex, Pizarro soon sent some of representatives under command of the young captain Hernando De Soto to invite the Inca to a feast.

After arriving at Atahualpa&#x27;s camp, Hernando de Soto interviewed with Atahualpa. The Inca Emperor was seated on his gold throne or usnu, with two of his concubines on both sides holding a veil that made only his silhouette recognizable. Atahualpa, impressed by the Spanish horses, asked Hernando de Soto to do an equestrian demonstration. In the final act of his demonstration, Hernando De Soto rode on horseback directly up to Atahualpa to intimidate him stopping at the last moment, however Atahualpa did not move or change his expression in the slightest. Nevertheless, some of Atahualpa&#x27;s retainers drew back and for it they were executed that day, after the Spanish committee returned to Cajamarca.

Atahualpa agreed to meet with Pizarro the next day, oblivious to the ploy Pizarro had prepared for him. The following day, Atahualpa arrives in procession with his court and soldiers, although unarmed, Spanish accounts tell of the splendor shown by Atahulpa&#x27;s display, in addition to musicians and dancers, Indians covered the Inca road on which their king would travel with hundreds of colorful flower petals, moreover, Atahualpa&#x27;s retainers marched unison without speaking a word.

Several noble leaders from conquered nations were also present, mostly local kuraka-kuna from the towns nearby, however, there were also notable Tawantinsuyu&#x27;s nobles among them, there were the prominent rulers known as the &quot;Lord of Cajamarca&quot; and the &quot;Lord of Chicha&quot;, both descendants of kings and owners of huge accumulations of wealth and lands in the Inca Empire, each one accompanied with its own sumptuous court, moreover, both were carried on litters in the same manner of Atahualpa. The Lord of Chicha&#x27;s court was so opulent, even more than Atahualpa&#x27;s, that the Spanish, most of them who did not meet Atahualpa until then, at first thought the Lord of Chicha was the Inca Emperor.

Pizarro and his 168 soldiers met Atahualpa in the Cajamarca plaza after weeks of marching from Piura. The Spanish Conquistadors and their Indian allies captured Atahualpa in the Battle of Cajamarca, where they also massacred several thousand unarmed Inca civilians and soldiers in an audacious surprise attack of cannon, cavalry, lances and swords. The rest of the army of 40,000–80,000 (Conquistadors&#x27; estimates) was stationed some kilometers away from Cajamarca in a large military camp, near the Inca resort town of Pultamarca (currently known as &quot;Baños del Inca&quot;), with its thousands of tents as looking from afar &quot;like a very beautiful and well-ordered city, because everyone had his own tent&quot;.

Having taken Atahualpa captive, they held him in Cajamarca&#x27;s main temple. Atahualpa offered his captors a ransom for his freedom: a room filled with gold and silver (possibly the place now known as &quot;El Cuarto del Rescate&quot; or &quot;The Ransom Room&quot;), within two months. Although having complied with the offering, Atahualpa was brought to trial and executed by the Spaniards. the Pizarros, Almagro, Candia, De Soto, Estete, and many others shared in the ransom.

Caruatongo, the &quot;Lord of Cajamarca&quot;, who was privileged enough to have been carried into the plaza of Cajamarca on a litter, a sure sign of the Inca&#x27;s favor, died there on 16 November 1532, when Francisco Pizarro and his followers ambushed and killed many of the emperor&#x27;s retainers and captured the Inca, Atahualpa. Although Caruatongo left an heir (named Alonso Chuplingon, after his Christian baptism), his brother, Caruarayco, succeeded him as headman following local customs. Pizarro himself recognized Caruarayco and confirmed his right to assume the authority of his father. Caruarayco took the name Felipe at his baptism, becoming the first Christian kuraka of Cajamarca. He remained a steadfast ally of the Spaniards during his lifetime, helping to convince the lords of the Chachapoyas people to submit to Spanish rule. Felipe Caruarayco was paramount lord of the people of Guzmango, in the province of Cajamarca, under the authority of the Spaniard, Melchior Verdugo. Pizarro had awarded Verdugo an encomienda in the region in 1 535. Documentation from that year described Felipe as the cacique principal of the province of Cajamarca and lord of Chuquimango, one of seven large lineages or (an administrative unit of one thousand households) that made up the polity. By 1543, however, Felipe was old and sick. His son, don Melchior Caruarayco, whom he favored to succeed him, was still too young to rule, so two relatives were designated as interim governors or regents: don Diego Zublian and don Pedro Angasnapon. Zublian kept this position until death in 1560, and then don Pedro appropriated for himself the title &quot;cacique principal of the seven of Cajamarca&quot;, remaining in office until his death two years later. After his death, the people of Cajamarca asked the corregidor, don Pedro Juares de Illanez, to name don Melchior as their kuraka. After soliciting information from community elders, Illanez named him &quot;natural lord and cacique principal of the seven of Cajamarca&quot;. As the paramount Andean lord of Cajamarca, don Melchior was responsible for the of Guzmango and two more parcialidades (lineages or other groupings of a larger community): Colquemarca (later Espiritu Santo de Chuquimango) and Malcaden (later San Lorenzo de Malcadan. This charge involved approximately five thousand adult males, under various lesser caciques; and, counting their families, the total population that he ruled approached fifty thousand. Most of these mountain people, who lived dispersed in more than five hundred small settlements, subsisted by farming and by herding llamas. Their tribute responsibilities included rotating labor service at the nearby silver mines of Chilete. During one of his many long trips down from the highlands to visit the nearest Spanish city, Trujillo, don Melchior was stricken by a serious illness. He prudently dictated his last will and testament before the local Spanish notary, Juan de Mata, on 20 June 1565. Coming as he did from a relatively remote area where very few Spaniards resided, his will reflects traditional Andean conceptions of society and values before they were fundamentally and forever changed. This is evident in the care he took to list all of his retainers. He claimed ten potters in the place of Cajamarca, a mayordomo or overseer from the parcialidad of Lord Santiago, a retainer from the parcialidad of don Francisco Angasnapon, and a beekeeper who lived near a river. In the town of Chulaquys, his followers included a lesser lord (mandoncillo) with jurisdiction over seven native families. At the mines of Chilete, he listed twenty workers who served him. Don Melchior also claimed 

six servants with no specific residence and at least twenty-four corn farmers and twenty- two pages in the town of Contumasa. Nine different subjects cared for his chili peppers and corn either in Cascas or near the town of Junba (now Santa Ana de Cimba?). He also listed the towns of Gironbi and Guaento, whose inhabitants guarded his coca and chili peppers; Cunchamalca, whose householders took care of his corn; and another town called Churcan de Cayanbi. Finally, he mentioned two towns that he was disputing with a native lord whose Christian name was don Pedro. In total, don Melchior claimed jurisdiction over a minimum of 102 followers and six towns, including the two in dispute. This preoccupation of don Melchior with listing all of his retainers shows how strong Andean traditions remained in the Cajamarca region, even thirty years after the Spanish invasion. Among the indigenous peoples, numbers of followers denoted tangible wealth and power. An Andean chronicler, Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, wrote that lords &quot;will gain rank if the numbers [of their subjects] multiply according to the law of the dominion over Indians. And, if their numbers decline, they too lose [status]&quot;. This concept of status was the same one held in the Inca system. The hatun curaca or huno apo, lord of ten thousand households, ranked higher than a , the lord of one thousand. The latter dominated the lord of one hundred Indians, a pachaca camachicoc, who in turn was superior to the overseers (mandones and mandoncillos) with responsibility for as few as five households. Don Melchior, as a chief of seven , had jurisdiction over other lesser lords, who themselves ruled individual lineages.

==Geography==
Cajamarca is situated at 2750 m (8900 ft) above sea level on an inter-Andean valley irrigated by three main rivers: Mashcon, San Lucas and Chonta; the former two join together in this area to form the Cajamarca river.

===Cityscape===

==== Architecture ====
The style of ecclesiastical architecture in the city differs from other Peruvian cities due to the geographic and climatic conditions. Cajamarca is further north with a milder climate; the colonial builders used available stone rather than the clay often used in the coastal desert cities.

Cajamarca has six Christian churches of Spanish colonial style: San José, La Recoleta, La Inmaculada Concepción, San Antonio, the Cathedral and El Belén. Although all were built in the seventeenth century, the latter three are the most outstanding due to their sculpted facades and ornamentation.

The facades of these three churches were left unfinished, most likely due to lack of funds. The façade of the Cathedral is the most elegantly decorated, to the extent that it was completed. El Belén has a completed façade of the main building, but the tower is half finished. The San Antonio church was left mostly incomplete.

===== Church of Belén =====
This church consists of a single nave with no lateral chapels. Its facade is the most complete of the three, as it was the first to be designed and built.

===== Cathedral of Cajamarca =====
Originally designated to be a parish church, the cathedral took 80 years to construct (1682–1762); the façade remains unfinished. The Cathedral shows how colonial Spanish influence was introduced in the Incan territory.

Side Portals: The side portals are made of pilasters on corbels. It also bears the royal escutcheon of Spain. The portal is considered to have a seventeenth-century character, found in the rectangular emphasis of the design.

Plan: The plan of the cathedral is based on a basilica plan, (with a single apse, barrel vaults in the nave, a transept and sanctuary), but the traditional dome over the crossing has been omitted.

Façade: The façade is noted for the detailing of its sculptures and the artistry in carving. Decorative details include grapevines carved into the spiral columns of the cathedral, with little birds pecking at the grapes. The frieze in the first story is composed of rectangular blocks carved with leaves. The detail of the main portal extends to flower pots and cherubs&#x27; heads next to pomegranates. &quot;The façade of Cajamarca Cathedral is one of the remarkable achievements of Latin American art.&quot;

===== San Antonio =====
Construction began in 1699, with the original plans made by Matías Pérez Palomino. This church is similar in plan to the Cathedral, but the interiors are quite different. San Antonio is a significantly larger structure and has incorporated the large dome over the crossing. Features of the church include large cruciform piers with Doric pilasters, a plain cornice, and stone carved window frames.

Façade: This façade is the most incomplete. While designed in a style similar to that of the cathedral, it is a simplified version.

===Climate===
Cajamarca has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;, in the Köppen climate classification) which is characteristic of high elevations at tropical latitudes. This city presents a semi-dry, temperate, semi-cold climate with presence of rainfall mostly in spring and summer (from October to April) with little or no rainfall the rest of the year.

Daily average temperatures have a great variation, being pleasant during the day but cold during the night and dawn. January is the warmest month, with an average maximum temperature of 72 °F (22 °C) and an average minimum of 45 °F (7 °C). The coldest months are June and July, both with an average maximum of 71 °F (21 °C) but with an average minimum of 38 °F (3 °C). Frosts may occur but are less frequent and less intense than in the southern Peruvian Andes.

== Demographics ==
In recent years, the city has experienced a high rate of migration from other provinces in the region and elsewhere in Peru, mainly due to the mining boom. This phenomenon has caused the city&#x27;s population to increase considerably, from an estimated 80,931 in 1981 to an estimated 283,767 in 2014, an increase of almost three times the population for 33 years. Likewise, the city has recently entered into a conurbation process with the town of Baños del Inca (which by 2014 has more than 20,000 inhabitants in the urban area) and with some populated centers close to these cities. According to INEI, projections exist for the urban conglomerate to reach 500,000 inhabitants by 2030.

==Economy==
Cajamarca is surrounded by a fertile valley, which makes this city an important center of trade of agricultural goods. Its most renowned industry is that of dairy products. Of the 1.2 million tons of milk Peru produces a year, most of it comes from the Cajamarca department. There are 30,000 registered milk producers in Cajamarca and over 503,000 liters of milk are produced each day, which makes Cajamarca the most important dairy and cheese-making region in the country. The principal cheeses produced are:

* &quot;Mantecoso&quot;, made from a fresh curd known as &quot;quesillo&quot; that has been manufactured for decades in rural Cajamarca. &quot;Mantecoso&quot; has become the ‘typical’ cheese and most popular cheese of the area.

* &quot;Queso andino tipo suizo&quot; (Andean Swiss-type cheese), a hard cheese derived from technology imported by a Swiss project supporting rural cheese dairies.

* &quot;Queso fresco&quot;, a generic fresh cheese without a special identity. This is a curd, a little more salted than the &quot;quesillo&quot;, and is sold in mounds of 2 or 3 kg. 

In 1998, cheese makers in Cajamarca joined forces to form a cheese-makers’ association. Thus in September 1999, a group of 39 small and medium-scale enterprises (SME) got together and created the Asociación de Productores de Derivados Lácteos (APDL), Cajamarca’s official cheese-makers’ association focusing on mantecoso cheese. APDL then applied to the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and Protection of Intellectual Property (INDECOPI) for a collective trademark, “Poronguito,” and it was granted in 2000. 
Yanacocha is an active gold mining site 45 km north of Cajamarca, which has boosted the economy of the city since the 1990s.

== Transportation ==
The only airport in Cajamarca is Armando Revoredo Airport located 3.26 km northeast of the main square. Cajamarca is connected to other northern Peruvian cities by bus transport companies.

The construction of a railway has been proposed to connect mining areas in the region to a harbor in the Pacific Ocean.

==Education==

Cajamarca is home of one of the oldest high schools in Peru: San Ramon School, founded in 1831. Some of the largest, most important schools in the city include Marcelino Champagnat School, Cristo Rey School, Santa Teresita School, and Juan XXIII School.

Cajamarca is also a centre of higher education in the northern Peruvian Andes. The city hosts two local universities: Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca (National University of Cajamarca), a public university, while Universidad Antonio Guillermo Urrelo is a private one. Five other universities have branches in Cajamarca: Universidad Antenor Orrego, Universidad San Pedro, Universidad Alas Peruanas, Universidad Los Angeles de Chimbote and Universidad Privada del Norte.

== Culture ==

Cajamarca is home to the annual celebration of &quot;Carnaval&quot;, a time when the locals celebrate Carnival before the beginning of Lent. Carnival celebrations are full of parades, autochthonous dances and other cultural activities. A local Carnival custom is to spill water and/or some paint among friends or bypassers. During late January and early February this turns into an all-out water war between men and women (mostly between the ages of 6 and 25) who use buckets of water and water balloons to douse members of the opposite sex. Stores everywhere carry packs of water balloons during this time, and it is common to see wet spots on the pavement and groups of young people on the streets looking for &quot;targets&quot;.

<text>A secondary school or high school is an institution that provides secondary education. Some secondary schools provide both &quot;lower secondary education&quot; (ages 11 to 14) and &quot;upper secondary education&quot; (ages 14 to 18), i.e., both levels 2 and 3 of the ISCED scale, but these can also be provided in separate schools. There may be other variations in the provision: for example, children in Australia, Hong Kong, and Spain change from the primary to secondary systems a year later at the age of 12, with the ISCED&#x27;s first year of lower secondary being the last year of primary provision.

In the United States, most local secondary education systems have separate middle schools and high schools. In the United Kingdom, most state schools and privately funded schools accommodate pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 or between 11 and 18; some UK private schools, i.e. public schools, admit pupils between the ages of 13 and 18. 

Secondary schools follow on from primary schools and prepare for vocational or tertiary education. In high and middle income countries, attendance is usually compulsory for students at least until age 16. The organisations, buildings, and terminology are more or less unique in each country.

==Levels of education==
In the ISCED 2014 education scale, levels 2 and 3 correspond to secondary education which are as follows:

; Lower secondary education: First stage of secondary education building on primary education, typically with a more subject-oriented curriculum. Students are generally around 11–16 years old.
; Upper secondary education: Second stage of secondary education and final stage of formal education for students typically aged 16–18, preparing for tertiary/adult education or providing skills relevant to employment, usually with an increased range of subject options and streams.

==Terminology: descriptions of cohorts==
Within the English-speaking world, there are three widely used systems to describe the age of the child. The first is the &#x27;equivalent ages&#x27;; then countries that base their education systems on the &#x27;English model&#x27; use one of two methods to identify the year group, while countries that base their systems on the &#x27;American K–12 model&#x27; refer to their year groups as &#x27;grades&#x27;. The Irish model is structured similarly to the English model, but differs significantly in terms of labels. This terminology extends into the research literature. Below is a comparison of some countries:
==Legal framework==
Schools exist within a strict legal framework where they may be answerable to their government through local authorities and their stakeholders. In England (but necessarily in other parts of the United Kingdom) there are six general types of state-funded schools running in parallel to the private sector. The state takes an interest in safeguarding issues in all schools. All state-funded schools in England are legally required to have a website where they must publish details of their governance, finance, curriculum intent and staff and pupil protection policies to comply with &quot;The School Information (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 and 2016&quot;. Ofsted monitors these.

==Theoretical framework==
School building design does not happen in isolation. The building or school campus needs to accommodate:
* Curriculum content
* Teaching methods
* Costs
* Education within the political framework
* Use of school building (also in the community setting)
* Constraints imposed by the site
* Design philosophy

Each country will have a different education system and priorities. Schools need to accommodate students, staff, storage, mechanical and electrical systems, support staff, ancillary staff and administration. The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.

According to standards used in the United Kingdom, a general classroom for 30 students needs to be 55 m2, or more generously 62 m2. A general art room for 30 students needs to be 83 m2, but 104 m2 for 3D textile work. A drama studio or a specialist science laboratory for 30 needs to be 90 m2. Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 1,200 place secondary (practical specialism). and 1,850 place secondary school.

==Size ==
The ideal size for a typical comprehensive high school is large enough to offer a variety of classes, but small enough that students develop a sense of community. Research has suggested that academic achievement is best when there are about 150 to 250 students in each grade level, and that above a total school size of 2,000 for a secondary school, academic achievement and the sense of school community decline substantially.

Arguments in favor of smaller schools include having a shared experience of school (e.g., everyone takes the same classes, because the school is too small to offer alternatives), higher average academic achievement, and lower inequality.

Arguments in favor of larger schools tend to focus on economy of scale. For example, a single basketball court could serve a school with 200 students just as well as a school with 500 students, so construction and maintenance costs, on a per-student basis, can be lower for larger schools. However, cost savings from larger schools have generally not materialized, as larger schools require more administrative support staff, and rural areas see the potential savings offset by increased transportation costs.

Larger schools can also support more specialization, such as splitting students into advanced, average, and basic tracks, offering a greater variety of classes, or sponsoring a greater number of extra-curricular activities. (Some of these benefits can also be achieved through smaller but specialized schools, such as a dedicated special school for students with disabilities or a magnet school for students with a particular subject-matter interest.)

In terms of structure, organization, and relationships, larger schools tend to be more hierarchical and bureaucratic, with fewer and weaker personal connections and more rigidly defined, unvarying roles for all staff. Teachers find that large schools result in more information to process in the larger environment (e.g., announcements about 100 programs instead of just 10) and that as individuals they form fewer relationships with teachers outside of their primary subject area. Smaller schools have less social isolation and more engagement. These effects cannot be entirely overcome through implementation of a house system or &quot;school within a school&quot; programs.

==Building design specifications ==
The building providing the education has to fulfill the needs of: students, teachers, non-teaching support staff, administrators and the community. It has to meet general government building guidelines, health requirements, minimal functional requirements for classrooms, toilets and showers, electricity and services, preparation and storage of textbooks and basic teaching aids. An optimum secondary school will meet the minimum conditions and will have:

* adequately-sized classrooms;
* specialized teaching spaces;
* a staff preparation room;
* an administration block;
* multipurpose classrooms;
* a general purpose school hall;
* laboratories for science, technology, mathematics and life sciences, as may be required;
* adequate equipment;
* a library or library stocks that are regularly renewed; and
* computer rooms or media centres.

Also, a secondary school may have a canteen, serving a set of foods to students, and storage where the equipment of a school is kept.

Government accountants having read the advice then publish minimum guidelines on schools. These enable environmental modelling and establishing building costs. Future design plans are audited to ensure that these standards are met but not exceeded. Government ministries continue to press for the &#x27;minimum&#x27; space and cost standards to be reduced.

The UK government published this downwardly revised space formula in 2014. It said the floor area should be 1050 m2 (+ 350 m2 if there is a sixth form) + 6.3 m2/pupil place for 11- to 16-year-olds + 7 m2/pupil place for post-16s. The external finishes were to be downgraded to meet a build cost of £1113/m2.

== By country ==
A secondary school locally may be called a high school (abbreviated as HS or H.S.), can also be called senior high school. In some countries there are two phases to secondary education (ISCED 2) and (ISCED 3), here the junior high school, intermediate school, lower secondary school, or middle school occurs between the primary school (ISCED 1) and high school.

<text>In null-hypothesis significance testing, the &quot;p&quot;-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. A very small &quot;p&quot;-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely &quot;under the null hypothesis&quot;. Even though reporting &quot;p&quot;-values of statistical tests is common practice in academic publications of many quantitative fields, misinterpretation and misuse of p-values is widespread and has been a major topic in mathematics and metascience. 

In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) made a formal statement that &quot;&quot;p&quot;-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone&quot; and that &quot;a &quot;p&quot;-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result&quot; or &quot;evidence regarding a model or hypothesis&quot;. That said, a 2019 task force by ASA has issued a statement on statistical significance and replicability, concluding with: &quot;&quot;p&quot;-values and significance tests, when properly applied and interpreted, increase the rigor of the conclusions drawn from data&quot;.

== Basic concepts ==
In statistics, every conjecture concerning the unknown probability distribution of a collection of random variables representing the observed data formula_1 in some study is called a &quot;statistical hypothesis&quot;. If we state one hypothesis only and the aim of the statistical test is to see whether this hypothesis is tenable, but not to investigate other specific hypotheses, then such a test is called a null hypothesis test.

As our statistical hypothesis will, by definition, state some property of the distribution, the null hypothesis is the default hypothesis under which that property does not exist. The null hypothesis is typically that some parameter (such as a correlation or a difference between means) in the populations of interest is zero. Our hypothesis might specify the probability distribution of formula_1 precisely, or it might only specify that it belongs to some class of distributions. Often, we reduce the data to a single numerical statistic, e.g., formula_3, whose marginal probability distribution is closely connected to a main question of interest in the study.

The &quot;p&quot;-value is used in the context of null hypothesis testing in order to quantify the statistical significance of a result, the result being the observed value of the chosen statistic formula_3. The lower the &quot;p&quot;-value is, the lower the probability of getting that result if the null hypothesis were true. A result is said to be &quot;statistically significant&quot; if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. All other things being equal, smaller &quot;p&quot;-values are taken as stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

Loosely speaking, rejection of the null hypothesis implies that there is sufficient evidence against it.

As a particular example, if a null hypothesis states that a certain summary statistic formula_3 follows the standard normal distribution formula_6 then the rejection of this null hypothesis could mean that (i) the mean of formula_3 is not 0, or (ii) the variance of formula_3 is not 1, or (iii) formula_3 is not normally distributed. Different tests of the same null hypothesis would be more or less sensitive to different alternatives. However, even if we do manage to reject the null hypothesis for all 3 alternatives, and even if we know that the distribution is normal and variance is 1, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero values of the mean are now most plausible. The more independent observations from the same probability distribution one has, the more accurate the test will be, and the higher the precision with which one will be able to determine the mean value and show that it is not equal to zero; but this will also increase the importance of evaluating the real-world or scientific relevance of this deviation.

== Definition and interpretation ==

=== Definition ===

The &quot;p&quot;-value is the probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining a real-valued test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained. Consider an observed test-statistic formula_10 from unknown distribution formula_3. Then the &quot;p&quot;-value formula_12 is what the prior probability would be of observing a test-statistic value at least as &quot;extreme&quot; as formula_10 if null hypothesis formula_14 were true. That is:
* formula_15 for a one-sided right-tail test-statistic distribution.
* formula_16 for a one-sided left-tail test-statistic distribution.
* formula_17 for a two-sided test-statistic distribution. If the distribution of formula_3 is symmetric about zero, then formula_19

=== Interpretations ===

In a significance test, the null hypothesis formula_14 is rejected if the &quot;p&quot;-value is less than or equal to a predefined threshold value formula_21, which is referred to as the alpha level or significance level. formula_21 is not derived from the data, but rather is set by the researcher before examining the data. formula_21 is commonly set to 0.05, though lower alpha levels are sometimes used. The 0.05 value (equivalent to 1/20 chances) was originally proposed by R. Fisher in 1925 in his famous book entitled &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot;. In 2018, a group of statisticians led by Daniel Benjamin proposed the adoption of the 0.005 value as standard value for statistical significance worldwide.

Different &quot;p&quot;-values based on independent sets of data can be combined, for instance using Fisher&#x27;s combined probability test.

=== Distribution ===

The &quot;p&quot;-value is a function of the chosen test statistic formula_3 and is therefore a random variable. If the null hypothesis fixes the probability distribution of formula_3 precisely (e.g. formula_26 where formula_27 is the only parameter), and if that distribution is continuous, then when the null-hypothesis is true, the &quot;p&quot;-value is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Regardless of the truth of the formula_14, the &quot;p&quot;-value is not fixed; if the same test is repeated independently with fresh data, one will typically obtain a different &quot;p&quot;-value in each iteration.

Usually only a single &quot;p&quot;-value relating to a hypothesis is observed, so the &quot;p&quot;-value is interpreted by a significance test, and no effort is made to estimate the distribution it was drawn from. When a collection of &quot;p&quot;-values are available (e.g. when considering a group of studies on the same subject), the distribution of &quot;p&quot;-values is sometimes called a &quot;p&quot;-curve.
A &quot;p&quot;-curve can be used to assess the reliability of scientific literature, such as by detecting publication bias or &quot;p&quot;-hacking.
=== Distribution for composite hypothesis===

In parametric hypothesis testing problems, a &quot;simple or point hypothesis&quot; refers to a hypothesis where the parameter&#x27;s value is assumed to be a single number. In contrast, in a &quot;composite hypothesis&quot; the parameter&#x27;s value is given by a set of numbers. When the null-hypothesis is composite (or the distribution of the statistic is discrete), then when the null-hypothesis is true the probability of obtaining a &quot;p&quot;-value less than or equal to any number between 0 and 1 is still less than or equal to that number. In other words, it remains the case that very small values are relatively unlikely if the null-hypothesis is true, and that a significance test at level formula_21 is obtained by rejecting the null-hypothesis if the &quot;p&quot;-value is less than or equal to formula_21.

For example, when testing the null hypothesis that a distribution is normal with a mean less than or equal to zero against the alternative that the mean is greater than zero (formula_31, variance known), the null hypothesis does not specify the exact probability distribution of the appropriate test statistic. In this example that would be the &quot;Z&quot;-statistic belonging to the one-sided one-sample &quot;Z&quot;-test. For each possible value of the theoretical mean, the &quot;Z&quot;-test statistic has a different probability distribution. In these circumstances the &quot;p&quot;-value is defined by taking the least favorable null-hypothesis case, which is typically on the border between null and alternative. 
This definition ensures the complementarity of p-values and alpha-levels: formula_32 means one only rejects the null hypothesis if the &quot;p&quot;-value is less than or equal to formula_33, and the hypothesis test will indeed have a &quot;maximum&quot; type-1 error rate of formula_33.

== Usage ==
The &quot;p&quot;-value is widely used in statistical hypothesis testing, specifically in null hypothesis significance testing. In this method, before conducting the study, one first chooses a model (the null hypothesis) and the alpha level &quot;α&quot; (most commonly 0.05). After analyzing the data, if the &quot;p&quot;-value is less than &quot;α&quot;, that is taken to mean that the observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis for the null hypothesis to be rejected. However, that does not prove that the null hypothesis is false. The &quot;p&quot;-value does not, in itself, establish probabilities of hypotheses. Rather, it is a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.

=== Misuse ===

According to the ASA, there is widespread agreement that &quot;p&quot;-values are often misused and misinterpreted. One practice that has been particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any &quot;p&quot;-value nominally less than 0.05 without other supporting evidence. Although &quot;p&quot;-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as &quot;the design of a study, the quality of the measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis&quot;. Another concern is that the &quot;p&quot;-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

Some statisticians have proposed abandoning &quot;p&quot;-values and focusing more on other inferential statistics, such as confidence intervals, likelihood ratios, or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on the feasibility of these alternatives. Others have suggested to remove fixed significance thresholds and to interpret &quot;p&quot;-values as continuous indices of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Yet others suggested to report alongside &quot;p&quot;-values the prior probability of a real effect that would be required to obtain a false positive risk (i.e. the probability that there is no real effect) below a pre-specified threshold (e.g. 5%).

That said, in 2019 a task force by ASA had convened to consider the use of statistical methods in scientific studies, specifically hypothesis tests and &quot;p&quot;-values, and their connection to replicability. It states that &quot;Different measures of uncertainty can complement one another; no single measure serves all purposes&quot;, citing &quot;p&quot;-value as one of these measures. They also stress that &quot;p&quot;-values can provide valuable information when considering the specific value as well as when compared to some threshold. In general, it stresses that &quot;&quot;p&quot;-values and significance tests, when properly applied and interpreted, increase the rigor of the conclusions drawn from data&quot;.

== Calculation ==
Usually, formula_3 is a test statistic. A test statistic is the output of a scalar function of all the observations. This statistic provides a single number, such as a &quot;t&quot;-statistic or an &quot;F&quot;-statistic. As such, the test statistic follows a distribution determined by the function used to define that test statistic and the distribution of the input observational data.

For the important case in which the data are hypothesized to be a random sample from a normal distribution, depending on the nature of the test statistic and the hypotheses of interest about its distribution, different null hypothesis tests have been developed. Some such tests are the &quot;z&quot;-test for hypotheses concerning the mean of a normal distribution with known variance, the &quot;t&quot;-test based on Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-distribution of a suitable statistic for hypotheses concerning the mean of a normal distribution when the variance is unknown, the &quot;F&quot;-test based on the &quot;F&quot;-distribution of yet another statistic for hypotheses concerning the variance. For data of other nature, for instance, categorical (discrete) data, test statistics might be constructed whose null hypothesis distribution is based on normal approximations to appropriate statistics obtained by invoking the central limit theorem for large samples, as in the case of Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test.

Thus computing a &quot;p&quot;-value requires a null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), but, in the early and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated &quot;p&quot;-values from these discrete values. Rather than using a table of &quot;p&quot;-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed &quot;p&quot;-values; this corresponds to computing the quantile function (inverse CDF).

==Example==
=== Testing the fairness of a coin ===
As an example of a statistical test, an experiment is performed to determine whether a coin flip is fair (equal chance of landing heads or tails) or unfairly biased (one outcome being more likely than the other).

Suppose that the experimental results show the coin turning up heads 14 times out of 20 total flips. The full data formula_1 would be a sequence of twenty times the symbol &quot;H&quot; or &quot;T&quot;. The statistic on which one might focus could be the total number formula_3 of heads. The null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, and coin tosses are independent of one another. If a right-tailed test is considered, which would be the case if one is actually interested in the possibility that the coin is biased towards falling heads, then the &quot;p&quot;-value of this result is the chance of a fair coin landing on heads &quot;at least&quot; 14 times out of 20 flips. That probability can be computed from binomial coefficients as

: formula_38

This probability is the &quot;p&quot;-value, considering only extreme results that favor heads. This is called a one-tailed test. However, one might be interested in deviations in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed &quot;p&quot;-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided &quot;p&quot;-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided &quot;p&quot;-value: the two-sided &quot;p&quot;-value is 0.115.

In the above example:
* Null hypothesis (&quot;H&quot;0): The coin is fair, with Pr(heads) = 0.5.
* Test statistic: Number of heads.
* Alpha level (designated threshold of significance): 0.05.
* Observation &quot;O&quot;: 14 heads out of 20 flips.
* Two-tailed &quot;p&quot;-value of observation &quot;O&quot; given &quot;H&quot;0 = 2 × min(Pr(no. of heads ≥ 14 heads), Pr(no. of heads ≤ 14 heads)) = 2 × min(0.058, 0.978) = 2 × 0.058 = 0.115.

The Pr(no. of heads ≤ 14 heads) = 1 − Pr(no. of heads ≥ 14 heads) + Pr(no. of head = 14) = 1 − 0.058 + 0.036 = 0.978; however, the symmetry of this binomial distribution makes it an unnecessary computation to find the smaller of the two probabilities. Here, the calculated &quot;p&quot;-value exceeds 0.05, meaning that the data falls within the range of what would happen 95% of the time, if the coin were fair. Hence, the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 0.05 level.

However, had one more head been obtained, the resulting &quot;p&quot;-value (two-tailed) would have been 0.0414 (4.14%), in which case the null hypothesis would be rejected at the 0.05 level.

==== Optional stopping ====
The difference between the two meanings of &quot;extreme&quot; appear when we consider a sequential hypothesis testing, or optional stopping, for the fairness of the coin. In general, optional stopping changes how p-value is calculated. Suppose we design the experiment as follows:
* Flip the coin twice. If both comes up heads or tails, end the experiment.
* Else, flip the coin 4 more times.

This experiment has 7 types of outcomes: 2 heads, 2 tails, 5 heads 1 tail, ..., 1 head 5 tails. We now calculate the &quot;p&quot;-value of the &quot;3 heads 3 tails&quot; outcome.

If we use the test statistic formula_39, then under the null hypothesis is exactly 1 for two-sided &quot;p&quot;-value, and exactly formula_40 for one-sided left-tail &quot;p&quot;-value, and same for one-sided right-tail &quot;p&quot;-value.

If we consider every outcome that has equal or lower probability than &quot;3 heads 3 tails&quot; as &quot;at least as extreme&quot;, then the &quot;p&quot;-value is exactly formula_41

However, suppose we have planned to simply flip the coin 6 times no matter what happens, then the second definition of &quot;p&quot;-value would mean that the &quot;p&quot;-value of &quot;3 heads 3 tails&quot; is exactly 1.

Thus, the &quot;at least as extreme&quot; definition of &quot;p&quot;-value is deeply contextual and depends on what the experimenter &quot;planned&quot; to do even in situations that did not occur.

==History==

&quot;P&quot;-value computations date back to the 1700s, where they were computed for the human sex ratio at birth, and used to compute statistical significance compared to the null hypothesis of equal probability of male and female births. John Arbuthnot studied this question in 1710, and examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710. In every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. Considering more male or more female births as equally likely, the probability of the observed outcome is 1/282, or about 1 in 4,836,000,000,000,000,000,000,000; in modern terms, the &quot;p&quot;-value. This is vanishingly small, leading Arbuthnot to conclude that this was not due to chance, but to divine providence: &quot;From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.&quot; In modern terms, he rejected the null hypothesis of equally likely male and female births at the &quot;p&quot; = 1/282 significance level. This and other work by Arbuthnot is credited as &quot;… the first use of significance tests …&quot; the first example of reasoning about statistical significance, and &quot;… perhaps the first published report of a nonparametric test …&quot;, specifically the sign test; see details at .

The same question was later addressed by Pierre-Simon Laplace, who instead used a &quot;parametric&quot; test, modeling the number of male births with a binomial distribution:
The &quot;p&quot;-value was first formally introduced by Karl Pearson, in his Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test, using the chi-squared distribution and notated as capital P. The &quot;p&quot;-values for the chi-squared distribution (for various values of χ2 and degrees of freedom), now notated as &quot;P,&quot; were calculated in , collected in .

Ronald Fisher formalized and popularized the use of the &quot;p&quot;-value in statistics, with it playing a central role in his approach to the subject. In his highly influential book &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot; (1925), Fisher proposed the level &quot;p&quot; = 0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applied this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance (see 68–95–99.7 rule).

He then computed a table of values, similar to Elderton but, importantly, reversed the roles of χ2 and &quot;p.&quot; That is, rather than computing &quot;p&quot; for different values of χ2 (and degrees of freedom &quot;n&quot;), he computed values of χ2 that yield specified &quot;p&quot;-values, specifically 0.99, 0.98, 0.95, 0,90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.50, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01. That allowed computed values of χ2 to be compared against cutoffs and encouraged the use of &quot;p&quot;-values (especially 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01) as cutoffs, instead of computing and reporting &quot;p&quot;-values themselves. The same type of tables were then compiled in , which cemented the approach.

As an illustration of the application of &quot;p&quot;-values to the design and interpretation of experiments, in his following book &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot; (1935), Fisher presented the lady tasting tea experiment, which is the archetypal example of the &quot;p&quot;-value.

To evaluate a lady&#x27;s claim that she (Muriel Bristol) could distinguish by taste how tea is prepared (first adding the milk to the cup, then the tea, or first tea, then milk), she was sequentially presented with 8 cups: 4 prepared one way, 4 prepared the other, and asked to determine the preparation of each cup (knowing that there were 4 of each). In that case, the null hypothesis was that she had no special ability, the test was Fisher&#x27;s exact test, and the &quot;p&quot;-value was formula_42 so Fisher was willing to reject the null hypothesis (consider the outcome highly unlikely to be due to chance) if all were classified correctly. (In the actual experiment, Bristol correctly classified all 8 cups.)

Fisher reiterated the &quot;p&quot; = 0.05 threshold and explained its rationale, stating:

He also applies this threshold to the design of experiments, noting that had only 6 cups been presented (3 of each), a perfect classification would have only yielded a &quot;p&quot;-value of formula_43 which would not have met this level of significance. Fisher also underlined the interpretation of &quot;p,&quot; as the long-run proportion of values at least as extreme as the data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

In later editions, Fisher explicitly contrasted the use of the &quot;p&quot;-value for statistical inference in science with the Neyman–Pearson method, which he terms &quot;Acceptance Procedures&quot;. Fisher emphasizes that while fixed levels such as 5%, 2%, and 1% are convenient, the exact &quot;p&quot;-value can be used, and the strength of evidence can and will be revised with further experimentation. In contrast, decision procedures require a clear-cut decision, yielding an irreversible action, and the procedure is based on costs of error, which, he argues, are inapplicable to scientific research.

The &quot;E-value&quot; can refer to two concepts, both of which are related to the p-value and both of which play a role in multiple testing. First, it corresponds to a generic, more robust alternative to the p-value that can deal with &quot;optional continuation&quot; of experiments. Second, it is also used to abbreviate &quot;expect value&quot;, which is the expected number of times that one expects to obtain a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed if one assumes that the null hypothesis is true. This expect-value is the product of the number of tests and the &quot;p&quot;-value.

The &quot;q&quot;-value is the analog of the &quot;p&quot;-value with respect to the positive false discovery rate. It is used in multiple hypothesis testing to maintain statistical power while minimizing the false positive rate.

The Probability of Direction (&quot;pd&quot;) is the Bayesian numerical equivalent of the &quot;p&quot;-value. It corresponds to the proportion of the posterior distribution that is of the median&#x27;s sign, typically varying between 50% and 100%, and representing the certainty with which an effect is positive or negative.

Second-generation p-values extend the concept of p-values by not considering extremely small, practically irrelevant effect sizes as significant.

<text>Séamus Pattison (19 April 1936 – 4 February 2018) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 2002 to 2007, Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1997 to 2002, Minister of State for Social Welfare from 1983 to 1987 and Father of the Dáil from 1995 to 2007. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency from 1961 to 2007. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Leinster constituency from 1981 to 1983.

==Early life and education==
Séamus Pattison was born in Kilkenny in 1936. His father was Labour Party TD James Pattison, who represented Carlow–Kilkenny from 1933 to 1957. After his education at University College Cork, Pattison became a full-time trade union official, serving with the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU).

==Career==
Pattison unsuccessfully contested the Carlow–Kilkenny by-election for Labour in June 1960, but was elected at the 1961 general election to the 17th Dáil, and held the seat at eleven further general elections.

He served as Mayor of Kilkenny on three occasions; 1967, 1976 and 1992. He became an MEP for Leinster in 1981, to replace Liam Kavanagh who became Minister for Labour following the 1981 general election. Pattison resigned as an MEP in 1983, following his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, in which position he served until Labour left the government in January 1987.

He was unanimously elected Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann on 26 June 1997, serving for the 28th Dáil. When the 29th Dáil assembled after the 2002 general election he was succeeded by Rory O&#x27;Hanlon, but was appointed as Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy chairperson) for the 29th Dáil.

Pattison was also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

In September 2005, he announced he would retire at the following general election, and his nephew Eoin Pattison unsuccessfully sought the nomination. Labour county councillor Michael O&#x27;Brien was selected in February 2006 to contest the seat, but was unsuccessful in the 2007 general election.

==Later life and death==
When Pattison retired from politics at the 2007 election he had served in Dáil Éireann for 45 years and 7 months, making him the fifth-longest serving TD ever, and the longest-ever-serving Labour Party TD. He was the longest-serving sitting TD from 1995 to 2007, and had the informal title of Father of the Dáil.

Pattison died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home in Kilkenny on 4 February 2018, aged 81.

<text>Ayacucho (, , derived from the words &quot;aya&quot; (&quot;death&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;) and &quot;k&#x27;uchu&quot; (&quot;corner&quot;) in honour of the battle of Ayacucho), founded in 1540 as San Juan de la Frontera de Huamanga and known simply as Huamanga (Quechua: Wamanga) until 1825, is the capital city of Ayacucho Region and of Huamanga Province, Ayacucho Region, Peru.

Its original name, which continues to be the alternative name of the city, dates back to the Incan and Viceregal periods of its history, until its official change by Simón Bolívar in 1825 through a decree to commemorate the battle of Ayacucho during the Peruvian War of Independence. Bolívar issued the decree on February 15, 1825, changing the name from &quot;Huamanga&quot; to &quot;Ayacucho&quot;, after the battle that decisively established the total independence of the nascent Peruvian Republic.

Ayacucho is famous for its 33 churches, which represent one for each year of Jesus&#x27; life. Ayacucho has large religious celebrations, especially during the Holy Week of Easter. These celebrations include horse races featuring Peruvian Caballos de Paso and the traditional running of the bulls, known locally as the &quot;jalatoro&quot; or &quot;pascuatoro&quot;. The &quot;jalatoro&quot; is similar to the Spanish &quot;encierro&quot;, except that the bulls are led by horses of the Morochucos.

==History==

=== Early settlements ===
Vestiges of human settlements more than 15,000 years old have been found at the site of Pikimachay, about 25 km north of Ayacucho. From 500 to 900, the region was occupied by the Wari culture, which became known as the first expansionist empire based in the Andes before the Inca Empire.
The Ayacucho region was inhabited by varying indigenous cultures for thousands of years. During the Early Intermediate period (200 BC – 600 AD) the Nazca culture settled in the south-west, and the Warpa culture arose in the center of the Ayacucho region, the Wari Empire emerged as Huarpa cultures interacted with the nearby Nasca Culture at a time of intense interregional exchanges and widespread disruption to existing cultural traditions. During the Middle Horizon period (600 – 1000 AD), at its zenith the Wari state reigned over most of the highlands and coast of Peru, centered near the present-day city of Ayacucho (Huamanga), the Wari became the largest dominant culture in the Andes region before the Inca came into existence. The Wari civilization collapsed by about 1000 AD, and the capital city of Wari was abandoned.

With the end of the Wari culture, the Late Intermediate period (1000 AD – 1476 AD) is said to begin, while some post-Wari cultures continued to further develop during this era, particularly cultures from coastal Peru, the Late Intermediate era is marked by population decline and substantial cultural regression over extensive areas of the Peruvian highlands, the Ayacucho region became one of the most affected areas, urban planning ceased to be, people abandoned virtually all cities, if not all, and dispersed into rural hamlets. New tribal cultures — well differentiated from the old Wari — arose in the Ayacucho region, over time these became a series of relatively powerful warlike chiefdoms that controlled region, according to colonial chroniclers these tribes were united into a confederacy by the time Inca began to expand, referred in the Spanish accounts as the &quot;Chanca confederacy&quot;, an alliance formed by the Chanca, Parinacocha, Vilca, Sora, and Rucana (Lucana) cultures, among other ayllu clans. After a series of fierce battles the Inca managed to defeat and conquer the Chanka confederacy and integrated the area into the Inca Empire, the Inca founded Vilcashuaman within Vilcas&#x27; culture territory, one of the most populous cities known to have existed in the Inca Empire, capital of the Inca province (wamani) of Vilcas. Huamanga was another of the administrative centers in the region, founded at a place called Pocra.

=== Colonial era ===
The Spanish colonial founding of Huamanga was led by conqueror Francisco Pizarro on April 25, 1540, who named it &quot;San Juan de la Frontera de Huamanga&quot;. Due to the constant Incan rebellion led by Manco Inca Yupanqui against the Spanish in the zone, Pizarro was quick to populate the settlement with a small number of Spaniards brought from Lima and Cusco. On May 17, 1544, by Royal decree, Ayacucho was titled &quot;La Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad de Huamanga&quot; (the most noble and loyal city of Huamanga), the highest designation in the Spanish hierarchy of naming cities. The city&#x27;s main University was founded on July 3, 1677, as San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. Ayacucho was significant in the colonial era for being an administrative center, a stopping-off point between Lima and Cuzco, and the residence of mercury miner from Huancavelica, as well as local land owners.

=== War of independence ===

In 1820, General Juan Antonio Álvarez de Arenales, under the instructions of Don José de San Martín, arrived in the city during the so-called Intermediate Campaign, which sought to attack Lima through the Andes while San Martín did so through the coast. Thus, Arenales declared independence in Huamanga on November 1, 1820.

The Battle of Ayacucho was the last armed clash between the Spanish Army (formed mostly by Peruvian mestizos and indigenous peoples) and independentists during the Peruvian War of Independence, and the independents&#x27; victory ensured independence. Taking place on 9 December 1924, the battle developed in the nearby pampas of La Quinua on December 9, 1824. Independentist forces were led by Antonio José de Sucre, Simón Bolívar&#x27;s lieutenant. Viceroy José de la Serna e Hinojosa was wounded, and after the battle second commander-in-chief José de Canterac signed the final capitulation of the Royalist army. The independent victory sealed the independence of Peru and South America. La Paz, now the seat of government of Bolivia, was similarly renamed &quot;La Paz de Ayacucho&quot; following this battle.

On February 15, 1825, Simón Bolívar changed the city&#x27;s name to &quot;Ayacucho&quot;, renaming it after the historical Battle of Ayacucho. Upon seeing so many casualties on the battlefield, citizens called the area &quot;Ayakuchu&quot;, &quot;aya&quot; meaning &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;kuchu&quot; meaning &quot;corner&quot; in Ayacucho Quechua.

=== Republican era ===

Although the city gained a new name and some fame, the economy declined following independence. There were attempts to revive the city&#x27;s fortunes, with a planned railway link to Peru&#x27;s network, but the line was terminated in Huancavelica. A highway was subsequently constructed in 1968. The city&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture and light manufacturing, including textiles, pottery, leather goods, and filigree ware. It is a regional tourism destination, known for its 33 churches built in the colonial period, and for the nearby battlefield of La Quinua, where the Ayacucho battle was fought in 1824. The University of San Cristóbal was reopened in 1959. The city&#x27;s population began to increase, but violent political unrest destabilized the region forced migration of many.

In 1980, the far-left terrorist organization known as the Shining Path (&quot;Sendero Luminoso&quot;) used Ayachucho as its base for its campaign against the Peruvian government, even staging an assault on the Ayacucho prison in 1982. The campaign faded after the leader Abimael Guzmán Reynoso was captured in 1992 and put in prison. The region headed by Ayacucho is rural and one of the poorest of all the country. With the peace of the last 15 years, the citizens work hard to improve the living conditions and attract jobs.

Ayacucho is known for its many churches and cathedrals, giving it the name of &quot;The City of Churches&quot;. The oldest Catholic churches date back to the 16th century, when the first religious orders settled in the area. In general, the colonial churches of Ayacucho combine Hispanic, Latin and Arabic elements with indigenous features, such as stones carved with motifs of the local flora and fauna. Some of the most iconic colonial churches includes, the Cathedral Basilica of St. Mary, Templo de Santo Domingo and the Covenent de San Francisco de Asís.

The encomenderos, corregidors, landowners, miners, built their houses in Huamanga, thinking of the mansions in the style of the Spanish cities of Seville, Cordoba, Ávila and Granada of that time. Despite the passage of time, the mansions still retain much of their old elegance. The balconies of these mansions are very iconic, similar to those in said Spanish cities and also to other Peruvian cities such as Trujillo and Lima.

=== Art ===

The richness and quality of Ayacucho&#x27;s crafts, in its various manifestations, have made it be considered as the &quot;Capital of Popular Art and Crafts of Peru&quot;. Ayacucho&#x27;s crafts combine pre-Columbian techniques and traditions with Hispanic contributions and the permanent creativity of the region&#x27;s inhabitants.

<text>Wingdings is a series of dingbat fonts that render letters as a variety of symbols. They were originally developed in 1990 by Microsoft by combining glyphs from Lucida Icons, Arrows, and Stars licensed from Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes. Certain versions of the font&#x27;s copyright string include attribution to Type Solutions, Inc., the maker of a tool used to hint the font.

None of the characters were mapped to Unicode at the time; however, Unicode approved the addition of many symbols in the Wingdings and Webdings fonts in Unicode 7.0.

==Wingdings==
Wingdings is a TrueType dingbat font included in all versions of Microsoft Windows from version 3.1 until Windows Vista/Server 2008, and also in a number of application packages of that era.

The Wingdings trademark is owned by Microsoft, and the design and glyph order was awarded U.S. Design Patent D341848 in 1993. The patent expired in 2007. In many other countries, a Design Patent would be called a &quot;registered design&quot;. It is registration of a design to deter imitation, rather than a claim of a novel invention.

This font contains many largely recognized shapes and gestures as well as some recognized world symbols, such as the Star of David, the symbols of the zodiac, index or manicule signs, hand gestures, and obscure ampersands. 


==Wingdings 2==

Wingdings 2 is a TrueType font distributed with a variety of Microsoft applications, including Microsoft Office up to version 2010. The font was developed in 1990 by Type Solutions, Inc. The current copyright holder is Microsoft Corporation. Among the features of Wingdings 2 are 16 forms of the index, Enclosed Alphanumerics from 0 to 10, multiple forms of ampersand and interrobang, several geometric shapes and an asterism.


==Wingdings 3==
Wingdings 3 is a TrueType dingbat font distributed with Microsoft Office (up to version 2010) and some other Microsoft products.

The font was originally developed in 1990 by Type Solutions, Inc. Since 2006, the copyright holder is Microsoft Corporation. Wingdings 3 consists almost entirely of arrow variations and includes many symbols for keytops as defined in ISO/IEC 9995-7.

==Controversy==
In 1992, only days after the release of Windows 3.1, it was discovered that &quot;NYC&quot; (New York City) in Wingdings was rendered as a skull and crossbones symbol, Star of David, and thumbs up gesture. This was often said to be an antisemitic message referencing New York&#x27;s large Jewish community. Microsoft strongly denied this was intentional, and insisted that the final arrangement of the glyphs in the font was largely random. &quot;NYC&quot; in the later-released Webdings font was intentionally rendered as eye, heart, and city skyline, referring to the I Love New York logo.

After September 11, 2001, an email was circulated claiming that &quot;Q33 NY&quot;, which it claims is the flight number of the first plane to hit the Twin Towers, in Wingdings would bring up a character sequence of a plane flying eastwards, followed by two rectangular paper sheet icons which may be interpreted as skyscrapers, followed by the skull and crossbones symbol and the Star of David. This is a hoax; the flight numbers of the airplanes that hit the towers were AA11 and UA175; the tail numbers were N334AA and N612UA.

==In popular culture==
* In the indie video game &quot;Undertale&quot; made by Toby Fox, a hidden character known as W. D. Gaster uses the Wingdings typeface to speak. Specifically, Gaster uses it to speak during his Lab Entry #17, and on older versions of the &quot;Deltarune&quot; website.
* In a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch in April 2024, Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Wingdings, son of Wingdings&#x27; fictitious creator — Jonathan Wingdings — a dad who was always &quot;hard to read.&quot;

<text>James C. Tunney (25 December 1924 – 16 January 2002) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician.

==Early and personal life==
He was born 25 December 1924 in Finglas, Dublin, the fourth child among three sons and five daughters of James Tunney, a farmer and Labour Party TD and senator, and M. Ellen Tunney (née Grimes), who both came from outside Westport, County Mayo. He was educated at St. Vincent&#x27;s C.B.S. in Glasnevin.

He worked in the Department of Agriculture from 1943 to 1955 and it was in this period that he studied part-time at University College Dublin, where he took a BA in drama, English, and Irish before studying for a postgraduate qualification in Irish. From 1955 to 1962 he taught drama at VECs in Lucan, Balbriggan, and Garretstown, before being appointed headmaster of Blanchardstown VEC in 1962.

He also played at senior level for the Dublin county team. He was on the winning side for Dublin in the 1948 All-Ireland Junior Football Championship.

A snappy dresser who earned the nickname – &quot;the yellow rose of Finglas&quot;, he was sometimes seen as pompous, a perception possibly attributable to his acting background, which once led to an audition for Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre.

==Politics==
In 1963 he joined Fianna Fáil, and stood for the party at the 1965 general election but was not elected. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North-West constituency at the 1969 general election. He served continuously in the Dáil until losing his seat at the 1992 general election, having been a TD for Dublin Finglas from 1977 to 1981 when Dublin constituencies were reconfigured as 3-seaters, before being returned for Dublin North-West in 1981.

During that period he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (after 1978, Minister of State at the Department of Education) in three governments. He served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1981 to 1982, and from 1987 to 1993. He was also chair of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party for ten years. He was a member of Dublin City Council, and served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1984 to 1985.

<doc id="555006" wikidata="Q1043868" url="?curid=555006" title="Carménère">
<text>The Carménère grape is a wine grape variety originally planted in the Médoc region of Bordeaux, France, where it was used to produce deep red wines and occasionally used for blending purposes in the same manner as Petit Verdot.

A member of the Cabernet family of grapes, the name &quot;Carménère&quot; originates from the French word for crimson (&quot;carmin&quot;) which refers to the brilliant crimson colour of the autumn foliage before leaf-fall. The grape is also known as Grande Vidure, a historic Bordeaux synonym, although current European Union regulations prohibit imports under this name into the European Union. Along with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, Carménère is considered one of the original six red grapes of Bordeaux.

Now rarely found in France, the world&#x27;s largest area planted with this variety is in Chile, with more than 8,800 hectares (2009) cultivated in the Central Valley. As such, Chile produces the vast majority of Carménère wines available today and as the Chilean wine industry grows, more experimentation is being carried out on Carménère&#x27;s potential as a blending grape, especially with Cabernet Sauvignon. It is considered the emblematic strain of Chilean wine.

Carménère is also grown in Italy&#x27;s Eastern Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, in Argentina, and in smaller quantities in California and Walla Walla (Washington and Oregon) in the United States.

== History ==

One of the most ancient European varieties, Carménère is thought to be the antecedent of other better-known varieties; some consider the grape to be &quot;a long-established clone of Cabernet Sauvignon&quot;. It is possible that the variety name is an alias for what is actually the Vidure, a local Bordeaux name for a Cabernet Sauvignon clone once thought to be the grape from which all red Bordeaux varieties originated.

There have also been suggestions that Carménère may be Biturica, a vine praised in ancient Rome and also the name by which the city of Bordeaux was known during that era. This ancient variety originated in Iberia (modern-day Spain and Portugal), according to Pliny the Elder; indeed, it is currently a popular blending variety with Sangiovese in Tuscany called &quot;Predicato di Biturica&quot;

The Carménère grape has known origins in the Médoc region of Bordeaux, France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with oidium. It is almost impossible to find Carménère wines in France today, as a phylloxera plague in 1867 nearly destroyed all the vineyards of Europe, afflicting the Carménère grapevines in particular such that for many years the grape was presumed extinct. When the vineyards were replanted, growers could not replant Carménère as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux. The region&#x27;s damp, chilly spring weather gave rise to coulure, &quot;a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal, sometimes cool, wet springs&quot;, which prevented the vine&#x27;s buds from flowering. Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure-susceptible grapes when replanting the vines and Carménère planting was progressively abandoned.

== Countries ==

=== Chile ===

Cuttings of Carménère were imported by Chilean growers from Bordeaux during the 19th century, where they were frequently confused with Merlot vines. They modeled their wineries after those in France and in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux, which included Carménère grape, were planted in the valleys around Santiago. Thanks to central Chile&#x27;s minimal rainfall during the growing season and the protection of the country&#x27;s natural boundaries, growers produced healthier crops of Carménère, and there was no spread of phylloxera. During most of the 20th century Carménère was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes (probably reaching up to 50% of the total volume) giving Chilean Merlot markedly different properties from those of Merlot produced elsewhere. Chilean growers believed that this grape was a clone of Merlot and was known as &quot;Merlot selection&quot; or &quot;Merlot Peumal&quot; (after the Peumo Valley in Chile). In 1994, Carménère was re-discovered as a distinct varietal in Chile by French ampelographist Jean Boursiquot, a researcher at Montpellier&#x27;s school of Oenology. The Chilean Department of Agriculture officially recognized Carménère as a distinct variety in 1998. Today, Carménère grows chiefly in the , Rapel Valley, and Maipo Province.

=== Italy ===
A similar situation occurred in Italy when, in 1990, the Ca&#x27; del Bosco Winery acquired what they thought was Cabernet Franc vines from a French nursery. The growers noticed that the grapes were different from the traditional Cabernet Franc both in color and taste. They also noticed that the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc would have. Other Italian wine regions also started to doubt the origin of these vines and it was finally established to be Carménère. Although, in Italy, the variety is grown mainly in the northeast part of the country from Brescia to Friuli, it has only recently been entered into Italy&#x27;s national catalog of vine varieties and thus &quot;no district has yet requested the authorization to use it&quot;. Therefore, the wine &quot;cannot be cultivated with its original name or specific vintage and the name cannot be used to identify the wine on the label with an IGT, DOC or a DOCG status assignment&quot;. Ca&#x27; del Bosco Winery names the wine it produces &quot;Carmenero&quot;. In 2007 the grape was authorised to be used in Italian DOC wines from Veneto (Arcole, Bagnoli di Sopra, Cori Benedettine del Padovano, Garda, Merlara, Monti Lessini, Riviera del Brenta and Vicenza), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Collio, or Collio Goriziano) and Sardinia (Alghero). Since a ministerial decree of 2009, producers of Piave DOC wines in 50 communes of the Province of Treviso, and 12 in the Province of Venice have been permitted where appropriate to specify the variety Carmenère on the wine label.

=== Other regions ===
In modern-day France only a few hundred acres of Carménère officially exist, although there are rumors of renewed interest among growers in Bordeaux.

Carménère has also been established in Eastern Washington&#x27;s Walla Walla Valley and in California, United States. In the 1980s, Karen Mulander-Magoon, the co-proprietor of Guenoc and Langtry Estates Winery, in California&#x27;s Lake County, brought the grape to the vineyard. This was a joint effort with Louis Pierre Pradier, &quot;a French research scientist and viticulturalist whose work involved preserving Carménère from extinction in France&quot;. Once the vines were quarantined and checked for diseases they were legalized for admission into California in the 1990s, where they were cloned and planted.

In Australia, three cuttings of Carménère were imported from Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart in the late 1990s. After two years in quarantine, only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro-propagated (segments of individual buds grown on nutrient gel) and field grown by Narromine Vine Nursery. The first vines from the nursery were planted in 2002 by Amietta Vineyard and Winery in the Moorabool Valley (Geelong, Victoria) who use Carménère in their Angels&#x27; Share blend.

Carménère has also been established in small amounts in New Zealand. DNA testing confirmed in 2006 that plantings of Cabernet Franc in the Matakana region were in fact Carménère.

Lozärn Wines, situated on Doornbosch farm in the Robertson region of the Western Cape, is the champion of the Carménère grape variety in South Africa. Their first planting of a Carménère vineyard was in 2014. From this vineyard the first single-varietal Carménère was produced in South Africa. Lozärn Wines, owned by the Smuts family, produces both a single-varietal Carménère as well as a rosé Carménère. The estate launched their maiden vintage of the single-varietal Carménère in December 2017 with only 100 bottles, as well as a 100 per cent Carménère Rosé 2017. Lozärn has only half a hectare currently producing the red and rosé, and has another 1.8ha planted. South Africa has only 8.5ha planted of this lost child of Bordeaux.

== Viticulture ==
Carménère favors a long growing season in moderate to warm climates. During harvest time and the winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to high levels of rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.

Carménère is produced in wineries either as a single-variety wine (sometimes called a varietal wine), or as a blend usually with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc or Merlot.

== Distinction from Merlot ==

Genetic research has shown that Carménère may be distantly related to Merlot and the similarities in appearance have linked the two vines for centuries. Despite the similarities, there are some noticeable differences that aid the ampelographer in identifying the two vines. When young, Carménère leaves have a reddish hue underneath, while the leaves of Merlot are white. There are also slight differences in leaf shape with the central lobe of Merlot leaves being longer. Merlot ripens two to three weeks earlier than Carménère. In cases where the vineyards are interspersed with both varieties, the time of harvest is paramount in determining the character of the resulting blends. If Merlot grapes are picked when Carménère is fully ripe, they will be overripe and impart a &quot;jammy&quot; character. If the grapes are picked earlier when only the Merlot grapes have reached ripeness, the Carménère will have an aggressive green pepper flavor.

Thus, although different, Merlot and Carménère were often confused but never thought to be identical. Its distinctive differences meant the grape was called a &quot;Merlot selection&quot; or &quot;Merlot Peumal&quot;, which was &quot;a geographic reference to a valley south of Santiago where lots of Carménère was grown&quot; before its true identity was established.

== Characteristics ==
Carménère wine has a deep red color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon and it is a medium body wine. As a result, many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a blending grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it is young.

<doc id="555013" wikidata="Q7824866" url="?curid=555013" title="Topical decongestant">
<text>Topical decongestants are decongestants applied directly to the nasal cavity. Their effectiveness by themselves in the common cold appears to have a small benefit in adults.

Topical decongestants should only be used by patients for a maximum of 5–7 days in a row, because rebound congestion may occur in the form of rhinitis medicamentosa. When used in adults for a short period of time side effects appear to be few.

==Mechanism of action==
Topical decongestants are vasoconstrictors, and work by constricting the blood vessels within the nasal cavity.

==Examples==
* Ephedrine
* Levmetamfetamine
* Naphazoline
* Oxymetazoline
* Phenylephrine
* Propylhexedrine
* Pseudoephedrine
* Tramazoline
* Xylometazoline

<doc id="555016" wikidata="Q11325920" url="?curid=555016" title="Nobel, Ontario">
<text>Nobel is a village on the shores of Parry Sound, Ontario, Canada. It is in the Municipality of McDougall in the District of Parry Sound. The community is named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.

This village is the administrative office of the Shawanaga First Nation reserve.

==History==
Nobel was across the Sound from Depot Harbour; the two towns benefited from the industrialization brought by the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, later the Canada Atlantic Railway.

During the First World War, Nobel was the home of two explosives factories: The British Cordite Limited and Canadian Explosives Ltd. Both sites closed in 1922. Explosives and munitions were also produced at Nobel in World War II.

===The British Cordite Ltd, Nobel, Ontario===
The British Cordite Limited was built by the Explosives Department of the Imperial Munitions Board to produce Cordite. Construction started in late 1916 and production started in mid 1917. The site covered and had 155 buildings. By 30 November 1918 it had produced 21,450,000 lbs (9,738,300 kg) of Cordite.

===Canadian Explosives Ltd===

Canadian Explosives, jointly owned by du Pont, in the USA, and Nobel&#x27;s Explosives, in Scotland, were already producing Cordite, at Beloeil, for the Quebec Arsenal, before World War I. The capacity of this plant was increased one-hundredfold to 350,000 lbs (159,000 kg) of Cordite per month. In addition, in February 1918, they started to build a Cordite plant at Nobel to produce 1,500,000 lbs (681,000 kg) per month. It was finished on 24 August 1918. During peak production 1,000 people were employed, many of them women.

===World War 2===
At the outbreak of WW2, Defence Industries Limited was founded next to CIL. The plants were operated around the clock and employed 2,000 persons. A typical wage for the winter of 1942-43, for an employee to blend cordite and pack it for shipment to munitions plants elsewhere, was 52 cents per hour.

===Orenda Aerospace===
In the post-war years Orenda Engines had a testing facility, where the Orenda Iroquois turbojet engine was being developed. This engine was slated to power the ill-fated Avro Arrow until the project was cancelled by the Diefenbaker government.

===Highway 400 realignment===
In 2010, a stretch of the new Highway 400 alignment opened up which now bypasses Nobel. Some businesses in the town were affected by the new highway due to a sharp decline in traffic and customers, and had to close down. The former route of Highway 69 through the town was renamed as Nobel Road and reduced in width from four to two lanes, with the decommissioned lanes converted into a recreational trail.

A new access road for nearby access to Exit 236 of Highway 400 was built, and named Avro Arrow Road.

<doc id="555021" wikidata="Q939724" url="?curid=555021" title="Chasselas">
<text>Chasselas () or Chasselas blanc () is a wine grape variety grown mainly in Switzerland, France, Germany, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, New Zealand, Croatia and Chile. Chasselas is mostly vinified to be a full, dry and fruity white wine. It is also suitable as a table grape, grown widely for this purpose in Turkey and Hungary.

==History==

Genetic analyses made in 2009 in a laboratory of the University of Dieppe showed that Chasselas is a grape variety originating in western Switzerland. Its name was first mentioned in the 16th century.

In 1940, Chasselas was crossed with Silvaner to produce the white grape variety Nobling.

==Wine regions==
Chasselas is widely grown in Switzerland, where it has several regional synonym names, the main one being &quot;Fendant&quot; in the canton of Valais. It is considered an ideal pairing for raclette or fondue. Chasselas is also known as &quot;Perlan&quot; in the Mandement district of Geneva. In 2009, it was Switzerland&#x27;s second-most planted grape variety at .

In Germany, with , it is almost exclusively grown in the wine region of Baden under the name &quot;Gutedel&quot;.

In France it is mostly grown in the Loire region, where it is blended with Sauvignon blanc to produce a wine called &quot;Pouilly-sur-Loire&quot;. Californian and Australian growers know this variety under the names &quot;Chasselas Doré&quot; and &quot;Golden Chasselas&quot;.

Michel Chapoutier has stated that he is looking for land for a vineyard in England, which would be planted with Chasselas. He said that he believed Chasselas would suit the English climate and terroir very well.

<text>Haptens (derived from the Greek &quot;haptein&quot;, meaning “to fasten”) are small molecules that elicit an immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein; the carrier may be one that also does not elicit an immune response by itself. The mechanisms of absence of immune response may vary and involve complex immunological interactions, but can include absent or insufficient co-stimulatory signals from antigen-presenting cells.

Haptens have been used to study allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to induce autoimmune-like responses.

The concept of haptens emerged from the work of Austrian immunologist Karl Landsteiner,
who also pioneered the use of synthetic haptens to study immunochemical phenomena.

== Immune reaction on a hapten-carrier adduct ==
Haptens applied on skin, when conjugate with a carrier, could induce contact hypersensitivity, which is a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T cells and dendritic cells. It consists of two phases: sensitization and elicitation. The sensitization phase where the hapten is applied to the skin for the first time is characterized by the activation of innate immune responses, including migration of dendritic cells to the lymph nodes, priming antigen-specific naive T cells, and the generation of antigen-specific effector or memory T cells and B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. The second elicitation phase where the hapten is applied to a different skin area starts with activation of effector T cells followed by T cell-mediated tissue damage and antibody-mediated immune responses. Haptens initially activate innate immune responses by complex mechanisms involving inflammatory cytokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), or the inflammasome.

Once the body has generated antibodies to a hapten-carrier adduct, the small-molecule hapten may also be able to bind to the antibody, but it will usually not initiate an immune response; usually only the hapten-carrier adduct can do this. Sometimes the small-molecule hapten can even block immune response to the hapten-carrier adduct by preventing the adduct from binding to the antibody, a process called &quot;hapten inhibition&quot;.

A well-known example of a hapten is urushiol, which is the toxin found in poison ivy. When absorbed through the skin from a poison ivy plant, urushiol undergoes oxidation in the skin cells to generate the actual hapten, a reactive quinone-type molecule, which then reacts with skin proteins to form hapten adducts. After a second exposure, the proliferated T-cells become activated, generating an immune reaction that produces typical blisters of a urushiol-induced contact dermatitis.

Another example of a hapten-mediated contact dermatitis is nickel allergy, which is caused by nickel metal ions penetrating the skin and binding to skin proteins.

==Examples of haptens==
A lot of haptens are comprised in different kinds of drugs, pesticides, hormones, food toxins etc. Most important factor is the molecular mass, which is &lt;1000 Da.

The first researched haptens were aniline and its carboxyl derivatives (o-, m-, and p-aminobenzoic acid).

Some haptens can induce autoimmune disease. An example is hydralazine, a blood pressure-lowering drug that occasionally can produce drug-induced lupus erythematosus in certain individuals. This also appears to be the mechanism by which the anesthetic gas halothane can cause a life-threatening hepatitis, as well as the mechanism by which penicillin-class drugs cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Other haptens that are commonly used in molecular biology applications include fluorescein, biotin, digoxigenin, and dinitrophenol.

Antibodies have successfully been raised against endogenous &amp; unreactive small molecules such as some neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin (5HT), glutamate, dopamine, GABA, tryptamine, glycine, noradrenaline), amino acids (e.g. tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxytryptophan), by using glutaraldehyde to crosslink these molecules to carrier proteins suitable for immune recognition. Notably, detection of such small molecules in tissues requires the tissue to be glutaraldehyde-fixed, as the glutaraldehyde covalent-linkage on the molecule of interest often forms a portion of the antibody recognized epitope.

==Hapten conjugation==
Due to their nature and properties, hapten-carrier adducts have been essential in immunology. They have been used to evaluate the properties of specific epitopes and antibodies. They are important in the purification and production of monoclonal antibodies. They are also vital in the development of sensitive quantitative and qualitative immunoassays. However, to achieve the best and most desirable results, many factors are needed to be taken into the design of hapten conjugates. These include the method of hapten conjugation, the type of carrier used and the hapten density. Variations in these factors could lead to different strengths of immune response toward the newly formed antigenic determinant.

=== Carriers ===
In general, carrier proteins should be immunogenic and contain enough amino acid residues in the reactive side chains to conjugate with the haptens. For protein haptenation to occur, hapten must be electron deficient (electrophilic), either by itself, or it can be converted to a protein-reactive species for example by air oxidation or cutaneous metabolism. Haptens become fastened to a carrier molecule by a covalent bond. Depending on the haptens being used, other factors in considering the carrier proteins could include their in vivo toxicity, commercial availability and cost.

The most common carriers include serum globulin, albumins, ovalbumin and many others. Human serum albumin (HSA) is often the model protein of choice for protein-binding assays. This is a well-characterized protein, and the role of albumin in blood and tissues &quot;in vivo&quot; is often to bind to xenobiotics via its substrate-binding pockets and remove the invading chemical from the circulation or tissue, thus acting as a detoxification mechanism.

Although proteins are mostly employed for hapten conjugation, synthetic polypeptides such as Poly-L-glutamic acid, polysaccharides and liposomes could also be used.

=== Mechanisms of protein binding ===
Most common reaction mechanisms forming covalent bonds and predicted to be involved in sensitization are nucleophilic substitution on a saturated centre, nucleophilic substitution on an unsaturated centre and nucleophilic addition. Other reactions are also possible, such as electrophilic substitution (diazonium salts), radical reactions, and ionic reactions.

===Methods of hapten conjugation===
While selecting a suitable method for hapten conjugation, functional groups on the hapten and its carrier must be identified. Depending on the groups present, one of the two main strategies could be employed:

#Spontaneous chemical reaction: Used when hapten is a chemical reactive molecule such as anhydrides and isocyanates. This method of conjugation is spontaneous and no cross-linking agents are needed.
#Intermediary molecules cross-linkage: This method mainly applies to nonreactive haptens. Agents with at least two chemically reactive groups such as carbodiimide or glutaraldehyde are to aid the conjugation of haptens to their carriers. The extent of cross-linkage is dependent upon the hapten/carrier to coupling agent ratio, hapten/carrier concentration and the temperature, pH of the environment.
#*Carbodiimide: A group of compounds with a general formula of R-N=C=N-R′, where R and R′ are either aliphatic (i.e., diethylcarbodiimide) or aromatic (i.e., diphenylcarbodiimide). Conjugation using a carbodiimide requires the presence of α or ɛ-amino and a carboxyl group. The amino group usually comes from the lysyl residue of the carrier protein while the carboxyl group comes from the hapten. The exact mechanism for this reaction is still unknown. However, two pathways are proposed. The first postulates that an intermediate that can react with an amine is formed. The second stating that a rearrangement of an acyl urea, the main side product of the reaction at high temperature, has occurred.
#*Glutaraldehyde: This method works by the reaction between glutaraldehyde with amine groups to form Schiff bases or Michael-type double bond addition products. The yield of conjugates can be controlled by varying the pH of the reaction. Higher pH would give rise to more Schiff base intermediates and subsequently lead to the increase in hapten conjugates&#x27; number and size. Overall, cross-linkage involving glutaraldehyde is very stable. However, immunized animals tend to recognize glutaraldehyde&#x27;s cross-linking bridges as epitopes.
# High performance capillary electrophoresis: High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) is an alternative method in optimizing hapten-protein conjugation. HPCE is predominantly used in separating carbohydrates with a very high separation capacity. There are numerous advantages to using HPCE as a technique to investigate certain conjugates such as only requiring minute sample sizes (nl). In addition, the sample used does not need to be pure and no type of radiolabeling is needed. A great benefit to this method of hapten conjugation is that there is automated analysis of sample and the testing of sample interactions can be determined in free solution. This method of hapten-protein conjugation is exceptionally effective with conjugates of low epitope densities, where it is otherwise very challenging by the use of other methods to determine their electrical or ionic mobility.

== Clinical use ==

=== Hapten inhibition ===
Hapten inhibition or &quot;semi-hapten&quot; is the inhibition of a type III hypersensitivity response. In inhibition, free hapten molecules bind with antibodies toward that molecule without causing the immune response, leaving fewer antibodies left to bind to the immunogenic hapten-protein adduct. An example of a &quot;hapten inhibitor&quot; is dextran 1, which is a small fraction (1 kilodalton) of the entire dextran complex, which is enough to bind anti-dextran antibodies, but insufficient to result in the formation of immune complexes and resultant immune responses.

=== Research ===
Haptens are widely used in immunology and related fields. Sensitizing chemicals can cause different forms of allergy, allergic contact dermatitis, or sensitization of the respiratory tract. Interestingly, discrete types of chemicals induce divergent immune responses: contact allergens provoke preferential type I hypersensitivity responses, whereas respiratory allergens stimulate selective type II responses, which could be very suitable for modeling how the immune response is polarized towards different types of antigens.

In allergology, &quot;in vitro&quot;/&quot;in silico&quot; tests for skin sensitization, hazard identification, and potency evaluation on different drug and cosmetic components are highly preferred in early product development. The ability of a drug to act as a hapten is a clear indication of potential immunogenicity.

Hapten-specific antibodies are used in broad area of different immunoassays, immunobiosensor technologies and immunoaffinity chromatography purification columns; those antibodies could be used to detect small environmental contaminants, drugs of abuse, vitamins, hormones, metabolites, food toxins and environmental pollutants.

<doc id="555025" wikidata="Q5044777" url="?curid=555025" title="Carolina bays">
<text>Carolina bays are elliptical to circular depressions concentrated along the East Coast of the United States within coastal New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and north Florida. In Maryland, they are called Maryland basins. Within the Delmarva Peninsula, they and other coastal ponds are also called Delmarva bays.

==Origin of name==
The name &quot;Carolina bay&quot; is sometimes attributed to the writings of the English explorer John Lawson, who explored North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia during the early 18th century. This attribution, however, is not correct. Lawson described visiting a swamp that contained bay trees, but there is no indication that he wanted to name the swamp with the word &quot;bay&quot;. Furthermore, Lawson said that this swamp had steep margins and that he could see mountains to the west from the vicinity of the swamp. Thus, it seems more likely that this swamp was an inter-dune depression among the Carolina Sandhills, rather than a Carolina bay. Nevertheless, bay trees are present in some Carolina bays.

The earliest scientific description of Carolina bays is by L. C. Glenn (1895), who used the term &quot;bay&quot; (which he described as &quot;lake-like expanses&quot;) to refer to these features near the town of Darlington, South Carolina. Glenn put quotation marks around the word &quot;bay&quot; but did not use the phrase &quot;Carolina bay&quot;. A subsequent publication by F.A.Melton and William Schriever (1933) used the phrase &quot;The Carolina Bays&quot; (with quotation marks around the word &quot;Bays&quot;). Later, G. R. MacCarthy (1937) published a paper titled &quot;The Carolina Bays&quot;, using this phrase throughout the publication (without quotation marks, and with a capital &quot;B&quot; for the word &quot;Bays&quot;).

==Geographic extent==
Carolina bays are present in the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain from New York to north Florida. In Maryland, they are called Maryland basins. Within the Delmarva Peninsula, they and other coastal ponds are also called Delmarva bays.

Carolina bays vary in size from one to several thousand acres. About 500,000 of them are present in the classic area of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, many in groups aligned in a northwest–southeast direction. Generally the southeastern end has a higher rim composed of white sand.

===Orientation===
According to published papers and monographs, the average trend of the long axes of Carolina Bays varies from N16°W in east-central Georgia to N22°W in southern South Carolina, N39°W in northern South Carolina, N49°W in North Carolina, and N64°W in Virginia. Within this part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays varies by 10 to 15 degrees. If the long axes of these Carolina bays, as measured by Johnson (1942), are projected westward, then they generally converge in the area of southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio.

At the northern end of the distribution of Carolina bays, within the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey, the average orientation of the long axes abruptly shifts by about 112 degrees to N48°E. Farther north, the orientation of the long axes becomes, at best, distinctly bimodal, exhibiting two greatly divergent directions, and, at worst, completely random, lacking any preferred direction. Plate 3 of Rasmussen and Slaughter, which is reproduced as Figure 51 of Kacrovowski, illustrates the disorganized nature of the orientations of the long axes of Carolina bays in Somerset, Wicomico, and Worcester counties, Maryland.

At the southern end of their distribution, the Carolina bays in southern Georgia and northern Florida are approximately circular in shape. In this area, they have a weak northerly orientation.

==Stratigraphic setting ==
Most Carolina bays consist of a few meters of sand and/or mud that rest on an unconformity above a harder substrate that does not show signs of deformation or other disturbance. The composition and the age of this harder substrate varies from location to location.

Stratigraphic relations of some Carolina bays with fields of eolian dunes in river valleys suggest that Carolina bays formed episodically during different times at different places. For example:

:In some places, Carolina bays are inset into fields of eolian dunes in river valleys, and thus these Carolina bays must be younger than the underlying eolian dunes. One such example is Dukes Pond, which is a Carolina bay that is inset into eolian dunes in the valley of the Ohoopee River (Tattnall County, Georgia). These eolian dunes have yielded an optically stimulated luminescence date of ~23,600 years, and thus this Carolina Bay must be younger than this OSL date. Another example is Bear Swamp, which is a Carolina bay that is inset into eolian dunes in the valley of the Great Pee Dee River (Marion County, South Carolina).

:In other places, Carolina bays are overlain by eolian dunes that are now vegetated, and thus these Carolina bays must be older than the overlying eolian dunes. One such example is Big Bay, which is a Carolina bay that is overlain by eolian dunes in the valley of the Wateree River (Sumter County, South Carolina). These eolian sand dunes at Big Bay have been dated by optically stimulated luminescence techniques at 29,600 ± 2,400 to 33,200 ± 2,800 BP, and thus this Carolina bay must be older than these dates.

==Stratigraphy within the Carolina bays and sand ridges==
Cores taken within several Carolina bays have revealed a stratigraphy of a few meters of sand and/or mud resting on a unconformity above a harder substrate. Carolina bays for which the stratigraphy has been described in some detail include Lake Mattamuskeet (Hyde County, North Carolina), Wilson&#x27;s Bay (Johnston County, North Carolina), Herndon Bay (Robeson County, North Carolina), Big Bay (Sumter County, South Carolina), Flamingo Bay (Aiken County, South Carolina), and Duke&#x27;s Pond (Tattnall County, Georgia).

Lake Mattamuskeet (Hyde County, North Carolina): Cores from within this Carolina bay revealed a 0.3–1.2 m thick unit of sand and silty sand (lacustrine deposits and paleosols) that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of gray clay and sandy clay (with marine shells and burrows) of Pleistocene age. Cores from the adjacent sand rims revealed a 2.6–2.9 m thick unit of silt, sand silt, and silty sand (interpreted as paleosols, shoreline, loess, and eolian deposits) that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of gray clay and sandy clay (with marine shells and burrows) of Pleistocene age (the same unit that was encountered in cores from within the Carolina bay). Charcoal and wood from a western sand rim (closer to the bay) yielded radiocarbon ages of ~5,760 and 1,270 years before present (BP). Organic sediment and charcoal from an eastern sand rim (farther from the bay) yielded radiocarbon ages ranging from ~7,750 to 2,780 years BP.

Wilson&#x27;s Bay (Johnston County, North Carolina): Cores and augers from within this Carolina bay revealed a 1.5–3.2 m thick unit of sand, sandy silt, and silty sand (lacustrine deposits) that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of saprolite (weathered felsic gneiss). These lacustrine deposits yielded a radiocarbon age of ~21,920 years BP. Cores and augers from the adjacent sand rims revealed a 1.5–4.0 m thick unit of muddy sand, sand, and gravel that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of saprolite/weathered felsic gneiss (the same unit that was encountered in cores from within the Carolina bay). Organic material within the bay yielded an age of ~21,920 radiocarbon years BP.

Herndon Bay (Robeson County, North Carolina): Cores drilled into four different sand ridges associated with this Carolina bay revealed that the sand ridges are composed of 2.5–4.5 m thick accumulations of fine to coarse sand that rest on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of black mud of Cretaceous age (Black Creek Formation). Sediment samples from sand rims associated with this Carolina bay have yielded three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of ~36,700 years ago; ~29,600 years ago; and ~27,200 years ago.

Big Bay (Big Bay, Sumter County, South Carolina): A core (drill hole D1/2) drilled within this Carolina bay went through the following units: (1) Drilling depth 0 to 4.5 m = eolian sand sheet that overlies the Carolina bay; (2) Drilling depth 4.5 to 9.0 m = silty sand and sandy mud with abundant organic material; and (3) Drilling depth 9.0 to 10.6 m = sandy clay of Pliocene age (Duplin Formation). Sediment samples from sand rims associated with this Carolina bay have yielded four optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of ~35,700 years ago; ~25,200 years ago; ~11,200 years ago; and ~2,100 years ago.

Within cores of undisturbed sediments recovered from Big Bay, North Carolina, Brook and others documented well-defined pollen zones consisting of distinct pollen assemblages. They found a stratigraphically consistent series of pollen zones, which increased in age consistently with depth from Holocene Stage to the Wisconsin Stage, back into marine isotope stage 5 

Flamingo Bay (Aiken County, South Carolina): A core (C1) taken within this Carolina bay revealed a 0.94 m thick unit of quartz sand that rests on an unconformity (paleosol) above an undisturbed unit of sandy silt and clay of Eocene age. Charcoal samples within the 0.94 m thick unit of quartz sand yielded radiocarbon ages of ~4,500 to 2,500 years BP. A core (P25) taken from adjacent sand rim revealed a 1.85 m thick unit of Quaternary sand that rests on an unconformity (paleosol) above an undisturbed unit of sandy silt and clay of Eocene age (the same unit that was encountered in core C1 from within the Carolina bay). Moore et al. (2012) reported that sediment samples from sand ridges associated with this Carolina bay have yielded five OSL ages of ~15,000 years ago; ~13,100 years ago; ~11,500 years ago; ~9,200 years ago; and ~5,000 years ago. Brooks et al. (2010) reported that sediment samples from sand ridges associated with this Carolina Bay yielded OSL ages of ~108,700 years ago; and ~40,300 years ago.

Duke&#x27;s Pond (Tattnall County, Georgia): A sediment sample from a sand rim at the margin of this Carolina has yielded an OSL age of ~23,600 years ago. Basal peat bog sediment within this Carolina bay yielded an age of ~8,600 radiocarbon years ago.

===Additional notes on stratigraphy===
In a study of several Carolina bays in North Carolina, Gamble et al. (1977) stated that drilling and coring indicated that the bedding and sediments underlying Carolina bays are undisturbed. Studies by Frey, Watts, and Whitehead have also documented that the sediments filling Carolina bays are generally undisturbed. Several cores have found that the sediments that fill Carolina bays have distinct and conformably layers or beds.

The dating of the sand rims of a number of Carolina bays by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques has yielded ages ranging from ~109,000 to ~2,000 years ago, but most ages from the sand rims range from ~40,000 to ~11,000 years ago.

Radiocarbon dates have been obtained from organic matter collected from the undisturbed sediments filling Carolina bays by Bliley and Burney, Mixon and Pilkey, Thom, and Kaczorowski. Some radiocarbon dates obtained from organic matter within undisturbed sediments are greater than 14,000 BP radiocarbon in age. The radiocarbon dates range from 27,700 ±2,600 to 440 ± 50 radiocarbon years BP. Some cores have contained organic matter that was too old for dating by radiocarbon methods, resulting in &quot;greater than&quot; dates. For example, samples from some Carolina bays have been dated at greater than 38,000 to 49,550 radiocarbon years BP. In cases where multiple radiocarbon dates have been determined from a single core, most radiocarbon dates are typically consistent in terms of their stratigraphic position within a core, and accumulation rates calculated from them only are rarely anomalous. Given the nature of radiocarbon dating, discordant dates occasionally occur even in undisturbed deposits, when multiple samples were dated. The occasional discordant dates by themselves are meaningless as an indicator of disturbance. The intact internal stratigraphy of the Carolina bay sediments, as indicated by paleosols and pollen zones (e.g. Big Bay) refutes such arguments.

As discussed by Gaiser, radiocarbon dates reported from any Carolina bay are minimum dates for their formation. The radiocarbon dates only represent times during which organic matter accumulated and was preserved in Carolina bays. At other times, datable organic matter either might not have been preserved as sediment accumulated within them, or older organic matter might have been destroyed when the bays dried out. During times when the water table was below the bottom of a Carolina bay (e.g., possibly during glacial periods when sea level was 130 meters (400 ft) below present), organic matter could have been destroyed by oxidization and weathering. Also, during such times, eolian processes could have eroded any existing sediments at the bottom of Carolina bays. There are some who suggest that the oldest radiocarbon date from a Carolina bay only indicates the time when the water table rose high enough for a permanent lake or swamp to exist within it. This interpretation, however, may depend upon the nature of the overlying sediment. For example, eolian processes can bury and preserve organic matter, and thus the preservation of organic matter can occur independently of water table behavior.

==Ecological significance and biodiversity==

The bays have many different vegetative structures, based on the depression depth, size, hydrology, and subsurface. Many are marshy; a few of the larger ones are (or were before drainage) lakes; Lake Waccamaw is an undrained example. Some bays are predominantly open water with large scattered pond cypress, while others are composed of thick, shrubby areas (pocosins), with vegetation growing on floating peat mats. 
The bays are especially rich in biodiversity, including some rare and/or endangered species. Species that thrive in the bays&#x27; habitats include birds, such as wood storks, herons, egrets, and other migratory waterfowl, mammals such as deer, black bears, raccoons, skunks, and opossums. Other residents include dragonflies, green anoles and green tree frogs.

The bays contain trees such as black gum, bald cypress, pond cypress, sweet bay, loblolly bay, red bay, sweet gum, maple, magnolia, pond pine, and shrubs such as fetterbush, clethra, sumac, button bush, zenobia, and gallberry. Plants common in Carolina bays are water lilies, sedges and various grasses. Several carnivorous plants inhabit Carolina bays, including bladderwort, butterwort, pitcher plant, and sundew.

Some bays have been greatly modified by human activities including farming, highway building, and construction of housing developments and golf courses. For example, Carvers Bay, a large bay in Georgetown County, South Carolina, was used as a bombing practice range during World War II. It has been drained and is mostly used for tree farming today. Others are used for vegetable or field crops with drainage. A study of bays located on the Delmarva peninsula estimated that 70% had been partially or fully converted to agriculture.

In South Carolina, Woods Bay, on the Sumter-Florence county line near Olanta, was designated a state park to preserve it as much as possible in its natural state. Also, 66 Bennett&#x27;s Bay, near Manning, in Clarendon County, South Carolina, is a designated Heritage Preserve.

Another bay in Bamberg County, South Carolina is owned by the South Carolina Native Plant Society, which has been developing a preserve called the Lisa Matthews Memorial Bay, which is trying to preserve and increase the federally endangered wildflower &quot;Oxypolis canbyi&quot; (Canby&#x27;s Dropwort) in the bay. The uplands area surrounding the bay is being restored from a loblolly pine plantation to the original longleaf pine. Included in the longleaf restoration is the restoration of wiregrass (&quot;Aristida beyrichiana&quot;) as a key understory plant. Its flammability aids in periodic burning, which is necessary for Canby&#x27;s Dropwort and many of the other species unique to the environment.

==Interpretations (theories of origin)==
Most geologists today interpret the Carolina bays as relict geomorphological features that developed via various eolian and lacustrine processes. Multiple lines of evidence, e.g. radiocarbon dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and palynology, indicate that the Carolina bays predate the start of the Holocene. Fossil pollen recovered from cores of undisturbed sediment taken from various Carolina bays in North Carolina by Frey, Watts, and Whitehead document the presence of full glacial pollen zones within the sediments filling some Carolina bays. The range of dates can be interpreted that Carolina bays were either created episodically over the last tens of thousands of years or were created at time over a hundred thousand years ago and have since been episodically modified.

===Relict thermokarst lakes===
Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina bays as relict thermokarst lakes that have been modified by eolian and lacustrine processes. Modern thermokarst lakes are common today around Barrow (Alaska), and the long axes of these lakes are oblique to the prevailing wind direction. These lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground, with subsequent modification by wind and waves. Thus, the interpretation of Carolina bays as relict thermokarst lakes implies that frozen ground once extended as far south as the Carolina bays. This interpretation is consistent with the optically stimulated luminescence dates, which suggest that the Carolina bays are relict features that formed when the climate was colder, drier, and windier.

Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists state that the features of the Carolina bays can be readily explained by known terrestrial processes and repeated modification by eolian and lacustrine processes. Also, Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists have found a correspondence in time between when active modification of the rims of Carolina bays most commonly occurred and when adjacent sand dunes were active during the Wisconsin glaciation between 15,000 and 40,000 years (Late Wisconsin) and 70,000 to 80,000 years BP (Early Wisconsin).

In addition, Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists have found that the orientations of the Carolina bays are consistent with the wind patterns that existed during the Wisconsin glaciation, as reconstructed from the orientations of parabolic dunes in river valleys. Within the Atlantic Coast Plain, the orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays and the inferred direction of movement of adjacent sand dunes, where present, are generally oblique to each other. In southern Georgia and northern Florida, the orientation is matched by an inferred west to east direction of movement of Pleistocene sand dunes. Northward from northern Georgia to Virginia, the average inferred direction of movement of Pleistocene parabolic sand dunes systematically shifts along with the average orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays as to lie oblique to them. In the Delmarva Peninsula, the 112 degree shift in the average trend of the long axes also corresponds with a shift in the average inferred direction of movement of Pleistocene parabolic sand dunes such that their direction of movement is also oblique to the long axes, as is the case in the rest of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

===Alternative interpretations===
Alternative interpretations of Carolina bays that are no longer viewed favorably by most geologists include: 
#the action of sea currents when the area was under the ocean;
#the upwelling of ground water at a later time;
#the formation of siliciclastic karst by solution of subsurface material during glacial sealevel lowstands;
#extraterrestrial impact hypotheses: A meteorite impact hypothesis proposed for Carolina bays in a 1933 publication by Melton and Schriever. has been discredited.

==Similar landforms in the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain==
Other landform depressions, not widely accepted as Carolina bays, are present within the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain in southern Mississippi and Alabama, where they are known as either Grady ponds or Citronelle ponds. They are also known by a variety of names such as &quot;pocks&quot;, &quot;pock marks&quot;, , &quot;lacs ronds&quot;, and &quot;natural ponds.&quot; These features in southern Mississippi and Alabama are elliptical to roughly circular in shape. The measurement of the long axes of 200 elliptical Grady / Citronelle ponds in southwestern Baldwin County, Alabama found a very distinct orientation tightly clustered about N25°W.

Undrained depressions, circular to oval in shape and exhibiting a wide range of area and depth, are also a feature of the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain in Texas and southwest Louisiana. These depressions vary in size from in diameter. Within Harris County, Texas, raised rims, which are about high, partially enclose these depressions.

<text>Chenin blanc (, ; known also as Pineau de la Loire among other names) is a white wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means it can be used to make varieties from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine&#x27;s natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire, it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it was historically also known as Steen ( ). The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia, as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby&#x27;s collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia, by 1862.

It provides a fairly neutral palate for the expression of &quot;terroir&quot;, vintage variation, and the winemaker&#x27;s treatment. In cool areas, the juice is sweet but high in acid with a full-bodied, fruity palate. In the unreliable summers of northern France, the acidity of under-ripened grapes was often masked with chaptalization with unsatisfactory results, whereas now, the less-ripened grapes are made into popular sparkling wines such as Crémant de Loire. The white wines of the Anjou AOC are a popular expression of Chenin as a dry wine, with flavors of quince and apples. In nearby Vouvray AOC, vintners aim for an off-dry style, developing honey and floral characteristics with age. In the best vintages, the grapes can be left on the vines to develop noble rot, producing an intense, viscous dessert wine, which may improve considerably with age.

==History==

French ampelographer Pierre Galet has theorized that Chenin blanc originated in the Anjou wine region sometime in the 9th century, and from there traveled to Touraine by at least the 15th century. The grape may have been the variety described in two royal land grants of Charles the Bald in 845 detailed in the records of the abbey of Glanfeuil as growing on the left bank of the Loire River in vineyards belonging to individuals with the name of Soulangé and Bessé.

When Thomas Bohier purchased vineyard land around Chenonceaux on January 3, 1496, several grape varieties were brought in from the Burgundy wine region of Beaune, the Jura wine region of Arbois and nearby Orléans and Anjou. One of these varieties, a white grape known as &quot;Plant d&#x27;Anjou&quot;, was later planted between 1520 and 1535 at a nearby site known as Mont Chenin in Touraine by the Lord of Château de Chenonceau and his brother-in-law, Denis Briçonnet, the abbot of Cormery. Ampelographers believe that &quot;Plant d&#x27;Anjou&quot; was like Chenin blanc, with the grape eventually taking on the name from Mont Chenin.

French writer François Rabelais (1494–1553) wrote glowingly about the white wines of Anjou, and mentions the medicinal qualities of the grapes at the end of chapter XXV of &quot;Gargantua&quot;:

This done, the shepherds and shepherdesses made merry with these cakes and fine grapes, and sported themselves together at the sound of the pretty small pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had that day met with a mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the morning. Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier&#x27;s leg &quot;some fat chenin grapes&quot;, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was quickly cured.

From France, the grape spread to South Africa, where it was most likely included among the vine cuttings sent to Jan van Riebeeck in the Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company. In the 20th century, a subvariety of Chenin planted in the Loire was found to be not actually Chenin blanc at all, but rather the Portuguese grape Verdelho, which is banned from French AOC regulations in the Loire.

===Relationship to other grapes===
In 1999, DNA analysis showed that Chenin blanc has a parent-offspring relationship with the Jura wine grape Savagnin. Additional DNA evidence shows that Chenin blanc shares a sibling relationship with Trousseau and Sauvignon blanc (both grapes the likely offspring of Savagnin), which strongly suggests that Chenin blanc is the offspring and Savagnin is the parent variety. Through Chenin&#x27;s half-sibling relationship with Sauvignon blanc, the grape is related as an aunt/uncle variety to the Bordeaux wine grape Cabernet Sauvignon which is the offspring of Sauvignon blanc and Cabernet Franc.

Other DNA research has shown that a crossing of Chenin and the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc produced several varieties including Balzac blanc, Colombard and Meslier-Saint-François. In South Africa, the grape was crossed with the Italian wine grape Trebbiano to produce Weldra and Chenel.

Over the years, Chenin blanc has also been frequently confused with other grape varieties with which it does not seem to have a close genetic relationship. This includes the Portuguese wine grape Verdelho grown on the island of Madeira Machupiclait and in the Azores, as well as the Spanish wine grape Albillo, which was confused for Chenin blanc in Australia.

==Viticulture==
The Chenin blanc grapevine buds early in the growing season and ripens midway to late in the harvest year. However, in warm years, the balance between the Loire&#x27;s marginal climate and the warmth needed to attain full ripeness has the potential of producing wines with some depth of complexity and finesse. The age of the vine can have an influence on wine quality, with older vines producing naturally lower yields. When infected by noble rot, which also lowers yields and adds and intensifies certain flavors, the wines develop less overtly floral aroma notes, but more depth and layers.

New clonal varieties have been developed that delay budding and increase sugar development during the ripening phase. Six of these new clones have been officially sanctioned by the French government. The vine is semi-upright in habit with three- to five-lobed leaves. It tends to break bud early, with conical, winged bunches containing yellow-green grapes that ripen late. The berries are typically 16.0 mm long x 14.2 mm wide, with an average weight of 1.79 g.

The climate of a wine region largely dictates whether Chenin blanc is produced in a predominantly sweet or dry manner, while the vineyard soil type generally influences the overall style of the wine. Heavy clay-based soils, paired with the right climate, are favorable to the development of weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominantly sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high silex content produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone-based soils encourage wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray, the soil is predominantly &quot;argilo-calcaire&quot; or calcareous clay, which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominantly clay-based soils.

Among the viticultural hazards to which Chenin is susceptible (apart from botrytis in less than ideal conditions) are damage from spring frost, powdery mildew, and fungal disease (such as dead arm of grapevine) that affect the wood structures of the grape vine. Some of these hazards can be managed with integrated pest management and rootstock selection.

===Yields and harvest times===

While true for most wine grape varieties, the quality of Chenin blanc wine is intimately connected to the care taken in the vineyard. If the grapes are harvested too soon, before they ripen, the high acidity results in wine being (according to wine expert Oz Clarke) &quot;one of the nastiest wines possible&quot;. If the grapes are harvested at too high of a yield, the grapes do not retain any of Chenin blanc&#x27;s distinctive character notes. In the Loire, French regulations mandate that yields be kept low (40-50 hl/ha). At these levels, more of Chenin blanc&#x27;s varietal characteristics of floral, honeyed aromas are exhibited. When the grape is harvested at high yields, such as the California Central Valley average of 10 tons per acre (175 hl/ha), Chenin&#x27;s flavors become more bland and neutral. The vine is naturally vigorous and prone to overcropping if not kept in check. In fertile soils, as in parts of South Africa, Chenin blanc can easily produce yields of 240 hl/ha. To keep yields in check, vineyard managers may choose to graft Chenin vines with less vigorous rootstock from &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; or &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; vines. During the growing season, they may also elect to do a green harvest where excess grape clusters are removed.

With optimal ripeness and balance between acidity and sugars being such a viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such as those in the Loire Valley) harvest the grapes in &quot;tries&quot; or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking, only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or &quot;passerillé&quot;, where they could later be affected by noble rot. In areas that experience considerable vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day-by-day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each try going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few could go to sparkling and dry wine production, while the later trie could go towards sweet wine production.

==Wine regions==
While Chenin blanc is planted across the globe from China to New Zealand, Canada, and Argentina, it is considered a &quot;major&quot; planting in only a few locations. Though France is the viticultural home of Chenin blanc, by the turn of the 21st century, twice as much Chenin blanc was planted in South Africa as in France. The grape&#x27;s versatility and ability to reflect &quot;terroir&quot; causes it to lead, as what Jancis Robinson describes, a &quot;double life&quot;. In the Loire Valley of France, it is prized as a premium quality wine grape able to produce world-class wines, while in many New World wine regions, it used as a &quot;workhorse variety&quot;, contributing acidity to bulk white blends and showing more neutral flavors rather than &quot;terroir&quot;. Throughout all its manifestations, Chenin blanc&#x27;s characteristic acidity is found almost universally in all wine regions.

===France===

Ampelographers theorize that Chenin blanc originated in the Loire Valley of France sometime in the 9th century. Today, the Loire is the French wine region most closely associated with the variety. In 2008, of Chenin were planted in France, mostly in the Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher, and Maine-et-Loire departments with the Anjou region around the city of Angers in the Maine-et-Loire having the most significant plantings with in 2008. While Chenin blanc still accounts for around 1.2% of all French plantings, these numbers are a significant drop from the of grapevines that were in cultivation in 1958.

Chenin blanc is an authorized planting in many &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) regions, but is mostly planted in the Middle Loire AOCs of Anjou, Bonnezeaux, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l&#x27;Aubance, Coteaux du Layon, Jasnières, Montlouis, Quarts de Chaume, Saumur, Savennières, and Vouvray. The wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, and Quarts de Chaume are produced as sweet dessert wines, while Savennières produce predominantly dry wines. The wines of Anjou, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l&#x27;Aubance, Jasnières, Montlouis, Saumur, and Vouvray have a wide range of sweetness levels, from dry to semi-sweet to sweet.

In the 1970s, plantings of Chenin blanc in the Loire were uprooted in favor of the more fashionable red Cabernet Franc and white Sauvignon blanc, as well as the easier-to-grow Gamay. This consolidated Chenin&#x27;s presence to the Middle Loire region around Anjou-Saumur and Touraine. In the 1980s, interest in the sweet dessert wines of the Loire renewed enthusiasm for Chenin blanc in the region. During this time, the Bordeaux wine region of Sauternes had experienced a series of favorable vintages that gave a dramatic increase in prices as supply began to dwindle in face of high demand. Wine consumers who had developed an appreciation for these sweet wines began to look to the Loire as another source. The 1990s brought a string of successful vintages to the Middle Loire that produced many highly rated Chenin wines affected by noble rot. As wine expert Oz Clarke noted, these wines became the &quot;standard-bearer&quot; for Chenin blanc.

The climate of the wine region tends to dictate what style of Chenin blanc is most prevalent in the area. In the northernmost reaches of Jasnières, Chenin blanc is at its limits for cultivation, with the wines being mostly dry and thin. While most of the Middle Loire experiences a continental climate, the Coteaux du Layon receives more climatic influence from the Atlantic Ocean, which promotes the development of &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, than in nearby Vouvray or Montlouis. While all three AOCs produce sweet, botrytized wine, less vintage variation is found in the Coteaux du Layon. The cool continental influence in Montlouis and Vouvray lends itself to producing a wide range of Chenin blanc, including grapes with the necessary balance of acidity to sugar needed to produce sparkling wine. In the AOC of Savennières, less fog and mist from the nearby rivers occur and more wind that makes botrytis taking root more difficult. This is part of the reason why Savennières is the one Loire AOC that produces predominantly dry Chenin blanc. In the south of France, the warm Mediterranean climate of the Languedoc region encourages the production of many more dry styles of Chenin blanc rather than sweet.

====Other wine styles and French Chenins====
While most Chenin blanc is produced as a varietal wine, up to 20% of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc are permitted in wines with the basic Anjou, Saumur, and Touraine designations. The high acidity of Chenin blanc lends itself well to sparkling-wine production, where it is an important component of Crémant de Loire, sparkling Vouvray, and in the Languedoc wine region of Limoux. In Crémant de Limoux, Chenin must account for at least 20% and up to 40% of the blend with Mauzac, Pinot noir and Chardonnay. The grape is also permitted in the still wines of Limoux, but is only blended with Mauzac and Chardonnay.

Outside the Loire, in addition to the Languedoc plantings in Limoux, other French plantings of Chenin blanc can be found in Corsica (with planted on the island in 2008), Charentes, and the Aveyron department. In South West France, it is permitted to be used in the white wines of the Côtes de Duras and the Garonne wines of Vins d&#x27;Estaing and Vins d&#x27;Entraygues et du Fel.

===South Africa===

In South Africa, Chenin blanc is the most widely planted variety, accounting for nearly one-fifth (18.6%) of all vineyard plantings in the early 21st century. In 2008, of the grape were planted, nearly twice the amount of Chenin blanc planted in France. Most of the plantings are found in the Western Cape wine region of Paarl in the Cape Winelands District Municipality, with with the Swartland region of Malmesbury and Olifants River not far behind with , respectively, in cultivation in 2008.

The variety was most likely introduced to the country in the collection of cuttings sent to Jan van Riebeeck by the Dutch East India Company. For the next two hundred years of South African wine history, the variety was known as Steen. Ampelographers were not able to concretely identify the numerous plantings of Steen around the country as being Chenin blanc until 1965. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chenin blanc was the principal grape in the South African wine industry&#x27;s &quot;white wine renaissance&quot; that was ushered in by the introduction of new technologies such as temperature-controlled fermentation vessels. During this time, the focus was on producing off-dry, clean, and crisp wine that was mostly neutral in flavor and could capitalize on the wine market&#x27;s demand for white wine. Near the end of the 20th century, several Chenin blanc specialist producers emerged and worked with vineyard managers to isolate older Chenin vines on suitable &quot;terroir&quot;. Their goal was to produce wines that exhibited Chenin&#x27;s unique aromas and traits. While plantings of Chenin blanc have decreased, the work of these producers resulted in improved quality profiles of South African Chenin blanc.

===United States===

During the 1980s, the California wine industry had more acreage of Chenin blanc planted than France, though the plantings later steadily declined. By 2006, were planted there, mostly in the hot Central Valley. In 2010, this level was down to .

For most of its history in the California wine industry, the grape was considered a &quot;workhorse variety&quot; that could be used anonymously in bulk and jug wine blends. Chenin&#x27;s natural acidity and ability to adapt to wines of varying degrees of sweetness made it an ideal blending partner with Colombard and Chardonnay in mass-produced blends. Until close to the turn 21st century, producers in Sacramento Valley&#x27;s Clarksburg AVA had not started to make quality varietal Chenin blancs a specialty; Chenin blancs from these producers tend to show a characteristic musky melon aroma and have the potential to age well.

While Chenin blanc is grown throughout the United States, the American Viticultural Areas with the most significant amount of plantings include the California AVAs of Clarksburg, Napa Valley, and Mendocino, the Washington wine regions of the Yakima and Columbia Valley, and the Texas High Plains AVA. In 2012, Washington had of Chenin while Texas was growing .

Other states in the United States with plantings of Chenin blanc include New York, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Arizona, New Mexico, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Idaho, Colorado and Texas. In 1990, of Chenin blanc were planted in Oregon, but by 2001, virtually all of it had been uprooted with only a few isolated plantings remaining.

===Other wine regions===
In Australia, the country&#x27;s of Chenin blanc are mostly grown as a blending variety often used with Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Semillon. Australian Chenin plantings can be found in Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, as well as the Swan Valley and Margaret River areas of Western Australia. Wine expert James Halliday describes the style of Australia Chenin blanc as &quot;tutti-frutti&quot; with pronounced fruit salad notes. However, the wines produced in Western Australia have garnered more critical attention. In 2008, there were of Chenin blanc in cultivation in Australia.

In New Zealand, acreage of the variety fell to just under by 2004. By 2008, that number had dropped to . Planted primarily on the North Island, some examples of New Zealand Chenin blanc have drawn favorable comparisons to the sweet dessert styles of Chenin from the Loire Valley. Historically, the grape has been used as a blending partner with Müller-Thurgau in mass-produced blends. The success of some critically acclaimed New Zealand Chenin blancs has sparked interest in planting the variety. As experts such as Oz Clarke have noted, though, as long as the value of New Zealand Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc stays high, little economic reason exists to pursue premium Chenin blanc production.

Chenin blanc is found planted throughout South America, though for many years plantings Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay were confused for Pinot blanc. The grape was used primarily in mass-produced white blends. In 2008, Argentina had of Chenin blanc, most of it in the Mendoza wine region, while Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay had , , and of grapevines planted, respectively.

The grape was exported to Israel in the 20th century, where it is still found in limited quantities. Canada has Chenin blanc planted in the Okanagan wine region of British Columbia and in Ontario. Some plantings of Chenin blanc can be found in the Spanish wine regions, mainly in Catalonia. In 2015, of the grape were planted, but this number may rise as DNA analysis in 2006 discovered the &quot;Agudelo&quot; grape variety growing in the Galicia, Alella, and Penedès wine region is actually Chenin blanc. The tropical wine regions of India and Thailand also has some limited plantings of the grape.

==Winemaking and wine styles==

Wine expert Jancis Robinson has noted that Chenin blanc is probably the world&#x27;s most versatile grape, being able to produce quality wines of various sweetness, including dessert wines noted for their aging ability, as well as sparkling made according to the &quot;méthode champenoise&quot; and fortified wines. The grape can distinguish itself as a single varietal wine, or it can add acidity as a blending component. Its ability to be crafted into premium-quality wines across a wide spectrum of dry and sweetness levels invites the comparison to German Rieslings, with Robinson noting that in many ways, Chenin blanc is France&#x27;s answer to the German Riesling.

One of the major differences between Old World- and New World-styles of Chenin blanc is the fermentation temperature. Old World-style producers in the Loire tend to ferment their Chenin blanc at higher temperatures, , than New World producers in South Africa and elsewhere, usually fermenting their whites at temperatures around . This is because Old World wine producers tend not to put a premium on the tropical fruit flavors and aromas that come out more vividly with cooler fermentation temperatures. Chenin blanc can accommodate some skin contact and maceration, which will allow extraction of phenolic compounds that could add to the complexity of the wine. Two of the aromas that skin contact can bring out is the characteristic greengage and angelica notes of Chenin. The grape&#x27;s characteristic acidity can be softened by malolactic fermentation, which gives the wine a creamier or &quot;fattier&quot; texture, as would a period spent aging on the lees. The use of wood or oak aging is up to each individual producer. Old World producers tend to shy away from the use of new oak barrels, which can impart flavors of vanilla, spice, and toasted notes, though these notes may be desirable for a New World producer. In Savennières, a tradition remains of using acacia and chestnut barrels for aging, though acacia can impart a yellow tint to the wine, and chestnut barrels may add some buttery notes.

==Wines==

The aromas and flavor notes of Chenin blanc often include the descriptors of minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from noble rot will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age. Dry or semisweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into more honey, acacia, and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, such as those of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin are more likely to be around 13.5%.

The aging ability of sweet Loire Chenin blanc is among the longest-lived in the world of wine, with well-made examples from favorable vintages regularly having the potential to last for at least 100 years. This longevity is attributed to the grape&#x27;s naturally high acidity, which acts as a preservative. As phenolic compounds in the wine break down, they add complexity and depth to the wine. Some off-dry or &quot;demi-sec&quot; examples may need at least 10 years before they start drinking at peak levels and could continue to develop for another 20 to 30 years. Sparkling and dry examples of Chenin blanc from premium production and favorable vintages have also shown longevity levels not commonly associated with white wine. However, as they age, Chenin blanc wines are prone to going through &quot;dumb phases&quot; where the wine closes up, revealing little aroma and varietal characteristics.

==Food pairings==
Chenin blanc can be a very versatile player in food and wine pairings, but the wide range of wine styles needs to be taken into account. Lighter, dry styles can pair well with light dishes such as salads, fish, and chicken. The sweeter styles of Chenin blanc can balance the spicy heat of some Asian and Hispanic cuisines. The acidity and balance of medium-dry styles can pair well with cream sauces and rich dishes such as &quot; pâté&quot;.

<text>An army group is a military organization consisting of several field armies, which is self-sufficient for indefinite periods. It is usually responsible for a particular geographic area. An army group is the largest field organization handled by a single commander – usually a full general or field marshal – and it generally includes between 400,000 and 1,000,000 soldiers.

In the Polish Armed Forces and former Soviet Red Army an army group was known as a Front. The equivalent of an army group in the Imperial Japanese Army was a &quot;general army&quot; ().

Army groups may be multi-national formations. For example, during World War II, the Southern Group of Armies (also known as the U.S. 6th Army Group) comprised the U.S. Seventh Army and the French First Army; the 21st Army Group comprised the British Second Army, the Canadian First Army and the US Ninth Army.

In both Commonwealth and U.S. usage, the number of an army group is expressed in Arabic numerals (e.g., &quot;12th Army Group&quot;), while the number of a field army is spelled out (e.g., &quot;Third Army&quot;).

==World War I==

===France===
The French Army formed a number of during the First World War. 
* Army Group North, formed on a provisional basis in October 1914. 
* Army Group East, created in 1915
* Army Group Centre, created in 1915
* Army Group Reserve was established in 1917. 
* Army Group Flanders, created in September 1918 under the command of Albert I of Belgium, to conduct the Second Battle of Belgium as part of the Hundred Days Offensive.

===Germany===
The German Army formed its first two &quot;Heeresgruppen&quot; in 1915, to control forces on the eastern front. A total of eight army groups would ultimately be raised – four for service on each front, with one of the eastern front army groups being a multinational German and Austro-Hungarian formation. Originally the Imperial German army groups were not separate formations, but instead additional responsibilities granted to certain army commanders. Crown Prince Wilhelm for instance, was simultaneously commander of the 5th Army and Army Group German Crown Prince from August 1915 to November 1916.

All eight German army groups were named after their commanders.

* Army Group Mackensen (Poland) (22 Apr 1915 - 8 Sep 1915)
** Army Group Linsingen (8 Sep 1915 - 31 Mar 1918)
** Army Group Eichhorn-Kiev (31 Mar 1918 - 30 Apr 1918)
** Army Group Eichhorn (30 Apr 1918 - 31 Jul 1918)
** Army Group Kiev (31 Jul 1918 - 3 Feb 1919)
* Army Group Mackensen (Serbia) (18 Sep 1915 - 30 July 1916)
** Army Group Below (11 Oct 1916 - 21 Apr 1917)
** Army Group Scholtz (23 Apr 1917 - 6 Oct 1918) 
* Army Group Mackensen (Romania) (28 Aug 1916 - 7 May 1918)
* Army Group Prince Leopold of Bavaria (5 Aug 1915 - 29 Aug 1916) 
** Army Group Woyrsch (29 Aug 1916 - 15 Dec 1917)
* Army Group Gallwitz (1916) (19 Jul 1916 - 28 Aug 1916) 
** Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria (&quot;A&quot;) (28 Aug 1916 - 11 Nov 1918)
* Army Group German Crown Prince (&quot;B&quot;) (1 Aug 1915 - 11 Nov 1918)
* Army Group Gallwitz (1918) (&quot;C&quot;) (1 Feb 1918 - 11 Nov 1918) 
*Army Group Duke Albrecht of Württemberg (&quot;D&quot;) (7 Mar 1917 - 11 Nov 1918)
* Army Group Hindenburg (5 Aug 1915 - 30 Jul 1916)
** Army Group Eichhorn (30 Jul 1916 - 31 Mar 1918)
** Army Group Riga (31 Mar 1918 - 30 Apr 1918)
* Army Group Boehn (12 Aug 1918 - 8 Oct 1918 )
===Ottoman Empire===
The Ottoman Army had three army groups:
*Caucasus Army Group (8 Mar 1917 - 16 Dec 1917)
* Yildirim Army Group (&quot;F&quot;): also contained the German Asia Corps (July 1917 - 7 Nov 1918)
*Eastern Army Group (7 Jun 1918 - 21 October 1918)

==World War II==

===China===
:
A Chinese &quot;army group&quot; was usually equivalent in numbers only to a field army in the terminology of other countries, as the regimental level was sometimes omitted.

===Germany===
:See Heeresgruppen and Armeegruppen
The German Army was organized into army groups (&quot;Heeresgruppen&quot;). Some of these army groups included armies from several Axis countries. For example, Army Group Africa contained both German and Italian corps.

A separate and distinct German military unit (&quot;:de:Armeegruppe&quot;), which is also translated to English as &quot;army group&quot;, describes more temporary groupings of army-sized units, where the command of one of its composite units formed the grouping&#x27;s command structure. These groupings were usually named after the commander of the unit in question, for example Armeegruppe Weichs, part of Army Group B during Operation Blau in 1942.

===Japan===

During World War II there were six general armies:

*&quot;Kantōgun&quot; (often known as the &quot;Kwantung Army&quot;) originated as the division-level garrison of a Japanese colony in northeast China, in 1908; it remained in northern China until the end of World War II. The strength of the &quot;Kantōgun&quot; peaked at 700,000 personnel in 1941. It faced and was destroyed by Soviet forces in 1945.
*&quot;Shina Hakengun&quot;, the &quot;China Expeditionary Army&quot;, was formed in Nanjing, in September 1939, to control operations in central China. At the end of World War II, it consisted of 620,000 personnel in 25 infantry and one armored divisions.
*&quot;Nanpo Gun&quot; was the &quot;Southern Army&quot;, also known as the &quot;Southern Expeditionary Army&quot;. By November 1941, war with the western Allies appeared likely and &quot;Nanpo Gun&quot; was formed in Saigon, French Indochina, to control Imperial Japanese Army operations in southern China, South Asia, South East Asia, and the South Pacific.

In April 1945, the &quot;Boei So-Shireibu&quot; (translated as &quot;general defense command&quot; or &quot;home defense general headquarters&quot; and similar names) was split into three general armies:
*&quot;Dai-Ichi So-Gun&quot; (&quot;1st General Army&quot;, headquartered in Tokyo)
*&quot;Dai-Ni So-Gun&quot; (&quot;2nd General Army&quot;, headquartered in Hiroshima)
*&quot;Koku So-Gun&quot; (&quot;Air General Army&quot;, headquartered in Tokyo)

By August 1945, these comprised two million personnel in 55 divisions and numerous smaller independent units. After the surrender of Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army was dissolved, except for the &quot;Dai-Ichi So-Gun&quot;, which existed until 30 November 1945 as the 1st Demobilization Headquarters.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Army was organized into fronts (&quot;фронт&quot;, pl. &quot;фронты&quot;) which were often as large as an army group. (See List of Soviet fronts in World War II.) Some of the fronts contained Allied formations raised in exile. For example, the Polish First Army was part of the 1st Belorussian Front.

===Western Allies===
The Western Allies established six separate army groups during the Second World War, although no more than five existed simultaneously. The army groups were subordinate to the Allied theatre supreme commanders. Led by British and American officers, they included troops from numerous allied nations; the British–American 15th Army Group also included Canadian and Polish corps, divisions from Brazil, India, New Zealand and South Africa and a Greek brigade. As part of Operation Quicksilver, the Allies set up a seventh, fictitious First United States Army Group.

;Mediterranean/European Theater
* 18th Army Group: Established on 20 February 1943, under the command of General Harold Alexander for the Tunisia Campaign. A primarily British formation, it comprised the British First Army and Eighth Army, but included French and American corps. After the capture of Tunisia in May 1943 it was reorganized as the 15th Army Group.
* 15th Army Group: Established on 15 May 1943, under the command of General Harold Alexander for the Allied invasion of Italy. For the invasion of Sicily it consisted of the British Eighth Army and U.S. Seventh Army. Subsequently, the Seventh Army was replaced by the U.S. Fifth Army and Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark succeeded Alexander in December 1944.
* 21st Army Group: Established in June 1943 under the command of General Bernard Paget. In January 1944 Paget was replaced by General Bernard Montgomery who led the army group throughout Operation Overlord and the subsequent North West Europe Campaign. 21st Army Group was made up of the First Canadian Army and the British Second Army, but also had command of the First Allied Airborne Army, U.S. First Army and U.S. Ninth Army for some operations. After the breakout from Normandy, it formed the northern wing of the Allied Expeditionary Force and was sometimes referred to as the Northern Army Group.
* 12th Army Group: Established on 14 July 1944, the 12th Army Group was officially activated at noon on 1 August 1944, under the command of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, with Lieutenant Generals Courtney Hodges and George Patton commanding First Army and Third Army, respectively. Eventually, 12th Army Group included Ninth Army under the command of Lieutenant General William Simpson and Fifteenth Army under the command of Lieutenant General &quot;Gee&quot; Gerow, it was the largest of the Western Allies&#x27; army groups in World War II. 12th Army Group occupied the middle of the Allied line, between the 21st and 6th Army Groups, and was sometimes referred to as the Central Army Group. This was the only army group in World War II that consisted entirely of U.S. troops. At its peak at end of the war, 12th Army Group consisted of the four aforementioned field armies, twelve corps, and over forty divisions – four-star General Bradley commanded over 1.3 million men in his army group, the largest number of American soldiers ever commanded by a single officer in the history of the United States Army.
* 6th Army Group: Established on 29 July 1944 under the command of Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers for Operation Dragoon. Made up of the U.S. Seventh Army and the French First Army, it occupied the southern flank of the Allied Expeditionary Force in western Europe and was sometimes referred to as the Southern Army Group.

;China Burma India Theater
* 11th Army Group: Established in November 1943 under the command of General George Giffard for the Burma Campaign. The 11th Army Group originally comprised the British Fourteenth Army and Ceylon Army, with a degree of control over the Sino-American Northern Combat Area Command. In November 1944 Giffard was succeeded by Lieutenant General Oliver Leese and firm command established over the Northern Combat Area Command. General William Slim replaced Leese in July 1945, shortly before the war ended in August 1945.

==NATO army groups==
During the Cold War, NATO land forces in what was designated the Central Region (most of the Federal Republic of Germany) would have been commanded in wartime by two army groups. Under Allied Forces Central Europe and alongside air force elements, the two army groups would have been responsible for the defence of Germany against any Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion. These two principal subordinate commanders had only limited peacetime authorities, and issues such as training, doctrine, logistics, and rules of engagement were largely a national, rather than NATO, responsibility.

The two formations were the Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) and the Central Army Group (CENTAG). By World War II and previous standards, these two formations were only armies, as they contained four corps each. NORTHAG consisted, from north to south, of I (Netherlands) Corps (I (NE) Corps), I German Corps (I (GE) Corps), I (BR) Corps, and I Belgian Corps (I (BE) Corps). Its commander was the British commander of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). CENTAG consisted, from north to south, of III (GE) Corps, V US Corps, VII (US) Corps, and II (GE) Corps in the extreme south of the Federal Republic of Germany. The commander of the U.S. Seventh Army commanded CENTAG.

In November 1991, the NATO heads of state and government adopted the &quot;New Strategic Concept&quot; at the NATO Summit in Rome. This new conceptual orientation led, among other things, to fundamental changes both in the force and integrated command structure. Structural changes began in June 1993, when HQ Central Army Group (CENTAG) at Heidelberg and Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) at Mönchengladbach were deactivated and replaced by Headquarters Allied Land Forces Central Europe (LANDCENT), which was activated at Heidelberg on 1 July 1993.

<text>Colombard (also known as French Colombard in North America) is a white French wine grape variety that may be the offspring of Chenin blanc and Gouais blanc. This makes the grape the sibling of the Armagnac Meslier-Saint-François and the nearly extinct Cognac grape Balzac blanc.

In France, it was traditionally grown in the Charentes and Gascony for distilling into Cognac and Armagnac respectively. Today it is still among the permitted white grape varieties in Bordeaux wine, and in Gascony for Vins de Pays Côtes de Gascogne and the white Floc de Gascogne. aperitif drink. The wine is known for its distinctive flavours of Guava.

Old vine grapes are crushed by some northern Californian producers and made into a fruity white wine of interesting character in both dry and sweet versions. This grape is mainly grown in California to provide backbone, due to its natural acidic character, for white &quot;jug wine&quot; blends. Additionally, it is widely grown in South Africa, where it is known as Colombar, and to a lesser extent in Australia and Israel.

==Synonyms==
Colombard is also known under the synonyms Bardero, Blanc Emery, Blanquette, Bon blanc, Chabrier vert, Charbrier vert, Colombar, Colombard bijeli, Colombeau, Colombie, Colombier, Coulombier, Cubzadais, Donne rousse, Donne verte, French Colombard, Gros Blanc Doux, Gros Blanc Roux, Guenille, Kolombar, Martin Cot, Pied Tendre, Quene Tendre, Quene vert, Queue Tendre, Queue verte, and West&#x27;s White Prolific.

<text>Corvina is an Italian wine grape variety that is sometimes also referred to as Corvina Veronese or Cruina. The total global wine-growing area in 2010 was , all of which is grown in the Veneto region of northeast Italy, except for planted in Argentina. Corvina is used with several other grapes to create the light red regional wines Bardolino and Valpolicella that have a mild fruity flavor with hints of almond. These blends include Corvinone, Rondinella, and Molinara, and Rossignola for the latter wine. It is also used for the production of Amarone and Recioto.

==Wines==
Corvina produces light to medium body wines with a light crimson coloring. The grapes&#x27; naturally high acidity can make the wine somewhat tart with a slight, bitter almond note. The finish is sometimes marked with sour-cherry notes. In some regions of Valpolicella, producers are using barrel aging to add more structure and complexity to the wine. The small berries of Corvina are low in tannins and color extract but have thick skins that are ideal for drying and protecting the grape from rot.

==Viticulture==
The Corvina vine ripens late and is prone to producing high yields which can harm wine quality. During the growth cycle of the grape vine, the first few buds do not produce fruit. The vines need to be trained along a pergola which allows for a long cane that can produce more buds.

==Relationship to other grapes==
Historically in the Veneto region Corvina was often confused with Corvinone, a similar larger red grape that ripens later, but DNA profiling has shown that they are two distinct varieties. In 2005, DNA evidence showed that Corvina was a parent variety to the Venetian grape Rondinella.

<doc id="555057" wikidata="Q3682195" url="?curid=555057" title="Slave codes">
<text>The slave codes were laws relating to slavery and enslaved people, specifically regarding the Atlantic slave trade and chattel slavery in the Americas.

Most slave codes were concerned with the rights and duties of free people in regards to enslaved people. Slave codes left a great deal unsaid, with much of the actual practice of slavery being a matter of traditions rather than formal law.

The primary colonial powers all had slightly different slave codes. French colonies, after 1685, had the Code Noir specifically for this purpose. The Spanish had some laws regarding slavery in Las Siete Partidas, a far older law that was not designed for the slave societies of the Americas. English colonies largely had their own local slave codes, mostly based on the codes of either the colonies of Barbados or Virginia.

In addition to these national and state- or colony-level slave codes, there were city ordinances and other local restrictions regarding enslaved people.

==Typical slave codes==
There are many similarities between the various slave codes. The most common elements are:

*Movement restrictions: Most regions required any slaves away from their plantations or outside of the cities they resided in to have a pass signed by their master. Many cities in the slave-states required slave tags, small copper badges that enslaved people wore, to show that they were allowed to move about.
*Marriage restrictions: Most places restricted the marriage rights of enslaved people, ostensibly to prevent them from trying to change masters by marrying into a family on another plantation. Marriage between people of different races was also usually restricted.
*Prohibitions on gathering: Slave codes generally prevented large groups of enslaved people from gathering away from their plantations.
*Slave patrols: In the slave-dependent portions of North America, varying degrees of legal authority backed slave patrols by plantation owners and other free whites to ensure that enslaved people were not free to move about at night, and to generally enforce the restrictions on slaves.
*Trade and commerce by slaves: Initially, most places gave enslaved people some land to work personally and allowed them to operate their markets. As slavery became more profitable, slave codes restricting the rights of enslaved people to buy, sell, and produce goods were introduced. In some places, slave tags were required to be worn by enslaved people to prove that they were allowed to participate in certain types of work.
*Punishment and killing of slaves: Slave codes regulated how slaves could be punished, usually going so far as to apply no penalty for accidentally killing a slave while punishing them. Later laws began to apply restrictions on this, but slave-owners were still rarely punished for killing their slaves. Historian Lawrence M. Friedman wrote: &quot;Ten Southern codes made it a crime to mistreat a slave... Under the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825 (art. 192), if a master was ′convicted of cruel treatment,′ the judge could order the sale of the mistreated slave, presumably to a better master.&quot;
*Education restrictions: Some codes made it illegal to teach slaves to read. Slave literacy

==England&#x27;s American colonies and the United States==
There was no central English slave code; each colony developed its own code, often with reference to Roman law and its treatment of the status of slaves.
After the United States established independence in the American Revolutionary War of 1775–1783, the individual states ratified new constitutions, but their laws were generally a continuation of the laws those regions had maintained prior to that point, and their slave codes remained unchanged.

The first comprehensive slave-code in an English colony was established in Barbados, an island in the Caribbean, in 1661. Many other slave codes of the time are based directly on this model. Modifications of the Barbadian slave codes were put in place in the Colony of Jamaica in 1664, and were then greatly modified in 1684. The Jamaican codes of 1684 were copied by the colony of South Carolina, first in 1691, and then immediately following the Stono Rebellion, in 1740. The South Carolina slave-code served as the model for many other colonies in North America. In 1755, the colony of Georgia adopted the South Carolina slave code.

Virginia&#x27;s slave codes were made in parallel to those in Barbados, with individual laws starting in 1667 and a comprehensive slave-code passed in 1705. In 1667, the Virginia House of Burgesses enacted a law which did not recognize the conversion of African Americans to Christianity despite a baptism. In 1669, Virginia enacted &quot;An act about the casual killing of slaves&quot; which declared that masters who killed slaves deemed resisting were exempt from felony charges. In 1670, they enacted a law prohibiting free Africans from purchasing servants who weren&#x27;t also African. In 1680, Virginia passed Act X, which prohibited slaves from carrying weapons, leaving their owner&#x27;s plantation without a certificate, or raising a hand against &quot;Christians&quot;.

The slave codes of the other tobacco colonies (Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina) were modeled on the Virginia code. While not based directly on the codes of Barbados, the Virginia codes were inspired by them. The shipping and trade that took place between the West Indies and the Chesapeake (the &quot;final passage&quot; of the Triangular Trade) meant that planters quickly became aware of any legal and cultural changes that took place. According to historian Russell Menard, when Maryland put its slave code in place in the 1660s the Barbadian codes functioned as a &quot;legal cultural hearth&quot; for the law, with members of the Maryland legislature having been former residents of Barbados.

The northern colonies developed their own slave-codes at later dates, with the strictest evolving in the colony of New York, which passed a comprehensive slave code in 1702 and expanded that code in 1712 and 1730.

The British Slave Trade Act 1807 abolished the slave trade throughout the British Empire. In 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act ended slavery throughout the British Empire.

The United States experienced divisions between slave states in the South and free states in the North. At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, there were 34 states in the United States, 15 of which were slave states, all of which had slave codes. The 19 free states did not have slave codes, although they still had laws regarding slavery and enslaved people, covering such issues as how to handle slaves from slave states, whether they were runaways or with their owners.

Slavery was not banned nationwide in the United States until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified by 27 states by December 6, 1865. The 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, in effect on 1 January 1808, had made it a felony to import slaves from abroad.

==French slave codes==
The French colonies in North America were the only portion of the Americas to have an effective slave code applied from the center of the empire. King Louis XIV applied the Code Noir in 1685, and it was adopted by Saint-Domingue in 1687 and the French West Indies in 1687, French Guiana in 1704, Réunion in 1723, and Louisiana in 1724. It was never applied in Canada, which had very few slaves. The Code Noir was developed in part to combat the spread of Protestantism and thus focuses more on religious restrictions than other slave codes. The Code Noir was significantly updated in 1724.

The city of New Orleans in Louisiana developed slave codes under Spain, France, and the United States, due to Louisiana changing hands several times, resulting in a very complex set of slave codes. The needs of the locals were usually held in favor over any outside laws.

France abolished slavery after the French Revolution, first by freeing second-generation slaves in 1794. Although it was reinstated under Napoleon with the Law of 20 May 1802

==Spanish slave codes==
In practice, the slave codes of the Spanish colonies were local laws, similar to those in other regions. There was an overarching legal code, Las Siete Partidas, which granted many specific rights to the slaves in these regions, but there is little record of it actually being used to benefit the slaves in the Americas. Las Siete Partidas was compiled in the thirteenth century, long before the colonization of the new world, and its treatment of slavery was based on the Roman tradition. Frank Tannenbaum, an influential sociologist who wrote on the treatment of slaves in the Americas, treated the laws in Las Siete Partidas as an accurate reflection of treatment, but later scholarship has moved away from this viewpoint, arguing that the official laws in Las Siete Partidas did not reflect practices in the colonies.

An attempt to unify the Spanish slave codes, the Codigo Negro, was cancelled without ever going into effect because it was unpopular with the slave-owners in the Americas.

The Laws of the Indies were an ongoing body of laws, modified throughout the history of the Spanish colonies, that incorporated many slave laws in the later versions.

<doc id="555060" wikidata="Q174237" url="?curid=555060" title="Budva">
<text>Budva (Cyrillic: Будва, or ) is a town in the Coastal region of Montenegro. It had 27,445 inhabitants as of 2023, and is the centre of Budva Municipality. The coastal area around Budva, called the Budva Riviera, is the center of Montenegrin tourism, known for its well-preserved medieval walled city, sandy beaches and diverse nightlife. Budva is 2,500 years old, which makes it one of the oldest settlements on the Adriatic coast.

== Etymology ==
In Serbo-Croatian, the town is known as Будва or &quot;Budva&quot;; in Italian and Latin as &quot;Budua&quot;; in Albanian as &quot;Budua&quot;, and in (classical/ancient) Greek as &quot;Bouthoe&quot; (Βουθόη) and &quot;Butua&quot; (Βουτούα).

==History==
A legend recounts that Bouthoe (Βουθόη - &quot;Bouthoē&quot;) was founded by Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, Greece, when exiled out of Thebes, finding a shelter in this place for him and his wife, goddess Harmonia.

The first record of Budva dates back to the 5th century BC. Originally, the site belonged to the state of Illyria. In the 6th century BC, during the Greek colonization of the Adriatic, a Greek emporium was established. In the 2nd century BC, the area of Budva became part of the Roman Republic and from 27 BC, of the Roman Empire. Upon the fall of the Empire and its division into east and west, the defensive barrier which separated the two powers happened to run across this area, subsequently making a lasting impact on the history and culture of this town.

In the 6th century, Budva was part of the Byzantine Empire, and in the following two centuries, Slavs and, to a lesser extent, Avars began to arrive in the area, mixing with the native Roman population. Budva bay was reportedly known as &quot;Avarorum sinus&quot; (Avar bay&#x27;) during the Avar incursions. In 841, Budva was sacked by Muslim Saracens, who devastated the area.

In the early Middle Ages, Budva was reigned by a succession of Doclean kings, as well as Serbian and Zetan aristocrats.

, it became the see of a Roman Catholic Diocese of Budua, which lasted until 1828 and was nominally revived as a Latin titular bishopric.
It was controlled by the Balšić family for some decades and shortly controlled by the Albanian Zaharia family in the 14th century. The Venetians ruled the town for nearly 400 years, from 1420 to 1797. Budva, called &quot;Budua&quot; in those centuries, was part of the of Albania Veneta and was fortified by powerful Venetian walls against Ottoman conquests. According to the historian Luigi Paulucci in his book &quot;Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810&quot; (The Bay of Kotor in 1810), most of the population spoke the Venetian language until the beginning of the 19th century. One of the most renowned theater librettists and composers, Cristoforo Ivanovich, was born in Venetian Budua. Nevertheless, Budva was briefly under Ottoman rule between 1572 and 1573 due to conquest by Occhiali. It was returned to Venetians under conditions of Treaty of Constantinople (1573). In 1675 a French Archaeologist,Jacob Spon visited Budva and stated that Budva is like a border between Albanians and Venetians.

With the fall of Republic of Venice in 1797, Budva came under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy. During the Napoleonic Wars, Montenegrin forces allied with Russia took control over the city in 1806, only to relinquish the city to France in 1807. French rule lasted until 1813, when Budva (along with Boka Kotorska) was ceded to the Austrian Empire, which remained in control of the city for the next 100 years.

A union of Boka Kotorska (and Budva) with Montenegro took place for a brief period (1813–1814), but from 1814 until the end of World War I in 1918, Budva remained under Austria-Hungary. The southernmost fortress in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Fort Kosmač, was constructed nearby to guard the road from Budva to Cetinje. After the war, the Serbian army entered Budva after it was abandoned by Austrian forces and it came under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

In 1941, with the beginning of World War II, Budva was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy. Budva was finally liberated from Axis rule on 22 November 1944 and incorporated in the Socialist Republic of Montenegro (which was a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).

A catastrophic earthquake struck Budva on 15 April 1979. Much of old town was devastated, but today there is little evidence of the catastrophe – almost all the buildings were restored to their original form.

Montenegro became an independent country in 2006, with Budva as its primary tourist destination.

In 2022, the city became the center of Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish immigrants in Montenegro after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a sharp population increase.

== Cityscape ==

=== Old Town ===


The Old Town of Budva is situated on a rocky peninsula, on the southern end of Budva field. Archaeological evidence suggests that Illyrian settlement was formed on the site of the Old Town before Greek colonization of the Adriatic. While the site was permanently settled since Roman era, most of existing city walls and buildings were erected during the Venetian rule.

The entire town is encircled with defensive stone walls. The fortifications of Budva are typical of the Medieval walled cities of the Adriatic, complete with towers, embrasures, fortified city gates and a citadel.

Originally, there were gates on all of the four sides of the walled city. However, sea-facing gates were closed up over the years. The main city gate is Porta di Terra Ferma, the grand entry to the city from the west. It is also the beginning of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare, Njegoševa Street. There are also four more gates on the north wall, facing Budva marina (Porta Pizana, Porta Pizana 1 and 2, and Porta Pizanella), and one small gate facing the southwestern beach of Ričardova glava.

The layout of the town is roughly orthogonal, although many streets deviate from the grid, resulting in somewhat irregular pattern, with many piazzas connected with narrow streets. Today, the entire city within the walls is pedestrian-only.

The town citadel is situated on the southern tip of the city. Originally known as Castle of St Mary, fortification was continually rebuilt and expanded through Middle Ages, reaching its final form during the Austro-Hungarian rule. The sea-facing 160m long ramparts of the citadel, complete with eastern and western towers, are intricately connected to the rest of the city walls. Austrian stone barracks form the most prominent structure within the castle, separating the citadel from the rest of the walled city. Ruins of the Santa Maria de Castello church, after which the entire complex was originally named, are located within the citadel.

A large public square is located to the north of the citadel, containing all of the churches of the old town - St. Ivan Church (17th century), Santa Maria in Punta Church (840 AD), St Sava Orthodox Church (12th century), and The Holy Trinity Orthodox church (1804).
The Old Town suffered extensive damage in 1979 earthquake; repair and reconstruction took eight years (until 1987), but traces of the damage are now hardly noticeable. Today, it is a prime visitor attraction of Budva, packed with tourists during the summer months. Its narrow cobbled streets are lined with restaurants, cafes, pubs and shops.

=== Outside the Old Town ===


Although confined to the walls of the Old Town for most of its history, Budva started significant expansion into the adjacent &quot;Budva field&quot; in the 20th century, with the development of tourism industry. Hotels started springing up near the Old Town and to the west of it, along the 1600m long Slovenska beach, including the landmark Avala hotel (built in 1939), the Mogren hotel, and the Slovenska plaža hotel complex (built in 1984). Development near the Old Town and along the longest city beach was done in a planned and sustainable manner, with parts of Budva built in the SFRY having all the characteristics of a well-organized resort town. Most of the hotels and facilities built during this period are situated to the south of the town&#x27;s main traffic artery, a portion of Adriatic Highway (E65/E80) that crosses the city parallel to the Slovenska plaža beach.

However, the rest of the Budva field, to the north of the Adriatic Highway, developed in a less uniform manner. The western part of Budva field, containing a civic center (an area featuring local government offices, schools, sports center, police and fire station, health center and bus station), Rozino, Dubovica and Golubovina neighbourhoods, was developed relatively in accordance with principles of urban planning.

In contrast, the eastern part of the Budva field, and slopes of the hills surrounding it, saw the emergence of the chaotic urban sprawl. Spontaneous growth begun in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as a combination of high demand and inability of the state to enforce urban planning, as the Breakup of Yugoslavia took place. This trend continued into the 2000s, with prices of real estate skyrocketing following Montenegrin independence. Overwhelming demand, fueled by the influx of foreign capital (in large part from Russia), meant that all the undeveloped lots in the Budva field and surrounding hills were quickly being turned into construction sites. Local and state authorities have failed to keep up with the developers, resulting in the unfortunate lack of urban planning in much of the area. Thus, large parts of Budva are connected with an irregular grid of narrow streets, and have overall inadequate infrastructure. This trend continues even today, with limited land forcing developers to turn to building towering high rises in place of small detached residences that made up for majority of Budva field in the early 1990s.
The pressures of the real estate market and neglect of urban planning have resulted in chronic and severe lack of parking space, and frequent traffic jams during the summer. Even the water and electricity supply have failed to keep up with the explosive growth in the 2000s, but those issues have since been addressed.

A testament to the urban sprawl, the city bypass (Obilaznica, a crescent road that circles the northern ends of Budva field, with ends connecting to the Adriatic Highway) is a bypass only in name, as it now a busy urban street, swallowed by the city&#x27;s expanding urban area.

The term &quot;Budvanizacija&quot; (&quot;Budvanization&quot;) has been used regionally to denote a form of chaotic and massive urban growth, tailored to the needs of individual land owners and developers, without regard for sustainability or environment.

== Tourism ==
Tourism is the main driver of the economy of Budva. It is a significant tourist destination on the eastern Adriatic, and by far the most popular destination in Montenegro. During 2013, Budva recorded 668,931 tourist visits, and 4,468,913 overnight stays, thus accounting for 44,8% of tourist visits to Montenegro, and 47,5% of its overnight stays.

Although Budva is notable for its long history and its well-preserved Old Town, it is not primarily known as a destination for sightseeing or cultural tourism. Unlike Kotor or Dubrovnik, Budva has an image of a crowded beach resort, with a lively and vibrant atmosphere and a very active nightlife.

=== Beaches ===

Mogren Beach is arguably the best known and most attractive of the Budva city beaches, nested beneath the cliffs of the Spas hill, between cape Mogren and the Avala hotel. The beach stretches over and is divided into two distinct areas, Mogren 1 and Mogren 2. The beach is separated from Budva by the Spas hill and is accessible from the old town by a concrete path running along the cliffs. The remains of Mogren Fortress are accessible from hiking trails from Mogren 2.

Other city beaches include the small Ričardova Glava Beach (&quot;Richard&#x27;s Head&quot;) and Pizana Beach, next to the Old Town, as well as the long Slovenska plaža (Slav beach), that makes up most of the city&#x27;s coast.

However, majority of the beaches of Budva Riviera are outside the city itself. Jaz Beach is a long and spacious beach west of Budva, its hinterland serving as a popular concert and festival venue, as well as a campground. Bečići resort town, with its long sandy beach, is situated south-east of the city, separated from Budva by the Zavala peninsula.

Further to the south, numerous small beaches and towns, make up the more high end and exclusive part of Budva Riviera. This is especially true for the famous Sveti Stefan town, but also for other smaller Paštrovići settlements in the area, that once were unassuming fishing villages. The area of Sveti Stefan and Pržno, including Miločer resort with its park and secluded beaches, is considered the most exclusive area of the Montenegrin coast.

The town of Petrovac and the undeveloped Buljarica field occupy the very south of the Budva municipality.

Sveti Nikola Island is located opposite of Old Town, across the Budva bay. Connected to the mainland via water bus, the island and its beaches are an excursion site for tourists visiting Budva.

===Nightlife===

Budva is well known regionally as the capital of nightlife of the eastern Adriatic. The first discothèques in Budva started to emerge during the 1980s, as hotel-attached dance clubs. However, the clubbing scene mushroomed in the 1990s, with numerous open-air clubs opening along the Budva sea promenade. This trend continued into the 2000s, with Old Town and its promenade hosting a large number of bars, pubs and restaurants, and two big clubs, Top Hill and Trocadero, dominating the clubbing scene.

===Other===
Budva is home to the Adriatic Fair (Jadranski sajam), the only specialized exhibition venue in Montenegro. It hosts numerous trade fairs throughout the year, including the only auto show in Montenegro, held annually in autumn.

Gambling tourism is also popular in Budva, as many hotels have attached casinos. Maestral hotel and casino in Pržno are particularly popular among international gamblers, but other large hotels have also attracted players from European countries. The 2006 James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; is partly set in the eponymous casino in the fictional Montenegrin Hotel Splendide, thus giving a boost to Budva&#x27;s profile as a gambling destination.

Budva&#x27;s marina, nestled to the north of the Old Town city walls, contributes to the image of Budva as a nautical tourism destination. Luxury yachts dominate marina berths during the summer, overshadowing small fishing vessels owned by the locals. Budva marina was host to periodic boat shows, but in recent years it has been losing primacy to the larger and more luxurious Porto Montenegro. Budva was the host of the Class 1 World Powerboat Championship Grand prix in May 2008.

== Culture ==

Among the cultural events and establishments in the city, the annual cultural event &quot;Theatre City&quot; (Budva Grad Teatar) is of particular importance. Founded in 1987, and held in July and August every year, this festival transforms the entire Old Town into an open-air venue for a programme of theatre, musical, literary and visual art events and performances.

Another event in Budva was the Pjesma Mediterana (&quot;Song of the Mediterranean&quot;), annual pop musical festival, held in Budva from 1992 to 2010. Its format was similar to that of Sanremo Music Festival, featuring a competition of previously unreleased songs. The song contest attracted performers from the EX Yugoslavia region. However, the festival was cancelled in 2011 due to lack of funds, and has not been renewed since.

In 2014, the Sea Dance Festival was organized at Budva&#x27;s Jaz Beach for the first time. A spin-off of the Exit festival, Sea Dance is set to be an annual event. Jaz Beach rose to prominence as a concert and festival venue with The Rolling Stones concert held on 9 July 2007. The show was part of their A Bigger Bang Tour and attracted a crowd of some 35,000 spectators, twice the population of Budva town itself. Madonna staged a show attended by 47,000 spectators at the same venue on 25 September 2008, while Lenny Kravitz and Armand Van Helden performed at Jaz beach during the &quot;Live Fest&quot; in August 2008, along with Goran Bregović, Dino Merlin and Zdravko Čolić.

Budva Carnival is a three-day long festive event in Budva, happening annually during late April or early May. It has been organized every year since 2003, and although a recent carnival, it has attracted significant regional attention. Budva, together with nearby Kotor, was host to the Federation of European Carnival Cities (FECC) World Carnival City Congress in May 2009.

Budva city museum is one of the prominent cultural institutions in the city, featuring permanent archaeological and ethnographic exhibits. Stefan Mitrov Ljubiša memorial home is another significant institution, honoring the legacy of the famous native of Budva.

Budva occupies a significant place in the history of the cinema of Montenegro, as it was home to the Zeta Film, the Montenegrin primary motion picture company from the Yugoslav era. The now-defunct company has produced numerous Yugoslav movies, including pictures by the Montenegrin director Živko Nikolić. Zeta Film was privatized in 2004, and its building was converted to a nightclub, leaving Budva without a single movie theater for a decade. On 30 May 2015, a brand new four screen multiplex cinema opened in TQ Plaza shopping mall.

The city has occasionally provided the backdrop for international movie productions. The 1964 movie &quot;The Long Ships&quot; was shot in and around Budva, and the prop from the movie, a large 4m tall cracked bell, has been permanently displayed in front of the Old Town walls, becoming one of the local landmarks. Recently, Budva has been the setting and the filming location of the locally produced, and regionally popular TV series &quot;Budva na pjenu od mora&quot; (&quot;Budva, on the sea foam&quot;).

=== Education ===
Budva has two elementary schools and one high school. In 2009, city administration founded Knowledge Academy (Akademija Znanja), an institution envisioned to act as a university center and introduce higher education to Budva. The Knowledge Academy building, situated in the Rozino neighbourhood of Budva, is currently home to Budva city library and private Business and Tourism faculty, and serves as the center of higher education of the municipality.

=== Sports ===
FK Mogren was the most popular football club in Budva, and the sports club with longest tradition in the city. Founded in 1920, it competed in the Montenegrin First League, winning the championship in 2008–09 and 2010–11. The club also won the Montenegrin Cup of 2008. The club went bankrupt and was expelled in 2017. Stadion Lugovi, the home ground of FK Mogren, will probably be relocated in the near future, as it is situated on a very valuable land lot, right next to the Slovenska beach.

OFK Petrovac, from the eponymous town, is another significant football team from the Budva municipality.

Another popular sport in Budva is volleyball, with Budvanska Rivijera volleyball team being successful in domestic and international competition. Mediteranski sportski centar (&quot;Mediterranean sports center&quot;) is the main indoor sport venue of Budva, and is the home of Budvanska Riviera volleyball team and RK Budvanska Rivijera handball team. The town&#x27;s basketball team is KK Mogren and RK Budvanska Rivijera is the handball club.

Water polo is a common sport in Budva, as on the rest of the Montenegrin coast. VK Budva is the city&#x27;s water polo team, competing in the regional Adriatic Water Polo League.

Paragliding is a summer activity in Budva. Steep 700m high hills provide perfect setting and stunning vistas for paragliders, with the hamlet of Brajići being the usual launching point.

== Transport ==
Budva is connected to inland Montenegro by two-laned highways. There are two ways to reach Budva from Podgorica – either through Cetinje, or through the Sozina tunnel (opened 2005). Either way, Podgorica, the capital and main road junction in Montenegro, is around away.

Budva is connected to the rest of the coastal towns of Montenegro by the Adriatic Highway, which extends from Ulcinj in the far south to Herceg Novi in the north, and on to Croatia.

Tivat Airport is away. There are regular flights to Belgrade and Moscow throughout the year, and dozens of seasonal and charter flights land daily at the airport during the summer season. Podgorica Airport is away, and it has regular flights to a number of European destinations throughout the year.

Urban transport consists of Mediteran Express buses, which operate between Budva&#x27;s city center and Sveti Stefan. This line services a large portion of the Budva urban core, as well as some small towns between Budva and Sveti Stefan.

The closest train station is Sutomore. This stop on the Belgrade–Bar railway is some away from Budva&#x27;s city center.

<doc id="555061" wikidata="Q1235396" url="?curid=555061" title="Dolcetto">
<text>Dolcetto ( , , ) is a black Italian wine grape variety widely grown in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy. The Italian word &quot;dolcetto&quot; means &quot;little sweet one&quot;, but it is not certain that the name originally carried any reference to the grape’s sugar levels: it is possible that it derives from the name of the hills where the vine is cultivated. In any case the wines produced are nearly always dry. They can be tannic and fruity with moderate, or decidedly low, levels of acidity and are typically meant to be consumed within a few years after release.

==History==
One theory suggests the grape originated in France and was brought to Monferrato sometime in the 11th century. A competing theory has the grape originating in the Piedmontese village of Dogliani. In 1593, an ordinance of the municipality of Dogliani which forbade the harvesting of grapes earlier than Saint Matthew&#x27;s Day, unless an exceptional authorization had been granted, has been taken to refer to this variety, which is still known in local dialects under the names and . A document of 1633 records the presence of Dolcetto in the cellars of the Arboreo family of Valenza. In 1700, Barnabà Centurione sent the wine as a gift to Queen Anne of Great Britain.

Along with the French grape Chatus, Dolcetto is a parent variety to several Piedmontese grapes including Valentino nero, Passus and San Martino.

==Regions==
Most Dolcetto is found in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy, where many of the top estates produce Dolcetto on less favoured sites as an &quot;early to market wine&quot; to generate some income for the winery while the Nebbiolo and Barbera are being matured. It is particularly associated with the towns of Dogliani and Diano d&#x27;Alba in the province of Cuneo, although the greatest volumes come from around Alba and Ovada. The grape is also found in Liguria under the name &quot;Ormeasco&quot;, and in the Oltrepò Pavese where it is called &quot;Nebbiolo&quot; or &quot;Nibièu&quot;.

Of the 100% Dolcetto DOCs, all but one have two levels, the &quot;standard&quot; version typically requiring a minimum 11.5% ABV, and the &quot;Superiore&quot; at 12.5% ABV. They are Dolcetto di Dogliani (DOCG since 2005), Dolcetto d&#x27;Acqui, Dolcetto d&#x27;Alba, Dolcetto d&#x27;Asti, Dolcetto delle Langhe Monregalesi (integrated to Dogliani DOCG in 2011), Dolcetto di Diano d&#x27;Alba and Dolcetto d&#x27;Ovada. Only Langhe Dolcetto has no &quot;Superiore&quot; variety. Of the blended wines, Riviera Ligure di Ponente Ormeasco requires a minimum of 95% Dolcetto/Ormeasco; Colli Tortonesi Dolcetto, Monferrato Dolcetto and Pineronese Dolcetto a minimum of 85%, and Valsusa a minimum of 60%. Golfo Del Tigullio can be between 20-70%, while Lago di Corbara and Rosso Orvietano contain less than 20% Dolcetto.

Outside of Italy, Dolcetto is known as &quot;Douce Noire&quot; in Savoie and &quot;Charbono&quot; in California. However, DNA fingerprinting done at the University of California, Davis has shown that the actual &quot;Douce Noire&quot; and &quot;Charbono&quot; vines are not, in fact, Dolcetto, but two different vines. In spite of this confirmation, some plantings of true Dolcetto vines still retain the local synonyms in some areas of Savoie and California.

The grape was first brought to California by expatriate Italians, and is most popular in Lodi AVA, Mendocino County, Russian River Valley AVA, Napa Valley AVA, Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, Sta. Rita Hills AVA, and Santa Barbara County. The Dolcetto grape is gaining popularity in the Washington State Lake Chelan AVA (C R Sandidge Wines Purtteman Estate vineyard). There are also some plantings in the Oregon AVAs of Umpqua Valley AVA and Southern Oregon AVA, Michigan&#x27;s Leelanau Peninsula AVA (Ciccone Vineyard &amp; Winery), as well as the statewide appellations of New Mexico and Pennsylvania.

Australia is home to the oldest current plantings of Dolcetto, with vines dating back to the 1860s.

===Dogliani DOCG===
Dogliani, and Dogliani Superiore are Italian red wines produced in the Langhe using only the Dolcetto grape variety. The wines were recognized as DOC in 1974 under the name Dolcetto di Dogliani. In 2005, the original DOC was revoked and gradually replaced by a DOCG named Dogliani. The yield of grapes is restricted to eight metric tons per hectare for Dogliani and seven for Dogliani Superiore. Furthermore, to qualify for Superiore status, the wines must be aged for at least one year. The vineyards are restricted to the hilly areas within the boundaries of the communes of Bastia Mondovì, Belvedere Langhe, Briaglia, Castellino Tanaro, Cigliè, Clavesana, Dogliani, Farigliano, Igliano, Marsaglia, Monchiero, Niella Tanaro, Piozzo and Rocca Cigliè, plus parts of the communes of Carrù, Mondovì, Murazzano, Roddino, San Michele Mondovì, Somano and Vicoforte.
==Wines==

Dolcetto wines are known for black cherry and liquorice with some prune flavours, and a characteristically bitter finish reminiscent of almonds. While the name implies sweetness, the wines are normally dry. The tannic nature of the grape contributes to a characteristic bitter finish. The dark purple skin of Dolcetto grapes has high amounts of anthocyanins, which require only a short maceration time with the skin to produce a dark-coloured wine. The amount of skin contact affects the resulting tannin levels in the wine, with most winemakers preferring to limit maceration time to as short as possible. During fermentation, the wine is prone to the wine fault of reduction.

==Food pairing==
Overall, Dolcetto is considered a light easy drinking red wine that pairs well with pastas and pizza dishes.

<doc id="555062" wikidata="Q3132913" url="?curid=555062" title="Henry Leavenworth">
<text>Henry Leavenworth (December 10, 1783 – July 21, 1834) was an American soldier active in the War of 1812 and early military expeditions against the Plains Indians. He established Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. The city of Leavenworth, Kansas; Leavenworth County, Kansas; and the Leavenworth Penitentiary are named after him.

==Early life and education==
He was born at New Haven, Connecticut, a son of Col. Jesse and Catharine (Conklin) Leavenworth. Soon after his birth, his parents became alienated, and his father moved with the children to Danville, Vermont, where he was educated. He then read law with General Erastus Root of Delhi, New York, and upon being admitted to the bar, he formed a partnership with his preceptor that lasted until 1812.

==Military career==
===War of 1812===
Leavenworth was commissioned as a captain in the 25th U. S. Infantry in April 1812, shortly before the outbreak of the War of 1812. In August 1813 he was promoted to major of the 9th Infantry. He was wounded at the Battle of Niagara on July 25, 1814, and the following November, he was brevetted to the rank of colonel.

===Post war===
After the war, he then served in the New York State Assembly, in 1816, and then he went to Prairie du Chien as Indian agent, and on February 10, 1818, was made lieutenant-colonel of the Fifth U. S. Infantry. In 1820 he began constructing Fort St. Anthony from the &quot;Cantonment New Hope&quot; stockade.

===Later career===
In 1823, he led U.S. Army troops in the Arikara War, the first U.S. military expedition against a Great Plains Indian nation. While on duty in the West he built several military posts, one of which was Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, established May 8, 1827 as &quot;Cantonment Leavenworth&quot;, now one of the leading military establishments of the country. In 1825 he was made brigadier-general by brevet. In December 1825 he was promoted to the Regular Army rank of colonel and placed in command of the 3rd Infantry Regiment. During his time commanding the 3rd Infantry, he spent time at Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri.

In 1834 he commanded the United States Regiment of Dragoons during its expedition from Fort Gibson, Indian Territory to the Wichita Mountains. The artist George Catlin was also in this expedition, and wrote of Leavenworth&#x27;s death. They hoped to meet and open formal relations among the United States and the Comanche, Kiowa, and Wichita peoples.

==Death==
General Leavenworth died in the Cross Timbers in the Indian Territory, on land near modern Kingston, Oklahoma, on July 21, 1834, of either sickness or an accident while buffalo-hunting; while leading an expedition against the Pawnee and Comanche. His regiment erected a monument at Cross Timbers; he was first buried in Delhi, with his remains later reinterred at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery.

==Marriages==
He was married three times, first to Elizabeth Eunice Morrison, with whom he had two children, and divorced, then to Electa Knapp, who died within the year, then to Harriet Lovejoy, with whom he had another child. Lake Harriet in Minneapolis is named for Harriet Lovejoy.

His son Jesse Henry Leavenworth was also a military careerist.

==Legacy==
In addition to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Leavenworth County, Kansas, the Leavenworth Penitentiary, Henry Leavenworth Elementary School, and Leavenworth Street in Omaha are named after him. The United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth is commonly called &quot;Leavenworth&quot;.

<text>The American Volunteer Groups were volunteer air units organized by the United States government to aid the Nationalist government of China against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The only unit to actually see combat was the 1st AVG, popularly known as the Flying Tigers.

To aid the Nationalist government of China and to put pressure on Japan, President Franklin Roosevelt in April 1941 authorized the creation of a clandestine &quot;Special Air Unit&quot; consisting of three combat groups equipped with American aircraft and staffed by aviators and technicians to be recruited from the U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps for service in China. The program was fleshed out in the winter of 1940–1941 by Claire Lee Chennault, then an air advisor to the Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, and Lauchlin Currie, a young economist in the Roosevelt White House. They envisioned a small air corps of 500 combat aircraft, although in the end, the number was reduced to 200 fighters and 66 light bombers.

==1st AVG (Flying Tigers)==


The 1st American Volunteer Group were recruited starting on 15 April 1941, when an unpublished executive order was signed by President Roosevelt. One hundred Curtiss P-40Bs were obtained from Curtiss-Wright, by convincing the British Government to take a later more advanced batch of P-40s in exchange. The group assembled at RAF Mingaladon in Burma by November 1941 for training, where it was organized into three squadrons and established a headquarters. After the Japanese invasion of Burma, the AVG fought alongside the Royal Air Force in defense of Rangoon Under Chennault&#x27;s command, the Flying Tigers became famous in the defense of Burma and China. It was disbanded and replaced by the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; (AAF) 23rd Fighter Group in July 1942, with only five of its pilots choosing to continue with the AAF.

==2nd AVG==
In the fall of 1941, the 2nd American Volunteer Group was equipped with 33 Lockheed Hudson (A-28) and 33 Douglas DB-7 (A-20) bombers originally built for Britain but acquired by the U.S. Army as part of the Lend-Lease program passed earlier in the year. The Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company, fronting for the Chinese and American governments, recruited 82 pilots and 359 ground crew from the U.S. Army in the fall of 1941 and an undetermined number, including one pilot, sailed for Asia aboard &quot;Bloemfontein&quot; of the Java-Pacific line. Other pilots reported to San Francisco and were scheduled to depart aboard the Lockheed Hudsons on 10 December. The Douglas DB-7s were to have gone by freighter to Africa, to be assembled and ferried to China but the 7 December 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor caused the program to be aborted. The vessels at sea were diverted to Australia, the aircraft were taken back into American service and most of the personnel rejoined the military, either in Australia or in the U.S.

==3rd AVG==
The 3rd AVG was to have been a fighter group like the 1st. Because the 2nd AVG had been recruited from the U.S. Army, recruiting for the 3rd was to have been limited to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, starting in the early months of 1942. These plans too were abandoned as a result of the U.S. entry into World War II.

<doc id="555070" wikidata="Q1267369" url="?curid=555070" title="Durif">
<text>Durif is a variety of red wine grape primarily grown in Australia, California, France, and Israel. Since the end of the 20th century, wineries located in Washington&#x27;s Yakima River Valley, Maryland, Arizona, Texas, West Virginia, Chile, Mexico&#x27;s Baja California Peninsula, and Ontario&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula have also produced wines from Durif grapes. It is the main grape known in the U.S. and Israel as Petite Sirah, with over 90% of the California plantings labeled &quot;Petite Sirah&quot; being Durif grapes; the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recognizes &quot;Durif&quot; and &quot;Petite Sirah&quot; as synonyms for the same grape. It produces tannic wines with a spicy, plummy flavour. The grape originated as a cross of Syrah pollen germinating a Peloursin plant. On some occasions, Peloursin and Syrah vines may be called Petite Sirah, usually because the varieties are extremely difficult to distinguish in old age.

== History ==
In the 1860s the French botanist François Durif kept a nursery of several grape varieties at his home in the commune of Tullins where he most likely had plantings of both Peloursin and Syrah. At some point the two vines cross pollinated and Durif discovered a new grape variety growing in his nursery. It was identified and named &quot;Plant du Rif&quot; (later Durif) by ampelographer Victor Pulliat in 1868.

As a conclusion of DNA fingerprinting at the University of California, Davis in 1997, Syrah was identified as the source of the pollen that originally crossed with Peloursin flowers. The grape&#x27;s high resistance to downy mildew encouraged its cultivation in the early 20th century in areas like Isère and Ardèche, although the relative low quality of the resulting wine caused the grape to fall out of favor with local wine authorities. Today, it is almost nonexistent in France.

== Regional production ==
Australia and California are now the two leading producers of Durif. The grape can also be found in Israel, Brazil, Argentina, Texas, Chile, and Mexico.

=== Australia ===
Confirmed as recently as 2024, old plantings of Durif continued to be used to produce popular wine in the Rutherglen, Victoria region of Australia. Durif is now grown in other wine regions of Australia, such as Riverina and Riverland, with over under cultivation by 2000.

=== United States ===

DNA fingerprinting has shown that the majority of Petite Sirah plantings in California are actually Durif. Some vineyards were found to be a field blend of Durif and other varieties, such as Mondeuse noire, all labeled as &quot;Petite Sirah&quot;. The vine is a popular planting in Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, Monterey and San Joaquin County. In addition to being produced as a varietal wine, the grape is sometimes blended with Zinfandel. In years when heavy rain or the excess sun has weakened the quality or yield of Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot noir plantings, Petite Sirah may also be used as a blending partner to strengthen the wine. The average age of Petite Sirah vines tends to be older than that of most Californian vines.

As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Petite Sirah and Durif in 27 CFR § 4.91 as approved grape varieties for American wines, but they are not listed as synonyms. This means that U.S. producers can produce Durif wine, but not label it as Petite Sirah, and vice versa. The ATF proposed that they be recognised as synonyms in &quot;Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 941&quot;, published in the Federal Register on 10 April 2002, but a decision on RIN 1513–AA32 (formerly RIN 1512-AC65) appears to be postponed indefinitely, probably because the new regulation is tied up in the trade dispute that would see the TTB recognise Primitivo as a synonym for Zinfandel.

While not one of the officially sanctioned grapes of the Côtes du Rhône AOC, Petite Sirah&#x27;s linking to Durif caused the California&#x27;s Rhone Rangers to add the grape to its listings of wine in 2002.

=== Israel ===

In Israel, Petite Sirah had a history much like that in California—historically used as a blending grape to add body to inferior wines. However, Petite Sirah has recently experienced somewhat of a revival, both in high-end blends and bottled as a single or majority variety. The UC Davis-trained winemaker and Ph.D. chemist Ya&#x27;ir Margalit, familiar with the grape from his time in California, showed that Petite Sirah need not be consigned to jug wine when he blended small portions into his reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. In 2002 winemaker Assaf Paz made his first varietal Petite Sirah in his family winery Vitkin winery and in 2004 in Carmel winery where his was employed. Seeing that Israeli &quot;terroir&quot; could grow great Petite Sirah, wineries such as Lewis Pasco the founding winemaker at Recanati followed suit with a Petite Sirah/Zinfandel blend, while others like Sea Horse, Carmel, Tishbi have made single-varietal Petite Sirah in addition to using it for blending.

== Petite Sirah and Petite Syrah ==
Petite Sirah is sometimes mistakenly spelled &quot;Petite Syrah,&quot; which has historically referred to a small berried clone of the Syrah grape by Rhône growers. In California, immigrant vine growers introduced Syrah in 1878 and used the phrase &quot;Petite Syrah&quot; to refer to the lower yields that the vines then were producing in California. Actual Petite Sirah (Durif) was then introduced in 1884.

== Viticulture ==

The &quot;petite&quot; in the name of this grape refers to the size of its berries and not the vine, which is particularly vigorous. The leaves are large, with a bright green upper surface and paler green lower surface. The grape forms tightly packed clusters that can be susceptible to rotting in rainy environments. The small berries create a high skin to juice ratio, which can produce very tannic wines if the juice goes through an extended maceration period. In the presence of new oak barrels, the wine can develop an aroma of melted chocolate.

In the 20th century, ampelographers Louis Levadoux and (decades later) Linda Bisson categorized Durif as a member of the Pelorsien eco-geogroup along with Bia blanc, Béclan, Dureza, Exbrayat, Jacquère, Joubertin, Mondeuse blanche, Peloursin, Servanin and Verdesse.

== Wine ==

Petite Sirah produces dark, inky colored wines that are relatively acidic, with firm texture and mouth feel; the aroma has herbal and black pepper overtones, and typically offers flavors of blue fruit, black fruit, plums, and especially blueberries. The wines are very tannic, with aging ability that can exceed 20 years in the bottle. Petite Sirah can sometimes be rather &quot;short&quot;, that is, the flavor does not linger in the mouth, hence the benefit of blending with another grape which may lack mid-palate depth, but adds length and elegance.

<text>STS-81 was a January 1997 Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; mission to the Mir space station.

==Crew==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Mission highlights==

STS-81 was the fifth of nine planned missions to Mir and the second one involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. Astronaut John Blaha, who had been on Mir since September 19, 1996, was replaced by astronaut Jerry Linenger. Linenger spent more than four months on Mir. He returned to Earth on Space Shuttle Mission STS-84.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; carried the SPACEHAB double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. During the five days of docked operations with Mir, the crews transferred water and supplies from one spacecraft to the other. A spacewalk by Linenger and one of his Russian cosmonaut crewmates occurred after the departure of &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

The STS-81 mission included several experiments in the fields of advanced technology, Earth sciences, fundamental biology, human life sciences, microgravity, and space sciences. It was hoped that data would supply insight for the planning and development of the International Space Station, Earth-based sciences of human and biological processes, and the advancement of commercial technology.

On January 18, while &quot;Atlantis&quot; was docked to Mir, Grunsfeld placed a telephone call to the NPR show Car Talk, hosted by two of Grunsfeld&#x27;s fellow MIT alumni, Tom and Ray Magliozzi.
STS-81 involved the transfer of of logistics to and from the Mir, the largest transfer of items to date. During the docked phase, of water, of U.S. science equipment, of Russian logistics along with of miscellaneous material was transferred to Mir. Returned to Earth aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; was of U.S. science material, of Russian logistics and of miscellaneous material.

First Shuttle flight of 1997 highlighted by return of U.S. astronaut John Blaha to Earth after 118-day stay aboard Russian Space Station Mir and the largest transfer to date of logistics between the two spacecraft. &quot;Atlantis&quot; also returned carrying the first plants to complete a life cycle in space — a crop of wheat grown from seed to seed. This fifth of nine planned dockings continued Phase 1B of the NASA/Russian Space Agency cooperative effort, with Linenger becoming the third U.S. astronaut in succession to live on Mir. Same payload configuration flown on previous docking flight — featuring SPACEHAB Double module — flown again.

Blaha joined Mir 22 crew of Commander Valeri Korzun and Flight Engineer Aleksandr Kaleri on September 19, 1996, when he arrived there with the crew of STS-79. Linenger worked with the Mir 22 crew until the arrival in February of the Mir 23 crew of Commander Vasili Tsibliev, Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin and German researcher Reinhold Ewald. Ewald returned to Earth with the Mir 22 cosmonauts after a brief stay on the station. Astronaut Michael Foale replaced Linenger on Mir when the STS-84 mission arrived in May 1997.
Docking occurred at 22:55 EST, January 14, followed by hatch opening at 00:57 January 15. Linenger officially traded places at 04:45 with Blaha who spent 118 days on the station and 128 days total on-orbit. During five days of mated operations, crews transferred nearly 6,000 pounds (2,722 kilograms) of logistics to Mir, including around of water; around of U.S. science equipment; and of Russian logistical equipment. About of materials returned with &quot;Atlantis&quot; from Mir.

Crew also tested on Shuttle the Treadmill Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS), designed for use in the Russian Service Module of the International Space Station. Another activity related to International Space Station involved firing the orbiter&#x27;s small vernier jet thrusters during mated operations to gather engineering data.

Undocking occurred at 09:15 EST, January 19, followed by fly around of Mir.

No significant in-flight anomalies were experienced with &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15.
Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

==Mission objectives==

The STS-82 mission was the second in a series of planned servicing missions to the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope (&quot;HST&quot;), which had been placed in orbit on April 24, 1990, by &quot;Discovery&quot; during STS-31. The first servicing mission was done by Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on STS-61. Work performed by &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; crew significantly upgraded the scientific capabilities of the HST and helped to keep the telescope functioning smoothly until the next scheduled servicing missions, which were STS-103 in 1999 and STS-109 in 2002.

On the third day of the mission, &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; seven-member crew conducted the first of four spacewalks (also called Extra-vehicular Activities or &quot;EVAs&quot;) to remove two older instruments and install two new astronomy instruments, as well as perform other servicing tasks. The two older instruments being replaced were the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph and the Faint Object Spectrograph, exchanged for the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), respectively.

In addition to installing the new instruments, astronauts replaced other existing hardware with upgrades and spares. Hubble received a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor, an optical device used to provide pointing information for the telescope and as a scientific instrument for astrometric science. The Solid State Recorder (SSR) replaced one of HST&#x27;s reel-to-reel tape recorders. The SSR provides much more flexibility than a reel-to-reel recorder and can store ten times more data. One of Hubble&#x27;s four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) -- part of the telescope&#x27;s Pointing Control Subsystem—was replaced with a refurbished spare. The RWAs use angular momentum to move and maintain the telescope in a desired position. The wheel axes are oriented so that the telescope can provide science with only three wheels operating, if required. Study of the returned mechanism provided a rare opportunity to study equipment that had undergone long-term service (7 years) in space, particularly for the effects of vacuum on lubricants which were found to be in &#x27;excellent condition&#x27;.

==Mission results==

STS-82 demonstrated anew the capability of the Space Shuttle to service orbiting spacecraft. &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; crew completed servicing and upgrading of the Hubble Space Telescope during four planned EVAs, later performing a fifth unscheduled space walk to repair insulation on the telescope.

The Hubble Space Telescope was deployed in April 1990 during STS-31. It was designed to undergo periodic servicing and upgrading over its projected 15-year lifespan, with first servicing performed during STS-61 in December 1993. Hawley, who originally deployed the telescope, operated the orbiter Remote Manipulator System arm on STS-82 to retrieve the telescope for second servicing at 3:34 am EST, Feb 13, and positioned it above &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; payload bay less than half an hour later.

Relying on more than 150 tools and crew aids, Lee and Smith performed EVAs 1, 3 and 5, with Harbaugh and Tanner performing EVAs 2 and 4. EVA 1 began at 11:34 pm EST, February 13, and lasted six hours, 42 minutes. One of Hubble&#x27;s solar arrays was unexpectedly disturbed by a gust of air from &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; airlock when it was depressurized, but was not damaged. Lee and Smith removed two scientific instruments from Hubble, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS), and replaced them with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), respectively. STIS expected to shed further light on supermassive black holes. NICMOS features more capable infrared detectors and gave astronomers their first clear view of the universe at near infrared wavelengths between 0.8 and 2.5 micrometers.

EVA 2 began at 10:25 pm, February 14, and lasted seven hours, 27 minutes. Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a degraded Fine Guidance Sensor and a failed Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with new spares. Also installed was a new unit called the Optical Control Electronics Enhancement Kit, which further increased the capability of the Fine Guidance Sensor. During this EVA astronauts noted cracking and wear on thermal insulation on the side of HST facing sun and in the direction of travel.

EVA 3 began at 9:53 pm, February 15, and lasted seven hours, 11 minutes. Lee and Smith removed and replaced a Data Interface Unit on Hubble, as well as a reel-to-reel Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new digital Solid State Recorder (SSR) that allowed simultaneous recording and playback of data. Also changed out was one of four Reaction Wheel Assembly units that use spin momentum to move telescope toward a target and maintain it in a stable position. After this EVA, mission managers decided to add EVA 5 to repair the thermal insulation on HST.

EVA 4 began at 10:45 pm, February 16, and lasted six hours, 34 minutes. Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a Solar Array Drive Electronics package which controls the positioning of Hubble&#x27;s solar arrays. Also replaced covers over Hubble&#x27;s magnetometers and placed thermal blankets of multi-layer material over two areas of degraded insulation around the light shield portion of the telescope just below the top of the observatory. Meanwhile, inside Discovery Horowitz and Lee worked on the middeck to fabricate new insulation blankets for HST.

Final space walk, EVA 5, lasted five hours, 17 minutes. Lee and Smith attached several thermal insulation blankets to three equipment compartments at the top of the Support Systems Module section of the telescope which contain key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. STS-82 EVA total of 33 hours, 11 minutes is about two hours shy of total EVA time recorded on first servicing mission.

Discovery&#x27;s maneuvering jets fired several times during the mission to reboost the telescope&#x27;s orbit by eight nautical miles. Hubble was redeployed on February 19 at 1:41 am, into a by orbit. Initial checkout of new instruments and equipment during mission showed all were performing nominally. Calibration of the two new science instruments took place over a period of several weeks, with first images and data anticipated in about eight to ten weeks.

<text>STS-83 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission flown by &quot;Columbia&quot;. It was a science research mission that achieved orbit successfully, but the planned duration was a failure due to a technical problem with a fuel cell that resulted in the abort of the 15 day duration. &quot;Columbia&quot; returned to Earth just shy of four days. The mission was re-flown as STS-94 with the same crew later that year.

==Crew==
=== Crew seat assignments ===

==Mission highlights==
This mission was originally launched on April 4, 1997, and was intended to be on orbit for 15 days, 16 hours. The mission was cut short due to a problem with Fuel Cell #2 and it landed on April 8, after 3 days 23 hours. NASA decided to fly the mission again as STS-94, which launched July 1, 1997.

The primary payload on STS-83 was the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL). MSL was a collection of microgravity experiments housed inside a European Spacelab Long Module (LM). It built on the cooperative and scientific foundation of the International Microgravity Laboratory missions (IML-1 on STS-42 and IML-2 on STS-65), the United States Microgravity Laboratory missions (USML-1 on STS-50 and USML-2 on STS-73), the Japanese Spacelab mission (Spacelab-J on STS-47), the Spacelab Life and Microgravity Science Mission (LMS on STS-78) and the German Spacelab missions (D-1 on STS-61-A and D-2 on STS-55).

MSL featured 19 materials science investigations in four major facilities. These facilities were the Large Isothermal Furnace, the EXpedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack, the Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) and the Coarsening in Solid–Liquid Mixtures (CSLM) facility, the Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) and the Combustion Module-1 Facility. Additional technology experiments were to be performed in the Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the High-Packed Digital Television (HI-PAC DTV) system was used to provide multi-channel real-time analog science video.

The Large Isothermal Furnace was developed by the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA) for the STS-47 Spacelab-J mission and was also flown on STS-65 IML-2 mission. It housed the measurement of diffusion coefficient by shear cell method experiment, the diffusion of liquid metals and alloys experiment, the diffusion in liquid led-tin-telluride experiment, the impurity diffusion in ionic melts experiment, the liquid phase sintering II experiment (LIF), and the diffusion processes in molten semiconductors experiment (DPIMS).

The Combustion Module-1 (CM-1) facility from the NASA Lewis Research Center housed experiments on Laminar Soot Processes Experiment and the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number Experiment (SOFBALL).

The Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) is designed to investigate the fundamental combustion aspects of single, isolated droplets under different pressures and ambient oxygen concentrations for a range of droplet sizes varying between and . The DCE apparatus is integrated into a single width MSL Spacelab rack in the cargo bay.

The EXPRESS rack replaces a Spacelab Double rack and special hardware will provide the same structural and resource connections the rack will have on the Space Station. It will house the Physics of Hard Spheres (PHaSE) experiment and the Astro/PGBA Experiment.

The Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) is used for the experiments on nucleation in different flow regimes, thermophysical properties of advanced materials in the undercooled liquid state experiment, measurements of the surface tension of liquid and undercooled metallic alloys by oscillating drop technique experiment, alloy undercooling experiments, the study of the morphological stability of growing dendrites by comparative dendrite velocity measurements on pure ni and dilute Ni–C alloy in the Earth and space laboratory experiment, the undercooled melts of alloys with polytetrahedral short-range order experiment, the thermal expansion of glass forming metallic alloys in the undercooled state experiment, the AC calorimetry and thermophysical properties of bulk glass-forming metallic liquids experiment and the measurement of surface tension and viscosity of undercooled liquid metals experiment.

There were also experiments on measuring microgravity. They included the space acceleration measurement system (SAMS), the microgravity measurement assembly (MMA), the quasi-steady acceleration measurement system and the orbital acceleration research experiment (OARE).

The middeck glovebox (MGBX) facility supported the bubble and drop nonlinear dynamics (BDND) experiment, the study of the fundamental operation of a capillary-driven heat transfer (CHT) device in microgravity experiment, the internal flows in a free drop (IFFD) experiment and the fiber-supported droplet combustion experiment (FSDC-2).
==Reflight==

Prior to launch, and continuing through the early part of the mission, flight controllers on the ground were monitoring an anomaly within the electrical power generating Fuel Cell #2 (of three), making it appear that oxygen and hydrogen might be starting to uncontrollably mix, which could lead to detonation (a similar scenario that caused the explosion on Apollo 13). Despite troubleshooting, the anomaly persisted and appeared to worsen. Mission Flight Rules required that the fuel cell be shut down once a certain voltage threshold had been crossed, and with only two of three fuel cells working, that invoked another Flight Rule which required the mission be terminated early (loss of a second fuel cell would require severe and dangerous powerdowns, though the shuttle operates normally on two). Payload Specialist Dr. Linteris described the mission as &quot;an exercise in crisis management. The main bus alarm was going off continually.&quot;

Astronaut Chris Hadfield served as CAPCOM for STS-83. He cited NASA&#x27;s decision to terminate the mission as a positive example of applying the Flight Rules body of knowledge to ensure astronaut safety: &quot;The beauty of &quot;Flight Rules&quot; is that they create certainty when we have to make tough calls... In real time, the temptation to take a chance is always higher. However, the flight rules were unequivocal: the Shuttle had to return to Earth.&quot;

Upon landing, mission managers decided that &quot;Columbia&quot; did not need to be processed per a typical end of mission maintenance flow. Instead, they called for an unprecedented reflight of the same mission, once the normal processing could be completed (refill the propellant tanks and other consumables like oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and water, change out the main engines, etc.). The same crew flew the reflight, which was designated STS-94 (the next available unused shuttle mission number at the time), three months later, in July 1997. The crew patch was updated with the reflight, changing the outer border from red to blue and changing the flight number from 83 to 94.

<text>Furmint (also known as Mainak) is a white Hungarian wine grape variety that is most noted widely grown in the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region where it is used to produce single-varietal dry wines as well as being the principal grape in the better known Tokaji dessert wines. It is also grown in the tiny Hungarian wine region of Somló. Furmint plays a similar role in the Slovakian wine region of Tokaj. It is also grown in Austria where it is known as &quot;Mosler&quot;. Smaller plantings are found in Slovenia where it is known as &quot;Šipon&quot;. The grape is also planted in Croatia and Serbia, where it is known as &quot;Moslavac&quot;. It is also found in Romania and in former republics of the Soviet Union. Furmint is a late ripening variety. For dry wines the harvest starts usually in September, however sweet wine specific harvest can start in the second half of October or even later, and is often affected by &quot;Botrytis&quot;.

The name Furmint may have been taken from the word &quot;froment&quot; for the wheat-gold color of the wine it produces. While it is possible that the grape was brought to Hungary in the 13th century during the reign of King Béla IV, ampelographers believe that the grape is likely native to the region.

== History ==
Furmint has been growing in the Tokaji region of north-eastern Hungary since at least the late 16th century when a document dated May 15, 1571 described the grape growing in the Hétszőlő vineyard in Tokaj. In 1611, the grape was also noted to have been growing in the Gyepű Valley of the Zemplén Mountains near the town of Erdőbénye, about north of Tokaj.

While many other wine grapes have been used in the production of the historic Tokaji dessert wine, Furmint&#x27;s use for the wine was well established by at least the late 18th century when, in 1796, the Hungarian politician János Dercsényi described Furmint as the &quot;genuine Tokaji Aszú&quot; grape.

=== Origins ===

In the early 21st century, DNA analysis confirmed that a parent-offspring relationship exist between Furmint and the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc. As Gouais blanc, has been noted in documents since the early Middle Ages and has been well established as the parent of several grape varieties such as Riesling, Chardonnay, Elbling and Gamay, ampelographers believe that Furmint is likely the offspring of Gouais blanc instead of the other way around.

DNA analysis also suggested that parent-offspring relationships exist with the Hungarian wine grape Hárslevelű and the Swiss wine grape Plantscher but instead of either being the second parent to Furmint with Gouais blanc, ampelographers believe that it is more likely that Furmint is one of the parent variety for both grapes.

Like Pinot noir, Sangiovese and many other grape varieties, Furmint has beget over centuries a variety of clones, including a pink-skinned color mutation known as &quot;Piros Furmint&quot;. As nearly all of these clones are found, almost exclusively, within the Tokaji region, ampelographers believe that it is highly probable that Furmint originated in this part of Hungary.

=== Other theories ===

Other theories of Furmint&#x27;s origins have the grape being introduced to the Austro-Hungarian area in the Middle Ages. As noted by Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the grape may have been brought to Hungary in the 13th century during the reign of King Béla IV. Following the destruction of the Mongolian invasion of Hungary, Béla wanted to quickly revive the country&#x27;s devastated vineyards. The king instituted several policies encouraging mass immigration of people knowledgeable in viticulture and winemaking. Many of the immigrants that heeded Béla&#x27;s call brought new grape varieties with them - one of which may have been Furmint.

Another theory has the grape being introduced even early by Italian missionaries during the reign of Stephen II of Hungary. This theory, as noted by the French ampelographer Pierre Galet, could have Furmint originating from the Lazio city of Formia located along the Appian Way with the name being a corruption of Formia&#x27;s Latin name &quot;Formianum&quot;. A later Italian introduction is credited to a soldier from Collio Goriziano region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia who fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War between 1754 (sometimes dated to 1756) and 1763. The soldier, who was nicknamed &quot;Forment&quot; from the Italian &quot;fromento&quot; for &quot;wheat&quot; due to his wheat-colored, reddish blonde beard, was granted the title of Count of Formentin by Empress Maria Theresa. In gratitude, according to this legend, the Count sent grapevines from his native land to the Empress who had them planted in Tokaji.

However, ampelographers often dismiss these Italian origin theories because, in addition to documentation showing Furmint growing in Hungary before the Seven Years&#x27; War, DNA evidence has not connected Furmint to any Italian grape variety (as a sibling or, more likely, a parent through a natural crossing) which would seem unlikely if Furmint did originate in Italy.

Other theories for Furmint&#x27;s origin note the grape&#x27;s similarities to the Savoy wine grape Altesse and speculate that the grape may have originated there or even in Byzantium where, according to legend, Altesse was brought back to Savoy in 1367 by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy. The Syrmia region with Serbia has also been listed as one potential birthplace for the grape.

== Viticulture ==

Furmint is a late-ripening grape variety that also tends to buds early in the growing season which can make the grapevine susceptible to springtime frosts. While the loose-bunches and thick-skins of the berries make Furmint ideal for producing botrytized dessert wines, the grape can be susceptible to the viticultural hazard of powdery mildew. The Furmint vine has a high tolerance for drought condition which can allow the grape to be planted in regions with limited irrigation sources.

In Hungary, Furmint has shown a high degree of genetic diversity with several clones and color mutation of the grape being propagated in the Tokaji region. Several of these clones, including the Fehér (white), Holyagos and Madárkás clones were well known and in production prior to World War II. Other common clones of Furmint used in wine production includes the loose-berried Lazafürtű and the Változó (variable) clone and the pink-skinned color mutation of Piros Furmint. Ampelographers have noted the proliferation of so many clones of Furmint found almost exclusively in the Tokaj region of Hungary are strong indicators that the grape likely originated in this region as opposed to be introduced from another area.

== Relationship to other grapes ==

DNA profiling conducted at the University of Zagreb has shown Furmint to be likely to have a parent-offspring relationship with Gouais blanc, which similar research elsewhere has shown to be a parent of numerous other varieties, making Furmint a half-sibling to nearly 80 different grape varieties. Furmint has also been confirmed to be the same grape as the Croatian white variety &quot;Moslavac&quot;.

Currently, there are only two known (or suspected) natural crossings of Furmint—the Tokaji wine grape Hárslevelű and the Swiss wine grape Plantscher. In 1937, Furmint was crossed with the Croatian wine grape Malvazija Istarska to create Vega. The grape has also been used to create the Italian wine grapes Bussanello (with Riesling Italico) and Fubiano (with Trebbiano) and the Hungarian grape Oremus/Zéta (with Bouvier).

=== Confusion with other varieties ===
Furmint shares a wide range of synonyms with several other European grape varieties - such as Sauvignon vert which was once known under the synonym of Tocai Friulano even though the grape was probably never used in the production of Tokay. To confuse things further, not only does Furmint share several synonyms with Sauvignon vert but &quot;Sauvignon vert&quot; itself is a synonym for the &quot;green berry&quot; sub-variety of Furmint. This, coupled with physical similarities between several strains of white grapevines makes identification of different wines, particularly those in developing Eastern European countries difficult.

The grape shares some morphological similarities with the Savoy wine grape Altesse and has been historically confused with the French wine grape variety. In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with Kéknyelű while on the island of Korčula, in Croatia, the grape has been confused with Pošip. The Romanian wine grape Grasă de Cotnari and the Bosnian wine grape Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often confused with the grape.

== Wine regions ==

In 2006, there were of Furmint in cultivation in Hungary, more than 97% of which found in the Tokaj-Hegyalja region. The remaining plantings are found in the western Hungarian region of Somló. In Tokaj, the grape is often blended with Hárslevelű and Sárga Muskotály (Muscat blanc à Petits Grains) to produce the noble rot-influenced dessert wine Tokaji. Around the villages of Mád, Tállya, Rátka and Tolcsva in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County, the grape has a long history of being used for dry wine production as well. Dry Furmint came to the attention of wine connoisseurs and experts of the world when the Úrágya 2000 single vineyard selection was introduced by István Szepsy. The wine expressed great minerality, complexity and structure, which has been experienced only in the finest white wines of historic regions like Burgundy or the Mosel before. The aging potential was also promising. In 2003 more producers of Mád village produced single vineyard selected dry Furmint wines with great success. 
Mád village with its almost 1200 ha had the opportunity to produce high quality dry Furmint wine in significant quantity as a commune level wine, which can express the unique volcanic terroir of the region. 
=== Outside Hungary ===
Outside Hungary, it is found planted around the Crimea where producers have endeavored to make their own versions of Tokaji. For the same reason, small plantings of the grape have been done in the Swartland region of South Africa. In Austria it is most commonly found in Burgenland (where is known as &quot;Zapfner&quot;)) and Styria (where it is known as &quot;Mosler&quot;).

In the Burgenland region (now in Austria), Furmint was historically associated with the production of the sweet dessert wine &quot;Ausbruch&quot;. The grape gradually fell out of favor in the Burgenland but in the 21st century, several &quot;Ausbruch&quot; winemakers (particularly around Rust) have been rediscovering the grape&#x27;s potential in their area. In 2010, there were of the grape in cultivation in Austria, mostly around Rust.

Across the border from Hungary, in Slovakia, Furmint is most commonly used in the production of sweet wines in the Tokaj region that includes several towns within the Trebišov District: Bara, Čerhov, Černochov, Malá Tŕňa, Slovenské Nové Mesto, Veľká Tŕňa, and Viničky.

In Slovenia, Furmint is known as Šipon with in cultivation in 2009, mostly along the Podravina river in the Styria region. Here the grape is often made as a varietal wine in both dry and sweet, Tokaji-like styles. Furmint is also known as Šipon in Croatia (where it is also known as Moslavac) as well. Here the grape is almost always used to make dry style wine with of the variety in cultivation as of 2008. In Zagreb County of the Moslavina region, Croatian wine producers have also been experimenting with using Furmint in sparkling wines, often blended with Chardonnay and Pinot blanc.
In the United States, there are some isolated plantings of Furmint in the California wine region of the Russian River AVA of Sonoma County.

== Wines and styles ==
Furmint can be produced in a variety of styles ranging from bone dry to extremely sweet wines affected by noble rot. The grape has the potential to produce wines with naturally high levels of acidity with complex flavors derived from phenolic compounds in the juice and through brief contact with the grape skins. Furmint wines, particularly the botrytized dessert wines, can have immense aging potential with some well made examples from favorable vintages continuing to age for over a century. These wines, described by wine expert Oz Clarke as nearly &quot;immortal&quot;, are most often the &quot;aszú&quot; style wines of Tokaji made from the top 10-15% of Furmint harvested. This potential comes from the balance of acidity and high levels of sugars in the wine which act as preservatives during the aging process.

Dry styles of Furmint are characterized by their aroma notes of smoke, pears and lime. Dessert style wines can develop notes of marzipan, blood orange, apricots and barley sugar. As these dessert styles of Furmint age they will often develop more smokey and spicy notes of tobacco, tea, cinnamon and even chocolate.

<text>Chiclayo (; Mochica: &quot;Cɥiclaiæp&quot;) is the principal city and capital of the Lambayeque region and Chiclayo Province in northern Peru. It is located 13 kilometers (8.1 mi) from the Pacific coast, 208 kilometers from the city of Trujillo and 770 kilometers (480 mi) from the country&#x27;s capital, Lima. It was founded under the name of &quot;Santa María de los Valles de Chiclayo&quot;.

The city was originally founded by Spanish explorers as &quot;Santa María de los Valles de Chiclayo&quot; in the 16th century, acting as a small town of passage and rest of travelers. It was declared an official city on 15 April 1835 by president Felipe Santiago Salaverry. He named Chiclayo &quot;the Heroic City&quot; to recognize the courage of its citizens in the fight for independence, a title it still holds. Other nicknames for Chiclayo include &quot;The Capital of Friendship&quot; and the &quot;Pearl of the North&quot;, due to its kind and friendly nature of its people.

Chiclayo is Peru&#x27;s fourth-largest city, after Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo, with a population of 738,000 as of 2011. The Lambayeque region is the fourth most populous metropolitan area of Peru, with a population of 972,713 in 2009. The city is divided into three urban districts, Chiclayo, La Victoria, and José Leonardo Ortiz. The Chiclayo metropolitan area comprises 12 districts. It is the second most populous city in Northern Peru, after its city rival, Trujillo. The city was founded near an important prehistoric archaeological site, the Northern Wari ruins, which constitute the remains of a city from the 7th to 12th century of the Wari Empire. The city was also once part of the Moche culture, which dominated Northern Peru 100 to 700 AD. The Lord of Sipán was the ruler of the Moche and the Sipán mummies are the most popular tourist attraction of city of Lambayeque and Chiclayo, with most tourists arriving from Chiclayo. The Royal Tombs of Sipán Museum in Lambayeque houses thousands of Moche artifacts. 

==Etymology==
Many different historical accounts tell of the naming of &quot;Chiclayo&quot;. Some attribute it to an indigenous man known as &quot;chiclayoc&quot; or &quot;chiclayep&quot; who transported plaster between the ancient cities of Zaña, Lambayeque and Morrope.

Another version claims that around the time that the city was founded, the area was home to a green-colored fruit called &quot;chiclayep&quot; or &quot;chiclayop,&quot; which in the Mochican language means &quot;green that hangs&quot;. In some towns in the highlands of Cajamarca, squashes are known as &quot;chiclayos&quot;, evidence that this fruit is the origin of the city&#x27;s name.

Another source indicates that the word is a translation from the extinct Moche language and is derived from the word &quot;Cheqta&quot; which means &quot;half&quot; and &quot;yoc&quot; which means &quot;property of&quot;.

Others say the Mochican language had words similar to the name, such as &quot;Chiclayap&quot; or &quot;Chekliayok&quot;, which means &quot;place where there are green branches&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian cultures===

====Mochica culture====
The Moche civilization began between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, occupying a territory that spanned much of what is now the northern coast of Peru, encompassing what is today the coastal area of the departments of Ancash, Lambayeque and La Libertad. This civilization developed a broad knowledge of hydraulic engineering: its people constructed canals to create an irrigation system in order to support agriculture. They produced surpluses, which supported population density and a strong economy for development. The culture was characterized by intensive use of copper in the manufacture of ornamental objects, tools and weapons. The Moche civilization was one of the largest and most influential in Peru, and ruins and archeological sites of the Moche, especially the Lord of Sipán, became large tourist destinations. 

During the Moche times, Pampa Grande, near Chiclayo, was a major regional capital.

The Mochicans produced ceramics with elaborate designs, representing religious themes, humans, animals, and scenes of ceremonies and myths reflecting their perception of the world. They were famous for huaco-portraits, which are preserved in museums around the country, highlighting amazing expressiveness, perfection, and realism. The civilization disappeared as a result of disasters caused by El Niño.

====Sican culture====

The Sican culture (or Lambayeque culture) existed between 700 and 1375AD and occupied the territory that is now the department of Lambayeque, including present-day Chiclayo.

This culture formed towards the end of the Moche civilization and assimilated much of the Moche knowledge and cultural traditions. At its peak, (900-1100), it extended over almost the entire Peruvian coast. The Sican excelled in architecture, jewelry and navigation. A thirty-year drought around the year 1020 hastened the fall of this civilization, along with multiple El Niño disasters .

Soon after, the territories of the Sican Culture were controlled by the Chimu Empire, which would absorb the goldsmithing techniques of the Sicán in the handling of gold and silver, integrating its population into this kingdom. Finally, the Chimu would be conquered by the Inca Pachacutec, in the Inca expansion to the north, integrating the region into the Chinchaysuyo of the Inca empire until the Spanish conquest by Francisco Pizarro.

=== Colonial period ===

In the early 16th century, Chiclayo was inhabited by two ethnic groups; the Cinto and Collique. The chieftains of these ethnic groups donated part of their land for the construction of a Franciscan convent. This section of land was approved by the royal decree of 17 September 1585. Thus, with the advocation of Saint Maria of Chiclayo and under the direction of Father Fray Antonio of the Concepción, a church and a Franciscan convent were erected at Chiclayo. At the time of construction of these Spanish-built edifices, the city of Chiclayo was founded. Unlike other major Peruvian colonial cities such as Lima, Piura, Trujillo, or Arequipa, Chiclayo was inhabited by a largely indigenous population rather than Spanish colonizers.

During his expedition, Francisco Pizarro passed through the region of Chiclayo, on his last expedition on his way to Cajamarca, reaching Zaña. At this place the road forked in two, one to the south and the other to Cajamarca, taking the latter in order to meet Incan emperor, Atahualpa, despite the fact that some members of the expedition to Peru suggested that he continue south to what is now Arequipa.

The town was part of the Intendancy of Trujillo that came to have nine districts that were Trujillo, Lambayeque, Piura, Cajamarca, Huamachuco, Chota, Moyobamba, Chachapoyas, Jaén and Maynas, the latter party previously made up the departments of what is now known as (Department of San Martín, Ucayali, Loreto) being the Intendancy of Trujillo the largest in the Viceroyalty of Peru, that is, almost all of the north of present-day Peru; its first intendant was Fernando Saavedra from 1784 to 1791. He was followed by Vicente Gil de Taboada (1791-1805 and 1810-1820), Felice del Risco y Torres (provisional) (1805-1810) and the Marquis of Torre Tagle (1820), who led the independence of the Intendancy.
===Republican era===
During the Peruvian War of Independence, Chiclayo supported General José de San Martín&#x27;s liberating army with soldiers, weapons, horses, and other resources, under the supervision of the most progressive creole, José Leonardo Ortiz, and Juan Manuel Iturregui, Pascual Saco Oliveros and other Lambayecan patriots.

After independence, Chiclayo was still a small village. On 15 April 1835, Chiclayo was proclaimed a city by then-president Felipe Santiago Salaverry, who declared it a &quot;Heroic City&quot; in recognition of the services its people rendered in the War of Independence. The next day, the Chiclayo Province was organized, with Chiclayo designated as its capital and then, capital of the Department of Lambayeque. In 1827, Chiclayo was elevated to the level of villa. 

===Modern Chiclayo===
Today, Chiclayo is one of the most important Peruvian cities, being one of the financial and commercial capital of Northern Peru. Its strategic geographic location makes it a rail, communications, and automotive hub. Modern touches include large supermarkets, banking chains, warehouses, hospitals, clinics, and galleries. The planned project, Tren de la Costa, is planned to connect the city of Sullana to Ica, which would include Chiclayo as a station. Numerous projects are being planned to improve the city.

Chiclayo is also known as the &quot;City of Friendship&quot; and &quot;Perla del Norte&quot; (&quot;Pearl of the North&quot;) of Perú, for its kind nature of the people.

== Municipal administration ==
In Chiclayo, the mayor is the head of government. The mayor is democratically elected for a period of four years. Each district also has a mayor, under the supervision of the mayor of Chiclayo. They are responsible for coordinating government administrative action in their district. the current mayor of Chiclayo is Janet Cubas Carranza, who was elected in 2023 and replaced Marco Gasco Arrobas. 

=== Districts ===

Central Chiclayo comprises three districts: Chiclayo, José Leonardo Ortiz, and La Victoria. Peripheral to the central city are three other districts: Pimentel, Pomalca, and Reque. Districts are subdivided into housing developments. The total land mass is 252.39 km2.

Adding Pimentel, Pomalca, and Reque to the City of Chiclayo was proposed by a 1992 urban development plan called &quot;Chiclayo 2020&quot;. The program was superseded in 2016 by the Plan de Acondicionamiento Territorial (PAT) and Plan de Desarrollo Urbano (PDU).

=== Metropolitan area ===

Chiclayo is part of the metropolitan area of Chiclayo-Lambayeque. The metropolitan area comprises the six districts of Chiclayo listed above, and six others: Lambayeque, Santa Rosa, Puerto Eten, Eten City, Monsefú, and Reque. Sixty percent of the metropolitan area&#x27;s population is concentrated in the six districts of Chiclayo The metropolitan area comprises central Chiclayo and adjacent areas, including the provincial capital of Lambayeque, some of which serve as bedroom communities and supply goods to Chiclayo.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Chiclayo is located 13 kilometers (8.1 miles) from the Pacific Ocean, 208 kilometers from the city of Trujillo and 770 kilometers (480 miles) from the capital and largest city of Peru, Lima. It is located at an altitude of 27 meters (89 feet) above sea level. Much like Trujillo, Chiclayo has great surfing conditions, with Pimentel being the city&#x27;s most popular beach.

===Climate===

Chiclayo has a warm and very dry desert climate with the sun shining all year around. Since the city of Chiclayo is located in a tropical zone near the Equator, the weather should be hot, humid, and rainy. However, it mostly resembles a subtropical climate, being comfortable and dry. This is due to the strong winds called &quot;cyclones&quot; that lower temperature to a moderate climate for most of the year except in the summer months where the temperature rises, so summer is often spent in resorts like Puerto Eten and Pimentel. In the summer months (December to May) the temperature is hot from 27 °C to 30 °C during the day and between 19 °C to 21 °C at night, reaching peaks of 31 °C to 33 °C during the day and between 22 °C to 23 °C at night between February and March. which makes it an ideal city to spend the summer in its resorts of Puerto Eten and Pimentel; which makes it different from the rest of the central coast of Peru since it has a longer (6 months) and hotter summer with muggy tropical nights and making beach days more pleasant by counteracting the daytime heat the cold water typical of the Peruvian sea. The winter from July to September, therefore, is much milder, cooler and milder than the central coast of the country, with more sunny days and higher daytime temperatures between 21 °C to 24 °C and windy but less humid nights, with almost the complete absence of the typical drizzle or garúa of Trujillo, Chimbote or Lima. Periodically, every 7, 10 or 15 years, there are high temperatures during the summer that can exceed 35 °C due to the El Niño phenomenon, registering regular rains and extreme increase in river water. During the El Niño phenomenon of 1998, in the month of February, 100 mm of rain per day were recorded, caused by the most powerful storms ever recorded in this city. 

==Demographics==

According to the Census of Population and Housing undertaken in 2007, 574,408 people inhabit the area within Chiclayo&#x27;s city limits or the six municipalities. The metropolitan area has a population of 930,824; it includes other nearby cities like Monsefú and Lambayeque in a ten-minute radius by paved highway. Under the thirty-minute range are, in order of hierarchy, Ferreñafe, Santa Rosa, Eten, Illimo and Tuman. Chiclayo is at the center of the Chancay River delta, in a fertile valley. The city is the fourth largest in Peru, after Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo.

According to the planning director of Chiclayo, by 2020 the San Jose district belonging to the Lambayeque Province will be completely integrated with the city of Chiclayo. The district has a population 12,156 inhabitants. Most of the district is conurbanized with the rest of Chiclayo.

Chiclayo, because of its location, serves as a point of interconnection for various cities of the Northeast of the country and has various bus companies which service cities such as Lima, Trujillo, Piura, Cajamarca, Chota, Cutervo, Bagua, Jaén, Chachapoyas, and Tumbes.

To adequately accommodate the transportation demand, the city is served by two different land terminals, one located towards the southern end of the city and another at the northern end on the Panamerican Highway. A substantial number of bus companies have their own terminals, many of them located near the downtown of the city and in nearby areas. These interprovincial buses contribute to the congestion experienced in downtown Chiclayo. To try to solve the problem the city government has proposed a plan to build a central station in the city.

Regionally, there are various different public services such as &quot;combis&quot;, &quot;cousters&quot;, &quot;colectivos&quot;, which provide services within the districts and provinces of the department of Lambayeque.

<text>Gamay () is a purple-colored grape variety used to make red wines, most notably grown in Beaujolais and in the Loire Valley around Tours. Its full name is Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc. It is a very old cultivar, mentioned as long ago as the 15th century. It has been often cultivated because it makes for abundant production; however, it can produce wines of distinction when planted on acidic soils, which help to soften the grape&#x27;s naturally high acidity.

==History==

The Gamay grape is thought to have appeared first in the village of the Gamay, south of Beaune, in the 1360s. The grape brought relief to the village growers following the decline of the Black Death. In contrast to the Pinot noir variety, Gamay ripened two weeks earlier and was easier to cultivate. It also produced a strong, fruitier wine in a much larger abundance.

In July 1395, the Duke of Burgundy Philippe the Bold outlawed the cultivation of the grape, referring to it as the &quot;disloyal Gaamez&quot; that in spite of its ability to grow in abundance was full of &quot;very great and horrible harshness&quot;, due in part to the variety&#x27;s occupation of land that could be used for the more &quot;elegant&quot; Pinot Noir. Sixty years later Philippe the Good issued another edict against Gamay in which he stated the reasoning for the ban is that &quot;The Dukes of Burgundy are known as the lords of the best wines in Christendom. We will maintain our reputation&quot;.

==Characteristics==

Gamay is a very vigorous vine which tends not to root very deeply on alkaline soils resulting in pronounced hydrological stress on the vines over the growing season with a correspondingly high level of acidity in the grapes. The acidity is softened through carbonic maceration, a process that also allows the vibrant youthful fruit expressions reminiscent of bright crushed strawberries and raspberries, as well as deep floral notes of lilac and violets.

Gamay-based wines are typically light bodied and fruity. Wines meant to be drunk after some modest aging tend to have more body and are produced by whole-berry maceration. The latter are produced mostly in the designated &#x27;Cru Beaujolais&#x27; areas where the wines typically have the flavor of sour cherries, black pepper, and dried berry, as well as fresh-cut stone and chalk.

==Regional production==

In addition to being well suited to the terroir of Beaujolais, Gamay is grown extensively in the Loire Valley around Tours, where it is typically blended with Cabernet Franc and Côt, a local clone of Malbec. These wines are similar to those of Crus Beaujolais but with raspberry notes and the signature fresh-peppery nose of the Cabernet Franc.

Gamay is also the grape of the Beaujolais nouveau, produced exclusively from the more alkaline soils of Southern Beaujolais where the grape is incapable of making drinkable wines without aggressive carbonic maceration. The acid levels of the grape grown in the limestone &quot;Pierres Doreés&quot; of the South are too high for making wines with any appeal beyond the early release Nouveaux.

Gamay is commonly grown in the Niagara Peninsula in Canada, some producers being in the Short Hills Bench, Beamsville Bench and St. David&#x27;s Bench, as well as in Prince Edward County and British Columbia. Château des Charmes in Niagara-on-the-Lake has a regional clone which they discovered, Gamay Noir Droit, which is a recognized mutation. 
Gamay is also widely grown in Switzerland in the area of the Lake of Geneva.

It is also grown successfully by a small number of wineries in Australia to make a range of wines including light-bodied red wines suitable for early drinking. 

Gamay has also been introduced into Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley wine region, a place known for its wines made from Pinot noir, another Burgundian grape. It was introduced by Amity Vineyards in 1988. 
In 1991, Rebecca&#x27;s Vineyard planted Gamay and was one of a few Oregon vineyards selling the grapes. LaBete winery was the first to make a vineyard designate of Gamay from Rebecca&#x27;s Vineyard. Since then, Rebecca&#x27;s Vineyard stopped selling Gamay to those who would only blend into their Pinot Noir for flavor and color enhancement, and to only sell to those who would produce stand alone Gamay. Younger wineries like Division Winemaking Co., who are now the largest producer of Gamay in Oregon, have helped raise awareness and availability of the grape in Oregon. Significant new plantings are underway in the Willamette Valley and there&#x27;s even a festival called I Love Gamay held in nearby Portland. 
Tasting notes published by the vineyards at Amity, WillaKenzie, Division, Brickhouse, and Methven describe wines that match the basic profiles of Crus Beaujolais.

==Similarly named grapes and offspring==
The Gamay name has become attached to other varieties grown in California, which at one time were thought to be the true Gamay. The grape &#x27;Napa Gamay&#x27; is now known as Valdiguié, and the name Napa Gamay has not appeared on labels from 2007 onwards. Gamay Beaujolais is considered to be an early ripening Californian clone of Pinot noir. Despite similar names the grapes &quot;Gamay du Rhône&quot; and &quot;Gamay St-Laurent&quot; are not the Beaujolais grape either but rather the southwestern France grape Abouriou.

In 1929, Gamay was crossed with the table grape Seidentraube (also known as &quot;Luglienga bianca&quot;) to produce the white wine grape Regner.

<doc id="555096" wikidata="Q1422786" url="?curid=555096" title="Garganega">
<text>Garganega (, ; meaning &quot;from Gargano&quot;) is a variety of white Italian wine grape widely grown in the Veneto region of North East Italy, particularly in the provinces of Verona and Vicenza. It is Italy&#x27;s 6th most widely planted white grape. It forms the basis of Venetian white wine Soave and is also a major portion of the blend used to make Gambellara.

DNA typing studies in 2003 and 2008 have confirmed that the Grecanico Dorato (Grecanico) grape of Sicily is identical to Garganega. Already before these studies, ampelographers believed the grapes to be related due to the similarities of clusters, berries and leaf characteristics.

==Wine regions==

In the Soave region, Garganega is the primary grape and can compose anywhere from 70 to 100 % of the blend with Trebbiano and Chardonnay being its usual blending partners. In the &quot;Classico&quot; zone of Soave, where yields are most often kept in check, the grape can produce a delicate wine with lemon, almond and spicy notes. In addition to Soave, Garganega is also widely grown in the Gambellara, Bianco di Custoza, Colli Berici and Colli Euganei DOCs. Outside of the Veneto, there are some plantings in the Umbria and Friuli wine regions.

When grown in Sicily under the name Grecanico Dorato, the grapes ripens late and can produce a wine with tangy acidity.

==Viticulture and wines==
The Garganega vine has a tendency to ripen late and can be very vigorous. In the fertile flatlands outside the Soave Classico zone, the grape can produce excessively high yields that lead to very thin and neutral flavored wines. The acid levels in Garganega lends itself well to the production of sweet &quot;recioto&quot; wines that have the potential to improve with bottle age for a decade or more.

==Pedigree==
An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Garganega on the one hand and several other Italian grape varieties on the other hand: Albana, Catarratto, Empibotte, Greco Bianco del Pollino, Malvasia di Candia a Sapore Semplice, Marzemina bianca, Montonico bianco and Trebbiano Toscano (also known as Ugni blanc). It is possible that Garganega is one of the parents of each of these grape varieties. However, since the parents of Garganega have not been identified, the exact nature of the relationship in each case could not be conclusively established. The results were of particular interest, since these seven grape varieties are spread from north to south Italy (and Trebbiano Toscano beyond Italy&#x27;s border), which indicates that Garganega is a key variety in the pedigree of white Italian grape varieties.

==Synonyms==
Garganega is also known under the synonyms D&#x27;Oro, Decanico, Dorana di Venetia, Garganega Comune, Garganega di Gambellara, Garganega Gentile, Garganega Grossa, Garganega Piramidale, Garganega Veronese, Gracanico Dorato, Grecani, Grecanico, Grecanico Bianco, Grecanico Dorato, Grecanicu Biancu, Grecanio, Greccanico, Lizzara, Malvasia de Manresa, Ora, Oro, Ostesa, Ostesona, and Recanicu.

<doc id="555097" wikidata="Q298384" url="?curid=555097" title="Yakov Sverdlov">
<text>Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov ( – 16 March 1919) was a Russian revolutionary and Soviet politician. A key Bolshevik organizer of the October Revolution of 1917, Sverdlov served as chairman of the Secretariat of the Russian Communist Party from 1918 until his death in 1919, and as chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (head of state) from 1917 until his death.

Born in Nizhny Novgorod to a Jewish family active in revolutionary politics, Sverdlov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902 and supported Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik faction from 1903. He was active in the Urals during the failed Revolution of 1905, and over the next decade was subjected to constant imprisonment and exile. After the 1917 February Revolution overthrew the monarchy, Sverdlov returned to Petrograd and was appointed a secretary of the party&#x27;s central committee. In this capacity, he played a key role in planning the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks came to power. Sverdlov became one of most powerful figures in the Soviet regime, with Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin.

In November 1917, Sverdlov was elected chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state. He worked to consolidate Bolshevik control of the new regime and supported the Red Terror campaign and decossackization policies. He played major roles in the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, in persuading party members to support the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed with the Central Powers that March, and in authorising the execution of the Romanov family that July. He also served as the acting chairman of the Soviet government after an assassination attempt on Lenin in 1918.

In March 1919, Sverdlov died at age 33 of the Spanish flu, and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The city of Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) and Theatre Square in Moscow were renamed in his honour. Some historians regard his untimely death as a key factor which enabled the rise of Stalin after Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, as Sverdlov was a natural candidate for the post of General Secretary held by Stalin from 1922.

==Early life==

Sverdlov was born in Nizhny Novgorod as Yakov-Aaron Mikhailovich Sverdlov to Jewish parents, Mikhail Izrailevich Sverdlov and Elizaveta Solomonova. His father was a politically active engraver who produced forged documents and stored arms for the revolutionary underground. The Sverdlov family had six children: two daughters (Sophia and Sara) and four sons (Zinovy, Yakov, Veniamin, and Lev). After his wife&#x27;s death in 1900, Mikhail converted with his family to the Russian Orthodox Church, married Maria Aleksandrovna Kormiltseva, and had two more sons, Herman and Alexander. Sverdlov&#x27;s father was sympathetic to his children&#x27;s socialist tendencies and 5 out of his 6 children would become involved in revolutionary politics at some point. Mikhail watched as his household slowly became a revolutionary hotspot, where the Novgorod Social Democrats would meet, write pamphlets, and even forge stamps for false passports. Yakov&#x27;s eldest brother Zinovy was adopted by Maxim Gorky, who was a frequent guest at the house. Zinovy was the only Sverdlov to reject revolutionary politics and had little to no contact with Yakov after the revolution.

Yakov excelled at school, and after 4 years in gymnasium left to become a pharmacist&#x27;s apprentice and a &quot;professional revolutionary,&quot; Sverdlov joined while a teenager the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902, and then later the Bolshevik faction, supporting Vladimir Lenin. 
In his youth, Sverdlov became friends with a fellow revolutionary Vladimir Lubotsky (later known as Zagorsky). He was involved in the 1905 revolution while living in the Ural Mountains. Though never actually attending college, Sverdlov adopted the garb of the radical students at the time – &quot;With his medium height, unruly brown hair, glasses continually perched on his nose, and Tolstoy shirt worn under his jacket, Sverdlov looked like a student, and for us...a student meant a revolutionary.&quot;

Sverdlov became a major activist and speaker in Nizhny Novgorod. In 1906, Sverdlov was arrested and held in the Yekaterinburg prison until his release. During his time in prison, Sverdlov continued to educate himself and others, reading Lenin, Marx, Kautsky, Heine, and more. Sverdlov attempted to live by the motto: &quot;I put books to the test of life, and life to the test of books.&quot; For most of the time from his arrest in June 1906 until 1917 he was either imprisoned or exiled. In March 1911, Sverdlov was held in the Saint Petersburg House of Pretrial Detention.

During the period 1914–1916 he was in internal exile in Turukhansk, Siberia, along with Joseph Stalin (then known as Dzhugashvili). Both had been betrayed by the Okhrana agent Roman Malinovsky. Of Stalin, Sverdlov wrote &quot;The comrade I was with turned out to be such a person, socially, that we didn&#x27;t talk or see each other. It was terrible.&quot; Sverdlov, like Stalin, was co-opted &quot;in absentia&quot; to the 1912 Prague Conference. In 1914, Sverdlov moved to a different village, moving in with his friend Filipp Goloshchyokin, known as Georges. In early 1917, Sverdlov received news of the Putilov strike of 1917 in Petrograd. Alongside Goloshchyokin, he set out at once, arriving in Petrograd on 29 March 1917.

==Party leader==
After the 1917 February Revolution Sverdlov returned to Petrograd from exile as head of the Urals Delegation and found his way into Lenin&#x27;s inner circle. He first met Lenin in April 1917, and was elected as one of five members of the Central Committee&#x27;s Secretariat in August 1917, after which he usurped Elena Stasova as the body&#x27;s leading figure. In March 1918, he was elected Chairman of the Secretariat. According to Podvoisky, the chairperson of the Military Revolutionary Committee, &quot;The person who did more than anyone to help Lenin with the practicalities of translating convictions into votes was Sverdlov.&quot; As chairman of the Central Committee, Yakov played an important role in planning the October Revolution and helped make the decision to stage an armed uprising. In November as the Bolsheviks debated whether to postpone or hold elections, Sverdlov advocated for immediate elections as promised. When the results came back showing that the Socialist Revolutionaries had won, Sverdlov, Lenin, and Bukharin dissolved the assembly, leading to a civil war.

Sverdlov is sometimes regarded as the first head of state of the Soviet Union, although it was not established until 1922, three years after his death. Sverdlov had a prodigious memory and was able to retain the names and details of fellow revolutionaries in exile. He promoted his friend and suite-mate Varlam Avanesov to second-in-command at the Central Executive Committee, and would later become a top official of the secret police. He also installed Vladimir Volodarsky as commissar of print, propaganda, and agitation until his assassination in 1918. His organizational capability was well-regarded, and during his chairmanship, thousands of local party committees were initiated. One of his comrades recalled that,

[He] could tell you everything you needed to know about a comrade: where he was working, what kind of person he was, what he was good at, and what job he should be assigned to in the interests of the cause and for his benefit. Moreover, Sverdlov had a very precise impression of all the comrades: they were so firmly stamped in his memory that he could tell you all about the company each one kept. It is hard to believe, but true. 

Sverdlov was elected chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in November 1917, of which his wife was also a part, becoming therefore &quot;de jure&quot; head of state of the Russian SFSR until his death. He played important roles in the decision in January 1918 to end the Russian Constituent Assembly and the subsequent signing on 3 March of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In March 1918 Sverdlov along with most prominent Bolsheviks fled Petrograd and moved the government headquarters to Moscow – the Sverdlovs moved into a room in the Kremlin.

In March 1918, Sverdlov and the Central Executive Committee discussed how to best remove the &quot;ulcers that socialism has inherited from capitalism&quot; and Yakov advocated for a concentrated effort to turn the poorest peasants in the villages against their kulak brethren. Alongside Bukharin, the party began a campaign of &quot;concentrated violence&quot; against many members of the landowning, capitalist, and tradesman classes of Russian society.

A number of sources claim that Sverdlov, alongside Lenin and Goloshchyokin, played a major role in the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family on 17 July 1918.

A book written in 1990 by the Moscow playwright Edvard Radzinsky claims that Sverdlov ordered their execution on 16 July 1918. This book and other Radzinsky books were characterized as &quot;folk history&quot; by journalists and academic historians. However Yuri Slezkine in his book &quot;The Jewish Century&quot; expressed a slightly different opinion: &quot;Early in the Civil War, in June 1918, Lenin ordered the killing of Nicholas II and his family. Among the men entrusted with carrying out the orders were Sverdlov, Filipp Goloshchyokin and Yakov Yurovsky&quot;.

The 1922 book by a White Army general, Mikhail Diterikhs, &quot;The Murder of the Tsar&#x27;s Family and members of the House of Romanov in the Urals&quot;, sought to portray the murder of the royal family as a Jewish plot against Russia. It referred to Sverdlov by his Jewish nickname &quot;Yankel&quot; and to Goloshchekin as &quot;Isaac&quot;. This book in turn was based on an account by one Nikolai Sokolov, special investigator for the Omsk regional court, whom Diterikhs assigned with the task of investigating the disappearance of the Romanovs while serving as regional governor under the White regime during the Russian Civil War. The investigating magistrate in Ekaterinburg in 1918 saw the signed telegraphic instructions to execute the Imperial Family came from Sverdlov. These details were published in 1966.

According to Leon Trotsky&#x27;s diaries, after returning from the front (of the Russian Civil War) he had the following dialogue with Sverdlov:

=== Red Terror and decossackization ===
Following the assassination of Moisei Uritsky and the assassination attempt on Lenin in August 1918, Sverdlov drafted a document that called for &quot;merciless mass terror against all the enemies of the revolution.&quot; Under his and Lenin&#x27;s leadership, the Central Executive Committee adopted Sverdlov&#x27;s resolution calling for &quot;mass red terror against the bourgeoisie and its agents.&quot; During Lenin&#x27;s recovery Sverdlov moved into Lenin&#x27;s office in the Kremlin and took over some of Lenin&#x27;s official obligations, including chairing the meetings of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. He oversaw the interrogation of Lenin&#x27;s would-be assassin, Fanny Kaplan, and even moved Kaplan from the Cheka headquarters to be held in a basement room underneath Sverdlov&#x27;s apartment. Sverdlov&#x27;s deputy Avanesov gave the order for Kaplan&#x27;s execution and Sverdlov himself personally ordered that the body be &quot;destroyed without a trace.&quot;

Sverdlov supported the Red Terror campaign, specifically when it came to the policy of decossackization that was started in 1917 as a part of the Russian Civil War. This policy resulted in the deaths of thousands of Cossacks, while the Soviet government confiscated land and food produced by the Cossack population. Sverdlov wrote that &quot;not a single crime against the revolutionary military spirit will remain unpunished,&quot; and that the release of Cossack prisoners was unacceptable. This policy was temporarily suspended in March 1919 while Sverdlov was in Ukraine overseeing the election of the Ukrainian Communist Party&#x27;s central committee.

== Personality ==
For the first 16 months after the Bolshevik revolution, Sverdlov was the third most powerful figure in the Soviet regime, after Lenin and Trotsky. Anatoly Lunacharsky, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Education, wrote that Sverdlov (not Stalin) was the effective leader of the Bolshevik party during the July disturbances in 1917, when Lenin was in hiding and Trotsky and others were under arrest. According to Lunacharsky: &quot;His memory contained something like a biographical dictionary of communism. In every aspect of character which had a bearing on their fitness as revolutionaries Sverdlov could judge people with extraordinary accuracy and finesse.&quot; According to Trotsky, Lenin assumed that if the two of them were killed, it would fall to Sverdlov and Nikolai Bukharin to take over leadership of the communist party. Though the title did not exist at the time, Sverdlov was the &quot;de facto&quot; General Secretary of the Communist Party, the post that Stalin took over three years after Sverdlov&#x27;s death.

Trotsky wrote that:

==Death==

There are various theories on how he died and none can be proven officially such as poisoning, beating or flu. He is most commonly attributed to have died of either typhus or more likely the Spanish flu, after a political visit to Ukraine and Oryol. Kremlin doctors diagnosed him with the Spanish flu. Even as his illness progressed, he continued to perform his duties as chairman of the Central Committee. On 14 March 1919 Sverdlov lost consciousness and on the 16th he died at the age of 33.

He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow. Today his grave is one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin Wall.

He was succeeded in an interim capacity by Mikhail Vladimirsky, and eventually by Mikhail Kalinin as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and by Elena Stasova as Chairwoman of the Secretariat.

== Family ==

Sverdlov was married to a meteorologist, Klavdia Novgorodtseva (1876–1960), who had joined the Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg, her home town, in 1904, and was arrested for organising an illegal printing press. She and Sverdlov met after her release, and worked together during the 1905 revolution. In 1906, she represented the Perm Bolshevik at the Fourth RSDLP Congress in Stockholm. She was arrested again when she returned to Perm, and spent a year in prison. Released in 1910, she joined Sverdlov in St Petersburg, and was arrested again in 1910, but because of her pregnancy was sent back to Yekaterinburg. When she returned illegally to St Petersburg in 1912, she was arrested, held in a cell with her infant son, and deported to Siberia. In 1915 Klavdia joined Yakov in exile in the village of Monastyrskoe, where together they ran a Bolshevik reading circle in the town, which, though illegal, escaped the notice of the local authorities. After the Bolshevik revolution, she worked with Sverdlov in the party secretariat. From 1920 until she retired in 1946, she worked in education, as a specialist in children&#x27;s literature.

Sverdlov and Novgorodtseva had had two children: a son Andrei, who joined the NKVD and became notorious for persecuting other children of eminent Old Bolsheviks, and daughter Vera, born 1915.

Sverdlov&#x27;s brother, Venyamin (1886–1939), emigrated to the US to become a banker, returning to Russia in 1917, where he was appointed head of the Road Research Institute. He was arrested on 13 October 1938, accused of belonging to the counter-revolutionary terrorist organisation, and shot on 16 April 1939.
Sverdlov&#x27;s sister, Sofia (1883–1951), worked as a doctor married a businessman, Leonid Averbakh, and had two children, a son Leopold, who was shot in 1937, and a daughter, Ida, who married Genrikh Yagoda, the future head of the NKVD, and was shot in June 1938. Sofia was arrested in 1937, sentenced to five years exile in Orenburg, then was arrested again and sentenced to eight years in the gulag. She died in a labour camp in Kolyma.

Daniel Swerdlove, the executive producer of the H3 Podcast, is a distant relative of Sverdlov.

==Legacy==

* In a speech on 18 March 1919 Vladimir Lenin praised Sverdlov and his contributions to the revolution. He called Sverdlov &quot;the most perfectly complete type of professional revolutionary.&quot;
* The Central School for Soviet and Party Work, housed in the former Merchants House, Moscow was renamed the Sverdlov Communist University shortly after Sverdlov&#x27;s death.
* The Imperial Russian Navy destroyer leader (commissioned during 1913) was renamed during 1923.
* The first ship of the s was also named after him.
* Yekaterinburg, dubbed the &quot;third capital of Russia&quot;, as it is ranked third by the size of economy, culture, transportation and tourism, was renamed &quot;Sverdlovsk&quot; in 1924 and returned to its former name in 1991.
* In 1938 a number of Ukrainian settlements as well as the Sverdlov mine (part of Sverdlovantratsyt company in 2010s) were merged into the city of Sverdlovsk, which the Ukrainian government renamed Dovzhansk on 12 May 2016, although the renaming could not be enforced due to the Russo-Ukrainian War.
* A few locations in the former Soviet Union still bear Sverdlov&#x27;s name, in the Russian Federation and in Kyrgyzstan. Others have been renamed.

<text>The akçe or akça (also spelled &quot;akche&quot;, &quot;akcheh&quot;; ; , , in Europe known as asper or aspre) was a silver coin which was the chief monetary unit of the Ottoman Empire and was once used by Aq Qoyunlu in the early period. The basic meaning of the word is &quot;silver&quot; or &quot;silver money&quot;, deriving from the Turkish word () and the diminutive suffix . Three s were equal to one . One-hundred and twenty &#x27;s equalled one . Later after 1687 the&#x27; became the main unit of account, replacing the . In 1843, the silver &#x27; was joined by the gold [[Ottoman lira|lira]] in a [[bimetalism|bimetallic]] system. Its weight fluctuated; one source estimates it between 1.15 and 1.18 grams. The name&#x27; originally referred to a silver coin but later the meaning changed and it became a synonym for money.

The mint in Novo Brdo, a fortified mining town in the Serbian Despotate rich with gold and silver mines, began to strike &quot;&quot; in 1441 when it was captured by the Ottoman forces for the first time.

The Suleiman Mosque in Istanbul is said to have cost 59 million &quot;akçe&quot; when it was constructed in the 1550s. This amount is said to have equalled 700,000 ducats in gold (probably Venetian).

<text>Mihailo Dedeić (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Михаило Дедеић; born 8 November 1938) commonly referred to by his birth name Miraš Dedeić (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Мираш Дедеић), was the second head of the non-canonical Montenegrin Orthodox Church.

== Biography ==
He was born in 1938 in the village of Ramovo Ždrijelo on Durmitor. He graduated from the Faculty of Theology in Belgrade in 1969. He completed his postgraduate studies at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome in 1973 and later attended postgraduate studies at the Russian Theological Academy of St. Sergius in Zagorsk.

After finishing his studies he worked in the state archives of SFR Yugoslavia, Soviet Union and Italy in the Roman representation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and later served as a priest of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. His service with the Patriarchate of Constantinople ended in 1997, when Patriarch Bartholomew gave a statement saying that Dedeić had been dismissed for canonical offenses including adultery and embezzlement, that his priestly rank had been revoked, and that he had been reinstated as a layman.

On 6 January 1997 in Cetinje, he was proposed and elected head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. On 31 October 1998 in Cetinje, he was enthroned as Metropolitan of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church.

== Political views ==
At the beginning of Croatian War of Independence Dedeić gave a statement to the Italian media saying that the war started because of the &quot;desire of the Croatian leadership to take over Serbian territories&quot;. He called Dubrovnik a &quot;Serbian city&quot;, while comparing Croatian President Franjo Tuđman to Adolf Hitler.

During the 1992-1995 Bosnian War, Dedeić had been fundraising to support the Army of Republika Srpska under Ratko Mladić&#x27;s command during his plight to support the Serbs fighting the Bosnian Muslims and Croats.

In a Croatian TV show &quot;Bujica&quot;, Dedeić stated that Serbia &quot;committed genocide&quot; in Montenegro in 1918 and 1920 and that Serbs are a &quot;disruptive factor in the Balkans and that they should land a little, because there is no longer Greater Serbia&quot;. He also added that Croatia has the right to form the Croatian Orthodox Church.

<doc id="555118" wikidata="Q1543077" url="?curid=555118" title="Ilmatar">
<text>Ilmatar () is a virgin spirit and goddess of the air in the Finnish national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

==Origins==
The name Ilmatar is derived from the Finnish word &quot;ilma&quot;, meaning &quot;air,&quot; and the female suffix &quot;-tar&quot;, corresponding to the English &quot;-ess&quot;. Thus, her name means &quot;Airess&quot;. In the Kalevala she was also occasionally called Luonnotar (), which means &quot;Naturess,&quot; &quot;female spirit of nature&quot; (Finnish &quot;luonto&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;).

She was impregnated by the sea and wind and thus became the mother of Väinämöinen.

==Sibelius’s &quot;Luonnotar&quot;==
Jean Sibelius composed the Finnish epic tone poem &quot;Luonnotar&quot;, for soprano and orchestra in 1913. In this work, the mythical origin of the land and sky (recounted in verses from the &quot;Kalevala)&quot; becomes an intense Sibelian metaphor for the inexorable force of terror of all creation. Considered to be one of the composer&#x27;s most compelling works, it alternates between two musical themes. As heard at the outset, these are the shimmering stirrings of ever-growing possibility; and, underpinned with dissonant, static, harp strokes, the even more incantatory, distressed cries of the &quot;nature spirit&quot; (&quot;Luonnotar&quot;) herself, heavy with child.

==Homage==
* &quot;Ilmatar&quot; is an album by the Finnish band Värttinä, released in 2000. Its theme was inspired by the goddess&#x27;s origin-story in the &quot;Kalevala&quot; and similar Finnish folk-lore and magic.
* The Main Belt asteroid 385 Ilmatar is named after the goddess.
* In the book &quot;The Quantum Thief&quot;, members of a humanoid race living in the Oort cloud sometimes pray to Kuutar and Ilmatar.
*Tales Eldelórne trilogy by Karleigh Bon, book one, introduces Ilmatar as the &quot;womb of their gods, where immortal elves are reborn&quot;. 2014-2019
* One of the protagonists of the anime &quot;Strike Witches&quot;, Finnish aviator Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen, shares part of her name with that of the goddess.
* Two passenger liners of the now-defunct Finland Steamship Company were named after the goddess: the of 1929 and the of 1964.

<text>In electromagnetism, displacement current density is the quantity appearing in Maxwell&#x27;s equations that is defined in terms of the rate of change of , the electric displacement field. Displacement current density has the same units as electric current density, and it is a source of the magnetic field just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving charges, but a time-varying electric field. In physical materials (as opposed to vacuum), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called dielectric polarization.

The idea was conceived by James Clerk Maxwell in his 1861 paper &quot;On Physical Lines of Force, Part III&quot; in connection with the displacement of electric particles in a dielectric medium. Maxwell added displacement current to the electric current term in Ampère&#x27;s circuital law. In his 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field Maxwell used this amended version of Ampère&#x27;s circuital law to derive the electromagnetic wave equation. This derivation is now generally accepted as a historical landmark in physics by virtue of uniting electricity, magnetism and optics into one single unified theory. The displacement current term is now seen as a crucial addition that completed Maxwell&#x27;s equations and is necessary to explain many phenomena, most particularly the existence of electromagnetic waves.

== Explanation ==

The electric displacement field is defined as:

formula_1

where:
* is the permittivity of free space;
* is the electric field intensity; and
* is the polarization of the medium.

Differentiating this equation with respect to time defines the &quot;displacement current density&quot;, which therefore has two components in a dielectric:(see also the &quot;displacement current&quot; section of the article &quot;current density&quot;)

formula_2

The first term on the right hand side is present in material media and in free space. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily come from any actual movement of charge, but it does have an associated magnetic field, just as a current does due to charge motion. Some authors apply the name &quot;displacement current&quot; to the first term by itself.

The second term on the right hand side, called polarization current density, comes from the change in polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Polarization results when, under the influence of an applied electric field, the charges in molecules have moved from a position of exact cancellation. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate, causing an increase in the state of polarization . A changing state of polarization corresponds to charge movement and so is equivalent to a current, hence the term &quot;polarization current&quot;. Thus,

formula_3

This polarization is the displacement current as it was originally conceived by Maxwell. Maxwell made no special treatment of the vacuum, treating it as a material medium. For Maxwell, the effect of was simply to change the relative permittivity in the relation .

The modern justification of displacement current is explained below.

===Isotropic dielectric case===
In the case of a very simple dielectric material the constitutive relation holds:

formula_4

where the permittivity is the product of:
* , the &quot;permittivity of free space&quot;, or the &quot;electric constant&quot;; and
* , the &quot;relative&quot; permittivity of the dielectric.

In the equation above, the use of accounts for
the polarization (if any) of the dielectric material.

The scalar value of displacement current may also be expressed in terms of electric flux:

formula_5

The forms in terms of scalar are correct only for linear isotropic materials. For linear non-isotropic materials, becomes a matrix; even more generally, may be replaced by a tensor, which may depend upon the electric field itself, or may exhibit frequency dependence (hence dispersion).

For a linear isotropic dielectric, the polarization is given by:

formula_6

where is known as the &quot;susceptibility&quot; of the dielectric to electric fields. Note that

formula_7

==Necessity==
Some implications of the displacement current follow, which agree with experimental observation, and with the requirements of logical consistency for the theory of electromagnetism.

===Generalizing Ampère&#x27;s circuital law===

====Current in capacitors====
An example illustrating the need for the displacement current arises in connection with capacitors with no medium between the plates. Consider the charging capacitor in the figure. The capacitor is in a circuit that causes equal and opposite charges to appear on the left plate and the right plate, charging the capacitor and increasing the electric field between its plates. No actual charge is transported through the vacuum between its plates. Nonetheless, a magnetic field exists between the plates as though a current were present there as well. One explanation is that a &quot;displacement current&quot; &quot;flows&quot; in the vacuum, and this current produces the magnetic field in the region between the plates according to Ampère&#x27;s law:

formula_8

where
* formula_9 is the closed line integral around some closed curve ;
* formula_10 is the magnetic field measured in teslas;
* formula_11 is the vector dot product;
* formula_12 is an infinitesimal vector line element along the curve , that is, a vector with magnitude equal to the length element of , and direction given by the tangent to the curve ;
* formula_13 is the magnetic constant, also called the permeability of free space; and
* formula_14 is the net displacement current that passes through a small surface bounded by the curve .

The magnetic field between the plates is the same as that outside the plates, so the displacement current must be the same as the conduction current in the wires, that is,

formula_15

which extends the notion of current beyond a mere transport of charge.

Next, this displacement current is related to the charging of the capacitor. Consider the current in the imaginary cylindrical surface shown surrounding the left plate. A current, say , passes outward through the left surface of the cylinder, but no conduction current (no transport of real charges) crosses the right surface . Notice that the electric field between the plates increases as the capacitor charges. That is, in a manner described by Gauss&#x27;s law, assuming no dielectric between the plates:

formula_16

where refers to the imaginary cylindrical surface. Assuming a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field, and neglecting fringing effects around the edges of the plates, according to charge conservation equation

formula_17

where the first term has a negative sign because charge leaves surface (the charge is decreasing), the last term has a positive sign because unit vector of surface is from left to right while the direction of electric field is from right to left, is the area of the surface . The electric field at surface is zero because surface is in the outside of the capacitor. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field distribution inside the capacitor, the displacement current density D is found by dividing by the area of the surface:

formula_18

where &#x27; is the current leaving the cylindrical surface (which must equal &#x27;D) and D is the flow of charge per unit area into the cylindrical surface through the face .

Combining these results, the magnetic field is found using the integral form of Ampère&#x27;s law with an arbitrary choice of contour provided the displacement current density term is added to the conduction current density (the Ampère-Maxwell equation):

formula_19

This equation says that the integral of the magnetic field around the edge of a surface is equal to the integrated current through any surface with the same edge, plus the displacement current term through whichever surface. 

As depicted in the figure to the right, the current crossing surface is entirely conduction current. Applying the Ampère-Maxwell equation to surface yields:

formula_20

However, the current crossing surface is entirely displacement current. Applying this law to surface , which is bounded by exactly the same curve , but lies between the plates, produces:

formula_21

Any surface that intersects the wire has current passing through it so Ampère&#x27;s law gives the correct magnetic field. However a second surface bounded by the same edge could be drawn passing between the capacitor plates, therefore having no current passing through it. Without the displacement current term Ampere&#x27;s law would give zero magnetic field for this surface. Therefore, without the displacement current term Ampere&#x27;s law gives inconsistent results, the magnetic field would depend on the surface chosen for integration. Thus the displacement current term is necessary as a second source term which gives the correct magnetic field when the surface of integration passes between the capacitor plates. Because the current is increasing the charge on the capacitor&#x27;s plates, the electric field between the plates is increasing, and the rate of change of electric field gives the correct value for the field found above.

====Mathematical formulation====
In a more mathematical vein, the same results can be obtained from the underlying differential equations. Consider for simplicity a non-magnetic medium where the relative magnetic permeability is unity, and the complication of magnetization current (bound current) is absent, so that formula_22 and 
The current leaving a volume must equal the rate of decrease of charge in a volume. In differential form this continuity equation becomes:

formula_23

where the left side is the divergence of the free current density and the right side is the rate of decrease of the free charge density. However, Ampère&#x27;s law in its original form states:

formula_24

which implies that the divergence of the current term vanishes, contradicting the continuity equation. (Vanishing of the &quot;divergence&quot; is a result of the mathematical identity that states the divergence of a &quot;curl&quot; is always zero.) This conflict is removed by addition of the displacement current, as then:

formula_25

and

formula_26

which is in agreement with the continuity equation because of Gauss&#x27;s law:

formula_27

===Wave propagation===
The added displacement current also leads to wave propagation by taking the curl of the equation for magnetic field.

formula_28

Substituting this form for into Ampère&#x27;s law, and assuming there is no bound or free current density contributing to :

formula_29

with the result:

formula_30

However,
formula_31

leading to the wave equation:
formula_32

where use is made of the vector identity that holds for any vector field :

formula_33

and the fact that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. An identical wave equation can be found for the electric field by taking the &quot;curl&quot;:

formula_34

If , , and are zero, the result is:

formula_35

The electric field can be expressed in the general form:

formula_36

where is the electric potential (which can be chosen to satisfy Poisson&#x27;s equation) and is a vector potential (i.e. magnetic vector potential, not to be confused with surface area, as is denoted elsewhere). The component on the right hand side is the Gauss&#x27;s law component, and this is the component that is relevant to the conservation of charge argument above. The second term on the right-hand side is the one relevant to the electromagnetic wave equation, because it is the term that contributes to the curl of . Because of the vector identity that says the curl of a gradient is zero, does not contribute to .

== History and interpretation ==

Maxwell&#x27;s displacement current was postulated in part III of his 1861 paper &#x27;&#x27;. Few topics in modern physics have caused as much confusion and misunderstanding as that of displacement current. This is in part due to the fact that Maxwell used a sea of molecular vortices in his derivation, while modern textbooks operate on the basis that displacement current can exist in free space. Maxwell&#x27;s derivation is unrelated to the modern day derivation for displacement current in the vacuum, which is based on consistency between Ampère&#x27;s circuital law for the magnetic field and the continuity equation for electric charge.

Maxwell&#x27;s purpose is stated by him at (Part I, p. 161):

He is careful to point out the treatment is one of analogy:

In part III, in relation to displacement current, he says

Clearly Maxwell was driving at magnetization even though the same introduction clearly talks about dielectric polarization.

Maxwell compared the speed of electricity measured by Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch (193,088 miles/second) and the speed of light determined by the Fizeau experiment (195,647 miles/second). Based on their same speed, he concluded that &quot;light consists of transverse undulations in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.&quot;

But although the above quotations point towards a magnetic explanation for displacement current, for example, based upon the divergence of the above curl equation, Maxwell&#x27;s explanation ultimately stressed linear polarization of dielectrics:

With some change of symbols (and units) combined with the results deduced in the section (, , and the material constant these equations take the familiar form between a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field, and neglecting fringing effects around the edges of the plates:

formula_37

When it came to deriving the electromagnetic wave equation from displacement current in his 1865 paper &#x27;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field&#x27;, he got around the problem of the non-zero divergence associated with Gauss&#x27;s law and dielectric displacement by eliminating the Gauss term and deriving the wave equation exclusively for the solenoidal magnetic field vector.

Maxwell&#x27;s emphasis on polarization diverted attention towards the electric capacitor circuit, and led to the common belief that Maxwell conceived of displacement current so as to maintain conservation of charge in an electric capacitor circuit. There are a variety of debatable notions about Maxwell&#x27;s thinking, ranging from his supposed desire to perfect the symmetry of the field equations to the desire to achieve compatibility with the continuity equation.

<text>Pierre Berthier (; 3 July 1782, Nemours, Seine-et-Marne – 24 August 1861) was a French geologist and mining engineer.

Pierre Berthier was born in Nemours. After studying at the École Polytechnique, he went to the École des Mines, where he became chief of the laboratory in 1816. In 1821, while working in the village of Les Baux-de-Provence, in southern France, he discovered the rock bauxite, named for the place of its discovery. He also discovered the mineral Berthierite, which was named after him. In addition to numerous contributions in mineralogy and mining, Berthier is also noted for his research into blast furnaces and for the utilization of phosphates by plants.

He was paralyzed by an accident in 1858.
The detailed register of homosexuals, then maintained by the Paris police prefecture, mention him as a lover of soldiers.

==Awards==
Pierre Berthier was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1825. In 1828, he became a &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Legion of Honor. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="555126" wikidata="Q451935" url="?curid=555126" title="Magic (cryptography)">
<text>Magic was an Allied cryptanalysis project during World War II. It involved the United States Army&#x27;s Signals Intelligence Service (SIS) and the United States Navy&#x27;s Communication Special Unit.

==Codebreaking==
Magic was set up to combine the US government&#x27;s cryptologic capabilities in one organization dubbed the Research Bureau. Intelligence officers from the Army and Navy (and later civilian experts and technicians) were all under one roof. Although they worked on a series of codes and cyphers, their most important successes involved RED, BLUE, and PURPLE.

===RED===
In 1923, a US Navy officer acquired a stolen copy of the Secret Operating Code codebook used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I. Photographs of the codebook were given to the cryptanalysts at the Research Desk and the processed code was kept in red-colored folders (to indicate its Top Secret classification). This code was called &quot;RED&quot;.

===BLUE===
In 1930, the Japanese government created a more complex code that was codenamed BLUE, although RED was still being used for low-level communications. It was quickly broken by the Research Desk no later than 1932. US Military Intelligence COMINT listening stations began monitoring command-to-fleet, ship-to-ship, and land-based communications.

===PURPLE===

After Japan&#x27;s ally Germany declared war in the fall of 1939, the German government began sending technical assistance to upgrade their communications and cryptography capabilities. One part was to send them modified Enigma machines to secure Japan&#x27;s high-level communications with Germany. The new code, codenamed PURPLE (from the color obtained by mixing red and blue), was baffling.

PURPLE, like Enigma, began its communications with the same line of code but then became an unfathomable jumble. Codebreakers tried to break PURPLE communiques by hand but found they could not. Then the codebreakers realized that it was not a manual additive or substitution code like RED and BLUE, but a machine-generated code similar to Germany&#x27;s Enigma cipher. Decoding was slow and much of the traffic was still hard to break. By the time the traffic was decoded and translated, the contents were often out of date.

A reverse-engineered machine created in 1939 by a team of technicians led by William Friedman and Frank Rowlett could decrypt some of the PURPLE code by replicating some of the settings of the Japanese Enigma machines. This accelerated decoding and the addition of more translators on staff in 1942 made it easier and quicker to decipher the traffic intercepted.

==PURPLE traffic==
The Japanese Foreign Office used a cipher machine to encrypt its diplomatic messages. The machine was called &quot;PURPLE&quot; by U.S. cryptographers. A message was typed into the machine, which enciphered and sent it to an identical machine. The receiving machine could decipher the message only if set to the correct settings, or keys. American cryptographers built a machine that could decrypt these messages.

The PURPLE machine itself was first used by Japan in 1940. U.S. and British cryptographers had broken some PURPLE traffic well before the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, the PURPLE machines were used only by the Foreign Office to carry diplomatic traffic to its embassies. The Japanese Navy used a completely different crypto-system, known as JN-25.

U.S. analysts discovered no hint in PURPLE of the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Nor could they, as the Japanese were very careful not to discuss their plan in Foreign Office communications. No detailed information about the planned attack was even available to the Japanese Foreign Office, as that agency was regarded by the military, particularly its more nationalist members, as insufficiently &quot;reliable&quot;. 

U.S. access to private Japanese diplomatic communications (even the most secret ones) was less useful than it might otherwise have been because policy in prewar Japan was controlled largely by military groups like the Imperial Way Faction, and not by the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office itself deliberately withheld from its embassies and consulates much of the information it did have, so the ability to read PURPLE messages was less than definitive regarding Japanese tactical or strategic military intentions.

U.S. cryptographers (see Station HYPO) had decrypted and translated the 14-part Japanese diplomatic message breaking off ongoing negotiations with the U.S. at 1 p.m. Washington time on 7 December 1941, even before the Japanese Embassy in Washington could do so. As a result of the deciphering and typing difficulties at the embassy, the note was delivered late to American Secretary of State Cordell Hull. When the two Japanese diplomats finally delivered the note, Hull had to pretend to be reading it for the first time, even though he already knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Throughout the war, the Allies routinely read both German and Japanese cryptography. The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Hiroshi Ōshima, often sent priceless German military information to Tokyo. This information was routinely intercepted and read by Roosevelt, Churchill and Eisenhower. According to Lowman, &quot;The Japanese considered the PURPLE system absolutely unbreakable… Most went to their graves refusing to believe the [cipher] had been broken by analytic means… They believed someone had betrayed their system.&quot;

==Distribution prior to Pearl Harbor==
Even so, the diplomatic information was of limited value to the U.S. because of its manner and its description. &quot;Magic&quot; was distributed in such a way that many policy-makers who had need of the information in it knew nothing of it, and those to whom it actually was distributed (at least before Pearl Harbor) saw each message only briefly, as the courier stood by to take it back, and in isolation from other messages (no copies or notes being permitted). Before Pearl Harbor, they saw only those decrypts thought &quot;important enough&quot; by the distributing Army or Navy officers. 

Nonetheless, being able to read PURPLE messages gave the Allies a great advantage in the war. For instance, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Baron Hiroshi Ōshima, produced long reports for Tokyo which were enciphered on the PURPLE machine. They included reports on personal discussions with Adolf Hitler and a report on a tour of the invasion defenses in Northern France (including the D-Day invasion beaches). General Marshall said that Ōshima was &quot;our main basis of... information regarding Hitler&#x27;s intentions in Europe&quot;.

==Dewey and Marshall==
During the 1944 election, Thomas Dewey threatened to make Pearl Harbor a campaign issue, until General Marshall sent him a personal letter which said, in part:

:To explain the critical nature of this set-up, which would be wiped out in an instant if the least suspicion were aroused regarding it, the Battle of Coral Sea was based on deciphered messages and therefore our few ships were in the right place at the right time. Further, we were able to concentrate our limited forces to meet their naval advance on Midway when otherwise we almost certainly would have been some out of place. We had full information on the strength of their forces.

Dewey promised not to raise the issue, and kept his word.

==Post-war debates==
The break into the PURPLE system, and into Japanese messages generally, was the subject of acrimonious hearings in Congress post-World War II in connection with an attempt to decide who, if anyone, had allowed the disaster at Pearl Harbor to happen and who therefore should be blamed. During those hearings the Japanese learned, for the first time, the PURPLE cypher system had been broken. They had been continuing to use it, even after the War, with the encouragement of the American Occupation Government. 

Much confusion over who in Washington or Hawaii knew what and when, especially as &quot;we were decrypting their messages,&quot; has led some to conclude &quot;someone in Washington&quot; knew about the Pearl Harbor attack before it happened, and, since Pearl Harbor was not expecting to be attacked, the &quot;failure to warn Hawaii one was coming must have been deliberate, since it could hardly have been mere oversight&quot;. However, PURPLE was a diplomatic, not a military code. Thus, only inferences could be drawn from PURPLE as to specific Japanese military actions.

==History==
When PURPLE was broken by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Signals Intelligence Service (SIS), several problems arose for the Americans: who would get the decrypts, which decrypts, how often, under what circumstances, and crucially (given interservice rivalries) who would do the delivering. Both the U.S. Navy and Army were insistent they alone handle all decrypted traffic delivery, especially to highly placed policy makers in the U.S. Eventually, after much to-ing and fro-ing, a compromise was reached: the Army would be responsible for the decrypts on one day, and the Navy the next.

The distribution list eventually included some—but not all—military intelligence leaders in Washington and elsewhere, and some—but, again, not all—civilian policy leaders in Washington. The eventual routine for distribution included the following steps:
* the duty officer (Army or Navy, depending on the day) would decide which decrypts were significant or interesting enough to distribute
* they would be collected, locked into a briefcase, and turned over to a relatively junior officer (not always cleared to read the decrypts) who would &#x27;make the rounds&#x27; to the appropriate offices.
* no copies of any decrypts were left with anyone on the list. The recipient would be allowed to read the translated decrypt, in the presence of the distributing officer, and was required to return it immediately upon finishing. Before the beginning of the second week in December 1941, that was the last time anyone on the list saw that particular decrypt.

==Decryption process==
There were several prior steps needed before any decrypt was ready for distribution:
# &quot;Interception&quot;. The Japanese Foreign Office used both wireless transmission and cables to communicate with its off shore units. Wireless transmission was intercepted (if possible) at any of several listening stations (Hawaii, Guam, Bainbridge Island in Washington state, Dutch Harbor on an Alaska island, etc.) and the raw cypher groups were forwarded to Washington, D.C. Eventually, there were decryption stations (including a copy of the Army&#x27;s PURPLE machine) in the Philippines as well. Cable traffic was (for many years before late 1941) collected at cable company offices by a military officer who made copies and started them to Washington. Cable traffic in Hawaii was not intercepted due to legal concerns until David Sarnoff of RCA agreed to allow it during a visit to Hawaii the first week of December 1941. At one point, intercepts were being mailed to (Army or Navy) Intelligence from the field.
# &quot;Deciphering&quot;. The raw intercept was deciphered by either the Army or the Navy (depending on the day). Deciphering was usually successful as the cipher had been broken.
# &quot;Translation&quot;. Having obtained the plain text, in Latin letters, it was translated. Because the Navy had more Japanese-speaking officers, much of the burden of translation fell onto the Navy. And because Japanese is a difficult language, with meaning highly dependent upon context, effective translation required not only fluent Japanese, but considerable knowledge of the context within which the message was sent.
# &quot;Evaluation&quot;. The translated decrypt had to be evaluated for its intelligence content. For example, is the ostensible content of the message meaningful? If it is, for instance, part of a power contest within the Foreign Office or some other part of the Japanese government, its meaning and implications would be quite different from a simple informational or instructional message to an embassy. Or, might it be another message in a series whose meaning, taken together, is more than the meaning of any individual message. Thus, the fourteenth message to an embassy instructing that embassy to instruct Japanese merchant ships calling at that country to return to home waters before, say, the end of November would be more significant than a single such message meant for a single ship or port. Only after having evaluated a translated decrypt for its intelligence value could anyone decide whether it deserved to be distributed.

In the period before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the material was handled awkwardly and inefficiently, and was distributed even more awkwardly. Nevertheless, the extraordinary experience of reading a foreign government&#x27;s most closely held communications, sometimes even before the intended recipient, was astonishing. It was so astonishing, someone (possibly President Roosevelt) called it magic. The name stuck.

==Executive Order 9066==
One aspect of Magic remains controversial to this day—the amount of involvement the intercepts played in the issuing of United States Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, and subsequent Executive Order 9102 on March 18, which led to the creation of the Wartime Relocation Authority (WRA). This is often confused with the issue of internment, which was actually handled by the Justice Department&#x27;s Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and affected all citizens of countries at war with the United States in any location.

Internment of &quot;enemy aliens&quot; by the U.S. government began two months prior to Executive Order 9066 on December 8, 1941, immediately after the attack at Pearl Harbor and included Germans and Italians, and not just the Japanese living on the U.S. West Coast.

David Lowman in his book &quot;MAGIC: the Untold Story&quot; reports that the primary justification for the Japanese-American relocations and internments was to protect against espionage and sabotage, because Magic could not be mentioned during the war. Those defending the decision to evacuate and relocate when seen in context, notably blogger and investigative reporter Michelle Malkin, point to Magic intercepts as partial justification for EO 9066. Malkin cites 1984 testimony of the Undersecretary with the most Magic knowledge, who stated that Magic &quot;was a very important factor&quot; in their considerations. 

Extensive additional primary source documents are cited in Malkin&#x27;s book &quot;In Defense of Internment&quot; to argue that Magic intercepts discuss the development of a spy ring among Japanese Americans by the Japanese consulates, provide the type of espionage data being sent to Japan, and much more which raised a suspicion that many thousands in the Japanese American community were an espionage risk, including members of Kibei, Issei and Nisei.

In 1988, Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed legislation that apologized for the internment on behalf of the U.S. government. The legislation said that government actions were based on &quot;race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership&quot;. The hearings that produced this decision did not take into account the Magic intercepts.

The following is the actual text of several Magic intercepts translated into English before and during the war and declassified and made public in 1978 by the U.S. government (&quot;The Magic Background of Pearl Harbor&quot;, Government Printing Office, 8 volumes)

===Tokyo to Washington===
;Magic intercept Tokyo to Washington #44 – Jan 30, 1941

Intercept dated January 30, 1941 and noted as translated 2-7-41
Numbered #44

===Japanese U.S. consulates to Tokyo===
Throughout the rest of 1941, some of the messages between Tokyo and its embassies and consulates continued to be intercepted.

In response to the ordered shift from propaganda efforts to espionage collection, the Japanese consulates throughout the western hemisphere reported their information normally through the use of diplomatic channels, but when time-sensitive through the use of PURPLE encoded messages. This provided vital clues to their progress directly to the U.S. President and his top advisers.

Intercepts in May 1941 from the consulates in Los Angeles and Seattle report that the Japanese were having success in obtaining information and cooperation from &quot;second generation&quot; Japanese Americans and others.

;Magic intercept LA to Tokyo #067 – May 9, 1941

Intercept dated May 9, 1941 and translated 5-19-41
Numbered #067

;Magic intercept Seattle to Tokyo #45 – May 11, 1941

Intercept dated May 11, 1941 and translated 6-9-41
Numbered # 45

===Access by Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet===
These intercepts plus other reports from the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence counter-espionage efforts, the TACHIBANA espionage case during summer 1941, FBI efforts against Japanese yakuza throughout the 1930s along the West Coast (the TOKOYO and TOYO CLUBs) were all available only to the most senior leaders in the Roosevelt cabinet. Even J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, was not privy to the existence of Magic intelligence.

===Opposing viewpoint===
Those who consider that Executive Order 9066 regarding Japanese American internment was not based on Magic intercepts, argue:
* the commanding officer on the West coast, Lt. Gen. J. L. DeWitt, was not on the Magic intercept list,
* his superior, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, was on the intercept list, and
* Stimson requested justification for the relocation program from DeWitt.
* If Magic intercepts provided justification, why ask DeWitt for further justification?

One theory is that Stimson wanted DeWitt to provide justifications that could be made public, because the Magic intercepts could not be made public.

The issue was inflamed due to the release of Malkin&#x27;s 2004 book, &quot;In Defense of Internment&quot;, in which the Magic intercepts play a major role in the defense of her thesis.

==Other Japanese ciphers==
PURPLE was an enticing, but quite tactically limited, window into Japanese planning and policy because of the peculiar nature of Japanese policy making prior to the War (see above). Early on, a better tactical window was the Japanese Fleet Code (an encoded cypher), called JN-25 by U.S. Navy cryptanalysts. Breaking into the version in use in the months after December 7, 1941 provided enough information to lead to U.S. naval victories in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, stopping the initial Japanese advances to the south and eliminating the bulk of Japanese naval air power. 

Later, broken JN-25 traffic provided the schedule and routing of the plane Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto would be flying in during an inspection tour in the southwest Pacific, giving USAAF pilots a chance to ambush the officer who had conceived the Pearl Harbor attack. Later still, access to Japanese Army messages from decrypts of Army communications traffic assisted in planning the island hopping campaign to the Philippines and beyond.

Another source of information was the Japanese Military Attaché code (known as JMA to the Allies) introduced in 1941. This was a fractionating transposition system based on two-letter code groups which stood for common words and phrases. The groups were written in a square grid according to an irregular pattern and read off vertically, similar to a disrupted columnar transposition. Then the letters were superenciphered using a pre-arranged table of alphabets. This system was broken by John Tiltman at Bletchley Park in 1942.

==Other claimed breaks into PURPLE==
The 1992 book &quot;The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB&quot;, by Christopher Andrew, based on the Mitrokhin Archive smuggled out of Russia in the early 1990s by a KGB archivist, contains information about wartime Soviet knowledge of Japanese enciphered transmissions. It claims that the Soviets independently broke into Japanese PURPLE traffic (as well as the Red predecessor machine). 

It claims that decrypted PURPLE messages contributed to the decision by Stalin to move troops from Far Eastern Asia to the area around Moscow for the counterattack against Germany in December 1941, as the messages convinced the Soviet government that there would not be a Japanese attack.

==How secret was Magic?==
Public notice had actually been served that Japanese cryptography was dangerously inadequate by the Chicago Tribune, which published a series of stories just after Midway, starting on 7 June 1942, which claimed (correctly) that victory was due in large part to the U.S. breaking into Japanese crypto systems (in this case, the JN-25 cypher, though which system(s) had been broken was not mentioned in the newspaper stories). The &quot;Tribune&quot; claimed the story was written by Stanley Johnston from his own knowledge (and &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot;).

Ronald Lewin points out that the story repeats the layout and errors of a signal from Admiral Nimitz which Johnston saw while on the transport &quot;Barnett&quot;. Nimitz was reprimanded by Admiral King for sending the dispatch to Task Force commanders on a channel available to nearly all ships. The &quot;Lexington&#x27;s&quot; executive officer, Commander Morton T. Seligman was assigned to shore duty and retired early.

However, neither the Japanese nor anyone who might have told them seem to have noticed either the Tribune coverage, or the stories based on the Tribune account published in other U.S. papers. Nor did they notice announcements made on the floor of the United States Congress to the same effect. There were no changes in Japanese cryptography connected with those newspaper accounts or Congressional disclosures.

Alvin Kernan was an aviation ordnanceman on board the aircraft carriers and the during the war. During that time, he was awarded the Navy Cross. In his book &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;, he states that when the carrier returned to Pearl Harbor to resupply before the Battle of Midway, the crew knew that the Japanese code had been broken and that U.S. naval forces were preparing to engage the Japanese fleet at Midway. He insists that he &quot;…exactly remembers the occasion on which I was told, with full details about ships and dates…&quot; despite the later insistence that the breaking of the code was kept secret.

U.S. Navy Commander I.J. Galantin, who retired as an Admiral, refers several times to Magic in his 1988 book about his Pacific theater war patrols as captain of the U.S. submarine . However, Galantin refers to Magic as &quot;Ultra&quot; which was actually the name given to the breaking of the German code. Upon receiving one message from Pacific Fleet command, directing him off normal station to intercept Japanese vessels due to a Magic message, Galantin writes. &quot;I had written my night orders carefully. I made no reference to Ultra and stressed only the need to be very alert for targets in this fruitful area&quot;. Galantin had previously mentioned in his book that all submarine captains were aware of &quot;Ultra&quot; (Magic).

In addition, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall discovered early in the war that Magic documents were being widely read at the White House, and that &quot;…at one time over 500 people were reading messages we had intercepted from the Japanese… Everyone seemed to be reading them&quot; .

==Fiction==
Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; includes a fictionalized version of Magic, with the Japanese cryptosystem being named &quot;Indigo&quot; rather than &quot;PURPLE&quot;.

James Bond is given the products of the fictionalized &quot;MAGIC 44&quot; decryption programme in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; as a bargaining chip when he is deployed to negotiate for intelligence concessions from Tiger Tanaka, head of Japanese intelligence.

The W.E.B. Griffin series &quot;The Corps&quot; is a fictionalized account of United States Navy and Marine Corps intelligence operations in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Many of the main characters in the novels, both fictional and historical, have access to and use intelligence from Magic.

<doc id="555128" wikidata="Q202135" url="?curid=555128" title="Book of Wisdom">
<text>The Book of Wisdom, or the Wisdom of [[Solomon]], is a book written in Greek and most likely composed in Alexandria, Egypt. It is not part of the Hebrew Bible but is included in the Septuagint. Generally dated to the mid-first century BC, or to the reign of Caligula (AD 37–41), the central theme of the work is &quot;wisdom&quot; itself, appearing under two principal aspects. The first aspect is, in its relation to mankind, wisdom is the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. The second aspect is, in direct relation to God, wisdom is with God from all eternity. It is one of the seven sapiential or wisdom books in the Septuagint, the others being Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs (Song of Solomon), Job, and Sirach. It is one of the deuterocanonical books, i.e. it is included in the canons of the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, but most Protestants consider it part of the Apocrypha.

==Structure, genre and content==
The 19 chapters of the work can be grouped into three sections. Lester Grabbe organises these as follows:
# Book of Eschatology
#* exhortation to justice
#* speech of the impious, contrasts of the wicked and the just
#* exhortation to wisdom
# Book of Wisdom
#* Solomon&#x27;s speech concerning wisdom, wealth, power and prayer
# Book of History
#* introduction, followed by diptychs of plagues
#* digression on God&#x27;s power and mercy
#* digression on false worship and further plagues
#* recapitulation and concluding doxology.

The book is addressed to the rulers of the earth (verse 1:1), urging them to love righteousness and seek wisdom; the wicked think that all is chance and that they should enjoy each day, but they are deluded. In the second section Solomon (not explicitly named, but strongly implied) tells of his search for wisdom.

The Wisdom of Solomon can be linked to several forms of ancient literature, both Jewish and non-Jewish, but it clearly belongs with biblical Wisdom books such as the Book of Job, one of only five such books among ancient Jewish literature. In terms of classical genre it has been identified as an encomium and with the Greek genre of the &quot;exhortatory discourse&quot;, by which a teacher attempts to persuade others to a certain course of action.

==Canonicity==

Origen in the 2nd century AD refers to uncertainty about the Book of Wisdom. Melito of Sardis (possibly) in the 2nd century AD, Augustine () and Pope Innocent I (405) considered Wisdom of Solomon as part of the Old Testament. Athanasius writes that the Book of Wisdom along with three other deuterocanonical books, while not being part of the Canon, &quot;were appointed by the Fathers to be read&quot;. Epiphanius of Salamis () mentions that the Wisdom of Solomon was of disputed canonicity. According to the monk Rufinus of Aquileia () the Book of Wisdom was categorized as &quot;ecclesiastical&quot; rather than &quot;canonical&quot;.

The Book of Wisdom was listed as canonical by the Council of Rome (AD 382), the Synod of Hippo (393), the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), the Quinisext Council (692), the Council of Florence (in 1442) and the Council of Trent (in 1546).

According to John of Damascus in his &quot;Exposition of the Orthodox Faith&quot; (c. 730) the Book of Wisdom is not in the ark: &quot;There are also the Panaretus, that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Jesus, which was published in Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards translated into Greek by his grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach. These are virtuous and noble, but are not counted nor were they placed in the ark.&quot;

==Composition==
There is a general consensus among scholars (with only a few dissenting voices) that the Wisdom of Solomon was written in Greek, in Alexandria (Egypt), around the turn of the era - late first century BC. to early first century AD. Alexandria is where the Greek Bible was translated and put together. What is known of the Jewish community there accords with what can be deduced from the text about the audience for which it was written. It shares an outlook similar to that of other texts such as 4 Maccabees, Letter of Aristeas, and the works of Philo, which all came from this community. One specific indication of Egyptian origin is the author&#x27;s use of Egyptian imagery of the goddess Isis to describe personified Wisdom as a divine female figure. Another is the very clear interest in Egypt revealed in the third section of the book (chs. 10-19). Ch. 10 begins a review of Israel&#x27;s history but never gets beyond the exodus story, where the text indulges in a sharp polemic against idolatry in its particular Egyptian manifestation, that is, the animal cult (see 12:24; 15:18-19). There are no clear allusions to contemporary historical events in the book, so one can suggest only an approximate date for it. Since the author quotes from most parts of the LXX version of the OT, he cannot have been writing much before the middle of the second century BC.

Winston 1979: 20-25 argues that the earliest date for the book can be more precisely fixed as sometime after the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC on the grounds that 14:16-20 is an allusion to the emperor cult begun under Augustus. He confirms this conclusion by an analysis of the thirty-five Greek words in the Wisdom of Solomon which are not attested in other Greek literature before the first century AD. Larcher 1983: 1:141-61 argues that the book was composed over a period of time between 31 and 10 BC. The latest possible date for the work is more difficult to fix than the earliest. Most scholars feel that Wisdom predates Philo and was also used by some NT authors, particularly Paul and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. This would make it no later than the early first century AD. Winston dates it precisely to the reign of Caligula (AD 37-41) when the Alexandrian Jewish community underwent a particularly severe crisis which he feels is reflected in the harsh anti-Gentile tone of the book. Larcher is not convinced of this later dating. It is safest to say that the Wisdom of Solomon was probably written about thirty years either side of the turn of the era.

The author&#x27;s prime literary source was the Septuagint, in particular the Wisdom literature and the Book of Isaiah, and he was familiar with late Jewish works as the Book of Enoch and with Greek philosophical literature. It is uncertain whether the book has a single author or comes from a school of writers, it is said to be &quot;written by the friends of Solomon in his honour&quot; in the Muratorian Fragment, but recent scholarship has favoured regarding it as a unified work. In either case its blend of Greek and Jewish features suggests a learned Hellenistic background, and despite the address to the &quot;rulers of the world&quot; the actual audience was probably members of the author&#x27;s own community who were tempted to give up their Jewishness in the face of the temptations of Greek culture and the hostile conditions facing Jews in the Greek world.

==Themes==
The book opens with the opposed pairs righteousness/unrighteousness and death/immortality: those who do not follow righteousness will fall into &quot;senseless reasoning&quot; and will not be open to wisdom; wisdom is not an inherent human quality nor one that can be taught, but comes from outside, and only to those who are prepared through righteousness. The suffering of the righteous will be rewarded with immortality, while the wicked will end miserably. The unrighteous are doomed because they do not know God&#x27;s purpose, but the righteous will judge the unrighteous in God&#x27;s presence. Lady Wisdom, first referred to as &quot;she&quot; in Wisdom 6:12, dominates the middle section of the book (chapters 6-9), in which Solomon speaks. She existed from the Creation, and God is her source and guide. She is to be loved and desired, and kings seek her: Solomon himself preferred wisdom to wealth, health, and all other things. She in turn has always come to the aid of the righteous, from Adam to the Exodus. The final section, chapters 10-19, takes up the theme of the rescue of the righteous, taking the Exodus as its focus: &quot;You (God) have not neglected to help (your people the Jews) at all times and in all places.&quot; (Wisdom 19:22).

==Influence==
Nineteenth-century American author Herman Melville marked his copy of the Wisdom of Solomon heavily. Without knowledge of biblical criticism, he managed to note the interplay of Hellenistic Platonism and Jewish philosophy, writing, &quot;this admirable book seems partly Mosaic &amp; partly Platonic in its tone. Who wrote it I know not. Someone to whom both Plato and Moses stood for godfather.&quot; The interplay of multiple philosophies is exemplified in many of Melville&#x27;s works, specifically &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and &quot;Clarel&quot;, wherein religious and philosophical interplay represent the struggle for certainty in the 19th century.

A considerable portion of the Wisdom of Solomon, starting with Chapter II, was read at a memorial service in Concord, Massachusetts, on December 2, 1859, the day of the execution of the abolitionist John Brown.

<doc id="555130" wikidata="Q6842877" url="?curid=555130" title="Midnight on the Firing Line">
<text>&quot;Midnight on the Firing Line&quot; is the first episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, following the pilot movie, &quot;The Gathering&quot;. It first aired on January 26, 1994. It was notable for being the first regular television episode which used computer-generated imagery rather than physical models for its special visual effects. The episode also marked the beginning of the first science fiction television series where the entire series had an overarching storyline, which the writer J. Michael Straczynski described as &quot;a novel for television&quot;.

==Title==
According to Straczynski, the title refers to his feelings about the episode and the series. The studio had told him, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ve got a pilot, we don&#x27;t know if the market will sustain more than one space SF series, no other SF series has done well lately ... maybe we ought to air the pilot first, and get the ratings, before committing to a series.&quot; Straczynski wrote, &quot;I knew we&#x27;d come under considerable fire, figured it was cool.&quot; He also mentions that the title is related to a line in a song by Harry Chapin, &quot;and if our future lies on the firing line, are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs&quot;.

==Plot==
Narn warships attack the Centauri agricultural colony at Ragesh 3. Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari, whose nephew Carn is among those at the colony, accosts the Narn ambassador G&#x27;Kar. G&#x27;Kar claims to have only learned of the attack, but states that it is part of the Narn effort working to reclaim their colonies taken during the Narn-Centauri conflict. Londo attempts to sway the Centauri government to issue a military response, but they refuse, and instead he is forced to issue formal charges against the Narn. Londo&#x27;s aide, Vir Cotto, asks Londo about his hatred towards G&#x27;Kar, and Londo recalls a vision of how he will die, on the Centauri homeworld in twenty years, with both he and G&#x27;Kar choking the lives out of each other. Meanwhile, G&#x27;Kar reaches out to Commander Jeffrey Sinclair requesting Earth&#x27;s help to back the Narn, reminding Sinclair that Narn offered to arm Earth during the Minbari wars. Sinclair wants to call the Babylon 5 Advisory Council and the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to take a stance on the matter, but is told by his government that with the Earth election happening that day, they do not want Sinclair to get Earth involved.

Meanwhile, the station&#x27;s new telepath from the Psi Corps, Talia Winters, has been attempting to report to Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova, but Ivanova has avoided her. Security chief Michael Garibaldi learns of attacks being made on transport ships by raiders, and during one investigation, finds they are using more powerful weapons than previously. He links the attacks to a data theft from a transport ship company, including the schedule they use for the jump gates, which allows the raiders to know when and where to attack. Garibaldi debriefs Sinclair, as the only transport not yet attacked will be carrying refugees. Sinclair gets an idea, and instructs Ivanova to take over the diplomatic meeting while he joins the party to stop the raiders.

At the meeting, G&#x27;Kar plays a video recording from Ragesh 3, where Londo&#x27;s nephew Carn states that the Narn were invited to come to the colony, which thus ends Londo&#x27;s charges. A furious Londo assembles components from his quarters which create a gun, and heads towards G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s quarters. He runs into Talia, who senses Londo&#x27;s motives and warns Garibaldi, who stops Londo before he can fire the weapon.

Sinclair leads a fighter squadron from Babylon 5 to protect the last transport, destroying several raider ships and chasing off the rest. Sinclair follows his hunch and tracks down the command and control ship from which raiders were launched. Back at Babylon 5, Sinclair shows the gathered staff and G&#x27;Kar that the command and control ship was selling Narn weapons, something he had recalled from his earlier conversation with G&#x27;Kar, and had data crystals confirming that the Narn attack on Ragesh 3 was unprovoked, and that Carn was coerced into speaking under gunpoint. Sinclair instructs G&#x27;Kar to have Narn leave Ragesh 3 or he will formally report his findings to the Council.

At the end of the day, Ivanova thanks Talia for her help, and explains her trepidation towards telepaths, as her mother had been an unregistered telepath. To comply with the law, the Psi Corps had to inject her with chemicals that caused her to lose her sanity and eventually commit suicide. Ivanova hopes she can strike a better friendship with Talia.

==Writing and story arc significance==
As the series&#x27; creator, Straczynski felt very close to the project, and felt that aside from perhaps wanting more sets to be available for the episode, there wasn&#x27;t really anything about the episode that he would tweak. He was particularly interested in the effect of characters lying onscreen, with the unsuspecting audience finding out about it over time. He writes,

As &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was conceived with an overall five-year story arc, the episode was written as both an individual story, and with another level, where the hints of the larger story arc were given. The series&#x27; creator, J. Michael Straczynski, indicates that the episodes can be watched for the individual stories, the character stories, or the story arc. He writes,

The series story arc develops in this episode through the introduction of the Narn-Centauri conflict, with the Centauri having oppressed and enslaved the Narn people for many years. Now that the Centauri are in decline, the angry Narn attack a defenceless Centauri colony. Londo&#x27;s dream, that he and G&#x27;Kar will strangle each other to death, will also become significant.

Straczynski explains that the conflicts of this episode will be mirrored in the key episode &quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot;, these episodes focussing on the main questions that Babylon 5 addresses: &quot;What is important to you? What are you willing to sacrifice? How far are you willing to go to get what you want?
The episode introduces the main character Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova, and reveals her vulnerability resulting from her family&#x27;s past encounters with the Psi Corps, the controlling organization for telepaths in the Earth Alliance. Also introduced are Talia Winters, a commercial telepath with the Psi Corps, and Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari&#x27;s diplomatic aide, Vir. Straczynski writes that Vir is intentionally appears obsequious at the beginning, to give the character room to develop, as he slowly begins to stand up to Londo.

==Production==
===Cast and filming===
This episode saw some changes in the main cast, with the characters of Lt Commander Laurel Takishima, Dr Benjamin Kyle and Lyta Alexander having left after the pilot episode. This necessitated some changes in the storyline, for originally Takishima was going to be the character who was to shoot Garibaldi in the back in the final episode of the season.

The appearance of Minbari ambassador Delenn – which had originally been envisaged as being male – was softened and made more feminine, which relieved the actress, Mira Furlan. Referring to the difference between the heavy prosthetics of the pilot, and this episode, Furlan stated, &quot;[It] was a whole different experience... I enjoyed having my mouth, my nose, my cheeks, my neck. It was still a lot to deal with, but it brought me back to myself somehow.&quot;

During the filming of the scene at the end where Delenn, and Garibaldi – played by Jerry Doyle – watch the cartoon, &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;, Furlan picked up a kernel of popcorn, carefully examining it. Doyle said that another actor might have just started eating, but that she did that because Delenn – having never seen popcorn before – was intrigued by what the food was. Doyle said that his laughter in that scene was more because of Furlan&#x27;s spin on it than because of the cartoon.

Actress Andrea Thompson – playing telepath Talia Winters – admitted to being rather nervous for the shooting of her first scene. In the first take, she mistakenly said, &quot;I&#x27;m Talia Winters, licensed commercial psychopath,&quot; much to the amusement of Claudia Christian – playing Ivanova – and the rest of the crew, who broke into laughter. Thompson stated that she had to join them laughing, as it was rather humorous, and that it broke the ice, and they then went on to shoot the scene.

According to Straczynski, the photo of the Earth Alliance president Luis Santiago shows executive producer Douglas Netter, and wardrobe designer Ann Bruice is shown as the candidate running against him in the election.

===Visual effects===
This episode marked the first time a regular episode in a television series used computer-generated imagery for all its visual effects. Other than interior sets, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; did not use physical models for its scenes involving space and spacecraft exteriors. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with LightWave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rendering each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

For this episode, Straczynski wanted to open up the locations for the action, by showing more of the space environment where the station was located, and the Starfury fighters, which weren&#x27;t ready at the time of the pilot episode. The Starfury was designed by Steve Burg as a function-driven design for a plausible zero-gravity fighter. The positioning of the four engine pods at the extremities of the craft was inspired by Ron Cobb&#x27;s design for the Gunstar fighter from &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;. The basic shape of the Starfury&#x27;s wings was inspired by an earlier unused design by Burg for a military robot fighting machine, which he had originally designed for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. This was merged with the multi-engined configuration to form the Starfury design. Burg points out that the wings/struts were not aerodynamic: they were there to lever the engines away from the center of mass. Despite having a similar wing configuration to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; X-Wing fighter, this was purely coincidental. Burg recollected, &quot;Ron Thornton was the only person aware of the visual connection with the &quot;Terminator 2&quot; walking machine. For obvious reasons, at the time I had compelling cause to keep the images under wraps. [T]he X-Wing is a very long needle shaped craft from most angles, whereas the Starfury is a very blunt shape. The X-Wing is also very much configured like a WWII fighter. Ideal for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe but not what we were going for on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;flip-and-fire&quot; manoeuvre – where Sinclair&#x27;s Starfury is seen using opposing thrusters to spin around and fire backwards – left a legacy on the 2004 &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series, as Foundation Imaging visual effects supervisor Adam &quot;Mojo&quot; Lebowitz would later work on that series. Thornton recollected, &quot;There were many nods to the B5 &#x27;Flip and Fire&#x27; manoeuvre... Seeing the old Cylon Raider design do a B5 Flip and Fire was awesome.&quot;

The Raiders&#x27; fighters were designed by Ron Thornton. He writes, &quot;I stuck with that design to easily differentiate between the front and the back. It was also really economical - not many polygons which was good as a lot of them would appear on screen - and it was pretty iconic. So when fighting with Starfuries it was really easy to tell who was who.&quot;

===Sound===
Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke, a band member of Tangerine Dream. The voice effects for the Vorlon ambassador Kosh Narenek were also designed by Franke, with the character voiced by Ardwight Chamberlain.

==Commentary and reviews==
Authors Ensley Guffey and Dale Koontz write that a recognized television trope – where an episode sets up events which will profoundly affect the later narrative – was named after this episode. The TV Tropes website used this episode title for this, until later being replaced by the term &quot;innocuously Important Information.&quot; Guffey and Koontz observe that this opening episode starts to develop arguably the series&#x27; most significant ongoing relationships, with Londo and G&#x27;Kar mirroring the larger picture of Centauri and Narn politics, which will be for all five seasons at the core of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Narns have thrown off Centauri oppressors, and have become newly aggressive: their pent-up hatred over generations drives them forward, with a view to finally ending the Centauri. G&#x27;Kar strides into the picture – the manifestation of this aggression – proud, cunning, devious and willing to stop at nothing. The Centauri are in decline with their power waning waning and their prestige now a façade in tatters. &quot;Everyone has an agenda, both personal and political, and intrigue and backroom deals are the order of the day,&quot; they continue, &quot;This is the world of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, the scene set in some 42 minutes. Let the games begin.&quot;

Rowan Kaiser, in the review website &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, is impressed that the series is bold enough to bring together two main characters, Londo and G&#x27;Kar, who are deadly enemies. Kaiser writes about Londo&#x27;s prophetic dream where he and G&#x27;Kar both die, their hands around each others&#x27; throats: &quot;It says &#x27;This will pay off. Keep watching.&#x27; Even though &#x27;Midnight On The Firing Line&#x27; isn&#x27;t the greatest episode—it&#x27;s fine, with some good and a few bad moments—that promise, that conflict, suggests that &quot;Babylon 5&quot; is far more ambitious than it seems.&quot; Kaiser considers this episode as deeply ironic: &quot;What makes it interesting initially is how it sets up the core premise; what makes it interesting later on ... is how those premises get subverted by the events in the narrative. It&#x27;s almost brilliant how perfectly some later episodes mirror this one.&quot;

Elias Rosner writes, in the &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot; website, &quot;[T]his show proved that sci-fi TV could be something grander than an episodic adventure. The year is 2258. The name of the place is &#x27;Babylon 5&#x27;.&quot; Rosner notes that this episode, &quot;hits the ground running&quot;, introducing several major characters and plot exposition in the first seven minutes. He writes that the make-up and set design are stellar, G&#x27;Kar and Londo are show stealers, and that the show makes fictional politics interesting. He writes, &quot;Straczynski ... shows his talent for long term planning and character work here. No plot thread feels unnecessary, with small payoffs that have the beginnings of something larger or large payoffs that are a necessity of the TV medium of the time.&quot;

Jules-Pierre Malartre, writing in the science fiction review site, &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, is particularly impressed by Peter Jurasik&#x27;s performance as Londo. Malartre writes, &quot;You simply have to love Jurasik for breathing so much life into Mollari with such memorable lines as: &#x27;The Council? The Council can go to Hell. The emergency session can go to Hell. And YOU! You can go to Hell too! I-wouldn&#x27;t-want-you-to-feel-left-out!&#x27;

Malartre comments on the dynamics between the characters of Londo and G&#x27;kar, noting that they will both undergo transformation throughout the course of the series, becoming the most nuanced and interesting characters in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He writes that their clash becomes central to the series&#x27; narrative, providing &quot;a magnetic blend of humour, drama, and eventual brotherhood.&quot; He adds, &quot;Their relationship provided some of the best character development moments and outstanding acting performances of the series.&quot;

<doc id="555133" wikidata="Q3345613" url="?curid=555133" title="John Wright (cricketer, born 1954)">
<text>John Geoffrey Wright (born 5 July 1954) is a former international cricketer who represented – and captained – New Zealand. He made his international debut in 1978 against England.

He scored more than 5,000 Test runs (the first New Zealand Test player to do so) at an average of 37.82 runs per dismissal with 12 Test centuries, 10 of them in New Zealand. He also played for Derbyshire in England from 1977 to 1988. In first-class cricket he scored more than 25,000 runs, including more than 50 first-class centuries. He scored over 10,000 runs in List A limited-overs cricket.

Following his retirement in 1993, he coached the Indian national cricket team from 2000 to 2005 and New Zealand from 2010 to 2012. With India, he helped the national team to be one of the dual-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka, and led the team to the finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

== Domestic career ==
John Wright played cricket for his school, Christ&#x27;s College, Christchurch, scoring several centuries. When he was studying at Otago University, he would travel from Dunedin to Christchurch on the weekends to play club cricket in order to make the Canterbury team. Unable to make the Canterbury team, he moved to Gisborne and played five first-class games for Northern Districts in the 1975/76 season. At the end of the season, he travelled to England where he spent time playing club cricket and time training with the Kent team. Later in the 1976 season, he got the opportunity to play for the Kent second XI, scoring 500 runs at an average of 52. Wright also played for Derrick Robins&#x27; XI against Kent, scoring a century.

Wright wrote to Derbyshire asking them for a trial on the basis that they were the only English county side without an overseas player. He was invited to play a couple of trial games. He played in a second XI game for Derbyshire against Nottinghamshire. Opening the batting he proceeded to score 159 not out and then had success in the other trial games. As a result, Wright was offered a one-year contract to play for Derbyshire in 1977. After five first-class games for Derbyshire in 1977, he received his county cap and a pay rise.

== International career ==
Wright typically opened the batting for New Zealand, and was noted as a tenacious, rather than spectacular, batsman. His team nickname was &quot;shake&quot;; reputedly a reflection of his packing technique. Together with Bruce Edgar of Wellington, he formed what was arguably New Zealand&#x27;s most successful and reliable opening partnership. During a match against Australia in 1980, he became the second player in history to score an eight off one ball in a Test, running four and collecting four overthrows. Toward the end of his career he used an unorthodox batting stance. In contrast, most batsman face the bowler with the bat in line with their legs and perpendicular to the ground, Wright would stand with his bat raised parallel to the ground.

Wright was disappointed with the results of his first 20-odd Test matches and after a discussion with Bob Willis, he started working with a sports psychologist. He eventually learnt transcendental meditation. He commented: &quot;Some people call it mental toughness, it wasn&#x27;t mental toughness, it was just being mentally organised, being able to get out there and express yourself in a way you knew you were capable of but you made it hard for yourself because of the pressure you put on yourself&quot;.

Wright&#x27;s Test teammate Ian Smith said of Wright&#x27;s captaincy of the team: &quot;He had an uncanny knack of bringing out the best in players, some of whom, I&#x27;m sure, thought they had already had their best days. I probably played my best cricket under John Wright&#x27;s leadership; Martin Snedden and John Bracewell would be in the same category&quot;.

In the 1988 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Wright was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Wright worked in sales for around two years – self-confessedly without great success. After taking up coaching for Kent County Cricket Club, Wright enjoyed a successful coaching career with India from 2000 to 2005, during which time the team improved immensely, winning a home Test series 2–1 against Australia (which included the historic Kolkata Test which India won coming back from a follow-on with Indian batsman VVS Laxman making 281 not out), drawing a four-match Test series against Australia 1–1 in Australia in 2003–04 (Steve Waugh&#x27;s farewell Test series), winning a series against arch-rivals Pakistan, and reaching the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup held in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The following months saw the team lose form, and series to Australia and Pakistan. In May 2005, former Australian skipper Greg Chappell took over from Wright. Wright was also appointed as coach of the World XI team that played Australia in the ICC Super Series 2005.

On 20 December 2010, Wright was named as New Zealand&#x27;s coach, replacing Mark Greatbatch. He resigned that role in 2012, following New Zealand&#x27;s tour of the West Indies. New Zealand Cricket was keen for him to continue as coach but Wright did not wish to do so. He did not see eye to eye with John Buchanan, who was the Director of Cricket for New Zealand Cricket. &quot;We see things a little differently,&quot; Wright said. &quot;It would be fair to say we&#x27;re probably more comfortable coaching against each other, which we did for four and a half years.&quot;

In January 2013 Wright was appointed head coach of the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. The Mumbai Indians won that edition of the IPL. Wright has worked with the Mumbai Indians for seven years.

== Music career ==
Wright always took his guitar when on tour as a cricketer. He released his debut album &quot;Red Skies&quot; in 2017. The songs are about travelling as an international cricketer and coach. He is planning to release an EP of new songs titled &quot;Jump the Sun&quot;.

==Publications==

In 1990, together with New Zealand writer Paul Thomas, Wright wrote an autobiography, &quot;Christmas in Rarotonga&quot;. In 2006, along with Indian journalist Sharda Ugra and Paul Thomas, Wright co-authored the book &quot;John Wright&#x27;s Indian Summers&quot; describing his experiences as coach of the Indian team.

<doc id="555136" wikidata="Q112053" url="?curid=555136" title="Tailcoat">
<text>A tailcoat is a knee-length coat characterised by a rear section of the skirt (known as the &quot;tails&quot;), with the front of the skirt cut away.

The tailcoat shares its historical origins in clothes cut for convenient horse-riding in the Early Modern era. From the 18th century, however, tailcoats evolved into general forms of day and evening formal wear, in parallel to how the lounge suit succeeded the frock coat (19th century) and the justacorps (18th century).

Thus, in 21st-century Western dress codes for men, mainly two types of tailcoats have survived:
#[[Tailcoat#Dress coat|Dress coat]], an evening wear item with a squarely cut-away front, worn for formal white tie
#[[Tailcoat#Morning coat|Morning coat]] (or &quot;cutaway&quot; in American English), a day-wear item with a gradually tapered front cut away, worn for formal morning dress

In colloquial language without further specification, &quot;tailcoat&quot; typically designates the former, that is the evening (1) dress coat for white tie.

==History==


===Shadbelly===

In equestrianism, a variant called a shadbelly is still worn in certain disciplines in its eighteenth-century role as daytime formalwear. It is basically a form of dress coat which is closer in cut to the early nineteenth-century style worn by Beau Brummel than to the modern version worn with evening formal dress. The male version of the shadbelly is often called a &quot;weaselbelly&quot;.

===Levée dress coat===

This is a type of dress coat traditionally worn with court dress, until the mid-twentieth century. It was made of black velvet and traditionally worn at court, levées, and evening state parties by those who did not wear uniforms. A version made of black barathea was also worn as diplomatic dress.

It was single breasted with a stand-up collar, with plain gauntlet cuffs, and two three-pointed flap pockets on the waist seam. It had six metal buttons at the front, and two decorative buttons at the back. The body of the coat was lined with black silk, and skirts with white silk. It was worn with breeches, black silk hose, white bow tie, white gloves, and court shoes (pumps) with steel buckles. The front of the coat was cut away squarely like a standard dress coat.

=== Military coatee ===
From c. 1790 until after the Crimean War, a red tail coat with short tails, known as a coatee, was part of the infantry uniform of the British army. The collar and cuffs were in the regimental colors and the coats had white braid on the front. Elite light infantry units like the 95th Rifles were issued short green coats to provide camouflage and ease of movement.

The Americans issued a similar uniform in dark blue to enlisted men during the War of 1812. This remained in service until 1833 when it was replaced with a shell jacket. Officers continued to wear tail coats until after the Mexican War when frock coats became the standard field wear. By the time the M1858 uniform was introduced tail coats had been relegated to full dress.

The Royal Navy had an elaborate hierarchy of tailcoats for the officers, allowing further buttons and gilding according to rank and seniority. These were single-breasted for junior officers and double-breasted for those with the rank of lieutenant and above.

===Highland coatee===

This is worn with Highland dress, and has a square cut away front like a dress coat, but the tails are cut significantly shorter.

===Footman&#x27;s coat===

This was worn as livery, a servant&#x27;s uniform. It was knee length with a sloped cut-away front like a morning coat. It was single breasted with a stand-up collar and gilt buttons. There were three-pronged side pockets similar in style to the levée dress coat.

==Dress coat==
A dress coat, sometimes called a swallow-tail or claw-hammer coat, is the coat that has, since the 1850s, come to be worn only in the evening by men as part of the white tie dress code, also known as evening full dress, for formal evening occasions. It is commonly referred to as just a &quot;tailcoat&quot; in America, or &quot;tails&quot; in Great Britain, but amongst tailors (both British and American) and dress historians it is traditionally called a dress coat to differentiate it from other types of tailcoats.

The modern dress coat is an evolution of the coat that was once both day and evening dress. It became increasingly popular from around the late 1790s and was particularly widespread during the British Regency, and in America in the 1830s to 1850s. The dress coat was supplanted in the 1840s as formal day wear by the frock coat, which was in turn replaced in the early twentieth century by the morning coat. In the Regency period, the dress coat with gilt buttons was always worn with non-matching trousers, pantaloons or breeches. Since the Victorian era, the modern dress coat for evening wear has been worn with matching trousers of the same cloth with two stripes of braiding down the side. The resulting suit is traditionally referred to by tailors as a &quot;dress suit&quot;.

A dress coat is waist length in the front and sides, and has two long tails reaching to the knees in back. Sometimes there is a pocket on the inside to hold gloves. Since around the 1840s the dress coat has lacked outside side pockets, but prior to this it took flapped side pockets. Since the early twentieth century, it has become acceptable in America to have a welted pocket on the outside of the chest to hold a pocket square, but prior to this dress coats lacked any outer pockets. The front of the skirt is squarely cut away. Since around the 1830s the coat has been constructed with a waist seam that allows greater waist suppression. From the Victorian era, the revers has taken facings in silk (grosgrain or satin) on the lapels. Although it is double-breasted, since the 1870s, the dress coat no longer fastens in the front. As a result, although there are two rows of buttons, these are all non-functional, serving only a decorative function.

As part of modern &quot;white tie&quot;, a black dress coat is worn with a stiff, white wing-collar dress shirt, with a plain starched (pique or plain-weave) bib that takes shirt studs, single cuffs fastened with cufflinks (of a white metal); a matching white marcella cotton or satin silk bowtie and white waistcoat; black trousers with one or two silk galon; and black oxfords (without a toe cap) or pumps; the shoes must be polished to a mirror shine or be made of patent leather and are worn with black, over-the-calf silk socks. Additionally, a top hat, silk dress scarf, and white dress gloves are either seen as acceptable or mandatory. A gentleman&#x27;s top hat was traditionally made of silk plush, although the last supplies of this material have now been exhausted, so inferior hats are made of silk or felt cloth.

==Morning coat==
A morning coat is a single-breasted coat, with the front parts usually meeting at one button in the middle, and curving away gradually into a pair of tails behind, topped by two ornamental buttons on the waist seam. The lapels are usually pointed (American English peak), not step (notch), since the coat is now only worn as formalwear. When it was first introduced, the step lapel was common, since it was worn as half dress. The coat can be grey or black as part of morning dress, and is usually worn with striped, or very occasionally checked, trousers.

The morning coat may also be worn as part of a morning suit, which is mid-grey with matching trousers and waistcoat.
The modern morning coat (or cutaway in American English) is a man&#x27;s coat worn as the principal item in morning dress. The name derives from morning nineteenth-century horseback riding exercise for gentlemen. It was regarded as an informal form of half dress. Gradually it became acceptable as an alternative to the frock coat for formal day wear or full dress. Since the nineteenth century it is normally only seen at weddings, at formal baptisms, and in England and Australia, at races such as Royal Ascot, the Derby and the Victoria Derby where it is worn with a contrasting waistcoat, usually light grey or sometimes &quot;fancy&quot;, and perhaps in club colours. It is very occasionally seen at funerals but more often it is used as day wear at formal luncheons, especially civic occasions under formal gowns, when worn with a black matching waistcoat (vest). Male members of the cabinet of Japan wear it in their first public appearance following the formation of the cabinet.

The Marshal and Clerk of the United States Supreme Court wear morning coats when the justices are appearing in public wearing their traditional robes, for example when the court is in session, or when attending the President&#x27;s State of the Union address. At one time all attorneys appearing before the court wore morning coats but they now wear standard business attire. The United States Solicitor General (when the office is held by a male) and his or her male deputies continue the tradition of wearing morning dress when arguing before the court.

In modern American English, morning coats are referred to as &quot;cutaway coats&quot;.

<text>A small press is a publisher with annual sales below a certain level or below a certain number of titles published. The terms &quot;indie publisher&quot; and &quot;independent press&quot; and others are sometimes used interchangeably. However, when a distinction is drawn, there are about 100,000 small presses and about one million independent presses.

Independent press is generally defined as publishers that are not part of large conglomerates or multinational corporations. Even when owned by a larger business, an independent press is allowed to choose which books to publish, and the business will survive or fail as a result of how well those books sell. Many small presses rely on specialization in genre fiction, poetry, or limited-edition books or magazines, but there are also thousands that focus on niche non-fiction markets.

Other terms for small press, sometimes distinguished from each other and sometimes used interchangeably, are small publishers, independent publishers, or indie presses.

Independent publishers (as defined above) made up about half of the market share of the book publishing industry in the United States in 2007. The majority of small presses are independent or indie publishers, meaning that they are separate from the handful of major publishing house conglomerates, such as Random House or Hachette.

== Characteristics ==
Since the profit margins for small presses can be narrow, many are driven by other motives, including the desire to help disseminate literature with only a small likely market. Many presses are also associated with crowdfunding efforts that help connect authors with readers. 

Small presses tend to fill the niches that larger publishers neglect. They can focus on regional titles, narrow specializations and niche genres. They can also make up for commercial clout by creating a reputation for academic knowledge, vigorously pursuing prestigious literature prizes and spending more effort nurturing the careers of new authors. At its most minimal, small press production consists of chapbooks. This role can now be taken on by desktop publishing and web sites. This still leaves a continuum of small press publishing: from specialist periodicals, short runs or print-to-order of low-demand books, to fine art books and limited editions of collectors&#x27; items printed to high standards.

Unlike a vanity press or self-publishing service, a small press rarely publishes books written by the owner or publisher. Instead, these are small businesses, often with only a few employees, who select books written by other authors.

== Micro-presses ==
There is now also a distinction made between small presses and micro-presses. A micro-press can be defined as a publisher that produces chapbooks and other small books on a very small scale (e.g. 50 copies of one book per year). It can also be defined in terms of revenue. Micro-presses are often run as a hobby or part-time job because of their low profits. They may not produce enough profit to support their owners.

In Canada, these are considered small press publishers, but the standard small press book run is accepted at 300 copies of a chapbook and 500 or more copies of a spine-bound book. In doing this, small press publishers are eligible for grants from the Ontario Arts Council and the Canada Council.

== Not to be confused with ==
Small presses should not be confused with self-publishing presses (sometimes called &quot;vanity presses&quot;). Self-publishing or subsidy presses usually require payment by authors, or a minimum purchase of copies. By comparison, small presses make their profits by selling books to consumers, rather than selling services to authors or selling a small number of copies to the author&#x27;s friends.

Small presses should not be confused with printers. Small presses are traditional publishers, which means that they engage in a book selection process, along with editing, marketing and distribution. Small presses also enter into a contract with the author, often paying royalties for being allowed to sell the book. Publishers own the copies they have printed, but usually do not own the copyright to the book itself. In contrast, printers merely print a book, and sometimes offer limited distribution if they are a POD printing press. Printers have a very low selectivity. They will accept nearly anyone who can pay the cost of printing. They rarely offer editing or marketing. Printers do not own the copies that are printed, and they do not pay royalties.

Book packagers combine aspects of small presses and printers, but they are technically neither small presses nor printers.

==History==
Small presses became distinguishable from jobbing printers at some time towards the end of the nineteenth century. The roots lie with the Arts and Crafts movement, particularly the Kelmscott Press. The use of small letterpress machines by amateur printers increased proportionately to the mechanization of commercial printing. Later, the advance of practical lithography made small press publication much easier. The 1960s and 1970s are considered the small press&#x27;s golden age in the USA. The unprecedented proliferation of small and independent publishers at the time was a result of the so-called &#x27;Mimeo Revolution&#x27; and the proliferation of DIY and affordable reproduction technologies. 

A recent burgeoning of small presses has been caused by the introduction of digital printing, especially print on demand technology. Combined with Internet based marketing, digital typesetting, design tools with the rise of eBooks, the new printing technologies have lowered the economic barriers to entry, allowing many new niches to be served, and many new publishers to enter the industry. A notable boom of small press publishing has been observed since the 2008 economic crisis.

==By country==

===Australia===

Small presses have played a significant part historically in recognising new voices and publishing notable works of literary fiction in Australia, but the market was seen as a tough one in 1999, despite about 80 per cent of the Australian Publishers Association being small book publishers (defined as those with less than AU$2m), nearly all Australian-owned.

In recent years, though, the small publishers have especially made gains as big publishers have backed away from publishing literary works. Small press publications have won some of the greatest literary prizes, including the Stella Prize, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Literary Award for Fiction and the Miles Franklin Literary Award. There was a strong upward trend in the number of titles published by small press and shortlisted for the Miles Franklin and the PM&#x27;s Fiction Awards in the two years preceding 2017.

The Small Press Network (SPN), located at the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne, represents small and independent publishers in Australia, which promotes independent publishing and supports diversity within the industry &quot;as a vital component of Australian literary culture&quot;. Founded in 2006, it has grown to represent more than 140 members in Australia and New Zealand. Its members include such publishers as the &quot;Griffith Review&quot;, National Library of Australia Publishing, Scribe and Wakefield Press, as well as many smaller publishers.

<doc id="555142" wikidata="Q7564242" url="?curid=555142" title="Soul Hunter (Babylon 5)">
<text>&quot;Soul Hunter&quot; is the second episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. The episode concerns the arrival of a member of an ancient order, the Soul Hunters, on the Babylon 5 station; and reveals a mystery surrounding Commander Sinclair&#x27;s missing 24 hours during the Earth-Minbari War. It first aired on 2 February 1994.

==Title==
The title refers to the Soul Hunter, a member of an ancient alien order which claims they collect and preserve the souls of distinguished people at the moment of death.

==Plot==
An unknown damaged ship appears through the jump gate and hurtles towards the Babylon 5 station. Commander Sinclair grapples the ship onboard the station with his Starfury fighter, and the ship&#x27;s occupant is taken to MedLab. In MedLab, upon seeing the patient, the Minbari Ambassador, Delenn, suddenly enters a burst of rage, and tries to shoot the patient. She explains to Sinclair that the patient is a &quot;Shak Tot&quot;, a Soul Hunter, a member of an ancient alien order who try to collect and preserve the souls of distinguished people at the moment of death. The Minbari despise them, considering them thieves and kidnappers, &quot;ripping away that which is eternal&quot;. Delenn urges Sinclair to send the Soul Hunter away while he still can.

The alien population aboard the station has gone into hiding, and several ships have asked to leave the station ahead of schedule. The Soul Hunter explains to Sinclair that his order are not thieves, merely preservers. They had been prevented from &quot;preserving&quot; the soul of the Minbari leader Dukhat at the beginning of the Earth-Minbari War. Sinclair asks the Soul Hunter to leave as soon as his ship is repaired.

The Soul Hunter recognizes Delenn from his previous attempt to &quot;preserve&quot; Dukhat&#x27;s soul for his collection. He identifies Delenn as a &quot;Satai&quot; – a member of the nine-member Grey Council, the ruling body of the Minbari people – asking her why, as a great leader of the Minbari, she is here &quot;playing ambassador&quot;.

A second Soul Hunter arrives on board Babylon 5. He explains to Sinclair that the first Soul Hunter is a disturbed renegade. Having failed to &quot;preserve&quot; Dukhat&#x27;s soul, he has become increasingly frustrated and unstable; and he has turned to killing people before their natural death in order to capture their souls.

Meanwhile, the first Soul Hunter has kidnapped Delenn, and starts to drain her life force. In doing so, he catches a glimpse of her hidden purposes on the station, exclaiming, &quot;You plan such a thing? Incredible.&quot; Sinclair locates them, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. The Soul Hunter says, &quot;Why do you fight for her? Don&#x27;t you understand? She is &quot;Satai&quot;... I&#x27;ve seen her soul: they&#x27;re using you.&quot; Sinclair is thrown to the ground. The Soul Hunter&#x27;s soul-capturing machine, trained upon on Delenn, activates. Sinclair gets up and turns the soul-draining machine away from Delenn and trains the beam onto the Soul Hunter. The Soul Hunter cries out, and he falls to the ground, his soul being captured by the machine and transferred into a spherical soul vessel.

As Delenn recovers in the MedLab, Sinclair in his quarters does a search for the Minbari word &quot;Satai&quot;, discovering that Delenn is a member of the Minbari Grey Council. Later, Sinclair escorts the second Soul Hunter off the station, telling him that the Soul Hunters are not welcome aboard the station. The Soul Hunter enquires what became of his brother&#x27;s collection of soul vessels.

Delenn sits cross-legged in her quarters, with the Soul Hunter&#x27;s soul vessels, setting the souls free one by one. 

==Writing and story arc significance==
As &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was conceived with an overall five-year story arc, the episode was written as both an individual story and with another level, where the hints of the larger story arc were given, such as Delenn&#x27;s secrecy about her role on the Grey Council. The series&#x27; creator, J. Michael Straczynski, indicates that the episodes can be watched for the individual stories, the character stories, or the story arc.

Regarding the dilemma posed by the opposing views on the afterlife of the soul hunter and Delenn, Straczynski writes,

In relation to the question of the existence of souls, Straczynski writes, &quot;I carefully don&#x27;t address that issue in the course of the script. My job is not to provide people with answers. My job as a storyteller is to ask questions and provoke discussions and start bar fights.&quot;

Straczynski also singles out the mystery surrounding Delenn. He writes, &quot;that also ties in with Sinclair&#x27;s mysteries. Clearly, something suspicious is going on with the Minbari, and it all connects to the war with Earth ten years prior. All very important, and as usual, something that will payoff in the future&quot;.

This episode discusses the question of souls, which will become central to the story arc, linking with Sinclair&#x27;s missing twenty-four hours during the Earth-Minbari War, and the Minbari insisting on his appointment as commander of Babylon 5. It sets up for the revelation about Sinclair which Lennier reveals in &quot;Points of Departure&quot;, the opening episode of season two; but the entire truth will not be seen until the second half of the third season. When the Soul Hunter reveals to Sinclair that the Minbari are using him, he is referring to the Minbari setting him in a position to become their religious leader. The episode also gives some background regarding the death of Dukhat, the Minbari leader, and the beginning of the Earth-Minbari War.

==Production==
===Cast and filming===
The Soul Hunter was played by W. Morgan Sheppard, an actor with a theater background. Mira Furlan, who played Delenn, said, &quot;He has such a theater background, which reminded me of my past in Yugoslavia, all the stories, the theater stories, the old actors. It was as if I were thrown back into the theater, the heavy stage acting with which I was so familiar. The European flair was there, and we had a nice time working together.

The episode was directed by Jim Johnston, who directed a large number of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episodes, directing six in the first season. &quot;Soul Hunter&quot; was his first experience at directing science fiction. Johnston stated that he liked the sets, with their long corridors which allowed him to use a steadicam and long dolly moves around the set. Johnston employed dark lighting to create a mysterious mood for the episode. He worked together with Morgan Sheppard to create an alien feel to the character of the Soul Hunter. Sheppard came up with the idea of walking in such a way that he seemed to float, and a gown was created for him so that his feet moving could not be seen.

The episode introduced the character of Dr Franklin, played by Richard Biggs. Biggs had already filmed the fourth episode, &#x27;Infection&#x27;, which helped him for the filming of the arrival of the doctor on the station. Biggs stated, &quot;I had gotten a little bit more secure and a little bit more relaxed and then got to play the entrance of the character.&quot;

===Visual effects and sound===
For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, as seen when Sinclair&#x27;s fighter matches the rotation of the soul hunter&#x27;s spinning ship in order to grapple it; or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with Lightwave 3D and Video Toaster software, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

The Starfury fighter, which Commander Sinclair uses to grapple the Soul Hunter ship, was designed by Steve Burg as a function-driven design for a plausible zero-gravity fighter. The positioning of the four engine pods at the extremities of the craft was inspired by Ron Cobb&#x27;s design for the Gunstar fighter from &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;. The basic shape of the Starfury&#x27;s wings was inspired by an earlier unused design by Burg for a military robot fighting machine, which he had originally designed for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. This was merged with the multi-engined configuration to form the Starfury design. Burg points out that the wings/struts were not aerodynamic: they were there to lever the engines away from the center of mass.

The Soul Hunter ships were designed by Foundation Imaging co-founder Ron Thornton. He indicated, &quot;I get away with making the [virtual digital model&#x27;s textures] out of wood, and bone. As if it used the tusks of some unknown huge beast for parts.&quot;

The scene where Sinclair&#x27;s Starfury grapples the spinning soul hunter ship attempts to show the fighter using thrusters to manoeuvre using realistic physics. Thornton stated that the producers &quot;initially wanted &quot;Star Wars&quot;, there was also a lot of, &#x27;[let&#x27;s] do something that &quot;Star Trek&quot; can&#x27;t!&#x27; I said we could make realistic physics exciting, and make the fans happy... [Visual effects supervisor Paul Bryant] and I pushed really hard for realistic physics as we both loved &quot;2001&quot;&quot;.

Writer J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s original intention was that Sinclair&#x27;s ship was to use magnetic energy to capture the Soul Hunter&#x27;s ship. However, Thornton suggested using a grappling arm instead, stating, &quot;I wanted to try something more interesting that hadn&#x27;t been seen before. It was also a good opportunity to help me solidify to Joe and John how we could make the real physics exciting and make the pilots of the Starfuries seem like Top Guns. But not like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as we could have our own distinctive and very different look.&quot; The scene was animated by Foundation Imaging artists Tim Wilcox and Mark Kochinski.

The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for episode 5 of the season, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot;

Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke.

==Commentary and reviews==
Author Jane Killick writes that &quot;Soul Hunter&quot; was the episode where &quot;Babylon 5&quot; started to meet the expectations of many people. She observes, &quot;All the elements are there: a good story, strong characterization, action, pace, special effects and a contribution to the story arc.&quot; 
She notes that &quot;Soul Hunter&quot; was a strong episode for Delenn, exploring the character in greater depth than previously: showing her gentleness, strength and the mystery of her plans on Babylon 5.

Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, draws the parallel between the previous episode, being an exposition for Londo and G&#x27;Kar, and this episode, as an exposition for Sinclair and Delenn. Kaiser is intrigued by the philosophical opposition of the views of the soul hunter, who feels he is preserving souls, and those of Delenn, who feels he is keeping souls from their eternal destiny. Kaiser writes, Soul Hunter&#x27; may be an average episode, saddled by a bit too much ambition and a few too many flaws, but that&#x27;s why, as a critic, I find myself drawn to it. It&#x27;s trying to say and do big things, and the effort is worth examining.&quot;

Elias Rosner writes in &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, &quot;As a second episode, you could do with much worse than &#x27;Soul Hunter.&#x27; It&#x27;s got a creepy antagonist, a personal motivation/connection for one of the characters, ... to said antagonist, and keeps its focus on the central plotline for the entire episode.&quot; However, Rosner feels that the exaggerated dramatics are a weakness which may outweigh the episode&#x27;s strengths.
He notes that the unanswered questions raised in the episode – concerning the Grey Council, Delenn&#x27;s membership of it, the secrecy surrounding this, and how they are using Sinclair – give us reason to watch Delenn closely in subsequent episodes to try to discover what her game is. He concludes, &quot;this episode, despite all its flaws, shows what can be done when in the right hands.

<text>GameMaker (originally Animo, Game Maker (until 2011) and GameMaker Studio) is a series of cross-platform game engines created by Mark Overmars in 1999 and developed by YoYo Games since 2007. The latest iteration of &quot;GameMaker&quot; was released in 2022.

GameMaker accommodates the creation of cross-platform and multi-genre video games using a custom drag-and-drop visual programming language or a scripting language known as Game Maker Language (GML), which can be used to develop more advanced games. GameMaker was originally designed to allow novice computer programmers to be able to make computer games without much programming knowledge by use of these actions. Recent versions of software also focus on appealing to advanced developers.

== Overview ==
GameMaker is primarily intended for making games with 2D graphics, allowing out-of-box use of raster graphics, vector graphics (via SWF), and 2D skeletal animations (via Esoteric Software&#x27;s Spine) along with a large standard library for drawing graphics and 2D primitives. While the software allows for limited use of 3D graphics, this is in form of vertex buffer and matrix functions, and as such not intended for novice users.

The engine uses Direct3D on Windows, UWP, and Xbox One; OpenGL on macOS and Linux; OpenGL ES on Android and iOS, WebGL or 2d canvas on HTML5, and proprietary APIs on consoles.

The engine&#x27;s primary element is an IDE with built-in editors for raster graphics, level design, scripting, paths, and shaders (GLSL or HLSL). Additional functionality can be implemented in software&#x27;s scripting language or platform-specific native extensions. In GameMaker Studio 2, users can choose whether to export the game as an NSIS installer, or a .zip file containing the game, the data.win file, and any files added under the &quot;Included Files&quot; tab in the editor.

=== Supported platforms ===
GameMaker supports building for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, HTML5, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Raspberry Pi, Microsoft UWP, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One; support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S was announced in February 2021 though an &quot;Enterprise&quot; license is needed to build games for these consoles.

In past, GameMaker supported building for Windows Phone (deprecated in favor of UWP), Tizen, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita (not supported in GMS2 &quot;largely for business reasons&quot;).

PlayStation Portable support was demonstrated in May 2010, but never made publicly available (with only a small selection of titles using it).

Between 2007 and 2011, YoYo Games maintained a custom web player plugin for GameMaker games before releasing it as open-source mid-2011 and finally deprecating in favor of HTML5 export.

Prior to August 2021, users had to obtain a single-purchase license for one of five different platforms, excluding consoles, depending on the target platform they wanted to publish on (such as desktop or mobile). An annual license was required to publish for consoles, which was also contained in an all-encompassing annual Ultimate license that covered all supported platforms. Yoyo Games announced a change to the licensing approach in August 2021, allowing GameMaker to be used for free to learn, and eliminating the single-purchase options. Instead, it simplified the license scheme to only two tiers, one that supported publishing on all non-console platforms, and a higher tier that added in console platform publishing support at a lower rate than the prior Ultimate license. These changes were aided by the financial investment of Opera into YoYo Games to help reduce costs for GameMaker users. On 22 November 2023, GameMaker announced that it would be &quot;free for non-commercial use on all platforms (excluding console),&quot; and the current subscription system would be replaced by a one-time license.

== GameMaker Language ==
GameMaker Language (GML) is GameMaker&#x27;s scripting language. It is an imperative, dynamically typed language commonly likened to JavaScript and C-like languages.

The language&#x27;s default mode of operation on native platforms is via a stack machine; it can also be source-to-source compiled to C++ via LLVM for higher performance. On HTML5, GML is source-to-source compiled to JavaScript with optimizations and minification applied in non-debug builds.

=== GML Visual ===
GML Visual (originally called &quot;Drag and Drop&quot;) is GameMaker&#x27;s visual scripting tool.

GML Visual allows developers to perform common tasks (like instantiating objects, calling functions, or working with files and data structures) without having to write a single line of code. It is largely aimed at novice users.

While historically GML Visual remained fairly limited in what can be comfortably done with it, GameMaker Studio 2 had seen an overhaul to the system, allowing more tasks to be done with GML Visual, and having it translate directly to code (with an in-IDE preview for users interested in migrating to code).

== History ==
GameMaker was originally developed by Mark Overmars. The program was first released on 15 November 1999 under the name of Animo (at the time, it was just a graphics tool with limited visual scripting capabilities). The first versions of the program were being developed in Delphi.

Subsequent releases saw the name changed to Game Maker and software moving towards more general-purpose 2D game development.

Versions 5.0 and below were freeware; version 5.1 introduced an optional registration fee; version 5.3 (January 2004) introduced a number of new features for registered users, including particle systems, networking, and possibility to extend games using DLLs.

Version 6.0 (October 2004) introduced limited functionality for use of 3D graphics, as well as migrating the runtime&#x27;s drawing pipeline from VCL to DirectX.

Growing public interest led Overmars to seek help in expanding the program, which led to partnership with YoYo Games in 2007. From this point onward, development was handled by YoYo Games while Overmars retained a position as one of the company&#x27;s directors. Version 7.0 was the first to emerge under this partnership.

The first macOS compatible version of program was released in 2009, allowing games to be made for two operating systems with minimal changes.

Version 8.1 (April 2011) saw the name changed to GameMaker (lacking a space) to avoid any confusion with the 1991 software &quot;Game-Maker&quot;. This version also had the runtime rewritten in C++ to address performance concerns with previous versions.

September 2011 saw the initial release of &quot;GameMaker: HTML5&quot; - a new version of software with capability to export games for web browsers along with desktop.

GameMaker: Studio entered public beta in March 2012 and enjoyed a full release in May 2012. Initial supported platforms included Windows, Mac, HTML5, Android, and iOS. Additional platforms and features were introduced over the years following; Late 2012 there was an accident with anti-piracy measures misfiring for some legitimate users.

In February 2015, GameMaker was acquired by Playtech together with YoYo Games. Announcement reassured that GameMaker will be further improved and states plans to appeal to broader demographic, including more advanced developers.

November 2016 saw the initial release of GameMaker Studio 2 beta, with full release in March 2017. This version spots a completely redesigned IDE (rewritten in C#) and a number of new editor and runtime features.

In August 2020, major update 2.3 was released, bringing a host of new features to IDE, runtime, and the scripting language.

In January 2021, YoYo Games was sold to Opera Software for roughly 10 million USD. The development team of GameMaker remains the same, and has not caused any major development changes to GameMaker Studio.

In August 2021, YoYo Games announced that they would be changing their licenses to offer a free version of the GameMaker engine.

In January 2022, YoYo Games changed GameMaker Studio 2&#x27;s numbering scheme so the version corresponds to the year and the month it was released (For example, 2022.1 for January 2022).

In April 2022, YoYo Games dropped the &quot;GameMaker Studio 2&quot; name in order to match its new version numbering scheme, changing it to simply GameMaker.

== Reception ==
The program currently holds a rating of 8.5/10 on Mod DB based on 223 user reviews; many cite its flexibility and ease of use as positives and instability, crashes, project corruption and outdated features as negatives. Douglas Clements of &quot;Indie Game Magazine&quot; wrote that the program &quot;[s]implifies and streamlines game development&quot; and is &quot;easy for beginners yet powerful enough to grow as you develop&quot;, though noting that &quot;resource objects have to be gathered if unable to create&quot; and that licensing between Steam and the YoYo Games website is &quot;convoluted&quot;.

<doc id="555156" wikidata="Q4946026" url="?curid=555156" title="Born to the Purple">
<text>&quot;Born to the Purple&quot; is the third episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. The episode deals with Centauri ambassador, Londo Mollari, having important files on him stolen by his lover, Adira Tyree.

==Title==
The title has a double meaning, referring to a person who has been born to rule, and also to the Centauri Purple Files, files held on prominent Centauri figures for the purpose of blackmail and extortion.

==Plot==
Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is trying to negotiate a treaty between the Narn and Centauri governments over a disputed sector of space, with help of telepath Talia Winters. While Narn ambassador G&#x27;Kar cooperates freely, they have trouble drawing Centauri ambassador Mollari from his love interest, an exotic dancer named Adira Tyree. Unknown to them, Adira is a slave owned by Trakis who wants Adira to acquire Mollari&#x27;s &quot;purple files&quot;: files that contain high-level information about the Centauri government. Adira is conflicted between her love for Mollari, and Trakis&#x27; threats. She tricks Mollari into drinking a sleeping agent that allows her time to learn his passwords and access the files. However, when she is scheduled to trade them to Trakis, she flees.

Trakis approaches Mollari, convincing him that Adira was working against him, and showing him the papers which give Trakis ownership of Adira as his slave. Feeling scorned, Mollari continues to put off the negotiations in order to look for Adira. He asks Commander Sinclair to support his search for Adira; Sinclair agrees on the condition that Mollari accepts his proposal for a treaty with the Narn. Meanwhile, Trakis hires criminals to track down Adira. These men attack Sinclair and Mollari but soon are called off, as Adira has been found by Trakis. Sinclair, with G&#x27;Kar and Talia&#x27;s help, tricks Trakis into revealing where he has kept Adira on the station. With Sinclair&#x27;s help, Mollari gets Adira&#x27;s ownership papers from Trakis and gives them to her, freeing her. He attempts to convince her to stay aboard Babylon 5 since the threat has passed, but she wants to return to a Centauri world.

Meanwhile, Garibaldi discovers that someone is using the high-priority secure gold channel to make external communications from the station, something that should only be authorized by Sinclair. He approaches Ivanova about it, and she suggests it might be the work of &quot;gremlins&quot;. After several failed attempts, each of which has Ivanova suggesting Garibaldi look elsewhere, he manages to catch the channel being used again and finds that it is Ivanova herself speaking with her terminally ill father. It is his last call to her, apologizing for being a bad father to her and making up to her before he dies. Garibaldi reports to Ivanova that he found the source of the gold channel communication, stating that it was just a computer glitch while also implying that he knows the truth; knowing of her loss, he offers to buy her a drink later.

==Writing==
The episode was written by screenwriter Larry DiTillio, who also contributed to the series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; along with Straczynski. The original title of the episode was &quot;Amaranth&quot;, being later changed to &quot;Born to the Purple&quot;. The premise given to DiTillio originally did not include the Purple Files, and instead dealt with the mind-altering drug Dust, which appears in Season 3. DiTillio wanted the story to go to a higher level and conceived the idea of the Purple Files. DiTillio stated, &quot;It was nice to show Londo as the romantic, which he really is, and to show that his flaw is that he&#x27;s always been searching for love, which, of course, comes to tragic consequences in Season Three.&quot;

==Production==
The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – won the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series for episode 5 of the season, &#x27;The Parliament of Dreams&#x27;

Adira was played by Argentine-Italian actress Fabiana Udenio. According to showrunner J. Michael Straczynski, Udenio wore a prosthetic head piece to simulate the largely-bald hairstyle of Centauri women. Straczynski comments, &quot;[T]he one time we have a bald woman as a background extra, those not in the know on stage kept commenting on how fake the bald-cap looked.&quot;

Trakis was played by New Zealand stage actor Clive Revill, known for his work in musical theatre, and with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Revill also voiced Emperor Palpatine in the original 1980 version of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

Claudia Christian, in reference to playing an emotional scene where her father dies, said, &quot;I think it shows a lot of quiet resolve and strength. It also is an indication of how bloody important her job is. I mean, yes she&#x27;s hiding her feelings by immersing herself in work, but on the other hand she&#x27;s a pro. &#x27;I&#x27;ve lost everyone in my family, and I still go to work. Jerry Doyle, who played Garibalidi, commented, &quot;She did a really nice job in showing the vulnerability of her character and the dignity of her position ... It was a nice character moment for both of us.&quot;

For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with Lightwave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

The Centauri transport ship shown in the episode was created by Foundation Imaging visual effects supervisor Adam &quot;Mojo&quot; Lebowitz, inspired by the design of the Rebel transport ships from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Lebowitz recalls, &quot;I only designed (and built) one ship, the Centauri transport that looks a bit like a Volkswagon. I just felt like building a model, I rarely did it and didn&#x27;t think it was a strength, so it was important to me to give it a go and try to grow as an artist.&quot;

According to &quot;A Dream Given Form: The Unofficial Guide to the Universe of Babylon 5&quot;, the prop for bouquet containing the rare star lace flowers which Londo gives to Adira, actually contained small white Christmas lights rather than flowers.

Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race.

The episode was mixed on 4 October 1993, and aired on 9 February 1994.

==Commentary and reviews==
Ensley Guffey and Dale Koontz comment on Peter Jurasik&#x27;s performance as Londo Mollari: &quot;The result is a multidimensional portrait of a man as complex as he is contradictory, painted with exquisite care and surprising subtlety by Jurasik. Loud, proud, tender, brash, baleful, humorous, and heartbreaking, in this episode Londo Mollari truly comes to life in all his bittersweet glory.&quot; They also praise Claudia Christian&#x27;s performance as Lieutenant Commander Ivanova: &quot;Claudia Christian brings a perfect mix of stoicism, Russian fatalism, and ironic humor to her character, all simmering atop a deep well of anger and grief, which is beautifully revealed in her final conversation with her estranged father. Ivanova&#x27;s own mask of command is laid briefly aside in this episode, revealing the human woman beneath.&quot; They point out that Ivanova here shows an important aspect of her character which is shown throughout the series: that she is willing to break the rules in order to do the right thing.

Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, notes that while the episode is not outstanding, it plays an important role is setting up the character of Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari. Kaiser writes, &quot;Its events are directly referenced later, and they&#x27;re important to a major character&#x27;s dramatic arc, but the episode itself is pretty middling.&quot;

Elias Rosner, writing in &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, observes, &quot;For all the strengths displayed these last couple episodes, they&#x27;ve all been standalones and continuity-wise, don&#x27;t really reference each other ... The individual, episodic plot threads are less about moving the narrative along and more about moving the characters, redefining them, or giving insight into who they are.&quot;
Rosner notes the unusual beginning to Ivanova&#x27;s character arc: &quot;It&#x27;s also interesting that this is the place the writers chose to start ... Not with the knowledge that she&#x27;s been fighting with her father nor with the knowledge that her father is sick, instead, it&#x27;s at his death and with their reconciliation. This is usually the end of an arc but here, it&#x27;s used as the springboard for her own development and it gives us two of this episode&#x27;s best scenes.&quot;

<text>Jacob&#x27;s Ladder () is a ladder or staircase leading to Heaven that was featured in a dream the Biblical Patriarch Jacob had during his flight from his brother Esau in the Book of Genesis (chapter 28).

The significance of the dream has been debated, but most interpretations agree that it identified Jacob with the obligations and inheritance of the people chosen by God, as understood in Abrahamic religions.

==Biblical narrative==
The description of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder appears in Genesis 28:10–19:

==Judaism==

The classic Torah commentaries offer several interpretations of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder. In &quot;Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot; 35:6-10, the ladder signified the four exiles the Jewish people would suffer before the coming of the messiah. First, the angel representing the Neo-Babylonian Empire climbed &quot;up&quot; 70 rungs and then fell &quot;down&quot;: a reference to the 70-year Babylonian exile. Then, the angel representing the exile of the Achaemenid Empire went up several steps and fell, as did the angel representing the exile of Greece (the Hellenistic period, Ptolemaic Kingdom, and the Seleucid Empire). Only the fourth angel, who represented the final exile of the Roman Empire, called &quot;Edom&quot; (whose guardian angel was Esau himself), kept climbing higher and higher into the clouds. Jacob feared that his children would never be free of Esau&#x27;s domination, but God assured him that at the End of Days, Edom too would fall.

Another interpretation of the ladder keys into the fact that the angels first &quot;ascended&quot; and then &quot;descended&quot;. The Midrash explains that Jacob, as a holy man, was always accompanied by angels. When he reached the border of the land of Canaan (the future Land of Israel), the angels who were assigned to the Holy Land returned to Heaven and the angels assigned to other lands came down to meet Jacob. When Jacob returned to Canaan, he was greeted by the angels who were assigned to the Holy Land.

Yet another interpretation is that the place at which Jacob stopped for the night was, in reality, Moriah, the future home of the Temple in Jerusalem, which was considered to be the &quot;bridge&quot; between Heaven and Earth. The ladder therefore signifies the &quot;bridge&quot; between Heaven and Earth. Moreover, the ladder alludes to the giving of the Torah as another connection between Heaven and Earth. In this interpretation, it is also significant that the word for &quot;ladder&quot; () and the name for the mountain on which the Torah was given, () have the same Gematria.

The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo, born in Alexandria, ( ) presents his allegorical interpretation of the ladder in the first book of his . There, he gives four interpretations, which are not mutually exclusive:

* The angels represent souls descending to and ascending from bodies (some consider this to be Philo&#x27;s most explicit reference to the doctrine of reincarnation).
* In the second interpretation, the ladder is the human soul, and the angels are God&#x27;s &quot;logoi&quot;, pulling the soul up in distress and descending in compassion.
* In the third view, the dream depicts the ups and downs of the life of the &quot;practiser&quot; (of virtue vs. sin).
* Finally, the angels represent the continually changing affairs of humankind.

The narrative of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder was used, shortly after the destruction of the Second Temple in the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), as the basis for the pseudepigraphic &quot;Ladder of Jacob&quot;. This writing, preserved only in Old Church Slavonic, interprets the experience of Patriarchs in the context of Merkabah mysticism.

A hilltop overlooking the Israeli settlement of Beit El north of Jerusalem, believed by some to be the site of Jacob&#x27;s dream, is a tourist destination during the holiday of Sukkot.

==Christianity==

Jesus said in John 1:51, &quot;And he saith unto him, &#x27;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see Heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.&#x27;&quot; This statement has been interpreted as associating Jesus with the ladder in that Jesus bridges the gap between Heaven and Earth. Jesus presents himself as the direction to which the ladder points. As Jacob saw the reunion of Heaven and Earth in a dream, Jesus brought this reunion—metaphorically the ladder—into reality. Adam Clarke, an early 19th-century Methodist theologian and Bible scholar, elaborates:

The theme of a ladder to Heaven is often used by the Church Fathers. Irenaeus, in the second century, describes the Christian Church as the &quot;ladder of ascent to God&quot;.

In the third century, Origen explains that there are two ladders in the life of a Christian: the ascetic ladder that the soul climbs on Earth, by way of—and resulting in—an increase in virtue, and the soul&#x27;s travel after death, climbing up the heavens toward the light of God.

In the fourth century, Gregory of Nazianzus wrote of ascending Jacob&#x27;s ladder by successive steps toward excellence, interpreting the ladder as an ascetic path. At the same time, Gregory of Nyssa narrated that Moses climbed l Jacob&#x27;s ladder to reach the heavens, where he entered a remade tabernacle; thus giving the ladder an apparent mystical meaning. The ascetic interpretation is found also in John Chrysostom, who wrote:


Jacob&#x27;s ladder as an analogy for a spiritually ascetic life enjoyed wide influence thanks to the classical work &quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot; by John Climacus. As such, the Carthusian monk Guigo II used it as inspiration for his description of the steps of the &quot;Lectio Divina&quot;, and the contemporary philosopher Peter Kreeft used it in his apologetics.

Jacob&#x27;s ladder is depicted on the facade of Bath Abbey in England, with angels climbing up and down ladders on either side of the main window on the west front.

== Islam ==
In Islam, Jacob () is revered as a prophet and patriarch. Muslim scholars drew a parallel between Jacob&#x27;s vision of the ladder and Muhammad&#x27;s event of the Miʿrāj. The ladder of Jacob was interpreted to be one of the many symbols of God, and many see Jacob&#x27;s Ladder as representing in its form the essence of Islam, which emphasizes following the &quot;straight path&quot;. The twentieth-century scholar Martin Lings described the significance of the ladder in the Islamic mystic perspective:

<doc id="555158" wikidata="Q6029191" url="?curid=555158" title="Infection (Babylon 5)">
<text>&quot;Infection&quot; is the fourth episode of the first season of the science fiction television series, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. &quot;Infection&quot; was the first script written for a regular &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode, and involves the arrival aboard the station of an extremely powerful ancient bio-weapon created by the Ikarrans, a long-extinct alien race.

==Plot==
Dr Vance Hendricks, a former college lecturer of Dr Franklin, visits him while he is checking on the cause of recent death of a Babylon 5 customs worker. Hendricks tells Franklin that while excavating the long-dead planet Ikarra VII for the corporation Interplanetary Expeditions, they had come across some artifacts that they determined were organic in nature, and something that humanity has been trying to develop themselves. Hendricks has Nelson, his assistant, bring the artifacts in, but Franklin expresses concern that they have not been properly put through quarantine; Hendricks assures him that they were processed prior to arriving on the station. As Nelson prepares the artifacts for examination, he is hit with an energy surge emanating from one of the artifacts. Over the next several hours, his body starts transforming, and unseen by the others, takes one of the devices and attaches it to himself.

The station staff, still investigating the sudden death of the customs worker, start to detect energy spikes on the station. Franklin and Hendricks realize that the Ikarra artifacts have infected Nelson and are transforming him into a weapon. Franklin studies the remaining artifacts to learn that the Ikarran people had developed these bio-weapons to fend off invaders to their planets, telling them protect the planet from anyone that was not a &quot;pure&quot; Ikarran. While the weapons held off the invaders, this instruction caused the weapons to turn on the Ikarrans since there was no such thing as a &quot;pure&quot; Ikarran. Nelson has now been transformed into one of these weapons, and will rampage through Babylon 5, gaining power over time.

Franklin explains the situation to Commander Sinclair while the station is being put into lockdown. Sinclair decides to face the weapon alone, explaining how they had wiped out their creators because they could not determine what a pure Ikarran was. The weapon pulls off the device from its armor and crushes it before collapsing, returning Nelson back to normal. Back in medbay, Franklin assures Nelson is fine, but confronts Hendricks knowing that he had instructed Nelson to smuggle the Ikarra artifacts aboard and that Nelson had deliberately killed the customs worker to do so. Hendricks is arrested, while EarthForce personnel arrive to acquire the weapons for their own bioweapons division.

Security Chief Michael Garibaldi confronts Sinclair about recklessly risking his life for the third time this year, saying that a lot of people who fought in the war came out without a purpose – looking for something worth dying for because they cannot find something worth living for.

An ISN news reporter finally gets the interview with Sinclair she had been waiting for, asking him whether – with what he&#x27;s been through – humanity&#x27;s continued presence in space is worth the effort. He replies that, when one day the sun will grow cold and go out, all of humanity&#x27;s achievements and culture would end, unless humanity manages to go to the stars first.

==Writing==
Straczynski, who wrote this episode first out of all the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; scripts, felt that the episode was possibly the weakest episode in the season. As nearly a year had passed since the pilot episode had been filmed, he felt it was difficult to find the &quot;fingerprints&quot; of the characters again. Straczynski writes, &quot;As on show, it takes a while to get up to speed once you hit series. That was the real problem, and there wasn&#x27;t any real way to get past it except to write it, re-acquaint myself with the characters, and move on. I probably would have opted out of doing it had we had more scripts on hand, but we didn&#x27;t. And oddly, many on the production team the script quite a lot, and kept saying it had to be done.&quot;

Regarding Garibaldi confronting Sinclair, Straczynski recalled that people were startled by the scene, &quot;Normally you don&#x27;t ask the hero that question: what do you do it? He didn&#x27;t have a good answer.&quot; O&#x27;Hare commented, &quot;At that time in my life I was going through some particular things that were not related to the show at all, other parts of my life, in which I was very much looking for something to believe in. So much that I did believe in had disappointed me, so I identified with someone who&#x27;s looking for something with some honor to it and was willing to risk his life over that.&quot;

Concerning &quot;racial cleansing&quot;, Straczynski made a comparison with the McCarthy Hearings where there was an obsession with communists controlling the state, and in pursuing this, they themselves became the controlling interests which they feared: &quot;No single race is one hundred percent pure of anything. There is a certain logic when he [Sinclair] says, &#x27;When you become obsessed with the enemy, you become the enemy.&#x27;

===Story arc significance===
Straczynski wrote, concerning Sinclair&#x27;s search for a reason to live, that it would tie in with his eventual destiny which would be revealed in Season 3, &quot;He was someone casting about for a reason to live, and eventually he would find that: it would take him a thousand years of time travel to do it but he would eventually find that.&quot;

Ensley Guffey and Dale Koontz note that one of the story arc seeds introduced in the episode is ISN, the Interstellar News Network, which will become important later in the series, as Straczynski highlights the tension between a free press and media which is intrusive. Also introduced is Interplanetary Expeditions (IPX) – a corporation which aims to exploit archaeological alien technologies – which will reappear several times during the series. The other seeds in the episode are in the further development of the characters of Sinclair, Franklin and Garibaldi.

==Production==
===Cast and filming===
This episode was the first Season 1 episode to be filmed – as it was the easiest one to shoot – in the Babylonian Productions premises, which was being converted from a warehouse into a studio.

Richard Biggs, who played a significant role in the episode as Dr Franklin, said, &quot;It was terrible... I was the new kid on the block on a Friday night. It was the last scene of the day. Everyone was under a lot of pressure. I had six lines on the Observation Deck, a lot of techno mumbo jumbo, and I hit my mark, and &quot;sixteen&quot; takes later they finally got it. I remember Michael O&#x27;Hare coming to me after sixteen takes: he patted me on the back and said (in a sarcastic tone), &#x27;Welcome to &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.&#x27; &quot;

Vance Hendricks was played by Scottish actor David McCallum, who is known for his portrayal of Soviet agent Kuryakin in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; Biggs recalled, &quot;He was a quiet man... He&#x27;d come to my trailer and say, &#x27;How about this?&#x27; or &#x27;How about that?&#x27; ... I wanted to point out that relationship. The characters were old friends–he was a teacher of mine–and I would have liked to have investigated those relations a little bit more.&quot;

Vance&#x27;s assistant, Nelson Drake, was played by Marshall Teague, who would later in the series play the recurring character Ta&#x27;Lon. At the end of the series, Ta&#x27;Lon would take over from G&#x27;Kar as Narn ambassador to Babylon 5. Makeup designer Everett Burrell recalled the department dressing Teague up in the suit from the episode:

===Visual effects and sound===
For its visual effects scenes, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pioneered the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) scenes – instead of using more expensive physical models – in a television series. This also enabled motion effects which are difficult to create using models, such as the rotation of fighter craft along multiple axes, or the rotation and banking of a virtual camera. The visual effects were created by Foundation Imaging using 24 Commodore Amiga 2000 computers with Lightwave 3D software and Video Toaster cards, 16 of which were dedicated to rending each individual frame of CGI, with each frame taking on average 45 minutes to render. In-house resource management software managed the workload of the Amiga computers to ensure that no machine was left idle during the image rendering process.

The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; makeup department involved in this episode – consisting of Everett Burrell, Greg Funk, Mary Kay Morse, Ron Pipes and John Vulich – would win the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for the next episode, &quot;The Parliament of Dreams&quot;.

Music for the title sequence and the episode was provided by the series&#x27; composer, Christopher Franke. Franke developed themes for each of the main characters, the station, for space in general, and for the alien races, endeavoring to carry a sense of the character of each race.

==Commentary and reviews==
&quot;A Dream Given Form: The Unofficial Guide to the Universe of Babylon 5&quot; comments on the interesting nature of this episode&#x27;s monster-of-the-week format, in that one of the monsters is the press, embodied by abrasive ISN reporter Mary Ann Cramer, and the ISN flying drone cameras. The authors note the development of the characters of Franklin, Sinclair and Garibaldi. Franklin is depicted as a workaholic. Garibaldi is revealed as having been fired five times in different jobs for unspecified personal reasons, with the ISN reporter saying that Babylon 5 was his last chance to make good. Sinclair is called out by Garibaldi for again recklessly risking his life, as if trying to prove himself. Garibaldi suspects it is related to Sinclair&#x27;s PTSD, one of the first occasions where PTSD and battle stress were elements in science fiction television. The authors continue, &quot;At the end of &#x27;Infection&#x27;, the viewer is left with three dedicated, talented men whose heroism is matched by their frailty, and with an early education in Straczynski&#x27;s own mastery of character as a driving force of storytelling. In &quot;Babylon 5&quot; the stories are &#x27;real&#x27; because the characters are.

Rowan Kaiser, writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, writes that, despite the poor plot, &#x27;Infection&#x27; manages to salvage itself by the end of the episode, with a few defining character moments. He points out the scene where Garibaldi confronts Sinclair about his over-willingness to risk his life: I think they&#x27;re looking for something worth dying for because it&#x27;s easier than finding something worth living for.&#x27; It&#x27;s not just an examination of the protagonist&#x27;s motivations, it&#x27;s also a reminder of just how bad The Battle Of The Line was, and how little we know about it.&quot;
Kaiser also highlights out the scene where Dr Franklin and Ivanova discuss the rising xenophobic sentiment on Earth, followed by a confirmation of their fears: EarthForce security arrives to confiscate the organic weaponry for its own bioweapons division. Kaiser writes, &quot;Even though &#x27;Infection&#x27; is a &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like episode, with a patriarchal captain solving a violent situation through diplomacy and application of logic, there’s still a moment where &quot;Babylon 5&quot; builds its darker, more serialized universe a tiny bit.&quot;

Elias Rosner, writing in &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, also points out the scene where Garibaldi calls out Sinclair on his death wish, as a &quot;great, small moment of characterization.&quot; He writes, &quot;While initially it didn&#x27;t seem all that out of the ordinary, having [Garibaldi] vocalize it reframes these earlier actions... [It] wasn&#x27;t telegraphed as a, this is a problem, but instead stewed in the background and only someone who knows Sinclair for a long time, would have picked up on it.&quot;

Rosner sums up, &quot;The politics of Earth start to catch up to Sinclair, a weapon based in eugenics is unleashed, and the corporations rear their ugly head. Welcome my friends. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.&quot;

<doc id="555163" wikidata="Q4903554" url="?curid=555163" title="Bicentennial Minutes">
<text>Bicentennial Minutes was a series of short educational American television segments commemorating the bicentennial of the American Revolution. The segments were produced by the CBS Television Network and broadcast nightly from July 4, 1974, until December 31, 1976. (The series was originally slated to end on July 4, 1976, but was extended to the end of the year, airing a total of 912 episodes.) The segments were sponsored by Shell Oil Company, then later by Raid from July 1976 onward.

==Description==

The series was created by Ethel Winant and Lewis Freedman of CBS, who had overcome the objections of network executives who considered it to be an unworthy use of program time. The producer of the series was Paul Waigner, the executive producer was Bob Markell, and the executive story editor and writer was Bernard Eismann from 1974 to 1976. He was followed by Jerome Alden. Associate producer Meryle Evans researched the historical facts for the broadcasts. In 1976, the series received an Emmy Award in the category of Special Classification of Outstanding Program and Individual Achievement. It also won a Special Christopher Award in 1976.

The videotaped segments were each one minute long and were broadcast each night during prime time hours, generally at approximately 8:27 or 8:57 P.M. Eastern time. The format of the segments did not change, although each segment featured a different narrator, often a CBS network television star. The narrator, after introducing himself or herself, would say &quot;Two hundred years ago today...&quot; and describe a historical event or personage prominent on that particular date two hundred years before and during the American Revolution. The segment would close with the narrator saying, &quot;I&#x27;m (his/her name), and that&#x27;s the way it was.&quot; This was an offhand reference to the close of the weeknight CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, who always ended each news telecast by saying, &quot;And that&#x27;s the way it is.&quot;

The &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; on July 3, 1976, was narrated by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. The &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; on July 4, 1976, was narrated by First Lady Betty Ford. The final &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot;, broadcast on December 31, 1976, was narrated by President Gerald Ford (his was also the longest &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot;). After the series ended, the time slot of the &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; came to be occupied by a brief synopsis of news headlines (&quot;Newsbreak&quot;) read by a CBS anchor.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; achieved a high cultural profile during its run and was widely referenced and parodied. For example, in the &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;Mike&#x27;s Move&quot; (originally broadcast on February 2, 1976), the character Mike Stivic responded to a typical monologue by his father-in-law Archie Bunker about the history of American immigration and the meaning of the Statue of Liberty with the sarcastic comment: &quot;I think we just heard Archie Bunker&#x27;s Bicentennial Minute.&quot; Another Norman Lear–produced sitcom, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, featured series star Redd Foxx parodying the &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot;.

Country music also used the &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; as a source of humor. The long-running television program &quot;Hee Haw&quot; parodied &quot;Bicentennial Minutes&quot; as &quot;About 200 Years Ago&quot;, with musician Grandpa Jones (wearing a mockery of a tri-cornered hat) giving a weekly monologue of humorously fractured historical &quot;facts&quot;, about figures from the American Revolution and the colonial era. These ended with Jones saying &quot;That&#x27;s the way it was, about 200 years ago... enh, more or less,&quot; and shrugging at the camera. The radio program &quot;American Country Countdown&quot; had a similar feature, delivered by then-&quot;ACC&quot; host Don Bowman.

A sketch on &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot; aired in early 1976 featured guest star Jim Nabors portraying British King George III, offering a comic rebuttal to the always pro–American Revolution &quot;Bicentennial Minutes&quot;. &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; with Harvey Korman and Tim Conway did a comic parody. The character Brenda Morgenstern (Julie Kavner) refers to the Bicentennial Minutes in the &quot;Rhoda&quot; episode &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Tell Her, I Will,&quot; broadcast in December 1975. CBS daytime game show &quot;Match Game&quot; had questions posed to contestants in this form as well throughout 1975 and 1976. Panelist Charles Nelson Reilly makes a joke that a moment on the New Year&#x27;s Eve 1976 episode of &quot;Match Game 76&quot; is &quot;the last one, thank god.&quot;

In the February 24, 1975 episode of &quot;Maude&quot; &quot;Walter&#x27;s Pride&quot;, when Walter gives Maude a list of reasons for why she cannot mortgage the house to save his business, Maude responds &quot;...I didn&#x27;t ask for your Bicentennial Minute!&quot;

On the April 24, 1976 episode of the NBC show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, host Raquel Welch appears in a sketch entitled Bisexual Minutes. Wearing a bicentennial themed bikini she announces, &quot;Good evening. I&#x27;m Gore Vidal.&quot; Welch had previously appeared in the 1970 film &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; which was based on the 1968 novel of the same name by Vidal, a noted bisexual.

In an episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, Arthur briefly references the &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; by saying how in 1976 he remembers &quot;throwing a pair of glasses at the TV during a particularly offensive Bicentennial Minute!&quot;
