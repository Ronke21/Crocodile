<text>Angmering is a village and civil parish between Littlehampton and Worthing in West Sussex on the southern edge of the South Downs National Park, England. About two-thirds of the parish (mostly north of the A27 road) fall within the park. It is north of the English Channel, and Worthing and Littlehampton are to the east and west respectively. It has been inhabited since the Bronze Age (visible remains of an ancient hill fort can be seen on nearby Highdown Hill) and there are the remains of a Roman Villa and bath house.

In 1976, Angmering was twinned with the Normandy town of Ouistreham on the &quot;Riva-Bella&quot;, the location of the World War II Normandy landings&#x27; Sword Beach.

Angmering railway station is mile from the village centre, straddling the boundaries of Angmering and East Preston.

==Etymology==
The name Angmering probably derives from a Saxon farming settlement of about 600AD. It is thought that the original name was Angenmaering, meaning Angenmaer&#x27;s people.

Various name changes took place over the centuries and these included Angemeringatun, Angmerengatum, Angemaeringum, Angemeringe, Aingmarying, Angmarrying, Angemare and Ameringe. Towards the end of the 9th century Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, bequeathed to his kinsman Osferthe ‘... Angmerengatum and the land that thereto longyth’.

==History==
A large Roman villa was discovered nearby and part-excavated in the 1930s. The excavation was mainly centred on a large bath house complex comprising at least eight rooms. It may have been occupied by an important Roman citizen or a member of the Romano-British aristocracy, like the palace at Fishbourne, and dates from the same period of 65–75AD.

==Demography==
With the recent development of the Bramley Green site, an influx of new residents has brought Angmering&#x27;s electoral ward&#x27;s resident population at the 2011 census to 7,788. In 2001 the population was 5,639, illustrating the 38.1 per cent increase in the village&#x27;s population over the previous decade or so. By 2023, the population had grown to about 10,100.

===Ethnicity===
According to the Office for National Statistics based on the 2011 census 97.6 per cent of the 7,788 population of Angmering were white with 94.3 per cent being white British, 0.7 per cent white Irish and 2.6 per cent identifying as white Other. 2.4 percent of Angmering&#x27;s residents are from a black or minority ethnic background.

===Religion===
According to the 2011 census, the largest religious grouping is Christians (66 per cent), followed by those of no religion (25.2 per cent). Angmering has a 12th-century Anglican church, St Margaret&#x27;s (re-built by Samuel Sanders Teulon in 1852 and reordered in 2009), a small Catholic congregation centred on St Wilfred&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, and a Baptist church.

==Geography==
The parish is about seven miles (10 km) long (from north to south) and two miles (3  km) wide. Its roots stretch back to the Bronze Age and it is also the site of a substantial Roman villa.

At the top of Angmering is Highdown Hill, a National Trust property with free access for walks and picnics on the smooth grass near the still-visible slopes of a former chalk quarry.

The village has three schools, several small shops, a post office and many historic houses from the 15th century onwards. It is in a semi-rural area with many farms. It has had various housing developments in the area. Previously it was the most populous area of it’s old parliamentary constituency, however that has since changed in accordance with the boundary review in 2023 that lead to the Angmering and Findon ward being given to the Worthing West constituency. Angmering is in a unique position of being a part of the Worthing West constituency, but falling under Arun District Council; most of the constituency falls under Adur and Worthing Council.

==Sport==
Angmering is home to Worthing Rugby Football Club, a national level professional rugby club which occupies extensive grounds in the east of the village. Angmering Football Club play their home games at the Recreation Field in Decoy Drive. They play in the West Sussex Football League.

==Notable inhabitants==
Childhood home of Abbess Katherine Palmer (d. 1576) and Thomas Palmer (d 22 August 1553) soldier and courtier executed for his support of Lady Jane Grey in the succession crisis of 1553.

The village was the birthplace of Tom Oliver, who, after adding an l to his name to become Olliver, became the winning rider of the 1842, 1843 and 1853 Grand Nationals. Impresario Lord Bernard Delfont and record producer Norman Newell have lived in Angmering. The actor and singer Stanley Holloway lived in the parish of East Preston (Angmering-on-Sea) with his wife before his death in 1982.

Portrait artist Juliet Pannett (1911-2005) and her family lived in Angmering from the mid-1960s until 2004.

==Twinning==
Since 1976, Angmering has been twinned with the coastal French town of Ouistreham in the Calvados department of Normandy.

<doc id="543033" wikidata="Q742637" url="?curid=543033" title="Denitrification">
<text>Denitrification is a microbially facilitated process where nitrate (NO3−) is reduced and ultimately produces molecular nitrogen (N2) through a series of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products. Facultative anaerobic bacteria perform denitrification as a type of respiration that reduces oxidized forms of nitrogen in response to the oxidation of an electron donor such as organic matter. The preferred nitrogen electron acceptors in order of most to least thermodynamically favorable include nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) finally resulting in the production of dinitrogen (N2) completing the nitrogen cycle. Denitrifying microbes require a very low oxygen concentration of less than 10%, as well as organic C for energy. Since denitrification can remove NO3−, reducing its leaching to groundwater, it can be strategically used to treat sewage or animal residues of high nitrogen content. Denitrification can leak N2O, which is an ozone-depleting substance and a greenhouse gas that can have a considerable influence on global warming.

The process is performed primarily by heterotrophic bacteria (such as &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; and various pseudomonads), although autotrophic denitrifiers have also been identified (e.g., &quot;Thiobacillus denitrificans&quot;). Denitrifiers are represented in all main phylogenetic groups. Generally several species of bacteria are involved in the complete reduction of nitrate to N2, and more than one enzymatic pathway has been identified in the reduction process. The denitrification process does not only provide energy to the organism performing nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas, but also some anaerobic ciliates can use denitrifying endosymbionts to gain energy similar to the use of mitochondria in oxygen respiring organisms.

Direct reduction from nitrate to ammonium, a process known as [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium]] or DNRA, is also possible for organisms that have the nrf-gene. This is less common than denitrification in most ecosystems as a means of nitrate reduction. Other genes known in microorganisms which denitrify include &quot;nir&quot; (nitrite reductase) and &quot;nos&quot; (nitrous oxide reductase) among others; organisms identified as having these genes include &quot;Alcaligenes faecalis&quot;, &quot;Alcaligenes xylosoxidans&quot;, many in the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Bradyrhizobium japonicum&quot;, and &quot;Blastobacter denitrificans&quot;.

== Overview ==

=== Half reactions ===
Denitrification generally proceeds through some combination of the following half reactions, with the enzyme catalyzing the reaction in parentheses:
* NO3− + 2 H+ + 2 e− → − + H2O (Nitrate reductase)
* − + 2 H+ + e− → NO + H2O (Nitrite reductase)
* 2 NO + 2 H+ + 2 e− → + H2O (Nitric-oxide reductase)
* + 2 H+ + 2 e− → + H2O (Nitrous-oxide reductase)
The complete process can be expressed as a net balanced redox reaction, where nitrate (NO3−) gets fully reduced to dinitrogen (N2):
* 2 NO3− + 10 e− + 12 H+ → N2 + 6 H2O

=== Conditions of denitrification ===
In nature, denitrification can take place in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Typically, denitrification occurs in anoxic environments, where the concentration of dissolved and freely available oxygen is depleted. In these areas, nitrate (NO3−) or nitrite (−) can be used as a substitute terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen (O2), a more energetically favourable electron acceptor. Terminal electron acceptor is a compound that gets reduced in the reaction by receiving electrons. Examples of anoxic environments can include soils, groundwater, wetlands, oil reservoirs, poorly ventilated corners of the ocean and seafloor sediments.

Furthermore, denitrification can occur in oxic environments as well. High activity of denitrifiers can be observed in the intertidal zones, where the tidal cycles cause fluctuations of oxygen concentration in sandy coastal sediments. For example, the bacterial species &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; engages in denitrification under both oxic and anoxic conditions simultaneously. Upon oxygen exposure, the bacteria is able to utilize nitrous oxide reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of denitrification. Aerobic denitrifiers are mainly Gram-negative bacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria. Enzymes NapAB, NirS, NirK and NosZ are located in the periplasm, a wide space bordered by the cytoplasmic and the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria.

A variety of environmental factors can influence the rate of denitrification on an ecosystem-wide scale. For example, temperature and pH have been observed to impact denitrification rates. In the bacterial species, &quot;Pseudomonas mandelii,&quot; expression of denitrifying genes was reduced at temperatures below 30 °C and a pH below 5, while activity was largely unaffected between a pH of 6–8. Organic carbon as an electron donor is a common limiting nutrient for denitrification as observed in benthic sediments and wetlands. Nitrate and oxygen can also be potential limiting factors for denitrification, although the latter only has an observed limiting effect in wet soils. Oxygen likely affects denitrification in multiple ways—because most denitrifiers are facultative, oxygen can inhibit rates, but it can also stimulate denitrification by facilitating nitrification and the production of nitrate. In wetlands as well as deserts, moisture is an environmental limitation to rates of denitrification.

Additionally, environmental factors can also influence whether denitrification proceeds to completion, characterized by the complete reduction of NO3− to N2 rather than releasing N2O as an end product. Soil pH and texture are both factors that can moderate denitrification, with higher pH levels driving the reaction more to completion. Nutrient composition, particularly the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, is a strong contributor to complete denitrification, with a 2:1 ratio of C:N being able to facilitate full nitrate reduction regardless of temperature or carbon source. Copper, as a co-factor for nitrite reductase and nitrous-oxide reductase, also promoted complete denitrification when added as a supplement. Besides nutrients and terrain, microbial community composition can also affect the ratio of complete denitrification, with prokaryotic phyla Actinomycetota and Thermoproteota being responsible for greater release of N2 than N2O compared to other prokaryotes.

Denitrification can lead to a condition called isotopic fractionation in the soil environment. The two stable isotopes of nitrogen, 14N and 15N are both found in the sediment profiles. The lighter isotope of nitrogen, 14N, is preferred during denitrification, leaving the heavier nitrogen isotope, 15N, in the residual matter. This selectivity leads to the enrichment of 14N in the biomass compared to 15N. Moreover, the relative abundance of 14N can be analyzed to distinguish denitrification apart from other processes in nature.

==Use in wastewater treatment==

Denitrification is commonly used to remove nitrogen from sewage and municipal wastewater. It is also an instrumental process in constructed wetlands and riparian zones for the prevention of groundwater pollution with nitrate resulting from excessive agricultural or residential fertilizer usage.
Wood chip bioreactors have been studied since the 2000s and are effective in removing nitrate from agricultural run off and even manure.

Reduction under anoxic conditions can also occur through process called anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox):

:NH4+ + NO2− → N2 + 2 H2O

In some wastewater treatment plants, compounds such as methanol, ethanol, acetate, glycerin, or proprietary products are added to the wastewater to provide a carbon and electron source for denitrifying bacteria. The microbial ecology of such engineered denitrification processes is determined by the nature of the electron donor and the process operating conditions. Denitrification processes are also used in the treatment of industrial wastewater. Many denitrifying bioreactor types and designs are available commercially for the industrial applications, including Electro-Biochemical Reactors (EBRs), membrane bioreactors (MBRs), and moving bed bioreactors (MBBRs).

Aerobic denitrification, conducted by aerobic denitrifiers, may offer the potential to eliminate the need for separate tanks and reduce sludge yield. There are less stringent alkalinity requirements because alkalinity generated during denitrification can partly compensate for the alkalinity consumption in nitrification.

==Non-biological denitrification==

A variety of non-biological methods can remove nitrate. These include methods that can destroy nitrogen compounds, such as chemical and electrochemical methods, and those that selectively transfer nitrate to a concentrated waste stream, such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis. Chemical removal of nitrate can occur through advanced oxidation processes, although it may produce hazardous byproducts. Electrochemical methods can remove nitrate by via a voltage applied across electrodes, with degradation usually occurring at the cathode. Effective cathode materials include transition metals, post transition metals, and semi-conductors like TiO2. Electrochemical methods can often avoid requiring costly chemical additives, but their effectiveness can be constrained by the pH and ions present. Reverse osmosis is highly effective in removing small charged solutes like nitrate, but it may also remove desirable nutrients, create large volumes of wastewater, and require increased pumping pressures. Ion exchange can selectively remove nitrate from water without large waste streams, but do require regeneration and may face challenges with absorption of undesired ions.

<doc id="543041" wikidata="Q1537791" url="?curid=543041" title="Oldsmobile Toronado">
<text>The Oldsmobile Toronado is a personal luxury car manufactured and marketed by the Oldsmobile division of General Motors from 1966 to 1992 over four generations. The Toronado was noted for its transaxle version of GM&#x27;s Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, making it the first U.S.-produced front-wheel drive automobile since the demise of the Cord 810/812 in 1937.

The Toronado used the GM E platform introduced by the rear-wheel drive Buick Riviera in 1963 and adopted for the front-wheel drive 1967 Cadillac Eldorado. The three models shared the E platform for most of the Toronado&#x27;s 26-year history.


==Etymology==
The name &quot;Toronado&quot; had no prior meaning and was originally selected for a 1963 Chevrolet show car.

==First generation (1966–1970)==
The Toronado began as a design painting by Oldsmobile stylist David North in 1962. His &quot;Flame Red Car&quot; was a compact sports/personal car never intended for production. A few weeks after the design was finished, however, Oldsmobile division was informed it would be permitted to build a personal car in the Riviera/Thunderbird class for the 1966 model year, and North&#x27;s design was selected. For production economy, the still-unnamed car was to share the so-called E-body shell with the redesigned 1966 Buick Riviera (then entering its second generation), which was substantially larger than North had envisioned. Despite the efforts of Oldsmobile and General Motors styling chief Bill Mitchell to put the car on the smaller A-body intermediate used by the Oldsmobile Cutlass, they were overruled for cost reasons.

Oldsmobile had been working on front-wheel drive since 1958, a project shepherded by engineer John Beltz (who originated the 4-4-2 and would later become head of the division). Although initially envisioned for the smaller F-85 line, its cost and experimental nature pushed the program towards a larger, more expensive car. Engineer F. J. Hooven of the Ford Motor Company, had patented a similar FWD layout, and Ford considered the design for the 1961 Ford Thunderbird. However, the capability to develop and engineer it on such short notice was doubtful. In 1956 Oldsmobile had also introduced a personal 2-door concept car called the Oldsmobile Golden Rocket that didn&#x27;t progress into production.

The unusual Toronado powertrain developed by Oldsmobile, called the Unitized Power Package (UPP), packaged a Rocket V8 and transmission into an engine bay no larger than one for a conventional rear-wheel drive car. During its seven-year development, UPP components were driven over 1.5 million test miles to verify their strength and reliability. They proved so well-built the UPP was employed basically unchanged in the 1970s GMC motorhome.

Firestone designed an 8.85&quot; x 15&quot; tire especially for the Toronado called the TFD (Toronado-Front-Drive) tire. It had a stiffer sidewall than normal, and the tread and stylishly thin white pin-stripe were also unique.

Oldsmobile engineers selected a conventional, though performance-boosted, Olds Super Rocket V8 rated at and of torque. It was an increase of over the Starfire 425, and an increase of over the standard 425 engine in the Ninety-Eight. The Toronado intake manifold&#x27;s unique shape was depressed to allow for engine hood clearance.

The Turbo-Hydramatic heavy-duty three-speed automatic transmission became available during development of the Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission&#x27;s torque converter was separated from its planetary gearset, with the torque converter driving the gearset through a wide silent chain-drive called Hy-Vo, riding on two sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM&#x27;s Hydra-Matic Division and Morse Chain Division of Borg-Warner. The chains were made from very strong hardened steel and required no tensioners or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a special machine at the factory. Although the rotational direction of the transmission gears had to be reversed, a large number of components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also eliminated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage. No manual transmission was ever contemplated because performance was adequate with the automatic transmission and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. The car&#x27;s time was clocked at 9.5 seconds.

The Toronado used a subframe that ended at the forward end of the rear suspension leaf springs, serving as an attachment point for the springs. It carried the powertrain, front suspension and floorpan, allowing greater isolation of road and engine harshness.

To fit into the tight space, Oldsmobile adopted torsion bars for the Toronado&#x27;s front suspension (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but still not up to Packard&#x27;s automatic ride leveling system), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it to act as a radius rod to control wheel movement).

Brakes were hydraulically operated drums, and were generally considered the Toronado&#x27;s weak link. As a rather heavy car, after several panic stops the brake drums would overheat, resulting in considerable fade and long stopping distances. The 1967 addition of vented front disc brakes as an option provided substantial improvement. The Toronado&#x27;s UPP enabled the interior to have a completely flat floor, but interior space (primarily rear seat headroom) was somewhat restricted by the fastback styling.

As with many coupes, the Toronado featured elongated doors to allow easier access for passengers entering the rear seats. Duplicate door-latch handles were even added at the rear of each door enabling back seat passengers to open the doors without having to reach over or around the front seat, a feature also available on the other two E-bodies, continuing until 1980 on the Eldorado. Options included headrests ($52) and a tilt-telescopic steering column.

Drivers faced a highly stylized steering wheel with a double-delta shaped horn ring which framed the view of an unusual &quot;slot-machine&quot; style speedometer, consisting of a stationary horizontal &quot;needle&quot; and a vertically rotating black drum on which the numerals were printed in white. The numerals descended behind the needle as the vehicle gained speed. All other gauges, indicators and controls were grouped within fairly easy reach of the driver.

Despite an average weight of , published performance test data shows the 1966 Toronado was capable of accelerating from in 7.5 seconds, and through the standing in 16.4 seconds at . It was also capable of a maximum speed of . Testers found the Toronado&#x27;s handling, despite its noticeable front weight bias and consequent understeer, was not substantially different from other full-size U.S. cars when driven under normal conditions. In fact, testers felt that the Toronado was more poised and responsive than other cars, and when pushed to the limits, exhibited superior handling characteristics, although it was essentially incapable of terminal oversteer.

The 1966 model was widely recognized as a step forward in design, gaining publicity for the division by winning several leading automotive awards, such as &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Car of the Year Award and &quot;Car Life&quot;″s Award for Engineering Excellence. It was also the second American car to ever be awarded recognition in Europe, as the third-place finisher at the European Car of the Year competition in 1966.

The Toronado sold reasonably well at introduction, with 40,963 produced for 1966. Some television commercials featured former NASA Project Mercury public affairs officer John &quot;Shorty&quot; Powers, Oldsmobile&#x27;s primary commercial spokesperson of the era, along with racing legend Bobby Unser driving the vehicle and commenting favorably on the Toronado&#x27;s handling.

Sales for the 1967 model, which was distinguished by a slight facelift, the addition of optional disc brakes, and a slightly softer ride, dropped by nearly half, to 22,062. A stereo tape player was optional. It would be 1971 before the Toronado matched its first-year sales volume.

In 1967, Cadillac adopted its own version of the UPP for the Cadillac Eldorado, using the Cadillac V8 engine. The Eldorado also shared the E-body shell with the Toronado and Riviera, but its radically different styling meant that the three cars did not look at all similar. Also, despite sharing the same platform as the Toronado and Eldorado, the Riviera retained its rear-wheel drive setup, and would not convert to front-wheel drive until the platform was downsized in 1979.

The first-generation Toronado persisted with the usual annual facelifts through 1970. Other than the brakes, the major changes were the replacement of the original V8 with the new  in 1968, rated at in standard form or with the W-34 option, revised rear quarter panels (with small fins to disguise the slope of the rear body in side view) in 1969, and the elimination of hidden headlights and the introduction of squared wheel arch bulges in 1970. An ignition lock was added in 1969.

Slight interior cosmetic changes were made for each new model year, and a full-length center console with floor-mounted shifter was available as an extra-cost option with the Strato bucket seats from 1968 to 1970, though few Toronados were so ordered. The vast majority of customers went for the standard Strato bench seat to take full advantage of the flatter floor resulting from the front-drive layout. The lack of a &quot;hump&quot; in the floor made three-abreast seating more comfortable than in rear-drive cars, as the center passengers both front and rear did not have to straddle one.

The firm suspension and thus the quality of the ride, was gradually softened through the years, hinting at what Toronado eventually would become in 1971. A heavy-duty suspension was an option on later first generation Toronados, which included the original torsion bar springs that were used on the 1966 model.

A special option code called W-34 was available on the 1968–70 Toronado. This option included a cold air induction system for the air cleaner, a special performance camshaft and a &quot;GT&quot; transmission calibrated for quick and firm up-shifts and better torque multiplication at . Dual exhaust outlets similar to the 1966–67 model years with cutouts in the bumper, were included with W-34. The standard models also had dual exhaust systems, but only a single somewhat hidden outlet running from the muffler exiting rearward on the right side. For 1970 only, the W-34 option also included special &quot;GT&quot; badges on the exterior of the car. The W-34 Toronado was capable of 0–60 mph in 7.5 seconds and the standing 1/4 mile in 15.7 seconds at .

==Second generation (1971–1978)==
With heavily revised styling from the first generation, the Toronado transitioned from a &quot;GT&quot;-style car into a more traditional luxury car. It was now more similar to the Cadillac Eldorado than the Buick Riviera (which would be redesigned in 1974, then again in 1977), with styling taking several cues from the 1967–1970 Eldorado. Sales increased dramatically. Front disc brakes became standard. The front end used a novel air induction system, splitting the airflow from below the headlights, in a &quot;bottom breather&quot; fashion. When United States Federal bumper standards were implemented, the front air intake was phased out for a conventional approach from below the bumper.

All overall dimensions of the 1971 Toronado were larger than previous models with wheelbase increased from 119 to , only less than the full-sized Delta 88. Additionally, the subframe design of first-generation Toronados was replaced by a separate body-on-frame similar to full-sized Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models. The front torsion bar suspension was retained, but the multi-leaf springs in the rear were replaced by coil springs. In addition, the Toronado introduced as a novelty what later became a federal mandate in a modified form, two high-mounted taillights above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin, the Riviera. These taillights mirrored brake and turn functions of the normal taillights, but not the nighttime taillights. A rear-wheel ABS became optional.

The 455 cubic-inch (7.46 L) Rocket V8 was carried over from previous models as the standard Toronado engine. The introduction of the second-generation Toronado coincided with the implementation of a GM corporate edict that took effect with the 1971 models; all engines had to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline to meet increasingly stringent Federal (and California) emission control regulations, which was achieved by reducing compression ratios. This was a first step toward the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975, which mandated the use of unleaded fuel. The 1971 Toronado&#x27;s 455 cubic-inch V8 (7.46 L) was rated at (down from 375 in 1970) with a compression ratio of 8.5:1 (down from 10.5:1 in 1970).

For 1972, the advertised rating for the 455 engine dropped to thanks to a switch in power measurement to &quot;net&quot; ratings which were measured as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emissions equipment attached. By 1976, the last year for the 455 engine in the Toronado, the net rating dropped to .

The 1971–1978 generation is mainly noted for the early use of two safety features that are now standard on all cars in the United States, the aforementioned high-mounted taillights (although a somewhat similar feature had appeared briefly as an option on the Ford Thunderbird in the late 1960s) and, from 1974 through 1976, the Toronado was part of GM&#x27;s first experimental production run of driver- and passenger-side airbags, which GM named the Air Cushion Restraint System. These Toronados used a unique steering wheel and were fitted with a knee blocker beneath the driver&#x27;s portion of the dashboard.

Styling/engineering highlights through the years included disc brakes with audible wear indicators for 1972, a federally mandated front bumper along with new vertical taillights in 1973, a stand-up hood ornament, 5 mph rear bumper and optional fixed rear side opera windows in 1974 and rectangular headlights in 1975.

The 1973 Toronado went on sale in September 1972 and has a combined fuel economy of between 8.5 and 10.9 miles per gallon. The 1975 through 1978 Toronados had a fuel tank that could hold 26 gallons of gasoline, whereas the 1973 Toronado had a 25.9 gallon capacity fuel tank with 250 horsepower and an axle ratio of 2.73:1. The 1973 Toronado was made from September 1972 to September 1973.

During most of the Toronado&#x27;s second-generation run, two interior trims were generally offered each year. The standard interior trim consisted of a choice of cloth or vinyl upholstery and a Custom Sport notchback bench seat with center armrest. An optional Brougham interior available in cloth, velour or vinyl trims included cut-pile carpeting, door-mounted courtesy lighting and a split 60/40 bench seat with armrest. From 1971 to 1973, the Toronado&#x27;s &quot;Command Center&quot; wrap-around instrument panel was similar to other full-sized Oldsmobiles featuring a large squared speedometer directly in front of the driver, heating/air conditioning and lights/wipers switches on the left hand side and the radio controls and cigar lighter on the right hand side. From 1974 to 1978, a flat instrument panel (again shared with Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models) was used that featured a horizontal sweep speedometer flanked by a &quot;Message Center&quot; of warning lights, fuel gauge and shift quadrant, with the other controls in the same locations as in previous years.

As befitting a luxury car, Toronados featured a long list of standard equipment that included Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes along with an electric clock, carpeting and deluxe wheel covers. Virtually all Toronados&#x27; were sold loaded with extra-cost options including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with 8-track tape player, power trunk release, vinyl roof, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks and six-way power seats. Power windows became standard equipment in 1975. A new feature in 1974 was a gauge that monitored if the driver was driving economically or not called the Fuel Economy Gauge which was a vacuum pressure gauge that would determine if the accelerator pedal was being pushed too hard.

The later years of this generation of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire &quot;bent-glass&quot; rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards at the touch of a button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable solution to the problem was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM&#x27;s more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astro roof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.

The running factory &quot;XSR&quot; prototype was documented as &quot;restored&quot; by Collectible Automobile Magazine in the late 1990s.

Also for 1977, the V8 was replaced by a smaller  engine (rated at 185HP/325 lb.ft.), due mainly to forthcoming government Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards (implemented beginning with the 1978 model year). In addition, the 1977 Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models, formerly the biggest cars in the Oldsmobile stable, were downsized. For two more model years, the Toronado would be the largest Oldsmobile, and, after the mid-sized Cutlass line&#x27;s downsizing for 1978, the Toronado looked hopelessly out of place in the lineup, given the industry-wide shift to smaller cars. Also in 1977, when Buick removed the Riviera from the E-body lineup and reassigned it to the B-body LeSabre bodyshell, this meant that all E-bodies would be front-wheel drive only.

This generation was probably helped in the sales race by the radical and controversial &quot;boat-tail&quot; design of the contemporary Buick Riviera, since during this period the Toronado outsold its Buick cousin for the first time. However, the higher-priced Cadillac Eldorado managed to outsell the Toronado in most of these years.

==Third generation (1979–1985)==
The third generation Toronado was substantially downsized, losing nearly and almost in length. Reflecting its length and wheelbase, it came equipped with the smaller Oldsmobile V8. The engine was rated at 170 HP/270 lb.ft. torque giving it a top speed of over and a acceleration time of 9.4 seconds. This was considered one of the faster times for that era.

A  V8 (140 HP) was introduced in 1980, and a larger version of the Buick V6 (125 HP) shared with the Riviera was made available from 1981 to 1984, but it proved unpopular due to its slow acceleration.

Also offered in these years was Oldsmobile&#x27;s new diesel V8, that is based on the division&#x27;s gasoline-powered V8, but with added block material. This engine was novel and economical, and sales were initially good. However, the diesel engine quickly acquired a terrible mechanical reputation, becoming a genuine black eye for Oldsmobile. Many cars which originally came diesel-equipped were eventually converted to gasoline engines when disgusted owners finally threw in the towel. The engine was revised through its life, which fixed many issues that hurt its reputation, but it was too late and the engine was eventually dropped.


The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission was standard equipment from 1979 to 1981 and replaced by the four-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 325-4L overdrive unit from 1982 to 1985. The 307 cubic-inch V8 (a smaller-displacement version of the 350 Rocket), was standard on 1985 Toronados.

Independent rear suspension (designed by Cadillac engineers) was adopted for the new car, which helped to increase usable rear-seat and trunk space in the smaller body, as well as improved handling over previous Toronados with no sacrifice in ride quality. Rear disc brakes were optional.

In addition to the base Toronado Brougham, various trim packages were available under the XSC (1980–81) and Caliente (1984–85) names were offered along with choices of velour, leather upholstery, even sueded leather inserts and digital instrumentation. The XSC offered individual front bucket seats, as opposed to the traditional split bench front seat usually installed. The third-generation of the Toronado was also made into a convertible by the American Sunroof Company, with a power-operated cloth top. Reclining backrests were an option.

This generation Toronado, along with its Riviera and Eldorado cousins, were the last body-on-frame, front wheel drive cars with longitudinally mounted V8 engines.

==Fourth generation (1986–1992)==
With a nearly 16% price increase over the 1985 model, the final generation Toronado made its debut in 1985 for the 1986 model year. It was smaller overall, moved from body-on-frame to unibody construction, and was the first Toronado since 1969 to feature hidden headlights. The Toronado&#x27;s previous longitudinally-mounted V8 engines were superseded by a single, transversely-mounted fuel-injected version of the Buick 231 cu in (3.8 L) V6. 

Inside, a new digital instrument panel and optional voice alert system were used. Standard seating was a cloth 60/40 bench with center armrest. Optional bucket seats were offered with a full-length center console and a horseshoe-like &quot;basket handle&quot; gear shift. Upholstery choices included cloth or leather.

Against predictions of sharp gasoline prices, prices fell dramatically. As a result, many traditional domestic car buyers chose to buy larger, less efficient cars in 1986. Along with its rebadged variants, the Eldorado and Riviera, the Toronado suffered a serious sales decline. Journalists cited factors including the downsizing, notable price increases, as well as styling that too closely followed less expensive, less-luxurious compacts at GM, notably the N-body Oldsmobile Calais, Buick Somerset, and Pontiac Grand Am.
In mid-1987, Oldsmobile attempted to bolster sagging Toronado sales by introducing a sportier model marketed as the Toronado Troféo, which featured standard leather bucket seats, faux dual exhaust, more-aggressive styling, and a stiffer suspension (the highly regarded corporate FE3 package, with retuned shocks, struts and other components).

For 1988, changes for the Troféo included new seats and monochromatic paint; both Toronado and Troféo used larger climate control buttons and rear three-point seatbelts. Additionally, power increased with the introduction of the new Buick LN3 V6 engine. Optional wire wheel covers were no longer offered. Toronado and Trofeo models included the FE3 suspension with standard aluminum wheels.

For model year 1989, the Troféo was no longer marketed as the Toronado. Options included the &quot;Visual Information Center&quot;: a dash-mounted touchscreen CRT that controlled the vehicle&#x27;s HVAC system, radio, trip computer and interface to the optional integrated hands-free cell phone. The Troféo also received standard anti-lock brakes, a new steering wheel with controls for radio and climate control, and standard bucket seats with console or an optional split-bench.

For 1990, the hood was the only carryover sheet metal as Oldsmobile designers redesigned the body, increasing the overall length by about , enlarging the trunk. A driver-side airbag was standard equipment. The 1991 models had increased horsepower, and remote keyless entry and anti-lock brakes were now standard. Ultrasuede upholstery was an option. The optional moonroof no longer required ordering bucket seats, however, a fully digital instrument cluster was now only available on Toronado models equipped with a front bench seat.


In 1992, General Motors (GM) and Avis Rent a Car pilot tested a GPS navigation system in select rental Troféo models equipped with the touchscreen at the Orlando International Airport in Florida. The pilot systems included the built-in cellular phone and a computer-synthesized voice guidance system. Named &quot;TravTek&quot;, the system was monitored by AAA via an antenna mounted on the car&#x27;s trunk, and included directions to AAA locations around the Orlando area.

1992 models again offered optional wire wheels and received a stiffer standard suspension, the formerly-optional FE3 package. Oldsmobile discontinued the Toronado and Troféo at the end of the 1992 model year, with the last Toronado rolling off the assembly line on May 28, 1992. The Toronado was ultimately replaced in the lineup in early 1994 by the Aurora sports sedan, which made its debut as a 1995 model and shared its platform with the eighth and final generation of the Buick Riviera.
==Variants==
===Jetway 707===
During the late 1960s (1968–1970), the only Oldsmobile professionally made into a limousine was the Toronado, known as the American Quality Coach (AQC) Jetway 707, with the 707 moniker a nod to the Boeing 707. The 707 rode on six wheels, and was 28 ft long with a 185-inch wheelbase. To capitalize on the aircraft theme, the passengers each sat on individual bucket seats. Between 52 and 150 were believed to have been built. A black one can be seen in a traffic scene in the 1976 film &quot;All the President’s Men&quot;, a white one can be seen parked in the 1977 film &quot;Billy Jack Goes To Washington&quot;, and a gray convertible version can be seen in the 1978 film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; as one of the main vehicles.
===67 X===
The 67 X (also Toronado 67X, Esso 67X) is a Canadian-built automobile, based on the Toronado, that was designed and manufactured by automobile customizer George Barris for Canada&#x27;s Expo 67, where they were raffled off in a contest sponsored by Esso. Only four of these vehicles were ever made, but they included swiveling seats, a sofa, and even a refrigeration unit, with an overall sleek-looking design. Commercials for this vehicle were aired in the Stanley Cup Playoffs final game between the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. In April 2009, one of these cars came up for auction on eBay.

<doc id="543048" wikidata="Q407280" url="?curid=543048" title="Cofactor (biochemistry)">
<text>A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound or metallic ion that is required for an enzyme&#x27;s role as a catalyst (a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction). Cofactors can be considered &quot;helper molecules&quot; that assist in biochemical transformations. The rates at which these happen are characterized in an area of study called enzyme kinetics. Cofactors typically differ from ligands in that they often derive their function by remaining bound.

Cofactors can be classified into two types: inorganic ions and complex organic molecules called coenzymes. Coenzymes are mostly derived from vitamins and other organic essential nutrients in small amounts. (Some scientists limit the use of the term &quot;cofactor&quot; for inorganic substances; both types are included here.)

Coenzymes are further divided into two types. The first is called a &quot;prosthetic group&quot;, which consists of a coenzyme that is tightly (or even covalently and, therefore, permanently) bound to a protein. The second type of coenzymes are called &quot;cosubstrates&quot;, and are transiently bound to the protein. Cosubstrates may be released from a protein at some point, and then rebind later. Both prosthetic groups and cosubstrates have the same function, which is to facilitate the reaction of enzymes and proteins. An inactive enzyme without the cofactor is called an apoenzyme, while the complete enzyme with cofactor is called a holoenzyme.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines &quot;coenzyme&quot; a little differently, namely as a low-molecular-weight, non-protein organic compound that is loosely attached, participating in enzymatic reactions as a dissociable carrier of chemical groups or electrons; a prosthetic group is defined as a tightly bound, nonpolypeptide unit in a protein that is regenerated in each enzymatic turnover.

Some enzymes or enzyme complexes require several cofactors. For example, the multienzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase at the junction of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle requires five organic cofactors and one metal ion: loosely bound thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), covalently bound lipoamide and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), cosubstrates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and coenzyme A (CoA), and a metal ion (Mg2+).

Organic cofactors are often vitamins or made from vitamins. Many contain the nucleotide adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as part of their structures, such as ATP, coenzyme A, FAD, and NAD+. This common structure may reflect a common evolutionary origin as part of ribozymes in an ancient RNA world. It has been suggested that the AMP part of the molecule can be considered to be a kind of &quot;handle&quot; by which the enzyme can &quot;grasp&quot; the coenzyme to switch it between different catalytic centers.

==Classification==
Cofactors can be divided into two major groups: organic cofactors, such as flavin or heme; and inorganic cofactors, such as the metal ions Mg2+, Cu+, Mn2+ and iron–sulfur clusters.

Organic cofactors are sometimes further divided into &quot;coenzymes&quot; and &quot;prosthetic groups&quot;. The term coenzyme refers specifically to enzymes and, as such, to the functional properties of a protein. On the other hand, &quot;prosthetic group&quot; emphasizes the nature of the binding of a cofactor to a protein (tight or covalent) and, thus, refers to a structural property. Different sources give slightly different definitions of coenzymes, cofactors, and prosthetic groups. Some consider tightly bound organic molecules as prosthetic groups and not as coenzymes, while others define all non-protein organic molecules needed for enzyme activity as coenzymes, and classify those that are tightly bound as coenzyme prosthetic groups. These terms are often used loosely.

A 1980 letter in &quot;Trends in Biochemistry Sciences&quot; noted the confusion in the literature and the essentially arbitrary distinction made between prosthetic groups and coenzymes group and proposed the following scheme. Here, cofactors were defined as an additional substance apart from protein and substrate that is required for enzyme activity and a prosthetic group as a substance that undergoes its whole catalytic cycle attached to a single enzyme molecule. However, the author could not arrive at a single all-encompassing definition of a &quot;coenzyme&quot; and proposed that this term be dropped from use in the literature.

==Inorganic cofactors==

===Metal ions===

Metal ions are common cofactors. The study of these cofactors falls under the area of bioinorganic chemistry. In nutrition, the list of essential trace elements reflects their role as cofactors. In humans this list commonly includes iron, magnesium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, and molybdenum. Although chromium deficiency causes impaired glucose tolerance, no human enzyme that uses this metal as a cofactor has been identified. Iodine is also an essential trace element, but this element is used as part of the structure of thyroid hormones rather than as an enzyme cofactor. Calcium is another special case, in that it is required as a component of the human diet, and it is needed for the full activity of many enzymes, such as nitric oxide synthase, protein phosphatases, and adenylate kinase, but calcium activates these enzymes in allosteric regulation, often binding to these enzymes in a complex with calmodulin. Calcium is, therefore, a cell signaling ion, and not usually considered a cofactor of the enzymes it regulates.

Other organisms require additional metals as enzyme cofactors, such as vanadium in the nitrogenase of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus &quot;Azotobacter&quot;, tungsten in the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the thermophilic archaean &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot;, and even cadmium in the carbonic anhydrase from the marine diatom &quot;Thalassiosira weissflogii&quot;.

In many cases, the cofactor includes both an inorganic and organic component. One diverse set of examples is the heme proteins, which consist of a porphyrin ring coordinated to iron.

===Iron–sulfur clusters===
Iron–sulfur clusters are complexes of iron and sulfur atoms held within proteins by cysteinyl residues. They play both structural and functional roles, including electron transfer, redox sensing, and as structural modules.

==Organic==
Organic cofactors are small organic molecules (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) that can be either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when it is difficult to remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. There is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are tightly bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.

Vitamins can serve as precursors to many organic cofactors (e.g., vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folic acid) or as coenzymes themselves (e.g., vitamin C). However, vitamins do have other functions in the body. Many organic cofactors also contain a nucleotide, such as the electron carriers NAD and FAD, and coenzyme A, which carries acyl groups. Most of these cofactors are found in a huge variety of species, and some are universal to all forms of life. An exception to this wide distribution is a group of unique cofactors that evolved in methanogens, which are restricted to this group of archaea.

===Vitamins and derivatives===
===Non-vitamins===
===Cofactors as metabolic intermediates===

Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are the loosely bound organic cofactors, often called coenzymes.

Each class of group-transfer reaction is carried out by a particular cofactor, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. An example of this are the dehydrogenases that use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a cofactor. Here, hundreds of separate types of enzymes remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ to NADH. This reduced cofactor is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that require electrons to reduce their substrates.

Therefore, these cofactors are continuously recycled as part of metabolism. As an example, the total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mole. This ATP is constantly being broken down into ADP, and then converted back into ATP. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75 kg. In typical situations, humans use up their body weight of ATP over the course of the day. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 1000 to 1500 times daily.

===Evolution===

Organic cofactors, such as ATP and NADH, are present in all known forms of life and form a core part of metabolism. Such universal conservation indicates that these molecules evolved very early in the development of living things. At least some of the current set of cofactors may, therefore, have been present in the last universal ancestor, which lived about 4 billion years ago.

Organic cofactors may have been present even earlier in the history of life on Earth. The nucleotide adenosine is a cofactor for many basic metabolic enzymes such as transferases. It may be a remnant of the RNA world. Adenosine-based cofactors may have acted as adaptors that allowed enzymes and ribozymes to bind new cofactors through small modifications in existing adenosine-binding domains, which had originally evolved to bind a different cofactor. This process of adapting a pre-evolved structure for a novel use is known as &quot;exaptation&quot;.

Prebiotic origin of coenzymes. Like amino acids and nucleotides, certain vitamins and thus coenzymes can be created under early earth conditions. For instance, vitamin B3 can be synthesized with electric discharges applied to ethylene and ammonia. Similarly, pantetheine (a vitamin B5 derivative), a precursor of coenzyme A and thioester-dependent synthesis, can be formed spontaneously under evaporative conditions. Other coenzymes may have existed early on Earth, such as pterins (a derivative of vitamin B9), flavins (FAD, flavin mononucleotide = FMN), and riboflavin (vitamin B2).

Changes in coenzymes. A computational method, IPRO, recently predicted mutations that experimentally switched the cofactor specificity of &quot;Candida boidinii&quot; xylose reductase from NADPH to NADH.

Evolution of enzymes without coenzymes. If enzymes require a co-enzyme, how does the coenzyme evolve? The most likely scenario is that enzymes can function initially without their coenzymes and later recruit the coenzyme, even if the catalyzed reaction may not be as efficient or as fast. Examples are Alcohol Dehydrogenase (coenzyme: NAD⁺), Lactate Dehydrogenase (NAD⁺), Glutathione Reductase (NADPH).

===History===

The first organic cofactor to be discovered was NAD+, which was identified by Arthur Harden and William Young 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a &quot;coferment&quot;. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. Other cofactors were identified throughout the early 20th century, with ATP being isolated in 1929 by Karl Lohmann, and coenzyme A being discovered in 1945 by Fritz Albert Lipmann.

The functions of these molecules were at first mysterious, but, in 1936, Otto Heinrich Warburg identified the function of NAD+ in hydride transfer. This discovery was followed in the early 1940s by the work of Herman Kalckar, who established the link between the oxidation of sugars and the generation of ATP. This confirmed the central role of ATP in energy transfer that had been proposed by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941. Later, in 1949, Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that NAD+ linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP.

==Protein-derived cofactors==
In a number of enzymes, the moiety that acts as a cofactor is formed by post-translational modification of a part of the protein sequence. This often replaces the need for an external binding factor, such as a metal ion, for protein function. Potential modifications could be oxidation of aromatic residues, binding between residues, cleavage or ring-forming. These alterations are distinct from other post-translation protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, methylation, or glycosylation in that the amino acids typically acquire new functions. This increases the functionality of the protein; unmodified amino acids are typically limited to acid-base reactions, and the alteration of resides can give the protein electrophilic sites or the ability to stabilize free radicals. Examples of cofactor production include tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), derived from two tryptophan side chains, and 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO), derived from an Ala-Ser-Gly motif. Characterization of protein-derived cofactors is conducted using X-ray crystallography and mass spectroscopy; structural data is necessary because sequencing does not readily identify the altered sites.

==Non-enzymatic cofactors==
The term is used in other areas of biology to refer more broadly to non-protein (or even protein) molecules that either activate, inhibit, or are required for the protein to function. For example, ligands such as hormones that bind to and activate receptor proteins are termed cofactors or coactivators, whereas molecules that inhibit receptor proteins are termed corepressors. One such example is the G protein-coupled receptor family of receptors, which are frequently found in sensory neurons. Ligand binding to the receptors activates the G protein, which then activates an enzyme to activate the effector. In order to avoid confusion, it has been suggested that such proteins that have ligand-binding mediated activation or repression be referred to as coregulators.

<text>The Wallaman Falls, a cascade and horsetail waterfall on the Stony Creek, is located in the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Wet Tropics in the locality of Wallaman, Shire of Hinchinbrook in the northern region of Queensland, Australia. The waterfall is notable for its main drop of , which makes it the country&#x27;s tallest single-drop waterfall. The pool at the bottom of the waterfall is deep. An estimated people visit the waterfall annually.

==Location and features==
The waterfall is situated in the Girringun National Park as it descends from the Atherton Tableland, where the Stony Creek, a tributary of the Herbert River, flows over an escarpment in the Seaview Range. The falls initially descend over a small number of cascades before the horsetail drop. In total, the falls descend over . Based on the falls&#x27; single-drop descent, the World Waterfall Database places Wallaman Falls at 294 in its world rankings.

The geological history of the formation may be traced back some 50 million years, when the uplift of the continental margin in the region created modern landforms. The Herbert River, which previously flowed west, began to cut through the terrain en route to its outflow in the Coral Sea. The gorge produced by this erosive action gradually retreated inland along the Herbert River&#x27;s course at a rate of per hundred years. The river&#x27;s tributaries were eventually left suspended by this action, forming their own gorges.

<doc id="543056" wikidata="Q6851576" url="?curid=543056" title="Miles Whitney Straight">
<text>The Miles M.11 Whitney Straight was a 1930s twin-seat cabin monoplane designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Miles Aircraft. It was named after Whitney Straight, a Grand Prix motor racing driver, aviator and businessman. The aircraft was the first to combine a side-by-side seating arrangement with an enclosed cockpit for the general aviation sector.

The Whitney Straight was developed after F.G. Miles and Straight recognised that they had similar ambitions to develop modern aircraft suited to flying clubs and private owners alike, and thus decided to collaborate on its production. On 14 May 1936, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight at Woodley Aerodrome; quantity production commenced shortly thereafter. Whitney Straights were used in various roles within the civil market, such as air racing and aerial topdressing.

Approaches were also made by Miles to introduce the Whitney Straight into the military market. While not selected as an army cooperation aircraft for the British Army in the pre-war years, numerous civil aircraft were impressed into military service during the Second World War, the type being largely operated as a communications aircraft. While production ended in 1937, several Whitney Straights remained in an airworthy condition into the twenty first century.

==Development==
During late 1935, the Grand Prix motor racing driver, aviator and businessman Whitney Straight was engaged in efforts to establish numerous flying clubs to server major British towns. As a part of his efforts to popularise aviation, Straight sought a modern aeroplane that would be best suited for both club flying and use by private owners; specifically, he desired the envisioned aircraft to be considerably faster that the slow moving biplanes that traditionally dominated the market. It was also desirable for such a plane to feature a side-by-side seating arrangement in an enclosed cockpit, rather than an open cockpit that necessitated the cumbersome use of speaking tubes, in addition to more general attributes such as being reasonably easy to handle, safe to fly, and economic to both maintain and operate.

By this point, F.G. Miles of Philips and Powis had already established a favourable reputation due to, amongst other feats, the company&#x27;s aircraft having been front runners in the King&#x27;s Cup Race, thus the company was viewed by Straight as a natural partner for his envisioned aircraft. Upon being approached by Straight, Miles concurred with his aims, thus the two decided to collaborate on the development and marketing of such an aircraft, which was designated as the &quot;M.11 Whitney Straight&quot;. Work on the project proceeded at a relatively rapid pace, enabling the first prototype (&quot;G-AECT&quot;) to conduct its maiden flight at Woodley Aerodrome on 14 May 1936. Initially piloted by F.G. Miles, the prototype demonstrated the design to already be fulfilling expectations, particularly in regards to its ease of flight and comfort, while also achieving a 50 per cent speed increase over its biplane contemporaries.

Having been sufficiently pleased with the first prototype&#x27;s early performance, quantity production of the Whitney Straight commenced as soon as possible, a state which was reportedly achieved by April 1936. Seeking to promote the type, F.G. Miles personally performed an intense tour around Europe to demonstrate and promote the Whitney Straight to potential customers; amongst the feats of the tour was a 17,000 ft flight above the Alps without the use of a supercharger-equipped engine. During April 1938, production of the type was terminated, by which point a total of 50 Whitney Straights had been completed.

==Design==
The &quot;Miles M.11 Whitney Straight&quot; was a twin-seat monoplane specifically built for use by flying clubs and private owners. Its construction was primarily composed of wood, including spruce frames and three-ply birch covering. The Whitney Straight featured a fixed main undercarriage complete with aerodynamic fairings, along with a fixed tailwheel. Relatively comfortable accommodation for its pilot, a single passenger and their luggage, was provided within an enclosed &#x27;side-by-side&#x27; cockpit. The cockpit was covered by a single-piece canopy comprising molded Perspex.

The wings of the Whitney Straight were relatively thick for the era; considerable effort had been put into their design to carefully define their drag properties. The wings were fitted with vacuum-operated split flaps; these were attributed as having enabled the type&#x27;s relatively low takeoff speed of 50 mph, as well as the aircraft&#x27;s high rate of climb. An alternative flap arrangement, that was noticeably more efficient and produced less drag while increasing lift coefficient, was experimented with during the later years of the prototype&#x27;s flying career; it directly influenced the design of several subsequent aircraft.

While early production aircraft were powered by a single de Havilland Gipsy Major I piston engine, alternative powerplants, such as the Villiers Maya and Menasco Pirate engines, were also used. While a fixed-pitch propeller was used on most aircraft, at least one aircraft was furnished with a variable-pitch propeller that, amongst other benefits, further shortened the takeoff distance required and boosted its initial rate of climb.

The Whitney Straight was routinely promoted as possessing a high level of safety, largely as a consequence of its favourable handling characteristics. F.G. Miles frequently performed relatively dramatic demonstrations to validate this claim, closing the throttle while in a steep climb and releasing the controls for the aircraft to return to level flight of its own accord after only a steep dive. Even when flown at relatively low altitudes, its recovery abilities were impressive.

==Operational history==
Numerous Whitney Straights participated in air racing events; in the 1937 King&#x27;s Cup Race alone, one of the type placed second, while another came in fourth. Several Whitney Straights were also modified as engine test beds, as well as to test different flap designs.

On 28 June 1938, the sole M.11C (&quot;G-AEYI&quot;) to be built crashed at Harefield, Berkshire, resulting in the death of its test pilot, Wing Commander F.W. Stent.

Efforts were made by Miles to promote the Whitney Straight to military customers, including its pre-war submission as an army cooperation aircraft for the British Army. Shortly following the outbreak of the Second World War, the Air Ministry impressed 23 Whitney Straights into military service, in which capacity they were operated as communications aircraft. Twenty-one such aircraft were based in Britain, while one was stationed in India, and another in Egypt. At least one M.11A also served with the Fleet Air Arm between 1940 and 1943, while three were reportedly used by the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

Between 1939 and 1943, a New Zealand-based aircraft, piloted by Alan Prichard, participated in aerial seed sowing trials at Ninety Mile Beach, and was subsequently used for spreading superphosphate. These trials were part of the experiments which led to the development of aerial topdressing and the proliferation of aircraft for agricultural purposes.

While not produced in large numbers, examples of the type have frequently had particularly lengthy operating lives. At least one aircraft remained in an airworthy condition.

<doc id="543057" wikidata="Q2160963" url="?curid=543057" title="PL/M">
<text>PL/M, an acronym for &quot;Programming Language for Microcomputers&quot;, is a high-level language conceived and developed by Gary Kildall in 1973 for Hank Smith at Intel for the Intel 8008. It was later expanded for the newer Intel 8080.

The 8080 had enough power to run the PL/M compiler, but lacked a suitable form of mass storage. In an effort to port the language from the PDP-10 to the 8080, Kildall used PL/M to write a disk operating system that allowed a floppy disk to be used. This was the basis of CP/M.

==History==
Kildall was working at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California in 1973 when he received funds to equip a computer lab, first with MCS-4-based SIM4 and, a year later, the Intel 8008-based Intel Intellec 8. As part of his employment, Kildall was allowed to spend one day a week on his own projects, but soon found himself spending much more than that living in his VW Microbus in the parking lot of the Intel offices on Bowers Avenue in Santa Clara.

One day he went to see Hank Smith, Intel&#x27;s manager for the tiny microcomputer software department. Kildall explained his idea of making a high level language for the 8008. Smith didn&#x27;t understand the concept, so Kildall explained that a programmer could write something like codice_1 and the program would convert that into several lines of assembler code which would perform this operation. Smith then called one of Intel&#x27;s customers and asked if they might be interested in such a product, and when they expressed their interest, Smith immediately told Kildall to do it.

Kildall wrote PL/M based on the concepts of the XPL language, which in turn was based on the syntax and concepts of IBM&#x27;s PL/I. XPL was explicitly designed to compile PL/I-like programs in a much simpler software system, explicitly for teaching purposes. As Kildall began promoting the language he found that few programmers were interested in it, until he demonstrated that one could write a program of roughly the same size and performance as assembly but in about a tenth of the time.

PL/M originally ran on large PDP-10 mainframe computers that would output the final machine language code on punch tape which would then be fed into an programmable ROM burner and then the ROMs would be transferred to the target machine. With the release of the Intellec 8 in 1974, he began an attempt to port the system to this platform to make it &quot;self hosting&quot; and allow programmers to do everything on that platform. Unfortunately, the 8008 had a very small eight entry call stack that was simply too small for a high-level language.

This problem was solved with the introduction of the first Intel 8080 in late 1973, which supported a stack of any size in memory. Intel upgraded the Intellec 8 to the Intellec 8/80 based on the new chip. Although this system had the processing power to run PL/M, it lacked any useful form of mass storage and adding a useful amount of main memory was extremely expensive. Just down the street from Intel, Memorex had recently introduced a new low-cost floppy disk drive, and this in turn prompted Alan Shugart to start Shugart Associates and introduce lower-cost drives. Kildall was able to talk Finis Conner, then at Shugart, into giving him one of their older test drives.

Unfortunately, there was no drive controller for the Intel systems, and while one was sketched out it was never implemented. After sitting on a shelf for a year, Kildall decided to go ahead and write the software needed to use it in PL/M running on his 8080-emulator on the PDP-10. In 1974 he called a friend from the University of Washington, John Torode, who built a controller for the 8080. After a few months the system was running, and Kildall loaded the driver and it ran the first time and displayed the prompt.

During the summer of 1975, Kildall was working as a consultant at Signetics, who asked him to port PL/M to their Signetics 2650. This resulted in the PLuS language. The 2650 &quot;bombed&quot; in the market and Signetics gave up on it within a year, deciding to license the Fairchild F8 instead. While working there he met Jim Warren, another consultant who was also setting up the new minicomputer-oriented magazine, &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Warren suggested Kildall put an ad in the magazine under the name of CP/M, and this launched the system into the market.

==Overview==
The language incorporated ideas from PL/I and XPL, and had an integrated macro processor. As a graduate of the University of Washington Kildall had used their Burroughs B5500 computer, and as such was aware of the potential of high-level languages such as ESPOL for systems programming.

Unlike other contemporary languages such as Pascal or BASIC, PL/M had no standard input or output routines. It included features targeted at the low-level hardware specific to the target microprocessors, and as such, it could support direct access to any location in memory, I/O ports and the processor interrupt flags in a very efficient manner. PL/M was the first higher level programming language for microprocessor-based computers and was the original implementation language for those parts of the CP/M operating system which were not written in assembler. Many Intel and Zilog Z80-based embedded systems were programmed in PL/M during the 1970s and 1980s. For instance, the firmware of the Service Processor component of CISC IBM AS/400 was written in PL/M.

The original PL/M compiler targeted the Intel 8008. An updated version (PL/M-80) generated code for the 8080 processor, which would also run on the newer Intel 8085 as well as on the Zilog Z80 family (as it is backward-compatible with the 8080). Later followed compilers for the Intel 8048 and Intel 8051-microcontroller family (PL/M-51) as well as for the 8086 (8088) (PL/M-86), 80186 (80188) and subsequent 8086-based processors, including the advanced 80286 and the 32-bit 80386. There were also PL/M compilers developed for later microcontrollers, such as the Intel 8061 and 8096 / MCS-96 architecture family (PL/M-96).

While some PL/M compilers were &quot;native&quot;, meaning that they ran on systems using that same microprocessor, e.g. for the Intel ISIS operating system, there were also cross compilers, for instance PLMX, which ran on other operating environments such as Digital Research CP/M, Microsoft&#x27;s DOS, and Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX/VMS.

PL/M is no longer supported by Intel, but aftermarket tools like PL/M-to-C source-code translators exist.

==PL/M sample code==

<text>John Hanson (died c. 1860) was an African American politician in Liberia. He served in Colonial Council and as a senator from Grand Bassa County following Liberia&#x27;s independence in 1847. He was born into slavery, but he purchased his freedom and emigrated from Baltimore to Liberia at age thirty-six. In Liberia, he joined the growing mercantile class. He also served as Commissary in the same county for several years, furnishing a house for the storage of arms and ammunition.
Hanson died in 1860, and was mourned as a &quot;faithful and patriotic servant&quot; by Liberian president Stephen Allen Benson.

Senator Hanson has sometimes been misidentified as being John Hanson of Maryland, a white politician who served as a President of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution.

<text>The New York City College of Technology (City Tech) is a public college in New York City. Founded in 1946, it is the City University of New York&#x27;s college of technology. Its main urban campus is located in Downtown Brooklyn.

==History==
City Tech was founded in 1946 as The New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences. The urgent mission at the time was to provide training to GIs returning from the Second World War and to provide New York with the technically proficient workforce it would need to thrive in the emerging post-war economy. From its beginnings as an Institute—to being chartered as a community college—and subsequently transitioning to senior college status during the 1980s—it has grown from serving 246 students in 1946, to a population today of more than 30,000 degree and non-degree seeking students.


==Academics==
City Tech has an enrollment of more than 14,000 students in 58 baccalaureate and associate degree programs including several engineering technology fields as well as architecture, construction, nursing, hospitality management, entertainment technology, dental hygiene, vision care technology, technology teacher training and paralegal training. Non-degree continuing education is also offered, and serves approximately 5,000 students each year. City Tech is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

The college&#x27;s academics are organized into three schools:
* School of Technology and Design
* School of Professional Studies
* School of Arts and Sciences

===Library===
The college hired its first library director in 1957. The current college library building went up around 1987. In 2012, the library staff adopted an open-access policy to make its members&#x27; professional research publicly accessible online.

==Campus==

City Tech occupies seven buildings within Downtown Brooklyn&#x27;s Tech Triangle, the MetroTech Business Improvement District, and DUMBO. College Administration and Offices, the Ursula C. Schwerin Library, the School of Professional Studies, and the School of Arts &amp; Sciences are primarily based in a complex formed by the Namm, Library (formerly Atrium), General, and Pearl buildings in MetroTech (300 Jay Street). The School of Technology &amp; Design is primarily based in Voorhees Hall in DUMBO.

A supertall skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano—which would have been known as City Tech Tower, with 65 floors for the college and 600 units of housing—was proposed, but scrapped.

In October 2013, City Tech held a ceremonial groundbreaking for a academic complex at the corner of Tillary and Jay Streets in Downtown Brooklyn, which opened in August 2018. The new complex occupies the site formerly occupied by the Klitgord Center. The new eight-story building, known as the Academic Complex, is home to City Tech&#x27;s expanding programs in healthcare and the sciences. The departments moved into the new building include the core sciences: Physics, Chemistry and Biological Sciences (including Biomedical Informatics). It is also home to the health programs: Nursing, Radiologic Technology &amp; Medical Imaging, Dental Hygiene, Restorative Dentistry, and Vision Care Technology. The Academic Complex includes a 1,000-seat concert hall quality auditorium, the largest of its kind in Downtown Brooklyn. A wellness center and faculty office space is also located in the Academic Complex.

==Athletics==
City Tech teams participated as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. City Tech began CUNYAC competition in the community college section from the conference&#x27;s inception in the 1987–88 season, later to join its senior college section in the 1999–2000 season. Men&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, soccer, tennis and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball. City Tech&#x27;s athletic program is in hiatus until new facilities are available.

<text>The Hän language (alternatively spelled as Haen) (also known as Dawson, Han-Kutchin, Moosehide) is a Northern Athabaskan language spoken by the Hän Hwëch&#x27;in (translated to &quot;people who live along the river&quot;, sometimes anglicized as &quot;Hankutchin&quot;). Athabascan refers to the interrelated complexity of languages spoken in Canada and Alaska each with its own dialect: the village of Eagle, Alaska in the United States and the town of Dawson City, Yukon Territory in Canada, though there are also Hän speakers in the nearby city of Fairbanks, Alaska. Furthermore, there was a decline in speakers in Dawson City as a result of the influx of gold miners in the mid-19th century.

Hän is in the Northern Athabaskan subgrouping of the Na-Dené language family. It is most closely related to Gwich&#x27;in and Upper Tanana.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The consonants of Hän are listed below with IPA notation on the left, the standard orthography in :

===Vowels===
== Revitalization ==
There are about a dozen people, all elderly, who speak Hän as their native language, though there is a growing second-language speaker community.

The Tr&#x27;ondëk Hwëch&#x27;in (formerly known as the Dawson First Nation) in the Yukon Territory support the revitalization of Hän, and there are current efforts to revive the language locally. There is an effort to promote traditional skills and finding a balance between the way of the newcomer&#x27;s which further promotes the development and revitalization of the language. As of April 2024, the last fluent speaker of Hän in Yukon, a 96-year-old elder, died.

Since 1991, the Robert Service School in Dawson City has hosted the Hän Language program, and the Tr&#x27;ondëk Hwëch&#x27;in supports adult language classes and bi-annual cultural gatherings.

There are many other resources used to learn Hän, particularly online ones such as, FirstVoices and Yukon Native Learning Centre. These online learning language tools teach the tradition, culture, history, and the language of Hän.

<doc id="543082" wikidata="Q78448" url="?curid=543082" title="Heinz Hopf">
<text>Heinz Hopf (19 November 1894 – 3 June 1971) was a German mathematician who worked on the fields of dynamical systems, topology and geometry.

==Early life and education==
Hopf was born in Gräbschen, German Empire (now , part of Wrocław, Poland), the son of Elizabeth (née Kirchner) and Wilhelm Hopf. His father was born Jewish and converted to Protestantism a year after Heinz was born; his mother was from a Protestant family.

Hopf attended Karl Mittelhaus higher boys&#x27; school from 1901 to 1904, and then entered the König-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Breslau. He showed mathematical talent from an early age. In 1913 he entered the Silesian Friedrich Wilhelm University where he attended lectures by Ernst Steinitz, Adolf Kneser, Max Dehn, Erhard Schmidt, and Rudolf Sturm. When World War I broke out in 1914, Hopf eagerly enlisted. He was wounded twice and received the iron cross (first class) in 1918.

After the war Hopf continued his mathematical education in Heidelberg (winter 1919/20 and summer 1920) and Berlin (starting in winter 1920/21). He studied under Ludwig Bieberbach and received his doctorate in 1925.

==Career==
In his dissertation, &quot;Connections between topology and metric of manifolds&quot; (German: &quot;Über Zusammenhänge zwischen Topologie und Metrik von Mannigfaltigkeiten&quot;), he proved that any simply connected complete Riemannian 3-manifold of constant sectional curvature is globally isometric to Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic space. He also studied the indices of zeros of vector fields on hypersurfaces, and connected their sum to curvature. Some six months later he gave a new proof that the sum of the indices of the zeros of a vector field on a manifold is independent of the choice of vector field and equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold. This theorem is now called the Poincaré–Hopf theorem.

Hopf spent the year after his doctorate at the University of Göttingen, where David Hilbert, Richard Courant, Carl Runge, and Emmy Noether were working. While there he met Pavel Alexandrov and began a lifelong friendship.

In 1926 Hopf moved back to Berlin, where he gave a course in combinatorial topology. He spent the academic year 1927/28 at Princeton University on a Rockefeller fellowship with Alexandrov. Solomon Lefschetz, Oswald Veblen and J. W. Alexander were all at Princeton at the time. At this time Hopf discovered the Hopf invariant of maps formula_1 and proved that the Hopf fibration has invariant 1. In the summer of 1928 Hopf returned to Berlin and began working with Pavel Alexandrov, at the suggestion of Courant, on a book on topology. Three volumes were planned, but only one was finished. It was published in 1935.

In 1929, he declined a job offer from Princeton University. In 1931 Hopf took Hermann Weyl&#x27;s position at ETH, in Zürich. Hopf received another invitation to Princeton in 1940, but he declined it. Two years later, however, he was forced to file for Swiss citizenship after his property was confiscated by Nazis, his father&#x27;s conversion to Christianity having failed to convince German authorities that he was an &quot;Aryan&quot;.

In 1946/47 and 1955/56 Hopf visited the United States, staying at Princeton and giving lectures at New York University and Stanford University. He served as president of the International Mathematical Union from 1955 to 1958.

==Personal life==
In October 1928 Hopf married Anja von Mickwitz (1891–1967).

==Honors and awards==
He received honorary doctorates from Princeton University, the University of Freiburg, the University of Manchester, the University of Paris, the Free University of Brussels, and the University of Lausanne. In 1949 he was elected a corresponding member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1957, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961, and the American Philosophical Society in 1963. He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Zürich in 1932 and a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1950.

In memory of Hopf, ETH Zürich awards the Heinz Hopf Prize for outstanding scientific work in the field of pure mathematics.

<text>James Aloysius Farley (May 30, 1888 – June 9, 1976) was an American politician who simultaneously served as chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and postmaster general under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose gubernatorial and presidential campaigns were run by Farley.

Born and raised in Rockland County, New York, Farley entered politics at a young age and quickly rose to run the Rockland County Democratic Party. After short stints campaigning for governor Al Smith and serving in the state legislature, he befriended Roosevelt and worked to build an effective Democratic machine across the entire state. Following Roosevelt&#x27;s victories in the gubernatorial elections of 1928 and 1930, he ran Roosevelt&#x27;s 1932 and 1936 presidential campaigns. His campaign style was meticulous and involved massive amounts of correspondence with individual party members to gather information and coordinate strategy. The 1936 campaign, where he correctly predicted the outcome in every state, earned him particular recognition.

Working as the chairman of the Democratic national committee and postmaster general, Farley worked to settle factional disputes within the party during Roosevelt&#x27;s first term, using his massive network of personal connections and patronage. Farley found himself in a transitional period in party politics, as Roosevelt and the New Deal coalition moved from a traditional party system built on local organizations and patronage to a national party system where parties campaigned on specific issues and relied on the support of auxiliary organizations. In Roosevelt&#x27;s second term, Farley found himself sidelined by Roosevelt, and broke with the president over his attempts to influence Congressional primary elections in favor of pro-New Deal candidates. Farley mounted a failed campaign for president to prevent Roosevelt from winning a third term in 1940.

Following his defeat, Farley was hired by the Coca-Cola Export Corporation, where he worked to promote international sales from 1940 to 1973. He also remained active in New York politics and served on the Hoover Commission from 1953 to 1956.

==Early life==
Farley was born on May 30, 1888, in Grassy Point, New York, to James Farley Sr. and Ellen Farley ( Goldrick). All four of his grandparents had immigrated to the United States from Ireland in the 1840s. James Farley Sr. was involved in the brick-making industry, first as a laborer and later as a part-owner of three schooners engaged in the brick-carrying trade.

James Farley Sr. died in an accident with a horse in January 1898. After the sudden death, Farley helped his mother tend a bar and grocery store that she purchased to support the family. After graduating from high school, he attended Packard Business College in New York City to study bookkeeping and other business skills. After his graduation, he was employed by the United States Gypsum Corporation.

==Early political career==
Farley made his entry into politics in 1908, working for Alex Sutherland during his unsuccessful campaign to become town clerk of Stony Point. In 1910, Farley ran for the office of town clerk himself and won. Despite Stony Point&#x27;s Republican leanings, Farley was reelected twice. He was elected chairman of the Rockland County Democratic Party in 1918. That same year, he campaigned for Al Smith to become Governor of New York and befriended many politicians in Tammany Hall, although he would repeatedly fail to enter Smith&#x27;s inner circle of advisors. Smith appointed Farley to be a Port Warden of New York City between 1918 and 1919. Farley married the former Elizabeth A. Finnegan (&quot;Bess&quot;) in April 1920. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Ann, and one son, James A. Farley Jr. 

Farley ran for the New York State Assembly in 1922 and won in Rockland County, normally a solid Republican stronghold. He sat in the 146th New York State Legislature in 1923, where he introduced 33 bills, 19 of which passed. He lost his seat at the next election. Farley blamed the loss on his vote for the repeal of the Mullan–Gage Act, the state law to enforce Prohibition, while other biographers attributed the loss to his associations with Tammany Hall.

Farley was appointed to the New York State Athletic Commission by Governor Smith with the support of Tammany boss Charles F. Murphy and Jimmy Walker. He soon became chairman of the commission and held the title until he joined the Roosevelt administration in 1933. In 1926, Farley threatened to resign his post as Athletic Commissioner if boxing champion Jack Dempsey did not fight the mandatory challenger, African-American fighter Harry Wills. Farley banned Dempsey from fighting Gene Tunney and publicly threatened to revoke Tex Rickard&#x27;s Madison Square Garden license if he ignored the ruling of the commission. The intervention was popular with African Americans who viewed Dempsey&#x27;s decision as a form of discrimination. Farley was also accused of purchasing thousands of tickets to boxing matches to give away as favors. During his time on the commission, Farley continued work his business interests. His company merged with five other building contractors to form the General Builders Supply Corporation, which Farley served as president of from 1929 to 1933.

==Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign manager==
Farley served as a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention, where he befriended Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would give his famous &quot;Happy Warrior&quot; speech for Smith. In 1928, Smith became the Democratic nominee in the presidential election, and Roosevelt ran for governor to replace Smith. Farley was chosen as the secretary for the New York State Democratic Committee that summer, and launched a letter-writing campaign to the state&#x27;s county organizations to support Roosevelt. Although Smith failed to win New York in the presidential election, Roosevelt was successfully elected governor, due to stronger support in upstate New York. 

In 1929, Farley toured the state to gather information on the state of each county party organization, which he compiled in a report to Roosevelt. He recommended that the Democrats involve more women in party affairs to better appeal to women voters and distribute patronage more fairly to the various counties, a principle he labeled &quot;proper consideration&quot;. He also encouraged county organizations to replace ineffective chairmen and establish full committees covering every precinct in their counties. Farley replaced William Bray as chairman of the New York Democratic Party in 1930. That year, Roosevelt was reelected with a massive majority, sweeping 42 of the 57 counties in upstate New York. The day after the election, Farley announced: &quot;We have elected as Governor the man who will be the next President of the United States.&quot;

After the success in 1930, Roosevelt turned his attention to running in the 1932 presidential election. Knowing that Al Smith would compete with him for the northeastern delegates at the Democratic convention, Roosevelt sought the support from other regions. Farley toured the western United States in 1931 to determine the willingness of western Democrats to support Roosevelt, claiming that he was merely traveling to an Elks convention in Seattle, a disguise which fooled few. Although his efforts to build support for Roosevelt among urban machines in the northeast and midwest failed, Farley became familiar with members of the Texas delegation. He used his connections to secure Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination on the fourth ballot at the 1932 Democratic National Convention by offering to make Texan leader John Nance Garner the running mate. For his previous work, Farley was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee and chosen by Roosevelt to be his campaign manager. 

During the 1932 presidential election, Farley befriended Indiana journalist Claude G. Bowers, whom Roosevelt had also recruited to work for the campaign. After Roosevelt&#x27;s victory, Bowers was appointed as the United States Ambassador to Spain with Farley&#x27;s recommendation. The two would continue a correspondence during Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency to keep each other informed on domestic and foreign developments, and Bowers would write many speeches for Farley.

Farley&#x27;s role as Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign manager continued in the 1936 presidential election. Ahead of the 1936 Democratic National Convention, Farley lobbied the rest of the party to repeal the convention rule requiring a two-thirds majority for presidential nominees. He continued his systematic approach to campaigning and maintained a massive correspondence list with party officials across the country, monitoring the situation on the ground and providing advice based on his experience in New York. The election marked the high point of Farley&#x27;s political career when he correctly predicted that Roosevelt would win all but two states, Maine and Vermont.

==Postmaster general==
Following Roosevelt&#x27;s election as president, Farley was appointed postmaster general, a cabinet position which oversaw patronage for over 100,000 civil service-exempt jobs. Farley used his position effectively to mediate disputes between different factions during Roosevelt&#x27;s first term and avoided any major scandals around appointments. However, Farley was frustrated by competition from cabinet secretaries for control of appointments to various New Deal programs, and disagreed with Roosevelt and other cabinet secretaries on who to reward with patronage, believing that partisan loyalty mattered more than ideological alignment with the New Deal. At Roosevelt&#x27;s direction, Farley did not lend any support to the Tammany machine, now opposed to Roosevelt, in New York City&#x27;s mayoral election in 1933, enabling Fiorello La Guardia, a Republican who supported the New Deal, to be elected mayor, and did not intervene against the Wisconsin Progressive Party or Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party, both of which supported the New Deal, in the 1934 midterm elections. Some patronage was diverted to progressive Republican Hiram Johnson and to Wisconsin Progressive Robert M. La Follette Jr. over objections from Democrats.

Farley&#x27;s role is remembered among stamp collectors for two things. One is a series of souvenir sheets that were issued at commemorative events and bore his name as the authorizer. The other is the 20 stamps, known as &quot;Farley&#x27;s Follies&quot;, which were reprints, mostly imperforate and ungummed, of stamps of the period: Farley bought them at face value, out of his own pocket, and gave them to Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, both collectors, and to members of his family and special friends of the Administration. (Farley himself did not collect stamps.) Unfortunately, some of them reached the market, offered at the high prices commanded by rarities. When ordinary stamp collectors learned of that, they lodged strenuous protests, newspaper editorials leveled charges of corruption, and a heated Congressional investigation ensued. Finally, in 1935 many more of the unfinished stamps were produced and made generally available to collectors at their face value. 

During Roosevelt&#x27;s second term, Farley&#x27;s close relationship with the president deteriorated. Roosevelt began making decisions without consulting Farley, instead relying on advisors Harry Hopkins and Thomas Corcoran to fill his role, and damaged Farley&#x27;s relationships with members of Congress by introducing his court-packing plan and intervening in the Senate leadership election following Joseph T. Robinson&#x27;s death. In 1938, Roosevelt intervened in congressional primaries by endorsing progressive candidates over conservatives, infuriating Farley. A split between the two was rumored in the press that summer.

In 1940 Farley authorized the first postage stamp featuring the likeness of an African American, Booker T. Washington. This effort was spearheaded by Eleanor Roosevelt as well as others. The first Booker T. Washington stamp was sold by Farley to George Washington Carver at the Tuskegee Institute on April 7, 1940. Farley also appeared as a featured speaker at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago in 1940 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865.

==Presidential candidate==
As the 1940 presidential election approached, Farley joined forces with other Democrats who wished to prevent Roosevelt from seeking a third term. In January 1939, he compiled a report assessing his own prospects on winning the Democratic nomination and other potential anti-Roosevelt Democrats, and he began to travel extensively to determine the level of support for Roosevelt. Roosevelt initially declined to make a formal announcement that he was running for a third term, delaying Farley from doing the same, and arranged a meeting between Farley and Cardinal George Mundelein in July 1939 in which Mundelein advised Farley against running for president. Farley traveled to Europe in the summer of 1939 in the hopes of raising his profile as a statesman. He visited several countries and enjoyed an audience with Pope Pius XII, but the outbreak of war in Europe upon his return discouraged him from publicly announcing his presidential candidacy. 

Farley was at a disadvantage due to his lack of experience in elected office, knowledge of foreign policy, or a defined platform. He remained optimistic of his chances as he traveled, believing that he could overcome these issues using the same methods he always had. Farley took great interest in his ability to meet new voters, to the point that during a tour of the southern states in April 1940, he had someone count how many people he exchanged a handshake with. He managed to shake hands with at least 9,847 voters, and estimated he met another 1,500 which were not counted.

At the 1940 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Farley was nominated for president by his ally Carter Glass. He finished a distant second on the first ballot, with delegates to Roosevelt&#x27;s . Following the defeat, Farley resigned from his positions as national chairman and postmaster general. He confided to Bowers, &quot;I did what I thought was best and I have no apologies and no regrets. My conscience is clear.&quot;

==Later life==

After leaving office in 1940, Farley was named chairman of the board of the Coca-Cola Export Corporation. Farley held this post until his retirement in 1973. Roosevelt considered appointing Farley as director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission during World War II, but decided against it. In 1943, knowing he would not be allowed to participate in the war effort, Farley moved with Bess to New York City, where he would live in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the remainder of his life. Between 1953 and 1956, he would serve on the Hoover Commission with his Waldorf neighbor, former president Herbert Hoover, although his work for Coca-Cola occupied most of his time.

Farley remained the chairman of the New York Democratic Party after his resignations. In 1941, he was encouraged by allies to run for Mayor of New York City. He declined, but supported William O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s failed campaign against La Guardia, delivering several speeches accusing La Guardia of being a communist. Farley faced a final political battle with Roosevelt in 1942, when the president intervened to promote a pro-New Deal candidate, James M. Mead, over Attorney General John J. Bennett Jr. Bennett was victorious at the state convention with Farley&#x27;s help, but this was a Pyrrhic victory, as Bennett&#x27;s poor relationship with organized labor caused him to lose to Republican Thomas E. Dewey. Farley would resign as chairman on June 8, 1944. After a failed attempt to thwart Roosevelt from seeking a fourth term, Farley largely retired from politics. He would make one final attempt to seek office in 1958 with an abortive campaign to run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Irving Ives. In 1965, Farley served as the campaign chairman for the failed first Mayoral bid of Abraham Beame, who would go on to be the first practicing Jewish Mayor of New York in 1973.

On November 6, 1947, Farley was the first ever guest to appear on NBC&#x27;s Meet the Press program. On October 26, 1963, Tuskegee University conferred upon Farley the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws for his &quot;many contributions to public life&quot; and for his &quot;distinguished possession of the private personal virtues&quot;. He was given the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame in 1974.

On June 9, 1976, Farley died in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria. The last surviving member of Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet, he was interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.

==Legacy==

Farley was commonly referred to as a political kingmaker for his work on Roosevelt&#x27;s rise to the presidency. He was renowned as a political prophet for his correct predictions of the outcomes of the 1932 and 1936 presidential elections. Maine&#x27;s status as a bellwether in national elections had been established since 1888 by the saying &quot;As Maine goes, so goes the nation&quot;. Speaking to reporters after the 1936 election, Farley gave the famous remark, &quot;As Maine goes, so goes Vermont&quot;.

Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called Farley the last member of the &quot;classical school&quot; of machine politicians in the Democratic Party, who built political parties around local organizations to win votes. Farley failed to adapt to the New Deal and the introduction of political campaigns based on ideologies and issues, preferring to work as a broker of patronage and services for party members. During Farley&#x27;s time as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, his organizing efforts were frustrated by the emergence of parallel organizations to the party, most notably the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which raised its own funds to support candidates instead of donating directly to the party, and he failed to understand the concepts behind the New Deal Coalition that made the 1936 campaign succeed.

The landmark James A. Farley Building in New York City was named for Farley as a monument to his career in public service.

<text>The names for chemical elements in East Asian languages, along with those for some chemical compounds (mostly organic), are among the newest words to enter the local vocabularies. Except for those metals well-known since antiquity, the names of most elements were created after modern chemistry was introduced to East Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, with more translations being coined for those elements discovered later.

While most East Asian languages use—or have used—the Chinese script, only the Chinese language uses logograms as the predominant way of naming elements. Native phonetic writing systems are primarily used for element names in Japanese (Katakana), Korean (Hangul) and Vietnamese (chữ Quốc ngữ).

== Chinese ==
In Chinese, characters for the elements are the last officially created and recognized characters in the Chinese writing system. Unlike characters for unofficial varieties of Chinese (e.g., written Cantonese) or other now-defunct &quot;ad hoc&quot; characters (e.g., those by the Empress Wu), the names for the elements are official, consistent, and taught (with Mandarin pronunciation) to every Chinese and Taiwanese student who has attended public schools (usually by the first year of middle school). New names and symbols are decided upon by the China National Committee for Terminology in Science and Technology.

=== Native characters ===
Some metallic elements were already familiar to the Chinese, as their ores were already excavated and used extensively in China for construction, alchemy, and medicine. These include the long-established group of &quot;Five Metals&quot; (五金) — gold (金), silver (銀/银), copper (銅/铜), iron (鐵/铁), and tin (錫/锡) — as well as lead (鉛/铅) and mercury (汞).

Some non-metals were already named in Chinese as well, because their minerals were in widespread use. For example,
* boron (硼) as part of borax
* carbon (碳) in the form of charcoal
* sulfur (硫) had been used to make gunpowder since at least the 10th century in China.

=== Characters based on European pronunciations ===
However, the Chinese did not know about most of the elements until they were isolated during the Industrial Age. These new elements therefore required new characters, which were invented using the phono-semantic principle. Each character consists of two parts, one to signify the meaning and the other to hint at the sound:

The semantic (meaning) part is also the radical of the character. It refers to the element&#x27;s usual state at room temperature and standard pressure. Only four radicals are used for elements: / (&quot;jīn&quot; &quot;gold; metal&quot;) for solid metals, (&quot;shí&quot; &quot;stone, rock&quot;) for solid non-metals, / (&quot;shuǐ&quot; &quot;water&quot;) for liquids, and (&quot;qì&quot; &quot;air, steam&quot;) for gases.

The phonetic (sound) part represents the character&#x27;s pronunciation and is a partial transliteration of the element&#x27;s name. For each element character, this is a unique phonetic component. Since 118 elements have been discovered, over 100 phonetic components are used in naming the elements. Because many characters in modern Chinese are homophones, including for tone, two different phonetic components can be pronounced the same. Current practice dictates that new names should avoid being homophonous with previous element names or with organic functional groups. However, this rule was not rigorously followed in the past, and confusingly, the names of tin (锡) and selenium (硒) both have the pronunciation &quot;xī&quot; with the same tone. The alternative pronunciation &quot;xí&quot; for tin is recommended by the National Committee for Approval of Terms in Science and Technology (全国科学技术名词审定委员会).

锡 (tin) and 硒 (selenium) are not homophones in Nanjing Mandarin, which was the prestige dialect of Chinese when most elements were named, which was until the late 19th century. The phonetic component of 锡, 易 (&quot;yì&quot;), was accurate when the character was invented around 3000 years ago, but not now because of sound change. In Middle Chinese 锡 was an entering tone character, a closed syllable ending in -p/-t/-k (or -ʔ in some modern dialects). But 硒 was constructed in the late 19th century using the (still accurate) phonetic 西 (&quot;xī&quot;), which in Middle Chinese was a level tone character, an open syllable with a vowel ending. In Beijing Mandarin, the variety on which Standard Modern Chinese is based, stop consonant endings of syllables were dropped, and the entering tone was merged into the other tones in a complex and irregular manner by the 16th–17th centuries, and 锡 and 西 both became Tone 1 (high tone) characters. In dialects that preserve the entering tone, like Nanjing Mandarin and Shanghainese and Cantonese, 锡 retains a -k or -ʔ ending and 锡 and 西 (硒) are pronounced differently.

This sometimes causes difficulty in verbal communication, as Sn and Se can both be divalent and tetravalent. Thus, SnO2 二氧化锡 and SeO2 二氧化硒 would be pronounced identically, as &quot;èryǎnghuàxī&quot;, if not for the variant &quot;xí&quot; for 锡. To avoid further confusion, P.R.C. authorities avoided using the name 矽 &quot;xī&quot; (or any tonal variants) for silicon. (In Taiwan 矽 is pronounced &quot;xì&quot;.)

:† / is primarily pronounced as &quot;nèi&quot;, but less commonly as &quot;nà&quot;, the source of /. Likewise, the primary pronunciation of is &quot;dì&quot;, but the alternate reading of &quot;tì&quot; gave rise to /.
:* The derived pronunciation differs (in tone or in sound) from the pronunciation of the element.

The &quot;water&quot; radical () is not used much here, as only two elements (bromine and mercury) are truly liquid at standard room temperature and pressure. Their characters are not based on the European pronunciation of the elements&#x27; names. Bromine (), the only liquid nonmetal at room temperature, is explained in the following section. Mercury (), now grouped with the heavy metals, was long classified as a kind of fluid in ancient China.

=== Meaning-based characters ===
A few characters, though, are not created using the above &quot;phono-semantic&quot; design, but are &quot;semantic-semantic&quot;, that is, both of its parts indicate meanings. One part refers to the element&#x27;s usual state (like the semanto-phonetic characters), while the other part indicates some additional property or function of the element. In addition, the second part also indicates the pronunciation of the element. Such elements are:

=== Usage in the nomenclature for simple inorganic compounds ===
Simple covalent binary inorganic compounds E&quot;m&quot;X&quot;n&quot; are named as

: &quot;n&quot; X 化 (&quot;huà&quot;) &quot;m&quot; E   (with &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; written as Chinese numerals),

where X is more electronegative than E, using the IUPAC formal electronegativity order. 化 as a full noun or verb means &#x27;change; transform(ation)&#x27;. As a noun suffix, it is equivalent to the English suffixes -ized/-ated/-ified. It is the root of the word 化学 (huàxué) &#x27;chemistry&#x27;.

For example, P4S10 is called 十硫化四磷 (shíliúhuàsìlín) (literally: &#x27;ten sulfur of four phosphorus&#x27;, &#x27;decasulfide of tetraphosphorus&#x27;). As in English nomenclature, if &quot;m&quot; = 1, the numerical prefix of E is usually dropped in covalent compounds. For example, CO is called 一氧化碳 (yīyǎnghuàtàn) (literally: &#x27;one oxygen of carbon&#x27;, &#x27;monoxide of carbon&#x27;).

However, for compounds named as salts, numerical prefixes are dropped altogether, as in English. Thus, calcium chloride, CaCl2, is named 氯化钙 (literally: &#x27;chloride of calcium&#x27;). The Chinese name for FeCl3, 氯化铁, literally means &#x27;chlorinated iron&#x27; and is akin to the archaic English names &#x27;muriated iron&#x27; or &#x27;muriate of iron&#x27;. In this example, 氯 is &#x27;chlorine&#x27; and 铁 is &#x27;iron&#x27;.

There is a Chinese analog of the &quot;-ic&quot;/-&quot;ous&quot; nomenclature for higher/lower oxidation states: &quot;-ous&quot; is translated as 亚 (&quot;yà&quot;, &#x27;minor; secondary&#x27;): for example, FeCl2 is 氯化亚铁 and FeCl3 is 氯化铁. In a four-way contrast, &quot;hypo-&quot; is translated as 次 (&quot;cì&quot;, &#x27;inferior; following&#x27;) and &quot;per-&quot; is translated as 高 (&quot;gāo&quot;, &#x27;high, upper&#x27;). For example, the acid HClO is 次氯酸 &quot;inferior chlorine acid&quot;, HClO&quot;2&quot; is 亚氯酸, HClO&quot;3&quot; is 氯酸, and HClO&quot;4&quot; is 高氯酸. In this example, the character 酸 (suān, &#x27;sour&#x27;) means (organic or inorganic) acid. The more modern Stock nomenclature in which oxidation state is explicitly specified can also be used: thus, tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) is simply 氧化锡(IV).

=== Recently discovered elements ===

In 2015, IUPAC recognised the discovery of four new elements. In November 2016, IUPAC published their formal names and symbols: nihonium (113Nh), moscovium (115Mc), tennessine (117Ts), and oganesson (118Og).

Subsequently, in January 2017, the China National Committee for Terms in Sciences and Technologies published four naming characters for these elements. The National Academy for Educational Research under the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China on Taiwan published an almost identical list (the only differences being the use of the traditional Chinese metal radical &#x27;釒&#x27; in place of the simplified Chinese form &#x27;钅&#x27; for nihonium and moscovium) in April 2017.

For traditional Chinese, nihonium and moscovium were then existing characters; while in simplified Chinese, only moscovium already existed in the Unicode Standard. The missing characters were added to Unicode version 11.0 as urgently-needed characters in June 2018.

The Chinese characters for these symbols are:
: Nihonium: Traditional: Simplified: (&quot;nǐ&quot;)
: Moscovium: Traditional: Simplified: (&quot;mò&quot;)
: Tennessine: Both Traditional and Simplified: (&quot;tián&quot;)
: Oganesson: Both Traditional and Simplified: (&quot;ào&quot;)

=== In the periodic table ===
Pronunciations for some elements differ between mainland China and Taiwan, as described in the article. Simplified characters and mainland Chinese pronunciations are shown above. Some of the characters for the superheavy elements may not be visible depending on fonts.

=== Notes ===

A minority of the &quot;new characters&quot; are not completely new inventions, as they coincide with archaic characters, whose original meanings have long been lost to most people. For example, (beryllium), (chromium), (lanthanum), and (protactinium), are obscure characters meaning &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;hook&quot;, &quot;harrow&quot;, and &quot;raw iron&quot;, respectively.

Some elements&#x27; names were already present as characters used in the names of members of the House of Zhu. In the early Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor established a rule that his descendants&#x27; given names must follow the order of the Five Phases per generation, and should have a character including the radical for one of the Five Phases. Some later descendants had to adopt rarely used characters, and even created new characters to fit this rule, which were later readopted for chemical elements. For example,
* radium (鐳/镭) from (朱慎鐳, 1572–1598), Prince Yonghe Gongyi
* polonium (釙/钋) from (朱徵釙, 1440–1469), Prince Hanhui
* cerium (鈰/铈) from (朱恩鈰, 1460–1497), Prince Yuanling Xuanmu.

Most element names are the same in Simplified and Traditional Chinese, merely being variants of each other, since most of the names were translated by a single body of standardization before the PRC-ROC split. However, elements discovered close to, during, or after the split sometimes have different names in Taiwan and in mainland China. In Hong Kong, both Taiwanese and mainland Chinese names are used. A few pronunciations also differ even when the characters are analogous: cobalt gǔ (PRC) / gū (ROC); palladium bǎ (PRC) / bā (ROC); tin xī (PRC) / xí (ROC); antimony tī (PRC) / tì (ROC); polonium pō (PRC) / pò (ROC); uranium yóu (PRC) / yòu (ROC); bohrium bō (PRC) / pō (ROC).

The isotopes of hydrogen – protium (1H), deuterium (D) and tritium (T) – are written 氕 &quot;piē&quot;, 氘 &quot;dāo&quot; and 氚 &quot;chuān&quot;, respectively, in both simplified and traditional writing.
鑀 is used in Taiwan for both einsteinium (mainland China: 锿) and ionium, a previous name for the isotope thorium-230.

===History===
In 1871, John Fryer and Shou Xu proposed the modern convention of exclusively using single characters for element names.

== Japanese ==
Like other words in the language, elements&#x27; names in Japanese can be native (&quot;yamatokotoba&quot;), from China (Sino-Japanese) or from Europe (&quot;gairaigo&quot;).

=== Names based on European pronunciations ===
Even though the Japanese language also uses Chinese characters (&quot;kanji&quot;), it primarily employs &quot;katakana&quot; to transliterate names of the elements from European languages (often German/Dutch or Latin [via German] or English). Elements not listed in any of the tables below have their names follow English, like tungsten.
=== Native names ===
On the other hand, elements known since antiquity are Chinese loanwords, which are mostly identical to their Chinese counterparts, albeit in the &quot;Shinjitai&quot;, for example, iron () is &quot;tetsu&quot; (Tang-dynasty loan) and lead () is &quot;namari&quot; (native reading). While all elements in Chinese are single-character in the official system, some Japanese elements have two characters. Often this parallels colloquial or everyday names for such elements in Chinese, such as 水銀/水银 () for mercury and 硫黃/硫黄 () for sulfur. A special case is tin (, &quot;suzu&quot;), which is more often written in &quot;katakana&quot; ().

=== Meaning-based names ===
Some names were later invented to describe properties or characteristics of the element. 
They were mostly introduced around the 18th century to Japan, and they sometimes differ drastically from their Chinese counterparts. The following comparison shows that Japanese does not use the radical system for naming elements like Chinese.

== Korean ==
As &quot;Hanja&quot; (Sino-Korean characters) are now rarely used in Korea, all of the elements are written in &quot;Hangul&quot;.
Since many Korean scientific terms were translated from Japanese sources, the pattern of naming is mostly similar to that of Japanese. Namely, the classical elements are loanwords from China, with new elements from European languages. But recently, some elements&#x27; names were changed. For example:
Pre-modern (18th-century) elements often are the Korean pronunciation of their Japanese equivalents, e.g.,
== Vietnamese ==
In Vietnamese, some of the elements known since antiquity and medieval times are loanwords from Chinese, such as copper (&quot;đồng&quot; from ), tin (&quot;thiếc&quot; from ), mercury (&quot;thuỷ ngân&quot; from ), sulfur (&quot;lưu huỳnh&quot; from ), oxygen (&quot;dưỡng khí&quot; from ; &quot;oxi&quot; or &quot;oxy&quot; is the more common name) and platinum (&quot;bạch kim&quot; from ; &quot;platin&quot; is another common name). 
Others have native or old Sino-Vietnamese names, such as &quot;sắt&quot; for iron, &quot;bạc&quot; for silver, &quot;chì&quot; for lead, &quot;vàng&quot; for gold, &quot;kền&quot; for nickel (&quot;niken&quot; or &quot;nickel&quot; are the more common names) and &quot;kẽm&quot; for zinc. 
In either case, now they are written in the Vietnamese alphabet. Before the Latin alphabet was introduced, &quot;sắt&quot; was rendered as , &quot;bạc&quot; as , &quot;chì&quot; as , &quot;vàng&quot; as , &quot;kền&quot; as and &quot;kẽm&quot; as in &quot;Chữ Nôm&quot;.

The majority of elements are shortened and localized pronunciations of the European names (usually from French). For example:
* &quot;Phosphorus&quot; becomes &quot;phốtpho&quot; and &quot;phosphor&quot;.
* The -&quot;ine&quot; suffix is absent, e.g., &quot;chlorine&quot;, &quot;iodine&quot; and &quot;fluorine&quot; become &quot;clo&quot;, &quot;iốt&quot; (or &quot;iod&quot;) and &quot;flo&quot;, respectively; compare French &quot;chlore&quot;, &quot;iode&quot;, &quot;fluor&quot;.
* The -&quot;um&quot; suffix is lost, e.g., &quot;caesium&quot; becomes &quot;xêzi&quot; (or &quot;caesi&quot;), pronounced ; compare the French &quot;césium&quot;, pronounced (whereas the English is ).
** Similarly, &quot;beryllium&quot;, &quot;tellurium&quot;, &quot;lithium&quot;, &quot;natrium&quot; (sodium), and &quot;lanthanum&quot; become &quot;berili&quot;, &quot;telua&quot;, &quot;liti&quot;, &quot;natri&quot;, and &quot;lantan&quot; respectively
* The -&quot;gen&quot; suffix is lost, e.g., &quot;nitrogen&quot;, &quot;oxygen&quot; and &quot;hydrogen&quot; become &quot;nitơ&quot;, &quot;ôxy&quot; and &quot;hiđrô&quot;, respectively

A minority of elements, mostly those not suffixed with -&quot;ium&quot;, retain their full name, e.g.,
* Tungsten (aka wolfram) becomes &quot;volfram&quot;.
* Bismuth becomes &quot;bitmut&quot;.
* Aluminium becomes &quot;nhôm&quot; (), because the ending has a similar pronunciation. It was the first element to be known in English in Vietnam.
* Elements with the -&quot;on&quot; suffix (e.g. noble gases) seem to be inconsistent. &quot;Boron&quot; and &quot;silicon&quot; are respectively shortened to &quot;bo&quot; and &quot;silic&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;neon&quot;, &quot;argon&quot;, &quot;krypton&quot;, &quot;xenon&quot; and &quot;radon&quot; do not have common shorter forms.
* Unlike the other halogens, &quot;astatine&quot; retains its suffix (&quot;astatin&quot; in Vietnamese).
* Antimony is shortened to &quot;antimon&quot;, and arsenic to &quot;asen&quot;; these names are similar to the German ones (&quot;Antimon&quot; and &quot;Arsen&quot;, respectively).

Some elements have multiple names, for instance, potassium is known as &quot;pô-tát&quot; and &quot;kali&quot; (from &quot;kalium&quot;, the element&#x27;s Latin name).

Update in 2018 General Education Program, chemistry section: (At page 50) 
* Integration principles: Chemical nomenclature is used according to recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) with reference to Vietnamese Standards (TCVN 5529:2010 and 5530:2010 of the Directorate for Standards, Metrology and Quality, Decision No. 2950-QD/BKHCN of the Ministry of Science and Technology), consistent with Vietnamese practice, gradually meeting the requirements of unification and integration. 
* Practical principles: Use the names of 13 elements commonly used in Vietnamese: gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, aluminum, zinc, sulfur, tin, nitrogen, sodium, potassium and mercury; At the same time, there are English terms for easy reference. Compounds of these elements are named according to IUPAC recommendations

<doc id="543093" wikidata="Q7867039" url="?curid=543093" title="USS Adirondack (AGC-15)">
<text>The third USS &quot;Adirondack&quot; (AGC-15) was laid down on 18 November 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract by the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company in Wilmington, North Carolina; launched on 13 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. E. L. White; transferred to the Navy on 4 February 1945; towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for conversion; and commissioned on 2 September 1945, the day Japan surrendered on board the battleship in Tokyo Bay.

==Service history==

===1945–1950===
The ship was designed as an amphibious force flagship, a floating command post with advanced communications equipment and extensive combat information spaces to be used by the amphibious forces commander and landing force commander during large-scale operations. After shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay from 25 September to 12 October 1945, &quot;Adirondack&quot; assumed the duties of flagship for Commander, Operational Development Force (CTF 69), and operated out of Norfolk until August 1949, when she was scheduled to participate in an Antarctic expedition. However, that project was cancelled, and &quot;Adirondack&quot; reported to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for inactivation. On 1 February 1950, she was placed in reserve, in service, as flagship of the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===1951–1953===
Over a year later, the command ship returned to the active fleet. Following a recommissioning ceremony in Philadelphia on 4 April 1951, &quot;Adirondack&quot; reported to the Atlantic Fleet Training Command in Norfolk, Virginia, for inspection and training. She returned to Philadelphia on 3 June to complete final preparations for a tour in the Mediterranean as flagship for the Commander in Chief, Allied Forces in southern Europe (CINCSOUTH), and for the Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets (CINCNELM).

&quot;Adirondack&quot; steamed to the Mediterranean, and on 18 August, moored in Naples, which was to be her home port for almost two years. In addition to her duties as Flagship for CINCSOUTH and CINCNELM, she coordinated activities of units of the 6th Fleet as they arrived and departed and assumed the administrative duties of senior officer present afloat. After 14 June 1952, &quot;Adirondack&quot; also served as the flagship for Commander, Subordinate Command, Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets, and then for Commander, Fleet Air, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. On 29 May 1953, she departed Naples and returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for and reassignment.

===1954===
Following a shakedown and training cruise to Guantanamo Bay, &quot;Adirondack&quot; headed back to Norfolk, Virginia, and on 28 October, became flagship for Commander, Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. She sailed from Norfolk on 12 February 1954 to conduct a tour of inspection of amphibious bases in the Caribbean area. In a transfer of flags at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 23 March, Commander Amphibious Group Four (COMPHIBGRU FOUR) shifted his flag to &quot;Adirondack&quot;. One week later, the amphibious command ship participated in Operation &quot;Sentry Box&quot; held off Vieques, Puerto Rico. The exercise was the first joint Army-Navy exercise in the Atlantic since the fall of 1952 and employed more than 3,000 native Puerto Rican troops of the Army. This rigorous operation touched off a year of Atlantic Fleet exercises in which &quot;Adirondack&quot; played a major role.

In April COMPHIBGRU FOUR—still embarked in &quot;Adirondack&quot; – was designated Commander of the umpire group for LANTAGLEX-54, a full-scale amphibious assault on Onslow Beach, North Carolina. The umpire group exercised the participating units, evaluated training, and assessed &quot;damage&quot; inflicted by the &quot;hostile&quot; units. Another exercise, &quot;Packard V,&quot; was held in May and consisted of a naval gunfire demonstration in the Chesapeake Bay and a full-scale D-day assault on Onslow Beach, directed from &quot;Adirondack&quot; by COMPHIBGRU FOUR.

On 20 July, the ship departed Norfolk for Operation Keystone, a combined land, sea, and air maneuver in the Mediterranean involving forces of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Planning conferences were held in Naples, Italy, and the amphibious task force sortied on 30 August with observers from the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey embarked in &quot;Adirondack&quot;. On 4 September, the task force landed more than 1,500 Marines on the beaches at Dikili, Turkey. The flagship arrived back in Norfolk on 27 September and immediately began preparations for the next series of drills.

On 22 October, she departed Norfolk to rendezvous with other ships participating in Operation &quot;NORAMEX&quot; off the coast of Labrador. A battalion of marines landed on the beaches of Hamilton Inlet on 1 November to test amphibious cold weather doctrine and equipment. After a successful drill, &quot;Adirondack&quot; sailed on 3 November for Bogue Inlet, North Carolina, for a full-scale assault climaxing the amphibious phases of the Atlantic Fleet training cycle for 1954. She returned to Norfolk on 20 November and leave and upkeep.

===1955===
During 1955, &quot;Adirondack&quot; served as umpire for &quot;ANGEX II,&quot; a naval gunfire exercise held in February off Vieques and Culebra, Puerto Rico. In early March she observed the &quot;TRAEX 11-55&quot; landing off Vieques as part of the umpire group for the atomic defense exercise phase. She remained in port in Norfolk from 9 March to 11 April and headed south for &quot;TRAEX 111-55&quot; off Vieques. She returned to Norfolk for inactivation; was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 9 November 1955; and transferred to the Maritime Administration for berthing with the James River unit of the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Adirondack&quot; was stricken from the Navy list on 1 June 1961 and sold on 7 November 1972 to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation of New York City for scrap.

<doc id="543095" wikidata="Q2591339" url="?curid=543095" title="The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations">
<text>The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations is a descriptive list which was first proposed by Georges Polti in 1895 to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. Polti analyzed classical Greek texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction, Polti claims to be continuing the work of Carlo Gozzi (1720–1806), who also identified 36 situations.

==Publication history==

This list was published in a book of the same name, which contains extended explanations and examples. The original French-language book was written in 1895. An English translation was published in 1916 and continues to be reprinted.

The list was popularized as an aid for writers, but is also used by dramatists, storytellers and others. Other similar lists have since been made.

It influenced Christina Stead and George Pierce Baker, the author of &quot;Dramatic Technique&quot;. The 36 situations have been critiqued as being &quot;concatenations of events rather than minimal or isolable motifs&quot;.

== The 36 situations ==
Each situation is stated, then followed by the necessary elements for each situation and a brief description.

# Supplication
#* a persecutor; a ; a power in authority, whose decision is doubtful.
#* The suppliant appeals to the power in authority for deliverance from the persecutor. The power in authority may be a distinct person or be merely an attribute of the persecutor, e.g. a weapon suspended in their hand. The suppliant may also be two persons, the Persecuted and the Intercessor, an example of which is Esther interceding to the king on behalf of the Jews for deliverance from the king&#x27;s chief advisor. 
# Deliverance
#* an unfortunate; a threatener; a rescuer
#* The unfortunate has caused a conflict, and the threatener is to carry out justice, but the rescuer saves the unfortunate. &quot;Examples: Ifigenia in Tauride, Deliverance; Superman (1941 film)&quot; 
# Crime pursued by vengeance
#* a criminal; an avenger
#* The criminal commits a crime that will not see justice, so the avenger seeks justice by punishing the criminal. &quot;Example: The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;
# Vengeance taken for kin upon kin
#* Guilty Kinsman; an Avenging Kinsman; remembrance of the Victim, a relative of both. 
#* Two entities, the Guilty and the Avenging Kinsmen, are put into conflict over wrongdoing to the Victim, who is allied to both. &quot;Example: Hamlet&quot;
# Pursuit
#* punishment; a fugitive
#* the fugitive flees punishment for a misunderstood conflict. &quot;Example: Les Misérables, The Fugitive&quot;
# Disaster
#* a vanquished power; a victorious enemy &quot;or&quot; a messenger
#* The vanquished power falls from their place after being defeated by the victorious enemy or being informed of such a defeat by the messenger. &quot;Example: Agamemnon (play)&quot;
# Falling prey to cruelty/misfortune
#* an unfortunate; a master &quot;or&quot; a misfortune
#* The unfortunate suffers from misfortune and/or at the hands of the master. &quot;Example: Job (biblical figure)&quot;

#* a tyrant; a conspirator
#* The tyrant, a cruel power, is plotted against by the conspirator. &quot;Example: Julius Caesar (play)&quot;
# Daring enterprise
#* a bold leader; an object; an adversary
#* The bold leader takes the object from the adversary by overpowering the adversary. &quot;Example: Queste del Saint Graal; The Lord of the Rings; Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;
# Abduction
#* an abductor; the abducted; a guardian
#* The abductor takes the abducted from the guardian. &quot;Example: Helen of Troy&quot;
# The enigma
#* a problem; an interrogator; a seeker
#* The interrogator poses a problem to the seeker and gives a seeker better ability to reach the seeker&#x27;s goals. &quot;Example: Oedipus and the Sphinx&quot;
# Obtaining
#* (a Solicitor &amp; an adversary who is refusing) &quot;or&quot; (an arbitrator &amp; opposing parties)
#* The solicitor is at odds with the adversary who refuses to give the solicitor an object in the possession of the adversary, or an arbitrator decides who gets the object desired by opposing parties (the solicitor and the adversary). &quot;Example: Apple of Discord&quot;
# Enmity of kin
#* a Kinsman; a Hated &quot;or&quot; a reciprocally-hating Kinsman
#* The Malevolent Kinsman and the Hated or a second Malevolent Kinsman conspire together. &quot;Example: As You Like It&quot;
# Rivalry of kin
#* the Preferred Kinsman; the Kinsman; the Object of Rivalry
#* The Object of Rivalry chooses the Preferred Kinsman over the Rejected Kinsman. &quot;Example: Wuthering Heights&quot;
# Murderous adultery
#* two Adulterers; a Betrayed Spouse
#* Two Adulterers conspire to kill the Betrayed Spouse. &quot;Example: Clytemnestra, Aegisthus, Double Indemnity&quot;
# Madness
#* a Madman; a Victim
#* The Madman goes insane and wrongs the Victim. &quot;Example: The Shining (novel)&quot;
# imprudence
#* the Imprudent; a Victim &quot;or&quot; an Object Lost

<text>Stanford Research Park (SRP) is a technology park established in 1951 as a joint initiative between Stanford University and the City of Palo Alto. It was the world&#x27;s first university research park. It has more than 150 companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Tesla Motors, TIBCO and VMware; previous high-profile tenants include Steve Jobs&#x27;s NeXT Computer, Xerox PARC, and Facebook. It has been called &quot;an engine for Silicon Valley&quot; and &quot;the epicenter of Silicon Valley&quot;.

==Facilities==
The park covers a area and has 10 million square feet of commercial real estate in an area surrounding Page Mill Road, south west of El Camino Real and extending beyond Foothill Expressway to Arastradero Road. By January 2018, the park&#x27;s 140 buildings house over 150 different companies and their 23,000 employees. It is currently home to companies like Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, Tesla Motors, Nest, Skype, TIBCO and SAP. VMware is the park&#x27;s largest tenant as of January 2018. In 2016, SRP contributed an estimated $775 million in terms of economic activity to Palo Alto and approximately $2.4 billion to Santa Clara County. In 2016, SRP contributed more than $45 million in taxes (across local, state, and federal).

==History==

After World War II, Stanford University found itself in difficult financial circumstances. But given that it was rich in land, Stanford University Provost and Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman proposed a Stanford-affiliated and R&amp;D-focused business park that would generate income for Stanford as well as tax revenue for the Palo Alto community. Stanford University and the City of Palo Alto partnered to found the park, which was initially named Stanford Industrial Park. In 1951, the initiative was authorized and 209 acres were allocated. In 1953, Varian Associates moved in as the park&#x27;s first tenant.

In the early days, Stanford tightly controlled development, without the help of an outside developer. It also rigorously screened potential tenants to ensure they were in line with university objectives. By 1956, Hewlett-Packard established its world headquarters in SRP. The park acquired more land as it grew from 40 tenants in 1960 to 100 tenants in 1985 to over 150 by January 2018. The name was changed in the 1970s to Stanford Research Park to highlight &quot;the focus of cooperation between the university and the tech companies&quot;. In 1991, the Stanford Management Company was established to manage the university&#x27;s financial and real estate assets, including SRP.

===Controversies===

In 2014, the Palo Alto City Council allowed a proposed affordable housing community with 180 units in the Stanford Research Park to proceed, despite protests by neighborhood residents. The community opened in June 2017. In 2016, Stanford University and twelve of the park&#x27;s largest companies formed the Transportation Management Association in order to mitigate traffic congestion from employee commutes, noting that it was making companies within the park less attractive to current and prospective employees. SRP lacks a nearby Caltrain station. The group is exploring several options, including &quot;new shuttles, carpool routes and a trip-planning app&quot;.

==Tenants==
The following tenants currently have offices at the Stanford Research Park:

* Broadcom
* Tesla
* Dupont
* Ford
* HP
* Cooley LLP
* Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati

<doc id="543106" wikidata="Q636200" url="?curid=543106" title="Enzyme unit">
<text>The enzyme unit, or international unit for enzyme (symbol U, sometimes also IU) is a unit of enzyme&#x27;s catalytic activity. 

1 U (μmol/min) is defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one micromole of substrate per minute under the specified conditions of the assay method. 

The specified conditions will usually be the optimum conditions, including but not limited to temperature, pH, and substrate concentration, that yield the maximal substrate conversion rate for that particular enzyme. In some assay method, one usually takes a temperature of 25°C. 

The enzyme unit was adopted by the International Union of Biochemistry in 1964. Since the minute is not an SI base unit of time, the enzyme unit is discouraged in favor of the katal, the unit recommended by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1978 and officially adopted in 1999. 

One katal is the enzyme activity that converts one mole of substrate per second under specified assay conditions, so 

:1 U = 1 μmol/min = 1/60 μmol/s ≈ 16.67 nmol/s;
:16.67 nkat = 16.67 nmol/s;
:Therefore, 1 U = 16.67 nkat

While the katal may be recommended, almost all scientific research today still uses the system based on the minute, for the simple reason that enzyme assays are measured in minutes, not seconds. 

The concept of enzyme unit should not be confused with the one of international unit (IU). Although it is true that 1 U = 1 IU (because, for many enzymes, the existing U was adopted as the later IU), international units can be defined for the biologic activity of many other kinds of substance besides enzymes (for example, vitamins and hormones).

<text>Magma Design Automation was a software company in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The company was founded in 1997 and maintained headquarters in San Jose, California, with facilities throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Magma software products were used in major elements of integrated circuit design, including: synthesis, placement, routing, power management, circuit simulation, verification and analog/mixed-signal design.

Magma was acquired by Synopsys in a merger finalized February 22, 2012 at a cash value of about $523 million, or $7.35 per share.

==History==
Magma was founded in 1997 by a team including Rajeev Madhavan, who was chairman, CEO and president from the company&#x27;s inception. The company initially competed primarily with Cadence and Avanti Corporation in physical design but eventually broadened its product portfolio and competed with all three of the largest established EDA companies: Cadence, Mentor Graphics and Synopsys. Magma had a particularly strong presence in the convergence device segment through key customers such as Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments. In 2001 Roy Jewell joined Magma as chief operating officer and later that year added the title of president.

Magma completed an initial public offering on Nasdaq, under the ticker symbol LAVA, on November 20, 2001 — the last EDA company to go public — and achieved its peak annual revenue of $214.4 million in its 2008 fiscal year. Magma was the fourth largest EDA company by revenue.

In 2002 Magma was named to the Red Herring 100 for innovation and business strategy. In 2005 Forbes ranked Magma No. 2 on its list of fastest-growing technology companies.

===Patent Dispute===
Magma was involved in a legal dispute with Synopsys beginning in September 2004, when Synopsys sued Magma for allegedly infringing two patents. Claims and counter-claims accelerated, resulting in separate court cases in California and Delaware, and a number of disputed patents. On March 29, 2007, Magma and Synopsys announced the companies had agreed to settle all pending litigation between them. As part of the settlement Magma made a $12.5 million payment to Synopsys and each company cross-licensed four previously disputed patents to the other.

==Synopsys Acquisition==
On November 30, 2011, Magma and Synopsys announced they had entered into a definitive agreement by which Synopsys would buy Magma for $507 million US$. The merger was finalized on February 22, 2012, with cash value of the transaction at about $523 million, or $7.35 per Magma share.

<doc id="543109" wikidata="Q4711576" url="?curid=543109" title="Alberta Alliance Party">
<text>The Alberta Alliance was a right-wing provincial political party in Alberta, Canada. Many of its members were supporters of the defunct Canadian Alliance federal political party and its predecessor, the Reform Party of Canada. Members also joined from similar provincial fringe parties like the Alberta First Party, the Alberta Party and Social Credit. Alliance supporters tended to view themselves as &quot;true conservatives,&quot; and believed the Progressive Conservative governments of Premiers Ralph Klein and Ed Stelmach were out of touch with the needs of Albertans.

Paul Hinman was elected the party&#x27;s leader at a leadership convention held on November 19, 2005.

On January 19, 2008, the party voted to change its name to the Wildrose Alliance Party when it absorbed the unregistered Wildrose Party of Alberta.

==Early history==
The party was registered on October 25, 2002 and its founding convention was held for two days beginning on February 14, 2003, in Red Deer, Alberta.

Former Social Credit Party leader Randy Thorsteinson, was selected as the first leader of the party on the second day of the founding convention on February 15, 2003. Thorsteinson had experience in Alberta politics as he was leader of Social Credit from 1992 to 1999. He left the party in April 1999, in protest of an internal party proposal to limit the involvement of Mormons within the Party.
The Canadian Alliance (CA) never formed provincial wings or forged formal links with existing provincial parties. In the case of the CA&#x27;s predecessor, the Reform Party of Canada, an inactive Reform Party of Alberta had been formed by members of the federal party to keep the Reform name out of provincial politics. Unlike the Reform Party, the founders of the Alberta Alliance intended to form a very active party, and many members of the Alberta Alliance hoped the new party would be seen as the unofficial provincial wing of the CA.

The new party never sought a formal link with the CA, and had it done so, the overture would likely have been rebuffed, since many Albertan CA members continued to support the Progressive Conservatives. However, the Alberta Alliance used the same blue-and-green colours used by the CA, and its logo bears a striking resemblance to that of the federal party. The Alberta Alliance continued to grow following the Canadian Alliance&#x27;s merger with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to form the new Conservative Party of Canada.

The Alliance gained its first Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta (MLA) on June 29, 2004, when Gary Masyk crossed the floor, quitting the Progressive Conservative Party to protest Ralph Klein&#x27;s handling of health care issues during the 2004 federal election. Masyk had represented the electoral district of Edmonton-Norwood since 2001.

==2004 election campaign==
The Alliance nominated candidates in all 83 electoral divisions and three candidates for the senator-in-waiting, for the 2004 Alberta election, which was held on November 22, 2004. The party was excluded from Global Television Network&#x27;s leaders&#x27; debate because it had not elected any members in the 2001 election, which was held before the party was founded. Some Alliance members noted that in the 1997 election, the Alberta New Democratic Party leader was allowed in the debate (as was then Social Credit leader Thorsteinson), even though the NDP had no MLAs at the time. They also noted that the NDP did not even have a full slate of candidates in the 1997 election.

The Alliance hired an American firm, Campaign Secrets, to help run its campaign. Campaign Secrets, which has extensive experience working on Republican campaigns, produced advertisements that were criticized by some Albertans for employing &quot;U.S.-style&quot; negative campaign tactics. The Alliance leadership defended its use of American strategists, claiming that most right-leaning Albertan consultants were already hired by the well-heeled Tories.

===&quot;I Blame Ralph&quot;===
The Alberta Alliance Party devised a campaign strategy in September 2004 prior to election called &quot;I Blame Ralph&quot;, the purpose of which was to court voters who were uncomfortable with Ralph Klein&#x27;s behaviour, and highlight his tight controls over the government&#x27;s decision making.

The party kicked off the &quot;I Blame Ralph&quot; tour holding pre-election campaign events in numerous cities including opening its Campaign Headquarters in Red Deer. Part of the promotional package used by the party was bumper stickers a variety of fliers for different problems and a television ad, as well as T-shirts and a website. &quot;I Blame Ralph&quot; received significant attention, but did not include any of the standard Alberta Alliance logos or colours, instead using red and white leading many to believe the Liberals were responsible.

===Senate campaign===
The Alberta Alliance party ran three senator-in-waiting candidates in the 2004 Alberta Senate nominee election. The Alberta Alliance was the only party besides the Progressive Conservatives to successfully nominate candidates. The Social Credit Party had intended to run a candidate but failed to get the signatures required to field a candidate.

The candidates finished 7th 8th and 10th out of the field of 10 candidates in the block vote.

=== Legislature results ===
On election day, results for the party could be described as mixed. Most analysts did not expect the two-year-old party to seriously challenge the Progressive Conservative government. The party made a few in roads finishing second in a number of rural districts and a few respectable third place showing in Calgary.

The party&#x27;s lone incumbent MLA, Gary Masyk, was defeated running for re-election in the new electoral district of Edmonton Decore, placing a distant fourth. Masyk&#x27;s old electoral district Edmonton-Norwood had been merged in Edmonton Highlands, the district represented by popular New Democrat leader Brian Mason.

The party on the whole did very poorly in the urban ridings of Edmonton and Calgary. The Alliance appears to have played spoiler in some urban seats, siphoning off enough votes from the Tories that Liberals or New Democrats were elected.

The Alberta Alliance had its best results in rural seats. The party won a narrow victory in the Progressive Conservative stronghold of Cardston-Taber-Warner, where Paul Hinman became the first MLA elected under the Alliance banner, defeating incumbent Broyce Jacobs. In several others it managed to finish second. Party Leader Randy Thorsteinson placed second running in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake. The rural results were mixed, though -- it was badly defeated in other districts.

===Aftermath of the 2004 election===
On March 7, 2005, Thorsteinson announced his resignation as leader of the Alberta Alliance, citing that he would not be able to devote the time and energy into the party. He stepped down on April 15, 2005. A leadership convention was called for November 19, 2005. Eleanor Maroes was appointed leader by the Provincial Council to serve in the interim until the new leader was chosen.

==2005 leadership election==

The party replaced former leader Randy Thorsteinson in a two-day leadership convention held on November 18, and November 19, 2005 in Red Deer.

The nominations closed on September 20, 2005. Candidates were eligible if had been a party member for at least 90 days prior to the convention, obtain 100 signatures from party members in good standing, and provide a $5,000 deposit.

The Alberta Alliance had four candidates were nominated:

*Paul Hinman
*Marilyn Burns
*David Crutcher
*Ed Klop

Paul Hinman was elected as the party&#x27;s new leader on November 19, 2005, after a bitter leadership campaign. He was elected on the third ballot defeating Marilyn Burns.

==Merger talks==
Following the leadership convention, the party entered discussion about merging with the Social Credit Party of Alberta and re-entered merger talks with the Alberta Party in order to unite the political right in Alberta.

Merger talks with the Social Credit collapsed after a motion was put forward at the 2006 Social Credit policy convention to break off merger talks and focus on electing members in the next provincial election.

The Alberta Alliance Party and Alberta Party held their Annual General Meetings on March 23, 2007 and March 24, 2007, in Edmonton and Red Deer, respectively, to vote on a new party constitution that would have merged the parties. The new party would have kept the Alberta Alliance Party name and Paul Hinman as leader. Talks between the two parties had been on-going prior to the election in 2004. The Alberta Alliance party membership voted to withhold a potential merger until after the Alberta Party had resolved its legal troubles.

==2006 Progressive Conservative leadership election==
In an unorthodox political move, on October 11, 2006, Alliance leader Paul Hinman encouraged his party members to buy memberships in the rival Progressive Conservative Party and vote for candidate Ted Morton in the PC Party&#x27;s upcoming leadership race, as Morton is considered the candidate that is ideologically most in sync with Alliance philosophies.

The idea wasn&#x27;t well received by the provincial council and voted down.

It has been argued by some that parties such as Social Credit and Alberta Alliance could, with sufficient support, possibly threaten the now-traditional Progressive Conservative dominance in the province despite the much greater levels of support currently attained by parties such as the Liberal and New Democratic parties. The basis for such an argument is that both Social Credit and Alberta Alliance would most likely to compete for the &quot;rural vote&quot;- traditionally PC heartland. However, this has so far failed to materialize despite the promising showings by both parties in a number of ridings in recent elections.

==2007 by-elections==
The Alberta Alliance began its campaign for the Calgary Elbow and Drumheller-Stettler by-elections at the Annual General Meeting held on March 24, 2007. At that meeting, former party leader Randy Thorsteinson returned to the executive as the president of the party.

The Alberta Alliance party pinned its best hopes in picking up Drumheller-Stettler, a rural riding in central Alberta. The Alliance nominated Dave France, who had finished third as the candidate in the previous general election. In Calgary Elbow the party nominated its chief financial officer Jane Greydanus to stand as the candidate.

When the returns came back on June 12, 2007, Dave France finished a distant fifth place and there was a significant re-alignment of votes among the opposition parties. The Drumheller-Stettler seat was retained by the Progressive Conservatives. In Calgary Elbow the party managed a slight increase in its popular vote percent but failed to make a breakthrough. The party retained its previous fourth-place standing in the riding.

==Oil royalties==
After the release of the Oil Royalty Review Panel Final Report, the Alberta Alliance came out strongly in favour of petroleum producers. The party released a new website called &quot;Protect Our Prosperity&quot;, which sought to inform Albertans about the possible consequences for oil royalty increases.

==Merger with the Wildrose Party==
The Alberta Alliance membership voted on January 19, 2008 to merge with the upstart Wildrose Party to create the &quot;Wildrose Alliance&quot;. To effect the merger, the Alberta Alliance Party changed its name to the Wildrose Alliance Party of Alberta and allowed all members of the Wildrose Party of Alberta to exchange their membership in the Wildrose Party for a membership in the Wildrose Alliance for the unexpired term. The new party adopted bylaws substantially the same as those of the Wildrose Party of Alberta, and immediately conducted an election of officers. The Wildrose Alliance accepted all the assets and liabilities of the Wildrose Party of Alberta.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes mystery story written in collaboration by Adrian Conan Doyle (the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator) and John Dickson Carr. The story was published in the 1954 collection, &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 6 June 1953, illustrated by Robert Fawcett.

==Plot==
The overbearing wife of James Cabpleasure demands that Holmes investigate the abnormal attachment her husband has to an ordinary umbrella. Gloria Cabpleasure has gone to the trouble of having a mechanic examine the umbrella for any secret compartment. Holmes and Watson discover that Mrs. Cabpleasure has even gone to the police, and Inspector Lestrade is investigating Mr. Cabpleasure also. While conducting surveillance on the Cabpleasure home, everyone observes James Cabpleasure emerge from his front door, go back for his umbrella, and then vanish completely, along with valuable diamonds from his company.

<text>In statistics, rankits of a set of data are the expected values of the order statistics of a sample from the standard normal distribution the same size as the data. They are primarily used in the normal probability plot, a graphical technique for normality testing.

==Example==

This is perhaps most readily understood by means of an example. If an i.i.d. sample of six items is taken from a normally distributed population with expected value 0 and variance 1 (the standard normal distribution) and then sorted into increasing order, the expected values of the resulting order statistics are:

:−1.2672,   −0.6418,   −0.2016,   0.2016,   0.6418,   1.2672.

Suppose the numbers in a data set are

: 65, 75, 16, 22, 43, 40.

Then one may sort these and line them up with the corresponding rankits; in order they are
: 16, 22, 40, 43, 65, 75,
which yields the points:
These points are then plotted as the vertical and horizontal coordinates of a scatter plot.

=== Alternative method ===
Alternatively, rather than &quot;sort&quot; the data points, one may &quot;rank&quot; them, and &quot;rearrange&quot; the rankits accordingly. This yields the same pairs of numbers, but in a different order.

For:
: 65, 75, 16, 22, 43, 40,
the corresponding ranks are:
: 5, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3,

i.e., the number appearing first is the 5th-smallest, the number appearing second is 6th-smallest, the number appearing third is smallest, the number appearing fourth is 2nd-smallest, etc. One rearranges the expected normal order statistics accordingly, getting the rankits of this data set:

==Rankit plot==

A graph plotting the rankits on the horizontal axis and the data points on the vertical axis is called a rankit plot or a normal probability plot. Such a plot is necessarily nondecreasing. In large samples from a normally distributed population, such a plot will approximate a straight line. Substantial deviations from straightness are considered evidence against normality of the distribution. 

Rankit plots are usually used to visually demonstrate whether data are from a specified probability distribution.

A rankit plot is a kind of Q–Q plot – it plots the order statistics (quantiles) of the sample against certain quantiles (the rankits) of the assumed normal distribution. Q–Q plots may use other quantiles for the normal distribution, however.

==History==
The rankit plot and the word rankit was introduced by the biologist and statistician Chester Ittner Bliss (1899–1979).

<text>An oral consonant is a consonant sound in speech that is made by allowing air to escape from the mouth, as opposed to the nose, as in a nasal consonant. To create an intended oral consonant sound, the entire mouth plays a role in modifying the air&#x27;s passageway. This rapid modification of the air passageway using the tongue and lips makes changes to the waveform of the sound by compressing and expanding the air. In addition to the nose and mouth, the vocal cords and lungs also make a contribution to producing speech by controlling the volume (amplitude) and pitch (frequency) of the sound. The use of the vocal cords will also determine whether the consonant is voiced or voiceless. The vast majority of consonants are oral, such as, for example , , and . The others are nasal, such as the nasal occlusives or .

<doc id="543119" wikidata="Q432581" url="?curid=543119" title="Normal probability plot">
<text>The normal probability plot is a graphical technique to identify substantive departures from normality. This includes identifying outliers, skewness, kurtosis, a need for transformations, and mixtures. Normal probability plots are made of raw data, residuals from model fits, and estimated parameters.

In a normal probability plot (also called a &quot;normal plot&quot;), the sorted data are plotted vs. values selected to make the resulting image look close to a straight line if the data are approximately normally distributed. Deviations from a straight line suggest departures from normality. The plotting can be manually performed by using a special graph paper, called &quot;normal probability paper&quot;. With modern computers normal plots are commonly made with software.

The normal probability plot is a special case of the Q–Q probability plot for a normal distribution. The theoretical quantiles are generally chosen to approximate either the mean or the median of the corresponding order statistics.

==Definition==
The normal probability plot is formed by plotting the sorted data vs. an approximation to the means or medians of the corresponding order statistics; see rankit. Some plot the data on the vertical axis; others plot the data on the horizontal axis.

Different sources use slightly different approximations for rankits. The formula used by the &quot;qqnorm&quot; function in the basic &quot;stats&quot; package in R (programming language) is as follows:

: formula_1

for , 
where

: if and 
::0.5 for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 10,

and is the standard normal quantile function.

If the data are consistent with a sample from a normal distribution, the points should lie close to a straight line. As a reference, a straight line can be fit to the points. The further the points vary from this line, the greater the indication of departure from normality. If the sample has mean 0, standard deviation 1 then a line through 0 with slope 1 could be used.

With more points, random deviations from a line will be less pronounced. Normal plots are often used with as few as 7 points, e.g., with plotting the effects in a saturated model from a 2-level fractional factorial experiment. With fewer points, it becomes harder to distinguish between random variability and a substantive deviation from normality.

==Other distributions==

Probability plots for distributions other than the normal are computed in exactly the same way. The normal quantile function is simply replaced by the quantile function of the desired distribution. In this way, a probability plot can easily be generated for any distribution for which one has the quantile function.

With a location-scale family of distributions, the location and scale parameters of the distribution can be estimated from the intercept and the slope of the line. For other distributions the parameters must first be estimated before a probability plot can be made.

==Plot types==
This is a sample of size 50 from a normal distribution, plotted as both a histogram, and a normal probability plot.

This is a sample of size 50 from a right-skewed distribution, plotted as both a histogram, and a normal probability plot.

This is a sample of size 50 from a uniform distribution, plotted as both a histogram, and a normal probability plot.

<doc id="543123" wikidata="Q1851269" url="?curid=543123" title="Central consonant">
<text>A central consonant, also known as a median consonant, is a consonant sound that is produced when air flows across the center of the mouth over the tongue. The class contrasts with lateral consonants, in which air flows over the sides of the tongue rather than down its center.

Examples of central consonants are the voiced alveolar fricative (the &quot;z&quot; in the English word &quot;zoo&quot;) and the palatal approximant (the &quot;y&quot; in the English word &quot;yes&quot;). Others are the central fricatives , the central approximants , the trills , and the central flaps . 

The term is most relevant for approximants and fricatives (for which there are contrasting lateral and central consonants - e.g. versus and versus ). Stops that have &quot;lateral release&quot; can be written in the International Phonetic Alphabet using a superscript symbol, e.g. , or can be implied by a following lateral consonant, e.g. . The labial fricatives often—perhaps usually—have lateral airflow, as occlusion between the teeth and lips blocks the airflow in the center, but nonetheless they are not considered lateral consonants because no language makes a distinction between the two.

In some languages, the centrality of a phoneme may be indeterminate. In Japanese, for example, there is a liquid phoneme , which may be either central or lateral, resulting in /ro/ produced as either or .

<doc id="543124" wikidata="Q826579" url="?curid=543124" title="Bernie Parent">
<text>Bernard Marcel Parent (born April 3, 1945) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played 13 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers, Boston Bruins, and Toronto Maple Leafs between 1965 and 1979, and also spent one season in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Philadelphia Blazers during the 1972–73 season. Parent is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time.

During the 1973–74 and 1974–75 seasons, in what many consider the finest consecutive seasons ever by a goaltender, the Flyers won the Stanley Cup twice and Parent won the Vezina Trophy and Conn Smythe Trophy both seasons. In that two-year run of dominance, Parent posted 30 shutouts in regular and post season play combined. A 1984 inductee into the Hockey Hall of Fame, Parent was rated number 63 on The Hockey News&#x27; list of &quot;The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time&quot; in 1998. Parent remains an iconic fan favorite in Philadelphia more than three decades after his retirement. In 2017 Parent was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Early years==
Parent is the youngest of seven siblings. He grew up in Rosemont, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal. Parent&#x27;s hero as a young boy was Montreal Canadiens goalie Jacques Plante, whose sister lived in Parent&#x27;s neighbourhood. Many times Parent watched out for Plante&#x27;s visits to his sister and her family. Plante later became his teammate and mentor in 1971 for the Toronto Maple Leafs, when Plante was 43.

As a Québécois, Parent&#x27;s use of English was a never-ending source of locker room and bus trip humour, especially when he was excited. During his early playing career, Parent did not conduct interviews in English for fear of saying the wrong things.

==Playing career==
Parent played for the Niagara Falls Flyers of the OHA Junior A league. A two-time winner of the Dave Pinkney Trophy (lowest goals-against average or GAA), he wrapped up his junior career on the team that won the OHA championship and the Memorial Cup championship in 1965.

Parent began his career with the Boston Bruins in the 1965–66 season, appearing in 39 games. The following season was split between Boston and the Bruins&#x27; farm club in Oklahoma.

Left unprotected for the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft, Parent was chosen by the Philadelphia Flyers where he and Doug Favell, another former Bruin prospect, split the netminding duties for the Flyers&#x27; first season. Parent recorded a 2.48 GAA with four shutouts and the Flyers finished first in the NHL&#x27;s West Division. Over the next two seasons, with Favell performing inconsistently or injured, Parent became the Flyers&#x27; #1 goalie and appeared in 58 and 62 games for the Flyers achieving impressive Save Percentages of .925 and .921, although due to the weakness of the Flyers who allowed a lot of shots, his GAA and win totals were not nearly as impressive.

Looking for help up front to improve the club&#x27;s offence, Philadelphia dealt Parent and a second-round pick in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft (Rick Kehoe) to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Bruce Gamble and a first-round selection (Pierre Plante) in the same draft in a three-way transaction that also involved Boston on January 31, 1971. The Flyers acquired Rick MacLeish and Danny Schock from the Bruins who received Mike Walton from the Maple Leafs. The trade turned out to be a positive turn for Parent. In Toronto, Parent joined his boyhood hero, Jacques Plante, who at 42 was having an all-star season. Under Plante&#x27;s tutelage, Parent became a more consistent and technically proficient goalie. Parent played well for the Leafs through the 1971–72 season, gaining valuable regular season and playoff experience.
Without a contract with the Leafs for the 1972–73 season, Parent signed a large contract with the Miami Screaming Eagles of the newly forming World Hockey Association. He was the first NHL player to jump to the new league. The Eagles did not materialize as planned, and Parent signed with the Philadelphia Blazers. Parent faced a barrage of shots in 63 regular-season games for the Blazers in the defensively weak league. After leaving the team over a contract dispute during the 1973 WHA playoffs, he sought a return to the NHL but did not wish to return to the Leafs. Toronto traded Parent&#x27;s NHL rights back to the Flyers for Favell and a first-round pick in that summer&#x27;s (1973) amateur draft.

The next two seasons were the greatest of his career and would see Parent record a combined 30 regular and post-season shutout victories. Hockey scribes have often cited Parent&#x27;s play between 1973 and 1975 as some of the best ever by a goaltender. Playing 73 games in a 78-game schedule, Parent sparkled in leading the league with a 1.89 GAA, a .933 Save Percentage and 12 shutouts. He began the 1973–74 season with two shutouts besting Favell 2–0 in the season opener against Toronto in Philadelphia. He shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago&#x27;s Tony Esposito (as Philadelphia and Chicago tied as the teams allowing the fewest goals against in the regular season), was named the first-team all-star goaltender and finished second in the voting for the Hart Trophy as the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (since 1963 the only goaltenders to win the Hart Trophy have been Dominik Hašek in both 1996–97 and 1997–98, Jose Theodore in 2002, and Carey Price in 2015) as the Flyers skated to a first-place finish in the West Division. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff MVP) and the Flyers won the first of consecutive Stanley Cup Championships against the Boston Bruins. In the 6th and deciding game of the finals, Parent stopped a savage slapshot blast from Ken Hodge with a classic kick save move with less than 3 minutes to play on what turned out to be the Bruins&#x27; 30th and last shot. The spectacular save preserved the shutout and the championship-deciding win and became an often used highlight during advertising for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the NHL the next season. The following year, he again posted 12 shutouts while having 2.03 GAA and a .918 Save Percentage. He won another Vezina Trophy, another first-team all-star selection and a second Conn Smythe Trophy and Stanley Cup while finishing fourth in the Hart Trophy voting. His 1975 playoff performance was even more impressive than the previous year as he had 4 shutouts (versus 2 the previous year) with a 1.89 GAA (versus 2.02). In both championship playoff runs, Parent shut out the opposition in the deciding sixth game of the Stanley Cup Finals defeating the Boston Bruins 1–0 in 1974 and the Buffalo Sabres 2–0 in 1975. &quot;Only the Lord saves more than Bernie Parent&quot; became a catch-phrase and bumper sticker in Philadelphia in those years.

As the Flyers prepared a run at the championship for a third consecutive year, Parent was sidelined by a pre-season neck injury requiring surgery and he appeared in only 11 games in 1975–76. Parent had pinched a nerve in his neck causing radiating pain. Doctors removed a disk and a section of bone hoping to alleviate the symptoms but Parent suffered from continued pain in his neck throughout the rest of his career. He returned to the lineup late in the season but he was inconsistent and could not regain the starting job from netminder Wayne Stephenson. Without Parent&#x27;s Conn Smythe level performance that year, the Flyers fell in the Stanley Cup finals in four straight games to the Montreal Canadiens. Over the next three seasons, he experienced difficulties at times. Hockey was changing from a defense-oriented game to one that favored high scoring. Snipers like Mike Bossy, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne were becoming major stars and dominating play. Plante, although in retirement, continued to have a strong influence on Parent&#x27;s career. Parent, like Plante, was a stand-up type goalie. At one point Parent was playing poorly and considering retirement. Plante watched him practice in Philadelphia for two days, then told Parent exactly what he was doing wrong: sitting back on his heels, backing into his crease and losing concentration. Parent heeded Plante&#x27;s advice and returned to form. During the 1977–1978 season, he adopted the more confident, challenging style characteristic of his play during the Championship years posting a 2.22 GAA, a 0.912 save percentage and a league-leading 7 shutouts in 49 games. However, as the 1970s were drawing to a close, the era of the stand-up goaltender was coming to an end. The never-before-seen goal-scoring totals of the early 1980s eventually forced a revolution in goaltender style and play. The butterfly style of Patrick Roy became the dominant style and the stand-up style of Parent and Plante became a relic of the NHL past. Parent is considered by many to be the last great stand-up goaltender.

On February 17, 1979, Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury in a game against the New York Rangers. An errant stick entered the right eye hole of his mask, causing permanent damage to his vision. After hospitalization, including the complete loss of sight for two weeks, Parent recovered and eventually regained sight, although not at the level required to resume his playing career. He retired at age 34, an age considered to be &quot;still in athletic prime&quot; for goaltenders. This incident, as well as the ending of Gerry Desjardins&#x27; career when a puck struck his eye in 1977, led many NHL goalies to switch from fibreglass facemasks toward the cage and helmet style, and resulted in many amateur and junior leagues banning fibreglass masks altogether, mandating the helmet/cage combo.

==Post-career==
After Parent&#x27;s retirement the Flyers retired his sweater number (1) in his honor on October 11, 1979. He spent several years in the Flyers organization as goaltending coach, mentoring future Vezina-winning goalies Ron Hextall and the late Pelle Lindbergh, the latter of whom idolized Parent as a youngster in his native Sweden. Today, he is employed by the Flyers as Ambassador of Hockey. He can be seen at Flyers home games on the concourse.

Unable to deal with the early loss of his career, Parent turned to alcohol and eventually ended up in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous. He has been sober for well over 30 years.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine, Parent sheepishly admitted he was watching the clock tick off the final seconds of the deciding game six against Boston in the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals and that he was not paying attention to play when Bobby Orr sent a desperation length of the ice shot toward the Flyers&#x27; goaltender. The puck went wide of the net with just 4 seconds to play. &quot;If his shot is on net, it&#x27;s a goal&quot; Parent was quoted in the interview. The game was over seconds later and the Flyers had won their first of consecutive championships.

Parent remains one of the most popular and iconic Flyers from their two championship teams with hockey fans in Philadelphia. Chants of &quot;Bernie...Bernie...Bernie&quot; that rocked the Philadelphia Spectrum during the team&#x27;s championship years still greet Parent when he is recognized at current Flyer&#x27;s events.

Parent was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1998, he was ranked number 63 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

Parent has been a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey and had a shore house in Wildwood Crest, where he lived most of the years. For seven months of every year, he lives on his 45-foot yacht named &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

On December 7, 2011, Parent announced via Twitter that he would be playing in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic Alumni Game, to be held on December 31, 2011. Parent started in goal for the Flyers, playing five minutes and letting in no goals on five shots including a breakaway by New York Rangers legend Ron Duguay. He was later named the first star of the game.

Recently, Parent made an appearance on The Philly Sports Convo podcast, hosted by Philadelphia broadcaster Jason Lee. The episode, which aired on December 6, 2023, showcased Bernie&#x27;s enduring passion for the game and his unique perspective on the world of sports. As he occasionally graces podcasts and shows, Bernie Parent remains a beloved figure, connecting with audiences through his charismatic presence and wealth of hockey wisdom.

<doc id="543125" wikidata="Q17022503" url="?curid=543125" title="Brake (sheet metal bending)">
<text>A brake is a metalworking machine that allows the bending of sheet metal. A cornice brake only allows for simple bends and creases, while a box-and-pan brake also allows one to form box and pan shapes. It is also known as a bending machine or bending brake or in Britain as a sheet metal folder or just a folder.

==Description==
The brake consists of a flat surface onto which the material is placed, and a clamping bar which will come down and hold the material firmly during the bend. This clamping action may be manual, automatic or operated using a foot pedal. The front, gate-like, plate of the machine is hinged and may be lifted, forcing the material extended over a straight edge to bend to follow the plate.

The bends can be to any angle up to a practical limit of about 120 degrees, somewhat more in the case of a bar folder. If the area to be bent is narrow enough, a sharper bend (e.g., for a hem) can be made by inserting the bend under the clamping bar and lowering it.

===Box-and-pan brake===
In a box-and-pan brake (also known as a finger brake), the clamping bar includes several removable blocks, which may be removed and rearranged to permit bending of restricted areas of a piece of sheet metal or of already partially formed pieces.

After bending, the box or pan form is then completed by screw, solder, weld, rivet, or other metal fixing process.

===Bar folder===
A bar folder is a simplified brake, usually much smaller than a cornice or box-and-pan brake. Typically, a single handle both clamps the workpiece and makes the bend, in a single motion. There is a gauge that can be set up to a depth up to one inch for consistent bends.

Examples of items a bar folder is used to fabricate would be end caps, &quot;s&quot; cleats, and drive cleats.

===Press brake===
This is a more complex tool that forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die.

==Sizes==
Brakes come in sizes suitable for light aluminum or brass for small boxes and operated by hand, up to industrial sized and counterweighted hand-operated or hydraulic machines suitable for large sheets of steel.

<text>The complement system, also known as complement cascade, is a part of the humoral, innate immune system and enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen&#x27;s cell membrane. Despite being part of the innate immune system, the complement system can be recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system.

The complement system consists of a number of small, inactive, liver synthesized protein precursors circulating in the blood. When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of this &quot;complement activation&quot; or &quot;complement fixation&quot; cascade is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex. About 50 proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system, including plasma proteins, and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 10% of the globulin fraction of blood serum.

Three biochemical pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway. The alternative pathway accounts for the majority of terminal pathway activation and so therapeutic efforts in disease have revolved around its inhibition.

== History ==
In 1888, George Nuttall found that sheep blood serum had mild killing activity against the bacterium that causes anthrax. The killing activity disappeared when he heated the blood. In 1891, Hans Ernst August Buchner, noting the same property of blood in his experiments, named the killing property &quot;alexin&quot;, which means &quot;to ward off&quot; in Greek. By 1894, several laboratories had demonstrated that serum from guinea pigs that had recovered from cholera killed the cholera bacterium &quot;in vitro&quot;. Heating the serum destroyed its killing activity. Nevertheless, the heat-inactivated serum, when injected into guinea pigs exposed to the cholera bacteria, maintained its ability to protect the animals from illness. Jules Bordet, a young Belgian scientist in Paris at the Pasteur Institute, concluded that this principle has two components, one that maintained a &quot;sensitizing&quot; effect after being heated and one (alexin) whose toxic effect was lost after being heated. The heat-stable component was responsible for immunity against specific microorganisms, whereas the heat-sensitive component was responsible for the non-specific antimicrobial activity conferred by all normal sera. In 1899, Paul Ehrlich renamed the heat-sensitive component &quot;complement&quot;.

Ehrlich introduced the term &quot;complement&quot; as part of his larger theory of the immune system. According to this theory, the immune system consists of cells that have specific receptors on their surface to recognize antigens. Upon immunization with an antigen, more of these receptors are formed, and they are then shed from the cells to circulate in the blood. Those receptors, which we now call &quot;antibodies&quot;, were called by Ehrlich &quot;amboceptors&quot; to emphasise their bifunctional binding capacity: They recognise and bind to a specific antigen, but they also recognise and bind to the heat-labile antimicrobial component of fresh serum. Ehrlich, therefore, named this heat-labile component &quot;complement&quot;, because it is something in the blood that &quot;complements&quot; the cells of the immune system. Ehrlich believed that each antigen-specific amboceptor has its own specific complement, whereas Bordet believed that there is only one type of complement. In the early 20th century, this controversy was resolved when it became understood that complement can act in combination with specific antibodies, or on its own in a non-specific way.

== Functions ==

Complement triggers the following immune functions:
# Membrane attack – by rupturing the cell wall of bacteria. (classical complement pathway)
# Phagocytosis – by opsonizing antigens. C3b has most important opsonizing activity. (alternative complement pathway)
# Inflammation – by attracting macrophages and neutrophils. (lectin pathway)

== Overview ==

Most of the proteins and glycoproteins that constitute the complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinary system and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen-antibody complexes for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by spontaneous complement component 3 (C3) hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. C3b binds to the surface of pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.

In the alternative pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also formed by the classical pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2b. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted ) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9. MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade can be found in species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.
=== Classical pathway ===

The classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or &quot;C1qr2s2&quot;. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave C1s (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b (historically, the larger fragment of C2 was called C2a but is now referred to as C2b). C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b later joins with C4b2b to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex).

=== Alternative pathway ===

The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level, analogous to a car engine at idle, as a result of spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The alternative pathway does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways. C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by factor H and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase.

The C3bBb complex is stabilized by binding oligomers of factor P (properdin). The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, some of which becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b. This newly bound C3b recruits more B, D and P activity and greatly amplifies the complement activation. When complement is activated on a cell surface, the activation is limited by endogenous complement regulatory proteins, which include CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59, depending on the cell. Pathogens, in general, don&#x27;t have complement regulatory proteins (there are many exceptions, which reflect adaptation of microbial pathogens to vertebrate immune defenses). Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self on the basis of the surface expression of complement regulatory proteins. Host cells don&#x27;t accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement regulatory proteins, while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b. Accordingly, the alternative complement pathway is one element of innate immunity.

Once the alternative C3 convertase enzyme is formed on a pathogen or cell surface, it may bind covalently another C3b, to form C3bBbC3bP, the C5 convertase. This enzyme then cleaves C5 to C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, and C5b. The C5b then recruits and assembles C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9 molecules to assemble the membrane attack complex. This creates a hole or pore in the membrane that can kill or damage the pathogen or cell.

=== Lectin pathway ===

The lectin pathway is homologous to the classical pathway, but with the opsonin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and ficolins, instead of C1q. This pathway is activated by binding of MBL to mannose residues on the pathogen surface, which activates the MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1, and MASP-2 (very similar to C1r and C1s, respectively), which can then split C4 into C4a and C4b and C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2b then bind together to form the classical C3-convertase, as in the classical pathway. Ficolins are homologous to MBL and function via MASP in a similar way. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in M-ficolin in humans, with effect on ligand-binding ability and serum levels. Historically, the larger fragment of C2 was named C2a, but it is now referred to as C2b. In invertebrates without an adaptive immune system, ficolins are expanded and their binding specificities diversified to compensate for the lack of pathogen-specific recognition molecules.

=== Complement protein fragment nomenclature ===
Immunology textbooks have used different naming assignments for the smaller and larger fragments of C2 as C2a and C2b. The preferred assignment appears to be that the smaller fragment be designated as C2a: as early as 1994, a well known textbook recommended that the larger fragment of C2 should be designated C2b. However, this was amplified in their 1999 4th edition, to say that:
&quot;It is also useful to be aware that the larger active fragment of C2 was originally designated C2a, and is still called that in some texts and research papers. Here, for consistency, we shall call all large fragments of complement b, so the larger fragment of C2 will be designated C2b. In the classical and lectin pathways the C3 convertase enzyme is formed from membrane-bound C4b with C2b.&quot;

This nomenclature is used in another literature:
The assignment is mixed in the latter literature, though.
Some sources designate the larger and smaller fragments as C2a and C2b respectively while other sources apply the converse. However, due to the widely established convention, C2b here is the larger fragment, which, in the classical pathway, forms C4b2b (classically C4b2a). It may be noteworthy that, in a series of editions of Janeway&#x27;s book, 1st to 7th, in the latest edition they withdraw the stance to indicate the larger fragment of C2 as C2b.

=== Viral inhibition ===
Fixation of the MBL protein on viral surfaces has also been shown to enhance neutralization of viral pathogens.

=== Review ===
== Activation of complements by antigen-associated antibody ==
In the classical pathway, C1 binds with its C1q subunits to Fc fragments (made of CH2 region) of IgG or IgM, which has formed a complex with antigens. C4b and C3b are also able to bind to antigen-associated IgG or IgM, to its Fc portion.

Such immunoglobulin-mediated binding of the complement may be interpreted as that the complement uses the ability of the immunoglobulin to detect and bind to non-self antigens as its guiding stick. The complement itself can bind non-self pathogens after detecting their pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), however, utilizing specificity of the antibody, complements can detect non-self targets much more specifically.

Some components have a variety of binding sites. In the classical pathway, C4 binds to Ig-associated C1q and C1r2s2 enzyme cleaves C4 to C4b and 4a. C4b binds to C1q, antigen-associated Ig (specifically to its Fc portion), and even to the microbe surface. C3b binds to antigen-associated Ig and to the microbe surface. Ability of C3b to bind to antigen-associated Ig would work effectively against antigen-antibody complexes to make them soluble.

== Regulation ==
The complement system has the potential to be extremely damaging to host tissues, meaning its activation must be tightly regulated. The complement system is regulated by complement control proteins, which are present at blood plasma and host cell membrane. Some complement control proteins are present on the membranes of self-cells preventing them from being targeted by complement. One example is CD59, also known as protectin, which inhibits C9 polymerization during the formation of the membrane attack complex. The classical pathway is inhibited by C1-inhibitor, which binds to C1 to prevent its activation. Another example, is a plasma protein called, Factor H (FH), which has a key role in down-regulating the alternative pathway. Factor H, along with another protein called Factor I, inactivates C3b, the active form of C3. This process prevents the formation of C3 convertase and halts the progression of the complement cascade. C3-convertase also can be inhibited by decay accelerating factor (DAF), which is bound to erythrocyte plasma membranes via a GPI anchor.

== Role in disease ==

=== Complement deficiency ===

It is thought that the complement system might play a role in many diseases with an immune component, such as Barraquer–Simons syndrome, asthma, lupus erythematosus, glomerulonephritis, various forms of arthritis, autoimmune heart disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and ischemia-reperfusion injuries, and rejection of transplanted organs.

Complement regulation is suggested to play a role in pregnancy. Improper alternative complement pathway activation may mediate recurrent immune-mediated fetal loss.

The complement system is also becoming increasingly implicated in diseases of the central nervous system such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions such as spinal cord injuries.

Deficiencies of the terminal pathway predispose to both autoimmune disease and infections (particularly Neisseria meningitidis, due to the role that the membrane attack complex (&quot;MAC&quot;) plays in attacking Gram-negative bacteria).

Infections with &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; are the only conditions known to be associated with deficiencies in the MAC components of complement. 40–50% of those with MAC deficiencies experience recurrent infections with &quot;N. meningitidis&quot;.

=== Deficiencies in complement regulators ===

Mutations in the genes of complement regulators, especially factor H, have been associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and C3 glomerulopathy. Both of these disorders are currently thought to be due to complement overactivation either on the surface of host cells or in plasma, with the molecular location of genetic variation in complement proteins providing clues into the underlying disease processes. Moreover, several single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations in the complement factor H gene (the most common of which results in the protein change p.Y402H) have been associated with the common eye disease age-related macular degeneration. Polymorphisms of complement component 3, complement factor B, and complement factor I, as well as deletion of complement factor H-related 3 and complement factor H-related 1, also affect a person&#x27;s risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.

Mutations in the C1 inhibitor gene can cause hereditary angioedema, a genetic condition resulting from reduced regulation of bradykinin by C1-INH.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by complement breakdown of RBCs due to an inability to make GPI. Thus the RBCs are not protected by GPI anchored proteins such as DAF.

=== Diagnostic tools ===
Diagnostic tools to measure complement activity include the total complement activity test.

The presence or absence of complement fixation upon a challenge can indicate whether particular antigens or antibodies are present in the blood. This is the principle of the complement fixation test.

== Modulation of the body by complement with infection ==
Excessive complement activity contributes to severe Covid-19 symptoms and disease. Although complement is intended to protect the body systems, under stress there can be more damage than protection. Research has suggested that the complement system is manipulated during HIV/AIDS, in a way that further damages the body.

== Role in the brain ==
Research from over the last decade has shown that complement proteins of the classical complement pathway have an important role in synaptic pruning in the brain during early development.

<text>William Stevens Fielding, (24 November 1848 – 23 June 1929) was a Canadian Liberal politician, the seventh premier of Nova Scotia (1884–96), and the federal Minister of Finance from 1896 to 1911 and again from 1921 to 1925.

==Early life==
He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fielding became leader of the Anti-Confederation Party (Nova Scotia Liberal Party). In 1884, he became Premier and won the 1886 election on a pledge to remove Nova Scotia from confederation. When he failed to do this, he turned to economic matters including developing the coal industry.

The Liberal Party of Nova Scotia fared poorly in national elections during the 1880s and early 1890s. The national party advocated policies that would discontinue the national coal subsidy and, for all practical purposes, eliminate Catholic schools in Manitoba, policies disliked by provincial coal miners and Catholics respectively. Fielding forged a more moderate coal policy and defused the school issue, winning back Catholics. Thus in 1896 the provincial Liberals improved their showing in the national election.

==Federal politics==

In 1896, he left provincial politics to become Minister of Finance in the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In 1910, he negotiated a reciprocity or free trade agreement with the United States which led to the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1911 general election. Fielding lost his seat, and became editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of Montreal.

==First World War==

Fielding supported the Unionist government of Sir Robert Borden during the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and returned to the House of Commons as a Liberal-Unionist member.

==Liberal leadership convention, 1919==

Fielding had widely been seen as Laurier&#x27;s successor but his split with the party over the conscription issue cost him the 1919 Liberal leadership convention where he lost to William Lyon Mackenzie King by 38 votes.

==Service in Mackenzie King&#x27;s first Administration==
He served again as Minister of Finance in King&#x27;s first government formed after the 1921 election. Fielding&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in the years after the election, and while he nominally remained as Finance Minister through King&#x27;s first parliamentary term, Minister of Trade and Commerce James Robb effectively took over the role from late 1923 onwards. King&#x27;s government fell in September 1925 when parliament unexpectedly voted to reject that year&#x27;s budget. Fielding, recognising that he would likely not survive another full parliamentary term and that his political career was at its end, publicly took responsibility for the rejection of the budget, announcing his resignation as Finance Minister and that he would not seek re-election, saving Robb (who had actually been responsible for getting the budget passed) from having to resign.

==Later life==

In 1923, Fielding was sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom allowing him to be styled as Right Honourable, a rare privilege among Canadians who have not served as Prime Minister, Governor-General, or Chief Justice of Canada.

He died in Ottawa.

<doc id="543142" wikidata="Q1210978" url="?curid=543142" title="The Pelican Brief">
<text>The Pelican Brief is a legal-suspense thriller by John Grisham, published in 1992 by Doubleday. It is his third novel after &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; and &quot;The Firm&quot;. Two paperback editions were published, both by Dell Publishing in 1993. A namesake film adaptation was released in 1993 starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington.

==Plot==
The story begins with the assassinations of two ideologically divergent Supreme Court justices. Both murders are committed by Khamel, the most wanted hitman in the world. Justice Rosenberg, a liberal, is killed at his home while Justice Jensen, a Republican-appointed swing voter, is killed inside a gay movie theater in Washington, D.C. The circumstances surrounding their deaths, as well as the deaths themselves, shock and confuse a politically divided nation.

Darby Shaw, a Tulane University law student, conducts research on Rosenberg and Jensen&#x27;s records and writes a legal brief speculating they were not killed for political reasons. She shows the brief to Thomas Callahan, her law professor and lover, who in turn shows it to his friend, an FBI lawyer, Gavin Verheek. Soon afterwards, Callahan is killed by a car bomb, while Shaw, who witnesses his death, is contacted at the scene by suspicious people. Afraid that she is the next target, Shaw goes on the run. She contacts and agrees to meet Verheek, but Khamel murders Verheek and impersonates him when they meet. He is just about to kill Shaw when he is shot by an unknown person, so she manages to escape again.

Gray Grantham, a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, is contacted by an informant calling himself &quot;Garcia&quot;, who believes he has seen something in his law office that is related to the assassinations. However, Garcia is reluctant to come forward. Shaw shows her findings to Grantham, believing that the assassinations were committed on behalf of Victor Mattiece, an oil tycoon who seeks to drill on Louisiana marshland which is home to an endangered species of pelican. A case that would decide whether Mattiece can gain access to the land is expected to be heard before the Supreme Court. Despite their status as ideological opposites, the two slain justices had a single characteristic in common: a history of environmentalism, causing Shaw to surmise that Mattiece orchestrated their murders to make sure their replacements would be appointed by the current president, a hardline reactionary. Grantham agrees to help Shaw prove her suspicion is correct.

The president and his Chief of Staff, Fletcher Coal, try to cover up the White House&#x27;s link to Mattiece, afraid that it might endanger the president&#x27;s re-election. The president orders FBI Director F. Denton Voyles to temporarily stop working on the brief, and asks the more trusted CIA Director Bob Gminski to conduct the investigation instead. They also send an agent to Mattiece to find out whether the brief is true, but Mattiece, who has become practically insane over the past several years, has the agent killed.

Shaw and Grantham manage to track down Curtis Morgan, a.k.a. &quot;Garcia&quot;, an employee of the law firm representing Mattiece, only to find out that he died some days before in an apparent mugging. They manage to contact his widow, leading them to discover Morgan&#x27;s written and videotaped testimony. Morgan reveals that, some time before the assassinations, he accidentally looked at an internal correspondence and realized that some of his co-workers were involved in the murders. Afraid that he himself might be killed, Morgan decided to record his testimony. With this evidence, Grantham and Shaw approach the &quot;Post&quot;″s chief editor. Voyles appears at the newsroom and reveals that he has a tape recording of the conversation with the President ordering him to stop working on the brief, and that the CIA was investigating Mattiece and killed Khamel to save Shaw&#x27;s life. He also arranges a plane for Shaw to disappear.

The story prominently appears in the &quot;Post&quot;, over the objections of the president and his staff. One of the implicated lawyers commits suicide. The President is expected to announce he will not seek re-election. Mattiece disappears. Shaw settles on an island in the Caribbean and is joined by Grantham, who agrees to stay for at least a month.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book a &quot;gripping legal suspenser,&quot; writing that it &quot;is a tale that baits its own hooks with the lures of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Grisham recycles the old formulas with sure pacing and considerable panache.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that the author &quot;delivers a suspenseful plot at a breakneck pace, although his characters are stereotypes.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Black Baronet&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes murder mystery written by Adrian Conan Doyle (the youngest son of Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) and John Dickson Carr. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 23 May 1953, illustrated by Robert Fawcett.

==Plot==

Holmes and Watson are relaxing in their vacation hotel in East Grinstead when Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard arrives to obtain assistance in a dreadful murder. Colonel Jocelyn Dalcy, a guest in the home of Sir Reginald Lavington, has been found stabbed to death. No weapon was found, but a dagger is missing from a nearby display. Sir Reginald claims he was using it while fishing and mislaid it. All suspicion falls upon him, and Gregson is about to make the arrest, but Holmes asks for a day to do some more research. An interview with the beautiful Lady Lavington provides the final clue.

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Adventure of the Black Baronet&quot; was adapted for a half-hour episode of the CBS series &quot;Suspense&quot;, broadcast on 26 May 1953. Martyn Green played Watson opposite Basil Rathbone. According to Rathbone, it was intended to be a pilot for a subsequent television series which would adapt six more Doyle/Carr stories. No recording of the program is known to have survived.

<text>A galactoside is a glycoside containing galactose. The H of the OH group on carbon-1 of galactose is replaced by an organic moiety.

Depending on whether the glycosidic bond lies &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the plane of the galactose molecule, galactosides are classified as α-galactosides or β-galactosides.

A β-galactoside is a type of galactoside in which the glycosidic bond lies above the plane of the galactose residue. The most commonly recognized and used β-galactoside in biochemistry is lactose. However, other chemicals, such as ONPG, are known, but these are typically synthesized for biochemical assays.

Galactosides play significant roles in metabolic processes of many organisms and are hydrolyzed by a class of enzymes called galactosidases and are classified according to what type of glycosidic linkage on the galactoside they will break. For example, enzymes that hydrolyze the β-galactoside glycosidic bond are called β-galactosidases, while those that hydrolyze the α-galactoside glycosidic bond are known as α-galactosidases.

<doc id="543152" wikidata="Q904988" url="?curid=543152" title="De Havilland Gipsy Major">
<text>The de Havilland Gipsy Major or Gipsy IIIA is a four-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted inline engine used in a variety of light aircraft produced in the 1930s, including the famous Tiger Moth biplane. Many Gipsy Major engines still power vintage aircraft types.

Engines were produced by de Havilland in the UK and by the Australian arm of the company, de Havilland Australia, the latter modifying the design to use imperial measures rather than the original metric measurements.

==Design and development==
The engine was a slightly modified Gipsy III, which was effectively a de Havilland Gipsy engine modified to run inverted so that the cylinders pointed downwards below the crankcase. The Major was also bored-out (118 mm from 114 mm) compared to the Gipsy III, increasing displacement from 5 L to 6.1 L.

The inverted configuration allowed the propeller shaft to be kept in a high position without having the cylinders blocking the pilot&#x27;s forward view over the nose of the aircraft.

One initial disadvantage of the inverted configuration was the high oil consumption (up to four pints per hour) requiring regular refills of the external oil tank; this problem improved over time with the use of modified piston rings. First built in 1932, total production of all Gipsy Major versions was 14,615 units.

===Further development===
In 1934, when Geoffrey de Havilland needed a more powerful engine for his twin-engined transport aircraft, the four-cylinder Gipsy Major was further developed into the 200 hp six-cylinder Gipsy Six. In 1937 even more power was needed for the new D.H.91 Albatross four-engined transatlantic mailplane, and so two Gipsy Six cylinder banks were combined to form one Gipsy Twelve 12-cylinder inverted Vee. In military service, the Gipsy Twelve became known as the Gipsy King and the Gipsy Six the Gipsy Queen.

The advent of World War II cut short all civilian flying and after the war de Havilland was too busy concentrating on jet engines to put much energy into its piston engines. The Gipsy did not go without a fight though. In Canada the Gipsy Major was the engine of choice for the DHC1 Chipmunk trainer, which replaced the Tiger Moth trainer in RAF service after the war. By then however, the Gipsy Major was eclipsed by the Blackburn Cirrus Major in Britain and the American Lycoming and Continental horizontally opposed engines abroad. (In a twist of irony, the Blackburn itself was based on Frank Halford’s old ADC Cirrus engine; Blackburn had bought the licence in 1934).

In its final supercharged form, the Gipsy Major used in helicopter applications delivered 220 hp (164 kW).

By 1945 the Gipsy Major had been cleared for a world record 1,500 hours time between overhaul (TBO), surpassing its previously held world record of 1,260 hours TBO achieved in 1943. 1,000 hours TBO had earlier been achieved in 1938.

<doc id="543157" wikidata="Q2959189" url="?curid=543157" title="Charles Gavan Power">
<text>Charles Gavan &quot;Chubby&quot; Power (18 January 1888 – 30 May 1968) was a Canadian politician and ice hockey player. Many members of his family, including his father, two brothers, a son and a grandson, all had political careers; two of his brothers also played ice hockey.

==Early life==
Born in Sillery, Power played ice hockey while studying law. From 1906, he played for the Quebec Bulldogs of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). A proficient scorer, he scored four goals in one game in 1908 and five goals in a game in 1909.

==Military service==
Power served overseas in World War I, first as a private in the Westmount Battalion then to 3rd Battalion (Toronto Regiment), CEF as captain and then as an acting major with the 14th Battalion (Royal Montreal Regiment), CEF. He was wounded during the Battle of the Somme. He was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during military operations.

==Political career==
He entered politics in the 1917 federal election in which he was elected as a &quot;Laurier Liberal&quot; during the Conscription Crisis of 1917.

In 1935, Power was appointed minister of pensions and health in the Liberal cabinet of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. 
During World War II, he served as Acting Minister of National Defence (1940) and Minister of National Defence for Air (1940 to 1945) and was responsible for expanding the Royal Canadian Air Force. His opposition to conscription led him to resign from the cabinet during the Conscription Crisis of 1944, after the government passed an Order in Council to send conscripts overseas. Power sat as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; for the duration of the war and was re-elected as an Independent Liberal in the 1945 federal election. He then rejoined the party and ran to succeed King in the 1948 Liberal leadership convention but came a poor third.

Charles Power retired from the House of Commons in 1955. He was appointed to the Senate on 28 July 1955 and served until his death in 1968.

==Family==
His father, William Power, was also a Member of Parliament from Quebec, retiring in 1917. His brother James was also an ice hockey player. Another brother, Joe, was also an ice hockey player, as well as a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. Still another brother, William, became a Liberal member of the Legislative Council of Quebec. His son Frank Power also became a Liberal Member of Parliament, as did his grandson Lawrence Cannon, who also became a Conservative cabinet minister and later as Canadian Ambassador to France.

<text>Boys Don&#x27;t Cry is the Cure&#x27;s first compilation album. Released in February 1980, this album is composed of several tracks from the band&#x27;s May 1979 debut album &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; (which had yet to see a US release) with material from the band&#x27;s 1978–1979 era.

Behind the scenes of these albums, Bill Smith was the mastermind behind the concepts for both covers, while Chris Parry assumed the role of producer for both projects. Additionally, Tim Pope played a crucial role in directing the music videos for &quot;Killing An Arab&quot; and &quot;Jumping Someone Else’s Train,&quot; which were later featured in the 1986 video compilation. These behind-the-scenes efforts contributed significantly to the albums&#x27; artistic vision.

== Release ==
&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was released on 5 February 1980 by record label Fiction. According to AllMusic, the album &quot;[falls] somewhere between [an] official release and compilation&quot;, and was released &quot;in hopes of increasing the band&#x27;s exposure outside of the U.K.&quot;

A new version of the title track was released in April 1986.

In the majority of CD releases of the album, &quot;Object&quot; was swapped for &quot;So What&quot;, while the final scream in &quot;Subway Song&quot; was trimmed and &quot;World War&quot; was left out altogether.

== Reception ==
&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; has been generally well received by critics. Debra Rae Cohen of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album &quot;proves they can transcend their Comp. Lit. 201 (Elementary Angst) scenarios.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the band&#x27;s sound &quot;dry post-punk, never pretty but treated with a properly mnemonic pop overlay&quot;, and was more reserved in his praise, adding, &quot;I can look over the titles and recall a phrase from all but a few of these 13 songs. Intelligent phrases they are, too, yet somehow I find it hard to get really excited about them.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was voted number 775 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked at number 442 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In a 2012 update of the list, it moved up to number 438.

== Track listing ==


On most CD versions of the album, &quot;Object&quot; was replaced by &quot;So What&quot;, the scream at the end of &quot;Subway Song&quot; was shortened and &quot;World War&quot; was removed.

<text>Clark&#x27;s anemonefish (Amphiprion clarkii), also known as the yellowtail clownfish, is a marine fish belonging to the family Pomacentridae, the clownfishes and damselfishes.

==Characteristics of anemonefish== 

Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone&#x27;s meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators, and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Within species there may be color variations, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons.

In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. They are not aggressive. When the egg production and spawning patterns of eight breeding pairs were observed in a coral reef off the coast of the Philippines, they preferred breeding in the colder months. A trend of a peak breeding season from November through May was seen; egg production increased up to the new moon and decreased after the full moon. This seasonality of spawning is comparable to other species of clownfish that live in temperate regions.

==Description==


Clark&#x27;s anemonefish is a small-sized fish which grows up to as a male and as a female. It is stocky, laterally compressed, and oval to rounded.

It is colorful, with vivid black, white, and yellow stripes, though the exact pattern shows considerable geographical variation. Usually it is black dorsally and orange-yellow ventrally, the black areas becoming wider with age. There are two vertical white bands, one behind the eye and one above the anus, and the caudal peduncle is white. The snout is orange or pinkish. The dorsal and caudal fins are orange-yellow, and the caudal fin is generally lighter in tone than the rest of the body, sometimes becoming whitish.

===Color variations===
Clark&#x27;s anemonefish shows the greatest color variations of any anemonefish, with variations based on location, sex, age and host anemone. Adults in Vanuatu and New Caledonia are orange-yellow with two vertical white bands. Sex related color differences may be present, such as the female having a white caudal fin and the male having a yellow caudal fin. Juveniles are orange-yellow with vertical white bands. Fish living with the host anemone &quot;Stichodactyla mertensii&quot;, Mertens&#x27; carpet sea anemone are frequently black except for the snout bars and tail.

===Similar species of &quot;Amphiprion&quot;===
The caudal fin is forked and the base lacks a white bar on &quot;A. latifasciatus&quot;. The caudal fin lacks the sharp demarcation between white and dark and the mid-body bar is narrower on &quot;A. allardi&quot; and &quot;A. akindynos&quot;. The caudal fin is dark on &quot;A. chrysogaster&quot;, &quot;A. fuscocaudatus&quot; and &quot;A. tricinctus&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Clark&#x27;s anemonefish is the most widely distributed anemonefish, being found in tropical waters from the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific.

===Host anemones===
Clark&#x27;s anemonefish is the least host specific anemonefish, living in association with all ten species of sea anemones that host anemonefish:
*&quot;Cryptodendrum adhaesivum&quot;
*&quot;Entacmaea quadricolor&quot; Bubble-tip anemone
*&quot;Heteractis aurora&quot; beaded sea anemone
*&quot;Heteractis crispa&quot; Sebae anemone
*&quot;Heteractis magnifica&quot; magnificent sea anemone
*&quot;Heteractis malu&quot; delicate sea anemone
*&quot;Macrodactyla doreensis&quot; long tentacle anemone
*&quot;Stichodactyla gigantea&quot; giant carpet anemone
*&quot;Stichodactyla haddoni&quot;
*&quot;Stichodactyla mertensii&quot; Mertens&#x27; carpet sea anemone

==Etymology==
The specific name and the common name both honour the Scottish engraver John Heaviside Clark (1771–1836) who provided illustrations for Bennett&#x27;s &quot;A Selection from the most remarkable and interesting Fishes found on the Coast of Ceylon, from drawings made in the Southern part of that Island&quot;.

<doc id="543162" wikidata="Q465646" url="?curid=543162" title="Boys Don't Cry (1999 film)">
<text>Boys Don&#x27;t Cry is a 1999 American biographical film directed by Kimberly Peirce, and co-written by Peirce and Andy Bienen. The film is a dramatization of the real-life story of Brandon Teena (played by Hilary Swank), an American trans man who attempts to find himself and love in Nebraska but falls victim to a brutal hate crime perpetrated by two male acquaintances. The film co-stars Chloë Sevigny as Brandon&#x27;s girlfriend, Lana Tisdel.

After reading about the case while in college, Peirce conducted extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses on the relationship between Brandon and Lana. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary &quot;The Brandon Teena Story&quot;. Many actresses sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Brandon&#x27;s. Most of the film&#x27;s characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.

Filming occurred during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had to occur in Texas. The film&#x27;s cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced by a variety of styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music. The film&#x27;s themes include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, especially transgender people, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.

The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 1999, before appearing at various other film festivals. Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the film received a limited release in the United States on October 22, 1999, and it performed well at the North American box office, gaining three times its production budget by May 2000. The film was acclaimed by critics, with many ranking it as one of the best films of the year; praise focused on the lead performances by Swank and Sevigny as well as the film&#x27;s depiction of its subject matter. However, some people who had been involved with Brandon in real life criticized the film for not portraying the events accurately.

&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was nominated for multiple awards; at the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000, Swank was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress and Sevigny was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The pair were also nominated at the 57th Golden Globe Awards, with Swank winning the Best Actress – Drama award. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, which dealt with controversial issues, was initially assigned an NC-17 rating but was later reclassified to an R rating. It was released on home video in September 2000.

In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Brandon Teena is a young trans man living in rural Nebraska. When Brandon is discovered to be transgender by a former girlfriend&#x27;s brother, he receives death threats. Soon after, he is involved in a bar fight and is evicted from his cousin&#x27;s trailer. Brandon moves to Falls City, Nebraska, where he befriends ex-convicts John Lotter and Tom Nissen, and their friends Candace and Lana Tisdel. Brandon becomes romantically involved with Lana, who is initially unaware both of his anatomy and his troubled past. The two make plans to move to Memphis, where Brandon will manage Lana&#x27;s karaoke singing career. Eventually, they kiss during a date night which ends with them having sex.

The police detain Brandon on charges that arose before his relocation; they place him in the women&#x27;s section of the Falls City jail. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he was placed in a women&#x27;s jail. Brandon attempts to lie to her, saying he was born intersex and will soon receive genital reconstruction surgery, but Lana stops him, declaring her love for him regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in jail, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon&#x27;s birth name, and she and her friends react to this news with shock and disgust. They enter Brandon&#x27;s room, search among Brandon&#x27;s things, and discover transgender pamphlets that confirm their suspicions. When Brandon and Lana return, Tom and John violently confront Brandon and take him into the bathroom, forcibly removing his pants and revealing his genitals. They try to make Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John&#x27;s car and drive to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him.

Afterward, they take Brandon to Tom&#x27;s house, where Brandon escapes through a bathroom window. Although his assailants threaten Brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police, Lana convinces him to do so. However, the police chief proves to be less concerned with the crime and interrogates Brandon about his sexual identity.

Later, John and Tom get drunk and drive to Candace&#x27;s house. Lana attempts to stop them, but they find Brandon, who has been hiding in a nearby shed. John shoots Brandon under the chin, killing him instantly. While Candace is crying out to them to spare her baby, Tom shoots her in the head and kills her as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon&#x27;s lifeless body. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon&#x27;s body and the baby toddles through the open door to the outside, crying. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon&#x27;s corpse. Her mother arrives and takes her away from the scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter to her from Brandon that she found on his body, is heard in a voiceover, saying that in Memphis &quot;I&#x27;ll be waiting for you, love always and forever&quot;.

===Background===

Brandon Teena was a trans man who was gang raped and murdered by a group of male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, at the time a Columbia University film student, became interested in the case after reading a 1994 &quot;Village Voice&quot; article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon&#x27;s life and death; she said, &quot;the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, the fact that he did it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me.&quot; The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon&#x27;s life as part of what eventually caused his death. She admired Brandon&#x27;s audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.

Peirce wanted to tell the story from Brandon&#x27;s perspective. She was familiar with Brandon&#x27;s desire to wear men&#x27;s clothing: &quot;I started looking at all the other coverage and a great deal of it was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person.&quot; Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public was generally misinformed: she said, &quot;People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that&#x27;s really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in&quot;. Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;.

The project drew interest from various production companies. Diane Keaton&#x27;s production company, Blue Relief, showed interest in the screenplay in the mid-1990s. Initially, the film was to be largely based on Aphrodite Jones&#x27; 1996 true crime book &quot;All She Wanted&quot;, which told the story of Brandon&#x27;s final few weeks. Earlier drafts of the script incorporated scenes featuring Brandon&#x27;s family background, including his sister Tammy and mother Joann, as well as some of Teena&#x27;s ex-girlfriends. However, Peirce modified the script to fit her vision to focus on the relationship between Brandon and his 19-year-old girlfriend Lana Tisdel, which Peirce termed a &quot;great love story&quot;, in contrast to &quot;All She Wanted&quot;, which did not place an emphasis on the relationship.

To fund the writing and development of the project, Peirce worked as a paralegal on a midnight shift and as a 35mm film projectionist; she also received a grant from the New York Foundation for the Arts. The project attracted the attention of producer Christine Vachon, who had seen a short film Peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 about the case. IFC Films, Hart Sharp Entertainment, and Killer Films, Vachon and Eva Kolodner&#x27;s production company, provided financing for the project. IFC contributed roughly $1 million, but the film&#x27;s eventual budget remained under $2 million. Peirce co-wrote the screenplay with Andy Bienen. They worked together for 18 months on the final drafts and were careful not to &quot;mythologize&quot; Brandon; the aim was to keep him as human as possible. In the editing stage of the script, Peirce sent the draft to Fox Searchlight Pictures, which agreed to produce and distribute the film while giving Peirce artistic license.

Prior to filming, Peirce researched the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case. She immersed herself in the information available about the murder, including trial transcripts. She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel&#x27;s home. Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two weeks before he was murdered, was 19 years old at the time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel&#x27;s mother and Brandon&#x27;s acquaintances. However, she was unable to interview Brandon&#x27;s mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted arsonist, was incorporated into &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;.

===Casting===

The filmmakers retained the names of most of the case&#x27;s real-life protagonists, but the names of several supporting characters were altered. For example, the character of Candace was named Lisa Lambert in real life. The casting process for &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; lasted almost four years. Drew Barrymore was an early candidate to star in the film. Peirce scouted the LGBTQ community, looking mainly for masculine, lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena. Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder. High-profile actors avoided Peirce&#x27;s auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role.

At one point, the project was nearly abandoned because Peirce was not satisfied with most of the people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that, like Brandon, she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, &quot;But that&#x27;s what Brandon would do.&quot; Swank&#x27;s anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a &quot;known actor&quot; to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank&#x27;s audition was &quot;the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon.&quot;

Peirce required that Swank &quot;make a full transformation&quot; into a male. Immediately after being cast, Peirce took Swank to a hairdresser, where her lower-back length hair was cut and dyed chestnut brown. When she saw her then-husband, Chad Lowe, again, he barely recognized her. Swank prepared for the role by dressing and living as a man for at least a month, including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks down the front of her trousers as Brandon Teena had done. Her masquerade was convincing; Swank&#x27;s neighbors believed the &quot;young man&quot; coming and going from her home was Swank&#x27;s visiting brother. She reduced her body fat to seven percent to accentuate her facial structure and refused to let the cast and crew see her out of costume. Swank earned $75 per day for her work on &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, totaling $3,000. Her earnings were so low that she did not qualify for health insurance.
For the role of Brandon&#x27;s girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce had envisioned a teenage Jodie Foster. The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley. Peirce ultimately decided to cast Chloë Sevigny based on her performance in &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998). Sevigny had auditioned for the role of Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because she could not picture Sevigny as a man.
Sevigny dyed her hair red for the role to match Lana&#x27;s strawberry blonde hair. Peirce later said, &quot;Chloë just surrendered to the part. She watched videos of Lana. She just became her very naturally.&quot;

Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana&#x27;s former boyfriend, who raped and murdered Teena. Sarsgaard was one of the first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his character to be &quot;likable, sympathetic even&quot;, because he wanted the audience &quot;to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn&#x27;t necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren&#x27;t going to have a dull time if you were with him.&quot; In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt &quot;empowered&quot; by playing Lotter. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Sarsgaard said, &quot;I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y&#x27;know, and that everyone loved me.&quot; Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.

===Principal photography===

Initially, &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was scheduled to film for thirty days. However, principal photography for the film lasted from October 19 to November 24, 1998. The small budget dictated some of the filming decisions, including the omission of some incidents to speed up the overall pacing. Timing constraints and Peirce&#x27;s visions relating to the plot limited what could be achieved with the narrative. For example, the film portrays a double murder when in actuality a third person, Phillip DeVine—a black disabled man—was also killed at the scene. At the time, he had been dating Lana Tisdel&#x27;s sister, Leslie, who was omitted from the story. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was primarily filmed in Greenville, Texas, a small town about northeast of Dallas. Most of the incidents in the case took place in Falls City, Nebraska, but budget constraints led the filmmakers to choose locations in Texas.

Peirce initially wanted to shoot in Falls City, but Vachon told her that filming there would not be possible. Afterwards, the film was going to be shot in Omaha, Nebraska, but Peirce felt that &quot;none of [the places] looked right.&quot; In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas. One of Peirce&#x27;s main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film&#x27;s DVD commentary track, Peirce said, &quot;The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon&#x27;s own mind and would not think he was crazy, would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human.&quot;

Some scenes in &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; required emotional and physical intensity; these were allocated extended periods of filming. The scene in which Brandon, at the wishes of his friends, bumper-skis on the back of a pickup truck, was delayed when a police officer, just arriving at a shift change, required a large lighting crane to be moved from one side of the road to the other. The scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise, resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background. There were some technical complications: some of the filming equipment got stuck in the mud, and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production. Swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck. Teena&#x27;s rape scene was given an extended filming time; Sexton, who portrayed one of the attackers, walked away in tears afterward. Swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to &quot;keep a distance&quot; from the reality of the actual event. When scenes became difficult, Swank requested the company of her husband on set. At times, Peirce worked for seventeen hours a day to complete more work, but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours.

===Cinematography===

Peirce, who had originally sought a career in photography before moving into filmmaking, applied techniques she had learned to the film. She described the film&#x27;s mood as an &quot;artificial night&quot;. Director of Photography Jim Denault showed her the work of photographer Jan Staller, whose long-exposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired Denault to avoid using &quot;moonlight&quot; effects for most of the film. As a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night, John Pirozzi, who had been experimenting with time-lapse photography using a non-motion-controlled moving camera, was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film.

The film&#x27;s visual style depicts the Midwestern United States in a &quot;withdrawn&quot;, dark and understated light to give a &quot;surreal&quot; effect. Denault shot &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; in flat, spherical format on 35mm film using Kodak Vision film stock. The film was shot with a Moviecam Compact camera fitted with Carl Zeiss super speed lenses. For the scene in which Brandon is stripped, a hand-held camera was used to give a sense of subjectivity and intimacy.

The use of low natural light and heavy artificial light is illustrated early in the film in the opening roller rink scene in which Brandon pursues his first relationship with a young woman. For this scene, Peirce used a three-shot method similar to that used in a scene in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) in which Dorothy leaves her house and enters Oz. The scene consists of a three-shot sequence meant to symbolize Brandon&#x27;s metaphorical &quot;entrance to manhood&quot;, or Brandon&#x27;s social transition from a woman to a man. Some scenes were given a prolonged shooting sequence to induce a feeling of hallucination. An example is the sequence in which Brandon and Lana first have sex, followed by a shot of her, Brandon, Candace, and Kate driving in a car against a city skyline backdrop. The scene in which John and Tom strip Brandon was filmed with three cameras due to time constraints, even though Peirce wanted six cameras to film it. The scene took an hour and a half to film in total.

Peirce drew inspiration from the filming style of John Cassavetes and the early work of Martin Scorsese, and she incorporated neo-realist techniques into the film. She was also influenced by a second style of work—the &quot;magical&quot; films of Michael Powell and Kenji Mizoguchi. The former style is used when Brandon joins the social circle of John, Tom, Lana and her mother, while the latter is used when Brandon and Lana begin to depart from that life. The film was also influenced by &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). Peirce incorporated influences from &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980) by opening the film with a shot of Brandon traveling along a highway, as seen from the character&#x27;s imaginative or dream perspective, similar to the beginning of &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. When a character expresses a dream or hopeful assertion, Peirce cuts to an &quot;eerily lit&quot; dream landscape. &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964) inspired the cinematography and editing of Brandon&#x27;s rape scene, particularly in its use of fast cutting.

===Music===
Because the film is set in the rural Midwestern United States, the &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; soundtrack album features a compilation of country, blues and rock music. Nathan Larson and Nina Persson of The Cardigans composed an instrumental version of Restless Heart&#x27;s 1988 country-pop song &quot;The Bluest Eyes in Texas&quot;, a variation of which was used as the film&#x27;s love theme and score. The song itself is heard during a karaoke scene, sung by Sevigny&#x27;s character, and at the end of the film. The title of the film is taken from the song of the same name by British rock band The Cure. An American cover of the song, sung by Nathan Larson, plays in the background in the scene in which Lana bails Brandon out of jail and during one of their sex scenes. However, the song is not included in the released soundtrack. Songs by Lynyrd Skynyrd (&quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Gone&quot;), Paisley Underground band Opal (&quot;She&#x27;s a Diamond&quot;) and The Charlatans (&quot;Codine Blues&quot;) also appear in the film, as do cover versions of other songs. The soundtrack was released on November 23, 1999, by Koch Records. &quot;The Bluest Eyes in Texas&quot; was played when Hilary Swank went onstage to receive her Academy Award for Best Actress in 2000. The song also plays over the film&#x27;s end credits.

==Themes and analysis==

&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; has been widely discussed and analyzed by scholars and others. Roger Ebert described the film as a &quot;romantic tragedy&quot; embedded in a working class American setting, calling it &quot;&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; set in a Nebraska trailer park&quot;. Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued that the question of identity—particularly Brandon&#x27;s—is alluded to frequently in &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and that Peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the film&#x27;s main question. Journalist Janet Maslin said the film is about accepting identity, which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity. Paula Nechak called the film a &quot;bold cautionary tale&quot;; she regarded the film as a negative, dismal depiction of Midwestern America, writing that &quot;[Peirce&#x27;s film has] captured the mystique and eerie loneliness&quot; and &quot;isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to violence and despair&quot;.

Christine Vachon, the film&#x27;s executive producer, said, &quot;It&#x27;s not just about two stupid thugs who killed somebody. It&#x27;s about these guys whose world is so tenuous and so fragile that they can&#x27;t stand to have any of their beliefs shattered&quot;, referring to John and Tom&#x27;s views of their lives, Brandon&#x27;s aspirations and his biological sex. Along with other turn-of-the-millennium films such as &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; (1997), &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), and &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000), Vincent Hausmann said &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; &quot;raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis&quot;. Jason Wood said the film, together with Patty Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Monster&quot; (2003), is an exploration of &quot;social problems&quot;.

===Romantic and platonic relationships===

Several scholars commented on the relationship between Brandon and Lana as well as Brandon&#x27;s relationship with John and Tom. Carol Siegel regarded the film as a thematically rich love story between two ill-fated lovers, similar to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Jack Halberstam attributed &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;&#x27;s success to its ostensible argument for tolerance of sexual diversity by depicting a relationship between two unlikely people.

This tragic aspect of the love story led Halberstam to compare Brandon and Lana&#x27;s relationship and subsequent drama to classic and modern romances including &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, often using the term star-crossed lovers. In the &quot;Journal for Creativity in Mental Health&quot;, Jinnelle Veronique Aguilar discussed Brandon&#x27;s ability to create interpersonal relationships in the film. She opined that Brandon wanted to create close relationships, but he could not due to his transgender status until he became close with Lana. &quot;Although Brandon can make a brief but authentic connection with Lana, he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world. He consistently faces a sense of fear related to the power-over dynamics that he and others who are transsexual face…Brandon experiences the central relational paradox, in which he yearns for connection; however, due to the real threat he faces, he is unable to make that connection.&quot;

Myra Hird, in the &quot;International Feminist Journal of Politics&quot;, argued that John and Brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity, and that Brandon&#x27;s version is preferred by the film&#x27;s female characters, comparing them to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jimmy Stewart, respectively. &quot;Throughout the film, John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity. […] Against this hegemonic masculinity, Brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a by-gone era of chivalry.&quot; Furthermore, she contended that John was threatened by Brandon&#x27;s version of masculinity. &quot;Gender boundaries are taken extremely seriously in Western society, and &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; depicts how intensely threatened John and Tom are by Brandon&#x27;s superior portrayal of a masculinity &#x27;schedule&#x27;. John cannot abide Brandon&#x27;s desire, and clear ability, to access male privilege, and his reaction is to force Brandon to &quot;be&quot; female through the act of rape.&quot;

===Causes of violence against LGBT people===

Other commentators discussed the more complex psychological causes of Brandon&#x27;s murder. Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder, and whether it was due to transphobia or homophobia: &quot;Ultimately in &quot;Boys&quot; [&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;], the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism, the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage.&quot; Ebert called the film a &quot;sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame&quot;.

In the same journal, Julianne Pidduck commented on the film&#x27;s rape and murder scenes, &quot;Effectively, the viewer is asked to experience the rape from the victim&#x27;s point of view. The film invites political, emotional and corporeal allegiances linked to known and imagined risk, especially for female and/or queer viewers. An allegiance with Brandon&#x27;s outsider status aligns the viewer with Brandon&#x27;s initial exhilaration at his transgressive success as a boy, drawing us through to the film&#x27;s disturbing finale.&quot;

===Self and transgender identity===
Many scholars addressed the various performances of gender by the characters in the film; Moss and Lynne Zeavin offered a psychoanalytic analysis, calling the film a &quot;case report&quot; that &quot;presents [Brandon&#x27;s] transsexual inclinations as a series of euphoric conquests&quot; and &quot;focuses on a range of anxious reactions to her transsexuality. […] or a case not for what they might reveal about female hysteria, but for what they might reveal about misogyny&quot;. Elaborating on the themes of the film, they wrote:

In her film, Pierce [&quot;sic&quot;] inserts the unconventional problems of transsexuality into a conventional narrative structure. Throughout the film Brandon is presented as a doomed, though beguiling and beautiful rascal, recognizably located in the lineage of well-known cinematic bad-boys like James Dean, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman. Like these predecessors, Brandon&#x27;s heroic stature derives from her [&quot;sic&quot;] unwillingness to compromise her [&quot;sic&quot;] identity … Pierce [&quot;sic&quot;] presents Brandon&#x27;s struggles against biological determinism as the struggles of a dignified renegade.
Brenda Cooper, in &quot;Critical Studies in Media Communication&quot;, argued that the film &quot;can be read as a liberatory narrative that queers the centers of heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity by privileging female masculinity and celebrating its differences from heterosexual norms.&quot; She argued that the film challenged heteronormativity by criticizing the concept of the American Heartland, by presenting problems with heterosexual masculinity and its internalised aggression, by &quot;centering female masculinity&quot;, and blurring gender boundaries.

Later on in the same essay, she commented that Brandon both embodied and rejected traditional masculinity, providing a new outlook on what it means to be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film: &quot;Brandon’s performance of masculinity, however, can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives: When Brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies, he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that John and Tom represent. But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity, which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what it takes to be a man and to please a woman. Brandon’s articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity.&quot; Michele Aaron, in &quot;Screen&quot;, claimed that the film was primarily centered on &quot;the spectacle of transvestism&quot; and that the film as a whole was &quot;a tale of passing&quot;.

Jennifer Esposito wrote that &quot;We watch onscreen as Brandon binds his breasts, packs a dildo, fixes his hair in a mirror. His masculinity is carefully scripted. John and Tom…are never shown preparing for masculinity. They are already masculine.&quot; Melissa Rigney argued that the film defied traditional portrayals of transgender characters by not confining Brandon to certain stereotypes. &quot;On the surface, &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; appears to hold the potential of rendering gender in excess: the figure of Brandon Teena can be read variously as butch, male, lesbian, transgender, transsexual, and heterosexual. […] Although female masculinity comes to the forefront in this film, I argue that the film attempts to subsume the transgressive potential of the gender outlaw within a lesbian framework and narrative, one that reduces and, ultimately, nullifies Brandon&#x27;s gender and sexual excess.&quot;

In contrast, Annabelle Wilcox opined that the film primarily reinforced the gender binary by showing that &quot;Brandon&#x27;s body is branded by such rhetoric and representation, and is assumed to be a site of &#x27;truth&#x27; that closes the question that being transgender poses for subjectivity, gender, and sexuality.&quot; She also went on to note that many film critics either disregarded Brandon&#x27;s male identity or used female pronouns when referring to him. Rachel Swan, writing for &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, wrote that Brandon&#x27;s masculinity was often contrasted with Lana&#x27;s femininity as a means of illustrating the two sides of the gender binary. In addition, she regarded John and Tom&#x27;s rape of Brandon as an attempt to psychologically castrate him.

In another piece, Halberstam compared the media portrayal of Brandon to that of Billy Tipton, a jazz musician who no one knew was transgender until the post-mortem discovery that he was assigned female at birth. She wrote, &quot;On some level Brandon&#x27;s story, while cleaving to its own specificity, needs to remain an open narrative—not a stable narrative of FTM transsexual identity nor a singular tale of queer bashing, not a cautionary fable about the violence of rural America nor an advertisement for urban organizations of queer community; like the narrative of Billy Tipton, Brandon&#x27;s story permits a dream of transformation.&quot; Christine Dando argued that &quot;masculinity is associated with outside and femininity with interior spaces.&quot;

===Social class and race===
Lisa Henderson commented on the intersection between social class and gender in the film, particularly Brandon&#x27;s working-class status: &quot;My reading of &quot;Boys&quot; [&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;] through the lens of class representation is not born of a univocal search for so-called positive images, but I do recoil at what appears to me to be a new instalment in a long history of popular images of working-class pathology. […] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life.&quot;

Jennifer Devere Brody commented on the film&#x27;s exclusion of Philip DeVine, a disabled African-American man who was another victim of the shooting. &quot;Perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision. But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations. The erasure of DeVine from the narrative places the white female bodies as the only true victims of crime; and the film&#x27;s inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of the black man as always already a perpetrator of crime.&quot; Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, &quot;Peirce perhaps thought that her film, already running close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine&#x27;s story from &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion.&quot;

===Culture of the Midwestern United States===

Several authors commented on the possible impact that the film&#x27;s setting of Falls City, Nebraska, located in the Midwestern United States, could have had on the film&#x27;s plot. Maslin called &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; a tale of a trapped, small town character&#x27;s search for life beyond the rural existence and the high price he pays for his view of the American Dream. Regarding the film&#x27;s portrayal of Nebraska, Halberstam wrote, &quot;The landscape of Nebraska then serves as a contested site upon which multiple narratives unfold, narratives indeed which refuse to collapse into simply one story. Some of these narratives are narratives of hate, some of desire; others tell of ignorance and brutality; still others of isolation and fear; some allow violence and ignorant prejudices to become the essence of white poor rural identity; still others provoke questions about the deployment of whiteness and the regulation of violence.&quot;

Christina Dando wrote that the typical portrayal of the Midwest as a &quot;frontier&quot; area did not come through in the film until the setting switched from Lincoln to Falls City: &quot;The flat landscape, the spacious sky, the home, evoke two different Plains time periods familiar to many Americans through historic photographs: the early settlement process…and 1930s Farm Security Administration photographs. It is virtually timeless. There is also a sense of both place and placelessness. While the landscape is distinctively Plains, it could be described as nowhere.&quot;

She went on to argue that the setting is not only conveyed visually, but also through the characters&#x27; homes. &quot;While there is no trailer park in Falls City, Brandon&#x27;s community there occupies the margin: Candace and Lana&#x27;s homes appear to be on the outskirts of town, or even outside of town. There are no complete families, only the family that that has been created. The men appear to have no homes, relationally or physically: none are shown to have a family. Speaking about the film&#x27;s cinematography and the relation to its themes:
Dando compared the film to other tragic books and films that have been set on the Great Plains, including &quot;My Ántonia&quot;, &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot;, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, and &quot;Badlands&quot;, writing that unlike the other works, &quot;Brandon is [a] character who truly crosses frontiers.&quot;

==Release and reception==

===Premiere and commercial performance===
&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; aired in Canada at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 1999. It premiered in the U.S. at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 1999, to critical acclaim. It was shown at the Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October, where it won further praise and appeared at the Venice International Film Festival. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was given a special screening in snippets at the Sundance Film Festival. At that time, the film was still called &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;. The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22, 1999, in the U.S., where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox that specializes in independent films. Initially, many viewers complained via email to Peirce that the film was not being shown near them, as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country. However, this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000. The film grossed $73,720 in its opening week. By December 5, the film had grossed in excess of $2 million. By May 2000, it had a U.S. total gross of $11,540,607—more than three times its production budget. Internationally, the film was released on March 2, 2000, in Australia and on April 9, 2000, in the United Kingdom.

===Critical response===
Critics lauded &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; upon its release, with many calling it one of the best films of the year. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% of 85 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.90/10; the site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;Harrowing yet stirring, &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; powerfully commemorates the life -- and brutally unjust death -- of transgender teen Brandon Teena&quot;. Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film an 86 of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. One reviewer said the film was a &quot;critical knockout&quot;.

Critics often praised the performances by Swank and Sevigny; Peter Travers said the pair &quot;give performances that burn in the memory&quot;, and The Film Stage termed Swank&#x27;s performance &quot;one of the greatest&quot; Best Actress Oscar-winning performances. Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; lauded the lead acting performances of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, writing, &quot;It may be the best-acted film of the year&quot;. Online film reviewer James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film&#x27;s greatest success and likened the film&#x27;s intensity to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli wrote that Swank &quot;gives the performance of her career&quot; and that &quot;Sevigny&#x27;s performance is more conventional than Swank&#x27;s, but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film.&quot; Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the acting &quot;flawless&quot; and concluded that the &quot;stunningly accomplished&quot; and &quot;candid&quot; film could be &quot;seen as a &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfits enacting a version of the James Dean—Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction, searching, like their &#x27;50s counterparts, for love, self-worth and a place to call home&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the performances are of such &quot;luminous humanity that they break your heart&quot;. &quot;Premiere&quot; listed Swank&#x27;s performance as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Swank a &quot;revelation&quot; and wrote, &quot;by the end, her Brandon/Teena is beyond male or female. It&#x27;s as if we were simply glimpsing the character&#x27;s soul, in all its yearning and conflicted beauty.&quot;

Other reviewers were positive towards the way &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; portrayed its subject matter. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; listed &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; as one of the five best films of 1999, saying, &quot;This could have been a clinical movie of the week, but instead it&#x27;s a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film was &quot;stunning&quot; and gave it four stars out of four stars. Maslin said, &quot;unlike most films about mind-numbing tragedy, this one manages to be full of hope&quot;. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters, and wrote, &quot;Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless, hopeless, stoned-out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; is an exceptional—and exceptionally disturbing film&quot;. Mike Clarke of &quot;USA Today&quot; commended Peirce&#x27;s depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter, writing, &quot;Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad-school-thesis intensity&quot;.

Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; not only revisits the crime, but convinces us we&#x27;re being taken inside it&quot;. Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; gave a positive review, singling out the directing and acting. She wrote, &quot;Peirce ... covers an extraordinary amount of territory, not just in terms of dealing with Brandon’s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him&quot;. Zacharek described Swank&#x27;s performance as &quot;a continual revelation&quot; and Sevigny&#x27;s performance as &quot;transformative&quot;. She said, &quot;When Brandon dies, &quot;Boys Don’t Cry&quot; reaches an emotional intensity that’s almost operatic. The saddest thing, though, is seeing Sevigny’s Lana crumpled over his corpse—the way she plays it, you know that when Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too&quot;. David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; was also very positive towards the film, calling it &quot;a meditation on the irrelevance of gender.&quot; He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she &quot;keeps the movie tantalizing&quot;.

The film was not without detractors, who focused on the film&#x27;s portrayal of Brandon and his actions. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine was one of the film&#x27;s negative reviewers; he wrote, &quot;the film lets down the material. It&#x27;s too cool: all attitude, no sizzle&quot;. Peter Rainer of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; compared the film unfavorably with &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1954), calling it a &quot;transgendered &quot; version, elaborating that the film &quot;could have used a tougher and more exploratory spirit; for Peirce, there was no cruelty, no derangement in Brandon&#x27;s impostures toward the unsuspecting,&quot; the review repeatedly misgendering Brandon and negatively focusing on him being transgender and the claim that he misled people despite his girlfriend in the film accepting him for who he was. In 2007, &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked the film on its list of &quot;The 25 Most Dangerous Movies&quot;.

The film was generally well-received by the LGBT community. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;″s release came a year after the murder of a homosexual teenager, Matthew Shepard, which occurred October 12, 1998. The murder sparked additional public interest in hate crime legislation in America and in Brandon Teena, and increased public interest in &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. Cooper wrote that &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; &quot;is perhaps the only film addressing the issue of female masculinity by a self-described queer filmmaker to reach mainstream audiences and to receive critical acclaim and prestigious awards.&quot; However, Noelle Howey, writing for &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, wrote that despite the critical acclaim, relatively few critics understood what she perceived as the main point of the film—Brandon being a victim of trans bashing. Howey said, &quot;Even a cursory glance at reviews of &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; reveals that while most critics admired the film, few absorbed its main point: that Brandon Teena was a biological girl who felt innately that she was a man. Most of the media instead cast Teena as a Yentl for the new millennium, rather than a victim of anti-transgender bigotry.&quot;

====Factual accuracy====
The accuracy of &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was disputed by real-life people involved in the murder. The real Lana Tisdel declared her dislike for the film; she said Brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered Brandon was transgender, she ended the relationship. Tisdel disliked the way she was portrayed in the film, and called the film the &quot;second murder of Brandon Teena&quot;. Before the film&#x27;s theatrical release, Lana Tisdel sued the film&#x27;s producers, claiming that the film depicted her as &quot;lazy, white trash and a skanky snake&quot; and that her family and friends had come to see her as &quot;a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder&quot;. Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum. Sarah Nissen, cousin of murderer Marvin Nissen, was also critical of the film, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s none of it that&#x27;s right. It was just weird.&quot; Leslie Tisdel, Lana&#x27;s sister, called the film &quot;a lie of a movie&quot;.

Lana Tisdel&#x27;s potential involvement in the rape and murder of Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon&#x27;s family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel&#x27;s motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present at the time of the murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert, and DeVine were staying.

===Awards and nominations===

The film won a variety of awards, most of which went to Swank for her performance. Swank won a Best Actress Oscar while Sevigny received a nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress. From the Hollywood Foreign Press, the film received two Golden Globe nominations in the same two categories (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress) for Swank and Sevigny, winning Best Actress. Swank and Sevigny both received Best Actress Awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and an Independent Spirit Award. The film won three awards at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards: Best Actress (Swank), Best Supporting Actress (Sevigny) and Best Director (Peirce). Swank and Sevigny won Satellite Awards for their performances, and the film was nominated in two categories; Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director. It was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.

The family of Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her repeated use of the male gender pronoun &quot;he&quot; in her Oscar acceptance speech. Teena&#x27;s mother JoAnn Brandon said her child&#x27;s transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse, rather than being an expression of Teena&#x27;s gendered sense of self. JoAnn said, &quot;She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her&quot;. Despite the criticism, Kevin O&#x27;Keeffe, writing for &quot;Out&quot;, defended Swank&#x27;s acceptance speech; he said, &quot;Swank deserves a place in the great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner&quot;.

===Rating and home media===
&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; garnered significant attention for its graphic rape scene. The film was initially assigned an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA); the content was toned down for the U.S. release, where it was rated R. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;, which discussed the film&#x27;s problems with the MPAA, particularly the censoring of the sex scenes. The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA and had to be trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating. Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene. She also claimed that one objection from the MPAA was that one scene featured an orgasm that was &quot;too long&quot;, and rhetorically asked if anyone had ever been hurt by an orgasm that was too long. The film is rated 18 by the British Board of Film Classification.

&quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was first released on home video by Fox Searchlight Pictures in September 2000 as part of a &quot;Premiere Series&quot;, preceded by a DVD release in April 2000 in the United States and Canada. The DVD&#x27;s special features included a commentary by Kimberly Peirce and a behind-the-scenes featurette containing interviews with Peirce, Swank and Sevigny; there was also a theatrical trailer and three television trailers. This same edition was re-released in 2009 with different cover art. The film was released on Blu-ray on February 16, 2011, by 20th Century Fox Entertainment in conjunction with Fox Pathé Europa.

<doc id="543169" wikidata="Q8013404" url="?curid=543169" title="William Jackson Palmer">
<text>William Jackson Palmer (September 18, 1836 – March 13, 1909) was an American civil engineer and veteran of the American Civil War. During the Civil War, he was promoted to brevet brigadier general and received a Medal of Honor for his actions.

In his early career, Palmer helped develop the expanding railroads of the United States in Pennsylvania; this was interrupted by the American Civil War. He served in colorful fashion as a Union Army cavalry Colonel and was appointed to the brevet grade of Brigadier General. After the war, he contributed financially to educational efforts for the freed former slaves of the South.

Heading west in 1867, Palmer helped build the Kansas Pacific Railway. He befriended a young English doctor, Dr. William Abraham Bell, who became his partner in most of his business ventures. Generally Palmer took the role of president with Bell as vice president. The two men are best known as co-founders of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (Rio Grande). The Rio Grande and its successors eventually operated the largest network of narrow gauge railroad in the United States. They were ultimately absorbed by the 21st century Union Pacific Railroad.

Palmer and Bell are notable for helping introduce to the United States the practices of burning coal (rather than wood) for railroad engines and using narrow gauge railways. He helped develop rail-related industries in Colorado, such as a large steel mill near Pueblo. He founded the city of Colorado Springs, in 1871, as well as several other communities. Palmer founded Colorado Springs as a &quot;dry&quot; community, based on his Quaker and temperance beliefs. He funded institutions of higher education and helped found a hospital for tuberculosis, then incurable. Public schools in Colorado Springs were named for both him and his wife, Mary (née Mellen) Palmer, who was known by her nickname of &quot;Queen&quot;. A statue of William J. Palmer still stands in downtown Colorado Springs, across from the school named in his honor.

==Early life==
William Jackson Palmer was born in 1836 to a Hicksite sect Quaker family on their Kinsdale Farm in 1836, near Leipsic, Kent County, Delaware. His parents were John and Matilda (Jackson) Palmer. When he was five years old, his family moved to Germantown, then an independent city outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended the private Friends School, and then public schools: Zane Street School and Boys&#x27; Central High School.

==Pennsylvania railroads==
In 1851, Palmer went to work at the age of 15 in western Pennsylvania as a clerk for Hempfield Railroad&#x27;s engineering department. Two years later, at age 17, he worked under chief engineer Charles Ellet, Jr. as a rodman. Palmer became transitman for Hempfield in 1854.

Frank H. Jackson, president of Westmoreland Coal Company and Palmer&#x27;s maternal uncle, encouraged him to go to England to study coal mining and railroads, which he believed were going to be key to United States development. The young Palmer was particularly interested in whether railroad engines could run on anthracite coal rather than wood as fuel. He left in the summer of 1855 for a six-month period, having arranged to write paid articles for &quot;Miner&#x27;s Journal&quot; of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, to finance the trip abroad. He also borrowed money from his uncle. While in England, Palmer met with noted railroad engineers such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Robert Stephenson,—and visited railroads, mills, and coal mines.

In 1856, his uncle Jackson hired Palmer to work at Westmoreland Coal Company as the secretary and treasurer. The following year he worked at the Pennsylvania Railroad and became private secretary to President John Edgar Thomson, a successful Quaker businessman. At this time, future industrialist Andrew Carnegie was a peer and secretary to a company vice president. Palmer wrote, &quot;Reports of Experiments with Coal Burning Locomotives&quot; and learned about running a railroad from Thomson. Palmer began an evaluation of converting steam engines to run on coal, which was more abundant , rather than wood. His findings were key to changing the type of fuel used to fuel the country&#x27;s locomotives. He began a relationship with Thomas A. Scott at the Pennsylvania Railroad. Scott was later appointed as Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation during the Civil War.

==Civil War service==

As the American Civil War began in 1861, although his Quaker upbringing made Palmer abhor violence, his passionate abolitionism compelled him in keeping with the dictates of his conscience to enlist in the Pennsylvania volunteers. Palmer took a commission in the Union Army. He organized the Anderson Troop, an independent company of Pennsylvania cavalry, in the fall of 1861 and was elected its captain. Originally formed to act as a bodyguard for Brig. Gen. Robert Anderson, it instead served as the headquarters cavalry for General Don Carlos Buell, commanding the Army of the Ohio. Impressed with the &quot;elite scouts&quot; that Palmer had assembled, Buell detailed Palmer and 12 of his men to go back to Pennsylvania to recruit more men to form a battalion around the Anderson Troop that would be known as the &quot;1st Anderson Cavalry&quot;.

In ten days of recruiting, however, Palmer received enough applications for enlistment to form a regiment, which was authorized as the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry. He was appointed the regiment&#x27;s colonel. Before Palmer was able to organize the regiment at Camp Alabama in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, he and a portion of it were ordered on September 9 to help the Army of the Potomac resist the Confederates invasion of Maryland. For nearly a week Palmer, accompanied by a telegrapher, personally sought information of Lee&#x27;s movements every night in civilian clothing, and transmitted his findings to General George B. McClellan via telegraph connections.

Two days after the Battle of Antietam, Palmer was captured while scouting at the personal direction of McClellan, seeking information on any preparations by Lee&#x27;s army to cross the Potomac River back into Virginia. He was on the Confederate side of the river, again garbed in civilian clothes and accompanied by a local blacksmith and a parson as his guides, attempting to recross to the Union side after midnight when he was captured by Confederate artillerymen sent to guard the dam he used for the crossing. When questioned, Palmer gave his name as &quot;W.J. Peters,&quot; and claimed to be an engineer on an inspection trip. He was interrogated by General William N. Pendleton, who thought he was a spy. He was detained and sent to Richmond, Virginia, with a rambling note from Pendleton that was ignored.

Palmer was incarcerated at the notorious Castle Thunder prison on Tobacco Row, Richmond where his true identity was never uncovered. Doubts about his identity were apparently reinforced by publication of a fictitious dispatch in the Philadelphia newspapers that purported that Palmer was in Washington, D.C., after scouting in Virginia. When he was freed after four months of confinement, he found that his guide, the Reverend J.J. Stine, had escaped but been arrested by Union authorities, accused of betraying him to the enemy. Rather than risk Palmer&#x27;s life by publication of the circumstances in the Northern press, Stine had remained imprisoned in Fort Delaware until Palmer&#x27;s personal application to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton resulted in his release.

Palmer was set free in a prisoner exchange for a prominent Richmond citizen, recuperated two weeks, and rejoined his regiment in February 1863. During his period of imprisonment, the regiment had become mutinous because of a failure to have officers appointed and other enlistment inducements it felt had not been honored. 212 troopers faced court-martial and the possibility of going before a firing squad for refusing to fight in the Battle of Stone&#x27;s River. Palmer reorganized the regiment, personally appointed officers in whose abilities he had great trust, and had the charges against the confined soldiers dropped on the condition that they behaved going forward. The severely demoralized group of men rallied and distinguished themselves during the 1863 Tullahoma Campaign, the Battle of Chickamauga, the capture of Brig. Gen. Robert B. Vance&#x27;s raiding cavalry and re-capture of 28 wagons of a foraging train in January 1864, and the Franklin–Nashville Campaign.

At Chickamauga, Palmer&#x27;s regiment was detailed as headquarters guard for the Army of the Cumberland with many troopers doled out to the various corps as couriers and scouts. When Longstreet unexpectedly attacked the union right near Rosecrans&#x27; headquarters, Palmer gathered all the men of his regiment available and prepared to counterattack with a saber charge. The Union right flank dissolved, however, and after attempting to rally the panicked infantry, his regiment crossed the battlefield in good order under Confederate artillery fire to protect the Union artillery. During the army&#x27;s retreat to Chattanooga, the 15th Pennsylvania provided escort for the army&#x27;s supply train. Not easily impressed, Major General George H. Thomas (the &quot;Rock of Chickamauga&quot;) recommended that Palmer receive a brigadier&#x27;s star for his success at turning a highly demoralized group of men to an effective group of soldiers.

Palmer was vigorous in pursuing Confederate General John Bell Hood after the Battle of Nashville in 1864. On March 9, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Palmer for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers at the age of 28, with the U.S. Senate confirming the appointment on March 10, 1865. On March 16 he was promoted to command of the 1st Brigade of the Cavalry Division, District of East Tennessee, consisting of the 15th Pennsylvania, the 10th Michigan, and the 12th Ohio Cavalry Regiments. A month later he assumed command of the division after General Alvan C. Gillem was promoted to command of the District of East Tennessee. Palmer was in the vanguard of Union General George Stoneman&#x27;s 1865 Raid into Virginia and North Carolina in the last two months of the Civil War. At Martinsville, Virginia on April 8, 1865, Palmer&#x27;s cavalry defeated a Confederate force of Cavalry commanded by Colonel James Wheeler, the cousin of Confederate Cavalry commander Fighting Joe Wheeler. If Palmer had pushed on to Danville, only 20 miles to the north, he might very well have captured Jefferson Davis, who up till then had not left the capital of the Confederacy. Davis subsequently left the next day, upon receiving word of Lee&#x27;s surrender. This was a little-known campaign immortalized in The Band&#x27;s epic, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;.

Palmer commanded the cavalry pursuit of Jefferson Davis following the surrender by General Joseph E. Johnston. Davis was followed through North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia and driven into the hands of General James H. Wilson. During the pursuit, Palmer&#x27;s former command overtook and captured wagons carrying millions of dollars of specie, bonds, securities, notes, and other Confederate assets, near Covington, Georgia, that had been kept in the Bank of Macon (Georgia). Palmer was mustered out of the Union Army on June 21, 1865.

General George Henry Thomas wrote of Palmer:
On February 24, 1894, Palmer was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions as colonel leading the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry at Red Hill, Alabama, January 14, 1865, where &quot;with less than 200 men, [he] attacked and defeated a superior force of the enemy, captured their fieldpiece and about 100 prisoners without losing a man.&quot; Six former officers of the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry had nominated him the previous October to receive the honor, but for the scouting efforts in mufti during the Antietam Campaign that resulted in his capture. The War Department rejected that nomination on the basis that the acts, while valorous, had not been performed of a field of battle. They then submitted a new nomination for the action at Red Hill, which was approved.

==Western railroads==

===Kansas Pacific Railway===

After the War, Palmer resumed the railroad career he had started previous to the conflict. In 1867, a very optimistic, eager 30-year-old Palmer, and his 21-year-old chief assistant Edward Hibberd Johnson, headed west from their hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Palmer worked the Kansas Pacific Railway first as secretary and treasurer and then as managing director responsible for extending service through south central Colorado. With Kansas Pacific chief engineer Colonel William Henry Greenwood, Palmer organized a surveying expedition that recommended in 1868 that the route to the coast be diverted at Ellsworth, Kansas, to Pueblo, Colorado, and through the Royal Gorge to the San Luis Valley where it would turn south to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The route was rejected by the Kansas Pacific&#x27;s board of directors in favor of a line through Denver, which was completed in 1870.

===Denver and Rio Grande Railway===
While in the Colorado Territory, Palmer went to Colorado City (now Old Colorado City) to consider a north-south route from Denver for his own railway. Palmer had a vision to build a railroad south from Denver through New Mexico and El Paso to Mexico City. Palmer founded—with Greenwood, Colonel D.C. Dodge, former Colorado territorial Governor Alexander Cameron Hunt, Charles B. Lambord and others—and was elected president of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1870.

The first section of the railway included the first narrow gauge railroad tracks in the West. The line ran south of Denver and across the Palmer Divide, which separates the Platte River and Arkansas River watersheds, and to Colorado Springs by 1871. The line went to Pueblo in 1872, and further south to coal fields beyond Trinidad in April 1876. The railroad had service along the Arkansas River canyon to other coal mining locations, to the metal mining town of Leadville, and the iron mines in Saguache County, Colorado. Palmer stepped down as president in 1883 to focus greater attention on developing the Mexican line.

===Rio Grande Western Railway===
Palmer was president of the Rio Grande Western Railway from 1881 or 1883 to 1901. He built lines from the terminus of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway in Grand Junction to the Utah cities of Ogden and Salt Lake City. This provided direct service from Denver to Utah via narrow-gauge railway.

===Mexican National Railway===
In the spring of 1880, Palmer was made president of the Mexican National Railway (now National Railroad of Mexico). He hired Greenwood again as chief engineer in May, only to have Greenwood robbed and murdered on a survey near Mexico City on August 29. Most of the line was completed by 1883 when the railroad reached Mexico City.

==Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs==
Palmer came to the Colorado Territory as a surveyor with the Kansas Pacific Railway in search of possible railroad routes. Dr. William Abraham Bell from England was also part of the survey party. On July 31, 1871, Palmer and Bell founded Fountain Colony (later Colorado Springs), downstream of Colorado City, and it was laid out by the Colorado Springs Company that year. It was named for springs found along Monument Creek as early as 1871. Four chalybeate mineral springs were later discovered along Monument Creek in October 1880.

He also founded the town of Manitou (later Manitou Springs) as a resort town at the base of Pikes Peak. Palmer spent about $1,000,000 () on the construction of roads and development of parks in Manitou Springs, Old Colorado City, Colorado Springs, and Manitou Park.

In Colorado Springs, Palmer provided funding for Colorado College and within two years, Colorado Springs the town had 1,500 residents, schools, churches, banks, and a newspaper. Palmer donated land to establish the first city park, Acacia, and additional parks: Antlers Park, Monument Valley Park, North Cheyenne Cañon Park, Palmer Park, Pioneer Square Park (South Park), Prospect Lake and Bear Creek Cañon Park. He donated a total of 1,270 acres of land, some of which was also used for scenic drives, tree-lined roadways and foot and bridle paths. Palmer also provided the land and funding for the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind, a tuberculosis sanatorium, and multiple libraries. With the land that he gave for parks, churches, libraries, hospitals, and schools, he donated a total of 1,638 acres. Palmer also founded the &quot;Colorado Springs Gazette&quot; newspaper.

In 1883, he built the Antlers Hotel. When it burned down in 1898, he rebuilt the hotel with Italian Renaissance architecture. In 1901 Palmer honored Zebulon Montgomery Pike with a marble statue placed near the main entrance of the hotel. In 1904, Palmer located a mineral spring that had been used by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad company in 1871, but was covered in sands by flooding along Monument Creek; he next directed engineers to install a concrete vault to maintain the spring water&#x27;s purity and a hand pump to bring water to the surface. Palmer announced his intention to build a pavilion and to name the spring after Zebulon Pike’s Indian guide, Chief Tahama, also known as &quot;Rising Moose.&quot;

Other towns were founded by Palmer along his railroad lines, include Salida, Alamosa, and Durango.

==Colorado Coal and Iron Company==
Palmer envisioned &quot;an integrated industrial complex based on steel manufacturing&quot; in which all necessary resources were controlled by one company. In 1880, Palmer constructed Colorado Coal and Iron Company&#x27;s (CC&amp;I) steel mill south of Pueblo and laid out the town of Bessemer (now incorporated in Pueblo). The Minnequa plant became one of the greatest iron and steel plants in the country. His dream became a reality for his successors when, in 1892, CC&amp;I merged with the Colorado Fuel Company to form Colorado Fuel and Iron.

==Personal life==
Over the course of his life, Palmer was a member of the Denver Club, Colorado Springs Country Club, El Paso Country Club, City Midday Club (New York), and the Metropolitan Club (New York).

===Marriage===
Palmer met Mary Lincoln (Queen) Mellen in April 1869 while she and her father, William Proctor Mellen, were on a train returning from a trip to see the West. They were married November 7, 1870, in Flushing, New York, where the Mellen family lived at the time. They spent their honeymoon in Europe. They had three daughters, Elsie, Dorothy, and Marjory.

Palmer built a house that would eventually become Glen Eyrie Castle, Scottish for &quot;Valley of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest,&quot; in 1871 near Colorado Springs, as a home for his wife and family. While they lived there, Queen taught at Colorado Springs&#x27; first school.

Palmer had apartments in London and New York, a castle near Mexico City, and property throughout Colorado. The Palmers traveled frequently with their children and governesses to New York and London for William&#x27;s business and lived part-time at Glen Eyrie in Colorado.

Queen was of frail health, possibly aggravated by living at high altitude. While pregnant with their middle daughter Dorothy in 1880, Queen suffered a heart attack in Leadville during a vacation. Dorothy was born a few weeks later at Glen Eyrie. Then, their third daughter, Marjorie, was born in England. Two maids and a doctor had accompanied them on the trip. Over the next four years, Queen often lived on the East Coast or England, with visits by Palmer. In 1885, she left Glen Eyrie permanently, due to ongoing health concerns, and needing to live at a lower altitude, she returned to her home in England. In about 1887, Queen began renting Ightham Mote in Kent, where she lived for 3 years. William and Queen vacationed in France and Italy in the spring of 1889. Following other heart attacks which prevented any return to Colorado, Queen died in England on December 27, 1894, at the age of 44.

===Retirement===

When Palmer retired from business, he devoted himself to philanthropic endeavors, giving away $4 million (). In the autumn of 1906, Palmer suffered a fall from a horse and was partially paralyzed. Left with a broken spine, Palmer was thereafter confined to a wheelchair. Palmer sustained a C6 incomplete spinal cord injury, which would have paralyzed him from the neck down, making him a quadrapalegic.

Unable to travel, Palmer hosted the veterans of his 15th Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment troopers for their annual reunion in August 1907 at Glen Eyrie. He provided a special train and paid the travel expenses for 208 of about 260 surviving veterans. Mrs. J.A. Hayes, the wife of a prominent Colorado Springs banker and daughter of Jefferson Davis, was an honored guest at the reunion.

William Jackson Palmer died on March 13, 1909, at the age of 72. On the day of his death schools, businesses, and trains stopped and flags flew at half mast in Colorado Springs. The mayor said Palmer was &quot;the soldier, the builder of an empire, the philanthropist, the friend of the people, whose life was a blessing.&quot; &quot;Gazette&quot; journalist Dave Philipps said that he was &quot;an ardent pacifist, humanitarian and champion of preserving wildlands at a time when conservation was almost unheard of.&quot; His and Queen&#x27;s ashes are buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

==Legacy==
* Palmer made significant donations to the Hampton University in Virginia, a university built after the end of the Civil War for African-Americans, and Palmer Hall was named in his honor.
* Palmer was the land-grantor of several institutions in Colorado Springs, including the (International Typographical Union&#x27;s) Union Printer&#x27;s Home, the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind, several churches in central Colorado Springs, and Cragmor Sanatorium, a tuberculosis sanitarium which later was re-founded in 1965 as the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS).

<text>The Phoenix Islands, or Rawaki, are a group of eight atolls and two submerged coral reefs that lie east of the Gilbert Islands and west of the Line Islands in the central Pacific Ocean, north of Samoa. They are part of the Republic of Kiribati. Their combined land area is . The only island of any commercial importance is Canton Island (also called Abariringa). The other islands are Enderbury, Rawaki (formerly Phoenix), Manra (formerly Sydney), Birnie, McKean, Nikumaroro (formerly Gardner), and Orona (formerly Hull).

The Phoenix Islands Protected Area, established in 2008, is one of the world&#x27;s largest protected areas and is home to about 120 species of coral and more than 500 species of fish. The Phoenix Islands are uninhabited, except for a few families who live on Canton Island.

Historically, the Phoenix Islands have been considered part of the Gilberts Island group (sometimes known as the &quot;Kingsmill&quot; island group).

Geographically, Baker Island and Howland Island, two unincorporated territories of the United States that lie to the north of the Phoenix Islands, could be considered part of the same island group as the Phoenix Islands. However, politically and for statistical compilation purposes, Howland and Baker are considered part of the group known as the United States Minor Outlying Islands.

The United States once laid claim to all the Phoenix Islands under the 1856 Guano Islands Act. However, when Kiribati became an independent republic in 1979, the United States and Kiribati signed the Treaty of Tarawa, under which the United States released all claims to the Phoenix Islands (except for Baker and Howland), which thenceforth became recognized as part of Kiribati.

The Phoenix Islands began to be known by that name sometime around the 1840s, as a generalization from one of the islands in the group, which had been named Phoenix Island earlier in the century (probably because Phoenix was a common name for the whaling ships that frequented the nearby waters at the time).

The Phoenix Islands were the site of the last colonial expansion attempted by the British Empire (through the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme) in the late 1930s.

==Geography, flora and fauna==
===Canton Island===


Canton Island (also called Abariringa) is the northernmost island in the Phoenix group and the only inhabited one. It is a narrow ribbon of land , enclosing a lagoon of approximately . Canton is mostly bare coral, covered with herbs, bunch grasses, low shrubs, and a few trees. Its lagoon teems with 153 known species of marine life, including sharks, tuna, stingrays, and eels. Land fauna includes at least 23 bird species, lizards, rats, hermit crabs, and turtles.

In the mid-20th century, Canton had an important trans-Pacific airport and refueling station called Langton, but its importance declined in the late 1950s with the introduction of long-range jet aircraft. After a brief stint as a U.S. missile-tracking station, the airport fell into disuse. However, today, the airport is still there, and () it was still home to a small military presence: 20 persons were residing there, mostly living in the buildings erected during the occupation of the island by Great Britain and the United States between 1936 and 1976.

===Enderbury Island===
Enderbury is a low, flat, small coral atoll lying east-southeast of Canton. Its lagoon is rather tiny, comprising only a small percentage of the island&#x27;s area. Herbs, bunchgrass, morning-glory vines, and a few clumps of trees form the main vegetation on the island, while birds, rats, and a species of beetle are the known fauna. Heavily mined for guano in the late 19th century, Enderbury has seen little human impact following the evacuation of the last four residents in 1942, during World War II.

===Birnie Island===
Birnie Island is a small, flat coral island about in area, measuring long by wide. It contains a tiny lagoon, which has all but dried up. A nesting place for flocks of seabirds, Birnie is devoid of trees and is instead covered with low shrubs and grass. Unlike most of the other Phoenix Islands, Birnie does not appear to have been worked for guano or otherwise exploited by humans. It was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1975.

===McKean Island===
McKean Island is the northwesternmost island of the Phoenix group. Its area is , devoid of fresh water or trees, though it has a hypersaline lagoon at its center. Carpeted with low herbs and grasses, McKean provides a sanctuary for the world&#x27;s largest nesting population of lesser frigatebird (&quot;Fregata ariel&quot;), with a population of up to 85,000 birds. It was actively worked for guano in the mid-19th century but was abandoned by 1870, and no further use has been made of it.

===Rawaki Island===
Rawaki, or Phoenix Island, measures approximately by , and covers in area. Its lagoon is shallow and salty, with no connection to the ocean. However, it has several freshwater pools—the only known freshwater wetlands in the Phoenix Islands. Treeless, Rawaki is covered with herbs and grasses, and provides another important landing site for migratory seabirds. Worked for guano from 1859 to 1871, Rawaki was abandoned and no human use seems to have been made of it thereafter.

===Manra Island===
Manra, or Sydney Island, measures approximately . It has a large, salty lagoon with depths reportedly varying between . The island is covered with coconut palms, scrub forest, herbs, and grasses, including the species &quot;Tournefortia, Pisonia, Morinda, Cordia, Guettarda,&quot; and &quot;Scaevola&quot;. Manra contains definite evidence of prehistoric inhabitation in the form of at least a dozen platforms and remains of enclosures in the northeast and northwest portions of the island. K. P. Emory, an ethnologist at Honolulu&#x27;s Bishop Museum, has estimated that two groups of people were present on Manra, one having migrated there from eastern Polynesia, the other from Micronesia. Wells and pits apparently dug by inhabitants were also found.

Extensively worked for guano beginning in 1884 by John T. Arundel &amp; Co, Manra was developed into a copra plantation in the early 20th century. In 1938, Manra was selected as one of three atolls to be included in the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, which represented the final expansion of the British Empire. Manra was subsequently plagued by drought and the death of the project&#x27;s organizer. Due to these events, the effects of World War II, and the declining copra market, the island was abandoned in 1963.

===Nikumaroro===
Nikumaroro, or Gardner Island, is approximately long by wide, enclosing a large central lagoon. Vegetation is profuse, including scrub forests, coconut palms, and herbs. Large quantities of birds nest on the island, which was once the headquarters for the British colonial officer heading up the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, Gerald Gallagher. Gallagher constructed a village on the western end of the atoll, with wide, coral-paved streets, a parade ground, a cooperative store, an administrative center and residence, and a radio shack.

Gallagher died on Nikumaroro in 1941, and was buried on the island (where his empty grave monument can still be seen, though his remains were later moved to Tarawa). Like the other atolls in the settlement project, Nikumaroro was abandoned in 1963 due to the scarcity of fresh water, together with the declining market for the copra that had been produced on the island.

Nikumaroro has appeared in media stories due to a theory that Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan might have landed their plane at low tide on the edge of the atoll&#x27;s barrier reef during their fateful around-the-world attempt in 1937. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) made several expeditions to Nikumaroro during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, finding possible evidence, but no conclusive proof, for this theory. Investigation and expeditions to the island continue.

===Orona Island===
Orona, or Hull Island, measures approximately , and, like Canton, is a narrow ribbon of land surrounding a sizable lagoon with depths of between . Like Manra, it is covered with coconut palms, scrub forest, and grasses; it also contains evidence of prehistoric Polynesian habitation. An ancient stone marae stands on the eastern tip of the island, together with ruins of shelters, graves and other platforms. Unlike Manra, Orona does not seem to have been worked for guano, but it became a coconut plantation and was made a p. It was the British Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme. Residents were evacuated in 1963 due to drought and the declining copra market.
==History of the islands==
===Early history===
Evidence suggests that Howland Island was the site of a prehistoric settlement, which may have extended down to Rawaki, Canton, Manra, and Orona—probably in the form of a single community using several adjacent islands. Archaeological sites have been discovered on Manra and Orona that suggest there were two distinct groups of settlers, one from eastern Polynesia and one from Micronesia. The hard life on these isolated islands undoubtedly led either to the extinction or emigration of these settled peoples, in much the same way that other islands in the area (such as Christmas Island and Pitcairn) were abandoned.

These ancient settlements were probably founded around 1000 BC when eastern Melanesians are known to have traveled northward across the water. Later settlement by Polynesians and contact with Polynesia is evident from archaeological digs. These have yielded basalt artifacts that originated in Samoa, the Marquesas, and the Cook Islands and were transported to the Phoenix and Line Islands during the 12th–14th centuries AD.

===Secondary discovery and mapping of the islands===
In 1568, when Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira was commanded to explore the South Pacific, he sailed between the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands without sighting land, ultimately discovering &quot;Isla de Jesus&quot; (probably one of the islands in the Ellice group).

The oceans of the mid-Pacific and Micronesia opened up to new exploration in the early 19th century as whalers from Europe and the Americas began arriving. An influx of whaling vessels in the 1820s led to the secondary discovery and mapping of the islands between 1821 and 1825. They were the last islands in the Pacific to be fully explored and charted, probably because they were predominantly small, low, and isolated.

While it is clear that early 19th-century whalers were responsible for discovering most of Kiribati in the modern era, it is impossible to confirm exactly who discovered each of the islands due to conflicting reports and inaccurate mapping. Jeremiah N. Reynolds&#x27;s 1828 report to the American Navy recommended an exploring expedition to the Pacific because &quot;the English charts, and those of other countries are as yet very imperfect. Much of their information has been obtained from loose accounts from whalers who were careless in some instances, and forgetful in others, and which were seized with greediness by the makers of maps and charts, in order to be the first to make these discoveries known.&quot;

This proposal came to fruition in the 1840s, when Charles Wilkes led the United States Exploring Expedition, consisting of the and the . The expedition surveyed the islands under the direction of William Hudson.

===Identifying the secondary discoverers===
Contemporary reports and later analysis provide conflicting evidence regarding the identification of the initial discoverers, a situation only complicated by the numerous names given to each of the atolls.

In 1828, the U.S. Navy commissioned J.N. Reynolds to compile a survey of American discoveries in the South Pacific. Reynolds interviewed several New England whalers and inspected their logbooks, charts, and documents. His report included at least 13 islands that fit roughly within the Phoenix group, but the coordinates he gave do not always compare to the now-established coordinates of that area.

Other contemporary reports of the islands added to the confusion about the details of the initial discoveries. The Frenchman Louis Tromelin reported his 1823 discovery of Phoenix island at 3°42&#x27;S, 170°43&#x27;W, while cartographer John Arrowsmith plotted it 12 minutes further north; a rediscovery of Sydney is at 4°26&#x27;30&quot;, 171°18&#x27;. The same year, James Coffin recorded &quot;Enderby&#x27;s Island&quot; at 3°10&#x27;, 171°10.

The United States Exploring Expedition seems to have been the first to use the name &quot;Phoenix&quot; to refer to the whole island group. It had previously been used only to refer to one of the islands within the group.

====McKean Island====
McKean Island was the first of the Phoenix group to be reported and named. It was discovered on May 28, 1794, by a British captain, Henry Barber, of the ship &quot;Arthur&quot;. Barber named it &quot;Drummond&#x27;s Island&quot;, plotting it at 3°40&#x27;S, 176°51&#x27;W. It was later named &quot; Arthur Island&quot; and appeared as such in charts of the time and was recorded as located at 3°30&#x27;S, 176°0&#x27;W. On August 19, 1840, Commander Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition mapped it and renamed it &quot;McKean Island&quot;, after a member of his crew.

====Enderbury Island====
Captain James Coffin of the British whaler &quot;Transit&quot; is credited with having discovered Enderbury Island in 1823 and named it &quot;Enderby&#x27;s Island&quot; after the London whaling house. However, when Coffin described his discoveries to Arrowsmith and other geographers, he did not mention Enderbury.

====Birnie Island and Manra (Sydney Island)====
Birnie and Sydney Islands are reported to have been discovered in 1823 by a &quot;Captain Emmett&quot;. This may have been the Captain Emmett (or &quot;Emmert&quot; or &quot;Emment&quot;) of the British whaler (or the &quot;Sydney&quot;), who may have named the islands after the ship and its owner, the London firm Alexander Birnie &amp; Co. Alternatively, it may have been Captain William Emmett, from Sydney, who sailed regularly in the area and is known to have bought the brig &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; from the whaler James Birnie (of the Birnie ship owning family) in 1820. Frenchman Louis Tromelin came upon Sidney&#x27;s Island, either in 1823 or 1828, and placed it at 4°26&#x27;30&quot;, 171°18&#x27;; he went on to survey Phoenix Island.

====Canton Island or Kanton or Abariringa====
Two islands that were reported and charted in 1825 with coordinates similar to those of Canton Island were referred to in those documents as &quot;Mary Island&quot; and &quot;Mary Balcoutts Island&quot;. In addition, Reynold&#x27;s report describes a &quot;Barney&#x27;s Island&quot; roughly at Canton&#x27;s position, which may have been named and discovered by Capt. Joseph Barney of &quot;Equator&quot;, who was whaling in the area in 1823–4. The island was given the name &quot;Canton&quot; in 1872 by Commander Richard W. Meade of , who named it after the whaling ship &quot;Canton&quot;, which had been wrecked there in 1854.

====Nikumaroro (Gardner Island)====
On January 8, 1824, Capt. Kemin, of an unnamed ship, discovered what may have been Gardner Island (at 4°45&#x27;S, 186°20&#x27;15&quot;E) and McKean Island, naming them the &quot;Kemin Islands&quot;. In 1825, Captain Joshua Gardner, reportedly aboard the whaler , discovered an island located at 4°20&#x27; S, 174°22&#x27; W, and named it &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Island&quot;. His discovery was reported in the &quot;Nantucket Enquirer&quot; in December 1827. However, Joshua Coffin (also reportedly aboard the &quot;Ganges&quot;) is sometimes credited with the discovery, and is said to have named the island after his ship&#x27;s owner, Gideon Gardner.

During the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842, Charles Wilkes identified Gardner&#x27;s Island based on the previously reported position and confirmed its existence.

==== Rawaki (Phoenix Island) ====
The Frenchman Louis Tromelin, aboard the corvette &quot;Bayonnaise&quot;, came across Phoenix Island (as well as Sydney Island, discussed above), probably in 1828 (but some sources give 1823 as the date). and 1826. Tromelin placed the island at 3°42&#x27;S, 189°17&#x27;E, and noted his belief that it had already been reported on Norie&#x27;s map. Reynold&#x27;s report also mentions an island referred to as &quot;Phenix&quot;, as well as other unnamed islands, at similar coordinates. The island&#x27;s discoverer and the origin of its name are unknown. Still, there are several possible candidates: the whaling ship of Nantucket, Massachusetts, which was active in the area and was the discoverer of Winslow Reef; the London whaler &quot;Phoenix&quot;, owned by Daniel Bennett (W. Bennett &amp; Co), which was whaling in the Pacific in 1815; the , under the command of John Palmer in 1824; and another vessel named the , under the command of a Captain Moore, which was in the Pacific in 1794.

====Orona (Hull Island)====
Little is known about the discovery of Hull Island, but its existence was confirmed by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1841, which found it to be inhabited), and it was named by Charles Wilkes after Commodore Isaac Hull.

====Winslow Reef====
The reef was discovered in 1851 by the whaler . Perry Winslow was the ship&#x27;s master on that occasion. Some have speculated this could have been the ship after which the Phoenix Island group is named. Still, several other whaling ships of the time were also named Phoenix, and one of the individual islands in the group had already been reported at an earlier date to bear the name &quot;Phoenix Island&quot;.

====Carondelet Reef====
Reynold&#x27;s report of 1828 included an unnamed reef at coordinates similar to those of Carondelet Reef.

====Baker Island====
In August 1825, Captain Obed Starbuck of the whaler &quot;Loper&quot; sighted a low, barren island at 0°11&#x27;N, 176°20&#x27;W, which he named &quot;New Nantucket&quot; after his home (Nantucket, Massachusetts). Starbuck had previously discovered islands in the Ellice group. The island was later named after Capt. Michael Baker, who had discovered guano deposits on the island in 1839. Today, Baker Island is a United States territory; it is one of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.

====Howland Island====
Howland Island is a United States territory and one of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands. The discovery of Howland Island is sometimes credited to Captain George B Worth of the Nantucket whaler , around 1822, who called it &quot;Worth Island&quot;. Daniel MacKenzie of the American whaler &quot;Minerva Smith&quot;, charted the island in 1828, and, believing it to be a discovery, named it after his ship&#x27;s owners.

===Later history===
Most of the Phoenix Islands were annexed by Great Britain in the late 19th century. The United States claimed Howland and Baker Islands in 1935. In 1937, Britain incorporated all the islands in the Phoenix group, except for Howland and Baker islands, into the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. The United States claimed sovereignty over Canton and Enderbury in 1938, but in 1939 agreed with Britain to form the Canton and Enderbury Islands condominium and exercise joint control over the two islands for a term of 50 years. (The agreement continued in force until 1979 when Kiribati&#x27;s independence nullified it.) During this period of joint U.S.-British control, Canton was extensively developed, first as a seaplane-landing site, then later as a refueling station for trans-Pacific civilian and military aircraft. It remained in use until 1958.

Although shelled and bombed a few times during World War II, neither Canton nor any of the Phoenix Islands was ever occupied by Japanese forces.

Between 1938 and 1940, to reduce overcrowding on the Gilbert Islands, the previously uninhabited Orona (Hull), Manra (Sydney), and Nikumaroro (Gardner) islands were colonized as part of the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme. By 1963, however, the settlements on these three islands were deemed to be unworkable, and the entire population was moved to the Solomon Islands.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, the United States used Canton as a missile-tracking station. The island was abandoned in 1976 but then later resettled by members of the I-Kiribati community, who reside there today. In 2008, the government of Kiribati designated the islands the &quot;Phoenix Islands Protected Area&quot;, which was at the time the world&#x27;s largest marine protected area. Collaborations between Kiribati, the New England Aquarium, and Conservation International have allowed scientific expeditions to explore the Phoenix Islands to quantify the ocean&#x27;s flora and fauna. This area is of particular scientific interest because it has been relatively untouched by human activity.

The Phoenix Islands have been surveyed by TIGHAR in an attempt to determine whether they may have been the landing site of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan, who disappeared in 1937 over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island while attempting a circumnavigational flight of the globe.

In May 2010, it was reported that a British sailor, Alex Bond, from Penryn, Cornwall, had saved a group of &quot;desperate and starving&quot; Kanton islanders after chancing upon them on his way to Australia. He happened to pull into a lagoon near Canton Island (which is the only habitable island in the Phoenix Islands chain and lies to the northeast of Australia), whereupon he discovered that its 24 residents were destitute. A supply ship expected to bring them food four months earlier had never arrived, and the 10 children and 14 adults had been surviving on fish and coconuts. At the time, Bond was reportedly working for a UK-based disaster-relief charity, ShelterBox, which provides emergency aid to needy people. He contacted the coast guard in Falmouth, England, using his satellite phone, and they, in turn, arranged for the U.S. Coast Guard to send supplies to the islanders from Honolulu, Hawaii.

<text>George Perry Graham, (March 31, 1859 – January 1, 1943) was a journalist, editor and politician in Ontario, Canada.

In the 1898 Ontario provincial election, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Brockville, and re-elected in 1902 and 1905. In 1904, he was appointed to the cabinet as Provincial Secretary by Premier George William Ross and served in that position until the Ross government lost the election of 1905.

When Ross resigned as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1907, Graham briefly succeeded him, but quickly left later that year for federal politics when he was appointed Minister of Railway and Canals in the Liberal government of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

Ross won the Brockville seat in the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election in 1907. He was defeated in the 1911 federal election that brought Robert Borden&#x27;s Conservatives to power, but returned to the House of Commons in a 1912 by-election. He did not run in the 1917 election, but then was elected in Essex South in 1921.

In 1921, he served in a number of defence portfolios (Minister of Militia and Defence and Minister of the Naval Service from 1921 to 1922 and then as Minister of Defence from January 1 to April 27, 1923) in the first cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King. He lost his seat in the 1925 federal election, but was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1926, and sat in that body until his death in 1943.

<doc id="543174" wikidata="Q7712467" url="?curid=543174" title="The Adventure of the Sealed Room">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Sealed Room&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes murder mystery by Adrian Conan Doyle (the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator) and John Dickson Carr. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 13 June 1953, and was illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;.

The story is a locked-room mystery. It expands on the comment by Doctor Watson in &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot;: &quot;Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice -- that of Mr. Hatherley&#x27;s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton&#x27;s madness.&quot;

== Plot ==
Rising early one morning for his medical practice, Dr Watson discovers that his first patient is Cora Murray, his wife&#x27;s friend. She informs Watson that Colonel Warburton is dead. His wife, Eleanor Warburton, is horribly wounded. Because the couple had locked themselves in a room with a collection of Indian antiquities before the gunshots were heard, the incident appears to be a murder–suicide caused by a sudden fit of madness in the Colonel.

Watson escorts Miss Murray to Sherlock Holmes&#x27; residence at 221B Baker Street, and Holmes soon becomes interested in the case. Holmes learns that Miss Murray, Major Earnshaw, and Captain Lasher (the Colonel&#x27;s nephew) were all in the house at the time of the tragedy, along with a sinister Indian servant.

<doc id="543175" wikidata="Q70546" url="?curid=543175" title="Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb">
<text>Wilhelm Josef Franz Ritter von Leeb (5 September 1876 – 29 April 1956) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the Second World War, who was subsequently convicted of war crimes. Leeb was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the Military Order of Max Joseph which granted him the title of nobility. During the Battle of France, he commanded Army Group C, responsible for the breakthrough of the Maginot Line.

During Operation Barbarossa—the invasion of the Soviet Union—Leeb commanded Army Group North, which advanced through the Baltic States towards Leningrad (present day St. Petersburg), eventually laying siege to the city. Units under Leeb’s command committed war crimes against the civilian population and closely cooperated with the SS &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, death squads primarily tasked with the murder of the Jewish population as part of the Holocaust.

Leeb was a beneficiary of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s bribery scheme for senior Wehrmacht officers, receiving secret, extra-legal gifts of 250,000 Reichsmark in 1941 and of an estate valued at 638,000 Reichsmark in 1943. Following the war, Leeb was tried in the High Command Trial as part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. He was convicted of transmitting the Barbarossa Decree and its criminal application by subordinate units and sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment time served and was therefore released after the trial concluded.

==Early life==
Leeb was born in 1876 in Landsberg am Lech as Wilhelm Josef Franz Leeb into a Roman Catholic family. Wilhelm joined the Bavarian Army in 1895 and served in China during the Boxer Rebellion. Between 1907 and 1913, he attended the Bavarian War Academy and served on the General Staff. 

==World War I and interwar period==
At the outbreak of World War I, Leeb rejoined the Bavarian Army. He served on the Eastern Front, where he distinguished himself in the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive, the capture of the fortress Przemyśl and the campaign in Serbia. In 1915, he was awarded the Military Order of Max Joseph, the receipt of which conferred a title of nobility. Leeb&#x27;s surname changed to &quot;Ritter von Leeb&quot;.

After the war, Leeb remained in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, the army of the Weimar Republic. Before the rise of Adolf Hitler to power, Leeb commanded the military district covering Bavaria. In July 1938, Leeb was given command of the 12th Army, which took part in the occupation of the Sudetenland.

==World War II==
At the start of World War II, the 63-year-old Ritter von Leeb was the second-oldest general, after Gerd von Rundstedt, who was 64. In the summer of 1939, Leeb was given command of Army Group C and promoted to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; on 1 November 1939. He opposed the plans for the Battle of France the 1940 offensive through the neutral Low Countries and wrote, &quot;The whole world will turn against Germany, which for the second time within 25 years assaults neutral Belgium! Germany, whose government solemnly vouched for and promised the preservation of and respect for this neutrality only a few weeks ago&quot;. During the battle, his troops broke through the Maginot Line. Leeb was promoted to the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony and was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

During Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, Leeb was given command of Army Group North to invade the Baltic states and to capture Leningrad. Leeb was one of more than 200 senior officers who on 30 March 1941 attended a speech in which Hitler laid out his plans for an ideological war of annihilation (&quot;Vernichtungskrieg&quot;) against the Soviet Union.

====Baltic states====
In June 1941, Army Group North, composed of Panzer Group 4, the 16th Army and the 18th Army, overwhelmed Soviet border defences and in the Baltic Operation rapidly advanced through the Baltic states by capturing Kaunas and Riga by 1 July. Leeb had jurisdiction over the area of military operations and over the Army Group North Rear Area. In late June and early July 1941, Franz von Roques, the Rear Area commander, informed Leeb of the massacres of Jews by &quot;Einsatzgruppe A&quot;, Lithuanian auxiliaries and the men of the 16th Army outside Kaunas. Leeb noted in his diary afterwards that all he could do was to &quot;keep one’s distance&quot; and that both men agreed it might be &quot;more humane&quot; to sterilise the Jewish men. Leeb approved of the killing of Jewish men and claimed their crimes during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania justified it but that the killing of women and children might have been excessive.

In early July, General Rudolf Schmundt, Hitler&#x27;s aide responsible for the disbursing secret extra-legal payments from the &quot;Konto 5&quot; fund, visited the headquarters of Army Group North. He told Leeb&#x27;s staff that the pogroms against and the murder of the Jews by &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; A were a &quot;necessary cleaning up operation&quot; and that &quot;soldiers should not concern themselves with political matters&quot;. Leeb received 250,000 Reichsmarks from the fund in September 1941 for his birthday. The same month, Franz Walter Stahlecker, the commander of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; A, in a report to Berlin praised Army Group North for its exemplary co-operation with his men in murdering Jews in the Baltic states.

====Advance on Leningrad====

Soviet resistance stiffened significantly as the army group crossed the Latvian–Russian border in early July 1941. At the same time, &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH, German Army High Command) ordered that Panzer Group 3 was no longer to support Army Group North and was to focus solely on Army Group Centre, leaving Leeb to pursue his objectives, Novgorod, Pskov and Luga, as well as Estonia, without the support of an additional Panzer group. Leeb did not protest, presumably because he believed in the superiority of the German forces and that resistance by the Red Army would not affect his operations. In contrast to those expectations, the marshy terrain around Lake Ilmen and fierce Red Army counterattacks prevented a quick advance.

By early August, Army Group North was seriously overextended, having advanced on a widening front and dispersed its forces on several axes of advance. Leeb estimated that he needed 35 divisions for all of his tasks, but he only had 26. The attack resumed on 10 August but immediately encountered strong opposition around Luga. Leeb&#x27;s forces were able to take Kingisepp and Narva on 17 August. The army group reached Chudovo on 20 August, severing the rail link between Leningrad and Moscow. Tallinn fell on 28 August. Units under Leeb&#x27;s command engaged in widespread plunder of foodstuffs as they advanced. Excessive looting prompted Leeb to issue orders in an attempt to limit looting and destruction of property because they would impede the exploitation of the conquered lands. Leeb&#x27;s order of 16 August 1941 stated that &quot;the start-up work of the economic authorities is being rendered impossible by the senseless &#x27;organisations&#x27; of the troops&quot;.
The last rail connection to Leningrad was cut on 30 August, when the German forces reached the River Neva. In early September, Leeb was confident Leningrad was about to fall. Having received reports on the evacuation of civilians and industrial goods, Leeb and OKH believed the Red Army was preparing to abandon the city. On 5 September, he received new orders, including the destruction of the Red Army forces around the city. By 15 September, Panzer Group 4 was to be transferred to Army Group Centre to participate in a renewed offensive towards Moscow. The expected surrender did not materialise although the renewed German offensive cut off the city by 8 September. Lacking sufficient strength for major operations, Leeb had to accept the army group might not be able to take the city but hard fighting continued along his front throughout October and November.

Since September, the headquarters of the army group and OKH had pondered the fate of the city and what to do with the starving Soviet population. Leeb ordered the artillery to fire at any civilians trying to escape from the encircled city to kill them out of view of the frontline infantry. In mid-November, the army group&#x27;s war diary noted the artillery was preventing civilians from approaching the German lines. The operations led the command to ponder whether the shooting of unarmed civilians would lead to the &quot;loss of inner balance&quot;. Senior officers were also concerned about &quot;false&quot; compassion that might affect the fighting qualities of their men. Forces under Leeb&#x27;s command killed Romani people, handed others over to the units of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) and participated in the killing of mentally disabled people. In December 1941, with the consent of 18th Army commander Georg von Küchler, SD personnel shot 240 patients in a psychiatric facility.

===Relieved of command===
On 15 December 1941, in the midst of the crisis of the Battle of Moscow, Leeb pulled back his forces on the northern wing to a line behind the Volkhov River without permission from OKH. Leeb gained approval for the measure the following day in a personal meeting with Hitler in the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot;. On 15 January 1942, Leeb asked Hitler to give him freedom of action or to relieve him of his command. Hitler chose the latter and Küchler assumed command of Army Group North. Hitler never employed Leeb again but Hitler&#x27;s gratitude lasted until he killed himself in April 1945. After Leeb joined the &quot;Führerreserve&quot; in 1942, Leeb turned to Hans Heinrich Lammers and indicated that in addition to his estate at Solln on the outskirts of Munich, he wanted an estate in the countryside. Hitler promptly presented him with one at Seestetten, near Passau. According to &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (regional Nazi Party leader) Paul Giesler, it was worth an estimated minimum of 660,000 Reichsmarks.

==Trial and conviction==

Leeb was tried by the United States military tribunal in Nuremberg in the High Command Trial. Leeb&#x27;s defence attorney Hans Laternser acted as the de facto lead defence counsel and often represented other parties in matters of procedure. He defended the &quot;decency&quot; of the German officer corps and asserted that it had displayed respect for the laws of war. The defence attributed the actions of the German military against civilians, hostages and partisans to battle conditions and military necessity. Addressing the criminal orders that Leeb and other defendants had passed on, Laternser claimed that Leeb was a humane soldier who had neither seen nor transmitted such orders and had no opportunity to countermand them. He claimed that Leeb knew nothing of the activities of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in his area of command and anyway had no jurisdiction to stop them.
As the most senior officer of those on trial, Leeb presented a closing statement on behalf of the defendants. He stated the accused never compromised their soldierly principles and presented them as victims of history: &quot;No soldier in all the world has ever yet had to fight under such a load and tragedy&quot;. His statement foreshadowed the narrative of victimisation prevalent in West Germany in the 1950s and the 1960s. Leeb was found guilty on one of four charges; he was convicted of transmitting the Barbarossa Decree and its criminal application by subordinate units. He was sentenced to time served and was released after trial. The sentence was lighter than those of other convicted defendants. The judgement stated, &quot;No criminal order has been introduced [into evidence] that bears his signature or stamp of his approval&quot;. After Leeb was released, he returned to his estate in Hohenschwangau, Bavaria. He died of a heart attack in 1956 in Füssen and was buried in the Solln Waldfriedhof.

<text>John James &quot;Joe&quot; Greene (24 June 1920 – 23 October 1978) was a Canadian politician.

==Life and career==
Greene was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Andrée (née Charpagnol) and Peter Greene. He grew up in Toronto before finding work in northern Ontario as a mine worker. 

After graduating from the University of Toronto Schools, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. Following the war, he earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto and a law degree from Osgoode Hall. He began practice in Toronto, establishing a law firm in Arnprior, Ontario in 1949. In 1948, he married Corinne Bedore.

He ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1958, placing a poor third at the party&#x27;s leadership convention.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the 1963 general election. In 1964, he ran again for the leadership of the Ontario Liberals, placing fourth.

In 1965, he became Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet of Lester Pearson, one of the few non-farmers to hold the position and the first easterner in 54 years. In 1968, he ran to succeed Pearson in that year&#x27;s federal Liberal leadership convention, but despite giving what many say was the best speech, he came in fifth place. After three ballots, he threw his support to Pierre Trudeau, contributing towards his victory. The new Prime Minister made Greene Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.

Greene moved to the riding of Niagara Falls, Ontario in the 1968 election, and was again elected to Parliament. As energy minister, Greene prevented the sale of both the largest oil company under Canadian control and Canada&#x27;s largest uranium producer to Americans.

Greene suffered a heart attack in 1969, and was required to take a temporary leave of absence from parliament. Otto Lang served as the acting minister of Energy, Mines and Resources in this period. Green later suffered a stroke in late 1971. Greene retired from cabinet in January 1972 when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada.

He died in 1978, aged 58.

<text>&quot;Un Poco Loco&quot; is an Afro-Cuban jazz standard composed by American jazz pianist Bud Powell. It was first recorded for Blue Note Records by Powell, Curly Russell, and Max Roach on May 1, 1951.

==Musical characteristics==

&quot;Un Poco Loco&quot; is in thirty-two bar form. It uses the lydian scale, incorporating chords overlapping chords to imply a polytonality (D major 7 over C major 7: CEGBDF#AC#) with the improvisation based on an alternating polytonality and an altered dominant chord. Particularly remarkable to jazz musicians is the placement of C# against a C major 7 chord; James Weidman attributed this to bitonality, while Tardo Hammer attributed it to an extension of the circle of fifths.

==Legacy==
In the late 1980s, literary and cultural critic Harold Bloom included &quot;Un Poco Loco&quot; in his list of the most &quot;sublime&quot; works of twentieth-century American art (from his introduction to &quot;Modern Critical Interpretations: Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;).

<text>Foggy Bottom is a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States, located in the city&#x27;s northwest quadrant. It stretches west of the White House towards the Potomac River, north of the National Mall, east of Georgetown, south of the West End neighborhood and west of Downtown D.C. 

The neighborhood is best known for hosting the headquarters of the U.S. Department of State, for which the name &quot;Foggy Bottom&quot; is commonly used as a metonym. It is also home to federal agencies and international institutions, including the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund; the core of the neighborhood is occupied by George Washington University. 

Within greater Foggy Bottom, there is a four block Historic District with modest row houses and alleys dating from as early as the 1870s and which housed working class Irish, German and African Americans during the historic period of 1860-1915. 

==History==

The Foggy Bottom area was the site of one of the earliest European settlements in what is now Washington, D.C., when German settler Jacob Funk (or Funck) subdivided near the meeting place of the Potomac River and Rock Creek in 1763. The settlement officially was named &quot;Hamburgh&quot;, but colloquially was called &quot;Funkstown&quot;. In 1765, German settlers established the town of Hamburg on what would become the area between 24th and 18th NW Street. There are reportedly two more founders: Robert Peter and James Linigan. The three had control of the land until 1791 when the territories were given to the city of Washington and the United States government. In the town of Hamburg, a German community was founded by many German immigrants.

In 1768, Funk sold two lots of territory to both the German Lutheran and the German Presbyterian communities. The lot that was sold to the German Lutherans was located on the corner of 20th and G Street. The lot sold to the German Presbyterians was located on the southeast corner of 22nd and G Street. The Lutheran lot would not be in use until 1833 and the Presbyterian until the 1880s. The lot that was sold to the German Lutheran community was turned into the Concordia German Church.

By the 19th century, Foggy Bottom became a community of laborers employed at the nearby breweries, glass plants, and city gas works. These industrial facilities are also cited as a possible reason for the neighborhood&#x27;s name, the &quot;fog&quot; being the smoke given off by the industries. Foggy Bottom attracted few settlers until the 1850s, when more industrial enterprises came into the area. Funk also set aside land in Hamburgh for a German-speaking congregation in 1768. Concordia German Evangelical Church, located at 1920 G Street NW was finally founded in 1833. Today the congregation is the United Church, and is the oldest religious community remaining in Foggy Bottom.

In 1877 the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) were discovered from the old Naval Observatory in Foggy Bottom, which was located here until 1893.

Foggy Bottom became the site of the George Washington University&#x27;s main campus in 1912.

&quot;Foggy Bottom&quot; was also the name of a line of beer by the Olde Heurich Brewing Company, which was founded by German immigrant Christian Heurich&#x27;s grandson, Gary Heurich. He tried to revive the tradition of his family&#x27;s Christian Heurich Brewing Company, which had ceased production in Foggy Bottom. Christian Heurich Brewing Company&#x27;s most successful products bore such local names as Senate and Old Georgetown. During the 1950s, Heurich Brewing also sponsored the city&#x27;s professional baseball team, the Washington Senators. Industry consolidation led the brewery to cease operations in 1956. In 1961–1962, the brewery buildings were razed to make way for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Heurich Jr., and his two sisters donated a portion of the brewery land to the Kennedy Center in memory of their parents, and established the Christian Heurich Family as one of the Founders of the national cultural center. Although the firm was founded in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, the modern beer was brewed in Utica, New York.

== Points of interest==

Points of interest in Foggy Bottom include the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Friendship Lodge Odd Fellows Hall, and the Watergate complex, site of the Watergate scandal&#x27;s burglaries that led to President Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation. George Washington University has grown significantly over the past decades and now covers much of the neighborhood, which has many historic old homes and numerous mid-rise apartment buildings. The historic portion of the Foggy Bottom neighborhood is preserved and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Just south of the Watergate complex, on the Potomac River, lies the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, home of the National Symphony Orchestra and numerous other theatrical and musical exhibitions. On Virginia Avenue is the Simon Bolivar Memorial. George Washington University&#x27;s Lisner Auditorium and Smith Center are frequently home to major concerts, as is DAR Constitution Hall. Foggy Bottom is also home to the original location of the United States Naval Observatory.

The southern edge of Foggy Bottom is home to many federal government offices, including the State Department. The Main Interior Building (headquarters of the Department of the Interior), the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters, and the Federal Reserve Board buildings all lie on or around Virginia Avenue. To the east lies the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, home to the Executive Office of the President of the United States and the Office of the Vice President of the United States. On the other side of the office is the White House, outside of the neighborhood.

Foggy Bottom is also home to numerous international and American organizations. The World Bank buildings, the International Finance Corporation, the International Monetary Fund, the Office of Personnel Management, DAR Constitution Hall of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Pharmacists Association, the American Red Cross National Headquarters, the Pan American Health Organization, and the Organization of American States are all located in the neighborhood. In addition, the Mexican and Spanish embassies are located in Foggy Bottom, both on Pennsylvania Avenue.

===Alleys===

Foggy Bottom, along with the rest of Washington D.C, was designed using the L&#x27;Enfant Plan, which created squares of housing with open space left in the middle. Foggy Bottom&#x27;s alley life issue emerged during the 1860s when an influx of Irish and German immigrants attempted to move into Foggy Bottom. This influx was a result of the large number of industrial buildings that were located in Foggy Bottom. There were no immediate houses available for these new immigrants, so they were forced to move into the uninhabited alleys that were located in the middle of the squares. The situation became worse after the Civil War when a wave of newly freed Black Americans moved to Washington and began populating the alleys.

Construction of the alleys continued until 1892 because the government needed to reduce overcrowding in residential areas. For the next decade, the government largely left the alleys untouched. However, at the turn of the 20th century, the government began relegating more responsibilities and authority to the Health Department, which began demolishing the alleys because of the copious amounts of crime and disease. The living conditions of the inhabitants were quite abysmal, with half of the population sharing or having no toilet facilities Furthermore, crime was a major problem; a section of Foggy Bottom was nicknamed &quot;Round Tops&quot; because of a well-known gang that was active in the area.

The following decades showed an improvement in the overall living conditions in the alleys of Foggy Bottom. The Health Department&#x27;s effort to reduce crime and overcrowding largely succeeded until the 1920s, when prohibition began being enforced. Because breweries were a major source of income for the inhabitants of Foggy Bottom, prohibition created a new wave of lower-class workers who flocked to the alleys to set up bootleg liquor stores. During this time, the German and the Irish immigrants that had been prevalent since the 1860s began to move out. In 1934, after conditions in the alley had deteriorated, the government created the Alley Dwelling Authority, a new government entity that specifically dealt with improving Washington D.C.’s alleys. The ADA was authorized to demolish or redevelop any alley if it was deemed to be worth saving or not. The addition of the ADA and the arrival of the Department of State began to improve the living conditions in the alleys over time.

The ADA was given the task of evaluating homes and streets to see if they met proper living conditions. Specific documentation would state the reasons why the area needed to be renovated. This documentation would then be sent from the authority to legislation for approval. Individual legislators included, but not exclusively, Eleanor Roosevelt. Common reasons given for why an area was in need of renovation were: too many people in one home; too many African Americans in and around the area; or that the exterior paint had faded. After the ADA gained approval from legislation, it would then give the occupants of the houses anywhere from two to four months to vacate the building. By July 1, 1944, all of the houses in Foggy Bottom had been evacuated and plans were set forward for renovation. This act sought to produce larger living spaces for individuals with better conditions so that the owners could charge more for rent. Higher rent prices were acceptable at the time because of a boom in hiring. Rents usually ranged anywhere from seventeen to thirty-seven dollars a month. These prices fluctuated often because of the available jobs and the condition of the houses. Older houses were typically cheaper than new homes, only some of which came with running water, gas heaters or cooling systems. Statistics suggest that, on average, the greater wealth arose from the majority of white residents, but also that black wealth was steadily increasing due to new job patterns.

===West Station Works===

In 1856, construction began on the West Station Works, a plant owned and operated by the Washington Gas Light corporation, at the intersections of 26th and G St. NW. The construction began the development of the area now occupied by the Watergate complex and throughout broader Foggy Bottom. The location was chosen for its proximity to the Potomac River, which made it convenient to unload barges of coal for the plant. The daily operation of the West Station Works attracted laborers to the area, most of them unskilled. 

By 1860, the unskilled population in Foggy Bottom was at 42%, compared to 9% in 1850. The influx of people spurred development in the area, and 40 years after the works were completed, the area fit the description of a proper city. In 1948, the area of land occupied by the West Station Works was purchased by the Watergate Project. The plant was demolished, and the Watergate complex was constructed on the same plot of land. Today, there is no physical remnant of the plant. It is a historical location today.

==Geography==

It is bounded roughly by 17th Street NW to the east, the Potomac River and Rock Creek Parkway to the west, Constitution Avenue and the National Mall to the south, and Pennsylvania Avenue NW to the north.

Foggy Bottom is thought to have received its name due to an atmospheric quirk of its low lying, marshy riverside location, which made it susceptible to concentrations of fog, and later, industrial smoke. The United States Department of State gained the metonym &quot;Foggy Bottom&quot; when it moved its headquarters to the Harry S Truman Building in 1947.

==Demographics==

Late into the 20th century, Foggy Bottom witnessed a drastic change in demographics. There was a racial transformation within the area, as a white revival emerged. Many different factors forced out the black population, including the Foggy Bottom Taxpayers Protective Association opposing federal intervention. The renovations enacted by the Alley Dwelling Authority rendered the former inhabitants displaced. Similarly, the West End witnessed the same changes. Another factor of the change in demographics was orchestrated by Democratic Senator Theodore G. Bilbo, who called for an &quot;Alley Moving Day&quot; forcing the black population out of the alleys.

The neighborhood is predominately white and has a large number of off-campus university student residents that affect demographics on income, age and race. As of the 2010 United States Census, there are 14,642 residents, of whom 78.3% are white.

<text>USS &quot;Fechteler&quot; (DD-870), named for Rear Admiral Augustus Francis Fechteler USN (1857–1921) and his son Lieutenant Frank Casper Fechteler (1897-1922), was a laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 12 April 1945, launched on 19 September 1945 by Miss Joan S. Fechteler, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Fechteler and niece of Lieutenant Fechteler, (she was also the sponsor of the first USS Fechteler (DE-157)) and commissioned on 2 March 1946.

&quot;Fechteler&quot; operated with the Seventh Fleet in support of United Nations Forces during the Korean War, underwent conversion to a radar picket destroyer from 1 April to 1 December 1953, alternated operations along the west coast and in Hawaiian waters with deployments to the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet, and participated in Sea Dragon and Market Time operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the Vietnam War.

&quot;Fechteler&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 September 1970 and sold for scrap on 28 June 1972.

==Service history==
===Before the Korean War===

Her home port was Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Fechteler&quot; operated with carriers in the Virginia Capes area, and made a brief winter cruise to Argentia, Newfoundland. On 6 January 1947 she sailed from Norfolk for the west coast, and on 26 May sailed from San Diego for her first tour of duty in the Far East. Serving in the occupation, she called at several Chinese ports, as well as at Okinawa, Hong Kong, Yokosuka, and Guam. She returned to San Diego 22 January 1948, to resume west coast training operations.

===Korean War===
&quot;Fechteler&quot; completed a second tour of duty in the Far East in 1949, and in June 1950, when the Korean War broke out, was at sea off San Francisco on exercises. At once she sailed for Pearl Harbor, where she stood by in preparation for the possible spreading of the conflict, and on 14 July returned to San Diego to prepare for Korean service. She served in the Far East on two war-time deployments, the first from 13 November 1950 to 8 August 1951, the second from 23 February 1952 to 29 September 1952. During both of these, she screened TF 77 in its air operations, sailed with the escort and patrol force, and gave bombardment and close gunfire support to the troops ashore.

===Radar picket destroyer===

&quot;Fechteler&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve 1 April 1953, for conversion to a radar picket destroyer. Recommissioned 1 December 1953, she sailed 10 May 1954 for duty in the Far East until 6 September, when she sailed on westward to join the Atlantic Fleet at Newport, arriving 27 October. In addition to participating in the Atlantic schedule of east coast and Caribbean exercises, she also joined in a midshipman cruise in the summer of 1955, voyaging to Málaga, Spain; Plymouth, England; and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

Once more assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Fechteler sailed from Newport 14 May 1956 for Long Beach, which she reached 28 June. In 1956, 1957–58, 1958–59, and 1960, she cruised in the Far East on duty with the 7th Fleet, serving both on the Taiwan Patrol, and with carrier task forces as a radar warning ship.

===FRAM===
In 1963, &quot;Fechteler&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard and received the FRAM I modernisation. She was redesignated DD-870 and operated off Vietnam in the second half of the 1960s.

The destroyer was stricken on 11 September 1970. On 28 June 1972, she was sold to Zidell Explorations Inc. at Portland, Oregon and broken up for scrap.

&quot;Fechteler&quot; received five battle stars for Korean War service.

<text>USS &quot;Damato&quot; (DD-871) was a of the United States Navy. She was named for Corporal Anthony P. Damato USMC (1922–1944), who was killed in action during the Battle of Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

&quot;Damato&quot; was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island in New York on 10 May 1945, launched on 21 November 1945 by Mrs. A. P. Damato and commissioned on 27 April 1946.

==History==

===1947-1962===
From her home port at Newport, Rhode Island, and after December 1947, from Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Damato&quot; cruised the Atlantic Ocean from Cuba to Newfoundland in training and exercises. In the summer of 1949 she carried midshipmen on a training cruise to France and England, and that fall joined in experimental cold-weather operations in Arctic waters.

From September to November 1950, &quot;Damato&quot; had her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, and during the next year joined in hunter-killer operations in the South Atlantic. She was reclassified DDE-871 on 4 March 1951. She returned to the Mediterranean in the fall of 1951, the summers of 1952, 1953, and 1954. In both 1952 and 1953, she joined in autumn North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises in the North Atlantic and during the summer of 1955 joined a Midshipman Training Cruise to Norway and Sweden.

Between October and December 1956, she served with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, and on 12 June 1957 was in Hampton Roads for the International Naval Review. That summer she cruised to Brazil with midshipmen on board for training, then sailed for the Mediterranean in March 1958. She patrolled off the Levant, then passed through the Suez Canal to join the Middle East Force in the Persian Gulf, returning to Norfolk for local operations in September. During 1959 she served with Task Force &quot;Alfa,&quot; concentrating on the development of improved antisubmarine warfare techniques. She visited Quebec, Canada, in July, and in August sailed north again to pass through the St. Lawrence Seaway, dedicated a month previously. She called at Montréal, at Rochester, New York, and arrived at Toronto for the Canadian National Exhibition, joining in the review of NATO naval forces taken by Admiral of the Fleet, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Britain&#x27;s senior military officer. Returning home, &quot;Damato&quot; called at Ogdensburg, New York, and resumed east coast and Caribbean operations through 1962.

===1963-1980===

In 1963, &quot;Damato&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and underwent the FRAM I modernization until February 1964 and was reclassified DD-871. &quot;Damato&quot; then alternated operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean with the 2nd Fleet with deployments to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet. &quot;Damato&quot; served with the Pacific Fleet from June 1967 until February 1968. On 12 and 13 December 1967, Damato conducted naval gunfire support (NGFS) missions while in the Saigon River and has been placed on the US Veterans Administration list of vessels exposed to agent orange thereby making her crew at that time potentially eligible for certain VA benefits. &quot;Damato&quot; was decommissioned in September 1970, and approximately 40% of her officers and crew were transferred and she became of source of spare parts for other ships. Then in November 1970, a decision was made to see how quickly a decommissioned ship could be placed back into combat ready service. Sailors began arriving on board and &quot;Damato&quot; made a brief trip to Newport to cannibalize another ship then had a brief dry-dock session in Portsmouth. &quot;Damato&quot; set sail in January 1971 for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for combat readiness testing. She passed with flying colors and was sent to the Mediterranean to serve with the 6th Fleet. While there, &quot;Damato&quot; spent several days monitoring the activity of a Soviet cruiser off the coast of Libya and managed to shadow and surface a Soviet submarine among other accomplishments. &quot;Damato&quot; received commendations for its combat readiness while in the Mediterranean. Upon returning to Norfolk, VA, it set sail again for the North Atlantic on the western coast of Europe to participate in NATO exercises as a show of force toward the Soviet Union. In 1972 she underwent overhaul in the Bath, ME, shipyard and was then transferred to the reserve fleet operating out of Newport Rhode Island. In 1975 she cruised from Boston to Halifax NS with Boston-area based reservists on board. In 1976 she participated in Bi-Centennial exercises along the Atlantic coast w/ &quot;replenishment&quot; ports-of-call incl. Brunswick, GA and Freeport, Bahamas. She was decommissioned on 30 September 1980 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register.

===Pakistan service===

&quot;Damato&quot; was transferred to Pakistan as &quot;Tippu Sultan&quot;, on 1 October 1980 and scrapped in 1994.

<doc id="543202" wikidata="Q2545760" url="?curid=543202" title="Wax Trax! Records">
<text>Wax Trax! Records is an American independent record label based in Chicago. It began as a record shop in Denver, Colorado, opened by life partners Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher, who sold the store in 1978 and moved to Chicago. In November of that year, they opened a store under the same name in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. During the 1980s and 1990s, the accompanying record label became a strong presence on the industrial music scene as well as the punk rock scene in Chicago, and an outlet for European bands. The label was purchased by TVT Records in 1992 and was discontinued in 2001. In 2014, it was re-established by Julia Nash, daughter of co-founder Jim Nash. On February 6, 2025 the Commission on Chicago Landmarks unanimously voted to declare the old Chicago storefront a landmark.

Richard Giraldi of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;As important as Chess Records was to blues and soul music, Chicago&#x27;s Wax Trax imprint was just as significant to the punk rock, new wave and industrial genres.&quot; According to critic Greg Kot, the legacy of Wax Trax is trusting the artist.

== Origins ==
The record store became a record label slowly at first, initially releasing limited edition records such as Brian Eno&#x27;s “Wimoweh”/“Deadly Seven Finns” seven inch. The first official Wax Trax! release was Strike Under&#x27;s &quot;Immediate Action&quot; twelve inch EP in 1980, followed by Divine&#x27;s &quot;Born To Be Cheap&quot; seven inch. But it was the release of &quot;Cold Life&quot; by Ministry in 1981—along with the licensing of Front 242&#x27;s &quot;Endless Riddance&quot; EP—that set the stage for Wax Trax! to become America&#x27;s preeminent industrial label of the 1980s and 1990s.

== Artists ==

Among the most noteworthy artists released by Wax Trax! were Minimal Compact (&quot;Next One Is Real&quot;), Front 242 (including Jean-Luc De Meyer side project C-Tec), KMFDM, PIG, VNV Nation, Underworld, Meat Beat Manifesto, Front Line Assembly, Young Gods, Sister Machine Gun, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Coil, Chris &amp; Cosey, Chris Connelly, Die Warzau, In the Nursery, Controlled Bleeding, The KLF, Braindead Soundmachine, Cubanate and Laibach. The label also released a bevy of side projects by Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker of Ministry, including Revolting Cocks, Acid Horse (a collaboration with Cabaret Voltaire), Pailhead (a collaboration with Ian Mackaye of Minor Threat), PTP (short for &quot;Programming The Psychodrill&quot;), Lead into Gold (a solo vehicle for Barker), and 1000 Homo DJs.

== Partnerships ==
Nash and Flesher licensed a number of recordings from Play It Again Sam of Belgium, and eventually opened a North American office for the label (dubbed Play It Again Sam Records U.S.A.) as a division of Wax Trax!. Play It Again Sam, in turn, oversaw the operation of Wax Trax! Europe, although it closed abruptly when the relationship between the labels ended acrimoniously in the early 1990s. Play It Again Sam U.S.A. was subsequently absorbed by Caroline Records.

== Bankruptcy and purchase ==
Following a bankruptcy filing, Wax Trax! was bought by New York–based TVT Records in 1992, with Nash and Flesher retaining creative control of the label. TVT continued to use the Wax Trax! imprint for years, even after Nash&#x27;s death from AIDS-related complications on October 10, 1995.

In 1994 TVT released &quot;Black Box - Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years&quot; under the Wax Trax! label. It was a 3-CD box set compilation of the label&#x27;s biggest hits. However, due to licensing issues stemming from the label&#x27;s bankruptcy, the set did not contain any material by Front 242, even though the band&#x27;s single &quot;Headhunter&quot; had been the label&#x27;s best-selling record to date. A video compilation of the same name was also released, containing music videos by label artists (and likewise omitting Front 242&#x27;s &quot;Headhunter&quot; video.)

TVT closed the label&#x27;s doors in 2001, with the final Wax Trax! imprint appearing on KMFDM&#x27;s &quot;Beat By Beat By Beat&quot; DVD. Dannie Flesher retired from the music business and subsequently died of pneumonia on Sunday, January 10, 2010, in Hope, Arkansas. He was 58. Julia Nash owns and maintains the website titled &quot;WaxTraxChicago.com: The Official Family Site dedicated to the memory of Jim Nash / Dannie Flesher and the History of &amp; Wax Trax! Records.&quot;

== Retrospectacle ==
In January 2011, the label announced &quot;Wax Trax! Records Retrospectacle Comes to Metro.&quot; The Retrospectacle was the 33 &amp; 1/3 year Wax Trax! Records Anniversary commemorative concert with proceeds that benefited the non-profit &quot;Center on Halsted;&quot; hosted by &quot;The Nash Group 2449 (The Nash family and friends including Metro Chicago&#x27;s owner Joe Shanahan)&quot; on April 15, 16 and 17th, 2011 in Chicago, Illinois; with performances by former Wax Trax! Artists: Front 242, My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult; Luc van Acker, Paul Barker, and Chris Connelly formerly of Revolting Cocks with special guest Jamie Duffy; and En Esch, Günter Schulz, Raymond Watts formerly of KMFDM; additional artists included Rights of the Accused, as well as Chicago DJ&#x27;s and VJ&#x27;s. 
Notably not included in the event were Ministry&#x27;s Al Jourgensen and KMFDM&#x27;s Sascha Konietzko, who issued a joint statement, saying:&quot;Jourgensen was never asked to participate, and Sascha Konietzko&#x27;s (and KMFDM&#x27;s) desire to participate and perform was &quot;declined&quot; by the event organizers. However, while we are both in no way associated with this event, we want to make it clear that we do support the good works of the charity involved and honor the memory of Wax Trax! founders Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher.&quot; 

==Rebirth==
In June 2014, Jim Nash&#x27;s daughter Julia Nash re-established Wax Trax! Records with the release of a 12-inch single from Cocksure. This was followed shortly afterward with the release of a 7-inch single for Front 242 to mark the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary in the US.

This was accompanied by a pop-up store at the Metro Chicago music venue on June 15, 2014.

== Documentary ==
In 2016 Julia Nash began work on directing and producing a documentary about the history and impact of her father and his partner&#x27;s independent store and label.  The film, titled &quot;INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT: The Story of Wax Trax! Records&quot;, won numerous awards and international acclaim during the 2018 festival circuit.

After seeing the documentary, Vans became an executive producer on the project to help make the film commercially available. In 2019, Vans sponsored in coordination with Record Store Day, a six city North American tour to promote the film. The tour included showcasing the Wax Trax! band Ministry with an early era set.

<text>Donald James Johnston, (June 26, 1936 – February 4, 2022) was a Canadian lawyer, writer and politician who was Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from 1996 to 2006. He was the first non-European to head that organization. From 1978 to 1988, Johnston was a Liberal Party member of the Canadian parliament and served in the cabinets of prime ministers Pierre Trudeau and John Turner. In addition, he was the president of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1990 to 1994. Johnston was an Officer of the Order of Canada, and an Officer of the French National Order of the Legion of Honour.

==Early life==
Johnston was born on June 26, 1936, in Ottawa, Ontario, to Florence (née Tucker) and Wilbur Johnston in a rural family with limited financial means. His father held multiple jobs, including serving as a flying officer during World War I and as a surveyor in Canada&#x27;s north and in Alaska, before returning to Montreal to work as an athletics facilities supervisor at McGill University. Johnston attended the same university receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree before transferring to the university&#x27;s Faculty of Law and graduating in 1958 with a faculty gold medal. In 1958, Johnston went on to pursue advanced studies in economics and political science in Grenoble.

== Career ==

=== Early legal career ===
In 1961, Johnston joined the Montreal-based law firm of Stikeman Elliott at the invitation of John Turner (who would later go on to become Canada&#x27;s 17th prime minister), practicing business and tax law. He partnered with Roy Heenan in 1972 to found their own law firm. The duo would later be joined by Peter Blaikie and formed the Heenan Blaikie law firm. Johnston&#x27;s work at this stage focused on taxation strategies, including the creation of tax shelters, serving as a key enabler for the Canadian film industry. During this time, between 1964 and 1977, he was also a lecturer in fiscal law at the McGill University Faculty of Law.

=== Political career ===
Johnston was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1978 by-election in Westmount in Montreal, Quebec, as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada. As a member of the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1980 to 1984, Johnston successively held the positions of president of the Treasury Board, Minister of State for Science and Technology, and Minister of State for Economic and Regional Development.

When Trudeau announced his retirement in 1984, Johnston ran to succeed him as Liberal leader and prime minister in that year&#x27;s Liberal leadership convention. Johnston came in third in a field of seven, behind John Turner and Jean Chrétien. Johnston served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General in the short-lived Turner government until its defeat in the 1984 federal election.

In opposition, Johnston and Turner split over the issue of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the Meech Lake Accord: in an attempt to boost his poll numbers and that of the divided Liberal caucus on those issues, Turner came out as outspoken opponent of free trade agreement and claimed that overturning what he labeled a sellout of the Canadian public to US interests was his life&#x27;s work. Johnston was opposed to the Accord and for free trade, and on January 18, 1988, he resigned from the Liberal caucus to sit as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; until he retired from Parliament when the 1988 general election was called.

Johnston returned to the Liberal fold in 1990, after Turner&#x27;s resignation as leader, and he served two terms as president of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1990 to 1994, seeing the party through its victory in the 1993 general election.

=== OECD ===
In 1994, the government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien proposed Johnston for the position of secretary-general of the OECD. Johnston was elected to the post in November 1994 by the organization&#x27;s member governments.

As the first non-European to occupy this prestigious position, Johnston began his mandate in 1996 and was elected to a second term in 2001. During his administration, the OECD represented 30 of the most advanced national economies and expanded its engagement to more than 70 non-members, with special country programs for Russia, China, Brazil and India.While the OECD is a forum for macroeconomic policy issues, it also deals with virtually all underlying structural issues including financial markets, trade and investment, taxation and corporate governance.

Under Johnston&#x27;s stewardship, the OECD took the global lead in establishing the Principles of Corporate Governance (now the world standard) and revised the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the bedrock of what is now known as corporate social responsibility. The Organisation also championed the correction of international harmful tax practices and the international harmonization of competition policy, while at the same time fostering sustainable development, which Johnston introduced to the OECD shortly after his arrival. He also created the Education Directorate which introduced the Program of International Student Assessment (PISA), now the leading reference for international educational comparisons.

OECD recommendations in these areas have been critical in enabling countries to structurally adapt to the challenges of globalization while maximizing its benefits to their economies.

Johnston stepped down from his position at the OECD on May 31, 2006.

=== Later career ===
In 2006, Johnston rejoined Heenan Blaikie as a member of the International Business Law Group (the firm was dissolved in 2014). He focused his practice on national and international business law, working with clients to expand their businesses in an increasingly complex and competitive global environment. He was a frequent speaker around the world, addressing a broad range of issues including climate change and energy initiatives.

== Personal life ==
Johnston was married to Heather (née Bell Maclaren). The couple had four daughters. After retirement, the couple split their time between their houses in Quebec, another in Nova Scotia, and another in the south of France.

Johnston died in Quebec on February 4, 2022, at the age of 85.

==Awards and distinctions==
In recognition of his accomplishments at the OECD, Johnston was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, the second most prestigious Japanese decoration and the highest one that can be bestowed on a non-Japanese citizen. He received the Grand-Croix de l’Ordre de Léopold II, one of the highest honorific distinctions in Belgium, given by royal decree and generally reserved for heads of state. He was also presented with the Commander&#x27;s Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic by the president of Hungary and the Order of the White Double Cross, First Class, by the president of the Slovak Republic.

In July 2008, Johnston was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada, in recognition of his contributions to public service in Canada as well as his achievements at the OECD. He was made an Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour in 2011.

He has also received several honorary doctorates – from McGill University, Bishop&#x27;s University, University of King&#x27;s College, McMaster University and the Economics University of Bratislava, Slovakia.

He was given the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 and the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 for service to Canada.

Johnston was the chair of and an advisor to the McCall MacBain Foundation in Geneva. In addition, from 2006 until 2010, he was chairman of the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) in Geneva. From 2006 to 2009, he was a distinguished visiting professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, where he lectured on sustainable development.

<text>The Piper PA-14 Family Cruiser is an American-built small touring aircraft of the late 1940s.

==Design and development==
Piper Aircraft had built the PA-12 Super Cruiser three-seat touring aircraft between early 1946 and March 1948. In 1947, the PA-12 design was adapted to a four-seat layout by widening the cabin by five inches at the instrument panel and adding slotted flaps. The original high-wing and fixed tailwheel undercarriage layout features were retained. The PA-14 prototype made its first flight from the company&#x27;s Lock Haven Pennsylvania factory on 21 March 1947.

==Production and operations==
A second PA-14 was completed on 6 February 1948 and the first customer deliveries were made later that year. 238 examples were completed, most being sold to private owner pilots in the United States, but overseas sales included several to France. The aircraft was launched at a time of serious financial difficulty for the company, and indeed, soon after the release of the Family Cruiser, Piper was placed in receivership, from which it later successfully emerged. 126 examples remained registered in the United States in April 2011, of which 81 were based in Alaska and 13 aircraft were registered in Canada.

<doc id="543213" wikidata="Q7869444" url="?curid=543213" title="USS Forrest Royal">
<text>USS &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; (DD-872) was a United States Navy constructed following the end of World War II. The ship saw service in the Korean War and the Vietnam War before being sold to Turkey in 1971. The ship was renamed TCG &quot;Adatepe&quot; and remained in service until being scrapped in 1993.

&quot;Forrest Royal&quot;, named for Rear Admiral Forrest Beton Royal USN (1893–1945), was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Staten Island, New York on 8 June 1945. The ship was launched on 17 January 1946 by Miss Katherine K. Royal, the daughter of Admiral Royal and commissioned on 29 June 1946.

&quot;Forrest Royal&quot; operated with the 7th Fleet in support of United Nations Forces during the Korean War then alternated operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean with the 2nd Fleet with deployments to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet.

==Service history==

===1946–1960===
&quot;Forrest Royal&quot;″s operations in the period prior to the Korean War illustrated the varied capability of the modern destroyer, and the wide range of missions which such ships are assigned. She conducted special tests for the Bureau of Ships in the Caribbean, served as plane guard and escort for aircraft carriers, took part in the development of antisubmarine warfare and fired in shore bombardment exercises. Usually based at Pensacola, she visited many ports in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.

On 26 September 1950, &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; sailed from Guantanamo Bay for duty in the Korean War, arriving at Sasebo 27 October. Her first assignment was as flagship for the minesweeping at Chinnampo, a port essential to supply operations for the 8th Army. The destroyer&#x27;s other activities included shore bombardment, blockade, and escort all around the Korean coast, and extensive operations with carrier task forces conducting air strikes. She sailed for home 6 June 1951, returning to Norfolk 2 July.

&quot;Forrest Royal&quot; received four battle stars for Korean War service.

&quot;Forrest Royal&quot;″s next deployment, between 26 August 1952 and 29 January 1953, was for a combination of NATO exercises off the coast of Norway, visits to principal ports in northern Europe, 2 months with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, and antisubmarine exercises with British ships off Northern Ireland. Through the next year and a half, the destroyer sailed out of Newport, Rhode Island, for exercises along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean, often serving with carriers out of Pensacola, Florida.

During a cruise around the world between 2 August 1954 and 14 March 1955, &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; sailed westward to serve with the U.S. 7th Fleet in Japanese and Philippine waters, thence onward to the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, returning across the Atlantic to Newport. She made her next visit to the Mediterranean between 14 September 1956 and 3 April 1957, and during the Suez Crisis, patrolled along the Egyptian and Levant coasts. Assigned to service in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Gulf of Suez, &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; made the long voyage around the African continent for this duty, since the Suez Canal was still blocked.
&quot;Forrest Royal&quot; took part in a midshipman cruise to South America in the summer of 1957 as well as the International Naval Review in Hampton Roads on 12 June 1957. NATO operations took her to European waters once more that fall, and on 11 July 1958, she sailed from Newport for Morehead City, North Carolina, where amphibious ships of her force embarked Marines for landing exercises at Puerto Rico. This task force cleared San Juan 1 August to land the marines at Beirut, Lebanon, 20 to 28 August, reinforcing the troops earlier landed in the Navy&#x27;s immediate response to the outbreak of Middle Eastern trouble. &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; sailed on through the Suez Canal to bring her additional strength to the 7th Fleet as it intensified its activities in the Taiwan Straits in response to renewed Communist shelling of Quemoy and Matsu through September. Her homeward bound passage was by way of Cape Town, South Africa, and she returned to Newport 18 November.

A highlight of &quot;Forrest Royal&quot;″s operating schedule in 1959 was her participation in Operation Inland Seas, the movement of a major naval task force into the Great Lakes in connection with the ceremonial opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. She joined in the naval review on Lake Saint-Louis 26 June taken by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain, and called at United States and Canadian ports to greet thousands of visitors. In March 1960, she sailed once more to the Mediterranean to serve with the 6th Fleet and added a brief tour with the Middle East Force prior to her return to the States in October. She operated out of Newport for the remainder of the year.

===1961–1971===
From 24 October to 21 November 1962, &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; was among the US naval vessels deployed during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In May 1967 as part of Task Force 77, &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; took part in Operation Sea Dragon. Although air power was the cutting edge of Task Force 77, surface ships were essential to the interdiction campaign in North Vietnam and Laos. In Operation Sea Dragon, begun in October 1966, cruisers, destroyers, and for one month battleship ranged the North Vietnamese littoral sinking Communist supply craft, shelling coastal batteries and radar sites, and complementing the aerial interdiction effort by bombarding the infiltration routes ashore. While at first restricted to coastal waters south of 17°31&#x27;N, by February 1967 the Sea Dragon force was authorized to operate as far north as the 20th parallel. This area was constricted in April 1968 when the bombing halt ended American combat activity north of the 19th parallel.

Steaming generally in pairs, the two to four American and Australian destroyers and one cruiser worked with carrier-based spotter planes, such as the A-l Skyraider and Grumman S-2 Tracker, to find, identify, and destroy infiltrating vessels and shore targets. Often, North Vietnamese coastal batteries fired back. Although several of the 19 ships that were hit required repairs at shipyards in Japan and the Philippines, no vessel was sunk during the two-year-long Sea Dragon operation. Damaged ships were quickly replaced on the gun line and the coastal deployment was maintained. Periodically, this group reinforced the Seventh Fleet cruisers and destroyers providing naval gunfire support to allied forces in South Vietnam. The naval surface group conducted the Sea Dragon effort until the end of October 1968, when American combat operations in North Vietnam ceased. She accompanied dd-763 on Indian Ocean cruise Nov 1969 returning in May 1970.

=== TCG &quot;Adatepe&quot; (D 353) ===
USS &quot;Forrest Royal&quot; was decommissioned on 27 March 1971, transferred to the Turkish Navy and renamed TCG &quot;Adatepe&quot; (D 353). She was stricken from the United States Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1973. &quot;Adatepe&quot; was seriously damaged in error by Turkish aircraft on 22 July 1974, mistaking it for a Greek vessel during Turkish invasion of Cyprus on Cyprus. The ship was repaired and continued in service with the Turkish Navy until being scrapped in 1993.

<text>Specific activity (symbol &quot;a&quot;) is the activity per unit mass of a radionuclide and is a physical property of that radionuclide.
It is usually given in units of becquerel per kilogram (Bq/kg), but another commonly used unit of specific activity is the curie per gram (Ci/g).

In the context of radioactivity, activity or total activity (symbol &quot;A&quot;) is a physical quantity defined as the number of radioactive transformations per second that occur in a particular radionuclide. The unit of activity is the &quot;becquerel&quot; (symbol Bq), which is defined equivalent to reciprocal seconds (symbol s−1). The older, non-SI unit of activity is the &quot;curie&quot; (Ci), which is radioactive decays per second. Another unit of activity is the &quot;rutherford&quot;, which is defined as radioactive decays per second.

The specific activity should not be confused with level of exposure to ionizing radiation and thus the exposure or absorbed dose, which is the quantity important in assessing the effects of ionizing radiation on humans.

Since the probability of radioactive decay for a given radionuclide within a set time interval is fixed (with some slight exceptions, see changing decay rates), the number of decays that occur in a given time of a given mass (and hence a specific number of atoms) of that radionuclide is also a fixed (ignoring statistical fluctuations).

== Formulation ==
===Relationship between &quot;λ&quot; and T1/2===

Radioactivity is expressed as the decay rate of a particular radionuclide with decay constant &quot;λ&quot; and the number of atoms &quot;N&quot;:

: formula_1

The integral solution is described by exponential decay:

: formula_2

where &quot;N&quot;0 is the initial quantity of atoms at time &quot;t&quot; = 0.

Half-life T1/2 is defined as the length of time for half of a given quantity of radioactive atoms to undergo radioactive decay:

: formula_3

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, the half-life is given by

: formula_4

Conversely, the decay constant &quot;λ&quot; can be derived from the half-life &quot;T&quot;1/2 as

: formula_5

===Calculation of specific activity===

The mass of the radionuclide is given by

: formula_6

where &quot;M&quot; is molar mass of the radionuclide, and &quot;N&quot;A is the Avogadro constant. Practically, the mass number &quot;A&quot; of the radionuclide is within a fraction of 1% of the molar mass expressed in g/mol and can be used as an approximation.

Specific radioactivity &quot;a&quot; is defined as radioactivity per unit mass of the radionuclide:

: formula_7

Thus, specific radioactivity can also be described by

: formula_8

This equation is simplified to

: formula_9

When the unit of half-life is in years instead of seconds:

: formula_10

==== Example: specific activity of Ra-226 ====

For example, specific radioactivity of radium-226 with a half-life of 1600 years is obtained as

: formula_11

This value derived from radium-226 was defined as unit of radioactivity known as the curie (Ci).

===Calculation of half-life from specific activity===
Experimentally measured specific activity can be used to calculate the half-life of a radionuclide.

Where decay constant &quot;λ&quot; is related to specific radioactivity &quot;a&quot; by the following equation:

: formula_12

Therefore, the half-life can also be described by

: formula_13

==== Example: half-life of Rb-87 ====
One gram of rubidium-87 and a radioactivity count rate that, after taking solid angle effects into account, is consistent with a decay rate of 3200 decays per second corresponds to a specific activity of . Rubidium atomic mass is 87 g/mol, so one gram is 1/87 of a mole. Plugging in the numbers:

: formula_14

===Other calculations===
For a given mass formula_15 (in grams) of an isotope with atomic mass formula_16 (in g/mol) and a half-life of formula_17 (in s), the radioactivity can be calculated using:

:formula_18

With formula_19 = , the Avogadro constant.

Since formula_20 is the number of moles (formula_21), the amount of radioactivity formula_22 can be calculated by:

:formula_23

For instance, on average each gram of potassium contains 117 micrograms of 40K (all other naturally occurring isotopes are stable) that has a formula_17 of = , and has an atomic mass of 39.964 g/mol, so the amount of radioactivity associated with a gram of potassium is 30 Bq.

==Examples==
==Applications==
The specific activity of radionuclides is particularly relevant when it comes to select them for production for therapeutic pharmaceuticals, as well as for immunoassays or other diagnostic procedures, or assessing radioactivity in certain environments, among several other biomedical applications.

<text>USS &quot;Hawkins&quot; (DD-873) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. Following the war, the ship saw service in the Korean War and in the 1970s, was transferred to the Republic of China Navy as Tze Yang. She remained in service until the 1990s. The ship was then scrapped with the exception of her superstructure, which became part of a display and training ground at the Zuoying Naval Academy.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Hawkins&quot;, originally to be named &quot;Beatty&quot;, but renamed on 22 June 1944 and launched by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas, 7 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Clara Jane Hawkins, mother of namesake First Lieutenant William Deane Hawkins (killed on Tarawa). The destroyer was commissioned on 10 February 1945.

===Service in the United States Navy===

Following shakedown training in the Caribbean, &quot;Hawkins&quot; arrived at Norfolk on 23 March 1945 to undergo conversion to a radar picket ship. Emerging 26 May, she conducted training exercises before sailing 18 June from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for San Diego and Pearl Harbor. After her arrival 8 July &quot;Hawkins&quot; prepared to enter the last phase of the Pacific War, but 3 days after her 12 August departure from Pearl Harbor for Eniwetok the Japanese surrendered. The destroyer continued from Eniwetok to Iwo Jima and Tokyo Bay, arriving 27 August, and assisted in early occupation operations. She then escorted ships to and from the Marianas, remaining in Japanese waters until 3 January 1946. &quot;Hawkins&quot; then steamed to the Philippines and Saipan, finally arriving Pearl Harbor 3 April.

Arriving at San Diego on 11 April, the destroyer took part in training operations off the West Coast until sailing again for the Far East January 1947. During the months that followed she steamed between Chinese and Korean ports, assisting and supporting American Marine units in their attempts to stabilize the Chinese situation and protect American lives. &quot;Hawkins&quot; under the command of Cmdr. Alfred L. Cope, played a significant role in rescue operations off Chilang Point Hong Kong 19 July 1947, when the steamer sank with over 2,000 passengers on board. She returned to the United States 8 October 1947.

After a year of operations out of San Diego the ship sailed again for the Far East, arriving at Tsingtao, China on 29 October. Following operations off the Chinese coast &quot;Hawkins&quot; got underway from Tsingtao on 6 December. On this long voyage, completing a circuit of the globe, the destroyer visited Ceylon, Turkey, Gibraltar, New York City, and Panama before arriving San Diego 10 March 1949.
&quot;Hawkins&quot; was reassigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet soon afterward, arriving at her new home port, Newport, Rhode Island on 23 May 1949. For the next year she took part in Reserve training cruises and readiness exercises in the Caribbean. The ship had been reclassified DDR-873 on 18 March 1949. &quot;Hawkins&quot; departed on 2 May 1950 for a cruise with 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.

====Korean War====

While in the Mediterranean, the world became aware of the Communist invasion of South Korea. After NATO maneuvers, &quot;Hawkins&quot; returned to Newport 10 October and prepared to become part of the fleet sailing for what became known as the Korean War. Sailing on 3 January via the Panama Canal she arrived at Pusan on 5 February. During her four months of Korean duty, &quot;Hawkins&quot; screened the mobile aircraft carrier forces during strikes on enemy positions and supply lines, provided antisubmarine protection, and controlled jet aircraft in combat air patrols. She also acted as plane guard during operations in the Formosa Straits designed to discourage Communist aggression against the friendly island. Departing the Far East in June, the destroyer returned to Newport on 8 August via the Mediterranean.

==== Suez Crisis ====
For the next few years the veteran ship alternated picket duty and training operations in the western Atlantic with periodic cruises to the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet. She was in the Eastern Mediterranean during the summer of 1950 when the Suez crisis threatened the security and peace of the area. &quot;Hawkins&quot; arrived at Mayport, Florida, her new homeport, on 18 August 1960. She became part of DESRON-8 performing exercises in the Bahamas and Caribbean areas with one deployment of radar picket duty off the coast of Nicaragua returning to Mayport in December 1960. In January 1961 the destroyer soon resumed her pattern of cruises to the Mediterranean.

==== Cuban Missile Crisis ====
In 1961 she operated with a special Task Group in connection with American space experiments and missile tests off Cape Canaveral, Florida. When the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba in 1962 threatened the security of the United States, &quot;Hawkins&quot; joined with other ships in quarantining that Caribbean country, cruising the Caribbean from late October until December. In 1963 the ship returned to the Mediterranean in January returning to Mayport in July and in August took part in Polaris missile tests in the Caribbean with the submarine . During the next 5 months, &quot;Hawkins&quot; operated with aircraft carriers off Florida and in the Caribbean. Following additional Polaris missile tests with in February 1964, the destroyer steamed to Boston 21 March and was placed in commission, in reserve, prior to undergoing a FRAM I overhaul.

==== Vietnam War ====

Reclassified DD-873 on 1 April, &quot;Hawkins&quot; completed FRAM late in 1964. Assigned to Destroyer Squadron 24, she operated out of Newport until departing 29 September for duty in the Far East. Steaming via the Panama Canal and the West Coast, she joined the 7th Fleet on 23 November. For the next three months she guarded aircraft carriers in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin and provided gunfire support for ground troops along the coast of South Vietnam. She departed Subic Bay late in February 1966, steamed via the Suez Canal, and arrived Newport 8 April.

&quot;Hawkins&quot;, over the next few months, participated in naval exercises off the East Coast and in the Caribbean. Departing Newport on 28 November, she joined the 6th Fleet at Gibraltar 8 December and became flagship for ComDesRon 24. For more than three months she cruised the Mediterranean from Spain to Greece before returning to Newport 20 March 1967. Into mid-1967 she operated along the Atlantic Coast from New England to Florida.

&quot;Hawkins&quot; went into the Boston Naval Shipyard in 1967 for overhaul. After months in the shipyard and in dry dock, the ship went to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a shakedown cruise.

On 11 February 1969, &quot;Hawkins&quot; was operating off the coast of Cuba with the submarine when &quot;Chopper&quot; had a near-fatal accident. The submarine managed to surface but &quot;Chopper&quot; shot through the surface of the ocean, nearly vertical. The entire forward section of the submarine, to the aft edge of the sail, cleared the surface before she fell back.

In July 1969, &quot;Hawkins&quot;, working out of Cape Canaveral, Florida began Polaris missile tests with the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarine , which ended with a successful test firing of a missile down a test range. Immediately afterward, these same tests were made with the submarine but in this case the test was aborted shortly after launch.

&quot;Hawkins&quot; took part in the United States space project in November 1969 when it was assigned to the Apollo 12 Atlantic Recovery Force. The ship was fitted with special capsule recovery gear and practiced along with a Navy Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) to be prepared to recover the space capsule in the Atlantic if the Pacific landing was aborted.

In December 1969, &quot;Hawkins&quot; changed homeport from Newport, Rhode Island, to Norfolk, Virginia.

In 1970, the United States Navy assigned the destroyer to the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic for &quot;Exercise Atlantic Ice&quot;. &quot;Steinaker&quot; ran aground while doing maneuvers in a fjord near Harstad, traveling at and was removed from the exercise. &quot;Hawkins&quot; was directed to replace &quot;Steinaker&quot; and complete their assignment with NATO. &quot;Hawkins&quot; met &quot;Steinaker&quot; in Bergen, Norway to offload their munitions, allowing them to enter the repair facility at Haakonsvern. From Bergen, &quot;Hawkins&quot; traveled to Oslo with exercises above the Arctic Circle en route. After more exercise in the North Sea, the force stopped in Kiel and then proceeded to Copenhagen in mid-May. There was a show of flags in Antwerp and Plymouth. Leaving Plymouth at the end of May, the force exercised with a French submarine in the Bay of Biscay before going to Lisbon.

==== Apollo 14 ====
On 9 February 1971, &quot;Hawkins&quot; again participated in the space program as a backup recovery ship in the Atlantic for Apollo 14.

In the spring of 1977, the USS Hawkins DD-873 was deployed to the US Sixth Fleet, where she served both with a CVBG and independently until October when she returned to Norfolk and began the transition to the Naval Reserve Fleet.

From 1977 to 1979, the &quot;Hawkins&quot; was assigned as a Naval Reserve training ship in Philadelphia. By that time she was nearing the end of her designed lifespan. Science fiction writer James D. Macdonald, then an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve, was assigned to her during this period, and reported to the captain one morning that the sounding tape used to check the water level in the ship&#x27;s tanks had punched through the striking plate in one of the sounding tubes and the hull plate beyond it, indicating the hull was becoming unsound.

The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 1 October 1979 and sold to the Taiwan in 1983.

===Service in the Republic of China Navy===

The ship was commissioned on 9 July 1983 and renamed &quot;Shao Yang&quot; or &quot;Tze Yang&quot; (DD-930) after repairs were completed.

During Exercise Han Kuang in 1989, she successfully launched the RUR-5 ASROC and torpedoes.

The ship was scrapped in the late 1990s, but part of her superstructure is on display and training ground in the Zuoying Naval Academy, Kaohsiung City. Another one of her 5-inch gun is on static display at the Kaohsiung Harbor, YM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung.

==Awards==
&quot;Hawkins&quot; received two battle stars for Korean War service.

<text>Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) was a 2G mobile telecommunications standard used exclusively in Japan.

After a peak of nearly 80 million subscribers to PDC, it had 46 million subscribers in December 2005, and was slowly phased out in favor of 3G technologies like W-CDMA and CDMA2000. At the end of March 2012, the count had dwindled down to almost 200,000 subscribers. NTT Docomo shut down their network, mova, on April 1, 2012 at midnight.

==Technical overview==
Like D-AMPS and GSM, PDC uses TDMA. The standard was defined by the RCR (later became ARIB) in April 1991, and NTT DoCoMo launched its Digital mova service in March 1993. PDC uses 25 kHz carrier, pi/4-DQPSK modulation with 3-timeslot 11.2 kbit/s (full-rate) or 6-timeslot 5.6 kbit/s (half-rate) voice codecs.

PDC is implemented in the 800 MHz (downlink 810–888 MHz, uplink 893–958 MHz), and 1.5 GHz (downlink 1477–1501 MHz, uplink 1429–1453 MHz) bands. The air interface is defined in RCR STD-27 and the core network MAP by JJ-70.10. NEC, Motorola, and Ericsson are the major network equipment manufacturers.

The services include voice (full and half-rate), supplementary services (call waiting, voice mail, three-way calling, call forwarding, and so on), data service (up to 9.6 kbit/s CSD), and packet-switched wireless data (up to 28.8 kbit/s PDC-P). Voice codecs are PDC-EFR and PDC-HR.

Compared to GSM, PDC&#x27;s weak broadcast strength allows small, portable phones with light batteries at the expense of substandard voice quality and problems maintaining the connection, particularly in enclosed spaces like elevators.

===PDC-EFR===
PDC Enhanced Full Rate is a speech coding standard that was developed by ARIB in Japan and used in PDC mobile networks in Japan. The carriers use one of those codecs as PDC-EFR: CS-ACELP 8 kbit/s (a.k.a. NTT DoCoMo Hypertalk) and ACELP 6.7 kbit/s (a.k.a. J-PHONE Crystal Voice).

The PDC-EFR CS-ACELP uses G.729. The PDC-EFR ACELP is compatible with the AMR mode AMR_6.70.

===PDC-HR===
PDC Half Rate is a speech coding standard that was developed by ARIB in Japan and used in PDC mobile networks in Japan. It operates with a bit-rate of 3.45 kbit/s and is based on Pitch Synchronous Innovation CELP (PSI-CELP).

<text>USS &quot;Duncan&quot; (DD-874) was a of the United States Navy, the third named for Captain Silas Duncan USN (1788–1834). The ship was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 22 May 1944, launched on 27 October 1944 by Mrs. D. C. Thayer and commissioned on 25 February 1945. The ship was sunk in 1980.

==Service history==
&quot;Duncan&quot;, converted to a radar picket destroyer during her post-shakedown overhaul, sailed from Norfolk on 2 June 1945 for the Pacific, and after touching down at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, joined for screening and plane guard duty during the strikes on Wake Island of 1 August. After calling at Eniwetok, she continued to Okinawa to join the 7th Fleet for patrol duty off the Chinese and Korean coasts during the landing of occupation troops at Tsingtao, Taku, and Incheon. &quot;Duncan&quot; served in the Far East on occupation duty until 25 March 1946 when she sailed for the west coast, arriving at San Diego on 28 April.

For the next year &quot;Duncan&quot; trained along the west coast, keeping high her operational skills and readiness. In May 1947 she departed San Diego for a five-month cruise to the Far East, where she visited Okinawa, Japan, and China. On her return to the States, &quot;Duncan&quot; resumed coastal operations with both aircraft and submarines. On 1 March 1948 she suffered 2 killed and 14 injured in an explosion on board. She &quot;suffered considerable damage at the stern and the flooding of the after compartment from a hole at the water line.&quot; After repairs at Long Beach, California, the destroyer rejoined the fleet for training until January 1949, when she again sailed for the western Pacific, this time for eight months. &quot;Duncan&quot; was reclassified DDR-874 on 18 March 1949.

&quot;Duncan&quot; operated between San Diego and Pearl Harbor until November 1950 when she steamed into Korean waters to join the 7th Fleet. &quot;Duncan&quot; served a total of three tours off Korea during the fighting. She sailed as plane guard for carriers and as anti-submarine escort for battleships; she fired shore bombardments in support of minesweepers and to interdict enemy communications; she patrolled against North Korean minesweepers and fishing craft. Through all she added her significant contribution to the vast sea-borne support of the United Nations troops ashore.

After the end of the Korean fighting in 1953, &quot;Duncan&quot; remained busy in the Pacific, alternating Far Eastern duty with training and maintenance on the west coast. She visited Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many islands of the Pacific. During 1960–1961 &quot;Duncan&quot; entered the FRAM program, and underwent extensive overhaul and modernization at Long Beach Naval Shipyard.

During the Vietnam War &quot;Duncan&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin, participated in Operations &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; and &quot;Market Time&quot;, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions.

&quot;Duncan&quot; was decommissioned on 15 January 1971, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1974, and sunk as a target off California on 31 July 1980. 
==Awards==
&quot;Duncan&quot; received seven battle stars for Korean War service.

<text>John Carr Munro (16 March 193119 August 2003) was a Canadian politician. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 election, and served continuously as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Hamilton, Ontario in the electoral riding of Hamilton East until his resignation in 1984, following his defeat for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada which was eventually won by John Turner.

==Career==
John Carr Munro was born in Hamilton, Ontario on March 16, 1931 to John Anderson Munro (1898-1952) and Katharine Alexandra Carr (1902-1979). He was the grandson of Dr. Leeming George Carr, physician and politician, and Katharine Anderson, author.

After receiving a B.A. from the University of Western Ontario and an LL.B. from Osgoode Hall, Munro entered politics as an alderman for Hamilton, Ontario City Council in 1954. Munro was called to the bar in 1956.

Munro was first elected to the House of Commons in 1962, representing the riding of Hamilton East. From 1963 to 68, Munro served as Parliamentary Secretary to a number of ministers in Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s government, including the Ministers of Manpower and Immigration, Trade and Commerce, and National Health and Welfare.

Munro was appointed to Cabinet by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and served variously as Minister of Amateur Sport, Minister of Health and Welfare and Minister of Labour from 1968 to 1978. Munro worked closely with Lou Lefaive as the director of the Directorate of Fitness and Amateur Sport to develop the government&#x27;s policies on sport.

He returned to cabinet when Trudeau returned to power in the 1980 federal election and served as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development throughout Trudeau&#x27;s final term.

On June 21, 1981, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; ran a front-page story accusing Munro of profiting from illegal insider trading through his advance knowledge of Petro-Canada&#x27;s bid to acquire Petrofina Canada. Munro sued the paper, its editors, and the two reporters for libel. There no evidence that the stock transaction described in the &quot;Sun&quot; had ever taken place, and the corporation through which the deals were said to have been made never actually existed. Even with the &quot;Sun&quot;&#x27;s retraction and apology, the paper was ordered to pay Munro $75,000, then a very high award for a libel case in Canada.

On June 27, 1978, Munro married future David Peterson Cabinet Minister Lilly Oddie, who took his surname. The couple would later divorce after his career, when Oddie returned to using her original name.

Munro ran at the 1984 Liberal leadership convention coming in sixth. Munro attempted to return to Parliament in the 1988 general election in the riding of Lincoln but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Shirley Martin. He again attempted to win the Liberal nomination in the riding of Lincoln in the 1993 general election, but the nomination eventually went to Tony Valeri after an acrimonious fight between Munro and the Liberal Party national office.

His leadership campaign led to trouble when Munro and his associates were investigated under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and faced 37 charges alleging illegal kickbacks to his 1984 leadership campaign and other irregularities. The charges were thrown out in 1991. He sued the federal government in 1992 for compensation over being wrongfully charged. The case dragged on for seven years until the government agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $1.4 million, of which $1.2 million went to Munro&#x27;s lawyers and other creditors.

In 2000, he ran for Mayor of Hamilton, finishing in fourth place with nearly 10 percent of the popular vote.

He died on August 19, 2003.

==Legacy==
Munro was the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs who, in November 1982, announced the federal government&#x27;s conditional approval of the creation of the Nunavut territory, setting off the official chain of events that culminated in the division of the Northwest Territories and the establishment of the new Arctic territory in 1999.

Hamilton&#x27;s John C. Munro International Airport is named after him.

Following Munro&#x27;s death, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said he was &quot;a very good man. He was a very good Member of Parliament and he was a very good minister and a guy who worked very, very hard (on) all the files that (were) given to him. He was a...grassroots politician, very socially oriented and a very effective minister.&quot;

<text>The second USS &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; (DD-875) was a of the United States Navy.

==Namesake==
Henry Warren Tucker was born on 5 October 1919 in Birmingham, Alabama. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 24 June 1941 and, after being trained as a pharmacist″s mate, reported to the oiler on 15 January 1942.

On 7 May 1942, in the opening phase of the Battle of the Coral Sea, &quot;Neosho&quot; and its escorting destroyer, , were attacked by three waves of Imperial Japanese Navy planes after the Japanese mistook &quot;Neosho&quot; for an aircraft carrier and &quot;Sims&quot; for an escorting cruiser. &quot;Sims&quot; was sunk and &quot;Neosho&quot; so severely damaged that her commanding officer ordered all hands to prepare to abandon ship. Many of &quot;Neosho&quot;″s crew, believing in error that &quot;abandon ship&quot; orders had actually been given, went over the side at once. As the men struggled through the water trying to reach the few undamaged life rafts, Tucker swam among them, treating the burned and wounded. Disregarding his own safety, he helped many of his shipmates to safety on the life rafts while refusing a place himself, at the cost of his life. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

The destroyer escort USS &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; (DE-377) was named for him but its construction was cancelled in 1944 prior to completion.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 29 May 1944 and launched on 8 November 1944 by Mrs. Henry Walton Tucker, the mother of the late Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Third Class Henry W. Tucker. The ship was commissioned on 12 March 1945.

=== Service in the United States Navy ===

==== 1945-1963 ====
After shakedown, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; was converted to a radar picket destroyer and participated in radar and antiaircraft exercises off the Maine coast until sailing for Pearl Harbor 4 November. From the Hawaiian Islands she continued to Yokosuka, arriving 22 December, to aid in the occupation of Japan and repatriation of Japanese nationals. Her first tour of duty in the Far East ended 25 March 1946 as she set course for her new homeport, San Diego. In the next 3 years &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; made two more such cruises, alternating them with tactical exercises and operations along the east coast. In March and April 1948 the destroyer patrolled off Eniwetok in connection with United States atomic tests in the Pacific islands. She was reclassified DDR-875 18 March 1949.

Undergoing overhaul at the time North Korean troops launched their attack on South Korea in June 1950, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; speeded up preparations and joined the fleet operating off Korea in November. After five months of hunter-killer and patrol operations, she joined the screen for Task Force 77, a fast carrier force whose jets struck hard and often at enemy supply lines and troop concentrations. The destroyer also participated in shore bombardment and landed several raiding and intelligence parties on the western coast of the war-torn peninsula. On 28 June 1951 as she steamed into Wonsan harbour, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; was hit by six enemy shells. Two men were injured and extensive damage was done to her radar gear, but the destroyer&#x27;s return fire effectively silenced enemy shore batteries. Returning to San Diego 8 August, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; engaged in intensive training exercises before returning to Korea to join Task Force 77 off the east coast 25 March 1952. Screening and plane guard duty with the fast carrier force alternated with ASW patrol and shore bombardment duties until she sailed for home 13 September.

&quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for installation of the newest radar equipment in September, emerging 14 April 1953. Her new duties, centered primarily on the detection of enemy attack through extensive radar coverage, were to take her on eight more Western Pacific cruises in the next 10 years. In addition to the lonely patrols along the radar picket line, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; also patrolled the important Formosa Straits and the Korean coast. When not deployed with the 7th Fleet, the radar picket destroyer participated in tactical training exercises and fleet maneuvers out of her San Diego homeport. Streaming her homeward bound pennant at Yokosuka 2 November 1962, Henry W. Tucker sailed for Boston via Pearl Harbor, San Diego, Acapulco, and the Panama Canal.

==== 1963-1973 ====
She underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard in Boston, Massachusetts, between 13 December 1962 and 4 December 1963, designed to lengthen her life as an active member of the fleet by 10 to 15 years. While undergoing modernization, she was reclassified DD-875 on 15 March 1963. Following the FRAM overhaul, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; began a program of intensive training, until 26 May, when she departed for the western Pacific and a station on the Taiwan Patrol. Almost immediately she was diverted to the South China Sea.

Tucker alternated between antisubmarine patrol off Vietnam and off Taiwan until April 1965, when she joined Operation Market Time, a close surveillance of Vietnamese coastal traffic to prevent the shipment of supplies to the Viet Cong on the South Vietnamese coast. On 16 May the destroyer pounded Viet Cong coastal concentrations southeast of Saigon and thus became the first U.S. ship to provide naval gunfire support against enemy targets in South Vietnam. During the Vietnam War &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Operation Sea Dragon and Operation Market Time, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions.

&quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; provided gunfire support for ground operations dozens of times; and during a 40-day period in August and September fired over 5,000 rounds from her 12.7 cm guns, destroying or damaging numerous enemy positions. In addition to Market Time patrols, she screened hardhitting attack carriers in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin and served as a search and rescue control ship to recover downed pilots at sea. This vital duty sent her close to enemy-controlled shores; however, joined by daring CSAR helicopters which refueled and replenished from the destroyer while in flight, she provided maximum protection for planes returning from strikes over North Vietnam. She refueled more than 80 helicopters while on SAR assignments. Known as &quot;Tuck&#x27;s Tavern&quot; to the helicopter pilots, she became the first destroyer on 6 November to refuel an in-flight helicopter at night. Coordinated training with these versatile aircraft paid off 26 June 1966 when two pilots from and were rescued from the sea less than from the North Vietnamese coast and carried to &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot;.

After more than 2 years of almost continuous duty off Vietnam, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; returned to Long Beach early in August 1966. Following a 4-month overhaul and intensive training out of San Diego and Long Beach, she deployed to the Far East in June 1967. She resumed carrier screening duty late in July; and, following the disastrous fire on board on 29 July, she took part in survivor rescue and escort operations.

From 1968 to July 1970, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; was forward deployed to Yokosuka Naval Base as part of Destroyer Division 32, U.S. Seventh Fleet. During this period, the ship conducted numerous missions in support of U.S. and allied forces in Vietnam including II Corps naval gunfire support, Gulf of Tonkin carrier operations and search and rescue operations. During the 1970 Cambodian Incursion by U.S. and ARVN forces, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; took up station in the Gulf of Thailand to blockade the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville to prevent supplies arriving by sea to aid the NVA forces. While in port at Yokosuka on 14 April 1970, the crew was ordered to return to the ship and prepare to sail as part of the Apollo 13 emergency recovery team. The order was canceled when the distance to the recovery area was deemed too far with return anticipated three days later.

&quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; was stationed at San Diego for the next 3 years but returned to WESTPAC on two more cruises prior to decommissioning. On Christmas Eve 1972, &quot;Henry W. Tucker&quot; and came under fire from a North Vietnamese shore battery. The ships returned fire and the battery was silenced. Both ships received the Combat Action Ribbon for the mission.

<text>John Moody Roberts, (November 28, 1933 – March 30, 2007) was a Canadian politician. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament for 13 years interspersed between 1968 and 1984. He was a member of cabinet in the government of Pierre Trudeau.

==Background==
Roberts was born in Hamilton, Ontario and grew up in Toronto, Ontario. He taught Political Science and Public Administration at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec and Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario. He was also a visiting fellow at Oxford University in the United Kingdom.

==Politics==
He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1968 as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of York—Simcoe. He was defeated in the 1972 federal election but returned in 1974. From 1974 to 1984 (defeated in 1979 and re-elected in 1980), he was MP for the riding of St. Paul&#x27;s in Toronto.

He was a junior cabinet minister in his role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion from 1971 to 1972. In 1976, he was appointed Secretary of State for Canada in Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet. Roberts lost his seat again in the 1979 election in which the Trudeau government was defeated.

He was returned to the House yet again as a result of the 1980 election, and joined Trudeau&#x27;s final cabinet, first as Minister of the Environment, Minister of State for Science and Technology and then as Minister of Employment and Immigration. As Canadian environment minister in the early 1980s he faced off with the US government over the cross-border issue of acid rain at a time when the Reagan Administration was denying its existence. Roberts led a strong public information campaign on both sides of the border that, at one point, resulted in the US justice department officially branding a National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Acid from Heaven&quot; as &quot;foreign country propaganda&quot;. The campaign is credited with ultimately leading to a bilateral accord on acid rain being signed later in the decade.

Roberts ran to succeed Trudeau at the 1984 Liberal leadership convention, coming in fourth behind John Turner. Turner kept Roberts in his cabinet as Minister of Employment and Immigration. Roberts and Turner&#x27;s government were defeated in the 1984 election. An attempt to return to parliament in 1988, this time from Ontario riding (Pickering), was unsuccessful.

==Later life==
After retiring from academic life he returned to Toronto, living near the area of Yorkville. Roberts led the Canadian delegation to the 1998 Lisbon World Exposition (Expo 98) in Portugal and which lasted from May 22 to September 30, 1998. He died of a heart attack in 2007.

<text>The Laramie River is a tributary of the North Platte River, approximately long, in the U.S. states of Colorado and Wyoming. The river was named for Jacques La Ramie, a fur trapper who visited the area in the early 19th century. Laramie County, Wyoming, the city of Laramie, and other geographical entities in the region have &quot;Laramie&quot; in their names.

==Course==
The river rises in northern Colorado, in the Roosevelt National Forest in the Front Range, in western Larimer County. It flows north-northwest into Wyoming, along the east side of the Medicine Bow Mountains, past Jelm and Woods Landing, then northeast emerging from the mountains southwest of Laramie. The river then flows north through Laramie. In the Laramie Plains it is joined by the Little Laramie River. The Laramie River then continues north through the Laramie Plains and through Wheatland Reservoir. It flows northeast through the Laramie Mountains. Emerging from the mountains, it receives the North Laramie River north of Wheatland and Chugwater Creek 7 mi (11 km) northeast of Wheatland. It joins the North Platte opposite the town Fort Laramie.

In its upper reaches in Colorado, the river supplies water to the Cache La Poudre River via the Laramie–Poudre Tunnel. The tunnel, which is approximately long, was finished in 1911 as part of a larger irrigation project for northern Colorado.

<doc id="543240" wikidata="Q1849072" url="?curid=543240" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1992">
<text>This is a list of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-ones of 1992. The longest running number-one single of 1992 is &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; by Whitney Houston, which stayed at the top of the chart for 14 weeks. &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; became the longest running song at number one when it reached 14 weeks, breaking the record that Boyz II Men&#x27;s &quot;End of the Road&quot; had just set at 13 weeks.

&quot;End of the Road&quot; broke the record previously set at 11 weeks by Elvis Presley in 1956 with &quot;Hound Dog&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; would hold the record as the longest-running song atop the Hot 100 until &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men topped the chart for 16 weeks in 1995.

Although &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; spent nine of its weeks atop the Hot 100 in 1993, it is considered the longest-running song of 1992 because that is when its run began.

A total of 12 songs topped the Hot 100, a record low since its debut in 1958. (Over 25 songs were number one each year from 1985 to 1991.) This is also the most recent year in which no artist had more than one song hit the No. 1 spot.

That year, 7 acts earned their first number one song: Right Said Fred, Mr. Big, Vanessa Williams, Kris Kross, Sir Mix-a-Lot, Boyz II Men, and The Heights.

<text>Women in Cuba have the same constitutional rights as men in the economic, political, cultural and social fields, as well as in the family. Cuba is regarded as a regional front-runner in women&#x27;s rights. According to Article 44 of the Cuban Constitution, &quot;The state guarantees women the same opportunities and possibilities as men in order to achieve woman’s full participation in the development of the country.&quot; As of 2015, women hold 48.9% of the parliamentary seats in the Cuban National Assembly ranking sixth of 162 countries on issues of female participation in political life.

Many women in Cuba come from different racial backgrounds including Afro-Cuban women. Along with Afro-Cuban women, women in Cuba, formerly a marginalized group, were able to gain higher educational levels and equal advancements in their respective careers. The 1975 Family Code was designed to allow Cuban women to share the household duties fairly with their spouses. Job opportunities were available in the cities and as a result, many Cuban women left the countryside to work and live in the cities. However, because of the increased number of Cuban women studying and working, the national birth rate has declined. Despite the fact that desegregation was enforced in Cuba, there are still some issues in regards to fair housing in Cuba.

==History==
In the first half of the 20th century, women in Cuba had achieved a status comparable with that of other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Chile. The goal of Cuban feminists during this time was based on Cuban culture as well as the class position of the women who led the feminist movement. In 1923, the first National Women&#x27;s Congress was held in Havana. Thirty-one different women&#x27;s organizations participated in the Congress. Three years later in 1925, a second National Women&#x27;s Congress was held and this time seventy women&#x27;s organizations participated. During this time, one of the most prominent leaders among the feminist movement was Ofelia Domínguez Navarro, who also participated in both National Women&#x27;s Congresses. In 1933, during the 100-day government of Ramón Grau, Cuban women received the vote. In 1934 the percentages of Cuban women working outside the home, attending school, and practicing birth control surpassed the corresponding percentages in nearly every other Latin American country.

Women in Cuba had been elected to Cuba&#x27;s House of Representatives and Senate, serving as mayors, judges, cabinet members, municipal counselors, and members of the Cuban foreign service. The return of Grau to government, under the auspices of President Fulgencio Batista provided for the Cuban Constitution of 1940, one of the most progressive in the Western Hemisphere with regard to women&#x27;s status, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex and calling for equal pay for equal work. While these progressive laws were a step in the right direction, many of them were not enforced.

During the Cuban Revolution, women were mobilized and obtained unparalleled rights compared to the rest of Latin America. For example, they were able to obtain the 1975 Cuban Family Code. This code outlawed discrimination against women and girls, even within the family. The 1975 Family Code stated that both husband and wife share an equal amount of responsibilities in the household. According to the Federation of Cuban women, the Family Code is an educational example for young generations. By seeing the Family Code as an example for families, young people could note that both husband and wife are required to share household duties.

After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Federation of Cuban Women (FMC) was established as an NGO. The Federation of Cuban Women allowed for the Cuban government to closely monitor women&#x27;s progress and ensure oversight. This helped women to achieve &quot;impressive parity in university education, pay scales, and local government positions.&quot; The FMC was recognized by the Cuban government as &quot;the national mechanism for the advancement of women in Cuba&quot;. The organization claims to have more than 3 million members, which constitutes 85.2% of all women over age 14. There is also a Women&#x27;s Training Center and a Women&#x27;s Publishing House at the national level. The group generally adheres to the Cuban government&#x27;s objectives &quot;to defend the Cuban Revolution&quot;.

Since the &quot;Special Period in the Times of Peace&quot; in the 1990s, women have stepped to the forefront of life in Cuba, calling for a step towards an existence without sexism. Sexism in Cuba goes hand in hand with the racism experienced by Afro-Cubans. Black women receive the lowest paying jobs and have the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest education levels. They often live with the threat of gender violence.

Even though Cuban women achieved a lot of parity during the Cuban Revolution, there was still a lot of disparity prevalent in Cuban society.

Some examples are:

* &quot;During the 1990s, when subsidies from the Soviet Union ended, the maintenance of social services often fell back on women as mothers, wives, and caregivers, indicative that Cuba had not fully equalized gender responsibilities.&quot;
* Women only held one-quarter of high-level administrative positions in government.
* &quot;This persistence of women&#x27;s inequality in the political arena was apparent in the speculation over who was to succeed Fidel Castro as head of state, when he became ill in 2006. Of the 12-15 names mentioned, which included the inner circles of Cuba&#x27;s leadership, not one was a woman.&quot;

A referendum on the matter of modifying the Family Code was held in Cuba on 25 September 2022. It succeeded, and among other things the new Family Code includes strict equality of rights between men and women. Even before the passage of the Family Code, Cuba was already a regional front-runner in women&#x27;s rights according to Reuters.

==Hip-hop==
Hip hop, more specifically rap, has become the vehicle for Cuban women to express their dissatisfaction with race and gender status in Cuba. The lyrics of all female Cuban rap groups Krudas Cubensi and Obsession ask for respect for diversity on the music scene and sympathy for women who have turned to prostitution in Cuba for economic rescue. During the &quot;Special Period&quot;, women came to the forefront in managing different economic and domestic situations and in doing so, assumed more responsibility and new authority. The popular dance style &quot;perreo&quot; can be seen as a symbol of this change, with women in front of men during the dance.

Promotion of female hip-hop artists is currently not on the same level as their male counterparts. However, through the support of the Cuban Rap Agency and specifically Magia López, the head of the agency, this may change. López is currently working to increase the participation of women in the Cuban hip-hop scene.

==Reproductive health==
In modern Cuba, women have free access to abortion and up to two years maternity leave.

Before the success of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, abortion in Cuba was illegal and contraceptives inaccessible. Reproductive health laws were patterned after the 1870 Penal Code in Spain, making abortion highly restrictive. In 1936, some of the more restrictive laws were rewritten and put into the new penal code, called the Social Defense Code.

After the creation of the FMC in 1960, efforts were made to increase the reproductive rights of women in Cuba. In 1965, abortion was decriminalized and in 1979, abortion was made free and more easily accessible. The United Nations Population Policy data bank states that between 1968 and 1974, the rate of legal abortion went from 16.5 to 69.5 legal abortions performed per 1,000 women of reproductive age. Currently, the estimate is around 47 and 62 legal abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age.

The reason there is such a focus on abortion when discussing reproductive rights in Cuba is because it is very commonly used for family planning. However, other contraceptives are available for free through the Cuban healthcare system and are used. According to statistics gathered from UNICEF and the United Nations Population Division, it is estimated that contraceptive prevalence of any method (methods defined as modern methods of contraceptives, including female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, the intrauterine device (IUD), the male condom, injectables, implantable devices, vaginal barrier methods, the female condom and emergency contraception and not including abortion) was 73.7 percent of women in Cuba ages 15–49. The peak percentage was 77.8 in 2010 and lowest 60 percent in 1980.

==Home, family, and birth rate==
Women head nearly 50% of Cuban households.

One of the areas where women in Cuba continue to face inequality is within their own homes. Despite many women with children having advanced collegiate degrees and jobs in the professional workforce, they also have the responsibility to care for their children, husbands, and do most, if not all, of the cooking and cleaning for the household. Unequal distribution of household work can be at least partially attributed to the concept of Machismo often found in Latin American countries. In terms of relationships, women in Cuba were expected to have a fulfilling and satisfactory relationship with their husbands. By having a pleasing relationship with their husbands, the Cuban government theorized that the couples’ loving relationship will influence their children to behave morally and civilly. The rigid gender norms result in women cutting down work hours and receiving even less pay than they already are in order to make the time to care for their homes and families.

After the Cuban Revolution, more and more Cuban women started working away from home. The revolutionary government worked to change the societal norms marginalizing women in Cuba. Emancipation was necessary to help women gain equal economic opportunities. Prior to the Cuban Revolution, according to a census taken in 1953, 13.7% of Cuban women were working. After 1960, the number of women working increased. With revolutionary reforms that were implemented, Cuban women have more economic opportunities. A steady income would serve as an incentive for both men and women to migrate to the cities. However, with more women working and going to school, the birth rate has decreased. Another result is that there were fewer people living and working in the countryside due to the fact that they emigrated to the cities for jobs.

One consequence of the disproportionate household work burden is that many women are choosing to utilize Cuba&#x27;s aforementioned accessible abortions and contraceptives to delay, if not completely prevent, having any children. Cuba&#x27;s birth rate has been decreasing in recent years. In 2016, it was estimated that the country&#x27;s population growth rate was at 0.13% and it is believed it will continue to slow to a negative population growth within the next few years if current trends continue. Comparatively, the United States population growth rate was at 0.7% in 2016, in Canada 1.2% in 2016, and in Mexico a 1.3% growth rate in 2016. The world population growth rate in 2016 was about 1.1%.

In the housing industry in Cuba, there were inequalities in the housing sector. Despite the Revolution&#x27;s promise to implement equal distribution and fair housing, the revenues sent from abroad were able to sustain the Caucasian Cubans’ living expenses. Afro-Cuban men and women were not able to live in luxurious homes due to a finding that the majority of expensive homes were owned by Caucasian Cubans sustained by revenues sent from family members living abroad. Despite the high number of Caucasian owners in expensive neighborhoods, the Revolution has implemented desegregation in schools and in neighborhoods.

==Education==
Historically, Cuba was a largely agrarian society, with a tourism-based economy in the urban areas, primarily Havana. Many women were forced to work as maids or prostitutes in these areas because there were not many other choices for them, as they were excluded from educational opportunities. Before the revolution, around 70% of women in the workforce were domestic servants, working for long hours with low pay and little to no benefits. Only around 194,000 women were in the workforce, with around 700,000 considered unemployed and 300,000 underemployed.

After the revolution, the FMC fought to establish equal educational rights for women. The organization met with other Latin American countries to share ideas for positive increases in women&#x27;s education. The FMC started by establishing schools specifically for women who were domestic servants and prostitutes and schools for women living in poverty. These schools were designed to help women develop a broader range of skills, ultimately helping them to gain the ability to obtain higher education. These schools also set out to help with the country&#x27;s history of rates of illiteracy. About a quarter of the population of Cuba was illiterate when Fidel Castro took power and over half were women. By 1961, nearly the entire country was literate, primarily in thanks to volunteers (of which around 56% were young women) going to rural areas to teach literacy.

As of 2011, women in Cuba made up more than 80% of university students and around 68% of university graduates. Comparatively, women made up about 57% of undergraduates in the United States in 2008. Women in Cuba also make up about 81% of medical students, but are underrepresented in math and science fields, representing only 46% of natural science and math students, 37% of technical studies students, and 30% of engineering students.

==Women in the Cuban labor force==
Nearly 60% of professionals in modern Cuba are women.

Across the world, people are concerned about the feminization of poverty. Seven out of every ten poor people are women or girls, according to a study carried out by the World Food Program (WFP). In Cuba, we are seeing something unique in this area. While the average Cuban wage was around 494.4 regular pesos per month ($18.66) at the end of 2008 to 2015, an increase in the number of women in the technical and professional work force in Cuba has been seen. According to the World Bank’s Gender Data Portal, women represent 42% of the labor force participation rate in Cuba. Research conducted by the American Association of University Women (AAUW) showed that, in 2011, women represented around 70% of the professional workforce, 69% of health care workers, and 80% of educational workers, but only around 30% of engineers, showing that the rates decrease in the scientific and technical sector.

Before the Revolution there were little to no women in the workforce, let alone getting paid for the employment. Only 14.2 percent of the female population were in paid employment, according to a journal article, &quot;Socialism and Feminism: Women and the Cuban Revolution, Part 1&quot;. Most women in this time were expected to be housewives and attend to their husbands and families. Although, there was a small percentage of women that were seeking to work. According to the journal article, &quot;Socialism and Feminism: Women and the Cuban Revolution, Part 1&quot;, in 1958 there was a percentage of 19.3 women looking for jobs. Since then, compared to the statistics now you can see an increase in women in the work force. But you still see the difference between the men and women that are employed between the where they work and how much they&#x27;re getting paid. Therefore, there has been slight changes but there is still a lot more improvement and change to be done for the women of Cuba and receive the rights they deserve. 
== History of Afro-Cuban women ==
Afro-Cuban women have been living in Cuba starting in the fifteenth century with the rise of the demand for slaves during colonial times. Slaves born in Africa and were imported to Cuba were termed &quot;bozal&quot;. Slaves born in Cuba were known as &quot;negro criollo&quot;. The Afro-Cuban culture was also amalgamated with the influx of Afro-Haitians and their cultural products and practices in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution. 

After 1959, the revolutionary government instituted new reforms for the Afro-Cubans and the overall population. The revolutionary government had a goal to make every sector of the population become literate. The result was that many Afro-Cubans graduated from high school which is statistically higher compared to their white counterparts. This change would result in noting a substantial number of Afro-Cubans enrolling in medical schools. They were trained in medical schools established in Cuba. Medical schools were established since there was a &quot;brain drain&quot; that occurred likely due to the increasing attractiveness of the revolutionary ideals in the country. Thereof, one of the changes include free medical care which was provided to the Cuban population as well as to foreign patients. Cuba was renowned for its humanitarian cause in other countries including Venezuela. Afro-Cuban women were the majority of doctors sent abroad. One of the reasons why many Afro-Cuban women make up the majority of doctors sent abroad is because the salary is lucrative. Many Afro-Cubans did not have families living abroad and so they were not able to receive currency nor gifts. The Cuban government did not charge tuition to students and Afro-Cuban women and Cuban women were able to study in medical schools. They gained the opportunity to be high-paying doctors and this is a major gain in women&#x27;s rights in Cuba. By receiving steady money and material commodities such as clothing, the Afro-Cuban doctors were able to support their families in Cuba. In addition, they would not have an obligation to immigrate to a new country. They could work in a foreign country for a relatively short period of time then return home to Cuba.

During the Special Period, Afro-Cubans were severely affected by the numerous problems that arose. For instance, they had to endure hardships including low supply of food and insufficient job opportunities. Afro-Cuban women asserted that they did not receive the professional opportunity to contribute to the Cuban economy despite their high educational level. For instance, in the 1990s, Afro-Cuban women have raised the issue of lack of jobs in the tourist sector. Because of the hardships, insufficient food supply, and insufficient hospitality jobs, many women including Afro-Cubans turned to sex work and international dating (tourism). In the sex tourism industry, Afro-Cuban female sex workers became publicly associated as some distinct and vixenish type of exotic objects. Conversely, Caucasian-Cuban sex workers were commonly assumed to be girlfriends or wives for tourists.

==Prominent women in Cuba after the revolution ==
The most prominent woman in the Cuban government after the revolution was Vilma Espín. Vilma Espín was the wife of Raúl Castro. She was the founder of the Federation of Cuban Women, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the party&#x27;s Political Bureau. She had a chemical engineering degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was a leader in the guerrilla movement during the revolution and was extremely close with Fidel and Raúl Castro.

On the other side, a prominent figure was opposition leader Laura Inés Pollán Toledo. Pollán founded the dissident group Ladies in White, which holds pacifist protest marches with the wives and spouses of political prisoners in Cuba to demand their release. Pollan worked as a literature teacher until her retirement in 2004. She always wore white, a symbol of the organization, and became a key opposition figure in Cuba.

After the Revolution, many Afro-Cuban women, with financial support from the Cuban government, have graduated from medical schools and were sent abroad to help patients.

<doc id="543245" wikidata="Q1549546" url="?curid=543245" title="Human rights in Saudi Arabia">
<text>Human rights in Saudi Arabia are a topic of concern and controversy. Known for its executions of political protesters and opponents, the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been accused of and denounced by various international organizations and governments for violating human rights within the country. An absolute monarchy under the House of Saud, the government is consistently ranked among the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; in Freedom House&#x27;s annual survey of political and civil rights and was in 2023 ranked as the world&#x27;s most authoritarian regime.

The regime works to whitewash its record of human rights abuses. For example, it has for more than a decade employed the public relations organization Qorvis MSLGroup, a U.S. subsidiary of Publicis Groupe.

== Background ==
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy in which all legislative, executive, and judiciary power ultimately rests in the hands of the king, who is both head of state and head of government. The 1992 Basic Law sets out the system of governance, rights of citizens, and powers and duties of the government, and it provides that the Quran and Sunnah (the traditions of Muhammad) serve as the country&#x27;s constitution.

== Political freedom ==
The 1990s marked a slow period of political liberalization in the kingdom as the government created a written constitution, and the advisory &quot;Consultative Council&quot;, the latter being an appointed delegation of Saudi scholars and professionals that are allowed to advise the king. Some political dissidents were released from prison, after agreeing to disband their political parties. In 2005, adult male citizens were allowed to vote for some municipal seats, although plans for future elections, which may include adult women, have been put on hold indefinitely.

Political parties are banned, but some political dissidents were freed in the 1990s on the condition that they disband their political parties. Today, only the Green Party of Saudi Arabia remains, although it is an illegal organization. Trade unions are also banned, but the government has granted permission for Saudi citizens to form some private societies, which are allowed to do some humanitarian work within the kingdom.

Public demonstrations or any public act of dissent are forbidden. In April 2011, during the 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests, the kingdom made it a crime to publish any criticism harming the reputation of government or religious leaders, or which harms the interests of the state.

According to Human Rights Watch annual report 2016, Saudi Arabia continued to prosecute pro-reform activists and dissidents. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s terrorism court sentenced Waleed Abu al-Khair, prominent activist, to 15 years. He was convicted on charges concerning his peaceful criticism of the human rights situation in his country. In July, authorities arrested Zuhair Kutbi, an activist, because of his discussion to a peaceful reform in media. In September 2015, all of banned –Saudi Civil Political Rights Association (ACPRA) founders were jailed.

===Political prisoners===
Dissidents have been detained as political prisoners in Saudi Arabia during the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and earlier. Protests and sit-ins calling for political prisoners to be released took place during the 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests in many cities throughout Saudi Arabia, with security forces firing live bullets in the air on 19 August 2012 at a protest at al-Ha&#x27;ir Prison. , recent estimates of the number of political prisoners in Mabahith prisons range from an estimate of zero by the Ministry of Interior to 30,000 by the UK-based Islamic Human Rights Commission and the BBC.

Allegedly Khashoggi was not the only dissident on Saudi&#x27;s list to be abducted. Another Saudi prince, Khaled bin Farhan al-Saud, living in exile in Germany, told &quot;The Independent&quot; that a similar kidnapping was planned against him by the Saudi authorities 10 days prior. &quot;Over 30 times the Saudi authorities have told me to meet them in the Saudi embassy but I have refused every time. I know what can happen if I go into the embassy. Around 10 days before Jamal went missing they asked my family to bring me to Cairo to give me a cheque. I refused,&quot; said Saud. Five other royals, grandsons of King Abdul-Aziz were detained, when they raised their voice about Khashoggi&#x27;s disappearance.

In August 2018, a prominent Saudi cleric, Ahmed al-Amari, was detained by the Saudi authorities over the allegations of being associated with scholar and Saudi royal family critic Safar al-Hawali. Amari was held in solitary confinement since then. In January 2019, Amari died suffering a brain hemorrhage.

In November 2019, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that about eight citizens of Saudi Arabia were detained within two weeks for making critical comments against the kingdom. Rights groups have condemned the act by calling it an escalation of an ongoing crackdown on dissent.

On 2 September 2020, the family of Saad al-Jabri revealed that Saudi Arabia had arrested Salem Almuzaini, the son-in-law of Saad al-Jabri, who accused Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of sending a hit squad to Canada to kill him.

On 28 December 2020, the Criminal Court in Riyadh sentenced a prominent Saudi women&#x27;s rights activist to nearly two years in prison, drawing renewed attention to the kingdom&#x27;s human rights abuses.

On 8 June 2021 Saudi court sentenced a Sudanese media personality and journalist, Ahmad Ali Abdelkader, 31, to four years in prison. This ruling against him came forth since his tweets and media interviews openly discussed and expressed support for Sudan&#x27;s 2018-19 revolution, and criticized Saudi actions in Sudan and Yemen.

On 22 November 2021, Saudi authorities confirmed that they had detained Prince Salman (Ghazalan) Al Saud, and his father, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Muhammed, in an unofficial detention site without charges. The two men were arrested in January 2018 by a special Saudi security force, al-Saif al-Ajrab Brigade, as part of a broad purge of prominent royal family members, government officials, and influential business people, set up by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The father and son were disappeared in November 2020, and were held incommunicado until late October 2021. Abuses against the two men were documented, along with the conditions of their detention.

==Capital punishment==

The death penalty is permitted in Saudi Arabia for such crimes as rape, murder, apostasy, sedition, sorcery, armed robbery, adultery and drug trafficking. While some of these crimes, such as premeditated murder, carry fixed punishments under Sharia law, other crimes such as drug-related offenses, are considered tazir, with neither the crime nor the punishment defined in Islam. In 2005, there were 191 executions; in 2006, 38; in 2007, 153; and in 2008, 102. Executions are usually carried out by beheading, although firing squads are sometimes used; Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where beheading continues to be used as a method of execution.

A spokesman for the National Society for Human Rights, an organization which is funded by the Saudi monarchy, said that the number of executions is rising because crime rates are rising, that prisoners are treated humanely, and that the beheadings deter crime, saying, &quot;Allah, our creator, knows best what&#x27;s good for His people...Should we just think of and preserve the rights of the murderer and not think of the rights of others?&quot;

Saudi Arabian police and immigration authorities routinely abuse people who are stopped or detained, especially workers from developing countries. Earlier in November 2013, the authorities received criticism for the way they have planned and handled the crackdown on illegal workers. Saudi authorities – in some cases with the help of citizens – rounded up many illegal workers and physically abused them.

On 23 April 2019, Saudi Arabia carried out mass executions of 37 imprisoned civilians who had been convicted mostly on the basis of confessions obtained under torture or written by the accused&#x27;s torturers. Most of the executed belonged to the country&#x27;s Shia minority.

In April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court announced under a royal decree by King Salman that minors who commit crimes will no longer face the death sentence, but will be sentenced up to 10 years imprisonment in a juvenile detention facility.

In November 2021, sixteen British MPs and peers urged foreign secretary Liz Truss to intervene and stop Saudi Arabia from sentencing the Saudi scholar Hassan al-Maliki to death. Al-Maliki has been behind bars since 2017 on multiple charges, including &quot;conducting interviews with western news outlets&quot; and &quot;owning books&quot; that are unauthorised by the Saudi government. He was held incommunicado and in solitary confinement for three months. Labour MP Andy Slaughter said the treatment of the prominent academic was &quot;totally incompatible with the reforms espoused by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.&quot;

In November 2022, human rights organizations said Saudi Arabia resumed secret executions for drug offences. In 2018, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had vowed to &quot;minimise&quot; capital punishment. The regime had said that only those found guilty of a murder or of manslaughter will be sentenced to death. However, November 2022 reports revealed that the authorities executed 17 people in 10 days over non-violent drug charges. It included seven Saudis, four Syrians, three Pakistanis and three Jordanians. The executions majorly including beheading with a sword, bringing the total executions of 2022 to at least 137. It exceeded the combined number of executions of 2020 and 2021. The UN was not sure how many more people were on a death row. However, the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights (ESOHR) said nearly 54 more people, including eight minors, were on death row.

== Corporal punishment ==
One of about 30 countries in the world with judicial corporal punishment, Saudi Arabia permits amputations of hands and feet for robbery, and flogging was permitted until 2020 for lesser crimes such as &quot;sexual deviance&quot; and drunkenness. The number of lashes is not clearly prescribed by law and is varied according to the discretion of judges, and ranges from dozens of lashes to several hundred, usually applied over a period of weeks or months. At least five defendants were sentenced to flogging of 1,000 to 2,500 lashes. In the 2000s, it was reported that women were sentenced to lashes for adultery; the women were actually victims of rape, but because they could not prove who the perpetrators were, they were deemed guilty of committing adultery. In 2004, the United Nations Committee Against Torture criticized Saudi Arabia for such amputations and floggings; the Saudi delegation decried this &quot;interference&quot; in its legal system and defended 1,400-year-old &quot;legal traditions&quot; held since the inception of Islam. In 2009, Mazen Abdul-Jawad was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and five years in prison for bragging on a Saudi TV show about his sexual exploits.

In 2014, Saudi blogger Raif Badawi&#x27;s sentence was increased to 1,000 lashes and ten years&#x27; imprisonment after he was accused of apostasy in 2012. The lashes were due to take place over 20 weeks. The first round (50) were administered on 9 January 2015, but the second round has been postponed due to medical problems. The case was internationally condemned and put a considerable amount of pressure on the Saudi legal system.

In October 2015, UK pensioner and cancer victim Karl Andree, then 74, faced 360 lashes for home brewing alcohol. His family feared the punishment could kill him. However, he was released and returned home in November that year.

In 2016, a Saudi man was sentenced to 2,000 lashes, ten years in prison and a fine of 20,000 riyals (US$5,300) for making tweets critical of Islam, and denying the existence of God.

In September 2018, the official Twitter account of the Saudi Arabia prosecutors warned that people who share anything satirical on social media that &quot;affects public order, religious values and public morals&quot; would receive a five-year prison term and a fine of 3 million riyals (US$800,000). Several few intellectuals, businessmen and activists were arrested on such charges.

In April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court abolished the flogging punishment from its system and replaced it with jail time and fines.

==Torture==
While Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Criminal Procedure Code prohibits &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;undignified treatment&quot; (art. 2), in practice, torture and using torture to extract forced confessions of guilt remains common.

According to Amnesty International, security forces continued to torture and ill-treat detainees to extract confessions to be used as evidence against them at trial. According to the organization, 32 defendants accused of spying for Iran were subjected to torture and forced to confess. Detainees were held incommunicado and denied access to their families.

In 2018, a UN panel that visited Saudi Arabia on the kingdom&#x27;s invitation to conduct an inspection, revealed that the country has been systematically using anti-terror laws to justify torture. The report found that Saudis, who have been exercising their right to freedom of expression peacefully and calmly in the kingdom, have been systematically persecuted by the authorities.

Walid Fitaihi, a physician born in Jeddah in 1964, returned to Saudi Arabia in 2006 after studying and working in the US for two decades. He was arrested at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in November 2017 and moved to Al-Ha&#x27;ir Prison south of the capital. The Ritz-Carlton was used to hold many of the prominent prisoners of the Saudi government in 2017, according to Saudi activists. Al Jazeera reported, Fitaihi told a friend that he was &quot;blindfolded, stripped of his underwear and bound to a chair&quot;. The daily report also said that the Saudi government tortured him with electric shocks, &quot;what appears to have been a single session of torture that lasted about an hour&quot;. Reports also said he was whipped so severely that he could not sleep on his back for days.

In August 2019, a news article released in &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that more than 100 female migrants of Bangladeshi descent and some 45 male migrants fled from Saudi Arabia following psychological and sexual harassment from employers.

On 19 November 2020, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported human rights violations endured by women&#x27;s rights activists and political prisoners in Saudi Arabian jails, based on a report by the Grant Liberty organization. Reportedly, women&#x27;s rights activists and political prisoners have been sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed in Saudi Arabian detention cells. According to the research, 20 prisoners were arrested for political crimes, five of whom had already been put to death, while the remaining 13 face the death penalty. The report was released days before Saudi Arabia hosted the 2020 G20 Summit, which had female empowerment prominently on its agenda.

== Freedom of press and communication ==
According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi Arabia continued to repress pro-reform activists and peaceful dissidents in 2017.

Speech, the press and other forms of communicative media, including television and radio broadcasting and Internet reception, are actively censored by the government to prevent political dissent and anything deemed, by the government, to be offensive to Wahhabi culture or Islamic morality.

In 2008, a prominent Saudi blogger and reformist, Fouad al-Farhan, was jailed for posting comments online that were critical of Saudi business, religious and media figures, signifying a move by the government to step up its censorship of the Internet within its borders. He was released on 26 April 2008.

Online social media has increasingly come under government scrutiny for dealing with the &quot;forbidden&quot; topics. In 2010 a Saudi man was fined and given jail time for his sexually suggestive YouTube video production. That same year another man was also jailed and ordered to pay a fine for boasting about his sex life on television.

&quot;D+Z&quot;, a magazine focused on development, reports that hundreds were arrested in order to limit freedom of expression. Many of these individuals were held without trial and in secret. The torture of these prisoners was also found to be prevalent.

On 17 December 2012, blogger Raif Badawi was charged with apostasy, which carries the death penalty. Badawi is the editor and of co-founder of Free Saudi Liberals, a website for religious discussion. The organization Human Rights Watch has called for charges against him to be dropped. He had been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for &quot;insulting Islam&quot;, but this sentence was changed to 1,000 lashes, 10 years in prison, and additionally a fine of 1,000,000 Saudi riyals. The lashes are due to be administered every Friday for 20 weeks, 50 lashes at a time, but have not continued past the first flogging. The second flogging has been postponed more than twelve times; previous postponements were for health reasons, but the reason behind the most recent postponement is unknown.

Saudi novelist and political analyst Turki al-Hamad was arrested 24 December 2012 after a series of tweets on religion and other topics. The arrest was ordered by Saudi Interior Minister Prince Muhammad bin Nayef; however the charges against al-Hamad were not announced. He has since been freed.

In 2014 and 2015, a team of Saudi agents allegedly infiltrated Twitter and stole proprietary and sensitive personal data from the American social media platform, in order to unmask anonymous dissidents of Saudi Arabia.
In July 2015, Waleed Abulkhair, a prominent human rights lawyer, founder of Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi Arabia and recipient of 2012 of the Palm prize for human rights, was sentenced to 15 years of prison by a special criminal court in Riyadh for vague offences such as &quot;setting up an unlicensed organization&quot;.

On 17 November 2015, Ashraf Fayadh, a Palestinian poet and contemporary artist, was sentenced to death for committing apostasy. Fayadh was detained by the country&#x27;s religious police in 2013 in Abha, in southwest Saudi Arabia, and then rearrested and tried in early 2014. He was accused of having promoted atheism in his 2008 book of poems &quot;Instructions Within&quot;. However, the religious police failed to prove that his poetry was atheist propaganda and Fayadh&#x27;s supporters believe he is being punished by hardliners for posting a video online showing a man being lashed in public by the religious police in Abha. Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, said Fayadh&#x27;s death sentence showed Saudi Arabia&#x27;s &quot;complete intolerance of anyone who may not share government-mandated religious, political and social views&quot;.

On 15 July 2015, Saudi Arabian writer and commentator Zuhair Kutbi was sentenced to four years in prison without clear charges following an interview at the Rotana Khaleejia TV channel in which he discussed his ideas for peaceful reform in Saudi Arabia to become a constitutional monarchy, and talked about combatting religious and political repression. Kutbi&#x27;s lawyer and son said half the sentence was suspended, but that he was also banned from writing for 15 years and travelling abroad for 5 years, and fined US$26,600.

February 2017, Human Rights Watch issued a report regarding the violation of freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia. According to the report, since 2010, at least 20 prominent Saudi dissidents were sentenced to a long prison term or a travel ban for some years; the offenses ranged from breaking allegiance with the ruling family to participating in protests demanding rights be respected. According to the report, the government has been trying to silence people expressing dissenting views regarding religion, politics, and human rights. On 17 April 2011, Nadhir al-Majed, a prominent 39-year-old writer, was arrested at school and detained for 15 months. On 18 January 2017, he was sentenced to seven years in prison and a seven-year travel ban; he has also not been permitted to call his family or receive visits. The conviction was based on &quot;his participation in protests in 2011 over discrimination against Shia&quot; and &quot;his communication with international media and human rights organizations&quot;, supporting the right of Shia in the country. On 10 January, Abdulaziz al-Shubaily, a human rights activist, was re-sentenced to eight years in prison, an eight-year ban on using social media after his release and an eight-year travel ban; the charges included &quot;his incitement against the government and judiciary&quot; as well as &quot;his communication with international agencies against his government&quot;. He remains free on bail, however. On 8 January, Essam Koshak, 45, was detained without charge; he used social medial to highlight Saudi Arabia&#x27;s repression of dissident writers, activists, and advocates for their release. Since 2014, nearly all Saudi dissidents have been sentenced to a long jail term based on their activism in addition to arrest of all the activists associated with the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, which was dissolved in March 2013.

In September 2018, the Right Livelihood Award awarded three jailed Saudi human rights activists with the &quot;alternative Nobel prize&quot; award. Abdullah al-Hamid, Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani and Waleed Abu al-Khair were jointly awarded one million kronor cash award &quot;for their visionary and courageous efforts, guided by universal human rights principles, to reform the totalitarian political system in Saudi Arabia&quot;. , al-Hamid and al-Qahtani, founding members of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, were serving prison sentences of 11 and 10 years respectively, according to the charges for &quot;providing inaccurate information to foreign media, founding and operating an unlicensed human rights organization&quot;; while al-Khair, a lawyer and activist, was serving a sentence of 15 years for &quot;disobeying the ruler&quot;.

In 2018, a Saudi American journalist, Jamal Khashoggi was murdered inside a foreign embassy. He was a critic of Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, a 101-page report by the OHCHR accused the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the premeditated assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. The same year, British media group, The Guardian, claimed that it was being targeted by a cybersecurity unit in Saudi Arabia. The unit was directed to hack into the email accounts of the journalists probing into the various crises involving the royal court. The claim was made based on what is said to be a confidential internal order, signed in the name of Saud al-Qahtani, a close aide of the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman also named in the murder of Khashoggi.

In March 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; revealed that Saudi Arabia had been allegedly spying its citizens in the US. The British media cited that the nation has been readily exploiting the weakness in global mobile telecom network called SS7, and informed that the data reviewed by them shows millions of covert tracking requests for the US location of Saudi-registered phones since November 2019.

On 9 April 2020, prominent human rights activist Abdullah al-Hamid died in the prison after suffering a stroke. He was the founder of Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association and was arrested in 2013 for a peaceful protest.

In January 2021, Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi student at Leeds University, was arrested while visiting Saudi Arabia for holidays. In August 2022, she was given 34-year prison sentence for following and retweeting dissidents and activists on Twitter. Some of her tweets appeared to show support for Loujain al-Hathloul, a Saudi women&#x27;s rights activist who was imprisoned by Saudi Arabia earlier and was tortured. Later in August 2022, a woman named Nourah bint Saeed al-Qahtani was sentenced to 45 years in prison for &quot;using the internet to tear [Saudi Arabia&#x27;s] social fabric&quot;. Democracy for the Arab World Now connected these harsh prison sentences with US president Joe Biden&#x27;s visit to Jeddah in July 2022.

==Women&#x27;s rights==
===Guardianship system, segregation, and restrictions===
Saudi women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, such as the justice system, and under the male guardianship system are effectively treated as legal minors. Although they make up 70% of those enrolled in universities, for social reasons, women make up 5% of the workforce in Saudi Arabia, the lowest proportion in the world.
The treatment of women has been referred to as &quot;sex segregation&quot;, &quot;gender apartheid&quot;, and of some women being &quot;prisoners&quot; of their male relatives. Implementation of a government resolution supporting expanded employment opportunities for women met resistance from within the labor ministry, from the religious police, and from the male citizenry.

In many parts of Saudi Arabia, it is believed that a woman&#x27;s place is in the home caring for her husband and family, yet there are some women who do not adhere to this view and practice, and some run the house instead of the husband himself. Moreover, there is also some type of segregation at homes, such as different entrances for men and women.

Women&#x27;s rights are at the heart of calls for reform in Saudi Arabia – calls that are challenging the kingdom&#x27;s political status quo. Local and international women&#x27;s groups are also pushing governments to respond, taking advantage of the fact that some rulers are eager to project a more progressive image to the West. Since 2009, women and their male supporters have been organizing an anti male-guardianship campaign. Female leaders of this movement have been imprisoned without charge. Women in general who challenge the guardianship system may be sent to shelters for troubled women, where according to human rights activists they face torture and sexual abuse. Men are free to abuse women in Saudi Arabia, with reports of women being locked in their rooms for months or threatened with starvation or shooting for offenses such as getting the wrong kind of haircut or being in a relationship with a man the family has not approved. Women cannot file police reports without the permission of a male guardian, and may end up being imprisoned by the government for complaining. Women are prohibited from certain professions (such as optometry) and may be prohibited from mixing with men at work, but according to the government as of 2017 compose 30% of workers in the private sector (which is 40% of GDP).

The presence of powerful businesswomen—still a rare sight—in some of these groups helps get them heard. Prior to 2008, women were not allowed to enter hotels and furnished apartments without a chaperone or mahram. With a 2008 Royal Decree, however, the only requirement for a woman to be allowed to enter hotels is a national ID card, and (as with male guests) the hotel must inform the nearest police station of their room reservation and length of stay. In April 2010, a new, optional ID card for women was issued which allows them to travel in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The cards include GPS tracking, fingerprints and features that make them difficult to forge. Women do not need male permission to apply for the card, but do need it to travel abroad. Proponents argue that new female identity cards enable a woman to carry out her activities with ease, and prevent forgeries committed in the name of women.

Women first joined the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia in 2013, occupying thirty seats. Furthermore, that year three women were named as deputy chairpersons of three committees. Thurayya Obeid was named Deputy Chairwoman of the Human Rights and Petitions Committee, Zainab Abu Talib, Deputy Chairwoman of the Information and Cultural Committee, and Lubna Al-Ansari, Deputy Chairwoman of the Health Affairs and Environment Committee.
In 2013 the Directorate General of Passports allowed Saudi women married to foreigners to sponsor their children, so that the children can have residency permits (iqamas) with their mothers named as the sponsors, and have the right to work in the private sector in Saudi Arabia while on the sponsorship of their mothers, and the mother can also bring her children who are living abroad back to Saudi Arabia if they have no criminal records. Foreign men married to Saudi women were also granted the right to work in the private sector in Saudi Arabia while on the sponsorship of their wives on condition that the title on their iqamas should be written as &quot;husband of a Saudi wife&quot; and that they should have valid passports enabling them to return to their homes at any time. Saudi women married to foreigners, however, still face difficulty in passing their nationality to their children.

Also in 2013, Saudi Arabia registered its first female trainee lawyer, Arwa al-Hujaili. In Saudi courts, the testimony of women is weighted half that of a man&#x27;s.

According to the CIA world factbook, the female literacy rate is 82.2%, in comparison to 90.8% male literacy rate.

In the year 2018, the Saudi government changed several policies, allowing women to drive with the permission of their guardian, attend sporting events in gender-segregated areas, participate in sports (including exercising on public streets), and eliminated the need for male permission to receive education, get healthcare, or open a business. It began offering physical education for girls and said it would start licensing female-only gyms. The government opened the military to women in March, who can serve if they meet certain physical and educational requirements, continue to live with their male guardian in the province of service, and get male permission. It also granted divorced women the ability to retain custody of children without petitioning. Male permission is still required to apply for a passport, travel, marry, divorce, or leave jail. Men and women are also still segregated on public transport, beaches, and pools. In practice, some doctors still require male permission before providing services, and male permission may be needed to rent an apartment or file a legal claim. In 2019, the Saudi government has been taken new measures to release male guardianship. Thus, women will be soon allowed to travel abroad without the need of getting the permission of their male guardians.

In July 2018, two prominent female human rights activists, Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sada, were arrested for challenging Saudi Arabia&#x27;s male guardianship laws. According to Amnesty International, several arrested women&#x27;s rights activists detained without charge in Dhahban Prison are enduring torture by electrocution, flogging, hanging from the ceiling, and sexual assault.

In October 2018, under the predominant male guardianship system, a Saudi woman lost a legal battle to marry the man she wanted to because he played a musical instrument, many conservative Muslims in the kingdom consider music to be &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden). The male relative of the woman did not allow her to marry the man of her choice citing religious incompatibility as the man played oud.

Saudi Arabia is not a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which among many other issues prohibits forced marriages. However, it is part of the Human Rights council.

The World Economic Forum in its Global Gender Gap Report 2018 ranked Saudi Arabia 141 out of 149 countries on gender equality.

In 2019, the government also stated that women can start working in the military. In the past they could only work in police.

On 30 November 2020, seven European human rights ambassadors criticized Saudi Arabia over the continued detention of at least five women&#x27;s rights activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, whose case was referred to a special court for terrorism offenses in that month. On 25 November 2020, Loujain appeared in a Saudi court, as her trial was scheduled to start after 900 days in pre-trial detention. However, the court instead referred the case to the Specialized Criminal Court for terrorism and national security cases.

In February 2021, Saudi women were granted permission to join military and army professional fields. Women in Saudi Arabia can now be employed as soldiers, lance corporals, corporals, sergeants, and staff sergeants.

===Driving===

Saudi Arabia was the only country in the world where women were forbidden to drive motor vehicles until June 2018. The motoring ban was not in statute law, but was an &quot;informal&quot; religious fatwa imposed by conservative Muslim clerics in order to maintain the country&#x27;s tradition of gender segregation, although this religious view has changed in recent years.

In 1990, when 47 Saudi women drove cars through the streets of Riyadh in protest against the ban, protestors were punished and was reported: &quot;All the drivers, and their husbands, were barred from foreign travel for a year. Those women who had government jobs were fired, once their employers found out. And from hundreds of mosque pulpits, they were denounced by name as immoral women out to destroy Saudi society.&quot;

When the driving ban was enforced, women complained that &quot;we can&#x27;t move around without a male&quot;. Many could not afford chauffeurs, and the few buses that do operate in cities and towns across the Kingdom do not follow a set schedule. On 26 October 2013, a group of women started a movement to defy the ban by driving themselves. However, on 23 October, in a &quot;rare and explicit restating of the ban&quot;, Interior Ministry Spokesman General Mansur al-Turki warned: &quot;It is known that women in Saudi are banned from driving and laws will be applied against violators and those who demonstrate support.&quot; In December 2014, two women were arrested and sentenced to almost a month of prison for defying the female driving ban.

Women are allowed to fly aircraft, though they must be chauffeured to the airport. A Saudi woman made news in 2007 when she became the first woman to get her pilot&#x27;s license. The woman, Hanadi al-Hindi works for Saudi Prince Al Waleed.

Hisham Fageeh, a Saudi living in the US, has created a video which makes a reference to the Government&#x27;s rules which prevented women from driving. The video was released the same day many women in Saudi Arabia staged a nationwide protest against the Government.

In 2015, a Saudi woman working in neighboring UAE was arrested as she tried to enter Saudi Arabia. She had her passport taken from her and was forced to wait at the Saudi-UAE border without any food or water. She claimed that her UAE drivers license was valid in all GCC countries, but the Saudi border authorities refused to acknowledge its legitimacy.

In 2017, a royal decree was issued to allowing women to drive. The first driving license was issued to a Saudi woman in June 2018 and the ban on driving was lifted on 24 June 2018. Between the announcement and the lifting of the ban, the leaders of the Women to Drive campaign who violated the ban were arrested and tortured.

Male permission is still required to travel outside the home, so many women in conservative families are still not allowed to drive.

== LGBT rights ==

LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia are unrecognized as the official religion of the Kingdom views homosexuality and transgenderism as sins that need to be eliminated or corrected. Homosexuality is frequently a taboo subject in Saudi Arabian society and is punished with imprisonment, corporal punishment and capital punishment. Transgender people are generally associated with homosexuality and doctors are banned by the Saudi Ministry of Health from giving hormone replacement therapy to transgender people seeking to medically transition. In 2017, two transgender Pakistanis were allegedly tortured to death by Saudi police. Police later denied the reports.

==Human trafficking==

Saudi Arabia is a notable destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of slave labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, and many other countries voluntarily travel to Saudi Arabia as domestic servants or other low-skilled labourers, but some subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude.

Women, primarily from Asian and African countries are trafficked into Saudi Arabia for commercial sexual exploitation; others were kidnapped and forced into prostitution after running away from abusive employers.

Some Saudi men have also used contracted &quot;temporary marriages&quot; in countries such as Mauritania, Yemen, and Indonesia as a means by which to sexually exploit migrant workers. Women are led to believe they are being wed in earnest, but upon arrival in Saudi Arabia subsequently become their husbands&#x27; sexual slaves, are forced into domestic labor and, in some cases, prostitution. Prostitution is illegal in Saudi Arabia.

==Racism==
Racism in Saudi Arabia extends to allegations of imprisonment, physical abuse, rape, overwork and wage theft, especially of foreign workers who are given little protections under the law.

===Antisemitism===

During the Gulf War (1990–1991), when approximately a half million U.S. military personnel assembled in Saudi Arabia, and many were then stationed there, there were many Jewish U.S. service personnel in Saudi Arabia. It is reported that the Saudi government insisted that Jewish religious services not be held on their soil but that Jewish soldiers be flown to nearby US warships.

==Rights of foreigners==
=== Migrant workers&#x27; rights ===

According to the 2016 Amnesty International annual report, Saudi authorities detained and deported hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants, while tens of thousands were fired without having been paid for months and were left stranded without food, water or exit visas.

===Stateless people===
There are 70,000 stateless people in Saudi Arabia, also known as Bedoon. Some stateless are Yemenis who moved to Saudi Arabia, before the borders were in place.

This is also prevalent in neighboring UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.

=== Laborers&#x27; rights ===
Every summer, the Saudi Ministry of Labor and Social Development enforce a 3-months midday outdoor work ban. The main aim of this ban is to protect laborers from being directly exposed to the sun and high-temperature. Laborers, either Saudi Nationals or foreigners, are able to file any violations through the ministry&#x27;s portal.

According to other sources though, there are human rights violations, even during Ramadan. The workers might work less but they will be paid less.

==Sectarianism and freedom of religion==
Saudi Arabian law does not recognize religious freedom, and the public practice of non-Muslim religions is actively prohibited.

No law specifically requires citizens to be Muslims, but article 12.4 of the Naturalization Law requires that applicants attest to their religious affiliation, and article 14.1 requires that applicants get a certificate endorsed by their local cleric. The Government has declared the Quran and the Sunna (tradition) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad to be the country&#x27;s constitution. Neither the Government nor society in general accepts the concepts of separation of religion and state, and such separation does not exist. The legal system is based on Shari&#x27;a (Islamic law), with Shari&#x27;a courts basing their judgments largely on a code derived from the Quran and the Sunna. According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi Arabia &quot;systematically discriminates against its Muslim religious minorities, in particular Shia and Ismailis&quot;, but the Government permits Shi&#x27;a Muslims to use their own legal tradition to adjudicate noncriminal cases within their community.

Testifying before the US Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Ali al-Ahmed, Director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, stated:

Saudi Arabia is a glaring example of religious apartheid. The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curriculums, and all religious instructions in media are restricted to the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jewish and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, there has not been a single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy. The branch of Imam Mohamed Bin Saud University in Fairfax, Virginia instructs its students that Shia Islam is a Jewish conspiracy.

In 2014, Saudi Arabia enacted new &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; legislation. Human Rights Watch criticized the broad language of the legislation and related government decrees, which have been used to prosecute and punish peaceful political activists and dissidents. HEW stated &quot;these recent laws and regulations turn almost any critical expression or independent association into crimes of terrorism.&quot; A number of prominent human rights activists were detained under the new law, including Waleed Abulkhair and Mikhlif Alshammari. Interior Ministry regulations also defined &quot;calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based&quot; as terrorism.

===International law===

Saudi Arabia abstained from the United Nations vote adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, saying it contradicted sharia law.
It is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes freedom of religion. The country holds a reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child against any provisions that are in conflict with sharia law; Article 14 gives freedom of &quot;thought, conscience and religion&quot; to children. 

Saudi Arabia and some of the Gulf states have been carrying out airstrikes on the Yemen, violating international laws and arresting anyone that criticizes them.

===Jews===
There has been virtually no Jewish activity in Saudi Arabia since the beginning of the 21st century. Census data do not identify any Jews as residing within Saudi Arabian territory.

===Christians===

As an Islamic state, Saudi Arabia gives preferential treatment for Muslims. During Ramadan, eating, drinking, or smoking in public during daylight hours is not allowed. Foreign schools are often required to teach a yearly introductory segment on Islam.
Saudi religious police have detained Shi&#x27;ite pilgrims participating in the Hajj, allegedly calling them &quot;infidels in Mecca&quot;. The restrictions on the Shi&#x27;a branch of Islam in the Kingdom along with the banning of displaying Jewish, Hindu and Christian symbols have been referred to as apartheid.

The Saudi government has gone further than stopping Christians from worshipping in publicly designated buildings to even raid private prayer meetings among Christian believers in their own homes. On 15 December 2011, Saudi security forces arrested 35 Ethiopian Christians in Jeddah who were praying in a home, beating them and threatening them with death. When the Ethiopian workers&#x27; employers asked security forces for what reason they were arrested, they said &quot;for practicing Christianity&quot;. Later, under mounting international pressure, this charge was changed to &quot;mixing with the opposite sex&quot;.

In December 2012, Saudi religious police detained more than 41 individuals after storming a house in the Saudi Arabian province of al-Jouf. They were accused of &quot;plotting to celebrate Christmas,&quot; according to a 26 December statement released by the police branch. Proselytizing by non-Muslims, including the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials such as Bibles, is illegal in Saudi Arabia.

===Shia Muslims===

The Saudi government has often been viewed as an active oppressor of Shia Muslims because of the funding of the Wahhabi ideology which denounces the Shia faith.

In 1988, fatwas passed by the country&#x27;s leading cleric, Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz denounced the Shias as apostates. Another by Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin, a member of the Higher Council of Ulama is on record as saying

Some people say that the rejectionists (&quot;Rafidha&quot;, i.e. Shia) are Muslims because they believe in God and Muhammad, pray and fast. But I say they are heretics. They are the most vicious enemy of Muslims, who should be wary of their plots. They should be boycotted and expelled so that Muslims be spared their evil.

According to Vali Nasr, al-Jibrin&#x27;s sanctioning of the killing of Shia was reiterated in Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002.

According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch report, Shia citizens in Saudi Arabia &quot;face systematic discrimination in religion, education, justice, and employment&quot;.

Saudi Arabia has no Shia cabinet ministers, mayors or police chiefs, according to another source, Vali Nasr, unlike other countries with sizable Shia populations (such as Iraq and Lebanon). Shia are kept out of &quot;critical jobs&quot; in the armed forces and the security services, and not one of the three hundred Shia girls&#x27; schools in the Eastern Province has a Shia principal.

In November 2014 at al-Dalwah village in the eastern province of al-Ahsa, three unknown masked gunmen opened fire at a Husseiniya, or Shi&#x27;ite religious center, killing eight and injuring dozens.

While the government and the official media and religious establishment strongly condemned the attack, a handful of articles in the Saudi press argued that the attack &quot;had not come out of nowhere&quot;, that there was anti-Shi&#x27;ite incitement in the kingdom on the part of &quot;the religious establishment, preachers, and even university lecturers – and that it was on the rise&quot;.

Shiites are banned from building mosques and other religious centers and are forced to perform Friday prayers in homes (Al-Hassan). In the Eastern city of Al-Khobar, whose population is predominately Shia, there are no Shia mosques. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s religious police mandate prayers and all those in public buildings during prayer time are required to stop what they are doing to pray. Because there are minor differences between the way that Shiites and Sunnis pray and between prayer times, Shiites are forced to either pray the Sunni way or take a break from work.

In 2009, a group of Shiites on their way to perform hajj pilgrimage (one of the five pillars of Islam that all able-bodied Muslims are required to perform once in their lives) in Mecca were arrested by Saudi religious police. Between 20 and 24 February 2009, Shia pilgrims from the heavily Shia Eastern Province who had come to Medina for the anniversary of Muhammad&#x27;s death clashed with Sunni religious police at the Baqi&#x27; cemetery over doctrinal differences concerning the rituals surrounding commemoration of the dead. Security forces shot a 15-year-old pilgrim in the chest, and an unknown civilian stabbed a Shia religious sheikh in the back with a knife, shouting &quot;Kill the rejectionist [Shia]&quot;. The authorities denied that anyone had been wounded and played down the ensuing arrests of Shia pilgrims.

Religious police have arrested Shia women in the Eastern Province for matters as trivial as organizing classes for Quranic studies and selling clothing for religious ceremonies as if they were involved in political activities which are not allowed in KSA.

In the eastern city of Dammam where three quarters of the 400,000 residents are Shia, there are no Shia mosques or prayer halls, no Shia call to prayer broadcast on TV, and no cemeteries for Shia.

In late 2011, a Shiite pilgrim was charged for being &quot;involved with blasphemy&quot; and sentenced to 500 lashes and 2 years in jail. A prominent Shiite Canadian cleric, Usama al-Attar was also charged. He was released on the same day, declaring the arrest entirely unprovoked.

Much of education in Saudi Arabia is based on Sunni Wahhabi religious material. From a very young age, students are taught that Shiites are not Muslims and that Shiism is a conspiracy hatched by the Jews, and so Shiites are worthy of death. Government Wahhabi scholars, such as Abdulqader Shaibat al-Hamd, have proclaimed on state radio that Sunni Muslims must not &quot;eat their [Shia] food, marry from them, or bury their dead in Muslims&#x27; graveyards&quot;.

The government has restricted the names that Shias can use for their children in an attempt to discourage them from showing their identity. Saudi textbooks are hostile to Shiism, often characterizing the faith as a form of heresy worse than Christianity and Judaism.

Because anti-Shia attitudes are engrained from an early age, they are passed down from generation to generation. This prejudice is found not only in textbooks, but also within the teachers in the classroom, and even in the university setting. (Wahhabi) teachers frequently tell classrooms full of young Shia schoolchildren that they are heretics. Teachers who proclaim that Shiites are atheists and deserve death have faced no repercussions for their actions, barely even receiving punishment. At a seminar about the internet, held in King Abdulaziz City of Science and Technology, professor Bader Hmood Albader explained that the internet was beneficial to society, but that there were many Shia websites claiming to be Muslim websites, which needed to be stopped.

Much discrimination occurs in the Saudi workforce as well. Shiites are prohibited from becoming teachers of religious subjects, which constitute about half of the courses in secondary education. Shiites cannot become principals of schools. Some Shiites have become university professors but often face harassment from students and faculty alike. Shiites are disqualified as witnesses in court, as Saudi Sunni sources cite the Shi&#x27;a practice of Taqiyya, wherein it is permissible to lie while they are in fear or at risk of significant persecution. Shia cannot serve as judges in ordinary court, and are banned from gaining admission to military academies, and from high-ranking government or security posts, including becoming pilots in Saudi Airlines.

The Saudi government has often been viewed as an active oppressor of Shias because of the funding of the Wahabbi ideology which denounces the Shia faith. In 1988, fatwas passed by the country&#x27;s leading cleric, Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz denounced the Shias as apostates.

According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch report, Shia citizens in Saudi Arabia &quot;face systematic discrimination in religion, education, justice, and employment&quot;.

In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr, who had called for pro-democracy demonstrations, along with 47 other Saudi citizens sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court on terrorism charges.

In May 2019, Human Rights Watch said that Saudi Arabia was seeking to extend the jail term for Sheikh Mohammad bin Hassan al-Habib, who the human rights group described as &quot;a cleric known for supporting protests against the systematic discrimination of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Shia minority&quot;. At the time, Hassan al-Habib had been serving a seven-year prison sentence.

==== 2017 al-Awamiyah clashes ====
The &quot;Associated Press&quot; reports that, in 2017, the Saudi government &quot;razed homes belonging to Shia residents&quot; in a several-hundred years old area in al-Awamiyah. Saudi officials said that the area provided a haven for militant groups and stated that it would redevelop the area in which it razed homes. &quot;The Independent&quot; reports that a three-year-old and a two-year-old were killed by gunfire resulting from violence between government forces and armed anti-government protestors. The clashes began in May 2017, By August, locals had reported that between one- and two-dozen people had been killed in the shelling of the city and by sniper fire in what &quot;The Independent&quot; described as a &quot;siege&quot;. According to an estimate provided by residents of the city, 20,000 residents were fled the city in response to the violence.

===Charges of magic, witchcraft, and sorcery===
According to Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch in 2009, &quot;Saudi judges have harshly punished confessed &#x27;witches&#x27; for what at worst appears to be fraud, but may well be harmless acts.&quot; In 2009, the Saudi &quot;religious police&quot; established a special &quot;Anti-Witchcraft Unit&quot; to educate the public, investigate and combat witchcraft.

Among the people executed in Saudi for magic and sorcery, and often other charges, are Egyptian pharmacist Mustafa Ibrahim (beheaded in 2007 in Riyadh), Muree bin Ali bin Issa al-Asiri (found in possession of talismans and executed in Najran province in June 2012), Amina bin Salem Nasser (executed in December 2011 in Jawf), and Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki (a Sudanese migrant worker executed in a car park in Medina on 20 September 2011). Ali Hussain Sibat, a Lebanese host of a popular fortune-telling TV program, was arrested while in Saudi in May 2008 on Umrah and sentenced to death but finally released sometime in 2011 or 2012.

Many convicted of magic receive lesser punishments of lashes and/or prison. In 2011, the &quot;Anti-Witchcraft Unit&quot; processed over 586 cases of magical crime. In 2012 there were 215 witchcraft arrests made. The majority of these offenders are foreign domestic workers from Africa and Indonesia. Foreign domestic workers who bring unfamiliar traditional religious or folk customs are a disproportionately affected by the anti-witchcraft campaign according to Human Rights Watch researchers Adam Coogle and Cristoph Wilcke. Saudis assume folk practices are &quot;some kind of sorcery or witchcraft&quot;, and widespread belief in witchcraft means it can be invoked as a defense in Sharia courts against workers complaining of mistreatment by Saudi employers. Human Rights Watch believes that the conviction of a Syrian national, &#x27;Abd al-Karim Mara&#x27;I al-Naqshabandi, who was executed in 1996 for undertaking &quot;the practice of works of magic and spells and possession of a collection of polytheistic and superstitious books, was actually resulted from a dispute with his employer Prince Salman bin Sa&#x27;ud bin &#x27;Abd al&#x27;Aziz, a nephew of King Fahd&quot;.

==Extraterritorial harassment, forced repatriation, and killing==
About 1,200 people fled Saudi Arabia and sought asylum in other countries in 2017, including many women fleeing forced marriages or abusive male family members. The Saudi government has frozen bank accounts, arrested family members, and revoked official documents in an attempt to get fleeing citizens to return to the country or to a Saudi embassy. Students studying abroad have been threatened with termination of scholarships in response to criticism of the Saudi government on social media. In 2018, some studying in Canada were de-funded after the Canadian government criticized human rights in Saudi Arabia. Women who have successfully gained asylum in Western countries report fearing for their personal safety after being harassed by Saudi government agents on social media, and sometimes in person, warning them that they will be sorry for their actions or be punished. Occasionally they are asked to go to Saudi embassies for no stated reason. One woman, unlike most, reported going to the embassy to try to end harassment of a firm she had left to her business partners, but she said authorities attempted to get her to return, threatened her, and said the business would continue to have problems as long as she remained in Germany.

The Saudi government is suspected of being behind the disappearance of its critic Naser al-Sa&#x27;id from Lebanon in 1979. Human rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was forcibly repatriated from the United Arab Emirates in 2017, jailed for a short time, banned from future international travel, and then disappeared after being arrested again in 2018. Her husband was forcibly repatriated from Jordan. In 2016, three women and seven children who fled to Lebanon were arrested by Lebanese police and returned to Saudi Arabia minutes after using a bank card.

In April 2017, 24-year-old Dina Ali attempted to flee from Saudi Arabia to Australia via the Philippines to escape a forced marriage. Despite her pleas for international assistance over social media, airport personnel in the Philippines blocked her from boarding her flight to Sydney, and handed her over to Saudi authorities. She was duct taped and forcibly repatriated to Saudi Arabia, where she feared her family would kill her.

In January 2019, Rahaf Mohammed attempted a similar flight from a forced marriage, traveling to Australia via Kuwait and Thailand. She also said that her family threatened to kill her for leaving Islam (which is also a capital offense in Saudi Arabia). After her passport was taken and authorities in Thailand acted at the request of the Saudi government to stop her travel, she barricaded herself in her hotel room and pleaded on social media for international assistance. The UNHCR and the government of Canada intervened, and Rahaf travelled successfully to Canada via South Korea. Other Saudi women have done similar things.

On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in order to deal with paperwork related to his marriage. A veteran Saudi journalist who had become a vocal critic of Saudi regime, upon arrival Khashoggi was assassinated and dismembered. In the previous September, Khashoggi had fled Saudi Arabia after the arrests of other Saudi intellectuals, clerics and activists, fearing that he too would be arrested or banned from travelling. On 3 October, a Saudi official claimed that Khashoggi had been neither detained nor killed, saying: &quot;He is not in the consulate nor in Saudi custody.&quot; Ibrahim Kalin, Turkish presidential spokesman, said: &quot;According to the information we have, this person who is a Saudi citizen is still at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.&quot; Three weeks after Khashoggi went missing, Saudi authorities acknowledged that he had been killed at the consulate and that his body was removed from the consulate. The killing was described as &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;a tremendous mistake&quot; by Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. On 25 October 2018, one of the Saudi public prosecutors told the media that Khashoggi&#x27;s murder was &quot;premeditated&quot;.

==Human rights organizations==
===Independent===
The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in the Arabian Peninsula is a Saudi Arabian human rights organization based in Beirut since 1992.

The Human Rights First Society applied unsuccessfully for a governmental license in 2002, but was allowed to function informally. The Association for the Protection and Defense of Women&#x27;s Rights in Saudi Arabia was created in 2007 and is also unlicensed.

The Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) was created in 2009. One of its co-founders, Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi, was arbitrarily arrested by Mabahith, the internal security agency, on 21 March 2011, during the 2011 Saudi Arabian protests. Al-Bejadi was charged in the Specialized Criminal Court in August 2011 for &quot;insurrection against the ruler, instigating demonstrations, and speaking with foreign [media] channels&quot;. Another co-founder, Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani, was charged for his human rights activities in June 2012.

Sixteen people who tried to create a human rights organization in 2007 were arrested in February 2007, charged in August 2010, and convicted on 22 November 2011 of &quot;forming a secret [organization], attempting to seize power, incitement against the King, financing terrorism, and money laundering&quot; and sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court to 5–30 years&#x27; imprisonment, to be followed by travel bans. They appealed on 22 January 2012.

The Society for Development and Change was created to campaign for equal human rights for Shia Muslims in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The organisation calls for a constitution and elected legislature for Eastern Province. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which started operating around 2013, campaigns for Saudi human rights in general, including reports on what its leader Ali Adubisi describes as the Saudi government&#x27;s &quot;war&quot; against the Eastern Province. ALQST is a Saudi human rights organisation created in August 2014 by Yahya Assiri, with a Saudi-based team for collecting evidence and a London-based team for reports and human rights campaigning.

===Government-associated===
In 2004, the National Society for Human Rights, associated with the Saudi government, was created. Most of the commission&#x27;s directors are members of the Saudi &quot;religious and political establishment&quot; according to John R. Bradley.

The Human Rights Commission is a government organization established in September 2005. It claims to be fully independent from the government in performing its responsibilities. In March 2019 it opposed international investigation of the 2 October 2018 assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.

== HIV/AIDS ==
By law, all Saudi citizens who are infected with HIV or AIDS are entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy and employment opportunities. However, most hospitals will not treat patients who are infected, and many schools and hospitals are reluctant to distribute government information about the disease because of the strong taboos and stigma that are attached to how the virus can be spread.

Until the late 1990s, information on HIV/AIDS was not widely available to the public, but this has started to change. In the late 1990s, the government started to recognize World AIDS Day and allowed information about the disease to be published in newspapers. The number of people living in the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret. However, in 2003 the government announced the number of known cases of HIV/AIDS in the country to be 6,700, and over 10,000 in June 2008.

==International conventions==
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ratified the International Convention against Torture in October 1997 according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Human rights of Saudi Arabia are specified in article 26 of the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia. Recently created human rights organizations include Human Rights First Society (2002), Association for the Protection and Defense of Women&#x27;s Rights in Saudi Arabia (2007), Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (2009) and the government-associated National Society for Human Rights (2004). In 2008, the Shura Council ratified the Arab Charter on Human Rights. In 2011, the Specialized Criminal Court was used to charge and sentence human rights activists.

==Responses and criticisms==
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Counter Terrorism, Ben Emmerson, criticized Saudi Arabia for violating human rights in the name of fighting terrorism during his visit to Saudi Arabia from 30 April to 4 May 2017. According to the report, Saudi Arabia uses its terrorism tribunal and counter-terrorism law to unjustly prosecute human rights defenders, writers, and peaceful critics.

At the U.N. Third Millennium Summit in New York City, King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz defended Saudi Arabia&#x27;s position on human rights, saying: &quot;It is absurd to impose on an individual or a society rights that are alien to its beliefs or principles.&quot;

Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs issued a statement via Twitter on 2 August 2018 expressing Canada&#x27;s concern over the recent arrest of Samar Badawi, a human rights activist and sister of imprisoned Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, and called for the release of Saudi human rights activists. In response to Canada&#x27;s criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada&#x27;s ambassador and froze all new trade with Canada.

A joint statement released by 36 countries at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2019, condemned the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, called for the release of Saudi women&#x27;s rights activists detained in May 2018, and urged the kingdom to stop using counter-terrorism regulations to target dissidents and human rights activists. The letter, which is the first collective rebuke of the kingdom, demanded the release of prominent women activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Hatoon al-Fassi and Samar Badawi.

In July 2019, following increased pressure from non-profit organization Human Rights Foundation, Nicki Minaj pulled out of the Jeddah World Fest, Saudi Arabia in support of the nation&#x27;s suppressed women and LGBTQ community. Minaj said, &quot;I could make one mistake &amp; go to jail in a diff country where women have no rights,&quot; after learning about the constant abuse of human rights in the nation. The organization lauded Minaj&#x27;s decision and urged other artists of the likes of Steve Aoki and Liam Payne from performing in the nation.

In November 2019, ahead of Saudi Spanish Super Cup due to be held in January 2020, Spanish broadcaster RTVE said that it will not bid for the hosting rights of the tournament because of human rights concern, especially women rights in the field of sports. &quot;It&#x27;s a country where until very recently women couldn&#x27;t go to watch football,&quot; the broadcasting service said. RFEF President Luis Rubiales, defended the claims and said, he could assure women would be allowed to enter without any restrictions.

In January 2020, Human Rights Watch alongside 11 other international rights group organizations wrote a joint letter to the Amaury Sport Organization following its decision to move Dakar Rally to Saudi Arabia. The rights group in their letter accused Saudi Arabia of violating women&#x27;s rights in the nation and asked the French organizer to denounce the persecution of women&#x27;s rights, as well as adopt the human rights policy. &quot;The Amaury Sport Organisation and race drivers at the Dakar Rally should speak out about the Saudi government&#x27;s mistreatment of women&#x27;s rights activists for advocating for the right to drive,&quot; the statement from the Human Rights Watch global initiatives director read.

In January 2020, Meghan MacLaren withdrew from Saudi leg of Ladies European Tour due to be held in March 2020. The golfer cited she cannot ignore what organizations like Amnesty International have highlighted. &quot;I&#x27;ve decided not to play based on what I think sport is being used to do in Saudi Arabia&quot;, she said while emphasizing on the appalling human rights record of the nation. &quot;We take for granted a lot of the choices and freedom we have available to us, but I try to make my decisions based on who I am as a person, not just a golfer,&quot; statement from her interview further read.

On 13 July 2020, Richard Masters, the CEO of Premier League was urged by the families of human rights campaigners, who are in Saudi prison, to stop the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia, while their loved ones remain imprisoned.

On 15 January 2022, the three-time Grand Slam champion, Andy Murray, rejected seven-figure appearance fee to play in Saudi Arabia over human rights concerns. The event was also fiercely criticised by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for attempting to cleanse the nation&#x27;s reputation on the international stage.

<text>Eugene Francis &quot;Gene&quot; Whelan (11 July 1924 – 19 February 2013) was a Canadian politician, sitting in the House of Commons from 1962 to 1984, and in the Senate from 1996 to 1999. He was also Minister of Agriculture under Pierre Trudeau from 1972 to 1984, and became one of Canada&#x27;s best-known politicians. During his career, he would meet Queen Elizabeth II, help Canada beat U.S. president Richard Nixon to the punch in &quot;opening up&quot; China, and play a catalyzing role in the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of the Cold War. In an editorial immediately following his death, the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; said:

Whelan was always known as a die hard Liberal. He loved to boast,

When he announced that he was running for the Liberal leadership in 1984, he said:

==Early years==
Eugene Whelan was born in Amherstburg, Ontario, the middle of nine children born to Irish-Canadian farmers Charles B. Whelan and Frances L. Kelly. He was educated in Windsor and Walkerville. At 16, Whelan quit school and worked for a time as a welder and tool and die maker before returning to farming.

In 1960, Whelan married Elizabeth Pollinger and they had a family. One daughter went into politics (see Family below). His brother Edward Charles Whelan made his life in Saskatchewan. He also went into politics, being elected and serving in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

==Political career==

Whelan entered municipal politics at age 21 and surprisingly won an election to the separate school board of Anderdon Township, which administered Catholic schools. He was next elected as councillor and eventually reeve of the township council, becoming warden of the Essex County council in 1962. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Ontario assembly in 1959.

During that time, he supported himself as a farmer and became active in farm issues and groups. He became a director and president of the Harrow Farmer&#x27;s Co-operative, served on the boards of United Co-operatives of Ontario and the Co-operators Insurance Company, and was a founding member of the Ontario Wheat Producers&#x27; Marketing Board and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture.

Whelan first won a seat in the House of Commons in the 1962 election, representing the southwestern Ontario riding of Essex, and held it until his retirement in 1984. Whelan ran to succeed Trudeau at the 1984 Liberal leadership convention, but came in last. In 1996, Whelan was appointed to the Senate by Jean Chrétien, and served in the chamber until he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 in 1999.

===Minister of Agriculture===
In 1972, Whelan was appointed as Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet of Pierre Trudeau, and held the position until Trudeau&#x27;s retirement in 1984, except during the 1979-1980 Joe Clark government.

He once recalled a time when his qualifications for Minister were questioned:
As Minister, Whelan promoted the extension of national marketing boards first implemented with the creation of the Canadian Dairy Commission in 1970 to eggs in 1972, turkey in 1974, and chicken in 1978. These were placed under the supervision of the National Farm Products Council. For those commodities not under supply management, he fought to maintain a level playing field in world markets at a time when other countries strongly subsidized such products. He was successful in getting the Canadian government to increase its support for farmers, through amendments to the &quot;Agricultural Stabilization Act&quot; and the introduction of the &quot;Western Grain Stabilization Act&quot;. In 1977, the &quot;Advance Payments for Crops Act&quot; was passed, which guaranteed loans to producers requiring advance payments for perishable crops. He opened markets in the Soviet Union for Canadian wheat, and established legislation to protect fruit and vegetable growers from processor bankruptcies. He also restricted the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board, allowing private-sector feed grain trading and inter-provincial movement of feed.

Whelan&#x27;s English was rough-hewn, and his French was non-existent. He openly acknowledged this, exclaiming:
Whelan was one of Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s best constitutional campaigners. However, in 1976 angry Quebec dairy farmers threw diluted milk on Whelan after cabinet refused to approve dairy subsidies to compensate
farmers in a collapsed world market. Whelan said this refusal contributed to the success of the Parti Québécois in rural ridings that fall.

His green stetson hat became well-known and Whelan was seen as an ardently vociferous advocate for the agricultural sector, with a habit for plain-spokenness (which occasionally got him in trouble). In response to complaints voiced over the cost of food, when he wanted to stress the average farmer&#x27;s narrow profit margin, he said:

===Catalyst for Russian &quot;perestroika&quot;===
During his last term as Minister of Agriculture, Whelan became good friends with Aleksandr Yakovlev, then the USSR&#x27;s Ambassador to Canada, as both men were ardent agriculturalists. The relationship became so close that Pierre Trudeau called him in to get assurance that Whelan had not divulged any national secrets, as the minister was a member of the Cabinet defence committee. When Mikhail Gorbachev, then Soviet Minister of Agriculture, came to Canada in 1983, Yakovlev connected Gorbachev with Whelan, who arranged a three-week tour across Canada for both Soviet officials, accompanied personally by Whelan.

In 2013 Jean Chrétien recalled Whelan introducing Gorbachev to Canadian life when the tour came to Windsor:

At the end of that tour, the Whelans hosted a farewell reception for Gorbachev at their Amherstburg home on the evening of 19 May 1983. Whelan was delayed in arriving. In what has since been called &quot;the walk that changed the world&quot;, Yakovlev and Gorbachev walked in a nearby orchard, strolled among saplings and past fields of corn, soy and wheat, had an earnest discussion, and resolved that the old ways in the USSR had to end.

According to Yakovlev, this was where &quot;perestroika&quot; was born, with 80% of its features discussed while visiting Whelan&#x27;s farm.

In an interview years later, Yakovlev recalled:
==Broadcasting==
Whelan was once host of the &quot;Agricultural Hour&quot; on CFRA in Ottawa.

==International appointments==
He served as president of the United Nations World Food Council from 1983 to 1985. Whelan was appointed as Canadian ambassador to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome. Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leader Brian Mulroney promised to rescind the appointment if he became Prime Minister. Mulroney won the 1984 election, and recalled Whelan as one of his first acts of office.

Whelan also actively participated in the Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER), an international non-governmental organization which forged a dialogue between food-surplus and energy-surplus nations, their private sectors, and multilateral agencies. Working with US Senator Jennings Randolph (D-WV) - a noted humanitarian- and Lord Walston of the United Kingdom and others, Whelan helped the AER to gain United Nations recognition in 1985. Whelan joined AER&#x27;s Committee of Honor and rose to become AER&#x27;s vice chairman. As such he presided at a number of international conferences in the late 1980s.

==Honours==

*In 1984, the Woodslee soil substation of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada&#x27;s Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Centre, located at Woodslee, Ontario, was renamed as the Honourable Eugene F. Whelan Experimental Farm.
*In 2008, the Whelan ancestral home, where Eugene was born, was relocated for preservation to the Canadian Transportation Museum and Historical Village in Essex, Ontario.

==Family==
Whelan and his wife Elizabeth had three daughters. Susan Whelan went into politics and was elected to the House of Commons in 1993 in her father&#x27;s old riding. In 2001 she was appointed as Minister of International Trade in Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet. She was dropped from Cabinet with the change of administrations when Paul Martin became prime minister.

==Death and funeral==
He died at his home in Amherstburg on February 19, 2013, following complications from heart disease and colon cancer. His funeral was held on February 23, 2013, at St. John The Baptist Church in Amherstburg, and he was buried in the church cemetery. Jean Chrétien, Herb Gray and Remo Mancini were among the people that gave eulogies at the service.

<doc id="543257" wikidata="Q5638396" url="?curid=543257" title="Hafner Manufacturing Company">
<text>The Hafner Manufacturing Company was a maker of tinplate clockwork-powered O gauge toy trains, based in Chicago, Illinois, from 1914 to 1951. It was formed when its founder, William Frederick Hafner, a co-founder of American Flyer, left the company in favor of creating his own company.

== Background ==
The reasons for Hafner departing American Flyer, the company he helped found, are lost to history. In the book &quot;Greenberg&#x27;s Guide to American Flyer Prewar O Gauge,&quot; author Alan R. Schuweiler cites three possibilities: Hafner may not have known what official position he held in the company, he may have sought a larger share of the company, and he may have been passed over in favor of his co-founder&#x27;s son, William Ogden Coleman Jr.

== Company history ==
During its peak periods, it employed as many as 150 people. While Hafner was able to quickly gain distribution from catalog retailer G. Sommers &amp; Co., it never received the widespread distribution of the so-called &quot;Big Four&quot; of American Flyer, Lionel, Dorfan, and Ives.

The early Hafner trains bore the Overland Flyer brand and closely resembled competing offerings from American Flyer. As late as 1917 a car appeared in American Flyer&#x27;s product line that closely resembled a Hafner design. This suggests the two companies worked together in their early days, or that one or both companies copied designs from the other. Since American Flyer was known to have purchased rolling stock from German competitor Bing, it is possible that American Flyer also purchased from Hafner, or vice versa.

Unlike most its competitors, not including Marx, Hafner survived the Great Depression without making significant changes to its product line, since it always specialized in inexpensive train sets that sold for US$3 or less. World War II proved a greater challenge. Since toy production was prohibited after 1942, toy companies had to adapt. While Marx, Lionel and the A. C. Gilbert Company were able to secure government contracts to manufacture items with military applications, Hafner lacked the tooling and manufacturing expertise to do the same. Hafner survived by forming a symbiotic relationship with the Fox Brewing Company. Fox was unable to secure bottlecaps from any other source, while Hafner was unable to make much else.

== Ownership changes ==
William Hafner&#x27;s son John Hafner took over the company in 1933, but the elder Hafner stayed involved with the company until his death in 1944. John Hafner ran the company until 1951, when he sold the company to All Metal Products Company, the makers of the Wyandotte brand of toys. In a 1992 interview, Hafner said he was glad to get out of the business, citing increased difficulty competing with larger toy manufacturers.

Hafner&#x27;s new ownership faced the same difficulties, and by 1956 was out of business and in liquidation. Louis Marx and Company purchased the Hafner tooling, then shipped it to its subsidiary in Mexico, where it was used to produce inexpensive windup and battery-powered sets. Many Marx collectors believe Louis Marx&#x27;s primary motivation for the purchase was to eliminate another competitor from the marketplace.

The clockwork locomotives and colorful lithographed tinplate rolling stock placed Hafner at the low end of the market. Unlike most of its competitors, Hafner never created an electric train. Any Hafner electric trains that exist today were retrofitted with a motor from another manufacturer. Electrifying Hafner locomotives by outfitting them with surplus Marx electric motors is a somewhat common practice.

Both Hafner and Marx were known to use &quot;recycled&quot; lithography, a cost-saving practice where the tinplate from defective print runs was flipped over and printed on the blank side and used. The result of this is hidden graphics on the interior of cars and accessories. In addition to re-using its own defective sheets, Hafner would sometimes buy defective sheets from other companies as scrap and use it. Some Hafner collectors specialize in collecting these variations. Additionally, some metal products from the mid-20th century such as flashlights have surfaced with Hafner lithography inside, which indicates that Hafner sold its surplus or unusable print runs for use in the manufacture of products that would be painted.

<text>Garry Kent Marshall (November 13, 1934 – July 19, 2016) was an American screenwriter, film director, producer and actor. Marshall began his career in the 1960s as a writer for &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; until he developed the television adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. He rose to fame in the 1970s for creating the ABC sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974–1984).

Marshall went on to direct numerous films including &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot; (1982), &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986), &quot;Overboard&quot; (1987), &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988), &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; (1991), &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; (1994), &quot;Dear God&quot; (1996), &quot;The Other Sister&quot; and &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (Both in 1999), &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001), &quot;Raising Helen&quot; (2004), &quot;Georgia Rule&quot; (2007), &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (2011), and &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (2016). 

As an actor, Marshall appeared in the films &quot;Lost in America&quot; (1985), &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992), &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993) along with his sister Penny Marshall, &quot;With Friends Like These...&quot; (1998), &quot;Orange County&quot; (2002), &quot;Keeping Up with the Steins&quot; (2006), &quot;Race to Witch Mountain&quot; (2009), and &quot;Life After Beth&quot; (2014). He also provided voice acting roles in the animated films &quot;The Majestic&quot; (2001) and &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005).

==Early life and family==
Garry Kent Marshall was born in Manhattan on November 13, 1934, the only son and the eldest child of Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Masciarelli (later Anthony Wallace Marshall; 1906–1999), a director of industrial films and producer, and Marjorie Irene (née Ward; 1908–1983), the owner and teacher in a tap dance school. He was the brother of actress-director Penny Marshall and Ronny Marshall Hallin, a television producer. His father was of Italian descent, his family having come from San Martino sulla Marrucina, Chieti, Abruzzo, and his mother was of German, English, Irish and Scottish ancestry. His father changed his last name from Masciarelli to Marshall before his son Garry was born. Garry Marshall was baptized Presbyterian and also raised Lutheran for a time.

He attended De Witt Clinton High School and Northwestern University, where he wrote a sports column for &quot;The Daily Northwestern&quot;, and was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Beginning in 1956, Marshall served a stint in the U.S. Army as a writer for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; and &quot;Seoul News&quot;, and was production chief for Armed Forces Radio Network; serving in Korea.

On March 9, 1963, Marshall married Barbara Sue Wells. They resided in Los Angeles; the couple have three children: Scott; Lori (with whom he co-wrote a book); and Kathleen (who appeared in all of his films).

==Career==

Marshall began his career as a joke writer for such comedians as Joey Bishop and Phil Foster and became a writer for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jack Paar. He originally partnered with writer Fred Freeman.

In 1961, he and Freeman moved to Hollywood, where they broke into writing sitcoms on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;. Freeman, however, found that he did not enjoy sitcom work, and moved back to New York. Marshall teamed up with writing partner Jerry Belson, and the two worked together through the 1960s. The pair worked on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Their first television series as creator-producers was &quot;Hey, Landlord&quot;, which lasted one season (1966–67). Then they adapted Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; for television. Moving into the 1970s, Marshall worked on his own or with others, and created &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (starring his sister Penny, who had earlier had a recurring role on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;), and &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, which were produced by his associates Thomas L. Miller, Robert L. Boyett, and Edward K. Milkis. He was also a co-creator of &quot;Makin&#x27; It&quot;, which the three men also produced.

In the early 1980s, he met Héctor Elizondo while playing basketball, and they became great friends. Elizondo appeared in every film that Marshall directed, beginning with his first feature film &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot;. Elizondo once noted that he is written into all of Marshall&#x27;s contracts whether he wanted to do the film or not. In the opening credits of &quot;Exit to Eden&quot;, their eighth film together, Elizondo is credited &quot;As Usual ... Hector Elizondo&quot;. In 1984, Marshall had a film hit as the writer and director of &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot;. Of all Marshall&#x27;s films, Elizondo had his biggest role in &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; as main character Matt Dillon&#x27;s father. 

Marshall had several responsibilities during this period of his career: most of his hit television series were created and executive produced by him. His first producing assignment came with &quot;Hey, Landlord&quot; in 1966. He stepped up the next year, producing &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Then came successes in producing &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Blansky&#x27;s Beauties&quot;, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;Angie&quot;, and &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

One such project titled &quot;Four Stars&quot; was directed by Lynda Goodfriend (who portrayed Lori Beth in &quot;Happy Days&quot;), and was based on a play Goodfriend had read when she was studying at the Lee Strasberg Center, which had been written by John Schulte and Kevin Mahoney. It starred Julie Paris (the daughter of Jerry Paris) and Bert Kramer. Schulte later co-wrote with TV veteran writer and producer Fred Fox Jr., who penned and produced a number of Marshall&#x27;s television series, including &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. Marshall went on to focus on directing feature films, with a series of hits, such as &quot;Beaches&quot;, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;.

Marshall was also an actor, appearing in &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; and in such films as &quot;Soapdish&quot;, &quot;On the Lot&quot;, his sister&#x27;s &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and Albert Brooks&#x27; &quot;Lost in America&quot;, and provided a guest-starring voice for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Eight Misbehavin&#x27; and &quot;Homer the Father&quot; (one of his first roles as an undercover cop in the counter-culture drama Psych-Out starring Jack Nicholson). He appeared in two episodes of &quot;Happy Days&quot; as a drummer. He was a drummer in the second last scene of &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; and he plays a drummer in his film &quot;Overboard&quot;.

His theater credits included &quot;Wrong Turn at Lungfish&quot;, which he wrote in collaboration with Lowell Ganz, &quot;The Roast&quot; with Jerry Belson, &quot;Shelves&quot; and &quot;Happy Days: A New Musical&quot; with Paul Williams, which had its premiere at the Falcon Theater in Burbank, California, February 24, 2006. He portrayed the role of &quot;director&quot; on Burbank&#x27;s &quot;Lights... camera... action!&quot; float in the 2014 Rose Parade. In 2014, Marshall appeared in a guest star role in a February episode in season 11 of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

==Death and tributes==
Marshall died at a hospital in Burbank, California, on the morning of July 19, 2016, due to complications of pneumonia after suffering a stroke. He was 81.

Henry Winkler paid tribute to him on &quot;Barry&quot; in 2019, and SAG-AFTRA made a Memoriam Tribute to Marshall on the SAG Awards in 2019. Julia Roberts paid tribute to him in &quot;Pretty Woman: The Musical&quot; in 2018. She also paid tribute to him in an interview: &quot;To know Garry Marshall was to love him. And I was luckier than most to have loved him for my entire adult life and luckier still to have been loved by him because his love was unconditional, inexhaustible and magical.&quot;

ABC aired the special &quot;The Happy Days of Garry Marshall&quot; on May 12, 2020.

<text>Thomas William Wappel (born February 9, 1950) is a Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member of the House of Commons from 1988 to 2008, representing the Toronto riding of Scarborough West and its successor riding of Scarborough Southwest. He did not seek re-election in the 2008 general election.

Wappel is a staunch social conservative. He is a prominent opponent of abortion and gay rights, and has made controversial comments on immigration and the role of religion in government. He opposes the death penalty and describes himself as holding liberal views on economic issues. In 1998, he was awarded the Joseph P. Borowski Award. He is separated, with five children.

==Early life and career==
Wappel was born in Toronto, to Hungarian parents. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto (1971), and a Bachelor of Laws from Queen&#x27;s University (1974). He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1976 and worked in civil litigation and corporate law. Wappel is a member of the Knights of Columbus.

==1988 election==

Wappel won the Scarborough West Liberal nomination in 1988 in a surprising upset over Patrick Johnston, a star candidate who had been personally recruited by party leader John Turner. His campaign was supported by members of the anti-abortion group Campaign Life, and his election platform included a pledge of &quot;respect for human life, from conception to the natural end of life&quot;. He also opposed the Canada-United States free trade agreement, and criticized the media for portraying him as a single-issue candidate. He won a narrow victory in the general election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Reginald Stackhouse by 440 votes.

During the election, Campaign Life activists circulated a pamphlet that accused Stackhouse of supporting &quot;baby-killing&quot; in some circumstances. There is no evidence that Wappel personally endorsed the pamphlet.

The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in 1988, and Wappel entered Parliament as a member of the opposition. John Turner resigned as party leader in 1989, and a new leadership contest was called to select his replacement.

==Leadership candidate==

Wappel was the first declared candidate in the Liberal Party&#x27;s 1990 leadership convention, announcing his candidacy on June 29, 1989. He described himself as the only candidate willing to make abortion a leadership issue. Wappel spoke against abortion in all circumstances, saying that while rape and incest are terrible tragedies, &quot;they cannot possibly be compounded by the further tragedy of destroying human life.&quot; He also called for increased immigration to Canada and harsher penalties against drug traffickers, while opposing the Meech Lake Accord and &quot;distinct society&quot; status for Quebec.

Wappel spoke against federal daycare programs during one all-candidates meeting, arguing that the Canadian government should promote stay-at-home parenting instead. Late in the campaign, he said that he did not consider single-parent households or same-sex couples to be families.

His candidacy was not supported by any other MPs although he won the endorsement of Liberals for Life, an anti-abortion pressure group working inside the Liberal Party, in March 1990. During his nomination speech at the convention, Wappel called for abortion to be made a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. He finished in fourth place, as Jean Chrétien won the leadership on the first ballot.

==Opposition Critic==
Wappel was appointed as the Liberal Party&#x27;s immigration critic in January 1991. Late in the year, he prepared an internal party document calling for the creation of detainment camps (to be called Welcome Centres) for refugees arriving in Canada. Claimants would be provided with food, lodging and clothing, but would not be permitted to work outside the centre while their cases were under review. The proposal also called for any claimant with HIV to be automatically denied status. His suggestions were leaked to the media and were immediately rejected by the Liberal Party leadership. He was removed as the Liberal Party&#x27;s immigration Critic in January 1992 and reassigned as critic for the Solicitor-General. In his new position, he called for increased safeguards in Canada&#x27;s parole system.

Wappel was endorsed by the Canadian Police Association in the 1993 federal election, and focused his campaign on &quot;law and order&quot; issues. He was easily re-elected as the Liberals won a majority government nationally.

==Government backbencher==

;Chrétien government

Wappel was not appointed to Jean Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet and was a frequent critic of his own party&#x27;s social legislation. He opposed the Chrétien government&#x27;s decision to extend anti-discrimination protection to homosexuals in 1994, describing homosexuality as &quot;statistically abnormal, [...] physically abnormal and [...] morally immoral&quot;. Some politicians and journalists called for Chrétien to expel Wappel from caucus after this remark, but no disciplinary action was taken. Later in the year, Wappel described homosexuality as &quot;not genetic, but a choice&quot;, while arguing that religion is &quot;virtually genetic, since it is passed from generation to generation&quot;. He remained active on law enforcement issues, introducing a private member&#x27;s bill to create a national witness protection program and calling for tougher provisions under Canada&#x27;s Young Offenders Act.

He was re-elected to a third term in the 1997 election, again running on a &quot;law and order&quot; platform. When parliament resumed, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill designed to prevent persons convicted of serious crimes (and their relatives and collaborators) from receiving any financial benefit resulting from artistic depictions of their acts. The bill was supported by some members of the law enforcement community, but was criticized by artists and was often described as poorly drafted. Toronto journalist Michael Valpy dismissed it as &quot;legal gibberish&quot; and &quot;a piece of junk&quot;. The bill passed the House of Commons but was rejected by the Senate of Canada in 1998, despite last-minute adjustments.

Wappel ran for Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada in 2001, seeking support from backbench Liberals and opposition members. He was eliminated after the first ballot of a secret vote by all members of Parliament (MPs).

He faced media scrutiny in May 2001, when he refused to help a blind, elderly veteran in his riding whom he suspected of having voted for a rival candidate in the previous election. Wappel wrote a letter to the constituent, asking &quot;How is it that you are writing me for my help if you did not think enough of my abilities to justify voting for me?&quot; The letter was released to the media, and Wappel&#x27;s remarks were widely condemned by journalists and MPs from all parties. Chrétien reprimanded Wappel and required him to issue an apology. Wappel later described the letter as a &quot;stupid mistake&quot;, and called for voters to forgive him.

In July 2002, Wappel joined with fifteen other Liberal MPs in calling for Paul Martin to succeed Jean Chrétien as Liberal leader. Later in the year, he was unexpectedly elected chair of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans in a free vote of other committee members. He issued a report in June 2003 arguing that federal bureaucrats had &quot;badly managed&quot; the sockeye salmon fishery in British Columbia&#x27;s Fraser River two years earlier.

;Martin government

Paul Martin succeeded Chrétien as party leader and prime minister in December 2003. Wappel remained a government backbencher, and was returned to a fifth parliamentary term in the 2004 election as the Liberals were reduced to a minority government.

Wappel remained one of the most vocal social conservatives in the Liberal caucus and was a prominent opponent of the Martin government&#x27;s 2005 same-sex marriage legislation, which he described as &quot;discriminatory, a sham, and a hoax&quot;. According to one report, Wappel told Martin that he was &quot;profoundly disappointed&quot; with his handling of the issue during a private caucus meeting. There was some speculation that Wappel would join fellow MP Pat O&#x27;Brien in leaving the Liberal caucus over the marriage bill, but he decided to remain in the party.

==Opposition MP==

Wappel was re-elected to the House of Commons in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservative Party won a national minority government. Wappel was one of twenty-four Liberal MPs to vote for an extension of Canada&#x27;s military mission in Afghanistan in May 2006. He also renewed his call for abortion legislation, describing Canada as &quot;the only western democracy that has absolutely no law whatsoever when it comes to protecting the unborn child&quot;. In February 2007, he was the only Liberal MP to vote for the extension of two controversial anti-terrorism measures that had first been passed by the Chrétien government in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The measures, which critics described as a threat to civil liberties, were defeated when the Bloc Québécois, New Democratic Party and most Liberals voted not to support their extension. Wappel expressed surprise that more Liberal MPs did not support the extension.

Wappel did not endorse any candidate in the 2006 Liberal leadership election, as none of the candidates were declared social conservatives. He indicated that he would personally vote for Joe Volpe at the convention.

==Food labels==

Wappel promoted several private member&#x27;s bills calling for better nutritional labels on food products. In 1998, he introduced a bill that would have required nutritional labels on all foods sold in grocery stores. It was supported by the Alliance for Food Label Reform, and Wappel argued that it would help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer among consumers. The bill was not passed.

In 2004, he introduced a separate bill requiring fast food restaurants to list salt and fat content on their menus. It was defeated by a vote of 198 to 64 in November 2006.

==Retirement==

On March 23, 2007, Wappel announced that he would not stand in the next federal election. His tenure as a member of Parliament ended with the 2008 federal election.

Wappel joined the Campaign Life Coalition as its legal counsel on January 1, 2009.

<doc id="543276" wikidata="Q1455870" url="?curid=543276" title="Beaches (1988 film)">
<text>Beaches is a 1988 American musical comedy drama film based on the 1985 novel of the same name by Iris Rainer Dart. It was directed by Garry Marshall from a screenplay by Mary Agnes Donoghue, and stars Bette Midler, Barbara Hershey, Mayim Bialik, John Heard, James Read, Spalding Gray, and Lainie Kazan.

Depending on the region, the film also goes by titles such as Forever Friends, Remember Me (alternately), Throughout Life (France), Girlfriends (German), The Friends (Greece &amp; Denmark), Eternally Friends (Spanish), On the Beach (Russia), Deeper Love Than Sisters (Taiwan), and Song on the Beach (Turkey).

==Plot==
Cecilia Carol &quot;C.C.&quot; Bloom, a New York actress and singer, receives a note during a concert rehearsal in Los Angeles and hurriedly leaves to be with her friend Hillary Whitney, a San Francisco heiress and lawyer. She drives overnight and reflects on their lifelong friendship.

They met in 1958 under the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Hillary is lost and C.C. is hiding from her stage mother Leona. They become close pen-friends; Hillary becomes a human rights lawyer, but C.C.&#x27;s singing career falters. Hillary shows up at the dive bar where C.C. is performing, their first meeting since Atlantic City. She moves in with C.C. and starts work with the ACLU. C.C. finally lands work from John Pierce, a theatrical director.

The two women&#x27;s friendship is put to the test by various romantic relationships, but always eventually survives these upheavals. Finally, C.C. makes it as a Broadway star. Hillary appears with her new man, Michael Essex, but there is new friction: C.C. castigates Hillary for forsaking the law; Hillary tells C.C. she&#x27;s obsessed with her career. The two women&#x27;s friendship seems to have ended.

They both end up getting divorces, but discover that they have been secretly jealous of each other for years: Hillary of C.C.&#x27;s talent; C.C. of Hillary&#x27;s intelligence.

Hillary tells C.C. that she is pregnant, and has already decided to raise the child as a single parent. This wins her admiration from the feisty and independent C.C., who promises to stay and help her out. C.C. starts talking of settling down, and having a family of her own, having become engaged to Hillary&#x27;s obstetrician, Richard Milstein. However, when C.C.&#x27;s agent calls with the perfect comeback gig for her, C.C. abandons her fiancé, and races back to New York City. Hillary gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Victoria Cecilia. When Victoria is a young girl, Hillary develops viral cardiomyopathy, requiring a heart transplant. Having a rare tissue type, she realizes she will most likely die before a heart is found.

C.C. has become a big star, having won a Tony award, and completed her latest hit album. When she learns of Hillary&#x27;s illness, she accompanies Hillary and Victoria to the beach house for the summer. Hillary becomes depressed due to her debilitated state, and takes her frustration out on C.C. whom she sees having fun with and connecting with Victoria. Hillary eventually begins to accept her prognosis bravely, appreciating her time with Victoria and C.C. Hillary and Victoria return to San Francisco, while C.C. heads to Los Angeles for a concert. Hillary collapses and is found by her daughter, leading to the note C.C. receives that prompts her to leave her rehearsal. C.C. takes Hillary and Victoria to the beach house, where Hillary dies.

After the funeral, C.C. takes custody of Victoria, and the two console each other in their grief. C.C. goes forward with her concert and concludes it by singing &quot;The Glory of Love&quot;, the first song Hillary heard her sing 30 years ago; as the song ends, C.C. tearfully waves toward the sky in tribute to Hillary. After the show, she leaves hand-in-hand with Victoria and begins telling stories of when she first met her mother.

==Cast==
==Production==
The beach house scenes were filmed at cottage #13 in what is now the Crystal Cove Historic District in Crystal Cove State Park in California.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;, hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and won Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year in 1990.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film opened December 21, 1988 and grossed $215,865 in its first 6 days from 7 screens. It opened nationwide January 13, 1989 and grossed $5,160,258 during its first wide weekend and went on to gross a total of $57,041,866 in the United States and Canada.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS, Betamax and laserdisc by Touchstone Home Video on August 23, 1989, with a DVD release on August 13, 2002, followed by a special-edition DVD on April 26, 2005. The film was later released in High Definition Blu-ray format on November 6, 2012.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 42% based on 45 critic reviews, and an average rating of 5.1/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Not all great soundtracks make good movies, and &quot;Beaches&quot; lacks the wind beneath its wings.&quot; Critics almost unanimously found the film&#x27;s emotional moments to be unearned, calculated, and familiar to the point of being predictable. Roger Ebert assessed that &quot;&#x27;Beaches&#x27; lacks the spontaneity of life. This is a movie completely constructed out of other movies - out of cliches and archetypes that were old before most of the cast members were born.&quot; He found the problem was compounded by the film foreshadowing Hillary&#x27;s death right from the beginning, and gave it two and a half stars. Gene Siskel called it &quot;a much too mechanical tearjerker&quot; and criticized the slow pace, but acknowledged that he heard some sniffling among the audience and gave it two and a half stars. Jay Boyar noted in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, &quot;In advance publicity for &quot;Beaches&quot;, it has been routinely referred to as a &#x27;tear-jerker.&#x27; Though the term is sometimes used admiringly these days, doesn&#x27;t it actually mean that a movie has emotional scenes in which the emotion is somehow trumped-up or unearned? This is the sort of picture in which people slap each other as they take their marriage vows, suddenly develop life-threatening diseases, and, again, have violent confrontations whenever there&#x27;s a break in the action. Anything for a laugh, anything for a tear, and nothing much authentic.&quot; Similarly to Ebert, he called it &quot;a 1940s retread&quot;, noting its use of antiquated themes like the idea that a woman must choose between being a mother and having a career.

Dave Kehr likewise stated in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;&quot;Beaches&quot; struggles to update a 1940s formula&quot;, describing it as particularly derivative of the 1943 film &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;. He also felt the friendship between C.C. and Hillary to be implausible and lacking in genuine warmth, and commented that &quot;The cardinal rule of melodrama ... is that emotion must follow from situation. When that relationship is inverted, the result is sheer manipulation and blatantly false.&quot; He gave it two stars. Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the most shamelessly manipulative movie since they shot the dog in &quot;The Biscuit Eater&quot;.&quot; While opining that emotional manipulation isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, she felt the film had failed to capture what made the novel it is adapted from such an effective tearjerker, by neglecting the essence of C.C. and Hillary&#x27;s friendship and instead focusing on petty arguments between the two. However, she praised the performances of Midler and Hershey, and admitted that the film succeeded in making her cry.

Several critics remarked that the scenes of C.C. and Hillary&#x27;s childhood were more emotionally convincing and enjoyable than the rest of the film, with particular praise for Mayim Bialik&#x27;s performance. Midler&#x27;s numerous singing performances were also frequently cited as a strong point in a mostly weak film.

The film remained poorly regarded over later decades. In reviews for the 2017 remake, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;CNN Entertainment&quot; recalled the 1988 film as, respectively, &quot;a pastiche of 1950s tear-jerkers that was set, strangely and uncomfortably, in the 1970s and ’80s. ... a shamelessly retrograde and literal-minded soap opera with a veneer of fake feminism&quot; and &quot;a film that delivered a hit song and strong box-office results but is remembered mostly for its high schmaltz factor.&quot;

===Accolades===
Included on the soundtrack was Midler&#x27;s performance of &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;. The song won Grammys for Record of the Year and Song of the Year in 1990. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Albert Brenner and Garrett Lewis).

The song is recognized by American Film Institute in this list:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; – #44

==Adaptations==
===Television remake===

Lifetime announced a remake of the film, which aired on January 22, 2017. The updated version was directed by Allison Anders with the script by Bart Barker and Nikole Beckwith, and Idina Menzel plays the role of C.C. Nia Long plays the role of Hillary alongside Menzel. The film includes the songs &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; and &quot;The Glory of Love&quot;.

===Stage adaptation===
A musical stage adaptation has been written, based on the book by Iris Rainer Dart, with lyrics and book by Dart and Thom Thomas (book) and music by David Austin. The musical premiered at the Signature Theatre, Arlington, Virginia in February 2014. The musical was directed by Eric D. Schaeffer, with Alysha Umphress as Cee Cee Bloom and Mara Davi as Bertie White.

The musical next opened at the Drury Lane Theatre, Oakbrook, Illinois, in June 2015 (previews). Again directed by Schaeffer, Shoshana Bean plays Cee Cee and Whitney Bashor plays Bertie. The choreographer is Lorin Latarro, with scenic design by Derek McLane, lighting design by Howell Binkley, costume design by Alejo Vietti and sound design by Kai Harada.

== Cancelled sequel ==
