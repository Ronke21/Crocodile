<text>The Berkeley Pit is a former open pit copper mine in the western United States, located in Butte, Montana. It is long by wide, with an approximate maximum depth of . It is filled to a depth of about with water that is acidic (4.1 - 4.5 pH level), about the acidity of beer or tomatoes. As a result, the pit&#x27;s water is laden with heavy metals and dissolved metals that leach from the rock in a natural process known as acid rock drainage. The dissolved metals include but are not limited to copper, arsenic, cadmium, zinc, and sulfuric acid.

The mine was opened in 1955 and operated by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and later by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), until its closure on April 22, 1982. When the pit was closed, the water pumps in the nearby Kelley Mine, below the surface, were turned off, and groundwater began to slowly fill the Berkeley Pit, rising at about the rate of per month. Since its closure, the water level in the pit has risen to within of the &quot;protective water level&quot;, above which the polluted water might flow into a nearby creek and other local water sources. As a result, a water treatment plant has been operating at the site since October 2019.

The Berkeley Pit can be visited by tourists, with a viewing stand and small visitor center.

==History==
The underground Berkeley Mine was located on a prominent vein extending to the southeast from the main Anaconda vein system (sometimes called &quot;the richest hill on earth&quot;). When open pit mining operations began in July 1955, near the Berkeley Mine shaft, the older mine gave its name to the pit. The open-pit style of mining superseded underground operations because it was far more economical and much less dangerous than underground mining.

Within the first year of operation, the pit extracted 17,000 tons of ore per day at a grade of 0.75% copper. Ultimately, about 1,000,000,000 tons of material were mined from the Berkeley Pit. Copper was the principal metal produced, although other metals were also extracted, including silver and gold.

Two communities and much of Butte&#x27;s previously crowded east side were consumed by land purchases to expand the pit during the 1970s. The Anaconda Company bought the homes, businesses and schools of the working-class communities of Meaderville, East Butte, and McQueen, east of the pit site. Many of these homes were either destroyed, buried, or moved to the southern end of Butte. Residents were compensated at market value for their acquired property.

== Pollution, toxicity, and cleanup ==
The Berkeley Pit is located within the Butte Mine Flooding Operable Unit, a part of the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site. The pit itself was added to the federal Superfund site list in 1987. 

=== Water ===
The Berkeley Pit is a low spot and acts like a sump for contaminated water. For this reason, it is currently an active part of the remedy for this operable unit. A pilot water treatment project was initiated in 2019. It began treating and releasing Berkeley Pit water into Silver Bow Creek at the confluence with Blacktail Creek. This was done to protect the local groundwater from eventually becoming contaminated by rising pit water. The plant cost $19 million and was designed to treat ten million gallons of water per day.

=== Waterfowl ===
In 1996, 342 snow geese carcasses were recovered from the pit by researchers performing water quality testing. ARCO, the custodian of the pit, denied that the toxic water caused the death of the geese, attributing the deaths to an acute aspergillosis infection that may have been caused by a grain fungus, as substantiated by necropsy findings from Colorado State University. These findings were disputed by the State of Montana on the basis of its own lab tests. Necropsies showed their esophagi were lined with burns and sores from exposure to acidic metalliferous water. As a result, waterfowl protection efforts were initiated. 

On November 28, 2016, upwards of 60,000 snow geese landed in the pit during inclement weather. Once discovered, officials made efforts to haze the birds off of the pit&#x27;s water and prevent more from landing in the area. Three to four thousand of the geese died. An official report issued in 2017 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the dead geese succumbed due to drinking the acidic metalliferous water.

After this event, Atlantic Richfield (AR) and Montana Resources (MR) further enhanced the waterfowl protection efforts which had been in place since 1996. A new Waterfowl Protection Plan was developed and allowed for adaptive management, testing, and incorporation new tools and techniques. Deterrents such as Phoenix Wailers, a type of noise machine, and propane cannons that mimic gunshots are placed around the rim of the pit to keep birds from landing. When waterfowl do land on the surface of the pit, personnel use firearms, hand-held lasers, and unmanned craft to haze them.
===Protozoans===

A protozoan species, &quot;Euglena mutabilis&quot;, was found to reside in the pit by Andrea A. Stierle and Donald B. Stierle, and the protozoans have been found to have adapted to the harsh conditions of the water. Intense competition for the limited resources caused these species to evolve the production of highly toxic compounds to improve survivability. Natural products such as berkeleydione, berkeleytrione, and berkelic acid have been isolated from these organisms which show selective activity against cancer cell lines. Some of these species ingest metals and are being investigated as an alternative means of cleaning the water.

===Important dates===

*1994 – September, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/DEQ issue Record of Decision (ROD) for Butte Mine Flooding Operable Unit. 
*1996 – April, Montana Resources (MR) and ARCO divert Horseshoe Bend (HSB) drainage water away from Berkeley Pit to slow filling rate, per ROD. 
*2000 – July, MR suspends mining operations due to high energy costs; HSB water allowed to flow back into pit, increasing pit filling rate. 
*2002 – March, US EPA and Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) enter into a Consent Decree with BP/ARCO and the Montana Resources Group (known as the Settling Defendants) for settlement of past and future costs for this site. 
*2002 (mid/late) – US EPA and MDEQ issue order for Settling Defendants to begin design of water treatment plant for HSB water. Settling Defendants issue contract and begin construction of treatment plant. 
*2003 – November, MR resumes mining operations.
*2003 – November 17, HSB water treatment plant comes on line slowing pit filling rate.

==Geology==
The mine is at an altitude of 4,698 feet (1432 m) above mean sea level. According to the Record of Decision, the pit water level is not to exceed 5,410 feet above sea level.

The Butte mining district is characterized by the Late Cretaceous boulder batholith which metamorphosed surrounding rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Ore formation occurred with the intrusion of the Butte quartz monzonite pluton. Mining of sulfide minerals began in the district in 1864. Placer deposits were mined out by 1867. Silver vein lodes were then the most productive until copper was discovered in 1881. Open-pit mining started in 1955. Copper has historically been the main metal produced, though lead, zinc, manganese, silver and gold have been produced at various times.

<text>Cathy Lee Guisewite (born September 5, 1950) is an American cartoonist who created the comic strip &quot;Cathy&quot;, which had a 34-year run. The strip focused on a career woman facing the issues and challenges of eating, work, relationships, and having a mother—or as the character put it in one strip, &quot;the four basic guilt groups.&quot;

==Early life==
Guisewite was born in Dayton, Ohio, to William L. and Anne Guisewite. She was raised in Midland, Michigan, with older sister Mary Anne Nagy and younger sister Mickey. Guisewite graduated from Midland High School in 1968.

She attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. In 1972, she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English.

==Career==
After college, Guisewite followed her father&#x27;s vocation and began working in advertising at Campbell-Ewald, then Norman Prady, and settled at W.B. Doner &amp; Co. near Detroit. She became a vice president of the firm in 1976.
She continued to draw funny pictures as an &quot;emotional coping mechanism&quot; to events in her life and work, and she would forward them to her parents. Her mother kept urging her to send them to a publisher, so she did. &quot;My entire goal with my submission package was to get my mother off my back. My goal was not to do a comic strip. It was to make Mom quit telling me I could do a comic strip.&quot;

Guisewite was flabbergasted when the company sent her a contract to produce a comic strip. &quot;Cathy&quot; was syndicated to 66 newspapers in 1976 by Universal Press Syndicate, now Universal Uclick, and Guisewite did both—her advertising job during the day, and comics at night. By 1980, the strip was carried by 150 dailies, she was earning $50,000 per year for &quot;Cathy&quot;, she quit the advertising business to work on &quot;Cathy&quot; full-time, and she moved to Santa Barbara, California.

The comic strip was a &quot;running social commentary&quot; for her confusion. Guisewite explained, &quot;You were a liberated woman or you were a traditionalist. To even voice vulnerability if you were a feminist was wrong and to voice interest in liberation if you were a more traditional woman was wrong. So I believe the women I was speaking to in the early years of my strip were women like me, who were at that age in our 20s where we were kind of launched into adulthood with a foot in both worlds and no way to really express it.”

Guisewite appeared several times as a guest on the late night TV series &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

At the peak of the strip&#x27;s popularity in the mid-1990s, it appeared in almost 1,400 papers. However, on August 11, 2010, Guisewite announced the strip&#x27;s retirement after 34 years. Its run ended on October 3, 2010 (a Sunday strip).

==Awards==
In 1987, she received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for the TV special &quot;Cathy&quot;.

Guisewite is a member of the National Cartoonists Society and received in 1993 its highest honor, the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, for her work in 1992.

Guisewite has been granted honorary degrees from Russell Sage College, Rhode Island College, and Eastern Michigan University.

==Personal life==
Guisewite adopted daughter Ivy in 1992, then married screenwriter Christopher Wilkinson in 1997. Wilkinson has a son, Cooper, but the couple had no children together. Guisewite and Wilkinson divorced in 2010.

<text>Riftia pachyptila, commonly known as the giant tube worm and less commonly known as the giant beardworm, is a marine invertebrate in the phylum Annelida (formerly grouped in phylum Pogonophora and Vestimentifera) related to tube worms commonly found in the intertidal and pelagic zones. &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; lives on the floor of the Pacific Ocean near hydrothermal vents. The vents provide a natural ambient temperature in their environment ranging from 2 to 30 °C, and this organism can tolerate extremely high hydrogen sulfide levels. These worms can reach a length of , and their tubular bodies have a diameter of .

Its common name &quot;giant tube worm&quot; is, however, also applied to the largest living species of shipworm, &quot;Kuphus polythalamius&quot;, which despite the name &quot;worm&quot;, is a bivalve mollusc rather than an annelid.

==Discovery==

&quot;R. pachyptila&quot; was discovered in 1977 on an expedition of the American bathyscaphe DSV &quot;Alvin&quot; to the Galápagos Rift led by geologist Jack Corliss. The discovery was unexpected, as the team was studying hydrothermal vents and no biologists were included in the expedition. Many of the species found living near hydrothermal vents during this expedition had never been seen before.

At the time, the presence of thermal springs near the midoceanic ridges was known. Further research uncovered aquatic life in the area, despite the high temperature (around 350–380 °C).

Many samples were collected, including bivalves, polychaetes, large crabs, and &quot;R. pachyptila&quot;. It was the first time that species was observed.

==Development==
&quot;R. pachyptila&quot; develops from a free-swimming, pelagic, nonsymbiotic trochophore larva, which enters juvenile (metatrochophore) development, becoming sessile, and subsequently acquiring symbiotic bacteria. The symbiotic bacteria, on which adult worms depend for sustenance, are not present in the gametes, but are acquired from the environment through the skin in a process akin to an infection. The digestive tract transiently connects from a mouth at the tip of the ventral medial process to a foregut, midgut, hindgut, and anus and was previously thought to have been the method by which the bacteria are introduced into adults. After symbionts are established in the midgut, they undergo substantial remodelling and enlargement to become the trophosome, while the remainder of the digestive tract has not been detected in adult specimens.

==Body structure==
Isolating the vermiform body from white chitinous tube, a small difference exists from the classic three subdivisions typical of phylum Pogonophora: the prosoma, the mesosoma, and the metasoma.
The first body region is the branchial plume, which is bright red due to the presence of hemoglobin that contain up to 144 globin chains (each presumably including associated heme structures). These tube worm hemoglobins are remarkable for carrying oxygen in the presence of sulfide, without being inhibited by this molecule, as hemoglobins in most other species are. The plume provides essential nutrients to bacteria living inside the trophosome. If the animal perceives a threat or is touched, it retracts the plume and the tube is closed due to the obturaculum, a particular operculum that protects and isolates the animal from the external environment.

The second body region is the vestimentum, formed by muscle bands, having a winged shape, and it presents the two genital openings at the end. The heart, extended portion of dorsal vessel, enclose the vestimentum.
In the middle part, the trunk or third body region, is full of vascularized solid tissue, and includes body wall, gonads, and the coelomic cavity. Here is located also the trophosome, spongy tissue where a billion symbiotic, thioautotrophic bacteria and sulfur granules are found. Since the mouth, digestive system, and anus are missing, the survival of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is dependent on this mutualistic symbiosis. This process, known as chemosynthesis, was recognized within the trophosome by Colleen Cavanaugh.

The soluble hemoglobins, present in the tentacles, are able to bind O2 and H2S, which are necessary for chemosynthetic bacteria. Due to the capillaries, these compounds are absorbed by bacteria. During the chemosynthesis, the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanase catalyzes the disproportionation reaction of the thiosulfate anion S2O32- to sulfur S and sulfite SO32- . The &quot;R. pachyptila&quot;’s bloodstream is responsible for absorption of the O2 and nutrients such as carbohydrates.

Nitrate and nitrite are toxic, but are required for biosynthetic processes. The chemosynthetic bacteria within the trophosome convert nitrate to ammonium ions, which then are available for production of amino acids in the bacteria, which are in turn released to the tube worm. To transport nitrate to the bacteria, &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; concentrates nitrate in its blood, to a concentration 100 times more concentrated than the surrounding water. The exact mechanism of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot;’s ability to withstand and concentrate nitrate is still unknown.

In the posterior part, the fourth body region, is the opistosome, which anchors the animal to the tube and is used for the storage of waste from bacterial reactions.

== Symbiosis ==
The discovery of bacterial invertebrate chemoautotrophic symbiosis, particularly in vestimentiferan tubeworms &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; and then in vesicomyid clams and mytilid mussels revealed the chemoautotrophic potential of the hydrothermal vent tube worm. Scientists discovered a remarkable source of nutrition that helps to sustain the conspicuous biomass of invertebrates at vents. Many studies focusing on this type of symbiosis revealed the presence of chemoautotrophic, endosymbiotic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria mainly in &quot;R. pachyptila&quot;, which inhabits extreme environments and is adapted to the particular composition of the mixed volcanic and sea waters. This special environment is filled with inorganic metabolites, essentially carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. In its adult phase, &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; lacks a digestive system. To provide its energetic needs, it retains those dissolved inorganic nutrients (sulfide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen) into its plume and transports them through a vascular system to the trophosome, which is suspended in paired coelomic cavities and is where the intracellular symbiotic bacteria are found. The trophosome is a soft tissue that runs through almost the whole length of the tube&#x27;s coelom. It retains a large number of bacteria on the order of 109 bacteria per gram of fresh weight. Bacteria in the trophosome are retained inside bacteriocytes, thereby having no contact with the external environment. Thus, they rely on &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; for the assimilation of nutrients needed for the array of metabolic reactions they employ and for the excretion of waste products of carbon fixation pathways. At the same time, the tube worm depends completely on the microorganisms for the byproducts of their carbon fixation cycles that are needed for its growth.

Initial evidence for a chemoautotrophic symbiosis in &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; came from microscopic and biochemical analyses showing Gram-negative bacteria packed within a highly vascularized organ in the tubeworm trunk called the trophosome. Additional analyses involving stable isotope, enzymatic, and physiological characterizations confirmed that the end symbionts of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; oxidize reduced-sulfur compounds to synthesize ATP for use in autotrophic carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle. The host tubeworm enables the uptake and transport of the substrates required for thioautotrophy, which are HS−, O2, and CO2, receiving back a portion of the organic matter synthesized by the symbiont population. The adult tubeworm, given its inability to feed on particulate matter and its entire dependency on its symbionts for nutrition, the bacterial population is then the primary source of carbon acquisition for the symbiosis. Discovery of bacterial–invertebrate chemoautotrophic symbioses, initially in vestimentiferan tubeworms and then in vesicomyid clams and mytilid mussels, pointed to an even more remarkable source of nutrition sustaining the invertebrates at vents.

== Endosymbiosis with chemoautotrophic bacteria ==
A wide range of bacterial diversity is associated with symbiotic relationships with &quot;R. pachyptila&quot;. Many bacteria belong to the phylum Campylobacterota (formerly class Epsilonproteobacteria) as supported by the recent discovery in 2016 of the new species &quot;Sulfurovum riftiae&quot; belonging to the phylum Campylobacterota, family Helicobacteraceae isolated from &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; collected from the East Pacific Rise. Other symbionts belong to the class Delta-, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. The &quot;Candidatus&quot; Endoriftia persephone (Gammaproteobacteria) is a facultative &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; symbiont and has been shown to be a mixotroph, thereby exploiting both Calvin Benson cycle and reverse TCA cycle (with an unusual ATP citrate lyase) according to availability of carbon resources and whether it is free living in the environment or inside a eukaryotic host. The bacteria apparently prefer a heterotrophic lifestyle when carbon sources are available.

Evidence based on 16S rRNA analysis affirms that &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; chemoautotrophic bacteria belong to two different clades: Gammaproteobacteria and Campylobacterota (e.g. &quot;Sulfurovum riftiae&quot;) that get energy from the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S, HS−, S2-) to synthesize ATP for carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle. Unfortunately, most of these bacteria are still uncultivable. Symbiosis works so that &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; provides nutrients such as HS−, O2, CO2 to bacteria, and in turn it receives organic matter from them. Thus, because of lack of a digestive system, &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; depends entirely on its bacterial symbiont to survive.

In the first step of sulfide-oxidation, reduced sulfur (HS−) passes from the external environment into &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; blood, where, together with O2, it is bound by hemoglobin, forming the complex Hb-O2-HS− and then it is transported to the trophosome, where bacterial symbionts reside. Here, HS− is oxidized to elemental sulfur (S0) or to sulfite (SO32-).

In the second step, the symbionts make sulfite-oxidation by the &quot;APS pathway&quot;, to get ATP. In this biochemical pathway, AMP reacts with sulfite in the presence of the enzyme APS reductase, giving APS (adenosine 5&#x27;-phosphosulfate). Then, APS reacts with the enzyme ATP sulfurylase in presence of pyrophosphate (PPi) giving ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation) and sulfate (SO42-) as end products. In formulas:

* &lt;chem&gt;AMP + SO3^2- -&gt;[APSreductase] APS&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;APS + PPi -&gt;[ATP sulfurylase] ATP + SO4^2-&lt;/chem&gt;

The electrons released during the entire sulfide-oxidation process enter in an electron transport chain, yielding a proton gradient that produces ATP (oxidative phosphorylation). Thus, ATP generated from oxidative phosphorylation and ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation become available for CO2 fixation in Calvin cycle, whose presence has been demonstrated by the presence of two key enzymes of this pathway: phosphoribulokinase and RubisCO.

To support this unusual metabolism, &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; has to absorb all the substances necessary for both sulfide-oxidation and carbon fixation, that is: HS−, O2 and CO2 and other fundamental bacterial nutrients such as N and P. This means that the tubeworm must be able to access both oxic and anoxic areas.

Oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds requires the presence of oxidized reagents such as oxygen and nitrate. Hydrothermal vents are characterized by conditions of high hypoxia. In hypoxic conditions, sulfur-storing organisms start producing hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the production of in H2S in anaerobic conditions is common among thiotrophic symbiosis. H2S can be damaging for some physiological processes as it inhibits the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, consequentially impairing oxidative phosphorylation. In &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; the production of hydrogen sulfide starts after 24h of hypoxia. In order to avoid physiological damage some animals, including &quot;Riftia&quot; &quot;pachyptila&quot; are able to bind H2S to haemoglobin in the blood to eventually expel it in the surrounding environment.

== Carbon fixation and organic carbon assimilation ==
Unlike metazoans, which respire carbon dioxide as a waste product, &quot;R. pachyptila&quot;-symbiont association has a demand for a net uptake of CO2 instead, as a cnidarian-symbiont associations.

Ambient deep-sea water contains an abundant amount of inorganic carbon in the form of bicarbonate HCO3−, but it is actually the chargeless form of inorganic carbon, CO2, that is easily diffusible across membranes. The low partial pressures of CO2 in the deep-sea environment is due to the seawater alkaline pH and the high solubility of CO2, yet the pCO2 of the blood of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; may be as much as two orders of magnitude greater than the pCO2 of deep-sea water.

CO2 partial pressures are transferred to the vicinity of vent fluids due to the enriched inorganic carbon content of vent fluids and their lower pH. CO2 uptake in the worm is enhanced by the higher pH of its blood (7.3–7.4), which favors the bicarbonate ion and thus promotes a steep gradient across which CO2 diffuses into the vascular blood of the plume. The facilitation of CO2 uptake by high environmental pCO2 was first inferred based on measures of elevated blood and coelomic fluid pCO2 in tubeworms, and was subsequently demonstrated through incubations of intact animals under various pCO2 conditions.

Once CO2 is fixed by the symbionts, it must be assimilated by the host tissues. The supply of fixed carbon to the host is transported via organic molecules from the trophosome in the hemolymph, but the relative importance of translocation and symbiont digestion is not yet known. Studies proved that within 15 min, the label first appears in symbiont-free host tissues, and that indicates a significant amount of release of organic carbon immediately after fixation. After 24 h, labeled carbon is clearly evident in the epidermal tissues of the body wall. Results of the pulse-chase autoradiographic experiments were also evident with ultrastructural evidence for digestion of symbionts in the peripheral regions of the trophosome lobules.

== Sulfide acquisition ==
In deep-sea hydrothermal vents, sulfide and oxygen are present in different areas. Indeed, the reducing fluid of hydrothermal vents is rich in sulfide, but poor in oxygen, whereas sea water is richer in dissolved oxygen. Moreover, sulfide is immediately oxidized by dissolved oxygen to form partly, or totally, oxidized sulfur compounds like thiosulfate (S2O32-) and ultimately sulfate (SO42-), respectively less, or no longer, usable for microbial oxidation metabolism. This causes the substrates to be less available for microbial activity, thus bacteria are constricted to compete with oxygen to get their nutrients. In order to avoid this issue, several microbes have evolved to make symbiosis with eukaryotic hosts. In fact, &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is able to cover the oxic and anoxic areas to get both sulfide and oxygen thanks to its hemoglobin that can bind sulfide reversibly and apart from oxygen by functional binding sites determined to be zinc ions embedded in the A2 chains of the hemoglobins. and then transport it to the trophosome, where bacterial metabolism can occur. It has also been suggested that cysteine residues are involved in this process.

== Symbiont acquisition ==
The acquisition of a symbiont by a host can occur in these ways:

*Environmental transfer (symbiont acquired from a free-living population in the environment)
* Vertical transfer (parents transfer symbiont to offspring via eggs)
* Horizontal transfer (hosts that share the same environment)

Evidence suggests that &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; acquires its symbionts through its environment. In fact, 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that vestimentiferan tubeworms belonging to three different genera: &quot;Riftia&quot;, &quot;Oasisia&quot;, and &quot;Tevnia&quot;, share the same bacterial symbiont phylotype.

This proves that &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; takes its symbionts from a free-living bacterial population in the environment. Other studies also support this thesis, because analyzing &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; eggs, 16S rRNA belonging to the symbiont was not found, showing that the bacterial symbiont is not transmitted by vertical transfer.

Another proof to support the environmental transfer comes from several studies conducted in the late 1990s. PCR was used to detect and identify a &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; symbiont gene whose sequence was very similar to the &quot;fliC&quot; gene that encodes some primary protein subunits (flagellin) required for flagellum synthesis. Analysis showed that &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; symbiont has at least one gene needed for flagellum synthesis. Hence, the question arose as to the purpose of the flagellum. Flagellar motility would be useless for a bacterial symbiont transmitted vertically, but if the symbiont came from the external environment, then a flagellum would be essential to reach the host organism and to colonize it. Indeed, several symbionts use this method to colonize eukaryotic hosts.

Thus, these results confirm the environmental transfer of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; symbiont.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is a dioecious vestimentiferan. Individuals of this species are sessile and are found clustered together around deep-sea hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos Rift. The size of a patch of individuals surrounding a vent is within the scale of tens of metres.

The male&#x27;s spermatozoa are thread-shaped and are composed of three distinct regions: the acrosome (6 μm), the nucleus (26 μm) and the tail (98 μm). Thus, the single spermatozoa is about 130 μm long overall, with a diameter of 0.7 μm, which becomes narrower near the tail area, reaching 0.2 μm. The sperm is arranged into an agglomeration of around 340–350 individual spermatozoa that create a torch-like shape. The cup part is made up of acrosomes and nucleus, while the handle is made up by the tails. The spermatozoa in the package are held together by fibrils. Fibrils also coat the package itself to ensure cohesion.

The large ovaries of females run within the gonocoel along the entire length of the trunk and are ventral to the trophosome. Eggs at different maturation stages can be found in the middle area of the ovaries, and depending on their developmental stage, are referred to as: oogonia, oocytes, and follicular cells. When the oocytes mature, they acquire protein and lipid yolk granules.

Males release their sperm into sea water. While the released agglomerations of spermatozoa, referred to as spermatozeugmata, do not remain intact for more than 30 seconds in laboratory conditions, they may maintain integrity for longer periods of time in specific hydrothermal vent conditions. Usually, the spermatozeugmata swim into the female&#x27;s tube. Movement of the cluster is conferred by the collective action of each spermatozoon moving independently. Reproduction has also been observed involving only a single spermatozoon reaching the female&#x27;s tube. Generally, fertilization in &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is considered internal. However, some argue that, as the sperm is released into sea water and only afterwards reaches the eggs in the oviducts, it should be defined as internal-external.

&quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is completely dependent on the production of volcanic gases and the presence of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Therefore, its metapopulation distribution is profoundly linked to volcanic and tectonic activity that create active hydrothermal vent sites with a patchy and ephemeral distribution. The distance between active sites along a rift or adjacent segments can be very high, reaching hundreds of km. This raises the question regarding larval dispersal. &quot;R. pachytpila&quot; is capable of larval dispersal across distances of 100 to 200 km and cultured larvae show to be viable for 38 days. Though dispersal is considered to be effective, the genetic variability observed in &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; metapopulation is low compared to other vent species. This may be due to high extinction events and colonization events, as &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is one of the first species to colonize a new active site.

The endosymbionts of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; are not passed to the fertilized eggs during spawning, but are acquired later during the larval stage of the vestimentiferan worm. &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; planktonic larvae that are transported through sea-bottom currents until they reach active hydrothermal vents sites, are referred to as trophocores. The trophocore stage lacks endosymbionts, which are acquired once larvae settle in a suitable environment and substrate. Free-living bacteria found in the water column are ingested randomly and enter the worm through a ciliated opening of the branchial plume. This opening is connected to the trophosome through a duct that passes through the brain. Once the bacteria are in the gut, the ones that are beneficial to the individual, namely sulfide- oxidizing strains are phaghocytized by epithelial cells found in the midgut are then retained. Bacteria that do not represent possible endosymbionts are digested. This raises questions as to how &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; manages to discern between essential and nonessential bacterial strains. The worm&#x27;s ability to recognise a beneficial strain, as well as preferential host-specific infection by bacteria have been both suggested as being the drivers of this phenomenon.

==Growth rate and age==
&quot;R. pachyptila&quot; has the fastest growth rate of any known marine invertebrate. These organisms have been known to colonize a new site, grow to sexual maturity, and increase in length to 4.9 feet (1.5 m) in less than two years.

Because of the peculiar environment in which &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; thrives, this species differs greatly from other deep-sea species that do not inhabit hydrothermal vents sites; the activity of diagnostic enzymes for glycolysis, citric acid cycle and transport of electrons in the tissues of &quot;R. pachyptila&quot; is very similar to the activity of these enzymes in the tissues of shallow-living animals. This contrasts with the fact that deep-sea species usually show very low metabolic rates, which in turn suggests that low water temperature and high pressure in the deep sea do not necessarily limit the metabolic rate of animals and that hydrothermal vents sites display characteristics that are completely different from the surrounding environment, thereby shaping the physiology and biological interactions of the organisms living in these sites.

<text>Oscar Verner Peterson (August 27, 1899 – May 13, 1942) was a Chief Petty Officer in the United States Navy who received the Medal of Honor posthumously in World War II for his actions during the Battle of the Coral Sea.

==Early life and career==
Peterson was born in Prentice, Wisconsin, and enlisted in the Navy on December 8, 1920. After his initial training, he spent his entire Navy career of over twenty years on sea duty aboard various ships. He and his wife Lola had two sons, Fred and Donald.

By the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, Peterson had achieved the rank of chief watertender. He was assigned to the , an oiler ship operating in the Pacific theater.

==Battle of the Coral Sea==
On May 7, 1942, during the Battle of the Coral Sea, the &quot;Neosho&quot; was heavily damaged by Japanese dive bombers. In one bombing raid, Peterson and members of the repair party he led were severely wounded. Despite his injuries, he managed to close four bulkhead steam line valves, but suffered third-degree burns to his face, shoulders, arms and hands in the process. By shutting the valves, Peterson isolated the steam to the engine room and helped keep the ship operational.

The &quot;Neosho&quot; was eventually scuttled on May 11 by gunfire from the destroyer &quot;USS Henley&quot;. The Henley had taken aboard 123 survivors from the &quot;Neosho&quot;. Peterson died of his burn injuries on May 13 and was buried at sea, several hundred miles off the coast of Australia.

For his actions during the battle, Peterson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor later that year, on December 7. For unknown reasons, his family did not receive his medal in a formal presentation ceremony as was typical. Instead, the medal and accompanying certificate were mailed to his widow.

Peterson&#x27;s official Medal of Honor citation reads:
&quot;For extraordinary courage and conspicuous heroism above and beyond the call of duty while in charge of a repair party during an attack on the U.S.S. &quot;Neosho&quot; by enemy Japanese aerial forces on 7 May 1942. Lacking assistance because of injuries to the other members of his repair party and severely wounded himself, Peterson, with no concern for his own life, closed the bulkhead stop valves and in so doing received additional burns which resulted in his death. His spirit of self-sacrifice and loyalty, characteristic of a fine seaman, was in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.&quot;

==Awards==
*Medal of Honor
*Purple Heart
*Good Conduct Medal
*American Defense Service Medal with &quot;FLEET&quot; clasp
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two battle stars
*World War II Victory Medal

==Legacy==
After Peterson&#x27;s death, his widow and children moved from California to Richfield, Idaho. His wife Lola died in 1991, and his son Donald in 2008. On April 3, 2010, sixty-eight years after the Battle of the Coral Sea, a Medal of Honor presentation ceremony was held to amend for the one Peterson&#x27;s wife never received. Rear Admiral James A. Symonds presented the medal and a forty-eight star U.S. flag to Peterson&#x27;s surviving son, Fred. The ceremony, held at the Richfield meetinghouse of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was attended by roughly 850 people, including family members, veterans, and officials from the military and Idaho state government. A military-issued memorial marker for Peterson was placed in Richfield Cemetery the same day.

The U.S. Navy destroyer escort was named in his honor.

<text>John Duncan MacLean (December 8, 1873 – March 28, 1948) was a teacher, physician, politician and the 20th premier of British Columbia, Canada.

MacLean was a practicing doctor in the city of Greenwood when he was elected in the 1916 election to the provincial legislature as a Liberal. He served as minister of education and provincial secretary in the cabinets of Harlan Carey Brewster and John Oliver before becoming minister of finance in 1924. In the election that year, he ran and won in the Yale riding. He also served as Minister of Industries between 1924 and 1928.

MacLean became premier when Oliver died in 1927 at a time when the Liberal government was in decline. He was unable to reverse his party&#x27;s fortunes, and was defeated in the 1928 election by the rival Conservatives. Later that year he attempted to enter the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election as a Liberal candidate, but was defeated by fewer than one hundred votes. He spent the rest of his life as chairman of the Canadian Farm Loan Board.

<text>The University of Dallas is a private Catholic university in Irving, Texas. Established in 1956, it is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

The university comprises three academic units: the Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts, the Constantin College of Liberal Arts, and the Satish &amp; Yasmin Gupta College of Business. Dallas offers several master&#x27;s degree programs and a doctoral degree program with three concentrations. As of 2017, there were 136 full-time faculty and 102 part-time faculty.

==History==
===20th century===
The University of Dallas&#x27; charter dates from 1910 when the Western Province of the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians) renamed Holy Trinity College in Dallas, which they had founded in 1905. The provincial of the Western Province closed the university in 1928, and the charter reverted to the Diocese of Dallas. In 1955, the Western Province of the Sisters of St. Mary of Namur obtained it to create a new higher education institution in Dallas that would subsume their junior college, Our Lady of Victory College, located in Fort Worth. The sisters, together with Eugene Constantin Jr. and Edward R. Maher Sr., petitioned the Diocese of Dallas to sponsor the university, though ownership was entrusted to a self-perpetuating independent board of trustees. The university opened with an initial class of ninety-six students in 1956.

The university&#x27;s character was intended to be unlike other Catholic universities in Texas. Bishop Thomas Gorman had plans to shape it in the manner of Louvain, the Catholic university in Belgium where he himself had studied and which was considered an elite institution in his day.

The Sisters of St. Mary of Namur, Cistercian monks, Franciscan friars, and several lay professors formed the university&#x27;s 1956 faculty. The Franciscans departed three years later; professors from the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) joined the faculty in 1958 and built St. Albert the Great Priory on campus. The Cistercians established Our Lady of Dallas Abbey in 1958 and Cistercian Preparatory School in 1962, which are both adjacent to campus. The School Sisters of Notre Dame arrived in 1962 and opened a school for children with learning difficulties in 1963 and a motherhouse for the Dallas Province in 1964, both on campus. The sisters moved the school to Dallas in 1985 and closed the motherhouse in 1987. The faculty is now almost exclusively lay.

Braniff Graduate School, the Graduate School of Management, and programs in art and English all began in 1966. In 1973, the Institute of Philosophic Studies, the doctoral program of the Braniff Graduate School and an outgrowth of the Kendall Politics and Literature Program, was initiated. The School of Ministry began in 1987. The College of Business, incorporating the Gupta Graduate School of Management and undergraduate business, opened in 2003.

Since the first class entered in 1960, university graduates have won 39 Fulbright awards.

Accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools came in 1963 and has been reaffirmed regularly. In 1989, it was the youngest institution of higher education ever to be awarded a Phi Beta Kappa chapter.

===21st century===
In 2013, the &quot;Princeton Review&quot; ranked the university as the 15th-most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States. 

Two years later, the university applied for an exception to Title IX allowing it to discriminate based on gender identity for religious reasons. The university &quot;cannot encourage individuals to live in conflict with Catholic principles,&quot; according to president Thomas Keefe. 

In 2016, the organization Campus Pride ranked the college among the worst schools in Texas for LGBT students.

President Thomas W. Keefe was hired from Benedictine University to serve as president. Like his predecessors, he quickly ran into controversy. 

In 2017, Keefe&#x27;s leadership was strongly and publicly challenged by over half the faculty and thousands of alumni members of an independent alumni group called UD Alumni for Liberal Education. Their complaint was over a proposal to add a new college within the university that it was believed would have low standards. 

After intense controversy and multiple efforts by trustees, on Good Friday of 2018, after Keefe&#x27;s extended and unexplained absence from work, the university&#x27;s trustees voted to fire him, effective at the end of the academic year.

=== Seal ===
The outer circle of the university&#x27;s seal is an alteration of verse 8:19 of the Book of Zechariah, &quot;Veritatem tantum et pacem diligite&quot;, which means &quot;Love truth and peace.&quot; The university&#x27;s motto replaces &quot;pacem&quot; with &quot;justitiam&quot;, and so may be translated as &quot;Love truth [and] justice.&quot; In the center of the seal is a Triquetra interwoven with a triangle as a double symbol of the Holy Trinity and a Fleur-de-lis which symbolizes the Cistercians. It also includes two crusader shields which depict the (left) Lone Star of Texas and (right) the torch of liberty and learning. The wavy lines near the bottom represent the Trinity River (Texas)

=== The Role of the Cistercians ===

Bishop Thomas Gorman wrote as early as 1954 to Abbot Anselm Nagy to ask the displaced Hungarian Cistercian fathers from the Monastery of Zirc to assist in founding the university. On the first day of classes in September 1956, nine Cistercian fathers, at that point half of the entire faculty, were employed at the new university. The history of UD is connected to both those founding Cistercian priests and many more Hungarians who taught there in the first decades.

=== Guadalupe art print scandal ===
On February 14, 2008, an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was removed without permission from the Upper Gallery of the Haggerty Art Village. The image, &quot;Saint or Sinner,&quot; was on loan from Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky as part of a larger exhibit of works by Murray State students. The piece reportedly portrayed the Virgin Mary as a stripper. 

After students voiced criticism, signs were put up to warn visitors that &quot;some items [on display] might be considered offensive.&quot; The university&#x27;s president, Frank Lazarus, publicly criticized the theft. Reaction to Lazarus&#x27; statement prompted heated campus discussion, was discussed online on Catholic blogs and in conservative tabloids.

=== Establishment of the &#x27;Student Leaders for Racial Solidarity&#x27; ===
In 2020, an undergraduate submitted a proposal to establish a club called Student Leaders for Racial Justice. After heated debate on campus, the University administration eventually approved a revised version of the submission, leading to the establishment of the Student Leaders for Racial Solidarity Club.

==Governance and leadership==
As of 2022, the president is Jonathan J. Sanford, an American philosopher who previously served as the school&#x27;s provost.

The University of Dallas is governed by a board of trustees. According to the university&#x27;s by-laws, the Bishop of Dallas is an ex-officio voting member.

Edward Burns, Bishop of the Diocese of Dallas, currently serves as the chancellor. The office, held by a Catholic bishop as stipulated by the constitution of the university, is an unpaid, honorary position.

Previous chancellors include:
*Thomas Kiely Gorman (1954–1969)
*Thomas Ambrose Tschoepe (1969–1990)
*Charles Victor Grahmann (1990–2007)
*Kevin J. Farrell (2008–2016)

Previous presidents include:
*F. Kenneth Brasted (1956–1959)
*Robert J. Morris (1960–1962)
*Donald A. Cowan (1962–1977)
*John R. Sommerfeldt (1978–1980)
*Robert F. Sasseen (1981–1995)
*Milam J. Joseph (1996–2003)
*Frank Lazarus (2004–2010)
*Thomas Keefe (2010–2018)
*Thomas S. Hibbs (2019–2021)

==Campus==
The university is located in Irving, Texas, on a 744-acre (301 hectare) campus in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The Las Colinas development is nearby. It is 10 miles (16 km) from downtown Dallas. The campus consists mostly of mid-twentieth-century modernist, earth-toned brick buildings set amidst the native Texas landscape. Several of these buildings were designed by the well-known Texas architect O&#x27;Neil Ford, dubbed the Godfather of Texas modernism. The mall is the center of campus, with the 187.5 feet tall (57.15 meters) Braniff Memorial Tower as its focal point.


&quot;The Princeton Review&quot; claimed the University of Dallas had the fourth-least beautiful campus among the America&#x27;s top colleges and universities. &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;″s October 2013 issue lists it as one of America&#x27;s ugliest college campuses, citing its &quot;low-profile, boxy architecture that bears uncanny resemblance to a public car park,&quot; but noting that a recent $12 million donation from alumni Satish and Yasmin Gupta would bring new campus construction.

A Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Orange Line light-rail station opened near campus on July 30, 2012.

The campus is home to the Orpheion Theatre, a small Greek-style performance space built into a hillside in 2003. Most plays are performed in the Drama Building.

==Academics==
===Core curriculum and traditional liberal education===
The university has resisted a focus on &quot;trades and job training&quot; and pursued the traditional ideas of a liberal arts education according to the model described by John Henry Newman in &quot;The Idea of a University&quot;. Donald and Louise Cowan were instrumental in developing and implementing the university&#x27;s &quot;Core Curriculum,&quot; a collection of approximately twenty courses (two years) of common study covering philosophy, theology, history, literature, politics, economics, mathematics, science, art, and a foreign language. The curriculum includes a slate of required courses which cover specific texts, permitting professors to assume a common body of knowledge and speak across disciplines. Classes in these core subjects typically have an average class size of 16 students to permit frequent discussion. Dallas is one of 25 schools graded &quot;A&quot; by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni for a solid core curriculum.

There is a similar core curriculum for graduate studies in the Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts.

===Undergraduate===
Undergraduate students are enrolled in the Constantin College of Liberal Arts, the Satish &amp; Yasmin Gupta College of Business, or the Ann &amp; Joe O. Neuhoff School of Ministry. The university awards bachelors’ degrees in arts and sciences.

UD offers a five-year dual-degree program in electrical engineering in collaboration with The University of Texas at Arlington.

In 1970, the university started a study-abroad program in which Dallas students, generally sophomores, spend a semester at the university’s campus southeast of Rome in the Alban Hills along the Via Appia Nuova.

===Graduate programs===
The Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts administers master&#x27;s degrees in American Studies, art, English, humanities, philosophy, politics, psychology, and theology, as well as an interdisciplinary doctoral program with concentrations in English, philosophy, and politics.

The Satish and Yasmin Gupta College of Business is an AACSB-accredited business school offering a part-time MBA program for working professionals, a Master of Science program, a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Graduate Certificates, graduate preparatory programs, and professional development courses.

Patrick and Judy Kelly built up the UD drama program beginning in 1972. The first productions were in a former cafeteria, which after adaptations was named the Margaret Jonsson Theater. As part of the opening festivities in November of 1972, actor Charles Siebert held a speech. Patrick Kelly directed sixty productions in over forty years at the university. Students Peter MacNichol and Christopher Evan Welch went on to successful acting careers.

<text>Harlan Carey Brewster (November 10, 1870 – March 1, 1918) was a politician in British Columbia, Canada. Brewster arrived in British Columbia in 1893 and had various careers working on a ship and then in a cannery. He eventually became the owner of his own canning company. He was elected to the provincial legislature in the 1907 election and was one of only two Liberals elected to the legislature in the 1909 election.

Brewster became leader of the opposition, and was elected party leader in March 1912. He lost his seat a few weeks later in the 1912 election, which returned no Liberals at all. In 1916, he won election to the legislature again through a by-election and led his party to victory in a general election later that year by campaigning on a reform platform. Brewster promised to end patronage in the civil service, end political machines, improve workmen&#x27;s compensation and labour laws, bring in votes for women, and other progressive reforms.

In government, Brewster brought in women&#x27;s suffrage, instituted prohibition, and combatted political corruption before his unexpected death in 1918. He is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

He also served as Minister of Finance between February 15, 1917 and June 11, 1917.

<doc id="550355" wikidata="Q1088651" url="?curid=550355" title="Chrysler Cirrus">
<text>The Chrysler Cirrus is a mid-sized 4-door notchback sedan introduced by Chrysler motors for the 1995 model year. Built on the Chrysler JA platform, the 4-door notchback sedan joined Chrysler&#x27;s roster of &quot;Cloud Car&quot; models drawing their names from meteorological terms, including the mid-priced Dodge Stratus it was based on introduced at the same time, and the low-priced Plymouth Breeze variant a year later.

==Design==
Development of the Cirrus started in 1991, with the goal of creating an affordable, expressive-looking, fun-to-drive vehicle that was still safe enough to transport an everyday family.

The concept car designed for the 1992 auto show circuit featured rear suicide doors and a turbocharged 3.0 L two-stroke engine using alcohol fuel. The concept also foreshadowed a hood-line with almost no break with the windshield to improve aerodynamics.

Both the concept and production model used the Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s new cab-forward design, which was launched on the larger LH sedans in 1992. This three-box design was characterized by a large passenger cabin in proportion to a comparatively short hood and trunk, highlighted by a long, dramatically slanted windshield and short overhangs. Pushing the wheels further to the corners of the body created a much larger cabin than most other similarly sized vehicles of that time.

The a four-door notchback sedan was designed with flowing lines with no distinct beginning or end, but almost resembled a two-box fastback. Design work was done during 1991, with the final version moved on for production by 1992.

==Features==
The Cirrus was introduced for 1995 as a replacement for the Chrysler LeBaron sedan. It was often compared to other smaller mid-size cars such as the Chevrolet Malibu, yet judged roomier than the Ford Contour by many magazines such as &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;. The exteriors of the Chrysler Cirrus, Dodge Stratus, and Plymouth Breeze were very similar, with the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels being the main differences. The interiors had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The fascias of each JA car corresponds with each brand&#x27;s minivan offering, sharing headlights, and grille designs.

All three variants of the platform were available with most of the same standard features: four-wheel independent suspension (double wishbone in the front with a multilink rear), air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, and driver and front-passenger air bags and available options, such as the following: an optional four-speed automatic transmission (Autostick was not available on the Breeze), anti-lock brakes, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, sunroof. A five-speed manual was standard with the 2.0 L. The 2.4 L was not offered in a manual because of its high torque and difficult drivability issues, mainly due to excessive wheel spinning at speeds over 100 mph.
The Cirrus was originally available in two trim levels: the well-equipped base &quot;LX&quot; and the luxury &quot;LXi&quot;. Both models featured sporty, black twin-post side mirrors, fog lights, the same body side moldings, chrome bumper accents, an automatic transmission and a low extending waterfall grille that was either chrome or body-colored depending on the color of the vehicle. The Cirrus was one of the first Chrysler vehicles to feature the rose medallion logo, which had not been used in 41 years. From 1995 to 1997, the Cirrus was offered in two trim levels: the entry-level LX and the luxury LXi. The LX model was dropped for the 1998 model year, but returned in 2000 to compensate for the Plymouth Breeze that was discontinued early in the 2000 model year. It was replaced by the 2001 Dodge Stratus sedan.

The Cirrus was used as a patrol cruiser by the Macedonian police from 2000 to the 2010s.

===Trim levels===
The LX (1995–1997; 2000) was the base Chrysler Cirrus trim level. It included the following standard equipment: a 2.4 L I4 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and six speakers, air conditioning, full instrumentation, power windows and door locks, exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles, and premium cloth seats.

The LXi (1995–2000) was the top-of-the-line Chrysler Cirrus trim level. It added the following equipment to the LX trim level: alloy wheels, a premium AM/FM stereo with cassette player and integrated CD changer controls, keyless entry, chrome accents, a premium front grille, and wood grain interior trim.

===Engines===
*2.4 L I4
*2.5 L V6

===Model year changes===
*1995: The all-new Chrysler Cirrus sedan is launched in the United States and Canada in late 1994.
*1996: Rear headrests were added.
*1997: The 4-cylinder engine was made standard in both models, with the V6 as an option. The interior gained a new center console with a storage compartment and integrated armrest.
*1998: The 4-cylinder engine and the LX trim level were eliminated, leaving only V6 LXi models.
*1999: For its fifth model year, the Cirrus received a redesigned open grille with Chrysler&#x27;s new winged grille badge. Chrysler&#x27;s Sentry Key system was a new option. Sentry Key disabled the ignition unless the proper key was inserted. Standard wheel covers could be upgraded to new alloy wheels. Cirrus was the only one of the JA &quot;cloud cars&quot; to receive any form of a facelift over the course of its production.
*2000: For its final model year, the 4-cylinder LX model returned to join the V6-powered LXi sedan. Previously optional rear child seat anchorages, aluminum wheels, and an 8-speaker AM/FM radio stereo were now listed as standard features.

==Plymouth Breeze==


The Plymouth Breeze was released in 1995 as a 1996 model. Although it did not match the sales of its predecessor, the Acclaim, the Breeze did manage to sell over 230,000 units and total production was greater than that of its Chrysler Cirrus sibling, which was produced for nearly two additional years.

As part of Chrysler&#x27;s new marketing strategy which addressed concerns that its brands were treading into each other&#x27;s marketing territory, Plymouth, as Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s low-price brand for essentially its entire existence, was to focus exclusively on value. As a result, the Breeze (as well as the base model Stratus) filled the position as the entry-level JA car. Due to this, the Breeze lacked certain features including an available V6 engine, alloy wheels, leather interior, body-colored door handles, fog lights, and Chrysler&#x27;s Autostick transmission, all of which were offered on the Stratus and Cirrus.

The Plymouth Breeze came only as one basic model. Equipped similarly to a base model Dodge Stratus, the Breeze came standard with the 2.0 L I4 engine, five-speed manual transmission, 14-inch wheel covers, air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, AM/FM stereo, and driver and front-passenger airbags. The Breeze was also available with many options including a four-speed automatic transmission, 2.4 L I4 engine (available with automatic transmission only), anti-lock brakes, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, cassette or CD player, and a power sunroof. Additionally, 1998 and 1999 Breezes offered an &quot;Expresso Package&quot; similar to the one available on the Voyager and Neon. &quot;Expresso&quot; content included special badging, unique wheel covers, upgraded audio system, and premium interior cloth in unique &quot;Rhythm&quot; pattern. The Breeze was discontinued early in the 2000 model year, as part of Chrysler&#x27;s phaseout of the Plymouth brand; the last Breeze rolled off the Sterling Heights Assembly line on January 7, 2000.

===Trim levels===
The Base (1996–2000) was the least-expensive trim level of the Plymouth Breeze from 1996 to 1999, and the only available trim level for the Breeze&#x27;s final year of production in 2000. The Base included the following standard equipment: a 2.0 L I4 engine, a five-speed manual transmission, fifteen-inch black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an A/M-F/M stereo with four speakers, full instrumentation, air conditioning, cloth seats, and manual windows and door locks.

The Expresso (1998–1999) was the top-of-the-line trim level of the Plymouth Breeze, but was discontinued after 1999. The Expresso added the following equipment to the Base trim level: power windows and door locks, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and six speakers, premium cloth seats, exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles, and a 2.4 L I4 engine with a four-speed automatic transmission. An &quot;Expresso&quot; decal adorned both front doors, as well as the rear trunk lid.

===Engines===
*2.0 L I4
*2.4 L I4

===Year-to-year changes===
===1996=== 
* Plymouth Breeze sedan is released to replace the Plymouth Acclaim.
* The V6 is now quicker.
* New window tints.
* During mid-96 a sunroof is added as an option.
===1997=== 
* A new center console which included storage space, an integrated armrest, and rear-seat cupholders.
===1998=== 
* The 2.4 L I4 is added as an option, and the &quot;Expresso&quot; trim level.
===1999=== 
* Revised suspension tuning for a smoother ride.
===2000=== 
* Breeze production was halted early in 2000, due to the phaseout of the Plymouth brand name. 
* Only the base model Breeze was available.

==Dodge Stratus==


The Dodge Stratus was introduced in February 1995, with two trims: base (later renamed &quot;SE&quot; for 2000), which came standard with the 2.0 L I4 or optional 2.4 L; and the ES, which came standard with the a 2.0 L from 1994 to 1997, and had a DOHC 2.4 L and a 2.5 L V6 as optional. In 1998 the 2.4 L was standard and the 2.5 L V6 was optional on the ES, and from 1999 to 2000, the 2.5 L V6 was the only engine on the ES model.

The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume Spirit and Dynasty (United States only) to favorable reviews, but lower sales.

Mexico:
A turbocharged version of the Stratus was sold in Mexico, with the 2.4 L DOHC 4-cylinder engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission with AutoStick. This engine produced at 5200 rpm and of torque at 2200 rpm.

In 2000, the Stratus was available for its last year of sales in Canada, with the Chrysler Sebring taking over as the company&#x27;s only lower mid-size sedan - Dodge did not sell the equivalent version in Canada.

===Chrysler Stratus===
The Stratus was marketed as the Chrysler Stratus in markets that the Dodge name was not used; such as Europe, Argentina, and Brazil. In Brazil, the Stratus had the same engines as the North American version but a higher ground clearance for the road conditions there. In Europe, only the 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine or the 2.5 L V6 engine were available. The European version also had chrome accent moldings along the doors and bumpers.

===Year-to-year changes===
===1995=== 
* Stratus sedan is released.
===1996=== 
* The headrest is now &quot;pillow&quot; like on all seats.
===1997=== 
* A new center console which included storage space, an integrated armrest, and rear-seat cupholders.
===1998=== 
* 2.4 L becomes standard on &quot;ES&quot;
===1999=== 
* V6 engine becomes standard on &quot;ES&quot;
===2000=== 
* &quot;Base&quot; trim renamed &quot;SE&quot;

===Trim levels===
The Base (1995–1999) was the least expensive trim level of Stratus from 1995 to 1999. The Base was equipped with a 2.0 L I4 engine, a five-speed manual transmission, fifteen-inch black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an A/M-F/M stereo with four speakers, air conditioning, manual windows and door locks, cloth seats, and a full instrument cluster.

The SE (1999–2000) was the least expensive trim level of Stratus in 2000. The SE included the same standard equipment as the previously-base Base trim level of Stratus.

The ES (1995–2000) was the top-of-the-line trim level of Stratus from 1995 to 2000. The ES added the following equipment to the Base or SE trim levels: a 2.4 L I4 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, alloy wheels, a premium A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and integrated CD changer controls with six speakers, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, a power-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, premium cloth seats, and exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles.

<doc id="550369" wikidata="Q97339311" url="?curid=550369" title="Mighty Orbots">
<text>is a 1984 American-Japanese super robot animated series created in a joint collaboration of TMS Entertainment, Inc. and Intermedia Entertainment in association with MGM/UA Television. It was directed by veteran anime director Osamu Dezaki and features character designs by Akio Sugino. The series aired from September 8, 1984, to December 15, 1984, on Saturday mornings in the United States on ABC.

== Series history ==
&quot;Mighty Orbots&quot; was developed from an idea pitched by Fred Silverman, possibly in response to the popularity of other robot-related properties. The original six-minute &quot;pilot&quot; featured a slightly different version of Mighty Orbots called &quot;Broots&quot; (pronounced &quot;Brutes&quot;). Rob and Ohno looked similar to their &#x27;finished&#x27; selves, though definitively more late 70s-like. The Orbots, while having the same names as in the finished product, are subtly different, and obviously unfinished. Even their combined form aka &quot;Super-Broots&quot; would go through some more developmental evolution before becoming Mighty Orbots. It was produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha and Intermedia Entertainment in association with MGM/UA Television for both the United States for the television broadcast and Japan via home video. Unlike many other shows of its kind, &quot;Mighty Orbots&quot; was not simply a translated Japanese import. The series was directed by anime industry veteran Osamu Dezaki with storyboard work by Dezaki&#x27;s brother Satoshi Dezaki, character designs by Akio Sugino, and animation by Shingo Araki.

The main theme song used in the show introduction and throughout the series was created by Steve Rucker and Thomas Chase, with lead vocals provided by Warren Stanyer. The music was composed by Yuji Ohno.

The series lasted only a single season of thirteen episodes, mostly due to a lawsuit between the show&#x27;s creators and toymaker Tonka, who accused them of causing brand confusion with their GoBots franchise&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Robots, Mighty Vehicles&quot; advertising campaign. The episodes aired on ABC and some episodes were later released on VHS by MGM/UA Home Video. Despite its short run, the series has a dedicated fan base today. The series&#x27; narration was done by voice-actor Gary Owens, who was the voice of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Space Ghost&quot; in the 1960s and &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot;&#x27;s human straight man Blue Falcon in the late 1970s.

&quot;Mighty Orbots&quot; is one of only a small number of Saturday morning cartoons to have a definite series finale: the final episode, &quot;Invasion of the Shadow Star,&quot; ends with a sequence in which the SHADOW homeworld is destroyed and the arch-villain Umbra defeated &quot;once and for all.&quot; This differs from most other animated series, where the villain always escaped to fight another day.

== Series plot ==
The 23rd Century, the future is a time of robots and aliens. The people of Earth have banded together along with several other peaceful alien races to promote peace throughout the galaxy, forming the United Planets. As part of the United Planets, the Galactic Patrol — a body of law-enforcers — works to maintain order, under the leadership of Commander Rondu.
However, a powerful criminal organization called SHADOW is out to destroy both the Galactic Patrol and the U.P. Led by Lord Umbra, a massive cyborg-computer, SHADOW employs sinister agents and incredible schemes to attack and someday rule over all corners of the known-galaxy.

There is one thing that helps to fight against SHADOW: ingenious inventor Rob Simmons — secretly a member of the Galactic Patrol — creates six special robots who can use their unique powers to battle against the forces of Umbra. Together, these robots can unite to form a giant robot called Mighty Orbots, to fight for truth, justice and peace for all.

== Characters ==
=== Hero characters ===
* Rob Simmons – A brilliant inventor and scientist, he is the creator of Mighty Orbots and, as such, is also a secret member of the Galactic Patrol. In general, he poses as a mild-mannered robotics engineer and tinkers in his own laboratory complex (in some unnamed location) on Earth, but when needed, he uses a transformation matrix to change his regular lab clothes – called an Omni-Suit – into the uniform and helmet of his alter-ego, the Orbots Commander. It is by this alternate persona that the rest of the Galactic Patrol knows of him publicly, including Dia. Only Commander Rondu knows that the bespectacled Rob and the heroic Orbots Commander are the same.

: Rob has curly blond hair and blue eyes. He can summon the Orbots from their recharge chambers with a remote signal from a device he wears on his wrist. He pilots the Beam Car; a special vehicle that acts as a &quot;command center&quot; when linked up within Mighty Orbots&#x27; core body. From there, he and Ohno can operate Mighty Orbots with maximum effectiveness in battle.

: Voiced by Barry Gordon (English) and Yū Mizushima (Japanese)

* Commander Rondu – The primary leader of the Galactic Patrol, Rondu is of a race of alien humanoids who somewhat resemble Earth humans (save he has slanted eyes and pointed ears, similar to archetypal fantasy elves; It could also be a reference to the Vulcan species from &quot;Star Trek&quot;). Rondu is a calm, wise leader and – as it appears throughout the series – has been in charge of the Galactic Patrol for many years. He serves along with his daughter, Dia, who serves as a senior officer. Only Rondu knows about the Orbots Commander&#x27;s secret identity, as well as the six robots (who apparently also have dual identities as well).

: Rondu has long silver-white hair and facial hair, and grey-white eyes. He exhibits formidable psionic powers; something that must be key to his race (since a space pirate named Shrike wanted to use his &quot;unique life-force&quot; to power a super-weapon in the episode &quot;Raid on the Stellar Queen&quot;).

: Voiced by Don Messick (English) and Shozo Hirabayashi (Japanese)

* Dia Rondu – A senior officer and agent of the Galactic Patrol, Dia serves under her father&#x27;s command, and is considered one of the &quot;top&quot; agents on the force. She is a good starship pilot and warrior, but occasionally finds herself in jeopardy, needing to be rescued by Mighty Orbots. She has a fascination and apparent love-interest in the Orbots Commander, but doesn&#x27;t see his alter ego, Rob, as anything more than a good friend and fellow supporter for peace (she is unaware of the fact Rob and the Orbots Commander are the same).

: Dia has long, silver-white hair and dark eyes. Aside from being highly skilled in fighting, acrobatics and flying ships, Dia often captures agents of SHADOW in a force-field projector stored in a wrist band on her left arm. It is never said if she possesses the same psionic powers her father does. It is hinted at in &quot;Operation: Eclipse&quot;, however, when she volunteers to aid her father in mental battle with Dreneon, who is a member of the same race working for Shadow.

: Voiced by Jennifer Darling (English) and Atsuko Koganezawa (Japanese)

=== The Orbots ===
* Ohno Robotti – The first robot of the Orbots so named for her propensity to exclaim &quot;Oh, no!&quot; and quite possibly the leader of the team, Ohno resembles a small, female child in size and demeanor with the &quot;mother hen&quot; personality of a bossy little sister that can often get on the nerves of Rob and the others. Feisty, yet supportive in her role as Rob&#x27;s assistant, Ohno helps keep the lab running and the rest of the team in line. At times, she feels neglected and unappreciated, but through thick and thin she&#x27;s always there to lend the team a hand (and a nag when needed).

: Ohno&#x27;s primary colors are pink, red and white. When Mighty Orbots forms its &quot;gestalt&quot; form, it is Ohno that completes the final circuit &quot;link&quot; that allows the full power of the giant robot form to come online. Without this vital piece, Mighty Orbots cannot become fully functional (a flaw that was exploited once by Umbra under the machinations of the Shadow Agent called Plasmus, in the episode &quot;The Wish World&quot;). If necessary, Ohno can operate the controls alone for basic functions, but combat is simply too demanding without the Commander on board. Ohno also carries the repair tools and recharge kit needed should the Orbots be caught off-world away from their base recharge chambers.

: Voiced by Noelle North (English) and Miki Ito (Japanese)

* Tor Robotti – A boastful, burly brute-sized male robot with a voice like Link Hogthrob, he is the strongest of the six team members. Although quite often portrayed as being a bit slow and with a very high opinion of himself, Tor had the ability to think on his feet during battles with SHADOW monsters and henchmen. Kind and supportive towards his friends, although often with a good-naturedly egotistical macho attitude that annoys his female teammates, Tor is the &quot;de facto&quot; vice leader of the Orbots, especially when Ohno is not leading them directly at the time, but he will take cues from the others when the situation merits it.

: Tor&#x27;s primary colors are silver, red and blue. When forming the &quot;&quot; form of Mighty Orbots, Tor retracts his arms and legs into himself to form the central body and head.

: Voiced by Bill Martin (English) and Tessho Genda (Japanese)

* Bort Robotti – A gaunt-thin male robot with a nervous personality and a voice like Lou Costello, he is the one member of the team that is the most handy due to having been built with quick-change circuits and other abilities that allow Bort to reconfigure himself into literally any machine or device he can think of. Often showing a lack of confidence in himself, Bort is portrayed as being clumsy, indecisive and depressive. Yet, when the chips are down, Bort always comes through in the clutch for his team.

: Bort&#x27;s primary colors are silver and blue. When forming the &quot;gestalt&quot; form of Mighty Orbots, he retracts into a boxy unit that forms the lower right leg. While connected, he can use his quick-change circuits to modify the hands of Mighty Orbots into a variety of offensive and defensive weapons.

: Voiced by Jim MacGeorge (English) and Ken Yamaguchi (Japanese)

* Bo Robotti – One of the three female robot team members, she is the most outgoing, assertive and confident female on the team. Sometimes she likes to play practical jokes, but at times they can backfire (like when she removed Crunch&#x27;s appetite chip, only to have it broken when they needed it in the episode &quot;Trapped on The Prehistoric Planet&quot;). She is a caring soul and will do what she can to support her teammates. She has the ability to manipulate the elements—fire, water, wind, etc.—to use in a myriad of offensive and defensive effects (whirlwinds, water geysers, etc.).

: Bo&#x27;s primary colors are pale yellow and orange. When forming the &quot;gestalt&quot; form of Mighty Orbots, she transforms to become the left arm, which forms a hand after it is connected to the main body. Through her connection, she can channel her elemental powers throughout the body of Mighty Orbots.

: Voiced by Sherry Alberoni (English) and Akari Hibino (Japanese)

* Boo Robotti – The third female team member and twin sister to Bo, she is the shyest member of the team and soft spoken, yet she can prove to be as brave as her twin in combat, even standing up for herself and others (especially when Bo&#x27;s pranks go too far). Boo has the ability to manipulate light and energy in ways that would appear to be &quot;magic&quot;; she can turn herself and others invisible, create force fields, levitate objects and even teleport. She can also channel energy to form optical illusions and holograms.

: Boo&#x27;s primary colors are white and yellow. When forming the &quot;gestalt&quot; form of Mighty Orbots, she transforms to become the right arm of the giant robot. Like Bo, she can channel her defensive abilities throughout the larger body, allowing it to benefit from all of her &quot;magic&quot; effects.

: Voiced by Julie Bennett (English) and Hitomi Oikawa (Japanese)

* Crunch Robotti – A stoutly robust (sic &quot;chubby&quot;) male robot whose personality seems to be focused on one thing; simply put, Crunch loves to eat. His prime ability —coupled with his steel trap-like jaws and teeth —allows him to consume any materials available (metal, stone, glass, circuits, garbage, etc.) and digest it so it can be converted into energy. Often, he&#x27;s a subject of comic-relief due to his eating habits. Crunch seems simple-minded, but he does prove to have some brains and is a good friend and a steadfast, supportive personality.

: Crunch&#x27;s primary colors are purple and black. When forming the &quot;gestalt&quot; form of Mighty Orbots, Crunch forms a boxy unit that forms the lower left leg. While connected, Crunch also serves as the back-up power source for the giant robot and, at times, will detach so he can consume any available items to give his team mates a much-needed power boost.

=== Villain characters ===
* Lord Umbra – The leader of SHADOW, Umbra is an artificial intelligence that is the size of a planet&#x27;s core; often depicted as a large head with a mouth, a vestigial nose and five eyes. It is through his efforts, organizing through his minions and agents, that Umbra strives to conquer the galaxy. Operating from inside a massive base supercomputer of a sun called the Shadow Star, which essentially has a Dyson sphere, his network of informants and spies keep him abreast of any developments within the United Planets. The weaponry and defensive systems of the Shadow Star are so ominous that a direct assault by Galactic Patrol forces is considered to be out of the question. The Shadow Star can generate so much power that it is able to move under Umbra&#x27;s direction, and any sector of space it occupies will be totally under Shadow control.

: Umbra himself has no real means of directly fighting his enemies, so he employs massive monsters, sinister aliens and elaborate plans to combat the threat of the Galactic Patrol and Mighty Orbots.

* Draconis the Tobor Commander – An agent of SHADOW, who works with Umbra in a diabolical plan to discredit and defeat the Orbots. He works with a duplicate, giant robot impostor, named Mighty Tobor, who resembles the assembled &quot;gestalt&quot; form of Mighty Orbots. Together, they first attack the peaceful peoples of the galaxy to make the Galactic Patrol believe that the Orbots have turned evil. Then, after the Orbots are put on trial and sentenced to &#x27;life&#x27; on the Great Prison Planet, Draconis – who had managed to infiltrate the prison and put himself as the chief warden – would put the Orbots through grueling, demeaning and deadly tasks that would have destroyed them. However, Draconis and Tobor were exposed, and eventually defeated by Dia and the Orbots.
* Captain Shrike – The leader of a gang of space pirates, Captain Shrike lashes out against unsuspecting ships and travelers from within the Sargasso Star Cluster; wherein lies his secret base. He battled Mighty Orbots after he hijacked a starliner, the Stellar-Queen, to use her hyperdrive engine along with the life-force of Commander Rondu to create a super weapon.

: Shrike uses a cybernetic eye to control his Master Computer, as well as stun his foes with a stasis-ray. Using his Master Computer, Shrike used Rondu&#x27;s life-force to create a creature called a Titan (which looked like a Japanese Oni), to battle Mighty Orbots.

: Shrike was the only villain who was &quot;not&quot; a member of SHADOW.

* Plasmus – An alien shape-shifter, Plasmus was ordered by Umbra to find a weakness in Mighty Orbots so SHADOW could destroy them. Plasmus discovered that Ohno was a key to Mighty Orbots power, after he tricked her into traveling to the Wish World, where she was turned into a human girl. Plasmus later battled Mighty Orbots in the Emerald Nebula, in an attempt to defeat them, but was shoved into a hyper-warp and was never seen again.

: Plasmus could change his shape to resemble any type of non-robotic life form. He mostly traveled as a mass of gaseous, green/white vapor, which is what appeared as he transformed. As well, he could draw upon energy and matter to enlarge his strength and mass exponentially.

<text>Antony David John Penikett (born November 14, 1945) is a mediator and negotiator and former politician in Yukon, Canada, who served as the third premier of Yukon from 1985 to 1992.

==Early life and political activity==
Born in Sussex, England, on November 14, 1945, and educated at St Albans School in Hertfordshire, England, and in Alberta and Ontario, Penikett began his Yukon working life as an asbestos mine labourer at Clinton Creek, Yukon, where he became active in his union as a shop steward and chair of the grievance committee.

An activist with the New Democratic Party (NDP), Penikett was campaign manager in the 1972 election for Wally Firth, the first Indigenous northern MP ever elected to the House of Commons. He was the party&#x27;s candidate in Yukon in the 1974 federal election, but was not elected.

Penikett became a member of the New Democratic Party&#x27;s federal council in 1973 and served as executive assistant to Ed Broadbent from 1975 to 1977. He then returned to Yukon, where he was elected to Whitehorse City Council in 1977.

He was president of the federal NDP from 1981 to 1985.

==Premier of Yukon==
He was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in 1978, representing the constituency of Whitehorse West as a member of the Yukon New Democratic Party. He was the party&#x27;s only MLA elected that year.

In 1981, Penikett succeeded Fred Berger as leader of the party. Under his leadership, independent MLA Maurice Byblow crossed the floor to join the party, and Roger Kimmerly won a by-election for the party in October. With the party having surpassed the Yukon Liberal Party in seats, Penikett became Leader of the Opposition.

The party won six seats in the 1982 election, retaining Official Opposition status.

In the 1985 territorial election, the party won eight seats, forming a minority government with Penikett serving as government leader. Four of the party&#x27;s eight MLAs were of First Nations descent, with a by-election win by Danny Joe in 1987 bringing First Nations representation in the government to five out of nine; this remains the all-time historical record for First Nations representation in a Canadian legislature. Joe&#x27;s by-election win also lifted the party to majority government status.

Penikett fought the federal government for a better deal for the territory in Canadian confederation and for control over its natural resources. He and Dennis Patterson, premier of the Northwest Territories, also fought for a greater role at First Minister&#x27;s conferences. Penikett&#x27;s government negotiated and signed an umbrella agreement for First Nations land claims, negotiated the first four agreements with individual First Nations, and developed an economic development strategy for the Yukon in consultation with citizens.

Penikett also brought forward the Yukon Human Rights Act, which banned discrimination on the basis of age, race, gender or sexual orientation. It was only the second such act passed anywhere in Canada.

The NDP formed a majority government after the 1989 election, winning nine seats. Later that year, Penikett took on the title of Premier, the first government leader in the territory to be given that title, in a bid to increase the territory&#x27;s clout in relations with the federal and provincial governments.

Penikett&#x27;s government opposed the Meech Lake Accord, believing it would make it impossible for the Yukon to ever become a province. According to Penikett, the accord violated the rights of Yukon residents by granting to each existing province an absolute veto over the creation of a new province, as well as by giving provinces, but not territories, consultation rights on the appointment of new Senators and new Supreme Court justices, and would condemn northerners to &quot;forever be second-class citizens&quot;. Penikett&#x27;s government fought the accord in court, although its case was dismissed by the Yukon Court of Appeal. During the subsequent Charlottetown Accord negotiations, Penikett raised many of the same concerns that he had during Meech, although he ultimately supported the final deal.

After seven years in power, the NDP was defeated in the 1992 election by the conservative Yukon Party. Penikett&#x27;s successor, John Ostashek, dropped Penikett&#x27;s use of the title &quot;Premier&quot;, reverting to the older form &quot;Government Leader&quot;, although the &quot;Premier&quot; title was reinstituted in 1996 by Piers McDonald and has remained in use ever since.

On April 25, 1994 Penikett announced his resignation as leader of the Yukon NDP, and was succeeded by Piers McDonald at a party convention in May 1995. There was an attempt later in 1994 to draft Penikett as a candidate in the federal New Democratic Party&#x27;s 1995 leadership contest, but he declined to run.

He remained in the legislature as the MLA for Whitehorse West until September 27, 1995, when he resigned to accept a position as a policy advisor in the office of Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow.

==Later career==
After two years as an advisor in the cabinet planning unit with the Government of Saskatchewan, in 1998 he was appointed by the government of British Columbia to lead contract negotiations with the province&#x27;s public sector unions.

Between 1998 and 2000, Penikett and his colleague John Calvert negotiated 32 public sector accords (on early retirement, pay equity and joint trusteeship of pension plans) with public sector employer organizations and unions representing 250,000 provincial public employers. This is to date the largest number of social contracts ever negotiated in Canada.

From 2001 to 2005, Penikett was a senior fellow on native treaty issues and a visiting professor for the Undergraduate Semester in Dialogue at Simon Fraser University. He has also worked at the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation, and for West Coast Environmental Law.

Penikett was appointed as the University of Washington&#x27;s Canada Fulbright Chair in Arctic Studies for 2013-14. For the duration of this award, he will be located at the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, and conducting a “Comparative Study of Canadian and U.S. Approaches to Issues of Arctic Governance in the 21st Century.”

Since 2001, he is the president of Tony Penikett Negotiations.

In 2020 he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, in recognition of his contributions as a teacher, negotiator and public servant.

==Personal life==
Penikett is the father of actor Tahmoh Penikett, best known for his work as Karl Agathon in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and Paul Ballard in &quot;Dollhouse&quot;. His twin daughters Sarah and Stephanie Penikett have also appeared on television, in &quot;Psych&quot; and &quot;The L-Word&quot;. Their mother, Lulla Sierra Johns, is a member of the White River First Nation.

Penikett is the author of &quot;Reconciliation: First Nations Treaty Making in British Columbia&quot; (Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2006); two television films, &quot;The Mad Trapper&quot; (BBC TV, London, 1972) and &quot;La Patrouille Perdu&quot; (ORTF, Paris, 1974); and several plays.

<text>The horseshoe is an open-faced sandwich originating in Springfield, Illinois, United States. It consists of thick-sliced toasted bread (often Texas toast), a hamburger patty or other choice of meat, French fries, and cheese sauce. 

While hamburger has become the most common meat on a horseshoe, the original meat was ham. The &quot;horseshoe&quot; name has been variously attributed to the horseshoe-like shape of a slice of bone-in ham, or to the horseshoe-like arrangement of potato wedges around the ham.

It is not uncommon to substitute other meat for the hamburger, such as chicken or ham, or use more than one type of meat. For fries, the preparer may substitute tater tots, waffle fries, or other forms of fried potatoes. 

Although cheese sauces vary by chef, it is generally derived from Welsh rarebit. Common ingredients include eggs, stale beer, butter, sharp cheddar cheese, Worcestershire sauce, flour, dry mustard, paprika, salt and pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

A smaller portion, with one slice of bread and one serving of meat, is called a pony shoe.

A breakfast horseshoe is also available. The hamburger and french fries are replaced with sausage or bacon, eggs, and hash browns. The cheese sauce can also be substituted with milk gravy.

Ross&#x27; Restaurant in Bettendorf, Iowa, was known for a similar dish called the Magic Mountain before closing permanently in February 2023. Instead of a hamburger patty, the sandwich contains steamed loose meat. It has been enjoyed by politicians and celebrities including Barack Obama and Bette Midler.

<doc id="550377" wikidata="Q345385" url="?curid=550377" title="Moktar Ould Daddah">
<text>Moktar Ould Daddah (; December 25, 1924 – October 14, 2003) was a Mauritanian politician who served as the country&#x27;s first President after it gained its independence from France. Moktar served as the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister from 1957 to 1961 and as its first President of Mauritania, a position he held for 18 years until he was deposed in a military coup d&#x27;etat in 1978. 

He established an authoritarian one-party state, with his Mauritanian People&#x27;s Party being the sole legal political entity in the country, and followed a policy of &quot;Islamic socialism&quot; with many nationalizations of private businesses. In his memoirs, Moktar expressed concern that the issue of slavery in Mauritania could lead to armed conflict that would ultimately destroy the country. 

In foreign affairs, he joined the Non-Aligned Movement and maintained strong links with Mao Zedong and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but he also accepted Western (especially French) foreign aid. During his presidency, Mauritania saw conflict with the Polisario Front in Western Sahara after working to broker a deal to divide the territory with Morocco.

==Background==
Moktar was born to an important marabout family of the Ouled Birri tribe in Boutilimit, Mauritania, French West Africa. After attending elite Islamic academies, he worked for the French colonial administrators as a translator. 

As a law student in Paris, he graduated as the first Mauritanian to hold a University Degree. He was later admitted to the bar at Dakar, Senegal in 1955. Upon his return to Mauritania in the late 1950s, Moktar joined the centre-left Mauritanian Progressive Union, and was elected President of its Executive Council. In 1959, however, he established a new political party, the Mauritanian Regroupment Party. In the last pre-independence legislative elections held later that year, his party won every seat in the National Assembly, and he was appointed Prime Minister. 

He was known for his ability to establish a consensus among different political parties, as well as between the White Moors, Black Moors and Black Africans, Mauritania&#x27;s three main ethnic groups. The balanced representation of different ethnic and political groups in his government won the confidence of the French authorities, who granted independence to Mauritania under his leadership in 1960. Moktar was named Acting President of the new Islamic Republic, and was confirmed in office in the first post-independence election in August 1961. 

== President of Mauritania (1960–1978) ==
As President, Moktar pursued policies that differed markedly from those he had professed prior to independence. In September 1961, he formed a &quot;Government of National Unity&quot; with the main opposition party, and in December, he arranged for the four largest parties to merge as the Mauritanian People&#x27;s Party (PPM), which became the sole legal party. He formalized the one-party state in 1964 with a new Constitution, which set up an authoritarian presidential regime. Moktar justified this decision on the grounds that he considered Mauritania unready for western-style multi-party democracy. 

Under this one-party constitution, Moktar was reelected in uncontested elections in 1966, 1971 and 1976. 

In 1971, Moktar served as President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). At home, however, his policies were criticized. The economy remained strongly dependent on Chinese and French foreign aid. Moreover, drought in the Sahel, principally in the period between 1969 and 1974, and a decline in export revenues due to fall in international prices of iron, had lowered living standards considerably. In 1975, he presented a charter which called for Mauritania to become an &quot;Islamic, nationalist, centralist, and socialist democracy.&quot; This charter was initially popular, and the opposition, in general, welcomed it. 
==War in Western Sahara==
What brought an end to Moktar&#x27;s regime was Mauritania&#x27;s war in Western Sahara against the Polisario Front, an indigenous movement fighting against the Moroccan-Mauritanian attempt to jointly annex the territory, starting in 1975. Moktar had claimed the territory as part of Greater Mauritania since 1957, three years before independence, but the idea had only limited support in the general population. The Mauritanian Moors are closely related to the Sahrawis, and virtually all northern tribes had members on both sides of the (former) frontier, many of whom sympathized with the Polisario&#x27;s demands for independence. 

In addition to the government&#x27;s support for guerrillas in northern Mauritania, several thousand Mauritanians left the country to join the Polisario in its Tindouf camps. Further dissatisfaction arose in the South, from where Black troops were sent to fight what they regarded as an essentially inter-Arab conflict, and one which could, if successful, entrench Moktar&#x27;s discriminatory rule even further by the addition of several thousand new Moorish citizens. But Moktar additionally sought the territory in order to prevent it from falling into Moroccan hands, still wary of the officially defunct Moroccan territorial demands on Mauritania. 

Following the Madrid Accords with Spain, Mauritania annexed a southern portion of the territory, renaming it Tiris al-Gharbiya. However, the small and poorly trained Mauritanian Army failed to stop the guerilla incursions, despite backing from the French Air Force. Polisario then turned to attacking the iron mines in Zouerate, at which point the country&#x27;s economy started backsliding, and Moktar&#x27;s public support tumbled. In 1976, the capital Nouakchott was attacked by the Polisario Front, and Moktar was forced to appoint a military officer to head the Ministry of defense. 

==Downfall and later life==
On 10 July 1978, Lt. Col. Mustafa Ould Salek overthrew Moktar in a military coup, and installed a junta to rule the country in his place. His successors would surrender Mauritania&#x27;s claims to Western Sahara and completely withdraw from the war the following year (August 1979). 

After a period of imprisonment, Moktar was allowed to go into exile in France in August 1979, where he organized an opposition group, the &quot;Alliance pour une Mauritanie Democratique&quot; (AMD) in 1980. Attempts to overthrow the regime from abroad were unsuccessful. 

Moktar was allowed to return to Mauritania on 17 July 2001, but died soon after at a military hospital, following a long illness, in Paris, France on 14 October 2003. His body was subsequently flown back to Mauritania, where it is buried.

<doc id="550379" wikidata="Q3517187" url="?curid=550379" title="Teikei">
<text>is a system of community-supported agriculture in Japan, where consumers purchase food directly from farmers. Teikei is closely associated with small-scale, local, organic farming, and volunteer-based, non-profit partnerships between producers and consumers. Millions of Japanese consumers participate in teikei. It is widely cited as the origin of community-supported agriculture around the world.

While there is some disagreement as to the &quot;first&quot; teikei group, the concept can be traced back to the mid-1960s, when a group of Japanese women banded together to purchase fresh milk. A general movement towards consumer-farmer partnerships in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s was driven by environmental issues and distrust of the quality of food in the conventional food system.

One of the founding teikei groups, the Japan Organic Agriculture Association (JOAA), founded in 1971, describes teikei as &quot;an idea to create an alternative distribution system, not depending on the conventional market. Though the forms of teikei vary, it is basically a direct distribution system. To carry it out, the producer(s) and the consumer(s) have talks and contact to deepen their mutual understanding: both of them provide labor and capital to support their own delivery system... Teikei is not only a practical idea but also a dynamic philosophy to make people think of a better way of life either as a producer or as a consumer through their interaction.&quot;

&quot;Teikei&quot; in Japanese means &quot;cooperation&quot;, &quot;joint business&quot;, or &quot;link-up&quot;. In reference to CSA, it is commonly associated with the slogan &quot;food with the farmer&#x27;s face on it&quot;.

==Teikei abroad==
While there is no evidence that teikei was the inspiration for community-supported agriculture (CSA) in the United States, there have been a few examples of CSA programs that have followed the Japanese model closely. The system is valued for its ability to make small-scale agriculture more economically viable and give more control to consumers over the food they consume. Although the CSA movement was born out of anthroposophical and biodynamic farming initiatives, CSA has also enjoyed the benefit of gaining popularity through the booming organic farming movement in the United States that experienced rapid and growth in the late &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s, leading to the establishment of organic produce in mainstream retail sales.

<doc id="550387" wikidata="Q2000312" url="?curid=550387" title="Premier Automotive Group">
<text>The Premier Automotive Group (PAG) was an organizational division within the Ford Motor Company formed in 1999 to oversee the business operations of Ford&#x27;s high-end automotive marques. The PAG was gradually dismantled from 2006 to 2011 with the divestiture of its constituent brands.

==History==
The Premier Automotive Group was formed in 1999 under then-CEO Jacques Nasser and grew to include the Lincoln, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands. Forbes estimated that, by 2004, Ford had spent $17 billion building on acquisitions to form PAG.

In 2002, Lincoln returned to Ford&#x27;s direct control. Lincoln&#x27;s headquarters had been merged into PAG&#x27;s North American office, where it was run by a German executive based in London, England.

The four other marques in the PAG, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo, were essentially completely different car companies with their own unique markets and dealer networks, so there were few synergies that could be achieved by combining them under one division. Ford attempted to push these brands to share parts and engineering in order to cut costs. This made some vehicles too similar to mass-market Fords, notably the Jaguar X-Type which was a capable compact executive car, yet was perceived as too similar to the Ford Mondeo with it shared its platform. While Volvo had been one of the more successful entry-level luxury brands in the United States when it was independent, as part of PAG, it lost market share to the German luxury marques like BMW and Mercedes-Benz who had expanded their entry-level offerings extensively. 

When Alan Mulally became president and CEO in September 2006, he oversaw Ford&#x27;s dismantling of the Premier Automotive Group. In 2007, Ford sold 92% of Aston Martin to a consortium of investors headed by David Richards. In September 2006, the rights to use the defunct &quot;Rover&quot; brand name had been secured from BMW by Ford to protect the Land Rover brand. In March 2008, Ford sold Jaguar and Land Rover to Indian carmaker Tata Motors. In 2010, Ford sold the Swedish brand Volvo Cars, the last of the PAG brands, to the parent of Chinese carmaker Geely for $1.8 billion.

==Management==
* 1999–2002: Wolfgang Reitzle
* 2002–2005: Mark Fields
* 2005–2008: Lewis Booth

==Headquarters==
The Premier Automotive Group headquarters were located at 1 Premier Place in Irvine, California. It is next door to the Mazda North American Operations office, and is now the main office for Taco Bell.

The Premier Automotive Group office in the United States was completed in 2001 at a cost of $68 million. It was the first Ford building and the first building in Orange County to qualify for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design classification from the U.S. Green Building Council. When the headquarters first opened, some of its floors were each specifically dedicated to one of PAG&#x27;s brands. The complex also included a separate product development centre. In late 2008, a deal was announced to lease the former PAG headquarters building in Irvine to the Taco Bell restaurant chain. Although Ford planned to leave a small product development staff on the property, this was widely seen as the end of the PAG story and an ironic comment on the expensive failure of Ford&#x27;s luxury-car strategy. The &quot;New York Times&quot; asked dryly, &quot;Will they install a drive-up window?&quot;

==Members==
===Aston Martin===
Aston Martin was a member of PAG. Ford acquired an interest in Aston Martin in 1987 and had full control from 1991. It was sold on 12 March 2007 for £479 million. However, Ford retained a £40 million (8%) stake in Aston Martin.

===Lincoln===
Ford&#x27;s luxury car division, Lincoln, was part of the Premier Auto Group in the late 1990s, but was pulled out in 2002 as part of Ford&#x27;s marketing strategy to separate its &quot;import&quot; marques from its domestic ones. During the creation of PAG, Lincoln&#x27;s line-up received a complete overhaul, beginning with the 1998 redesign of the Lincoln Town Car. The same year also saw the introduction of the Lincoln Navigator SUV and in 2000 the Lincoln LS, which shared its engines and platform with the Jaguar S-Type, was introduced. All three cars were designed in Irvine, California and were, according to many critics, heavily influenced by Jaguar design themes. In both years 1998 and 2000 Lincoln was the best-selling luxury car brand in the US. After Cadillac surged in the market in 2002, however, Ford pulled Lincoln out of the PAG in what is according to Jerry Flint of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine a strategy beyond comprehension.

===Jaguar===

Ford made an offer for Jaguar stock in 1989. It was placed in Premier Automotive Group when it was formed. After acquiring Land Rover, Ford market Jaguar and Land Rover together and sold them off together in 2008.

===Land Rover===
Ford acquired Land Rover from BMW in 2000 after the break-up of the former Rover Group. On 18 September 2006, Ford announced the purchase of the rights to use the Rover name. BMW had licensed the Rover name to MG Rover Group from 2000 until 2005, when MG Rover collapsed after a failed merger with SAIC. As part of Ford&#x27;s initial purchase of Land Rover, Ford had the first option to purchase the Rover name if MG Rover Group ceased trading. Ford did not plan to use the name in production, instead buying it merely to protect their use of the name Land Rover.

Ford sold Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in March 2008 for £1.15 billion. As part of Ford&#x27;s sale of Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors, the defunct Rover brand name was included, as well as the Daimler and Lanchester marques.

===Volvo Cars===
Ford acquired Volvo&#x27;s automotive division in 1999, and Volvo&#x27;s commercial vehicles division became a separate company — the two sharing symbols and trademarks. 

With Volvo engineers, Ford was able to adapt Volvo&#x27;s Haldex AWD to Ford models as well as adapt the Volvo P2 Platform to its D3 and D4 Platforms — used for the Ford Five Hundred, Taurus X, Flex and Explorer as well as the Lincoln MKS, MKT. 

Volvo engineers incorporated numerous Volvo safety innovations in to these vehicles including a bolt-in hydroformed cross-car steel beam between the B-pillars directly below an identical reinforced roof crossbeam above the B-pillars, to channel impact forces around the passenger compartment. Ford marketed the system as its &quot;SPACE&quot; Architecture (Side Protection and Cabin Enhancement), what Volvo called its Side Impact Protection System (SIPS). Front frame rails were redesigned to better absorb impact forces, and Volvo also co-engineered collapsible steering columns and roof-mounted airbags. 

Initially, Ford achieved only a tepid market with its D3 vehicles, though after the PAG group divested itself of Volvo, the Fifth Generation Explorer enjoyed broad market success.

Geely was reported to have approached Ford in mid-2008 about a possible takeover of Volvo Cars. On 28 October 2009, Ford named Geely the preferred buyer of Volvo Cars. On 23 December 2009, Ford confirmed that all substantive commercial terms for the sale to Geely had been settled. Geely signed a deal with Ford to acquire Volvo Cars for $1.8 billion on 28 March 2010 and closed the deal on 2 August 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ford.com/about-ford/news-announcements&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="550392" wikidata="Q4839010" url="?curid=550392" title="Back-of-the-envelope calculation">
<text>A back-of-the-envelope calculation is a rough calculation, typically jotted down on any available scrap of paper such as an envelope. It is more than a guess but less than an accurate calculation or mathematical proof. The defining characteristic of back-of-the-envelope calculations is the use of simplified assumptions.

A similar phrase in the U.S. is &quot;back of a napkin&quot;, also used in the business world to describe sketching out a quick, rough idea of a business or product. In British English, a similar idiom is &quot;back of a fag packet&quot;.

== History ==
In the natural sciences, &quot;back-of-the-envelope calculation&quot; is often associated with physicist Enrico Fermi, who was well known for emphasizing ways that complex scientific equations could be approximated within an order of magnitude using simple calculations. He went on to develop a series of sample calculations, which are called &quot;Fermi Questions&quot; or &quot;Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations&quot; and used to solve Fermi problems.

Fermi was known for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. The most famous instance came during the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico on 16 July 1945. As the blast wave reached him, Fermi dropped bits of paper. By measuring the distance they were blown, he could compare to a previously computed table and thus estimate the bomb energy yield. He estimated 10 kilotons of TNT; the measured result was 18.6.

Perhaps the most influential example of such a calculation was carried out over a period of a few hours by Arnold Wilkins after being asked to consider a problem by Robert Watson Watt. Watt had learned that the Germans claimed to have invented a radio-based death ray, but Wilkins&#x27; one-page calculations demonstrated that such a thing was almost certainly impossible. When Watt asked what role radio might play, Wilkins replied that it might be useful for detection at long range, a suggestion that led to the rapid development of radar and the Chain Home system.

Another example is Victor Weisskopf&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Modern Physics from an Elementary Point of View&quot;. In these notes Weisskopf used back-of-the-envelope calculations to calculate the size of a hydrogen atom, a star, and a mountain, all using elementary physics.

== Examples ==
In a video interview for the University of California, Berkeley on the 50th anniversary of the laser, Nobel laureate Charles Townes described how he pulled an envelope from his pocket while sitting in a park and wrote down calculations during his initial insight into lasers.

During lunch with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle in 1966, Tiffany &amp; Co. vice president Oscar Riedner made a sketch on a cocktail napkin of what would become the Vince Lombardi Trophy, awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl.

An important Internet protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol, was sketched out in 1989 by engineers on the back of &quot;three ketchup-stained napkins&quot;, and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.

UTF-8, the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web, was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.

The Bailey bridge is a type of portable, pre-fabricated, truss bridge and was extensively used by British, Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.

The Laffer Curve, which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income, was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.

Upon hearing that the S-IV 2nd Stage of the Saturn I would need transport from California to Florida for launch as part of the Apollo program, Jack Conroy sketched the cavernous cargo airplane, the Pregnant Guppy.

The Video Toaster was designed on placemats in a Topeka pizza restaurant.

<text>Geneseo is a village in and the county seat of Livingston County in the Finger Lakes region of New York, United States, south of Rochester. The name &quot;Geneseo&quot; is an anglicization of the Iroquois name for the earlier Iroquois town there, &quot;Gen-nis-he-yo&quot;, which means &quot;beautiful valley&quot;.

The village of Geneseo lies within the western part of the town of Geneseo at the junction of State Routes 39 and 63 with U.S. Route 20A. The village&#x27;s population was 8,031 at the 2010 census, out of 10,483 in the town. The United States Department of the Interior designated part of the village—the Geneseo Historic District—a National Historic Landmark in 1991.

== History ==
The town of Geneseo was established in 1789, before the formation of Livingston County. Settlement began shortly after James and William Wadsworth arrived in 1790. The brothers came to the Genesee Valley from Connecticut as agents of their uncle, Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth, to care for and sell the land he purchased. The Wadsworths were participants in the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree between Robert Morris and the Senecas at the site of Geneseo in 1797.

Geneseo, as well as nearby Mount Morris, were part of the Morris Reserve that Morris held back from his sale of much of western New York to the Holland Land Company.

The village of Geneseo became the county seat of Livingston County in 1821 and was incorporated in 1832. The State Normal School, now SUNY Geneseo, opened in 1871. A portion of the village was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior in 1991.

By 1835, the village consisted of 83 families, and the streets were Main, Second, North, South, Center and Temple Hill. The village grew steadily, and in the 1850s Elm Street was opened. The advent of the State Normal School in 1871 brought a surge of development, and Oak Street opened in the late 1880s. The private Temple Hill Academy, part of which still stands on Temple Hill Road, educated Chester A. Arthur among others.

During the Civil War, Union soldiers trained at Camp Union, located at what is now the corner of Lima Road and Rorbach Lane. During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was built in Geneseo; it housed mostly Italian soldiers.

=== Present day ===


In its addition of Geneseo to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, the National Park Service said,

The valley of the Genesee is wide and fertile, with some of the best agricultural land in New York, but it was prone to flooding, and Geneseo suffered several bad floods until the Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; construction of the Mount Morris Dam upstream of the community in the 1950s. Agriculture is still a large contributor to Geneseo&#x27;s economy, but many use the area as a bedroom community for jobs in the Rochester area to the north. The village of Geneseo is governed by a mayor and four trustees.

The Association for the Preservation of Geneseo (APOG) is a civic organization dedicated to preserving, improving, and restoring the places of civic, architectural, and historic interest to Geneseo and to educate members of the community to their architectural and historical heritage. Additional aims and purposes are to encourage others to contribute their knowledge, advice, and financial assistance.

In July 2007, &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Geneseo 10th of 25 on its places with the highest percentage of singles, with 65.1% of the 7,500 inhabitants reported to be single.

In addition to the Geneseo Historic District, one individual building, The Homestead, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

One of the village&#x27;s landmarks, a fountain in the middle of Main Street built in the 1880s, was damaged when a tractor trailer crashed into it on April 7, 2016.

==Education==
The Geneseo Central School District encompasses Geneseo and Groveland, and consists of Geneseo Central School, which graduates approximately 75 students each year.

The school mascot is the Blue Devils and teams wear blue and white, with a gray accent color. Past accent colors included red and black.

The school was located on Temple Hill from about 1830 to 1871 when it moved to Center Street. In 1933 it moved to its own building on School Street and in 1963 added a wing. In 1974 it moved into a new building at its present location on Avon Road.

The State University of New York at Geneseo has approximately 5,000 undergraduate students. It is a four-year public liberal arts college, which is one of the top SUNY schools.

<doc id="550403" wikidata="Q1475574" url="?curid=550403" title="Futurama season 1">
<text>The first season of &quot;Futurama&quot; began airing on March 28, 1999 and concluded on November 14, 1999, after 13 episodes.

The original 72-episode run of &quot;Futurama&quot; was &quot;produced&quot; as four seasons; Fox &quot;broadcast&quot; the episodes out of the intended order, resulting in five aired seasons. 
As a consequence, the show&#x27;s canon is disrupted by the &quot;broadcast order&quot;, and more, different regions and networks use different ordering for the episodes.

The list below features the episodes in original &quot;production order&quot;, as featured on the DVD box sets.

The entire season is included within the Volume One DVD box set, which was released on March 25, 2003. The last four episodes were pre-empted by sporting events and pushed into the second broadcast season.

The full thirteen episodes of the season have been released on a box set called &quot;Futurama: Volume One&quot;, on DVD and VHS. It was released in the United Kingdom, on January 28, 2002, in Australia on November 27, 2002 and in the United States and Canada on March 25, 2003. The season was re-released as &quot;Futurama: Volume 1&quot;, with entirely different packaging to match the newer season releases on July 17, 2012.

==Production==

Matt Groening initially conceived of &quot;Futurama&quot; in the mid-1990s. In 1996, he enlisted David X. Cohen, then a &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer and producer, to assist in developing the series; the two then spent time researching science fiction books, television shows, and films of the past. By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and story lines. During that first meeting, Fox ordered thirteen episodes. Shortly after, however, Groening and Fox executives argued over whether the network would have any creative input into the show. With &quot;The Simpsons&quot; the network has no input. Groening explains, &quot;When they tried to give me notes on &quot;Futurama&quot;, I just said: &#x27;No, we&#x27;re going to do this just the way we did &quot;Simpsons&quot;.&#x27; And they said, &#x27;Well, we don&#x27;t do business that way anymore.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Oh, well, that&#x27;s the only way I do business.&#x27;&quot; After negotiations, he received the same independence with &quot;Futurama&quot;. The name &quot;Futurama&quot; comes from a pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, the Futurama pavilion depicted how he imagined the world would look in 1959.

==Reception==
The first season of &quot;Futurama&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Patrick Lee of &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot; commented, based on a viewing of &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot; alone, that &quot;Futurama&quot; was not as funny as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, particularly as &quot;the satire is leavened with treacly sentimental bits about free will and loneliness&quot;. The episode was rated as an &quot;A- pick&quot; and found to &quot;warrant further viewing&quot; despite these concerns. Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; noted that although the series&#x27; premiere contained the same skewed humor as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, it was not as smart and funny, and he attributed this to the large amount of exposition and character introduction required of a television series pilot, noting that the show was &quot;off to a good start.&quot; Andrew Billen of &quot;New Statesman&quot; found the premise of &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot; to be unoriginal, but remained somewhat enthusiastic about the future of the series. While he praised the humorous details of the episode, such as the background scenes while Fry was frozen, he also criticized the show&#x27;s dependence on in-jokes such as Groening&#x27;s head being present in the head museum. The episode was ranked in 2006 by IGN as number 14 in their list of the top 25 &quot;Futurama&quot; episodes. In the 2013/2019 reranking, the episode dropped to number 17. Tal Blevins of IGN had positive review on the season and said &quot;You really can&#x27;t go wrong wherever you look in Futurama Volume One, and there are no stinkers in this collection.&quot; The season tied for 89th in the seasonal ratings tied with Profiler with an average viewership of 8.9 million viewers.

The series&#x27; premiere &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot; garnered &quot;unprecedented strong numbers&quot; with a Nielsen rating of 11.2/17 in homes and 9.6/23 in adults 18–49. The &quot;Futurama&quot; premiere was watched by more people than either its lead-in show (&quot;The Simpsons&quot;) or the show following it (&quot;The X-Files&quot;), and it was the number one show among men aged 18–49 and teenagers for the week.

<doc id="550410" wikidata="Q1761866" url="?curid=550410" title="Puroresu">
<text>is a Japanese term used for professional wrestling in and outside of Japan. The term comes from the Japanese pronunciation of , which in Japanese is abbreviated to “puro” (プロ - “pro”) &amp; “resu” (レス - an abbreviation of “wrestling”). The term became popular among English-speaking fans due to Hisaharu Tanabe&#x27;s activities in the online Usenet community. Growing out of origins in the traditional American style of wrestling, it has become an entity in itself. Japanese pro wrestling is distinct in its psychology and presentation of the sport and how it functions based on Japanese culture. It is treated closer to a legitimate competition, with fewer theatrics; the stories told in Japanese matches are about a fighter&#x27;s spirit and perseverance. Pro wrestling in Japan led to the development of shoot wrestling and has been closely related to mixed martial arts (MMA) starting with Shooto and Pancrase, organizations which predate the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), along with influencing subsequent promotions such as RINGS and PRIDE. It is common for pro wrestlers and mixed martial artists in Japan to cross over.

== Overview ==
Despite some similarities to the popular style of professional wrestling in the United States, Japanese wrestling is known for many differences from the Western style. &quot;Puroresu&quot; in Japan is known for its &quot;fighting spirit&quot; (, &quot;tōkon&quot;), and the wrestlers are known for their full contact strikes. Many Japanese wrestlers have some degree of knowledge in many different martial arts and wrestling styles; because of this, there are usually doctors and trainers at ringside for assisting the wrestlers after a match. Most matches have clean finishes and many of the promotions do not use any angles or gimmicks. Japanese wrestling is also known for its relationship with fellow mixed martial arts promotions. Puroresu remains popular, and it draws huge crowds from the major promotions. With this and its relationship with other martial arts disciplines, the audiences and wrestlers treat puroresu as a combat sport.

It should be also noted that the term &quot;Puroresu&quot; in Japan refers to all professional wrestling, regardless of country of origin. For example, American promotions WWE and Ring of Honor are referred to as &quot;Puroresu&quot; in Japan. Japanese wrestling historian Fumi Saito noted: &quot;Puroresu is completely Japanese-English, and in the U.S. the same word is used for both pro and amateur wrestling. It may be easier to understand if you think of wrestling in the U.S. as having the same nuance as &#x27;sumo&#x27; in Japanese. You call both &#x27;wrestling&#x27; even if it&#x27;s competitive or professional wrestling.&quot;

== Rules ==
Puroresu has a variety of different rules, which can differ greatly from wrestling in other countries. While there is no governing authority for puroresu, there is a general standard which has developed. Each promotion has its own variation, but all are similar enough to avoid confusion. Any convention described here is simply a standard, and may or may not correspond exactly with any given promotion&#x27;s codified rules.

=== General structure ===
Matches are held between two or more sides (&quot;corners&quot;). Each corner may consist of one wrestler, or a team of two or more. Most team matches are governed by tag team rules (see below).

The match is won by scoring a &quot;fall&quot;, which is generally consistent with standard professional wrestling:
* &quot;Pinning&quot; an opponent&#x27;s shoulders to the mat for the referee&#x27;s count of three
* &quot;Submission&quot; victory, which sees the wrestler either tap out or verbally submit to their opponent
* &quot;Knockout&quot;, the failure to regain composure at the referee&#x27;s command
* &quot;Countout&quot;, the failure of a party to return to the ring at the referee&#x27;s command, which is determined by a count of twenty (some federations use ten, but in Japanese wrestling they use twenty)
* &quot;Disqualification&quot;, the act of one wrestler breaking the rules
* &quot;Referee stoppage&quot;, when an official deems a participant unfit to continue wrestling (either pre-planned or due to legitimate injury)

Additional rules govern how the outcome of the match is to take place. One such example would be the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation, as it does not allow pinfall victories in favor of submissions and knockouts; this is seen as an early influence of mixed martial arts, as some wrestlers broke away from traditional wrestling endings to matches in favor of legitimate outcomes. Another example is that most promotions disallow punches, so many wrestlers utilize open handed strikes and stiff forearms; this rule was also applied in the early stages of Pancrase.

== Styles ==
=== &quot;Strong style&quot; ===
New Japan Pro-Wrestling, headed by Antonio Inoki, used Inoki&#x27;s &quot;strong style&quot; approach of wrestling as a combat sport, influenced strongly by the styles of catch wrestlers such as Lou Thesz, Karl Gotch, and Billy Robinson. Wrestlers incorporated kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis was placed on submission wrestling. Inoki became known for &quot;different styles fights&quot; which were predetermined matches against practitioners of various martial arts. This led to a real fight against Muhammad Ali in 1976 that was watched by an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide. Many of New Japan&#x27;s wrestlers, including top stars such as Seiji Sakaguchi, Tatsumi Fujinami, Akira Maeda, Satoru Sayama, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Nobuhiko Takada, Masakatsu Funaki, Masahiro Chono, Shinya Hashimoto, Riki Choshu, Minoru Suzuki, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Keiji Mutoh, came from a legitimate martial arts background. This style led to the development of shoot wrestling and the spin-off Universal Wrestling Federation. Sayama developed and founded Shooto, a pioneer mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, in 1985. That same year, Sayama&#x27;s student Caesar Takeshi founded Shootboxing. Funaki, Suzuki and others would found Pancrase and hold their first event almost two months before UFC 1. Maeda founded RINGS in 1991 as a shoot-style promotion, which began transitioning to legitimate MMA competition in 1995. Takada was a co-founder of PRIDE and Rizin.

=== &quot;Ōdō&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Road&quot;) ===
 is a style which originated in All Japan Pro Wrestling, and is most closely associated with the , the informal Western fan’s nomenclature for 1990s AJPW wrestlers Toshiaki Kawada, Kenta Kobashi, Mitsuharu Misawa, and Akira Taue. However, matches involving these four have been also referred to in Japan as . As opposed to &quot;strong style&#x27;s&quot; European catch wrestling influences, &quot;ōdō&quot; opted for a more &quot;narrative&quot; style, derived from the American model of professional wrestling as physical storytelling. However, &quot;ōdō&quot; distinguished itself from American professional wrestling by largely eschewing many of its storytelling devices. Angles and gimmicks were virtually non-existent, as all the storytelling in &quot;ōdō&quot; occurred through the matches themselves. Blading was also banned outright. Because Baba disliked submissions, they were also eschewed for decisive pinfalls. In 2011, Japanese wrestling magazine &quot;G Spirits&quot; cited Misawa&#x27;s July 29, 1993 Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship title defense against Kawada as the first match in the &quot;Shitennō&quot; style, and the 1993 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League final, in which Misawa and Kobashi wrestled Kawada and Taue, was referred to as the &quot;completed form&quot; of the style by &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; in 2014. According to Kawada, &quot;ōdō&quot; matches, which placed a heavy emphasis on &quot;fighting spirit&quot;, were about &quot;breaking the limit you set in the last&quot;. AJPW referee Kyohei Wada, who recounted that Baba told his talent &quot;whatever you want to do, do it, and whatever you can show the people, show it&quot;, would later compare his job officiating these matches to &quot;conducting a symphony&quot;.

However, this escalation eventually manifested through the use of dangerous maneuvers that focused on the head and neck, particularly during the finishing stretches of &quot;ōdō&quot; matches. The physical consequences of this style, or at least its use of head drops, has often been cited as the underlying reason for Misawa&#x27;s death after an in-ring accident in 2009. Professional wrestling journalist and historian Dave Meltzer noted, after his death, that Misawa &quot;regularly took psychotic bumps&quot;, including back suplexes where he would land on his head. AJPW would steer away from &quot;ōdō&quot; after Misawa led a mass exodus to form Pro Wrestling Noah, particularly when Motoko Baba sold her stock to Keiji Mutoh, but Noah would continue to practice &quot;ōdō&quot; (referred to as Royal Road with Ark by the promotion) in its booking. This element of &quot;ōdō&quot; has been criticized for its negative influence on professional wrestling, and 1990s All Japan been cited as a cautionary tale in response to legitimately dangerous maneuvers. Meltzer wrote in 2009 that head drops were &quot;never necessary&quot; as Misawa and his peers in AJPW were already &quot;having the best matches in wrestling&quot; before they incorporated these maneuvers into their style.

=== Other styles ===
Throughout the 1990s, three individual styles—shoot style, lucha libre, and hardcore—were the main divisions of independent promotions, but as a result of interpromoting, it is not unusual to see all three styles on the same card.

== Joshi puroresu ==
Pro wrestling done by female wrestlers is called &quot;joshi puroresu,&quot; or women’s wrestling, and is usually promoted by companies that specialize in women’s wrestling, rather than divisions of otherwise male-dominated promotions as is the case in the United States (a major exception was FMW, a men&#x27;s promotion which had a small women&#x27;s division, but even then depended on talent from women&#x27;s federations to provide competition). However, &quot;joshi puroresu&quot; promotions usually have agreements with male puroresu promotions such that they recognize each other&#x27;s titles as legitimate, and may share cards.

All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling was the dominant &quot;joshi&quot; organization from the 1970s to the 1990s. AJW&#x27;s first major star was Mach Fumiake in 1974, followed in 1975 by Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda, known as the &quot;Beauty Pair&quot;. The early 1980s saw the fame of Jaguar Yokota and Devil Masami, major stars of the second wave of excellent workers who took the place of the glamour-based &quot;Beauty Pair&quot; generation. That decade would later see the rise of Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka, known as the &quot;Crush Gals&quot;, who as a tag team achieved a level of unprecedented mainstream success in Japan, unheard of by any female wrestler in the history of professional wrestling all over the world. Their long running feud with Dump Matsumoto and her &quot;Gokuaku Domei&quot; (&quot;Atrocious Alliance&quot;) stable would become extremely popular in Japan during the 1980s, with their televised matches resulting in some of the highest rated broadcasts in Japanese television as well as the promotion regularly selling out arenas.

In 1985, Japan&#x27;s second women&#x27;s wrestling promotion formed in Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling. The promotion ran their first show on August 17, 1986. It featured Jackie Sato who returned from retirement and future stars such as Shinobu Kandori, Mayumi Ozaki, Cutie Suzuki, and Dynamite Kansai, who would go on to be top stars in LLPW and JWP.

In 1992, Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling dissolved, splitting into LLPW and JWP. These promotions worked together with FMW and All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling to create a critically acclaimed era with several classic matches authorized by the American wrestling publication &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; featuring wrestlers such as Manami Toyota, Aja Kong, Kyoko Inoue, Bull Nakano, Mayumi Ozaki, Megumi Kudo, Dynamite Kansai, amongst others. This era was also notable for multiple wrestlers returning from retirement such as Chigusa Nagayo, Lioness Asuka, Jaguar Yokota, Devil Masami, and Bison Kimura, which increased interest.

In 2022, New Japan Pro Wrestling inaugurated their own IWGP Women&#x27;s Championship. In 2024 Pro Wrestling NOAH followed with their GHC Women&#x27;s Championship.

<text>An ejido (, from Latin &quot;exitum&quot;) is an area of communal land used for agriculture in which community members have usufruct rights rather than ownership rights to land, which in Mexico is held by the Mexican state. People awarded ejidos in the modern era farm them individually in parcels and collectively maintain communal holdings with government oversight. Although the system of &quot;ejidos&quot; was based on an understanding of the preconquest Aztec calpulli and the medieval Spanish ejido, since the 20th century ejidos have been managed and controlled by the government.

After the Mexican Revolution, &quot;ejidos&quot; were created by the Mexican state to grant lands to peasant communities as a means to stem social unrest. As Mexico prepared to enter the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1991, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declared the end of awarding ejidos and allowed existing ejidos to be rented or sold, ending land reform in Mexico.

==Colonial-era indigenous community land holdings==
In central Mexico following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire (1519-1521), indigenous communities remained largely intact, including their system of land tenure. The Spanish crown guaranteed that indigenous communities had land under its control, the &quot;&quot;. It also established the General Indian Court so that individual natives and indigenous communities could defend their rights against Spanish encroachment. Spaniards applied their own terminology to indigenous community lands, and early in the colonial era began calling them ejidos.

==Nineteenth century==
Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in 1821, following the Mexican War of Independence. The new sovereign nation abolished crown protections of natives and indigenous communities, making them equal before the law rather than vassals of the Spanish crown. The disappearance of the General Indian Court was one effect of independence. With political instability and economic stagnation following independence, indigenous communities largely maintained their land holdings, since large landed estates were not expanding to increase production.

For nineteenth-century Mexican liberals, the continuing separateness of natives and indigenous villages from the Mexican nation was deemed &quot;The Indian Problem,&quot; and the breakup of communal landholding was identified as the key to integrating Indians into the Mexican nation. When the Liberals came to power in 1855, they embarked on a major reform that included the expropriation and sale of corporate lands, that is, those held by indigenous communities and by the Roman Catholic Church. The Liberal Reform first put in place the Lerdo Law, calling for the end of corporate landholding, and then incorporated that law into the Constitution of 1857. Ejidos were thus legally abolished, although many continued to survive. Mexico was plunged into civil unrest, civil war, and a foreign invasion by the French. Land reform did not begin to take effect until the expulsion of the French in 1867 and the restoration of the Mexican republic under Liberal control. Under liberal general Porfirio Díaz, who seized power through a coup in 1876, policies aimed at promoting political stability and economic prosperity with the motto &quot;order and progress&quot; led to the expansion of large haciendas, forcing many villages to lose their lands and leaving the peasantry landless.

==Twentieth century==
Many peasants participated in the Mexican Revolution, with the expectation that their village lands could be restored. In particular, many peasants in the state of Morelos under the leadership of Emiliano Zapata waged war against the presidency of Francisco I. Madero, a wealthy landowner whose reformist political movement sought to oust the regime of Porfirio Díaz; Victoriano Huerta, the leader of a reactionary coup that ousted and assassinated Madero; and Venustiano Carranza, a wealthy landowner who led the Constitutionalist faction, which defeated all others. In 1917, a new Constitution was drafted, which included empowerment of the government to expropriate privately held resources. Many peasants expected Article 27 of the Constitution to bring about the breakup of large haciendas and to return land to peasant communities. Carranza was entirely resistant to the expropriation of haciendas, and in fact returned many to their owners that had been seized by revolutionaries.

Distribution of large amounts of land did not begin until Lázaro Cárdenas became president in 1934. The &quot;ejido&quot; system was introduced as an important component of the land reform in Mexico. Under Cárdenas, land reform was &quot;sweeping, rapid, and, in some respects, structurally innovative... he promoted the collective ejido (hitherto a rare institution) in order to justify the expropriation of large commercial estates.&quot;

The typical procedure for the establishment of an ejido involved the following steps: 
# landless farmers who leased lands from wealthy landlords would petition the federal government for the creation of an ejido in their general area;
#the federal government would consult with the landlord;
#the land would be expropriated from the landlords if the government approved the ejido; and
#an ejido would be established and the original petitioners would be designated as &quot;ejidatarios&quot; with certain cultivation/use rights. 
Ejidatarios do not own the land but are allowed to use their allotted parcels indefinitely as long as they do not fail to use the land for more than two years. They can pass their rights on to their children.

==Criticism==

Opponents of the ejido system pointed to widespread corruption within the &quot;Banco Nacional de Crédito Rural&quot; (Banrural)—the primary institution responsible for providing loans to &quot;ejidatarios&quot;—illegal sales and transfers of ejido lands, ecological degradation, and low productivity as evidence of the system&#x27;s failure. Proponents countered these arguments by pointing out that every administration since that of Cárdenas had been either indifferent or openly hostile to ejidos, that the land assigned to ejidos was often of lower quality and inherently less productive than privately held land. Also, the majority of agricultural research and support was biased towards large-scale commercial enterprises. The politicians complaining about Banrural were the people responsible for the corruption, and regardless of its productivity, subsistence production is an important survival strategy for many peasants.

==Change==
As part of a larger program of neoliberal economic restructuring that had already been weakening support for ejidal and other forms of small-scale agriculture and negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1992 pushed legislation through Congress that modified article 27 of the Mexican Constitution to permit the privatization and the sale of ejidal land. This was a direct cause of the Chiapas conflict.

The changes to the ejidal system have largely failed to improve ejidal productivity, and have been implicated as significant contributing factors to worsening rural poverty, forced migration, and the conversion of Mexico, where the cultivation of maize originated, into a net importer of maize and food in general.

The majority of peasants were part of the ejido system with a male figure being the head of the household. On ejido land job opportunities were limited creating a push for the male figures to migrate to the United States in order to support their households and land. US job opportunities for Mexican migrants would include agricultural sectors which contributed to further development of the ejido land and growing agricultural technology. Those who lived on ejido land but did not own the land were more inclined to leave the rural land as well. After these male figures would leave the household the families left behind would consist of the wife and her husband&#x27;s family, which allowed women increased participation in household decision-making in the absence of male figures.

<doc id="550422" wikidata="Q70208" url="?curid=550422" title="Municipalities of Switzerland">
<text>Municipalities (, &#x27; or&#x27;; ; ; ) are the lowest level of administrative division in Switzerland. Each municipality is part of one of the Swiss cantons, which form the Swiss Confederation. In most cantons, municipalities are also part of districts or other sub-cantonal administrative divisions.

There are 2,131 municipalities . Their populations range between several hundred thousand (Zürich), and a few dozen people (Kammersrohr, Bister), and their territory between 0.32 km² (Rivaz) and 439 km² (Scuol).

==History==
The beginnings of the modern municipality system date back to the Helvetic Republic. Under the Old Swiss Confederacy, citizenship was granted by each town and village to only residents. These citizens enjoyed access to community property and in some cases additional protection under the law. Additionally, the urban towns and the rural villages had differing rights and laws. The creation of a uniform Swiss citizenship, which applied equally for citizens of the old towns and their tenants and servants, led to conflict. The wealthier villagers and urban citizens held rights to forests, common land and other municipal property which they did not want to share with the &quot;new citizens&quot;, who were generally poor. The compromise solution, which was written into the municipal laws of the Helvetic Republic, is still valid today. Two politically separate but often geographically similar organizations were created. The first, the so-called municipality, was a political community formed by election and its voting body consists of all resident citizens. However, the community land and property remained with the former local citizens who were gathered together into the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot;/bourgeoisie. During the Mediation era (1803–1814), and especially during the Restoration era (1814–1830), many of the gains toward uniform citizenship were lost. Many political municipalities were abolished and limits were placed on the exercise of political rights for everyone except the members of the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot;. In the Regeneration era (1830–1848), the liberal revolutions of the common people helped to restore some rights again in a few cantons. In other cantons, the &quot;Bürgergemeinden&quot; were able to maintain power as political communities. In the city of Zürich it was not until the Municipal Act of 1866 that the political municipality came back into existence.

The relationship between the political municipality and the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; was often dominated by the latter&#x27;s ownership of community property. Often the administration and profit from the property were totally held by the &quot;Bürgergemeinden&quot;, leaving the political municipality dependent on the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; for money and use of the property. It was not until the political municipality acquired rights over property that served the public (such as schools, fire stations, etc.) and taxes, that they obtained full independence. For example, in the city of Bern, it was not until after the property division of 1852 that the political municipality had the right to levy taxes.

It was not until the Federal Constitution of 1874 that all Swiss citizens were granted equal political rights on local and Federal levels. This revised constitution finally removed all the political voting and electoral body rights from the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot;. In the cities, the percentage of members in the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; in the population was reduced as a result of increasing emigration to the cities. This led to the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; losing its former importance to a large extent. However, the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; has remained, and it includes all individuals who are citizens of the &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot;, usually by having inherited the &quot;Bürgerrecht&quot; (citizenship), regardless of where they were born or where they may currently live. Instead of the place of birth, Swiss legal documents, e.g. passports, contain the &quot;Bürgerort&quot; (place of citizenship, or place of origin). The &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; also often holds and administers the common property in the village for the members of the community.

==Structure and responsibilities==
Each canton determines the powers and responsibilities of its municipalities. These may include providing local government services such as education, medical and social services, public transportation, and tax collection. The degree of centralization varies from one canton to another. The federal constitution protects the autonomy of municipalities within the framework set out by cantonal law.

Municipalities are generally governed by an executive council headed by a president or mayor. Legislative authority is exercised by a town meeting of all citizens, or by a municipal parliament, depending on the size of the municipality, and on cantonal and municipal law. In some cantons, foreigners who have lived for a certain time in Switzerland are also allowed to participate in municipal politics. As at the cantonal and federal level, citizens enjoy political rights, including direct democratic ones, in their municipality.

Municipalities are financed through direct taxes (such as income tax), with rates varying more or less within a framework set by the canton (see Taxation in Switzerland). As among the cantons, there is a tax transfer among the municipalities to balance various levels of tax income.

==Size and designations==
Switzerland has a relatively high number of small municipalities, with a population of 1,000 or less, especially in rural areas. Because of the increasing difficulty in providing professional government services and in finding volunteers for political offices in small municipalities, the cantons tend to encourage voluntary mergers of municipalities. This led to the number of municipalities dropping by 384 between the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2019.

Some municipalities designate themselves as &quot;city&quot; (&quot;ville&quot; or &quot;Stadt&quot;) or as &quot;village&quot; (&quot;Dorf&quot;). These designations result from tradition or local preference – for example, several small municipalities designated as cities held city rights in medieval times – and normally do not impact the legal or political rights or obligations of the municipalities under cantonal or federal law.

Municipalities are numbered by the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics (see &quot;Community Identification Number#Switzerland&quot;). One or more postal codes (PLZ/NPA) can by assigned to a municipality or shared with other municipalities.

===List of municipalities by population (2011–21)===
Between 2011 and 2021 nine of the smallest municipalities merged into others as part of the effort to eliminate the smallest communities. Only Bister has not merged into a new municipality although the smallest municipality is now Kammersrohr with a population of just 32. 




==Lists of municipalities by canton==

==Other local subdivisions and entities==
In addition to the municipalities as basic territorial political subdivisions, a number of other local subdivisions exist in several cantons. These include:
* Bürgergemeinde (also: Burgergemeinde, Ortsgemeinde, Ortsbürgergemeinde, Tagwen, bourgeoisie, commune bourgeoise, vischnanca burgaisa), a statutory corporation that includes everyone who is a citizen of a commune and has the &quot;Heimatrecht&quot; (home right) in that commune regardless of where they may currently live. Until the 19th century this &quot;Heimatrecht&quot; included rights to use the commons, which were administered by the Bürgergemeinde. Modernly, some Bürgergemeinden may still control common property, but the &quot;Heimatrecht&quot; and associated &quot;Heimatort&quot; is used just as place of birth in other countries.
* Gemischte Gemeinde (mixed communes), found in the Canton of Jura and portions of the Canton of Bern, a combination of a Bürgergemeinde and a political commune.
* Korporationsgemeinde, a legally recognized cooperative in Central Switzerland that controls some land and is responsible for its members support.
* Kirchgemeinde, a parish for members of a large church (generally Roman Catholic or Swiss Reformed). There may be two or more &quot;Kirchgemeinden&quot; in a single municipality.
* Schulgemeinde, similar to a school district.
* Bäuert, in the Berner Oberland or Graubünden) a small farming community. It is a type of agricultural cooperative with shared equipment and land.
* Degagna, in the Leventina valley in the Canton of Ticino. It manages shared pastures, fields and woods as well as maintaining roads that cross the common land.

<doc id="550427" wikidata="Q7402134" url="?curid=550427" title="Saint Regis University">
<text>Saint Regis University, sometimes styled as St. Regis University, was a diploma mill operation that was one of about 120 connected institutions operated by an American fraud ring from about 1999 until 2005, when it was shut down by U.S. government authorities. The operation was known as &quot;Operation Gold Seal&quot;.

The Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization identified Saint Regis University as a diploma mill linked to 18 other front &quot;schools&quot;. The school issued degrees based on &quot;life experience&quot; instead of requiring the taking of academic classes or a formal course of study. It sold both college degrees and high school diplomas.

In 2006 the Associated Press reported that &quot;at least 135 federal employees&quot; held bogus degrees from the Saint Regis operation. This included a White House staffer, a State Department employee in Kuwait, and a Department of Justice employee in Spokane, Washington.

==Operation and history==
In November 2005, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; noted that prosecutors discovered the university formed part of an elaborate online scam masterminded by a former real estate agent called &quot;Dixie&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;Dixie Ellen Randock, her husband, Steven Karl Randock Sr, and six alleged accomplices were indicted after a US Secret Service sting. Experts say the group was one of the biggest fish in the booming $1 billion (£584 million) a year phony degree and diploma-granting racket.&quot;

The ring began operating in 1999 and during its operation sold more than $7 million worth of phony high school diplomas and undergraduate and graduate degrees to people in more than 130 countries. In addition to Saint Regis, the ring operated under the names of Ameritech University, Pan America University, James Monroe University, James Monroe High School, All Saints American University, New Manhattan University, and others.

Dixie E. and Stephen K. Randock Sr. were indicted in October 2005 on charges of conspiring to commit fraud and laundering nearly $2 million in diploma mill receipts from 2002 to 2005. The indictment also brought charges against Richard Novak, Heidi Kae Lorhan, Blake Carlson, Roberta Markishtum, Kenneth Pearson, and Amy Hensley. Dixie Randock, Steven Randock, Heidi Lorhan, and Blake Carlson entered guilty pleas to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud in a U.S. District Court in Washington in March 2008. Ultimately all eight defendants chose to plead guilty.

In July 2008 Dixie Randock was sentenced to three years in prison. Her daughter was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, and Randock&#x27;s husband was sentenced to three years in August 2008. Others involved were also sentenced in 2008.

On January 31, 2007, the New York City Department of Investigation reported that several members of the New York City Fire Department had used &quot;phony degrees&quot; from St. Regis University to qualify for promotions. Fourteen firefighters received disciplinary fines as a result.

==Investigations and litigation==
===Teachers in Georgia===
Saint Regis University made national news when 11 teachers in Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States were found using degrees from this institution to increase their salaries. In July 2004, the Georgia Professional Standards Commission revoked the licenses of all 11 teachers. When it was discovered St. Regis University was a diploma mill, six teachers resigned. Georgia officials accepted those credentials because of letters they received from a credential evaluator, Career Consultants International in Sunrise, Florida. CCI said the credentials were equal to those from a regionally accredited U.S. university. The officials now suspect that CCI was not giving independent evaluations, according to the Georgia Professional Standards Commission executive secretary, F.D. Toth. Toth said the commission received letters from CCI for 11 of the 12 educators, stating that their Saint Regis degrees met the same rigor and content standards as do those from regionally accredited U.S. colleges and universities, which is the standard for Georgia&#x27;s recognition of degrees.

CCI is part of National Success Marketing Inc., based in Sunrise, Florida, and owned by Sheila Danzig and William H. Danzig. Sheila Danzig described a relationship with Saint Regis that throws into question the company&#x27;s objectivity as an evaluator of credentials. She said her company receives a fee, paid by Saint Regis, every time CCI evaluates the academic credentials of one of its students. Danzig also said she was a paid consultant to Saint Regis.

===Liberian controversy===
CCI is currently operating under the name &quot;The Degree People&quot;. Calls to the ministry of education of Liberia resulted in callers being told that SRU was accredited. Later it was learned that the accreditation was part of a bribery scheme but no one in Liberia appeared to be punished. CCI withdrew all SRU evaluations as soon as this scheme was revealed.

The operators &quot;falsely asserted&quot; Liberian and Indian government approval and actually operated &quot;mainly from State of Washington but may have operations elsewhere&quot;. The Oregon office notes the linkages between James Monroe International University (aka James Monroe University), St. Regis University, Robertstown University, and over 15 other named institutions.

On October 4, 2004 the Liberian Embassy in Washington, D.C. posted the message &quot;URGENT DISCLAIMER ON THE ILLEGAL ESTABLISHMENT AND RECOGNITION OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA&quot; declaring &quot;null and void whatever documents St. Regis University may claim to possess emanating from the [National] Commission [of Higher Education].&quot;

The regionally accredited Regis University of Denver, Colorado filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against St. Regis on December 6, 2004. This action, case no. CV-04-462-RHW, was publicly filed in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Washington State. Most St. Regis academic material was transferred to the James Monroe University site after the lawsuit was filed. A few months later the domain administrator for .lr (Liberia) internet domains cancelled saintregis.edu.lr, in effect eliminating the Web presence of St. Regis.

===Arrests and convictions===
In October 2005 the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington announced the indictments of eight alleged operators of St. Regis. Charged with violations of Title 18 of the United States Code were Dixie Randock, Steven Randock Sr., Blake Carlson, Richard Novak, Heidi Lorhan, Amy Hensley, Roberta Markishtum, and Kenneth Pearson. In January 2006 Pearson was also indicted for possession and receipt of child pornography, a federal felony. According to prosecutors, four computers seized from Pearson&#x27;s home in association with the diploma mill investigation were found to contain more than 10,000 sexually explicit images of children.

Carlson pleaded guilty to one Class D felony count of &quot;Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud&quot; on March 7, 2006. Novak pleaded guilty to one Class D felony count of &quot;Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud and Mail Fraud and to Violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&quot; and a second Class D felony count of &quot;Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&quot; on March 20, 2006. In his plea agreement, Novak said he had paid Liberian officials $44,000 in return for allowing the operation to claim accreditation in Liberia. Pearson pleaded guilty on October 10, 2006 to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and one count of receipt of child pornography.

===United States government employees===
In October 2006, the Associated Press reported that employees of the federal government in the United States had received diplomas from St. Regis and its affiliates. Though they have not been identified by name, the employees reportedly included a White House staff member, National Security Agency employees, a senior State Department official, and a Department of Justice employee.

On July 31, 2008 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; announced that it had obtained a list of 9,600 names of people who had inquired into or purchased degrees from the diploma mill. Two-hundred ninety-four of the names were of people living in the Virginia, Maryland, or District of Columbia area with 20 of them appearing to be military members and 10 government employees or government contractors.

===Washington state employees===
In 2009, a social worker and two counselors in the state of Washington were accused of misrepresenting their professional credentials by using &quot;fake degrees&quot; from Saint Regis.

==James Monroe International University==

James Monroe International University, formerly known as James Monroe University, claimed to be based in Seborga and have accreditation from the Minister of Education in Seborga and from the Distance Education Council (DEC) of India. Previously it claimed to be in Liberia and accredited by the Liberian government. It was revealed to be run by some of the same operators as Saint Regis University.

===CNN coverage===
On December 15, 2005, CNN aired a report on diploma mills and terrorism. The reported explained that &quot;H-1B visas can be issued to anyone who is highly skilled and can get a job in the U.S. During the report, United States Attorney James McDevitt voiced concerns that a phony advanced degree could be the first step for someone in a terrorist sleeper cell.&quot;

The report explained how the United States Secret Service &quot;bought their own degree for a perfect terrorist candidate, although theirs was fictional.&quot; The person was &quot;Mohammed Syed&quot;, who had no formal education, but chemical training and chemical engineering with the Syrian army. &quot;The Secret Service even added to Syed&#x27;s application that he needed a degree quickly, so he could find employment and obtain an H-1B visa, allowing him to stay in the US.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;In less than a month, the imaginary Syrian army expert was notified James Monroe University was awarding him three advanced degrees in engineering and chemistry, all for $1,277&quot;. From the CNN report: &quot;What is surprising is just how this potential hole in homeland security was discovered. It turns out, the fake universities selling fake degrees were done in by a real physics professor from the fully-accredited University of Illinois, who was conducting more of his own investigation than a research project.&quot;

Congressional interest in the case prompted US Congresswoman Betty McCollum and two of her colleagues to draft anti-diploma mill legislation. They sought the assistance of Vice Presidents of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, as well as Alan Contreras of Oregon&#x27;s Office of Degree Authorization and George Gollin, a CHEA Board of Directors member and University of Illinois professor.

==Robertstown University==
Robertstown University formerly claimed that it was in Liberia and was accredited by the Liberian Government. It was to be closed until the issues involving its accreditation by the Liberian government were resolved. However, it was later revealed to be run by the same operators as Saint Regis University.

<doc id="550433" wikidata="Q2117840" url="?curid=550433" title="Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing">
<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing is one of the fourteen American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Journalism. It has been awarded since 1917 for distinguished editorial writing, the test of excellence being clearness of style, moral purpose, sound reasoning, and power to influence public opinion in what the writer conceives to be the right direction. Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year. The program has also recognized opinion journalism with its Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning from 1922.

Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner. 

One person ordinarily wins the award for work with one newspaper or with affiliated papers, and that was true without exception between 1936 (the only time two prizes were given) and 1977. In the early years, several newspapers were recognized without naming any writer, and that has occasionally happened recently. Several times from 1977, two or three people have shared the award for their work with one paper. 

==Winners and citations==
In its first 97 years to 2013, the Editorial Writing Pulitzer was awarded 89 times. In nine years there was no award given and there were two prizes in 1936. No one has won it twice.

<doc id="550443" wikidata="Q7990732" url="?curid=550443" title="Whassup?">
<text>Whassup? (also known as Wazzup) was a commercial campaign for Budweiser beer from 1999 to 2002. The first spot aired during &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on December 20, 1999. The ad campaign ran in much of the world and became a pop culture catchphrase, comically &quot;&quot;.

==Origins==
The commercials were based on the short film &quot;True&quot; written and directed by Charles Stone III, featuring Stone and several of his childhood friends: Fred Thomas, Paul Williams, Terry Williams, Jimmy &quot;Puerto Rock&quot; Perez, and Kevin Lofton. The characters sat around talking on the phone and saying &quot;whassup?&quot; to one another in a comical way. Steve Weinshel from C&amp;C STORM films sent the popular short film to creative director Vinny Warren and art director Chuck Taylor at the Chicago-based ad agency DDB. They then presented the concept to August Busch IV, vice president of Anheuser-Busch. Impressed, Busch IV licensed the idea from C&amp;C Storm films and enlisted Stone as the director for Budweiser TV commercials inspired by the film. Scott Martin Brooks won the role of Dookie when Kevin Lofton declined to audition.

==Accolades==
&quot;Whassup?&quot; was awarded the Cannes Grand Prix award and the Grand Clio award, among others. The campaign was inducted into the CLIO Hall of Fame in May 2006.

==Sequels==
In 2000, Budweiser created a sequel entitled &quot;Whassup Girlfriend&quot; featuring the original cast, with one member watching a program with his girlfriend when his friends call. 

In 2001, during Super Bowl XXXV, Budweiser aired two more sequels. One, titled &quot;Whassup Come Home&quot;, features an alien who returns to his mothership and is asked what he has learned during his time on Earth, to which he responds, &quot;Whassuuuuuuuuuuup.&quot; The other, titled &quot;What Are You Doing?&quot;, is a direct parody of the original commercial but instead featuring a cast of yuppies who utter the phrase, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; instead of, &quot;Whassup?&quot;

Eight years after it first aired, Stone rebooted the ad, with the same cast, as &quot;Wassup 2000&quot;. The two-minute short film was heavily critical of the presidency of George W. Bush and was a clear endorsement of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. The 2008 video was nominated for the Favorite User Generated Video award at the 35th People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

In 2020 a new ad campaign &quot;Checking in, that&#x27;s Whassup&quot; was created by VaynerMedia. Social media spots featured friends meeting on an online platform, a common occurrence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The campaign encouraged viewers to check in with friends, and received a Bronze award from the Clio Sports program.

== Cultural influence ==

The campaign was notably parodied in the 2000 comedy horror film &quot;Scary Movie&quot;.

&quot;WWE&quot; tag team &quot;The Dudley Boyz&quot; would notably use the “Whassup” joke during their “Diving Headbutt” signature move going as far back as 2000.

The campaign phrase “Whassup” is featured prominently as a sample and used in the song &quot;그녀를 일으켜라 Get Her Up&quot; by Yoo Young-jin from his 2001 album &quot;Agape&quot;.

The first episode uploaded to the &quot;Annoying Orange&quot; YouTube channel directly parodies the original commercial, itself a remake of the short film &quot;True&quot;; the video features the titular orange, a banana &quot;just hanging around, with [its] bud&quot;, a lemon taking the role of Fred Thomas, a kiwi taking the role of Dookie (though not the name), and an apple (who gets cut in half towards the end of the video, much to the other fruits&#x27; horror) taking the role of Terry Williams. Its direct sequel, &quot;Wasssabi&quot;, is a parody of the ad &quot;Wasabi&quot; and stars Orange, Pear, a different lemon, two pieces of sushi, a small blob of wasabi that gets mixed into a bowl of soy sauce towards the end of the video (once again, to the horror of the other foods), and a bottle of paprika that appears at the very end of the video and groans at Orange using the word &quot;paprika&quot; as he did &quot;wasabi&quot;; while the video &quot;Wazzup Blowup&quot; references the campaign&#x27;s use of telephones, with Orange, Midget Apple, Pear, Marshmallow, Grapefruit, and Grandpa Lemon gradually annoying a corn cob until it explodes into a shower of popcorn. A direct sequel to &quot;Wasssabi&quot;, &quot;Wazzup 3: Bonsai Tree&quot;, and the video &quot;WazZOOM&quot; also reference the campaign phrase &quot;Wazzup&quot;. The video &quot;Wasabi Goatee Party!!!&quot; references the original &quot;Wazzup&quot; video by &quot;Annoying Orange&quot;, while the video &quot;FROYOLO!&quot; serves as a spiritual successor; the campaign phrase &quot;Wazzup&quot; remains a staple of the channel, particularly in &quot;Ask Orange&quot; videos.

<text>Peter von Zahn (29 January 1913 – 26 July 2001) was a German author, film maker, and journalist.

Born in Chemnitz as a son of an officer, he grew up in Dresden and studied law, history, and philosophy. He was drafted at the beginning of World War II. After the war, he was one of the founders of the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR). For three years, he managed the NWDR Studio in Düsseldorf where he introduced Anglo-Saxon style journalism with self-critical irony.

In 1951, he went to the United States as a foreign correspondent. He worked until a very advanced age and produced over 3000 radio shows and 1000 television films.

He received many awards such as the Adolf-Grimme-Preis (3), the DAG-Fernsehpreis in Silver and Gold, the Goldene Kamera and the Bavarian TV Award, and is considered the standard for subsequent radio and television journalism. The State of Hamburg promoted him in 1995 to a Professor honoris causa.

He died in Hamburg aged 88.

<doc id="550445" wikidata="Q21441825" url="?curid=550445" title="Fusobacteriota">
<text>Fusobacteriota are obligately anaerobic non-sporeforming Gram-negative bacilli. Since the first reports in the late nineteenth century, various names have been applied to these organisms, sometimes with the same name being applied to different species. More recently, not only have there been changes to the nomenclature, but also attempts to differentiate between species which are believed to be either pathogenic or commensal or both. Because of their asaccharolytic nature, and a general paucity of positive results in routine biochemical tests, laboratory identification of the Fusobacteriota has been difficult. However, the application of novel molecular biological techniques to taxonomy has established a number of new species, together with the subspeciation of &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot; and &quot;F. nucleatum&quot;, and provided new methods for identification. The involvement of Fusobacteriota in a wide spectrum of human infections causing tissue necrosis and septicaemia has long been recognised, and, more recently, their importance in intra-amniotic infections, premature labour and tropical ulcers has been reported.

Since the first reports of Fusobacteriota in the late nineteenth century, the variety of species names has led to some confusion within the genera &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; and &quot;Leptotrichia&quot;. However, newer methods of investigation have led to a better understanding of the taxonomy, with the description of several new species of Fusobacteriota. Among the new species described are &quot;F. ulcerans&quot; from tropical ulcers, and several species from the oral cavity. Subspeciation of the important species &quot;F. necrophorum&quot; and &quot;F. nucleatum&quot; has also been possible. It is probable that the taxonomy of the Fusobacteriota may be further developed in the future.

It is the sole phylum in the kingdom Fusobacteriati.

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

== Role in Human Disease ==
New evidence is emerging that this bacterium may cause or be related to human colon cancer. In 2011 investigators reported the presence of Fusobacteriota in colon cancer tissue (Genome Res 2012; 22:292) and a new multicenter study provides evidence that some cases-particularly right-sided might be caused by infection by Fusobacteriota.

<text>Plug was a British comic magazine that ran for 75 issues from 24 September 1977 until 24 February 1979, when it merged with &quot;The Beezer&quot;. It was edited by Ian Gray.

A spin-off from &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; comic strip in &quot;The Beano&quot;, the comic was based on the character Plug who was a distinctively ugly member of the Bash Street Kids. His dog (Pug) from &quot;Pup Parade&quot;, and a new character called &quot;Chunkee the Monkey&quot; (Plug&#x27;s pet monkey) accompanied him. Vic Neill mainly drew the title character&#x27;s strip. The comic also had its own fan club, the &quot;Plug Sports and Social Club&quot;. The comic was inspired in part by &quot;Mad&quot;.

The &quot;Plug&quot; comic was never a big hit, possibly because, at 9 pence, it was too expensive compared to other D. C. Thomson comics at the time, which were priced at around 5 pence. According to the 2008 book &quot;The History of the Beano&quot;, for a while there were rumours of a &quot;curse of &quot;Plug&quot;&quot;, fuelled by the fact that a number of celebrities featured in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine-style caricatures on the comic&#x27;s cover died soon after, most notably John Wayne. However, the strip&#x27;s use of gravure painting is still used in comics today.

<text>Cream cheese is a soft, usually mild-tasting fresh cheese made from milk and cream. Cream cheese is not naturally matured and is meant to be consumed fresh, so it differs from other soft cheeses such as Brie and Neufchâtel. It is more comparable in taste, texture, and production methods to Boursin and mascarpone. Stabilizers such as carob bean gum and carrageenan are often added in industrial production.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines cream cheese as containing at least 33% milk fat with a moisture content of not more than 55%, and a pH range of 4.4 to 4.9. Similarly, under Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, cream cheese must contain at least 30% milk fat and a maximum of 55% moisture. In other countries, it is defined differently and may need a considerably higher fat content.

Cream cheese originated in the United States in the 1870s.

==Origin==
===United States===
Around 1873, William A. Lawrence, a dairyman in Chester, New York, was the first to mass produce an unripened fresh cheese known generically as cream cheese. In 1872, he began manufacturing Neufchâtel cheese. By adding cream to the process, he developed a richer cheese that he called &quot;cream cheese&quot;. In 1877, Lawrence created the first brand of cream cheese; its logo was a silhouette of a cow followed by the words &quot;Neufchatel &amp; Cream Cheese&quot;. 

In 1879, to build a larger factory, Lawrence entered into an arrangement with Samuel S. Durland, another Chester merchant. In 1880, Alvah Reynolds, a New York cheese distributor, began to sell the cheese of Lawrence &amp; Durland and called it &quot;Philadelphia Cream Cheese&quot;. Histories that imply the cheese was produced in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Philadelphia, New York, are incorrect. By the end of 1880, faced with increasing demand for his Philadelphia-brand cheese, Reynolds turned to Charles Green, a second Chester dairyman, who by 1880 had been manufacturing cream cheese as well. Some of Green&#x27;s cheese was also sold under the Philadelphia label. 

In 1892, Reynolds bought the Empire Cheese Co. of South Edmeston, New York, to produce cheese under his &quot;Philadelphia&quot; label. When the Empire factory burned down in 1900, he asked the newly formed Phenix Cheese Company to produce his cheese, instead. In 1903, Reynolds sold rights to the &quot;Philadelphia&quot; brand name to the Phenix Cheese Company, which was under the direction of Jason F. Whitney, Sr. (which later merged with Kraft, in 1928). By the early 1880s, Star cream cheese had emerged as Lawrence &amp; Durland&#x27;s brand, and Green made World and Globe brands of the cheese. At the turn of the 20th century, New York dairymen were producing cream cheese sold under such other brands as Triple Cream (C. Percival), Eagle (F.X. Baumert), Empire (Phenix Cheese Co.), Mohican (International Cheese Co.), Monroe Cheese Co. (Gross &amp; Hoffman), and Nabob (F.H. Legget).
Cream cheese is common in the Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine of New York City, where it is known as a &quot;schmear&quot;. It is the basis of the bagel and cream cheese, an open-faced sandwich. Lox, capers, and other ingredients may be added to this food.

===Canada===
Industrial cream cheeses, such as the Philadelphia brand, are the most commonly found varieties, but traditional fresh cream cheeses not containing stabilizers or preservatives maintain a presence in the Canadian market.

==Manufacture==
Normally, protein molecules in milk have a negative surface charge, which keeps milk in a liquid state; the molecules act as surfactants, forming micelles around the particles of fat and keeping them in emulsion. Lactic acid bacteria are added to pasteurized and homogenized milk. During the fermentation around , the pH of the blend decreases (acidifies). Amino acids at the surface of the proteins begin losing charge and become neutral, turning the fat micelles from hydrophilic to hydrophobic state and causing the liquid to coagulate. If the bacteria are left in the milk too long, the pH lowers further, the micelles attain a positive charge, and the mixture returns to liquid form. The key, then, is to kill the bacteria by heating the mixture to at the moment the cheese is at the isoelectric point, meaning the state at which half the ionizable surface amino acids of the proteins are positively charged and half are negative.

Inaccurate timing of the heating can produce inferior or unsalable cheese due to variations in flavor and texture. Cream cheese has a higher fat content than other cheeses, and fat repels water, which tends to separate from the cheese; this can be avoided in commercial production by adding stabilizers such as guar or carob gums to prolong its shelf life.

In Canada, the regulations for cream cheese stipulate that it be made by coagulating cream with the help of bacteria, forming a curd, which is then formed into a mass after removing the whey. Some of its ingredients include cream (to adjust milk fat content), salt, nitrogen (to improve spreadability) and several gelling, thickening, stabilizing, and emulsifying ingredients such as xanthan gum or gelatin, to a maximum of 0.5%. Regulations on preservatives used are that either sorbic acid or propionic acid may be used independently or combined, but only to a maximum of 3,000 parts per million when used together. The only acceptable enzymes that can be used in manufacturing of cream cheese to be sold in Canada are chymosin A and B, pepsin, and rennet.

In Spain and Mexico, cream cheese is sometimes called by the generic name &quot;queso filadelfia&quot;, following the marketing of Philadelphia-branded cream cheese by Kraft Foods.

Cream cheese is easy to make at home, and many methods and recipes are used. Consistent, reliable, commercial manufacture is more difficult.

American cream cheese tends to have lower fat content than elsewhere, but &quot;Philadelphia&quot; branded cheese is suggested as a substitute for &quot;petit suisse&quot; by Julia Child.

<doc id="550450" wikidata="Q422075" url="?curid=550450" title="Cristobalite">
<text>Cristobalite () is a mineral polymorph of silica that is formed at very high temperatures. It has the same chemical formula as quartz, SiO2, but a distinct crystal structure. Both quartz and cristobalite are polymorphs with all the members of the quartz group, which also include coesite, tridymite and stishovite. It is named after Cerro San Cristóbal in Pachuca Municipality, Hidalgo, Mexico.

It is used in dentistry as a component of alginate impression materials as well as for making models of teeth.

== Properties ==

=== Metastability ===
Cristobalite is stable only above 1470 °C, but can crystallize and persist metastably at lower temperatures. The persistence of cristobalite outside its thermodynamic stability range occurs because the transition from cristobalite to quartz or tridymite is &quot;reconstructive&quot;, requiring the breaking up and reforming of the silica framework. These frameworks are composed of SiO4 tetrahedra in which every oxygen atom is shared with a neighbouring tetrahedron, so that the chemical formula of silica is SiO2. The breaking of these bonds, required to convert cristobalite to tridymite and quartz, requires considerable activation energy and may not happen on a human time frame at room temperature. Framework silicates are also known as tectosilicates.

When devitrifying silica, cristobalite is usually the first phase to form, even when well outside its thermodynamic stability range. This is an example of Ostwald&#x27;s step rule. The dynamically disordered nature of the β phase is partly responsible for the low enthalpy of fusion of silica.

=== Structures ===
There is more than one form of the cristobalite framework. At high temperatures, the structure is called β-cristobalite. It is in the cubic crystal system, space group Fdm (No. 227, Pearson symbol &quot;cF104&quot;). It has the diamond structure but with linked tetrahedra of silicon and oxygen where the carbon atoms are in diamond. A chiral tetragonal form called α-cristobalite (space group either P41212, No. 92, or P43212, No. 96, at random) occurs on cooling below about 250 °C at ambient pressure and is related to the cubic form by static tilting of the silica tetrahedra in the framework. This transition is variously called the low-high or formula_1 transition. It may be termed &quot;displacive&quot;; i.e., it is not generally possible to prevent the cubic β form from becoming tetragonal by rapid cooling. Under rare circumstances the cubic form may be preserved if the crystal grain is pinned in a matrix that does not allow for the considerable spontaneous strain that is involved in the transition, which causes a change in shape of the crystal. This transition is highly discontinuous. Going from the α form to the β form causes an increase in volume of 3 or 4 percent. The exact transition temperature depends on the crystallinity of the cristobalite sample, which itself depends on factors such as how long it has been annealed at a particular temperature.

The cubic β phase consists of dynamically disordered silica tetrahedra. The tetrahedra remain fairly regular and are displaced from their ideal static orientations due to the action of a class of low-frequency phonons called rigid unit modes. It is the &quot;freezing&quot; of one of these rigid unit modes that is the soft mode for the α–β transition.

In β-cristobalite, there are right-handed and left-handed helices of tetrahedra (or of silicon atoms) parallel to all three axes. In the α–β phase transition, however, only the right-handed or the left-handed helix in one direction is preserved (the other becoming a two-fold screw axis), so only one of the three degenerate cubic crystallographic axes retains a fourfold rotational axis (actually a screw axis) in the tetragonal form. (That axis becomes the &quot;c&quot; axis, and the new &quot;a&quot; axes are rotated 45° compared to the other two old axes. The new &quot;a&quot; lattice parameter is shorter by approximately the square root of 2, so the α unit cell contains only 4 silicon atoms rather than 8.) The choice of axis is arbitrary, so that various twins can form within the same grain. These different twin orientations coupled with the discontinuous nature of the transition (volume and slight shape change) can cause considerable mechanical damage to materials in which cristobalite is present and that pass repeatedly through the transition temperature, such as refractory bricks.

== Occurrence ==
Cristobalite occurs as white octahedra or spherulites in acidic volcanic rocks and in converted diatomaceous deposits in the Monterey Formation of the US state of California and similar areas.

The micrometre-scale spheres that make up precious opal exhibit some X-ray diffraction patterns that are similar to that of cristobalite, but lack any long-range order so they are not considered true cristobalite. In addition, the presence of structural water in opal makes it doubtful that opal consists of cristobalite.

Cristobalite is visible as the white inclusions in &quot;snowflake obsidian&quot;, a volcanic glass.

<doc id="550451" wikidata="Q339834" url="?curid=550451" title="Regional power">
<text>In international relations, regional power, since the late 20thcentury, has been used for a sovereign state that exercises significant power within its geographical region. States that wield unrivaled power and influence within a region of the world possess regional hegemony.

== Characteristics ==
Regional powers shape the polarity of a regional area. Typically, regional powers have capabilities which are important in the region, but do not have capabilities at a global scale. Slightly contrasting definitions differ as to what makes a regional power. The European Consortium for Political Research defines a regional power as &#x27;a state belonging to a geographically defined region, dominating this region in economic and military terms, able to exercise hegemonic influence in the region and considerable influence on the world scale, willing to make use of power resources and recognized or even accepted as the regional leader by its neighbors.&#x27;

The German Institute of Global and Area Studies states that a regional power must:

== Regional powers ==
In this list are states that have been described as regional powers by international relations and political science academics, analysts, or other experts. These states, to some extent, meet the criteria for regional power status, as described above. Different experts have differing views on exactly which states are regional powers. States are arranged by their region, and in alphabetical order.

=== Africa ===
Even though the economic weight of Africa is relatively low compared to other continents, and more than two-thirds of African countries are among the least developed states in the world, Africa&#x27;s rich natural resources and diverse cultures could carry the potential to enable future development.

Although South Africa was diplomatically isolated during the latter years of the apartheid era, it is considered to have successfully reintegrated into international affairs over the last 20 years. It is recognized as the only newly industrialized country in Africa and takes a crucial role in BRICS and G20. 

Nigeria is often referred to as the &quot;Giant of Africa&quot; due to both its population and economy being the largest in Africa and the cultural influence that it holds over other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa through its movie industry and mass media. Nigeria is also the largest oil producer in Africa.

Nigeria and South Africa are among the largest African economies; both have GDPs over $250 billion (nominal) and $700 billion (PPP) as of 2020.

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====


=== Asia ===
Historically, Imperial China was the dominant power in East Asia. From the late 19th century, the Empire of Japan initiated far-reaching Westernizing reforms, and rapidly industrialized, to become a major power in Asia by the time of World War I, as one of the Allied powers. With economic turmoil, Japan&#x27;s expulsion from the League of Nations, and its interest in expansion on the mainland, Japan became one of the three main Axis powers in World War II.

Since the late 20th century, regional alliances, economic progress, and contrasting military power changed the strategic and regional power balance in Asia. In recent years, a re-balancing of military and economic power among emerging powers, such as China and India, has resulted in significant changes in the geopolitics of Asia. China and Japan have also gained greater influence over regions beyond Asia. In recent decades, South Korea has emerged as a significant economic and cultural power in East Asia. Japan and South Korea are important allies for the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.

=== Europe ===
Russia – the dominant part of a former superpower, the Soviet Union, is now considered a potential superpower, and has historically been the primary geopolitical force in Eastern Europe. France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, collectively known as Big Four in Western Europe, as they play pivotal roles as part of the NATO Quint in the security of the Western Bloc. Most of the continent is now integrated as a consequence of the enlargement of the European Union, which is sometimes considered a great power as a whole, despite it not being a sovereign state. Historically, dominant powers in Europe created colonial empires (such as the Belgian, British, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish Empires).

=== North America ===
The United States is the primary geopolitical force in North America, and is widely considered as the sole contemporary superpower globally. It dominates the region so heavily that its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, both middle powers in the region, are generally not considered regional powers. Despite having a large enough economy to be a member of the G7, Canada is not a regional power for two reasons. It is militarily secure as a result of U.S. hegemony, and has become financially comfortable by its dependence on, and deep integration with, a robust U.S. economy. Mexico is an emerging power which could probably be viewed as a regional power if grouped with Latin America, or a definite regional power if considered in either Middle America or in Hispanic America due to its economic size and diverse cultural heritages. However, similar to Canada, Mexican economy is highly reliant on the U.S. with about 80% of its exports shipping to the U.S. alone.

=== Oceania ===
Australia is considered to be a regional power due to its significant commercial and diplomatic relations in Asia–Pacific region since the late 1990s.

=== South America ===
Since the Age of Discovery, Portugal and Spain mostly divided South America to be the foremost colonial powers in the continent, but following decolonization in the first half of the 19th century, the European powers withdrew and new nations were established, although their cultural influence and languages still remain predominant in Latin America.

Brazil is considered one of the most compelling geopolitical power in South America, as the country has the highest population and landmass in the continent, and its economic size, which possesses large stockpiles of natural resources, including valuable minerals, a tenth of the world&#x27;s fresh water and it&#x27;s also one of the countries that contain the Earth&#x27;s largest remaining rainforest. Brazil has an important role in international relations, especially in economic and global environmental issues.

<text>Charles F. Brehm (January 14, 1925 – August 11, 1996) was a very close witness to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.

==Early life==
Brehm was a World War II veteran who served in the United States Army Rangers who fought and was wounded at the Omaha beach invasion at Pointe du Hoc, France, during D-Day. He later also served during the Korean War.

==Watched presidential motorcade with his son==
Charles F. Brehm and his 5-year-old son, Joe, were standing in the Dealey Plaza north infield grass, a few feet south of the south curb of Elm Street. They were across the street from Abraham Zapruder and the Dealey Plaza grassy knoll. Both Brehm and Joe can be clearly seen in the Zapruder film.

When the presidential limousine turned from Main Street onto Houston Street, Brehm and his son watched from the northwest side of the intersection. After watching the turn, Brehm and his son quickly ran northwestward across the &quot;north infield grass&quot; towards the south curb of Elm Street. They hoped to catch another glimpse of the President. They were standing close to the south curb, directly across the street from Bill and Gayle Newman and their two boys. The location was about 20 feet northeast from close assassination witnesses Jean Hill, and Mary Moorman, as the limousine rounded the 120-degree slow turn from Houston Street onto Elm Street. The movie-filming &quot;babushka lady&quot; was standing nearby to Brehm&#x27;s right backside.

==Description of shots which wounded and killed JFK==

Brehm said President Kennedy was approaching him, and was only away, when his son began to wave to President Kennedy. President Kennedy started to wave back, then Brehm heard the first shot he remembered hearing. Kennedy did not start waving until Zapruder film frame Z-171, which was after live oak tree branches and foliage had already temporarily hidden the President from Z-162 to Z-208 from being seen by anyone in the Texas School Book Depository&#x27;s sixth-floor window.

Brehm stated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that &quot;he could see the President&#x27;s face very well, the President was seated, but was leaning forward when he stiffened perceptibly. He seemed to stiffen and come to a pause. The first shot Brehm remembered hearing was also the first shot that impacted the President. The President reacted immediately to the impact.&quot;

When the President was away, just past Brehm&#x27;s location, Brehm remembered hearing a second shot that struck President Kennedy in the head. Brehm watched the President&#x27;s &quot;hair fly up, ripple, and bits of brain and bone went flying, and then roll over to his side.&quot; President Kennedy &quot;slumped all the way down&quot;.

On the third anniversary of the assassination, Brehm stated that he was &quot;more than satisfied&quot; with the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings. Although he was not called to provide testimony to the commission, Brehm stated: &quot;I see no reason why I should be called. I did not see the man who shot him. I did not see the shots fired. I don&#x27;t feel that anything I would have said would have had any bearing on their outcome.&quot; He described books then-recently published by Warren Commission critics as &quot;nothing but cheap sensationalism&quot;.

==Contributions to assassination documentaries==

In the 1966 video documentary &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; while speaking of the blood cloud and the bits of brain and bone matter that Brehm saw flying in the air when the President&#x27;s head exploded, Brehm stated he was specifically attracted to watch a piece fly towards himself, &quot;over in the area of the curb where I was standing.&quot; ... &quot;It seemed to have come left, and back.&quot; ... &quot;Sir, whatever it was that I saw did fall, both, in that direction, and, over into the curb there.&quot;

Charles Brehm was located behind, and to the President&#x27;s left when the President&#x27;s head first exploded.

On November 22, 1963, only minutes after the assassination, and while he was still standing within Dealey Plaza, Brehm was quoted by a newspaper reporter as saying, &quot;He was waving, then the first shot hit him and that awful look crossed his face,&quot; and that Brehm &quot;seemed to think the shots came from in front of, or, beside the President.&quot;

In his November 24, 1963, FBI statement, and, during the 1987 Showtime cable-TV mock trial, &quot;The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;, Brehm testified that the shots came from either the Texas School Book Depository or the Dal-Tex building.

In a 1967 interview with &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot;, Mark Lane said &quot;[Brehm] told me in a filmed interview that a portion of the President&#x27;s skull was driven back and sharply to the left, over the rear of the President&#x27;s car. Unless the laws of physics were temporarily suspended, this offers impressive corroboration for those who say the shot came from the right front of the car—in substantially the opposite direction from the Depository.&quot;

Like many other supporting witnesses, Brehm stated that he distinctly remembered hearing another separate shot after the shot which wounded the President&#x27;s head. The latter shot missed hitting anyone and was the reason that Brehm quickly dragged his son to the ground, covering him protectively.

In 1988 Brehm told author Larry Sneed, &quot;After the car passed the building coming toward us, I heard a... surprising noise, and (the President) reached with both hands up to the side of his throat and kind of stiffened out... And when he got down in the area just past me, the second shot hit which damaged, considerably damaged, the top of his head... That car took off in an evasive motion... and was just beyond me when a third shot went off. The third shot really frightened me! It had a completely different sound to it because it had really passed me as anybody knows who has been in down under targets in the Army or been shot at like I had been many times. You know when a bullet passes over you, the cracking sound it makes, and that bullet had an absolute crack to it. I do believe that that (third) shot was wild. It didn&#x27;t hit anybody. I don&#x27;t think it could have hit anybody. But it was a frightening thing to me because here was one shot that hit him, obviously; here was another shot that destroyed his head, and what was the reason for that third shot? That third shot frightened me more than the other two, and I grabbed the boy and threw him on the ground because I didn&#x27;t know if we were going to have a &#x27;shoot-&#x27;em-up&#x27; in this area.&quot;

<text>In human–computer interaction, WIMP stands for &quot;windows, icons, menus, pointer&quot;, denoting a style of interaction using these elements of the user interface. Other expansions are sometimes used, such as substituting &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;mice&quot; for menus, or &quot;pull-down menu&quot; and &quot;pointing&quot; for pointer.

Though the acronym has fallen into disuse, it has often been likened to the term &quot;graphical user interface (GUI)&quot;. Any interface that uses graphics can be called a GUI, and WIMP systems derive from such systems. However, while all WIMP systems use graphics as a key element (the icon and pointer elements), and therefore are GUIs, the reverse is not true. Some GUIs are not based in windows, icons, menus, and pointers. For example, most mobile phones represent actions as icons and menus, but often do not rely on a conventional pointer or containerized windows to host program interactions. 

WIMP interaction was developed at Xerox PARC (see Xerox Alto, developed in 1973) and popularized with Apple&#x27;s introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, which added the concepts of the &quot;menu bar&quot; and extended window management.

The WIMP interface has the following components:

* A window runs a self-contained program, isolated from other programs that (if in a multi-program operating system) run at the same time in other windows.
**These individual program containers enable users to move fluidly between different windows.
**The window manager software is typically designed such that it is clear which window is currently active. Design principles of spacing, grouping, and simplicity help the user maintain focus when working between more than one window.
* An icon acts as a shortcut to an action the computer performs (e.g., execute a program or task).
**Text labels can be used alongside icons to help identification for small icon sets.
* A menu is a text or icon-based selection system that selects and executes programs or tasks. Menus may change depending on context in which they are accessed.
* The pointer is an onscreen symbol that represents movement of a physical device that the user controls to select icons, data elements, etc.

This style of system improves human–computer interaction (&quot;HCI&quot;) by emulating real-world interactions and providing greater ease of use for non-technical people. Because programs contained by a WIMP interface subsequently rely on the same core input methods, the interactions throughout the system are standardized. This consistency allows users&#x27; skills to carry from one application to another.

==Criticism==
Some human–computer interaction researchers consider WIMP to be ill-suited for multiple applications, especially those requiring precise human input or more than three dimensions of input. Drawing and writing are example of these limitations; a traditional pointer is limited by two dimensions, and consequently doesn&#x27;t account for the pressure applied when using a physical writing utility. Pressure-sensitive graphics tablets are often used to overcome this limitation.

Another issue with WIMP-style user interfaces is that many implementations put users with disabilities at a disadvantage. For example, visually impaired users may have difficulty using applications when alternative text-based interfaces are not made available. People with motor impairments, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, may not be able to navigate devices precisely using the traditional mouse pointer for input. To overcome these barriers, researchers continue to explore ways to make modern computer systems more accessible. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, have opened new doors for accessibility in technology, or assistive technology.

== Moving past the WIMP interface ==
Multiple studies have explored the possibilities of moving past the WIMP interface, such as using reality-based interaction, making the interface &quot;three-dimensional&quot; by adding visual depth through the use of monocular cues, and even combining depth with physics. The latter resulted in the development of BumpTop desktop and its acquisition and release by Google.

<text>Ghardaïa () is an Algerian province located in the north of the Algerian desert. Its administrative center is the city of Ghardaia, located south of the capital Algiers. Its total area is estimated at , from north to south, and from east to west. It rises above sea level.

==Geographical location==
The province is bordered by the province of Djelfa and the province of Laghouat to the north, the province of El Menia in the south, the province of Ouargla to the east and the province of El Bayadh in the west.

The city of Ghardaia, the capital of the province, is from Laghouat, 200 km from Ouargla, from El Menia and from El Bayadh, and is crossed by the national road 1 linking the Algerian capital to the Great South.

==Climate==
Since the state is located in desert areas, the climate of the region is arid desert, the temperature range is wide between day and night, and between winter and summer; the winter temperature ranges between , and between in summer. The weather is fair in spring and autumn, and the sky is clear most days of the year.

The average rainfall in the state is about annually, mostly in the winter season. How much cold northwesterly winds blow in the winter and south-westerly winds laden with sand in the spring and in the summer a hot south known as Sirocco.

==History==

c.1100 - Town of Ghardaïa is founded by the Mozabites, Amazigh Muslims of the Ibadi sect.

1984 - The Ghardaïa province was carved out of Laghouat Province.

2015 - Violence causing the death of over 20 citizens as a result of ethnic tension between &quot;Bani Mzab and Arab Bedouin from various branches of the Chaamba tribe&quot;.

&quot;Aghlan&quot; is the name the Beni Mzab have given to their region. Its geographical borders are as follows: Oued Bouzbyar in the North, Oued Zergoun in the west. The Mzab includes Zelfana and Guerrara in the east and is merged to the region of Chaamba in the south. The area is approximately .

During the 8th century AD, 2nd century Hegira (according to Cheikh Abi Ishak Tfyeche) thé Beni Mzab settled on the banks of the oued or Valley to which they gave their name. The first inhabitants of the area had been nomadic or semi-nomadic. Many old small built-up areas, fallen into ruins long time ago, can be counted: in nearby al Atteuf we mention Agharm Netlazdit, Oukheira, and Aoulaoual, Tmazzert once existed near Bounoura and Agharm Enwadday has preceded the present city of Melika.
Not far from Tafilalt were the towns of Mourki. Tirichine, Tlet Moussa, Agnounay and Boukyaou.

The final settling process of Beni Mzab along with the emergency of the three following cities: El Atteuf, which was settled in 1012; Bounoura in 1065, Ghardaia settled in 1085; and more than two centuries later, in 1321, Tafilalt expanded and integrated the inhabitants of its neighboring villages and is named since then Beni Isgeun. In 1355, Melika succeed Agharm Enwadday. This way the Mzab pentapolis was born.

Three centuries later, in 1631, the town of Guerrara was founded northeast of the pentapolis and 60 years later the town of Berriane was founded north of the pentapolis.

Now and since the last administrative division (in 1984) the seven Mzabite towns have been reduced into five municipalities in the province of Ghardaia.

==Administrative divisions==
The province is made up of 7 districts, which are divided into 9 &quot;communes&quot; or municipalities.
===Districts===
# Métlili
# Bounoura
# Ghardaïa
# Dhayet Bendhahoua
# Zelfana

# At bounour 
# Dhayet Bendhahoua 
# Tajnint
# Igrarene 
# Taghrdait
# Metlili
# Sebseb
# Zelfana
# Mansoura

==The governors==
The position of Wali of Ghardaia was held by many national political figures since its establishment on 4 February 1984 under Law No. 84-09 which reorganized the Algerian territories by increasing the number of provinces from 31 to 48.
== Transportation ==

=== Road transport ===
The state of Ghardaia is characterized by the presence of a road transport network, represented by a network of highways, in addition to a huge fleet of large and small buses, yellow taxis, and others.

=== Air transport ===
Ghardaia Airport - Numirat Moufdi Zakaria (IATA: GHA, ICAO: DAUG) is an international airport located in the city of Ghardaia, and the airport was named after the Algerian poet Moufdi Zakaria.

<text>Police Academy is a comedy franchise of seven theatrical films and two spin-off television shows. The 1984 film &quot;Police Academy&quot; followed the premise of a new mayor requiring the local police department to accept all recruits. The film franchise relies heavily on slapstick humor and physical comedy, as the misfit recruits attempt to prove themselves capable of being police officers, succeeding despite their eccentricities. The first four films follow Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), a repeat offender forced to join the police academy as punishment. The 1994 film &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; marked the seventh installment, with cast members George Gaynes, Michael Winslow, and David Graf appearing throughout the film series.

The first film grossed $149.8 million worldwide. While the subsequent films failed to impress critics, they sustained commercial success, grossing $391 million in total. Parallels have been drawn between &quot;Police Academy&quot; and the British &quot;Carry On&quot; series, for their common tropes of a returning ensemble cast, frequent use of lowbrow humor, and reliance on sexual innuendo. 

Guttenberg announced in September 2018 that a new &quot;Police Academy&quot; movie was in the works after spending years in development hell.

==Films==
===&quot;Police Academy&quot; (1984)===

&quot;Police Academy&quot; was released in 1984 and directed by Hugh Wilson. The film has a newly elected female mayor announcing a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. The movie followed a group of misfit recruits in their attempts to prove themselves capable of being police officers and their adventures at the police academy.

===&quot;Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment&quot; (1985)===

In &quot;Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment&quot;, the newly graduated cadets are sent to one of the worst precincts in the city to improve the conditions. Lt. Mauser undermines their attempts so he can get Capt. Lassard fired and get the position in charge.

===&quot;Police Academy 3: Back in Training&quot; (1986)===

&quot;Police Academy 3: Back in Training&quot; was released in 1986, and like its predecessor, was directed by Jerry Paris. When the governor of the state announces that budget cuts necessitate the closure of the worst of the two police academies, the officers of the Metropolitan Police Academy, led by Commandant Lassard, work on ensuring it is not theirs. This is hindered by their unusual gang of new cadets.

===&quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot; (1987)===

&quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot;, released in 1987 and directed by Jim Drake, involves new recruits being brought in when the officers work with a newly formed Citizens on Patrol group. Harris and Proctor are in charge, though, and plan to dismantle the program. &quot;Citizens on Patrol&quot; was the final film starring Guttenberg.

===&quot;Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach&quot; (1988)===

&quot;Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach&quot;, released in 1988, was directed by Alan Myerson. The plot involves the officers attending a police convention in Florida to honor Commandant Eric Lassard as police officer of the decade, wherein he inadvertently switches his sports bag with that of a group of jewel thieves. The thieves try to get it back.

===&quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot; (1989)===

The sixth installment, &quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot;, directed by Peter Bonerz, was released in 1989. When the city suffers from a dangerous set of crimes by a gang of jewel thieves, the Metropolitan Police Academy graduates are brought in to do something about it.

===&quot;Police Academy: Mission to Moscow&quot; (1994)===

&quot;Police Academy: Mission to Moscow&quot;, released in 1994 and directed by Alan Metter, involved the officers going to Russia to help catch an international crime figure.

===Future===
A franchise reboot has been in various stages of development hell since 2003, when the eighth &quot;Police Academy&quot; film was announced with a tentative release scheduled for 2007. The studio acknowledged the franchise&#x27;s return after more than thirteen years of absence, Paul Maslansky stated, &quot;I felt it was time to start again. I saw that &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and a number of other revivals were doing really well. &quot;Police Academy&quot; has such a great history, so I thought, &#x27;Why not?&#x27;&quot; with most of the main cast members set to return. Hugh Wilson was later slated to direct. Leslie Easterbrook (Capt. Debbie Callahan) and Marion Ramsey (Sgt. Laverne Hooks) mentioned that filming for the next &quot;Police Academy&quot; film was scheduled to commence principal photography mid-2006 to meet its 2007 release. The film was suspended in October 2006, at which point Easterbrook mentioned that the project may be repurposed as a direct-to-DVD sequel. She added that though Warner Bros. wanted to do a new film, they wanted a producer to get independent financing.

In May 2008, Michael Winslow replied to a question about a possible new &quot;Police Academy&quot; film: &quot;Anything&#x27;s possible. You&#x27;ve got to hope for Paul Maslansky and those folks over there to put it together. It&#x27;s up to them. It would be great to see everyone again.&quot; In November of the same year, Steve Guttenberg (Sgt. Carey Mahoney) confirmed that &quot;8&quot; was still in development and that he was working on the script with Warner Bros. Guttenberg is slated to direct the film, and stated that all living cast members from the previous installments would return to reprise their roles.

In March 2010, New Line announced plans to revive the &quot;Police Academy&quot; franchise, with a new film in development with Paul Maslansky attached as filmmaker. Maslansky stated, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be very worthwhile to the people who remember it and to those who saw it on TV ... It&#x27;s going to be a new class. We hope to discover new talent and season it with great comedians. It&#x27;ll be anything but another movie with a numeral next to it. And we&#x27;ll most probably retain the wonderful musical theme.&quot; Later that month, the filmmaker stated that he plans to bring back some of the original cast to train the new recruits. While appearing as a guest on the July 12, 2010, edition of &quot;This Morning&quot;, Michael Winslow (Sgt. Larvell Jones) confirmed that &quot;Police Academy 8&quot; was in active development. In August 2010, Steve Guttenberg revealed a script was being written by David Diamond and David Weissman. In August 2010, actor Bobcat Goldthwait (Officer Zed) released a statement urging Hollywood to reboot the &quot;Police Academy&quot; series with a new group of actors instead of the original cast members. Goldthwait confirmed that Steve Guttenberg would return and that movie bosses were trying to get Kim Cattrall and Sharon Stone to return for an eighth film, though Goldthwait said he had no desire to return to the series.

By January 2012, New Line Cinema announced that Scott Zabielski would replace Maslansky as the director of the upcoming film. Later in March of the same year, Michael Winslow stated that production of the eighth film tentatively scheduled to commence that November, and that an offer had been made to Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to replace the late Bubba Smith as Hightower. In June 2012, Jeremy Garelick was hired to contribute to a rewrite the aforementioned script. After years of delays, Steve Guttenberg announced in September 2018, that the sequel was once again in active development; stating, &quot;the next &quot;Police Academy&quot; is coming, no details yet, but it is in a gift bag being readied!&quot;

==Television==
===&quot;Police Academy: The Animated Series&quot; (1988–1989)===

===&quot;Police Academy: The Series&quot; (1997–1998)===

&quot;Police Academy: The Series&quot; is a 1997 live-action show based on the films, comprising 26 episodes, each one hour. It was produced by Warner Bros. Television and Protocol Entertainment. Michael Winslow reprised his role from the films, and several others made occasional guest appearances.

==Comic books==
A six-issue series of &quot;Police Academy&quot; comic books was produced as a spin-off of the animated series beginning in August 1989. The series was published by Marvel Comics, under a &quot;Star Comics Presents&quot; byline.

<doc id="550480" wikidata="Q28135" url="?curid=550480" title="Hirundo">
<text>The bird genus Hirundo is a group of passerines in the family Hirundinidae (swallows and martins). The genus name is Latin for a swallow. These are the typical swallows, including the widespread barn swallow. Many of this group have blue backs, red on the face and sometimes the rump or nape, and whitish or rufous underparts. With fifteen species this genus is the largest in its family.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is the Latin word for a swallow. Linnaeus included eight species in the genus and of these William Swainson designated the barn swallow (&quot;Hirundo rustica&quot;) as the type species.

===Extant species===
The genus contains sixteen species. The linear sequence is based on two molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2005 and 2018.

===Extinct species===
There are at least two fossil species included in this genus:
*†&quot;Hirundo gracilis&quot; (late Miocene of Polgardi, Hungary)
*†&quot;Hirundo major&quot; (Pliocene of Csarnota, Hungary)

===Former species===
Some authorities, either presently or formerly, recognize several additional species as belonging to the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; including:
* West African swallow (as &quot;Hirundo domicella&quot;)

==Distribution and habitat==
All of the species are found in the Old World, although one, the barn swallow, is cosmopolitan, also occurring in the Americas.

<text>David Lambert Lack FRS (16 July 1910 – 12 March 1973) was a British evolutionary biologist who made contributions to ornithology, ecology, and ethology. His 1947 book, &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Finches&quot;, on the finches of the Galapagos Islands was a landmark work as were his other popular science books on &quot;Life of the Robin&quot; and &quot;Swifts in a Tower&quot;. He developed what is now known as Lack&#x27;s Principle which explained the evolution of avian clutch sizes in terms of individual selection as opposed to the competing contemporary idea that they had evolved for the benefit of species (also known as group selection). His pioneering life-history studies of the living bird helped in changing the nature of ornithology from what was then a collection-oriented field. He was a longtime director of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at the University of Oxford.

==Education and early life==
Lack was born in London, the oldest of four children of Harry Lambert Lack MD FRCS, who later became President of the British Medical Association. The name &#x27;Lack&#x27; is derived from &#x27;Lock&#x27;. His father grew up in a farming family from Norfolk and became a leading ear, nose and throat surgeon at the London Hospital. Although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced David&#x27;s interest. His mother Kathleen was the daughter of Lt. Col. McNeil Rind of the Indian army. Kathleen&#x27;s father was Scottish and on her mother&#x27;s side was part Irish, Greek and Georgian. Kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage. At home they organized meetings of the poetry society. David was schooled at home until seven and then went to the Open Air School in Regent&#x27;s Park before going to The Hall, Hampstead followed by Foster&#x27;s School, Stubbington and Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt, Norfolk. Lack was taught biology at Gresham&#x27;s by W.H. Foy and G.H. Lockett. He went to Magdalene College, Cambridge and received a BA second class in 1933 after studying botany, zoology and geology for part I of the Tripos and zoology for part II.

Until the age of fifteen, Lack lived in a large house in Devonshire Place, London. The family spent their summers in New Romney Kent where Lack became familiar with the local birds especially on Romney Marsh. By the age of nine, he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an alphabetically arranged life-list. In 1926, Lack won the Holland-Martin Natural History Prize for an essay on &quot;Three Birds of Kelling Heath&quot;. In 1928, with an essay on &#x27;My favourite birds&#x27; he was the national winner of the senior prize (a silver medal) in the Public School Essay Competition, organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. David did not wish to follow his father&#x27;s profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology. His father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for David at the Frankfurt museum in the summer of 1929. He spent four months pinning insects in the Senckenberg Museum and found it “extremely” boring. He joined the Cambridge Ornithological Club whose members included Peter Scott, Arthur Duncan, Dominic Serventy, and Tom Harrisson. His first scientific paper was on the display of nightjars, published in the Ibis in 1932. He joined on several expeditions with Cambridge researchers including two to the Arctic. Lack wrote &quot;The Birds of Cambridgeshire&quot; (1934) which was published by the Cambridge Bird Club. In this work, he departed from the contemporary style with a distinct de-emphasis on rare and accidental birds.

Lack received an Sc.D. from Cambridge University in 1948.

==Career and research==
After Cambridge, Lack, on the recommendation of Julian Huxley took up a position as a science mentor at Dartington Hall School, Devonshire from 1934 until Summer 1938 when he took a year off to study bird behaviour on the Galapagos Islands. In 1935 he made his first trip to the United States as a chaperone for a Dartington Hall student returning to California. Here he met Joseph Grinnell and Robert McCabe and gave a talk at the Cooper Ornithological Club. In New York, he met Ernst Mayr at the American Museum of Natural History. He returned via the &quot;SS Bremen&quot;, only one of about four English speakers on the German ship. He was only in the Galapagos for part of that year, starting August 1938. With the data that he collected in the Galapagos, especially on the finches he went to the United States. April to August 1939 was spent at the California Academy of Sciences which held a large collection of the finches of Galapagos that had been studied earlier by Harry Swarth and at Ernst Mayr&#x27;s home in New Jersey. While in the US he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with John T. Emlen. He returned home in September 1939, after the outbreak of war. Lack published &quot;The Galapagos Finches (Geospizinae), A Study in Variation&quot; in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift. Lack&#x27;s first major work was &quot;The Life of the Robin&quot;, which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at Dartington Hall School. He examined robin behaviour, song, territory, pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds. The manuscript was completed in 1942 and it went through five editions from 1943 to 1970. One of Lack&#x27;s students at Dartington Hall was Eva Ibbotson. A colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for Lack was the geography teacher Bill Hunter. In 1934 Lack went to Tanganyika on an invitation from R.E. Moreau.
Lack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his Dartington days with the founder of the college, Leonard Knight Elmhirst. During World War II Lack however served with a British Army unit called the Army Operational Research Group on the Orkney Islands working on radar use. During this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including George Varley, an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations. Lack&#x27;s observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of radar ornithology to study bird migration. Lack was released from wartime duty in August 1945 so as to take a position to as Director (succeeding W.B. Alexander) of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at Oxford University, a position that he held until his death in 1973.

Lack&#x27;s work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the &quot;living bird&quot;. He was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in Britain, especially those based on quantitative approaches, when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution. Lack&#x27;s major scientific research included work on population biology and density dependent regulation. His work suggested that natural selection favoured clutch sizes that ensured the greatest number of surviving young. This interpretation was however debated by V.C. Wynne-Edwards who suggested that clutch size was density-independent. This was one of the earliest debates on group selection. Lack&#x27;s studies were based on nidicolous birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds.

As a mentor for numerous doctoral students, Lack followed a hands-off method, letting students decide their own research topics. He encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the &quot;simplest explanation, which was probably best.&quot; He would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.

He wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals, and had a knack of choosing memorable titles: he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title &quot;Territory and Polygamy in a Bishop&quot;. This 1935 publication was subsequently titled &quot;Territory and polygamy in a bishop bird, &quot;Euplectes hordeacea hordeacea&quot; (Linn.)&quot; in the journal &quot;Ibis&quot; as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding.

=== Darwin&#x27;s finches ===
Lack&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Finches,&quot; a landmark study whose title linked Darwin&#x27;s name with the Galapagos group of species and popularised the term &quot;Darwin&#x27;s finches&quot; in 1947, though the term had been introduced by Percy Lowe in 1936. There are two versions of this work, differing significantly in their conclusions. The first is a book-length monograph, written after his visit to the Galapagos, but not published until 1945. In it Lack interprets the differences in bill size as species recognition signals, that is, as isolating mechanisms.

The second is the later book in which the differences in bill size are interpreted as adaptations to specific food niches, an interpretation that has since been abundantly confirmed. This change of mind, according to Lack&#x27;s Preface, came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work. The effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism. In this way his work contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis, in which natural selection came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution, and not random or mutational events. Lack&#x27;s work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues. Lack&#x27;s work feeds into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the Galapagos fauna on a more varied canvas. According to Ernst Mayr,

:&quot;The person who more than anyone else deserves credit for reviving an interest in the ecological significance of species was David Lack... It is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit co-existence with potential competitors.&quot;

===Lack&#x27;s Principle===
In 1943 Lack took an interest in clutch size after reading Moreau&#x27;s manuscript sent to the &quot;Ibis&quot;. Lack was then an assistant to the editor of the &quot;Ibis&quot;. Lack postulated what is now known as Lack&#x27;s Principle, which states that &quot;the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food&quot;.
=== Population regulation ===
Lack took a keen interest in the mechanisms involved in regulating populations in nature. &quot;The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers&quot; is one of Lack&#x27;s most frequently cited works. Here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained. It was critiqued by J.B.S. Haldane who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies. The other major critic was V.C. Wynne-Edwards with whom he clashed for nearly a decade. Lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including Population Studies of Birds (1966).

The centenary of Lack&#x27;s birth, 16 July 2010, was marked by a &#x27;David Lack Centenary Symposium&#x27;, hosted by the Edward Grey Institute. A programme of talks focused on and celebrated the scientific contributions of Lack to ornithology, and the broader fields of ecology and evolution, and assessed the development of these fields in the 21st century.

==Personal life==
David Lack married Elizabeth Lack (née Silva) who was also an ornithologist. Elizabeth Silva was born in Hertfordshire in 1916 and took an early interest in music. She wished to join the Royal Academy of Music in London but the war led to her serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as an ambulance driver in Europe. After the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to Richard Fitter who passed it on to David Lack with a note &quot;Here&#x27;s another for your reject file.&quot; Lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary. Noting her interest in birds, he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the Wytham Woods. She also helped in the study of swifts. One day Elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and David, worried that she might have fallen off a ladder, found her engrossed in observation. They became engaged in 1948 and were married on July 9, 1949. The best man was George Varley. They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), Andrew Lack (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain). In Oxford, the Lacks initially lived in a flat in Park Town, Oxford, and later on Boars Hill, just south of Oxford. Lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated. Lack died from Non-Hodgkin lymphoma despite radiation treatments.

===Religious beliefs===
Lack&#x27;s parents belonged to the Church of England, and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to Anglicanism in 1948, possibly influenced by Dan and Mary Neylan, friends at Dartington Hall. He sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote, in 1957, &quot;Evolutionary theory and Christian belief,&quot; on the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory. Lack believed that evolution could not account for morality, truth, beauty, free will, self-awareness and individual responsibility. This book foreshadows, in some ways, the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between religion and science later popularised by Stephen Jay Gould.

Arthur Cain remarked of him, &quot;David Lack was the only religious man I knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection.&quot;

<text>The Electronic Product Code (EPC) is designed as a universal identifier (using an idiosyncratic numerical code for each different commodity) that provides a unique identity for every physical object anywhere in the world, for all time. The EPC structure is defined in the EPCglobal Tag Data Standard, which is a freely available standard. The canonical representation of an EPC is a URI, namely the &#x27;pure-identity URI&#x27; representation that is intended for use when referring to a specific physical object in communications about EPCs among information systems and business application software.

The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard also defines additional representations of an EPC identifier, such as the tag-encoding URI format and a compact binary format suitable for storing an EPC identifier efficiently within RFID tags (for which the low-cost passive RFID tags typically have limited memory capacity available for the EPC/UII memory bank). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard defines the structure of the URI syntax and binary format, as well as the encoding and decoding rules to allow conversion between these representations. The EPC is designed as a flexible framework that can support many existing coding schemes, including many coding schemes currently in use with barcode technology. EPC identifiers currently support 7 identification keys from the GS1 system of identifiers, as well as a General Identifier and EPC identifiers that can be used for encoding supplies to the US Department of Defense.

EPCs are not designed exclusively for use with RFID data carriers. They can indeed be constructed based on reading of optical data carriers, such as linear bar codes and two-dimensional bar codes, such as Data Matrix symbols. The &#x27;pure identity URI&#x27; canonical representation of an EPC is agnostic to the data carrier technology that was used to attach the unique identifier to the individual physical object.

The EPC is designed to meet the needs of various industries, while guaranteeing uniqueness for all EPC-compliant tags. Some of the existing GS1 identification keys (such as the Global Returnable Asset Identifier (&quot;GRAI&quot;)) already provide for unique identification of individual objects. However, the Global Trade Item Number (&quot;GTIN&quot;) only identifies the product type or stock-keeping unit rather than an individual instance of a particular product type. To ensure that an EPC always uniquely identifies an individual physical object, in the case of a GTIN, the EPC is constructed as a &quot;Serialised Global Trade Item Number&quot; (&quot;SGTIN&quot;) by combining a GTIN product identifier with a unique serial number.

Both the Universal Product Code and EAN-13 identifiers that are still found on many trade items can be mapped into a 14-digit GTIN identifier, by padding to the left with zero digits to reach a total of 14 digits. An SGTIN EPC identifier can therefore be constructed by combining the resulting GTIN with a unique serial number and following the encoding rules in the EPCglobal Tag Data Standard.

The EPC accommodates existing coding schemes and defines new schemes where necessary. Each coding scheme within the EPC identifier framework is distinguished through the use of a separate namespace. In the URI notations, this is indicated using a URI prefix such as codice_1 or codice_2
In the compact binary encoding of an EPC identifier, the namespace is instead indicated using a compact binary header (typically the first 8 bits of the binary encoding of an EPC identifier). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard provides details of the URI prefixes and corresponding binary header values.

Low-cost passive RFID tags were designed to uniquely identify each item manufactured. In contrast, bar codes for trade items and consumer products have limited capacity and typically only identify the manufacturer and class of products. Although RFID tags are currently still more expensive than a simple optically readable label, they offer additional capabilities such as the ability to be read by radio waves, without requiring &#x27;line of sight&#x27; between the reader or interrogator and the tag; this enables individual items within a large cardboard box (case) to be read without first unpacking each individual item from the box. Some RFID tags offer additional read/write user memory that could be used for storage of additional information, such as an expiry date or date of manufacture.

Plain text and barcoding are still useful in addition to the EPC tag, as liability obligations for the producer require durable and sufficiently fail-safe labels. Currently (2010) there are no applications in which RFID tags have completely replaced conventional labeling.

The EPC was the creation of the MIT Auto-ID Center, a consortium of over 120 global corporations and university labs. EPC identifiers were designed to identify each item manufactured, as opposed to just the manufacturer and class of products, as bar codes do today. The EPC system is currently managed by EPCglobal, Inc., a subsidiary of GS1. The specifications for the EPC identifiers can be found in the EPCglobal, Inc. Tag Data Standard, which is an open standard, freely available for anyone to download.

The Electronic Product Code is one of the industrial standards for global RFID usage, and a core element of the EPCglobal Network, an architecture of open standards developed by the GS1 EPCglobal community. Most currently deployed EPC RFID tags comply with ISO/IEC 18000-6C for the RFID air interface standard.

== Structure ==

The canonical representation of an EPC is a URI - the &#x27;pure-identity URI&#x27; that is intended for use when referring to a specific physical object in communications about EPCs among information systems and business application software.

Each coding scheme within the EPC identifier framework is distinguished through the use of a separate namespace. In the URI notations, this is indicated using a URI prefix such as codice_1 or codice_2
In the compact binary encoding of an EPC identifier, the namespace is instead indicated using a compact binary header (typically the first 8 bits of the binary encoding of an EPC identifier). The EPCglobal Tag Data Standard provides details of the URI prefixes and corresponding binary header values.

This namespace indicator (URI prefix or compact binary header value) in turn dictates the length, type and structure of the EPC. EPC encoding schemes are used to uniquely identify one object. Most EPCs include an element within their structure that corresponds to a serial number.

EPC Version 1.3 supports the following alternative coding schemes:
* General Identifier (GID) GID-96
* a serialized version of the GS1 Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) SGTIN-96 SGTIN-198
* GS1 Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) SSCC-96
* GS1 Global Location Number (GLN), SGLN-96 SGLN-195
* GS1 Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) GRAI-96 GRAI-170
* GS1 Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) GIAI-96 GIAI-202 and
* DOD Construct DoD-96

From Version 1.4 these new coding schemas are also additionally supported:
* Global Service Relation Number (GSRN) GSRN-96
* Global Document Type Identifier (GDTI) GDTI-96

==All GS1 Identification Keys==

GS1 identification keys includes detailed information about 12 GS1 ID keys, their purpose, use, allocation and maintenance rules, etc.

GS1 Application Identifiers defines the prefixes (AIs) used in barcodes and EPC/RFID-tags to define the meaning and format of identifiers, and currently lists 516 kinds of identifiers.

The EPC Tag Data Standard (TDS) defines the possible kinds of EPC identifiers, including:
* Correspondence to GS1 keys and other existing codes. 
* Specification of data that is carried on Gen 2 RFID tags, including the EPC, User Memory data, control information, and tag manufacture information. 
* The formatting of the Tag Identifier (TID) memory bank and how to use Packed Objects for the formatting of additional data within the user memory bank.
* A mapping of GS1 identifiers to URNs to be used in EPCIS (see EPCIS 1.2 section 6.4 Identifier representation).

The latest TDS version defines the following GS1 Identification Keys:
* Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), including RCN-8, GTIN-8, GTIN-12, GTIN-13, ISBN, ISMN, ISSN for a class of products, goods or services
* GTIN + Batch/Lot (LGTIN)
* Serialised Global Trade Item Number (SGTIN) for an individual product with a serial number
* Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) for logistics assets
* Global Location Number (GLN) or GLN with extension (SGLN) for parties and locations
* Global Location Number of Party (PGLN)
* Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) for logistics assets
* Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) for fixed assets
* Global Service Relation Number – Recipient (GSRN)
* Global Service Relation Number – Provider (GSRNP)
* Global Document Type Identifier (GDTI) of a document instance
* Component / Part Identifier (CPI) for part numbers in technical industries, including automotive
* Serialised Global Coupon Number (SGCN)
* Global Identification Number for Consignment (GINC)
* Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN) for shipping
* Individual Trade Item Piece (ITIP)
* Unit Pack Identifier (UPUI)
* General Identifier (GID)
* US Department of Defense Identifier (DOD)
* Aerospace and Defense Identifier (ADI)
* BIC Container Code (BIC) for intermodal containers used in rail and shipping, as per ISO 6346
* IMO Vessel Number (IMOVN) of marine vessels

<doc id="550486" wikidata="Q512576" url="?curid=550486" title="MirrorMask">
<text>MirrorMask is a 2005 British-American dark fantasy film designed and directed by Dave McKean, and written by Neil Gaiman from a story they developed together. Produced by The Jim Henson Company, the film stars Stephanie Leonidas, Jason Barry, Rob Brydon, and Gina McKee.

Gaiman and McKean worked on the film concepts over the course of two weeks at Jim Henson&#x27;s family&#x27;s home. Production took seventeen months on a budget of $4 million. Initially intended for the direct-to-video market, &quot;MirrorMask&quot; premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival before receiving a limited theatrical run in the United States on September 30, 2005. Critical reaction was mixed, with praise for the visuals but criticism towards the story and script.

==Plot==
Helena Campbell works alongside her parents Joanne and Morris at their family circus, but desires to join real life. At the next performance, after a heated argument between mother and daughter, Joanne collapses and is taken to the hospital. While Helena stays with her grandmother, she learns that her mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation.

That night, Helena wakes in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find a trio of performers outside. As they perform for her, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third, a juggler named Valentine, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety via magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light, slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon, Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister. He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadows stole a charm from the White City, leaving their Queen of Light in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows, who has mistaken Helena for her daughter.

As they strive to stay ahead of the shadows, Helena and Valentine follow clues to the charm, called the &quot;MirrorMask&quot;. Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her bedroom in the real world, through the drawings of windows that she created and hung on the wall of her room. She discovers that a doppelgänger is living there, behaving radically differently from her. The doppelgänger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Valentine betrays Helena to the Queen of Shadows in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen&#x27;s servants brainwash Helena into believing that she is the Princess of Shadows. Valentine has a change of heart and returns to the Queen&#x27;s palace, helping Helena break the spell. They search the Princess&#x27; room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the mirror. They flee the castle with the charm.

As they escape to Valentine&#x27;s flying tower, Helena realizes that her doppelgänger in the real world is the Princess of Shadows, who had used the MirrorMask to step through the windows in Helena&#x27;s drawings. The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world. The Princess takes the drawings to the roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to reality, sending the Princess back to her realm. Simultaneously, the Queen of Light awakens and the two Cities are restored to their natural balance.

Helena is woken on the roof by her father, and they&#x27;re overjoyed to hear that Joanne&#x27;s operation is a success. Helena happily returns to work at the circus, where she becomes fascinated by a young man—heavily resembling Valentine—who aspires to be a juggler.

==Cast==
* Stephanie Leonidas as Helena Campbell, a young circus performer and aspiring artist who is drawn into a mysterious world of masked people and monsters shortly after her mother is hospitalized. It is eventually revealed that the world she entered was created through her own drawings that she hung up on the walls of her room. Leonidas stated that she expected that filming would be difficult because most of the scenes were done with one or two other actors just with a bluescreen in the background, but also said that &quot;it all came alive&quot; for them when they started working.
** Leonidas also portrays The Princess, Helena&#x27;s parallel self and the Queen of Shadows&#x27; rebellious daughter. She uses the MirrorMask to switch places with Helena and hides it in her room. After escaping to the &quot;real world&quot;, she takes advantage of her new freedom: dressing like a teenage punk, kissing boys, smoking, and arguing with Helena&#x27;s father.
* Jason Barry as Valentine, a juggler who keeps describing himself as a &quot;very important man&quot;. He is Helena&#x27;s companion in the dream world, although he betrays Helena by handing over to the Queen of Shadows. He regrets this decision, however, and returns to rescue Helena. He is very proud of his tower, though he mentions that he had an argument with it and that they parted ways. As he and Helena are being pursued by the Queen of Shadows, he calls the tower to aid their escape by shouting an apology to it. When Helena reawakens in her world, she meets him again auditioning as a juggler for the circus. Barry commented that to play his role he had to learn to juggle.
* Rob Brydon as Morris Campbell, Helena&#x27;s father. A juggler and ringmaster of his family circus, he is a gentle and kind man with an artistic temperament. He is frightened and overwhelmed by his wife&#x27;s illness. Brydon also plays the Queen of Light&#x27;s majordomo.
* Gina McKee as Joanne Campbell, Helena&#x27;s mother. A circus acrobat and ticket-seller, Joanne collapses during a skit and is confined in the hospital shortly after having an argument with Helena. After a successful operation, Joanne recovers and returns to circus life with her family.
** McKee also plays The Queen of Shadows, a possessive mother who treats her daughter like a pet. She mistakes Helena for the Princess who has run away, but when Helena reveals who she is, the Queen does not care as long as she has a daughter.
** McKee also plays The Queen of Light, a kind ruler. She falls into a deep sleep when the MirrorMask is stolen from her, leaving her city vulnerable to the Shadows.

The film also features appearances by Dora Bryan and the voices of Stephen Fry, Lenny Henry, Robert Llewellyn, and others.

==Production==
===Development===
Executive producer Michael Polis mentioned that the idea of creating &quot;MirrorMask&quot; began when The Jim Henson Company and Sony Pictures expressed interest in making a film that would sell as well in video release as &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; based on the two films&#x27; consistent DVD sales in 1999. They had considered creating a prequel to &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; and sequels for &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, but decided that &quot;it made the most sense to try and create something similar or in the spirit of those films and attribute it as a Jim Henson Company fantasy title.&quot;

After being shown a short film directed by McKean, Lisa Henson contacted Gaiman in 2001 about the project, asking if McKean would be interested in directing and if Gaiman was interested in coming up with the story for the film. Gaiman agreed to write for the film if McKean agreed to direct.

Production for the film took seventeen months, with a budget of $4 million. Though limited by the $4 million budget, McKean viewed this as a good thing, saying &quot;It&#x27;s very good to have a box to fight against, and to know where your limitations are, because it immediately implies a certain kind of thing... a certain kind of shape... a certain approach to things.&quot;

===Setting===
According to McKean, the film&#x27;s setting was originally in London, but that had opted to film it in Brighton at producer Simon Moorhead&#x27;s suggestion. McKean described Brighton as &quot;more bohemian, so that fits with the whole circus thing, with Helena&#x27;s family&quot;, and that he liked the specific apartment building - Embassy Court - that they used because &quot;it&#x27;s very distinctive, imposing, it does have this character, but it also represents Helena&#x27;s collapse and her disintegration into this other world and it&#x27;s a potent symbol for her mother.&quot;

===Writing===
McKean and Gaiman worked on the story and concepts for the film over a span of two weeks in February 2002 at the Henson&#x27;s family home. Gaiman stated that he wanted to do &quot;a sort of Prince and Pauper idea. Something with a girl who was somehow split into two girls who became one at the end.&quot; He went on to say that he &quot;had an idea of a girl who was part of a traveling theatre and her mother getting sick and having to go off the road&quot;, and mentioned that McKean preferred to have a circus over a theatre &quot;because it was more interesting visually.&quot; McKean was the one who came up with the idea of the masks and the two mothers. McKean said that &quot;Labyrinth&quot; provided something of a starting point for the project, and that he liked the &quot;human element of that film,&quot; but that ultimately the story of &quot;MirrorMask&quot; was something that he and Gaiman came up with on their own. Gaiman wrote the screenplay in February 2002, and said that they always knew that it would be a coming of age story about a girl on a quest, but that later they learned &quot;that it really was just the story of the relationship between a girl and her mother.&quot;

===Design===
Polis initially spoke to both McKean and Brian Froud, the concept artist for &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. The initial intention was to have McKean direct the film with Froud doing the designs, but Polis stated that it &quot;made more sense&quot; to have McKean do the designs seeing as he was the one directing the film. Since they had a tight budget, McKean designed creatures who were comparatively simple. He assigned entire sequences rather than tiny pieces to individual artists, so that the young professionals working on the film would have the creative opportunity to make part of it their own. He worked with them very closely in a single room. About the animators, he said that, &quot;All but two were straight from art school and almost all from Bournemouth. We took half the class. They all knew each other already.&quot; McKean says that one example of the spirit of the film is that they only had one peach during the filming of the scene where Valentine eats the future fruit. Artist Ian Miller also contributed to the designs of trees and certain other objects in the film, and also provided some of the illustrations pinned to Helena&#x27;s bedroom wall.

===Music===
The music used in the film was composed by Iain Ballamy, McKean&#x27;s friend whom he describes as &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s best sax players&quot; and &quot;a terrific composer.&quot; McKean stated that he &quot;wanted a musical landscape that never quite settled on anywhere geographically or time-wise as well.&quot; He also noted that Ballamy has composed music for and performed in circuses before, and that &quot;[h]e just seemed to be perfect for it.&quot; McKean said that they could not afford to have a full orchestra due to budget constraints, but that they commissioned several of Ballamy&#x27;s contacts to help record the music. Digital recordings were used with the aid of Ashley Slater, but McKean stated that most of the instruments used were real. Swedish singer Josefine Cronholm provided the vocals for the songs used in the film. The circus band are musicians from Farmers Market. The film&#x27;s soundtrack, containing thirty tracks of background music and songs used in the film, was released by La-La Land Records in 2005.

==Release==
The film was first screened at a high school, where it got a positive response. The film also received positive reactions when it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was originally made for a direct-to-video release, but had its limited theatrical release on September 30, 2005, in the United States.

The North American DVD was released on February 14, 2006. The DVD contains additional content such as commentaries, interviews, behind-the-scenes clips, and an art gallery. The film was listed as #31 on the Billboard Top DVD Sales chart the week of March 11, 2006. Neil Gaiman commented that the DVD sold &quot;better than expected&quot; and that it was &quot;gathering an audience&quot;.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
The film grossed a total of $973,613, raising $126,449 on its opening weekend.

=== Critical response ===

The film received mixed reactions from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;While visually dazzling, there isn&#x27;t enough story to hang all the fancy effects on.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 27 reviews.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two out of four stars, praising the film&#x27;s visual artistry but stating that there is &quot;no narrative engine to pull us past the visual scenery&quot;, and that he &quot;suspected the filmmakers began with a lot of ideas about how the movie should look, but without a clue about pacing, plotting or destination.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a rating of A−, saying that the film is a &quot;dazzling reverie of a kids-and-adults movie, an unusual collaboration between lord-of-the-cult multimedia artist Dave McKean and king-of-the-comics Neil Gaiman (&quot;The Sandman&quot;)&quot; and that it &quot;has something to astonish everyone.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film&#x27;s look as &quot;hazy, indistinct, sepia-tinted, overcrowded and flat&quot;, and that &quot;its monochromatic panoramas are too busy and flat to yield an illusion of depth or to convey a feeling of characters moving in space.&quot; He went on to say that the film is &quot;The embodiment of a cult film, one destined for a rich life on home video&quot;. Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as &quot;so single-minded in its reach for fantasy, it becomes the genre&#x27;s evil opposite: banality.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The film was nominated for the Golden Groundhog Award for Best Underground Movie, other nominated films were Lexi Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Green Street&quot;, Rodrigo García&#x27;s &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, the award-winning baseball documentary &quot;Up for Grabs&quot; and &quot;Opie Gets Laid&quot;.

==Other media==
In 2005, Tokyopop, in partnership with The Jim Henson Company, announced plans to publish a manga-style comic prequel to the film, which would center around the Princess&#x27; escape from the Dark Palace and how she acquired the MirrorMask. The manga was reportedly canceled in 2007.

A children&#x27;s book based on the film, authored by Gaiman and illustrated by McKean, was published by HarperCollins Children&#x27;s Books in September 2005. An audiobook based on the children&#x27;s book has also been released by HarperCollins in December 2005. A book containing the film&#x27;s complete storyboard and script as well as some photographs and archival text by Gaiman and McKean, titled &quot;The Alchemy of MirrorMask&quot;, was also published by HarperCollins in November 2005.

The band The Crüxshadows wrote and performed &quot;Wake the White Queen&quot;, which retells the story of &quot;MirrorMask&quot;. This track appears on the Neil Gaiman-inspired compilation album, &quot;Where&#x27;s Neil When You Need Him?&quot;

Dark Horse Comics released a number of &quot;MirrorMask&quot; related merchandise in 2005. Three PVC figure sets, which included three figures per set, were released from May to June 2005. These sets included figures of characters such as Helena, Valentine, the Dark Queen, as well as figures of minor characters like the Librarian and the Small Hairy Guy. A journal made to look like the Really Useful Book, which provided aid for Helena in the film, was released in July 2005, and a seven-inch tall bust of the Dark Queen was released in August 2005.

<text>USS &quot;Huntington&quot; (CL-107), a light cruiser, was the second ship of the United States Navy named after the city of Huntington, West Virginia. She was built during World War II but not completed until after the end of the war and in use for only a few years.

&quot;Huntington&quot; was launched by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, on 8 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. M. L. Jarrett, Jr., and commissioned 23 February 1946.

==Service history==
After shakedown training off Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Huntington&quot; sailed from Philadelphia on 23 July 1946 for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. During the cruise she visited many ports, including Naples, Malta, Villefranche, and Alexandria, helping to stabilize the volatile post-war situation in Europe. Departing Gibraltar on 8 February 1947, she took part in exercises off Guantánamo Bay, stopped at Norfolk and Newport, Rhode Island, and departed the latter port 20 May 1947 for another tour of duty in the Mediterranean.

Returning from her cruise on 13 September 1947, &quot;Huntington&quot; departed Philadelphia on 24 October with Naval Reserve personnel for exercises off Bermuda and Newfoundland until 14 November 1947. The ship then entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and underwent an extensive overhaul until 12 April 1948. During that period Captain Arleigh Burke, future CNO, assumed command in December 1947 until December 1948. Returning to Norfolk on 27 April from her refresher training cruise in the Caribbean, &quot;Huntington&quot; sailed to Newport and departed for another tour of duty in the Mediterranean on 1 June 1948.

&quot;Huntington&quot; visited a variety of ports during June to August 1948, and after transiting the Suez Canal on 22 September, embarked on a good will tour of Africa and South America, arriving Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 6 November. There the ship was honored by an official visit from President Juan Perón, and continuing to Uruguay received a similar visit from President Luis Berres on 10 November. &quot;Huntington&quot; called at Rio de Janeiro and Trinidad before returning from this valuable good will cruise on 8 December 1948.

The cruiser made one short cruise from Philadelphia to the Caribbean, returned to Newport on 22 January, and decommissioned on 15 June 1949. She was finally struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1961 after being in reserve, and was sold to Boston Metals, Baltimore, Maryland, on 16 May 1962. Her name plate is on display at the Freedom Park.

<text>Formula Two (F2 or Formula 2) is a type of open-wheel formula racing category first codified in 1948. It was replaced in 1985 by Formula 3000, but revived by the FIA from 2009–2012 in the form of the FIA Formula Two Championship. The name returned again in 2017 when the former GP2 Series became known as the FIA Formula 2 Championship.

== History ==
While Formula One has generally been regarded as the pinnacle of open-wheeled auto racing, the high-performance nature of the cars and the expense involved in the series has always meant a need for a path to reach this peak. For much of the history of Formula One, Formula Two has represented the penultimate step on the motorsport ladder.

=== Pre-war ===
Prior to the Second World War, there usually existed a division of racing for cars smaller and less powerful than Grand Prix racers. This category was usually called voiturette (&quot;small car&quot;) racing and provided a means for amateur or less experienced drivers and smaller marques to prove themselves. By the outbreak of war, the rules for voiturette racing permitted 1.5 L supercharged engines; Grand Prix cars were permitted 3.0 L supercharged or 4.5 L naturally aspirated.

=== Official beginnings (post war–1953) ===

In 1946, the 3.0 L supercharged rules were abandoned and Formulas A and B (later 1 and 2) introduced, effective from 1 January 1947. Formula A permitted the old 4.5 L naturally aspirated cars, but as the 3.0 L supercharged cars were more than a match for these (and the pre-War German and Italian cars were no longer available), the old 1.5 L &quot;voiturette&quot; formula replaced 3.0 L supercharged cars in an attempt to equalise performance.

This left no category below Formula A/Formula One, so Formula Two (originally known as Formula B) was first formally codified by the FIA as a smaller and cheaper complement to the Grand Prix cars of the era to be effective from 1 January 1948 . Among the races held in this first year of Formula Two was the 1948 Stockholm Grand Prix.

In 1948 Scuderia Ferrari built the Ferrari 166 F2, which made its racing debut at the Florence Grand Prix on September 26, 1948.

The rules limited engines to two-litre naturally aspirated or 500 cc supercharged (an option very rarely used). As a result, the cars were smaller, lighter, and cheaper than those used in Formula One. This encouraged new marques such as Cooper to move up to Formula Two, before competing against large manufacturers like Alfa Romeo and Maserati.

In fact, Formula One in its early years attracted so few entrants that in 1952 and 1953 all World Championship Grand Prix races, except the unique Indianapolis 500, were run in Formula Two (there were, however, non-championship Formula One events).

=== 1.5-litre era (1957–1960) ===

F2 went into decline with the arrival of the 2.5 L F1 in 1954 (with small-capacity sports car racing becoming particularly popular), but a new Formula Two was introduced for 1957, for 1.5 L cars. This became dominated by rear-engined Coopers drawing on their Formula 3 and &quot;Bobtail&quot; sports car, with Porsches based on their RSK sports cars enjoying some success. Ferrari originally developed their &quot;Sharknose&quot; Dino 156 as a Formula Two car, while still racing front-engined Grand Prix cars. The dominant engine of this formula was the Coventry Climax FPF four-cylinder, with the rare Borgward sixteen-valve unit enjoying some success.

A slightly enlarged version of the F2 Cooper won the first two Formula One Grands Prix in 1958, marking the beginning of the rear-engined era in Formula One. The 1.5 L formula was short-lived, with Formula Junior effectively replacing first Formula Three and then Formula Two until 1963—but the 1961 1.5 L Formula One was effectively a continuation of this Formula Two. For 1960, in preparation for the new Formula One, two international championships were held, the Formula Two Constructors&#x27; Championship and the Formula Two Drivers&#x27; Championship. The Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Jack Brabham, while the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship ended in a tie between Porsche and Cooper.

=== Formula Junior (1961–1963) and 1-litre Formula Two (1964–1966) ===
Formula Junior was introduced in 1959, an attempt to be all things to all people (both a training formula replacing Formula Three and a high-level international category below Formula One replacing Formula Two), and it was soon realised that there was a need to split it into two new formulae; Formula Two and Formula Three were reintroduced for the 1964 season, with Formula Three requiring one-litre production-based engines, which were similar to Formula Junior with very restricted tuning, and Formula Two also having a 1.0 L engine size, but permitting pure-bred racing engines. Formula Two was largely the domain of Formula One stars on their days off. Engines were mostly by Cosworth (based on Ford blocks) and Honda, though some other units appeared, including various Fiat based units and dedicated racing engines from BMC and BRM.

=== 1.6-litre era and driver grading (1967–1971) ===
For 1967, the FIA increased the maximum engine capacity to 1600cc. With the &quot;return to power&quot; of Formula One the gap between Formula One and Formula Two was felt to be too wide, and the introduction of new 1600cc production-based engine regulations for Formula Two restored the category to its intended role as a feeder series for Formula One. The FIA also introduced the European Formula Two Championship in 1967. Ickx, driving a Matra MS5, won the inaugural championship by 11 points from the Australian, Frank Gardner.

The most popular 1600cc engine was the Cosworth FVA, the sixteen-valve head on a four-cylinder Cortina block that was effectively the &quot;proof of concept&quot; for the legendary DFV. The 1967 FVA gave at 9000 rpm. Other units also appeared, including a four-cylinder BMW and a V6 Dino Ferrari.

Nevertheless, many Formula One drivers continued to drive the smaller and lighter cars on non-championship weekends, and some Grand Prix grids (notably in Germany, where the long circuit at the Nürburgring could cope with large entries) would be a mix of Formula One and Formula Two cars. Jacky Ickx made his Grand Prix debut at the Nürburgring in a Formula Two car in 1966. The following year Ickx qualified with the third fastest time overall but was forced to start behind the slower Formula One cars. Ickx quickly forced his way back into a points position, only to be forced to retire with broken suspension. Jim Clark, regarded as one of the greatest race drivers of all time, was killed in a Formula Two race early in 1968, at the Hockenheimring. A year later Gerhard Mitter was killed at the Nürburgring while practising for the 1969 German Grand Prix in a Formula Two car.

The &quot;invasion&quot; of Formula One drivers in Formula Two ranks (a situation similar to that of buschwhacking in modern-day NASCAR) was permitted because of the unique grading system used. Any driver with an &quot;A&quot; grading was not permitted to score championship points. A driver gained an &quot;A&quot; rating via various means which changed somewhat over the years, such as finishing in the points in two Grand Prix events or the top three in two World Sports Car events. The annual Formula Two champion was also granted an &quot;A&quot; rating for one year, and a Formula One World Champion was &quot;A&quot; graded for five. This system permitted less experienced drivers to work towards the championship and forward their careers, while allowing senior drivers to keep their hand in during the long breaks between Grands Prix of the time.

In the early years of the 1600cc formula, Brabham and Lotus were the most numerous constructors, although Ferrari intermittently entered a works team, as did BMW (with Lola and Dornier-built chassis). A number of smaller constructors such as Matra and Tecno were successful. Chevron also provided cars. The French firm Matra won the three first editions of the European championship, with Tecno winning the fourth.

=== 2.0-litre era (1972–1984) ===
In 1972, the formula was changed to increase power by permitting 2.0 L production-based engines—Cosworth BDs and BMW four-cylinder engines dominated the early years, with BMW-powered Marches gradually establishing dominance. For 1976, engines developed purely for racing were permitted to compete, with Renault developing a particularly potent V6; allied to a sponsorship scheme from oil company Elf the formula was briefly dominated by French teams and drivers; BMW started to back a works March team and raised the stakes in the late-Seventies. Even the Ferrari engine returned briefly with minimal success. The Hart 420R (ultimately derived from the Cosworth BDA) was briefly successful in Marches and Team Surtees won the European F2 Championship in 1972 with Hart engines, driver Mike Hailwood, but most notably in the works Toleman team&#x27;s cars. Dominant chassis of this era were generally from March and Ralt, with Chevron, the French Elf and Martinis and German Maurers being briefly successful.

Honda returned to Formula Two in the early 1980s with a powerful V6, but this was very much a &quot;works&quot; engine and the cost of competing with the works Ralt-Honda team became prohibitive. As a result, grids diminished in size and declining interest in the series threatened it with extinction.

=== Superseded ===
After the 1984 season, the FIA replaced Formula Two with the newly created Formula 3000 category, which was designed to cut the cost of competition. The initial regulations joined F2-style chassis with the naturally aspirated 3000 cc Cosworth DFV V8 engines, that were by then obsolete in the all-turbocharged Formula One. The premier series was the FIA Formula 3000 International Championship, though a number of other championships were also run to Formula 3000 regulations.

=== Revival (2009–2012) ===
Following an absence of 25 years, a Formula Two championship was re-established by the FIA in 2009. Unlike the previous incarnation, the FIA Formula Two Championship was a one make series, with the competitors all using the same chassis and engine. Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s MotorSport Vision company managed the championship and also operated and maintained the cars on behalf of the drivers. There were no teams in the championship – unlike other professional motorsport series each driver instead worked with engineers supplied by MotorSport Vision. The cars were designed by Williams Grand Prix Engineering, and were powered by a 1.8L turbocharged Audi engine developed by Mountune Racing, with . The cars fell between Formula One and Formula Three in performance, and cost each driver £195,000 for a season.

The 2009 championship comprised eight events in Europe between the months of May and November. There were two races per weekend – each 110 km long (around 40 minutes). Two 30-minute practice sessions and two 30-minute qualifying sessions preceded both races. The inaugural championship was won by Andy Soucek although was marred by the death of Henry Surtees during the fourth round at Brands Hatch.

The series was discontinued by the FIA and MSV after the 2012 season. The championship had struggled to attract enough drivers in the final year, with the single team concept proving to be unpopular compared to championships run on a more conventional basis. Despite being marketed as a feeder series for Formula One, the competing GP2 and Formula Renault 3.5 series had significantly more powerful cars, and no Formula Two driver had managed to progress to a Formula One team until Jolyon Palmer in 2016 with Renault Sport F1 Team.

=== Second revival (2017) ===

In 2015, the FIA announced plans to overhaul the Super Licence system, streamlining the qualification criteria and weighting the various feeder series to allow drivers a more linear progress system. Included with this were plans for a revival of the Formula Two category, which was given priority over all other categories of competition. Further details were published by the World Motorsport Council, revealing plans to model the new Formula Two championship along the same lines as the revived European Formula 3 Championship and the newly introduced Formula 4 category. The series will be a part of the FIA Global Pathway.

Rather than reviving the series by creating a new one where none had previously existed, the FIA chose to rebrand the GP2 Series as the &quot;FIA Formula 2 Championship&quot; in early 2017. Since then, drivers to have graduated to F1 include Charles Leclerc, George Russell and Oscar Piastri. All eleven teams run the Dallara F2 2024 chassis, powered by a Mecachrome engine.

== Other Formula Two series ==

=== Soviet Formula 2 Championship ===
The Central Automotoclub of the USSR (CAMK) joined the FIA in October 1956, aiming to develop Soviet motorsport after seeing international races like the British F1 GP. In 1959, CAMK introduced a new classification system for racing cars in the USSR. However, F2 cars were not part of the 1960 Soviet motorsport championship because there were no suitable stock engines available, and the Soviet Union did not produce specialized racing engines at that time. Consequently, it wasn&#x27;t until 1962 that the F2 category made its debut in Soviet autosport championships. Two years later, updated F2 regulations were introduced. It wasn&#x27;t until 1971 that F2 cars started to regularly appear on Soviet tracks, and F2 series were included in Soviet motorsport championships until 1977.

=== Japanese Formula Two ===
Prior to the Formula Nippon, during the 1.6 L 1967–1971 era, a Formula 2 series championship existed in Japan. Japanese teams were building their own cars and engines. As for races ran in Europe, the series was simply called Formula 2. Amongst the makes, the best known was the Mitsubishi Colt. Cars raced with parallel FIA rules, using 1600 cc displacement engines, from 1967 to 1970.

Japan ran a series known as &quot;Japanese Formula 2000 championship&quot; to rules similar to two-litre F2 between 1973 and 1977. Production-based single-cam engines were permitted to run at 2.4 L, but they soon came into line with FIA rules in the mid-1970s. The Japanese Formula 2 championship ran between 1978 and 1986, before Japan too adopted a set of regulations very similar to F3000 rules, with the series being known as Japanese Formula 3000 from 1987. The series is now known as Super Formula, after using the name Formula Nippon from 1996 to 2012. Japan also ran a series for full-bodied versions of F2 cars called &quot;Fuji Grand Champion Series&quot;—somewhat akin to the F5000-based revival of Can-Am.

=== Australian Formula 2 ===

Australia has had its own Australian Formula 2 category since 1964. From 1978 the formula has specified that cars be powered by a production-based single-cam engine with a capacity between 1100 cc and 1600 cc. Induction must be by means of carburettor/s, the engine must be naturally aspirated and an 8500 rpm rev limit is applied.

An Australian Formula 2 Championship was sanctioned by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport in the years from 1964 to 1965, from 1969 to 1977 and from 1979 to 1988.

=== Mexican Formula Two ===
Mexico ran its own Formula Two series (previously known as Formula K) for 12 years in the early 1990s. The cars were similar to Formula Atlantic vehicles, fitted with 2.2 L Chrysler engines.

=== British Formula Two ===

Formula Two racing was popular in the United Kingdom in the late 1940s and early 1950s. During the 2.0 litre engine era, HWM, Connaught and Cooper were among the constructors who built cars for the class, usually powered by Bristol. When F2 was brought back in 1.5 litre form in 1956, Cooper and Lotus were the first to build cars to the new specification, taking advantage of the availability of Coventry Climax engines.

Championships were held from 1956 to 1960, 1964 to 1967 and again in 1972. Stirling Moss, Jack Brabham, Jim Clark and Niki Lauda won titles.

The British Formula 3000 series was briefly known as &quot;Formula Two&quot; in an attempt to make its status more apparent to casual spectators. However, the series was in terminal decline and the change of name did not help. At one point the use of 4.2 L TVR engines cars in F3000 chassis was discussed as a possible British F2, but this did not materialise.

=== Trophées de France ===

Prior to the formation of the European Championship, France held its own, very popular championship between 1964 and 1967. Despite only running for four seasons, the Brabham marque won three titles, with the drivers going to Jack Brabham (twice), Jim Clark and Jochen Rindt. Races were held at some of the most legendary venues in France, Pau, Clermont-Ferrand and Reims, to name just three.

However once the European Championship had successfully completed this first season, the French version was abandoned.

<doc id="550496" wikidata="Q375793" url="?curid=550496" title="Wire-tailed swallow">
<text>The wire-tailed swallow (Hirundo smithii) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family. It has two subspecies: &quot;H. s. smithii&quot;, which occurs throughout Africa, and &quot;H. s. filifera&quot;, which is found in southern and southeastern Asia. It is mainly resident, but populations in Pakistan and northern India migrate further south in winter. The genus name &quot;Hirundo&quot; is the Latin word for swallow. The species name &quot;smithii&quot; commemorates Christen Smith, a Norwegian botanist and geologist.

==Description==
The wire-tailed swallow is a small swallow, measuring in length. It has bright blue upperparts, bright white underparts and a chestnut cap. Immature birds lack tail wires, and have dull brown (rather than chestnut) caps. The species is named for the very long filamentous outermost tail feathers, which trail behind like two wires. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the female has shorter &quot;wires&quot;. Juveniles have a brown crown, back and tail. The Asian form, &quot;H. s. filifera&quot;, is larger and longer-tailed than the abundant African &quot;H. s. smithii&quot;.

==Habits==
This bird is found in open country near water and human habitation. Wire-tailed swallows are fast flyers and they generally feed on insects, especially flies, while airborne. They are typically seen low over water, with which they are more closely associated than most swallows.
==Nesting==
The neat half-bowl nests are lined with mud collected in the swallows&#x27; beaks. They are placed on vertical surfaces near water under cliff ledges or nowadays more commonly on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. The clutch is three to four eggs in Africa, up to five in Asia (Turner and Rose). These birds are solitary and territorial nesters, unlike many swallows, which tend to be colonial.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The wire-tailed swallow is a member of the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot;, a group of &quot;barn swallows&quot;. It has two subspecies:
* &quot;H. s. smithii&quot; was first described by William Elford Leach and K. D. Koenig in 1818. Known as the African wire-tailed swallow, it is found throughout Africa.
* &quot;H. s. filifera&quot; was first described by Stephens in 1826. Also known as the Asian wire-tailed swallow, it is found in southern and southeastern Asia.

<text>William Wayne Blanks (born September 1, 1955) is an American actor, martial artist and fitness personality. He was a nationally ranked competitor in semi-contact and point karate during the 1980s, winning a bronze medal at the 1981 World Games, before creating the Tae Bo exercise program.

==Early life and education==
Blanks was born in Erie, Pennsylvania. He began his study of the martial arts at the age of eleven, attending Karate and Taekwondo classes. He was born with an anomaly in his hip joints that impaired his movement. The resulting clumsiness aroused taunts from Blanks&#x27; siblings and led his instructors to believe that he would never accomplish much. Blanks found the answer to these challenges in karate. When he saw Bruce Lee on TV, he decided he wanted to be a world martial-arts champion.

== Martial arts ==
Blanks holds black belt ranks in taekwondo (7th &quot;dan&quot;) and karate (5th &quot;dan&quot;), and a black sash in Hung Ga kung fu (under Sifu Wong Ting-fong).

During the 1980s, Blanks was a top competitor of the point competition, semi-contact, and sport karate circuits, notably against Steve Anderson. He finished in 3rd place at the World Union of Karate-do Organizations (WUKO) World Championship in the Male Kumite category in 1980. He represented the United States at the 1981 World Games in Santa Clara, California, and won a bronze medal in the Men&#x27;s Kumite Open (Heavyweight). He was &quot;Karate Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s National Champion and Rookie of the Year for 1983.

Blanks was an early member of USA Karate, the precursor to USA National Karate-do Federation, after it broke away from the Amateur Athletic Union. He also was a member of Chuck Merriman&#x27;s Atlantic World Karate Team with Anderson.

==Career==
Blanks was hired as a bodyguard for lead actress Catherine Bach during the filming of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Driving Force&quot;, which was filmed in Manila during a time of political unrest. Blanks impressed the producers and was written into the script in a supporting role. This led to Blanks&#x27; work in several martial arts films, including &quot;King of the Kickboxers&quot; and &quot;Bloodfist&quot;. Blanks also appeared in the opening scene of Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, where he plays a doomed pro-football player. Blanks played Ashley Judd&#x27;s kickboxing instructor in &quot;Kiss the Girls (&quot;1997).

In the late 1980s, Blanks developed the Tae Bo workout, while running a karate studio in Quincy, Massachusetts. He used components of his martial arts and boxing training. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;tae&quot; (as in taekwondo) and &quot;bo&quot; (as in boxing). Blanks opened a fitness center in Los Angeles to teach his new workout. He later attracted celebrity clients such as Paula Abdul, and the popularity of the workout quickly grew, becoming a pop culture phenomenon after Blanks began releasing mass-marketed videos. He sold over 1.5 million VHS tapes in his first year, and is reported to have grossed between $80 million and $130 million in sales.

==Personal life==
Blanks is a Christian and released a special line of Tae Bo workouts called the &quot;Believer&#x27;s&quot; series that includes motivational prayers and other Christian components. He has appeared on the Christian television network TBN. He attended Crenshaw Christian Center.

In 1974, Blanks married Gayle H. Godfrey, whom he met in karate class. Shortly after the marriage, he adopted Gayle&#x27;s daughter, Shellie, who was born in 1973. Shellie Blanks Cimarosti, a martial artist, is prominently featured in many Tae Bo videos. Shellie has also produced her own video called &quot;Tae Bo Postnatal Power&quot;, as well as hosted her father&#x27;s new infomercial Tae Bo T3 (Total Transformation Training). Gayle and Blanks also have a son, Billy Blanks Jr., who works as a fitness instructor. Blanks Jr. produced several best-selling DVDs, including &quot;Cardioke&quot; and &quot;Fat Burning Hip Hop Mix&quot;. He has also starred in a touring production of the musical &quot;Fame&quot;, and has worked as a dancer in music videos with Madonna, Quincy Jones and Paula Abdul.

Blanks and Godfrey divorced in 2008 after 33 years of marriage. Godfrey filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.

In November 2008, Blanks became the father of a new daughter, named Angelika. The mother is Tomoko Sato, whom Blanks met in 2007 when she worked as his Japanese interpreter. Blanks and Sato&#x27;s marriage was formally registered in January 2009 and their wedding ceremony was held on June 20, 2009. He relocated to Japan in 2009.

<text>Thomas Caverhill Jerdon (12 October 1811 – 12 June 1872) was an English physician, zoologist and botanist. He was a pioneering ornithologist who described numerous species of birds in India. Several species of plants (including the genus &quot;Jerdonia&quot;) and birds including Jerdon&#x27;s baza, Jerdon&#x27;s leafbird, Jerdon&#x27;s bushlark, Jerdon&#x27;s nightjar, Jerdon&#x27;s courser, Jerdon&#x27;s babbler and Jerdon&#x27;s bush chat are named after him.

==Early life==
Thomas was the eldest son of Archibald Jerdon of Bonjedward, near Jedburgh, and was born at Biddick House in County Durham.

His early education was at Bishopton Grove near Ripon and later at Bawtry near Doncaster. His father influenced an interest in natural history and although not a well-known naturalist, he was a careful observer and while Thomas took an interest mainly in zoology, his younger brother became an active botanist. Thomas joined Edinburgh University in 1828 as a literary student but attended classes in natural history by Professor Robert Jameson. He joined the Plinian Society, an association of naturalists (another member of which was Charles Darwin), on 23 June 1829. He graduated as a medical student in 1829-1830 and continued medical studies before obtaining an assistant surgeonship in the East India Company&#x27;s service. He was appointed on 11 September 1835 and he arrived at Madras on 21 February 1836.

==India==

His initial work in India was in dealing with fever and dysentery that affected the troops posted in the Ganjam district. During this posting, he described the birds of the Eastern Ghats. On 1 March 1837 he moved to the 2nd Light Cavalry and was posted at Trichinopoly and moved with the regiment to Jalnah in central India. He remained in the Deccan region for the next four years. In 1841 he visited the Nilgiri Hills on leave and in July of the same year he married Flora Alexandrina Matilda Macleod, niece of General Lewis Wentworth Watson. Flora had an interest in botanical art and took an interest in orchids. She was also an excellent guitarist. Around 1845 the Jerdon&#x27;s lived in their Ooty home &quot;Woodside&quot;, (&quot;Woodside&quot; originally belonged to General Watson) and their children were baptised at the local St. Stephens church. Six months later he was appointed Civil Surgeon of Nellore. At Nellore, he interacted with the Yanadi tribes and obtained information on local names of birds and studied the natural history of the area. On 25 October 1844 he was transferred to Fort St. George as Garrison Assistant-Surgeon. During this time he took an interest in the fishes of the Bay of Bengal. On 12 February 1847 he was appointed Civil Surgeon of Tellicherry. This position led him to describe many species from the Malabar region including ants such as the distinctive &quot;Harpegnathos saltator&quot;. He resigned from civil charge on 3 June 1851 and was promoted as Surgeon with the 4th Light Cavalry in Sagar on 29 February 1852. After peace regained following the 1857 revolts, he was made Surgeon Major on 1 October 1858. He subsequently went to Darjeeling on sick leave and studied the Himalayan fauna before joining back into the 11th Native Infantry regiment in Burma and making use of that opportunity to study the region. Around 1861 a mission to Tibet was to be conducted by Captain E. Smythe and Jerdon was to accompany the group (which included Dr Stewart of the Saharanpur botanical garden; Capt. Bassevi, meteorologist; and Medlicott, geologist) as botanist but failure to obtain passports from Pekin led to the mission being cancelled. Around the same time Lord Canning enabled him to take special duty that would allow him to work on the publication of a series of books on the vertebrates of India. This began with his works on the &quot;Birds of India&quot;, followed by works on the mammals, reptiles and fish. On 28 February 1868 he retired from service and he was given the honorary position of Deputy Inspector-General of hospitals in Madras on 28 October 1868. While still in Gauhati, Assam he suffered a severe attack of fever and moved to Calcutta to convalesce but his condition deteriorated leading to his return to England in June 1870. In 1871 he became a member of the Berwickshire Natural History Society and joined them on walks. His health however continued to decline and he died at Aubyns Road, Upper Norwood on 12 June 1872, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery (the memorial no longer stands). He discussed the birds of India with his neighbourhood friend and ornithologist Dresser just hours before his death. Flora died at her home in 40 Marina on 24 August 1910 and was buried at the Hastings Borough Cemetery.

==Natural history==
Jerdon started collecting birds almost immediately on arrival in India on 21 February 1836. He sent his collections of birds collected during his early travels to William Jardine for identification, but by the time they arrived at Jardine&#x27;s house in Scotland they had become infested by moths. Jerdon trusted his own identifications from then on, publishing &quot;A Catalogue of the Birds of the Indian Peninsula&quot; for the &quot;Madras Journal of Literature and Science&quot; (1839–40). This included 420 species, almost doubling the list produced earlier by Colonel W. H. Sykes.


The want of brief, but comprehensive Manual of the Natural History of India has been long felt by all interested in such inquiries. At the present, it is necessary to search through voluminous transactions of learned Societies, and scientific Journals, to obtain any general acquaintance with what has been already ascertained regarding the Fauna of India, and, excepting to a few more favorably placed, even these are inaccessible. The issue of a Manual, which should comprise all available information in sufficient detail for the discrimination and identification of such objects of Natural History as might be met with, without being rendered cumbrous by minutiae of synonymy or of history, has therefore long been considered a desideratum.
To meet this want it is proposed to publish a series of such Manuals for all the Vertebrated Animals of India, containing characters of all the classes, orders, families, and genera, and descriptions of all the species of all Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes, found in India.

Jerdon&#x27;s most important publication was &quot;The Birds of India&quot; (1862–64), which included over 1008 species in two volumes with the second volume in two parts. This work was dedicated to Lord Canning and Lord Elgin who supported the venture. 
This work was not without its critics. A reviewer pointed out that Jerdon seemed unaware of the significance of geographic distributions in evolutionary relatedness. Jerdon was an admirer of the Quinarian classification of William Swainson. Jerdon&#x27;s opinion on Darwin&#x27;s theory was that it &quot;&quot;perhaps, lays too much stress on external and fortuitous circumstances as producing varieties, and not enough on the inherent power of change.&quot; The reviewer also pointed out problems in his usage of George Gray&#x27;s arrangement of the bird classes and states: &quot;In thus following the phantasies of Kaup, and the mad vagaries of Bonaparte (in his latest writings), we cannot believe that Dr. Jerdon has acted well for his own reputation, nor wisely as regards the class of readers for whom his volumes are specially intended.&quot;&quot; Jerdon documented the local names of many birds although he did not follow a consistent spelling for Hindi and Urdu words.

Jerdon&#x27;s other major work was the &quot;Illustrations of Indian Ornithology&quot; in 1844, which included illustration made by Indian artists (some from Trichinopoly), about which he wrote in his later works:
Other works included &quot;The Game Birds and Wildfowl of India&quot; (1864) and &quot;Mammals of India&quot; (1874). He had a wide interest in natural history and his studies include descriptions of plants, ants, amphibians, reptiles, birds as well as mammals. Jerdon was instrumental in the birth of &quot;The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma&quot; series. The need for a work on the Indian fauna was felt and it was finally approved by the Secretary of state and was placed under the editorship of W. T. Blanford.

R. A. Sterndale mentions a note from Jerdon on an otter that he kept as a pet (probably at Tellicherry)
His work on the reptiles of India was not completed and it was only after his death that the proofs were sent to his home. In 1874 several volumes with his original drawings of reptiles were auctioned by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. Some of these illustrations were purchased by Lord Lilford. Apart from zoology, he also took an interest in botany, although he did not publish on the topic and instead communicated notes to botanists such as Robert Wight. Wight notes that:
In his personal matters he was said to be careless and forgetful. He often had trouble with his creditors and during the time of his death he was found to be insolvent. Jerdon has also been noted as being rash. On one occasion, he tried catching a cobra by the tail and got bitten on the tip of finger which he slashed with a pocket knife. He was also nearly strangled by a pet python that he kept.

==Eponyms==

Jerdon is honored in the specific names of three species of lizards (&quot;Calotes jerdoni&quot;, &quot;Cnemaspis jerdonii&quot;, &quot;Ophisops jerdonii)&quot; and three species of snakes (&quot;Hydrophis jerdonii&quot;, &quot;Protobothrops jerdonii&quot;, &quot;Indotyphlops jerdoni)&quot;. Francis Day named two species of fishes, &quot;Hypselobarbus jerdoni&quot; and &quot;Amblypharyngodon jerdoni&quot;, after Jerdon, the latter however is a junior synonym.

==Writings==
Jerdon wrote several books and contributed regularly to the proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and to that of the Madras Literary Society apart from journals abroad including the &quot;Ibis&quot; and the &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot;. A selection of his writings include:

<text>The vestibular system, in vertebrates, is a sensory system that creates the sense of balance and spatial orientation for the purpose of coordinating movement with balance. Together with the cochlea, a part of the auditory system, it constitutes the labyrinth of the inner ear in most mammals.

As movements consist of rotations and translations, the vestibular system comprises two components: the semicircular canals, which indicate rotational movements; and the otoliths, which indicate linear accelerations. The vestibular system sends signals primarily to the neural structures that control eye movement; these provide the anatomical basis of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is required for clear vision. Signals are also sent to the muscles that keep an animal upright and in general control posture; these provide the anatomical means required to enable an animal to maintain its desired position in space.

The brain uses information from the vestibular system in the head, and from proprioception throughout the body to enable an understanding of the body&#x27;s dynamics and kinematics (including its position and acceleration) from moment to moment. How these two perceptive sources are integrated to provide the underlying structure of the sensorium is unknown.

==Semicircular canal system==

The semicircular canal system detects rotational movements. Semicircular canals are its main tools to achieve this detection.

===Structure===
Since the world is three-dimensional, the vestibular system contains three semicircular canals in each labyrinth. They are approximately orthogonal (at right angles) to each other, and are the &quot;horizontal&quot; (or &quot;lateral&quot;), the &quot;anterior semicircular canal&quot; (or &quot;superior&quot;), and the &quot;posterior&quot; (or &quot;inferior&quot;) semicircular canal. Anterior and posterior canals may collectively be called &quot;vertical semicircular canals&quot;.
# Movement of fluid within the horizontal semicircular canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis (i.e. the neck), as when doing a pirouette.
# The anterior and posterior semicircular canals detect rotations of the head in the sagittal plane (as when nodding), and in the frontal plane, as when cartwheeling. Both anterior and posterior canals are oriented at approximately 45° between frontal and sagittal planes.
The movement of fluid pushes on a structure called the cupula which contains hair cells that transduce the mechanical movement to electrical signals.

===Push-pull systems===
The canals are arranged in such a way that each canal on the left side has an almost parallel counterpart on the right side. Each of these three pairs works in a &quot;push-pull&quot; fashion: when one canal is stimulated, its corresponding partner on the other side is inhibited, and vice versa.

This push-pull system makes it possible to sense all directions of rotation: while the &quot;right horizontal canal&quot; gets stimulated during head rotations to the right (Fig 2), the &quot;left horizontal canal&quot; gets stimulated (and thus predominantly signals) by head rotations to the left.

Vertical canals are coupled in a crossed fashion, i.e. stimulations that are excitatory for an anterior canal are also inhibitory for the contralateral posterior, and vice versa.

===Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)===

The vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. Since slight head movements are present all the time, the VOR is very important for stabilizing vision: patients whose VOR is impaired find it difficult to read because they cannot stabilize the eyes during small head tremors. The VOR reflex does not depend on visual input and works even in total darkness or when the eyes are closed.

This reflex, combined with the push-pull principle described above, forms the physiological basis of the &quot;Rapid head impulse test&quot; or &quot;Halmagyi-Curthoys-test&quot;, in which the head is rapidly and forcefully moved to the side while observing whether the eyes keep looking in the same direction.

===Mechanics===

The mechanics of the semicircular canals can be described by a damped oscillator. If we designate the deflection of the cupula with formula_1, and the head velocity with formula_2, the cupula deflection is approximately

: formula_3

α is a proportionality factor, and &quot;s&quot; corresponds to the frequency. For fluid simulations, the endolymph has roughly the same density and viscosity as water. The cupula has the same density as endolymph, and it is a jelly mostly made of polysaccharides with Young&#x27;s modulus formula_4. 

T1 is the characteristic time required for the cupula to accelerate until it reaches terminal velocity, and T2 is the characteristic time required for the cupula to relax back to neutral position. The cupula has a small inertia compared to the elastic force (due to the jelly) and the viscous force (due to the endolymph), so T1 is very small compared to T2. For humans, the time constants T1 and T2 are approximately 5 ms and 20 s, respectively. As a result, for typical head movements, which cover the frequency range of 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz, the deflection of the cupula is approximately proportional to the head velocity. This is very useful since the velocity of the eyes must be opposite to the velocity of the head to maintain clear vision.

===Central processing===

Signals from the vestibular system also project to the cerebellum (where they are used to keep the VOR effective, a task usually referred to as &quot;learning&quot; or &quot;adaptation&quot;) and to different areas in the cortex. The projections to the cortex are spread out over different areas, and their implications are currently not clearly understood.

===Projection pathways===

The vestibular nuclei on either side of the brainstem exchange signals regarding movement and body position. These signals are sent down the following projection pathways.
# To the cerebellum. Signals sent to the cerebellum are relayed back as muscle movements of the head, eyes, and posture.
# To nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Signals sent to these nerves cause the vestibular-ocular reflex. They allow the eyes to fix on a moving object while staying in focus.
# To the reticular formation. Signals sent to the reticular formation signal the new posture the body has taken on, and how to adjust circulation and breathing due to body position.
# To the spinal cord. Signals sent to the spinal cord allow quick reflex reactions to both the limbs and trunk to regain balance.
# To the thalamus. Signals sent to the thalamus allow for head and body motor control as well as being conscious of body position.

==Otolithic organs==
While the semicircular canals respond to rotations, the otolithic organs sense linear accelerations. Humans have two otolithic organs on each side, one called the utricle, the other called the saccule. The utricle contains a patch of hair cells and supporting cells called a macula. Similarly, the saccule contains a patch of hair cells and a macula. Each hair cell of a macula has forty to seventy stereocilia and one true cilium called a kinocilium. The tips of these cilia are embedded in an otolithic membrane. This membrane is weighted down with protein-calcium carbonate granules called otoconia. These otoconia add to the weight and inertia of the membrane and enhance the sense of gravity and motion. With the head erect, the otolithic membrane bears directly down on the hair cells and stimulation is minimal. However, when the head is tilted, the otolithic membrane sags and bends the stereocilia, stimulating the hair cells. Any orientation of the head causes a combination of stimulation to the utricles and saccules of the two ears. The brain interprets head orientation by comparing these inputs to each other and other input from the eyes and stretch receptors in the neck, thereby detecting whether the head is tilted or the entire body is tipping. Essentially, these otolithic organs sense how quickly you are accelerating forward or backward, left or right, or up or down. Most of the utricular signals elicit eye movements, while the majority of the saccular signals projects to muscles that control our posture.

While the interpretation of the rotation signals from the semicircular canals is straightforward, the interpretation of otolith signals is more difficult: since gravity is equivalent to constant linear acceleration, one somehow has to distinguish otolith signals that are caused by linear movements from those caused by gravity. Humans can do that quite well, but the neural mechanisms underlying this separation are not yet fully understood.
Humans can sense head tilting and linear acceleration even in dark environments because of the orientation of two groups of hair cell bundles on either side of the . Hair cells on opposite sides move with mirror symmetry, so when one side is moved, the other is inhibited. The opposing effects caused by a tilt of the head cause differential sensory inputs from the hair cell bundles allowing humans to tell which way the head is tilting. Sensory information is then sent to the brain, which can respond with appropriate corrective actions to the nervous and muscular systems to ensure that balance and awareness are maintained.

==Experience from the vestibular system==
Experience from the vestibular system is called equilibrioception. It is mainly used for the sense of balance and for spatial orientation. When the vestibular system is stimulated without any other inputs, one experiences a sense of self-motion. For example, a person in complete darkness and sitting in a chair will sense that they have turned to the left if the chair is turned to the left. A person in an elevator, with essentially constant visual input, will sense they are descending as the elevator starts to descend. There are a variety of direct and indirect vestibular stimuli which can make people sense they are moving when they are not, not moving when they are, tilted when they are not, or not tilted when they are. Although the vestibular system is a very fast sense used to generate reflexes, including the righting reflex, to maintain perceptual and postural stability, compared to the other senses of vision, touch and audition, vestibular input is perceived with delay.

==Pathologies==

Diseases of the vestibular system can take different forms and usually induce vertigo and instability or loss of balance, often accompanied by nausea. The most common vestibular diseases in humans are vestibular neuritis, a related condition called labyrinthitis, Ménière&#x27;s disease, and BPPV. In addition, the vestibular system&#x27;s function can be affected by tumours on the vestibulocochlear nerve, an infarct in the brain stem or in cortical regions related to the processing of vestibular signals, and cerebellar atrophy.

When the vestibular system and the visual system deliver incongruous results, nausea often occurs. When the vestibular system reports movement but the visual system reports no movement, the motion disorientation is often called motion sickness (or seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness, or airsickness). In the opposite case, such as when a person is in a zero-gravity environment or during a virtual reality session, the disoriented sensation is often called space sickness or space adaptation syndrome. Either of these &quot;sicknesses&quot; usually cease once the congruity between the two systems is restored.

Alcohol can also cause alterations in the vestibular system for short periods and will result in vertigo and possibly nystagmus due to the variable viscosity of the blood and the endolymph during the consumption of alcohol. The term for this is positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN):
# PAN I - The alcohol concentration is higher in the blood than in the vestibular system, hence the endolymph is relatively dense.
# PAN II - The alcohol concentration is lower in the blood than in the vestibular system, hence the endolymph is relatively dilute.

PAN I will result in subjective vertigo in one direction and typically occurs shortly after ingestion of alcohol when blood alcohol levels are highest. PAN II will eventually cause subjective vertigo in the opposite direction. This occurs several hours after ingestion and after a relative reduction in blood alcohol levels.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition resulting in acute symptoms of vertigo. It is probably caused when pieces that have broken off otoliths have slipped into one of the semicircular canals. In most cases, it is the posterior canal that is affected. In certain head positions, these particles shift and create a fluid wave which displaces the cupula of the canal affected, which leads to dizziness, vertigo and nystagmus.

A similar condition to BPPV may occur in dogs and other mammals, but the term &quot;vertigo&quot; cannot be applied because it refers to subjective perception. Terminology is not standardized for this condition.

A common vestibular pathology of dogs and cats is colloquially known as &quot;old dog vestibular disease&quot;, or more formally idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease, which causes a sudden episode of loss of balance, circling head tilt, and other signs. This condition is very rare in young dogs but fairly common in geriatric animals, and may affect cats of any age.

Vestibular dysfunction has also been found to correlate with cognitive and emotional disorders, including depersonalization and derealization.

== Other vertebrates ==
Though humans as well as most other vertebrates exhibit three semicircular canals in their vestibular systems, lampreys and hagfish are vertebrates that deviate from this trend. The vestibular systems of lampreys contain two semicircular canals while those of hagfish contain a single canal. The lamprey&#x27;s two canals are developmentally similar to the anterior and posterior canals found in humans. The single canal found in hagfish appears to be secondarily derived.

Additionally, the vestibular systems of lampreys and hagfish differ from those found in other vertebrates in that the otolithic organs of lampreys and hagfish are not segmented like the utricle and saccule found in humans, but rather form one continuous structure referred to as the macula communis.

Birds possess a &quot;second&quot; vestibular organ in the back, the lumbosacral canals. Behavioral evidence suggests that this system is responsible for stabilizing the body during walking and standing.

== Invertebrates ==

A large variety of vestibular organs are present in invertebrates. A well-known example is the halteres of flies (Diptera) which are modified hind wings.

<text>The Fanti saw-wing (Psalidoprocne obscura), also known as the Fanti rough-winged swallow, is a small passerine bird in the swallow family. The Fanti saw-wing has often described as the most beautiful of the swallows, owing to its uniformly shimmering green plumage.

==Description==
This is a small swallow at 17 cm. Its plumage is glossy green. The tail is long and deeply forked. Sexes are similar, but the female has a shorter tail. Juveniles are brown with little gloss, and have short tails.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Fanti saw-wing breeds in the lowlands of southern west Africa from Senegal to Cameroon. It is mainly resident, apart from seasonal movements. This bird is found in open country, including light woodland, near water. 

Fanti saw-wings are graceful flyers and they generally feed on insects, including beetles, while airborne. They are typically seen low over water or grassland.

The lined nests are built in a 60 cm burrow in a vertical bank. The clutch is two eggs.

<text>Amotz Zahavi () (August 14, 1928 – May 12, 2017) was an Israeli evolutionary biologist, a Professor in the Department of Zoology at Tel Aviv University, and one of the founders of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. His main work concerned the evolution of signals, particularly those signals that are indicative of fitness, and their selection for &quot;honesty&quot;.

==Biography==
Amotz Zahavi was influenced to study zoology by the director of the zoo at Tel Aviv, Heinrich Mendelssohn. He received his Ph.D. from Tel Aviv University in 1970. He was married to Avishag Zahavi, a biologist and a co-investigator. He died in Tel Aviv, Israel on May 12, 2017, aged 88.

==Scientific career==

Zahavi is best known for his work on the handicap principle, which explains the evolution of characteristics, behaviors or structures that appear contrary to the principles of Darwinian evolution in that they appear to reduce fitness and endanger individual organisms. Evolved by sexual selection, these act as signals of the status of the organism, functioning to e. g. attract mates. He expanded it with theories on honest signalling and the idea that selection would favour signals that impose a higher cost, those that are not easily cheated on. He worked in particular on the Arabian babbler, a long-lived and social bird with altruistic behaviour among unrelated individuals, not explainable by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve attractiveness to potential mates, a form of competitive altruism.

Zahavi is credited with co-developing the information centre hypothesis in 1973 with Peter Ward. The information centre hypothesis states that birds live in communal roosts primarily to gain information on food resource locations from other roost individuals.

Towards the end of his life he attempted to apply his theory at the molecular scale and sought to examine for example whether the neurotransmitter acetylcholine was selected due to its toxicity.

==Awards==
In 1980, The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Zahavi and two other colleagues, were awarded the Israel Prize for SPNI&#x27;s special contribution to society and the State, for the environment.

In 2011, Zahavi received the Fyssen Foundation&#x27;s International Prize for the evolution of social communication.

In 2016, Zahavi received a prize for lifetime achievement from the Israel Society of Ecology and Environmental Sciences.

<text>This article lists Presidents of the French Parliament or, as the case may be, of its lower chamber.

The National Constituent Assembly was created in 1789 out of the Estates-General. It, and the revolutionary legislative assemblies that followed – the Legislative Assembly (1791–1792) and the National Convention (1792–1795), had a quickly rotating Presidency. With the establishment of the Directory in 1795, there were two chambers of the French legislature. The lower, the Council of Five Hundred, also had a quickly rotating chairmanship. Under Napoleon I, the Legislative Corps had all authority to actually enact laws, but was essentially a rubberstamp body, lacking the power to debate legislation. With the restoration of the monarchy, a bicameral system was restored, with a Chamber of Peers and a Chamber of Deputies. The Chamber of Deputies, for the first time, had presidents elected for a substantial period of time.

With the revolution of 1848, the monarchical assemblies were dissolved and replaced again with a unicameral National Assembly, which Napoleon III replaced with a new version of his uncle&#x27;s Legislative Corps. With the establishment of the Third Republic, the name of Chamber of Deputies was restored; after 1876 it was joined by a Senate as upper house. The Chamber of Deputies was renamed the National Assembly in the constitution of the Fourth Republic, and is still known as that.

<doc id="550548" wikidata="Q506554" url="?curid=550548" title="Donald Fagen">
<text>Donald Jay Fagen (born January 10, 1948) is an American musician who was the co-founder, lead singer, co-songwriter, and keyboardist of the rock band Steely Dan, formed in the early 1970s with musical partner Walter Becker. In addition to his work with Steely Dan, Fagen has released four solo albums, beginning with &quot;The Nightfly&quot; in 1982, which was nominated for seven Grammys. 

In 2001, Fagen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Steely Dan. Following Becker&#x27;s death in 2017, Fagen continued to tour alone reluctantly under the Steely Dan name.

==Early life==
Fagen was born in Passaic, New Jersey, on January 10, 1948 to Jewish parents, Joseph &quot;Jerry&quot; Fagen, an accountant, and his wife, Elinor, a homemaker who had been a swing singer in upstate New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains from childhood through her teens. His family moved to Fair Lawn, a small town near Passaic. When he was ten years old, he moved with his parents and younger sister to Kendall Park, a newly constructed suburban section of South Brunswick, New Jersey. The transition upset him. He detested living in the suburbs. He later recalled that it &quot;was like a prison. I think I lost faith in [my parents&#x27;] judgment... It was probably the first time I realized I had my own view of life.&quot; His life in Kendall Park, including his teenage love of late-night radio, inspired his later album &quot;The Nightfly&quot;.

Fagen became interested in rock and rhythm and blues in the late 1950s. The first record he bought was &quot;Reelin&#x27; and Rockin&#x27; &quot; by Chuck Berry. At age eleven, his cousin, Barbara Cohen, recommended jazz music and Fagen went to the Newport Jazz Festival, becoming what he called a &quot;jazz snob&quot;: &quot;I lost interest in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and started developing an anti-social personality.&quot; In the early 1960s, beginning at age 12, he often went to the Village Vanguard, where he was particularly impressed by Earl Hines, Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith, and Bill Evans. He regularly took the bus to Manhattan to see performances by jazz musicians Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis. He learned to play the piano, and he played baritone horn in the high school marching band. He developed a lifelong fondness for table tennis. In his late teens he was drawn to soul music, funk, Motown, and Sly and the Family Stone. He has also expressed admiration for the Boswell Sisters, Henry Mancini, and Ray Charles.

After graduating from South Brunswick High School in 1965, he enrolled at Bard College to study English literature, where he met Walter Becker in a coffee house in 1967. Becker and Fagen attracted a revolving assortment of musicians, including future actor Chevy Chase, to form the bands Leather Canary, the Don Fagen Jazz Trio, and the Bad Rock Band. Fagen described his college bands as sounding like &quot;the Kingsmen performing Frank Zappa material&quot;. None of the groups lasted long, but the partnership between Fagen and Becker did. The duo&#x27;s early career included working with Jay and the Americans, for which they used pseudonyms. In the early 1970s they worked as pop songwriters for ABC/Dunhill Records, which released all of Steely Dan&#x27;s 1970s albums.

==Career==

===Steely Dan===

Becker and Fagen began to form Steely Dan in the summer of 1970, responding to a &quot;Village Voice&quot; ad for &quot;a bassist and keyboard player with jazz chops&quot; placed by guitarist Denny Dias. Dias was immediately impressed by the pair&#x27;s abilities, and especially that they already had a whole stack of original material. (Fans of Beat Generation literature, Fagen and Becker named the band after a steam-powered vibrator mentioned in the William S. Burroughs novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.) The group&#x27;s first lineup was assembled in December 1971 in Los Angeles, where Becker and Fagen had relocated to work as staff songwriters for ABC/Dunhill. Becker and Fagen formed the core of the band and wrote all the songs, with Becker on bass, and later lead guitar, and Fagen on keyboards and vocals.

After the release of their third LP in 1974, the other members left or were fired from the band, which evolved into a studio project headed by Becker and Fagen. Steely Dan&#x27;s best-selling album was 1977&#x27;s &quot;Aja&quot;, which was certified platinum. Three years later, they released &quot;Gaucho&quot;. Their next album was not until 1995, when they released the live album &quot;Alive in America&quot;. It was followed by the multiple Grammy Award winning &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; in 2000, and Steely Dan&#x27;s most recent album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; in 2003. A concert DVD, &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;, included material from much of the band&#x27;s history.

After Becker&#x27;s death in 2017, Fagen wished to retire the Steely Dan name out of respect for his bandmate and tour under a different name, but promoters advised him against it for commercial reasons. As of 2024, Fagen continues to tour as Steely Dan.

===Solo career===
After Steely Dan&#x27;s breakup in 1981, Fagen released his debut solo album, &quot;The Nightfly&quot;, in October 1982. It was certified platinum for sales of over a million copies in the U.S. and reached 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums list. The first single, &quot;I.G.Y.&quot;, released in September 1982, peaked at number 26 on the Hot 100. The follow-up single, &quot;New Frontier&quot; (January 1983), peaked at number 70 and was accompanied by a music video. &quot;The Nightfly&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 2002, Rhino Records released a DVD-Audio version of &quot;The Nightfly&quot; in honor of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The bonus track, &quot;True Companion&quot;, from the &quot;Nightfly Trilogy MVI Boxed Set&quot; is track seven on the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; film soundtrack from 1981.

During the rest of the 1980s, Fagen contributed to soundtracks and wrote a column for &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine. In 1988, he released &quot;Century&#x27;s End&quot; from the score to the Michael J. Fox film, &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;. At the close of the decade, he returned to the stage with the New York Rock and Soul Revue. Becker and Fagen reunited in 1986 to work on the debut album by model and singer Rosie Vela. Becker produced Fagen&#x27;s second album, &quot;Kamakiriad&quot; (1993), which was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and reached number 10 on the Top 200 albums chart. Fagen co-produced and played keyboards on Walter Becker&#x27;s solo album debut &quot;11 Tracks of Whack&quot; (1994).

Fagen&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Morph the Cat&quot;, was released on March 14, 2006, and featured Wayne Krantz (guitar), Jon Herington (guitar), Keith Carlock (drums), Freddie Washington (bass), Ted Baker (piano), and Walt Weiskopf (sax). It reached 26 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums list. &quot;Morph the Cat&quot; was named Album of the Year by &quot;Mix&quot; magazine. The 5.1 surround sound mix won the Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album.

In 2007, Fagen&#x27;s first three albums were released in a box set, &quot;Nightfly Trilogy&quot;, in the MVI (Music Video Interactive) format. Each album features DTS 5.1, Dolby 5.1 and PCM Stereo mix but no MLP encoded track, along with bonus audio and video content.

Fagen&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Sunken Condos&quot;, was released in 2012. It reached 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums list. In 2012 he also toured with the Dukes of September, featuring Michael McDonald and Boz Scaggs. One of the concerts was recorded at Lincoln Center in New York City and broadcast on PBS Great Performances in 2014.

In 2013, Fagen published an autobiography titled &quot;Eminent Hipsters&quot;. A biography &quot;Nightfly: The Life of Steely Dan&#x27;s Donald Fagen&quot; by Peter Jones was published in 2022.

Fagen frequently uses aliases. He wrote the liner notes to &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; under the name Tristan Fabriani, which he used on stage when he played keyboards for Jay and the Americans (Becker used Gus Mahler). On his solo albums, when he played or programmed a synthesizer part to replicate a real instrument (bass, vibraphone, horns) he credited one of his aliases: Illinois Elohainu, Phonus Quaver, or Harlan Post.

== Style and themes ==
Fagen has classified himself as both a self-taught pianist and a self-taught vocalist, although he did spend a few semesters studying formally at Berklee College of Music and took some vocal lessons in the mid-1970s as a precaution after feeling the straining effects of years of touring. Although he learned to become an entertainer, early on Fagen suffered from severe stage fright, which prompted Steely Dan producer Gary Katz to hire David Palmer to sing two songs on Steely Dan&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;. This also led to the hiring of Royce Jones and Michael McDonald as singers in the band&#x27;s tours in the early 1970s. Fagen plays the Fender Rhodes electric piano and Wurlitzer electric piano.

According to Robert Christgau, in terms of lyrics, Fagen is a &quot;pathological ironist&quot; who &quot;doesn&#x27;t much care about hippies&quot; or the message of his generation&#x27;s counterculture: &quot;His &#x27;60s are the Kennedy years, when a smart, somewhat shallow suburban white kid could dream of Brubeck and bohemia and bomb-shelter wingdings and transoceanic rail links to exotic locales.&quot;

==Personal life==
Fagen&#x27;s cousin Alan Rosenberg is an actor who was president of the Screen Actors Guild, while his cousin Mark Rosenberg was an activist in Students for a Democratic Society and a film producer.

In 1993 Fagen married songwriter Libby Titus. Although the two attended Bard College at around the same time, they did not become friends until 1987 when they were backstage at a Dr. John concert. On January 4, 2016, Titus sustained injuries after Fagen allegedly shoved her against a marble window frame at their Upper East Side apartment.

Titus co-wrote the song &quot;Florida Room&quot; on the 1993 album &quot;Kamakiriad&quot;. Fagen has performed with his stepdaughter Amy Helm, daughter of Titus and musician Levon Helm. Fagen has no children of his own. Titus died on October 13, 2024.

<text>Walter Carl Becker (February 20, 1950 – September 3, 2017) was an American musician, songwriter, and record producer. He was the co-founder, guitarist, bassist, and co-songwriter of the jazz rock band Steely Dan.

Becker met future songwriting partner Donald Fagen while they were students at Bard College. After a brief period of activity in New York City, the two moved to Los Angeles in 1971 and formed the nucleus of Steely Dan, which enjoyed a critically and commercially successful ten-year career. Following the group&#x27;s dissolution, Becker moved to Hawaii and reduced his musical activity, working primarily as a record producer. In 1985, he briefly became a member of the English band China Crisis, producing and playing synthesizer on their album &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection&quot;.

Becker and Fagen reformed Steely Dan in 1993 and remained active, recording &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; (2000), which won four Grammy Awards. Becker released two solo albums, &quot;11 Tracks of Whack&quot; (1994) and &quot;Circus Money&quot; (2008). Following a brief battle with esophageal cancer, he died on September 3, 2017. He and Fagen are the only two members of Steely Dan who appeared on every studio album by the band.

==Early life and career (1950–1971)==
Becker was born in Queens, New York City. After Becker&#x27;s parents separated when he was a boy, his British mother returned to England. Becker was made to believe by his father and grandmother that his mother was deceased, but at some point between his childhood and late adolescence, he discovered that she was living, and he maintained a rocky relationship with her from then on. He was raised in Queens and Scarsdale, New York by his father and his grandmother. His father, Carl Becker, sold paper-cutting machinery in Manhattan where Walter graduated from Stuyvesant High School. After starting out on saxophone, he switched to guitar and received instruction in blues technique from neighbor Randy California, who later formed the band Spirit.

Donald Fagen overheard Becker playing guitar at a campus coffee shop, the Red Balloon, when they were both students at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. In a 2007 interview Fagen said, &quot;I hear this guy practicing, and it sounded very professional and contemporary. It sounded like, you know, like a black person, really.&quot; They formed the band Leather Canary, which included fellow student Chevy Chase on drums. At the time, Chase called the group &quot;a bad jazz band.&quot;

Becker left the school in 1969 before completing his degree and moved with Fagen to Brooklyn, where the two began to build a career as a songwriting duo. They were members of the touring band for Jay and the Americans but used the pseudonyms Gus Mahler (Becker) and Tristan Fabriani (Fagen). They composed music for the soundtrack to &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You&#x27;ll Lose That Beat&quot;, a 1971 film starring Zalman King.

==With Steely Dan (1971–1981)==

In 1971, Becker and Fagen moved to Los Angeles and were hired by Gary Katz as staff songwriters at ABC Records, later forming Steely Dan with guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, drummer Jim Hodder, and vocalist David Palmer. Fagen played keyboards and sang, while Becker played bass guitar. Steely Dan spent the next three years touring and recording before swearing off touring in 1974, confining themselves to the studio with personnel that changed for every album. In addition to co-writing all of the band&#x27;s material, Becker played guitar and bass guitar and sang background vocals.

&quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (1974) was the first Steely Dan album to feature Becker on guitar. &quot;Once I met [session musician] Chuck Rainey&quot;, he explained, &quot;I felt there really was no need for me to be bringing my bass guitar to the studio anymore&quot;.

Despite the success of &quot;Aja&quot; in 1977, Becker suffered from setbacks during this period, including an addiction to narcotics. After the duo returned to New York in 1978, Becker&#x27;s girlfriend Karen Roberta Stanley, who was an employee of ABC Dunhill Records and personal manager for the band, died of a drug overdose in his apartment on January 30, 1980, resulting in a wrongful death lawsuit against him. Soon after, he was hit by a cab in Manhattan while crossing the street and was forced to walk with crutches while recovering. His exhaustion was made worse by commercial pressure and the complicated recording of the album &quot;Gaucho&quot; (1980). Becker and Fagen suspended their partnership in June 1981.

==Work in record production (1981–1993)==
Following Steely Dan&#x27;s breakup, Becker and his family moved to Maui. Becker ceased using drugs, stopped smoking and drinking, and became an &quot;avocado rancher and self-styled critic of the contemporary scene.&quot;

He produced albums for the new wave bands Fra Lippo Lippi and China Crisis, and is credited on the latter&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection&quot; as a member of the band. He also produced albums for Michael Franks and John Beasley. Becker produced Rickie Lee Jones&#x27;s album &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot; (certified gold by the RIAA in 1997) and played bass on the title track. Becker and Fagen reunited in 1986 to collaborate on &quot;Zazu&quot;, the debut album by Rosie Vela. In 1991, Becker appeared in Fagen&#x27;s New York Rock and Soul Revue.

==Steely Dan reformation (1993–2017) ==

In 1993, Becker produced Fagen&#x27;s album &quot;Kamakiriad&quot;. A year later, Fagen co-produced Becker&#x27;s debut album &quot;11 Tracks of Whack&quot;.

Also in 1993, Steely Dan began touring for the first time in nineteen years, resulting in the 1995 release of their first live album, &quot;Alive in America&quot;, a compilation of live recordings from different American tour dates in 1993 and 1994.

In 2000 they released &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;, their first album of new material in twenty years. The album won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. In 2001 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received honorary doctorates from the Berklee College of Music, which they accepted in person. In 2003, they released the album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; with Becker singing lead vocal on &quot;Slang of Ages&quot;. They followed the album with a tour.

In 2005, Becker co-produced and played bass guitar on the album &quot;All One&quot; by Krishna Das and played guitar on the album &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; by Rebecca Pidgeon. He co-wrote &quot;I&#x27;m All Right&quot; from the album &quot;Half the Perfect World&quot; (2006) by Madeleine Peyroux, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do Me&quot; and the title track from her album &quot;Bare Bones&quot; (2009). See the &quot;Collaborations&quot; section below for a full list of Becker&#x27;s work with other artists.

He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2008.

His second solo album, &quot;Circus Money&quot;, was released on June 10, 2008, fourteen years after its predecessor. The songs were inspired by reggae and other styles of Jamaican music.

== Instruments and equipment ==
Becker was a collector of musical equipment, accumulating hundreds of guitars and amplifiers, as well as numerous other instruments, pedals, pre-wired pedalboards, &quot;speakers, recording gear, and ephemera.&quot; In concert, he often played custom-built guitars modeled after Stratocasters.

After his death, his gear was auctioned off by Julien&#x27;s for in total. Becker&#x27;s guitar and amp collection was the largest ever sold by Julien&#x27;s, whose owner said &quot;what made [the] collection unique&quot; was that Becker &quot;literally played all of them.&quot;

In a column for &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine published in 1994, Becker coined the acronym G.A.S. (&quot;Guitar Acquisition Syndrome&quot;), denoting the uncontrolled accumulation of music gear. The term was later adapted as Gear Acquisition Syndrome in online forums and music magazines.

==Personal life==
In 1975 Becker married Juanna Fatouros. In 1984 he married Elinor Roberta Meadows, a yoga teacher, and the couple had a son and an adopted daughter Sayan. They divorced in 1997. Becker wrote &quot;Little Kawai&quot; for his son, and it became the final song on &quot;11 Tracks of Whack&quot;.

==Illness and death==
In the spring of 2017, Becker was diagnosed with &quot;an aggressive form of esophageal cancer&quot; during an annual medical checkup. Despite vigorous treatment, the cancer rapidly worsened and Becker was unable to perform at Steely Dan&#x27;s concerts in the months that followed. He died from the disease on September 3, 2017, at the age of 67 at his home in Manhattan, New York City. At the time of his death, no cause or other details were announced, but a statement released in November by Becker&#x27;s widow, Delia Becker, detailed his struggle with the disease.

In a statement released to the media the day of Becker&#x27;s death, Fagen recalled his long-time friend and musical partner as &quot;smart as a whip, an excellent guitarist and a great songwriter,&quot; and closed by stating that he intended to &quot;keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.&quot;

Julian Lennon, Steve Lukather, John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats and other musicians made public statements mourning Becker&#x27;s death. Rickie Lee Jones, whose album &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot; was produced by Becker, recalled her long friendship with him in an editorial she wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

At a public ceremony on 28 October 2018, 72nd Drive at 112th Street, Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, was co-named &quot;Walter Becker Way&quot;.

<doc id="550558" wikidata="Q665944" url="?curid=550558" title="Paschal Triduum">
<text>The Paschal Triduum or Easter Triduum (Latin: &quot;Triduum Paschale&quot;), Holy Triduum (Latin: &quot;Triduum Sacrum&quot;), or the Three Days, is the period of three days that begins with the liturgy on the evening of Maundy Thursday, reaches its high point in the Easter Vigil, and closes with evening prayer on Easter Sunday. It is a moveable observance recalling the Passion, Crucifixion, Death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus, as portrayed in the canonical Gospels.

In the Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian and Reformed traditions, the Paschal Triduum straddles the two liturgical seasons of Lent and Easter in the Church calendar (Holy Saturday is the last day of Lent, with the Easter Vigil being the first liturgy of Eastertide). In the Roman Catholic tradition since the 1955 reform by Pope Pius XII, the Easter Triduum has been more clearly distinguished as a separate liturgical period. 

Previously, all these celebrations were advanced by more than twelve hours. The Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper and the Easter Vigil were celebrated on the morning of Thursday and Saturday respectively, and Holy Week and Lent were seen as ending only on the approach of Easter. In the Roman Rite, after the &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot; in the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, all church bells are silenced (sometimes replaced by a crotalus) and the organ is not used. This period that lasted from Thursday morning to before Easter Sunday began what was once referred to in Anglo-Saxon times as &quot;the still days&quot;. Weddings in the Catholic Church were once prohibited throughout Lent and certain other times of the year as well, and are still forbidden during the Triduum. Lutherans still discourage weddings during the entirety of Holy Week, inclusive of the Easter Triduum.

==Maundy Thursday (also called Holy Thursday)==

In some Protestant denominations, the Triduum begins with an evening worship service on Maundy Thursday.

In the Catholic Church and in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism, in the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, during the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, all church bells may be rung and the organ played; afterwards, bells and organ are silenced until the Gloria of the Easter Vigil. After the homily or sermon of the Mass, &quot;where a pastoral reason suggests it&quot;, a ritual washing of the feet follows. The Mass concludes with a procession of the Blessed Sacrament to the altar of repose. This is usually followed by the stripping of the altars. Eucharistic adoration is encouraged after this, but if continued after midnight should be done without outward solemnity.

In the form of the Roman Rite in use before 1965, Mass was celebrated in the morning. Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one&#x27;s Altar of Repose, a practice called Seven Churches Visitation, which may also be done on Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual stripping of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks. In the present form as revised in 1955, the altar is stripped bare without ceremony at some time after the evening Mass.

The liturgical colour for the Mass vestments and other ornaments is white in the Catholic and Anglican Churches. In the Lutheran Church, the liturgical colour for Maundy Thursday is white. In the Reformed tradition, white or gold may be used. In the United Methodist Church, black is used as the liturgical colour.

==Good Friday==

On Good Friday, Christians recall the passion and crucifixion of Jesus.

In the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglo-Catholic rites, a cross or crucifix (not necessarily the one that stands on or near the altar on other days of the year) is ceremonially unveiled. (In pre-1955 services, other crucifixes were to be unveiled, without ceremony, after the Good Friday service.) In the Catholic ritual, clergy traditionally begin the service prostrate in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord&#x27;s Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name &quot;Mass of the Presanctified&quot;. In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day. 

Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service. Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it.

Colors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no colour, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Missal the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, black vestments are sometimes used. In the United Methodist Church, black is the liturgical colour used on Good Friday. In the Lutheran churches, there is no liturgical color on Good Friday. Altars remain stripped and clergy wear no vestments on this day.

Moravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday. Communicants of the Moravian Church practice the Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries.

==Holy Saturday==

Also called Black Saturday, is a vigil service that is held after nightfall on Holy Saturday, or before dawn on Easter Sunday, in commemoration Jesus&#x27; death, sabbath rest, and harrowing of Hell. Many of the details that follow hold for Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches as well as Catholic worship. The ceremony of darkness and light is held at the beginning of the Easter Vigil Mass. The paschal candle, whose lighting symbolizes the resurrection of Christ from the dead, is lit from the new Easter fire. The solemn procession to the altar with the Paschal candle is formed. Once everyone has processed in, the Exsultet is intoned.

After the Exsultet, everyone is seated and listens to seven readings from the Old Testament and seven psalms and canticles. At least three of these readings and associated psalms and canticles must be read, which must include the account of the deliverance of the Israelites at the Red Sea from the Book of Exodus, a central event of the first Passover. Pastoral conditions are taken into account when deciding on the number of readings. These readings account salvation history, beginning with Creation. In Anglican worship, there are nine possible readings from the Old Testament, and a minimum of two must be read, which must include the account of Israel&#x27;s deliverance at the Red Sea.

In Catholic practice, during the Gloria at the Mass, the organ and church bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in two days. If the lights of the Church have been previously left off, they are turned on as the Gloria begins. The Paschal candle is used to bless the baptismal font to be used in the celebration of the sacrament. The Great Alleluia is sung before the Gospel is read, Alleluia being used for the first time since before Lent. People receiving full initiation in the Church, who have completed their training, are given the Sacraments of Christian initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist). In Catholic and Anglican tradition, the Easter Vigil is an especially appropriate day for Holy Baptism.

In current practice, the use of lighting to signify the emergence from sin and the resurrection of Jesus varies, from the use of candles held by parishioners as well as candelabra lit throughout the church. If statues and images have been veiled during the last two weeks of Lent, they are unveiled, without ceremony, before the Easter Vigil service begins. (In the 1962 Catholic missal and earlier missals, they are unveiled during the &quot;Gloria in Excelsis&quot; of the Easter Vigil Mass.)

Color of vestments and hangings: white, often together with gold, with yellow and white flowers often in use in many parishes.

Easter Masses are held throughout the day and are similar in content to the Easter Vigil Mass.

==Easter time==

The date of Easter varies from year to year. It occurs on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after 21 March, a date taken, in accordance with an ancient ecclesiastical tradition, to be that of the spring equinox, but which does not always correspond to the astronomical equinox. The Julian Calendar is taken as the basis of the calculations by nearly all Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches and is accepted even by Latin Church Catholics in countries such as Ethiopia and Greece. 

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Julian Calendar&#x27;s 21 March corresponds to 3 April in the Gregorian Calendar, the calendar used for civil purposes in most countries. The earliest possible date for Easter is 22 March, and the latest 25 April. These dates in the Julian Calendar now correspond to the Gregorian Calendar&#x27;s 4 April and 8 May.

During the Easter octave (and also during Holy Week) no other feast is celebrated. If Easter is very early, the solemnity of the Annunciation (25 March) may fall within the octave or Holy Week and is then transferred to the Monday after the octave.

The Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all feasts and solemnities, solemnities being then transferred to the following Monday, unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord&#x27;s Resurrection. &quot;The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holy day of Obligation, should it fall on Palm Sunday of the Lord&#x27;s Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, 18 March. Where, on the other hand, it is not observed as a Holy day of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of Bishops to another day outside Lent.&quot;

The solemnity of the Ascension is on the fortieth day of Easter, which is always a Thursday, although it may be observed on the following Sunday. Pentecost (or Whitsun) is the fiftieth day.

The Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday on the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and Protestant calendars. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar the octave of Pentecost is included in Eastertide, which thus ends at None of the following Ember Saturday.

During the 50-day Easter period, vestments are generally white or gold, but red when celebrating apostles and martyrs and on the solemnity of Pentecost. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar, with its 56-day Eastertide, red was used during the octave of Pentecost.

<text>The chart below represents the current enlisted rank insignia of the United States Air Force.


While all Air Force military personnel are referred to as &quot;airmen&quot;, it can specifically refer to the pay grades of E-1 through E-4, which are below the level of non-commissioned officers (NCOs). Above the pay grade of E-4 (E-5 through E-9) all ranks fall into the category of NCO and are further subdivided into &quot;NCOs&quot; (E-5 and E-6) and &quot;senior NCOs&quot; (E-7 through E-9); the term &quot;junior NCO&quot; is sometimes used to refer to staff sergeants and technical sergeants (E-5 and E-6).

The Air Force and Space Force are the only ones of the six branches of the United States military where NCO status is now only achieved at the grade of E-5. Formerly, the grade of sergeant was obtained after a time as a senior airman and successful completion of the Air Force NCO School. In all other branches, NCO status can be achieved at the grade of E-4 (a corporal in the Army and Marine Corps, petty officer third class in the Navy and Coast Guard). However, E-4s in the Army with the rank of specialist are not NCOs. The Air Force mirrored the Army from 1976 to 2 May 1991 with an E-4 being either a senior airman wearing three stripes without a star or a sergeant (informally referred to as a &quot;buck sergeant&quot;) which was noted by the presence of the central star and considered an NCO. Despite not being an NCO, a senior airman who has completed Airman Leadership School can be a supervisor.

==History==
Although the United States Air Force came into being as an independent uniformed service with the National Security Act of 1947, it initially retained the previously-used United States Army Air Forces’ rank structure and corresponding insignia. This rank structure provided for seven enlisted ranks: private, private first class, corporal/technician fifth grade, sergeant/technician fourth grade, staff sergeant/technician third grade, technical sergeant, and master sergeant/first sergeant. Additionally, Air Force personnel were still referred to as &quot;soldiers&quot;. During World War II, many USAAF NCOs wore the Army Air Corps branch insignia of the winged propeller underneath their chevrons.

Changes to the rank structure were proposed almost immediately after the creation of the Air Force, but did not start occurring until the next year. In late 1947 and early 1948, new chevron designs were tested at Bolling Air Force Base. The style preferred was the one used today, the inverted chevron. Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg approved the new chevron on 9 March 1948. A new Air Force &quot;Uxbridge blue&quot; uniform, silver-gray-on-blue-backing stripes, and black leather boots replaced the U.S. Army Air Corps&#x27; olive drab uniform, olive drab-on-dark-blue-backing stripes, and russet leather boots in 1949. Old russet leather gear items like boots and holsters were re-dyed and polished black. Air Force personnel were allowed to wear their old World War II-pattern uniforms and rank insignia until July 1952. Recolored Army service stripes and overseas service bars were worn on the uniform until 1957.

Although the new chevrons were approved, the titles did not change. Two years passed before General Vandenberg, in February 1950, ordered all enlisted personnel in the Air Force be referred to as &quot;airman&quot; (singular) and &quot;airmen&quot; (plural) rather than &quot;soldiers&quot;. A further two years would go by while the enlisted rank structure was studied and changes proposed. The end results finally became effective on 24 April 1952 with the release of a revised Air Force Regulation (AFR) 39–36. This revision changed the names of the enlisted ranks to basic airman, airman third class, airman second class, airman first class (with resultant loss of NCO status that was not restored until 1967), staff sergeant, technical sergeant and master sergeant.

With the new titles came a proposal for new rank insignia for airman third class through airman first class. The proposed insignia had horizontal stripes for airman third class through airman first class while NCOs kept their inverted chevrons. The purpose of the two different types of insignia was to more readily differentiate the airman and NCO tiers while increasing the prestige of the latter. These were not approved at the time of the release of the revised regulation. When they were finally approved by General Vandenberg in December 1952, procurement of these stripes was deferred until approximately June 1955. This change was eventually reversed, on 12 March 1956, by General Vandenberg&#x27;s successor, General Twining. On 20 September 2021, the United States Space Force released several media graphics depicting the new rank insignia for enlisted personnel. The information sheets described the designs for the enlisted ranks took inspiration from Vandenberg&#x27;s proposals from 1952, noted as &quot;Vandenberg Stripes&quot;.

During his tenure, General Twining also approved the diamond insignia for first sergeants. This became available on 21 September 1955. With this approval, the foundations of the first seven ranks and insignia the Air Force uses today were in place.

The next major change came with the Military Pay Act of 1958. This established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 but without corresponding rank titles. The titles of senior master sergeant and chief master sergeant were chosen between July and December 1958 after comments were solicited from the major Air Force commands of the day. After much discussion, the insignia for these two ranks were designed by simply adding one and two chevrons to the top of the master sergeant insignia (for E-8 and E-9 respectively), each stripe pointing up.

The rank of basic airman was renamed to airman basic on 5 February 1959, still with no insignia attached.

The next series of changes to Air Force enlisted ranks did not occur for almost eight years. In January 1967 the position of Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force was created. This position gained its own special insignia, the chief master sergeant chevrons with a wreath encircling the center star. On 1 August 1967 the lower enlisted rank names changed (revised AFR 39–36 on 19 October 1967) renamed to airman third class, airman second class and airman first class to airman, airman first class and sergeant (known unofficially as &quot;buck sergeant&quot; by the NCO ranks at the time) respectively. This returned sergeant to the rank structure as the first step in the NCO tier as a retention move but required achievement of a 5-skill Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) level. No changes to the respective insignias were made.

In a 30 December 1975, directive the grade of sergeant was split into two separate ranks while retaining the grade of E-4. Senior airman was the last junior enlisted tier rank while sergeant remained the first rank in the NCO tier. The impetus behind this was to laterally promote senior E-4 airmen who were ready for NCO responsibilities but not prepared to take on the role of a staff sergeant. This permitted airmen who had not yet reached the AFSC 5-skill level to achieve the pay grade of E-4. To differentiate the two ranks, the directive changed the silver star in the center of airman, airman first class and senior airman changed to blue while the star on sergeant chevrons remained silver. Having two ranks within one grade mirrored the Army&#x27;s specialist/corporal division of E-4. This dual role lasted until March 1991, when then Chief of Staff General McPeak terminated the rank of sergeant effective 2 May 1991. This termination was due in part to the manning reductions that occurred in the post–Cold War drawdowns of the early 1990s. The last of the &quot;buck sergeants&quot; would have either been promoted or discharged under High Year Tenure by December 1998.

The year 1991 also saw the last major change to the enlisted rank insignia. In October 1991 General McPeak and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Pfingston announced that the senior NCO tier would have new chevron layouts and that all chevrons would have a white star in the center. The change in senior NCO chevrons was the first since chevrons came into being in 1948. Until that time, master sergeant had been composed of six inverted chevrons (six down) with none pointing up, senior master sergeant six down with one up and chief master sergeant six down with two up. The new layout changed the insignia to the current layout (see chart above). The second change, changing the star color to white, was actually two changes in one. It added a star to the airman through senior airman rank insignias where there had been none since 1 June 1976 (the blue star carried by these chevrons was the same color as the blue in the stripes giving the impression that the star was not there) and changing the silver star on the NCO and senior NCO chevrons to white.

In November 1998, the duty position of senior enlisted advisor was changed to command chief master sergeant. Along with the change, the addition of a star in the empty blue area between the chevrons was added to denote those holding this position.

In November 2004, the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force insignia was updated to include the Great Seal of the United States with a white star on either side. These additions were placed in the empty blue area between the chevrons.

In December 2019, the duty position of senior enlisted advisor to the chairman (SEAC) was given a unique rank insignia. Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Ramon Colon-Lopez, the fourth senior enlisted advisor to the chairman, is to be the first to wear the new Air Force version of the insignia.

==Timeline of changes==
This table shows changes in insignia, from 1947 until the present.

==Civil Air Patrol==
Former military enlisted personnel from E-4 up may choose to retain their grade as senior members in the Civil Air Patrol, with grades E-5 (CAP staff sergeant) through E-9 (CAP chief master sergeant) available. Former CAP national commander, Major Gen Carr, unveiled plans to restructure the CAP NCO program to allow individuals to &quot;enlist&quot; as NCOs and progress through a specific professional development program. According to an air force article on the subject, &quot;The current design of the NCO corps in the CAP only allows former active-duty NCOs to be a part of the corps, with no upgrade training for promotion within the ranks. The newly signed corps structure will mirror the Air Force NCO force structure with an established process to promote and develop NCOs.&quot; By 2018 a professional development and promotion pathway was in place for former military enlisted personnel who joined CAP at their previous rank.

<text>The third USS &quot;Farragut&quot; (DD-348) was named for Admiral David Glasgow Farragut (1801–1870). She was the lead ship of her class of destroyers in the United States Navy.

==History==
&quot;Farragut&quot; was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 20 September 1932, launched on 15 March 1934 by Mrs. James Roosevelt, daughter-in-law of the President, and commissioned on 18 June 1934, with Commander Elliott Buckmaster in command.

Because it was nearly 14 years since a new destroyer had been commissioned in the U.S. Navy, &quot;Farragut&quot; devoted much of her early service to developmental operations, cruising out of her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, to the Caribbean and along the east coast. On 26 March 1935, she embarked with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Jacksonville, Florida, and the next day carried him to a rendezvous with a private yacht. Farragut escorted the President&#x27;s yacht on a cruise to the Bahamas; on 7 April he embarked on her for passage to Jacksonville, where he left the ship on 8 April 1935.

&quot;Farragut&quot; sailed for San Diego, California, arriving there on 19 April 1935 to join Destroyer Squadron 20 as flagship. Fleet maneuvers on the west coast, training operations in the Hawaiian Islands, and cruises during the summer to train men of the Naval Reserve in Alaskan waters continued until 3 January 1939. &quot;Farragut&quot; then sailed for fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean, returning to San Diego on 12 April. From 2 October she was based at Pearl Harbor, and made two voyages to the west coast to screen carriers to Pearl Harbor. From 1 August 1941, Farragut was usually at sea for exercises with carrier task forces.

==World War II==
&quot;Farragut&quot; was berthed in a nest of destroyers in East Loch, Pearl Harbor, at the time of the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. Ensign James Armen Benham, her engineering officer and senior on board at the time, got her underway, and as she sailed down the channel, she kept up a steady fire. For his action, Ensign Benham was awarded the Bronze Star. Through March 1942, &quot;Farragut&quot; operated in Hawaiian waters, and from Oahu to San Francisco, California, on anti-submarine patrols and escort duty.

On 15 April 1942, &quot;Farragut&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor with the task force, bound for the Coral Sea and a rendezvous with the task force. Together these forces engaged Japanese forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea from 4 to 8 May 1942. For the first 2 days of the battle, &quot;Farragut&quot; sailed with the Attack Force, while the aircraft carriers in another group launched air strikes on Tulagi. On 6 May, all ships were united as TF 17, and sailed to the northwestward to make contact with the Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Group. Next day, &quot;Farragut&quot; was detached in the Support Group assigned to continue the search for the Japanese invasion forces. &quot;Farragut&#x27;s&quot; group came under heavy air attack that afternoon, but downed at least five aircraft, and received no damage to any ship.

&quot;Farragut&quot; arrived at Cid Harbor, Australia, 11 May 1942, and until returning to Pearl Harbor 29 June, called at Brisbane, Nouméa, Suva, Tongatapu, and Auckland while on escort duty. She next sortied from Pearl Harbor 7 July 1942, in the task force, bound for action in the Solomon Islands. She served as screening ship and plane guard during the air operations covering the assault on Guadalcanal 7 August, and then patrolled the eastern Solomons to protect sea lanes to Guadalcanal. On 24 and 25 August, the carrier she guarded engaged Japanese forces in the air Battle of the Eastern Solomons.

The destroyer remained in the southwest Pacific, patrolling off Guadalcanal to guard unloading transports, and escorting convoys from Australia to Espiritu Santo, Nouméa, and the Fiji Islands. She returned to Pearl Harbor 27 January 1943, and after a west coast overhaul and training, arrived at Adak 16 April. She patrolled Alaskan waters until 11 May, when she screened transports landing troops on Adak from submarine attack. Next day she made several depth charge attacks on an enemy submarine and she continued anti-submarine patrol off the Aleutian Islands through June. &quot;Farragut&quot; patrolled and blockaded off Kiska from 5 July, joining in the bombardment of the island many times in the days before the landings of 15 August. She continued to protect the troops ashore at Kiska until 4 September, when she left Adak in convoy for San Francisco and a brief overhaul.

&quot;Farragut&quot; put to sea, from San Diego 19 October 1943, bound for training in the Hawaiian Islands and at Espiritu Santo. Again guarding carriers, she took part in the air operations covering the landings on Tarawa 20 November, and screened the carriers until the task force shaped course for Pearl Harbor 8 December. The destroyer continued on to the west coast for a brief repair period and training, sailing from San Diego 13 January 1944 for action in the Marshall Islands. During the assaults on Kwajalein and Eniwetok, she screened carriers, patrolled, and conducted anti-submarine searches, then sailed for air strikes on Woleai and Wakde. Late in April, she was off New Guinea as the carriers supported the landings in the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area, and through May joined in training operations out of Majuro.

From her arrival off Saipan 11 June 1944, &quot;Farragut&quot; guarded the carriers covering the landings of 15 June, bombarded the shores of Saipan and Guam, and served as radar picket through the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. &quot;Farragut&quot; sailed to replenish at Eniwetok 28 June to 14 July. On 17 and 18 July, she closed the beach at Agat, Guam, to provide covering fire for underwater demolition teams preparing for the assault on the island. After screening a cruiser to Saipan she returned to Guam 21 July to patrol seaward of the Fire Support Group covering the assault landings. On 25 July, she joined in the bombardment of Rota, and 5 days later cleared for overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard.

&quot;Farragut&quot; arrived at Ulithi 21 November 1944, and sailed 4 days later to screen a group of oilers serving the fast carrier task force as it sent strikes against Taiwan and Luzon in preparation for the assault on Lingayen. Based on Ulithi, she served with this group as it supported the carriers in their operations of the Iwo Jima and Okinawa invasions, then from 25 to 28 April 1945 served on carrier screening duty for air operations on islands of the Ryukyus not yet invaded. From 11 May to 6 August, she escorted convoys between Ulithi and Okinawa, and during the last 2 weeks of May, served on radar picket duty at Okinawa.

==Fate==
The destroyer was homeward bound from Saipan 21 August 1945, arriving at the Brooklyn Navy Yard 25 September. &quot;Farragut&quot; was decommissioned on 23 October 1945, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 January 1947 and sold for scrap on 14 August 1947.

&quot;Farragut&quot; received 14 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Varlam Tikhonovich Shalamov (; 18 June 1907 – 17 January 1982), baptized as Varlaam, was a Russian writer, journalist, poet and Gulag survivor. He spent much of the period from 1937 to 1951 imprisoned in forced-labor camps in the Arctic region of Kolyma, due in part to his support of Leon Trotsky and praise of writer Ivan Bunin. In 1946, near death, he became a medical assistant while still a prisoner. He remained in that role for the duration of his sentence, then for another two years after being released, until 1953.

From 1954 to 1978, he wrote a set of short stories about his experiences in the labor camps, which were collected and published in six volumes, collectively known as &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot;. These books were initially published in the West, in English translation, starting in the 1960s; they were eventually published in the original Russian, but only became officially available in the Soviet Union in 1987, in the post-glasnost era. &quot;The Kolyma Tales&quot; are considered Shalamov&#x27;s masterpiece, and &quot;the definitive chronicle&quot; of life in the labor camps.

== Early life ==

Varlam Shalamov was born in Vologda, Vologda Governorate, a Russian city with a rich culture famous for its wooden architecture, to the family of a hereditary Russian Orthodox priest and teacher, Father Tikhon Nikolayevich Shalamov, a graduate of the . At first young Shalamov was named and baptized after the patron of Vologda, Saint Varlaam of Khutyn (1157–1210); Shalamov later changed his name to the more common Varlam. Shalamov&#x27;s mother, Nadezhda (Nadia) Aleksandrovna, was a teacher as well. She also enjoyed poetry, and Varlam speculated that she could have become a poet if not for her family. His father worked as a missionary in Alaska for 12 years from 1892, and Varlam&#x27;s older brother, Sergei, grew up there (he volunteered for World War I and was killed in action in 1917); they returned as events were heating up in Russia by 1905. In 1914, Varlam entered the gymnasium of St. Alexander&#x27;s and graduated in 1923. Although he was a son of a priest, he used to say that he lost faith and became an atheist at the age of 13. His father was of very progressive views and even supported the October Revolution in a way.

Upon his graduation it became clear that the Regional Department of People&#x27;s Education (RONO, &quot;Regionalnoe Otdelenie Narodnogo Obrazovania&quot;) would not support his further education because Varlam was a son of a priest. Therefore, he found a job as a tanner at the leather factory in the settlement of Kuntsevo (a suburb of Moscow, since 1960 part of the Moscow city). In 1926, after having worked for two years, he was accepted into the department of Soviet Law at Moscow State University through open competition. While studying there Varlam was intrigued by the oratory skills displayed during the debates between Anatoly Lunacharsky and Metropolitan Alexander Vvedensky. At that time Shalamov was convinced that he would become a literature specialist. His literary tastes included Modernist literature (later, he would say that he considered his teachers not Tolstoy, of whom he was very critical, or other classic writers, but Andrei Bely and Aleksey Remizov) and classic poetry. His favorite poets were Alexander Pushkin and Boris Pasternak, whose works influenced him his entire life. He also praised Dostoevsky, Savinkov, Joyce and Hemingway, about whom he later wrote a long essay depicting the myriad possibilities of artistic endeavors.

==First imprisonment, 1929–1932==

Shalamov joined a Trotskyist-leaning group and on February 19, 1929, was arrested and sent to Butyrskaya prison for solitary confinement. He was later sentenced to three years of correctional labor in the town of Vizhaikha, convicted of distributing the &quot;Letters to the Party Congress&quot; known as Lenin&#x27;s Testament, which were critical of Joseph Stalin, and of participating in a demonstration marking the tenth anniversary of the Soviet revolution with the slogan &quot;Down with Stalin&quot;. Courageously he refused to sign the sentence branding him a criminal. Later, he would write in his short stories that he was proud of having continued the Russian revolutionary tradition of members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and Narodnaya Volya, who were fighting against tsarism. He was taken by train to the former Solikamsk monastery, which was transformed into a militsiya headquarters of the Vishera department of Solovki ITL}

Shalamov was released in 1931 and worked in the new town of Berezniki, Perm Oblast, at the local chemical plant construction site. He was given the opportunity to travel to Kolyma for colonization. Sarcastically, Shalamov said that he would go there only under enforced escort. Coincidentally, fate would hold him to his promise several years later. He returned to Moscow in 1932, where he worked as a journalist and managed to see some of his essays and articles published, including his first short story, &quot;The three deaths of Doctor Austino&quot; (1936).

==Second imprisonment, 1937–1942==

At the outset of the Great Purge, on January 12, 1937, Shalamov was arrested again for &quot;counter-revolutionary Trotskyist activities&quot; and sent to Kolyma, also known as &quot;the land of white death&quot;, for five years. He was already in jail awaiting sentencing when one of his short stories was published in the literary journal &quot;Literary Contemporary&quot;.

==Third imprisonment, 1943–1951==
In 1943, Shalamov was sentenced to another term, this time for 10 years, under Article 58 (anti-Soviet agitation), in part, for having called Nobelist Ivan Bunin a &quot;great Russian writer&quot;. The conditions he endured were extreme, first in gold mining operations, and then in coal mining. He was repeatedly sent to punishment zones, both for his political crimes and for his attempt to escape. There he managed to survive while sick with typhus, of which Shalamov was not aware until he became well. At that time, as he recollects in his writings, he did not care much about his survival.

In 1946, while becoming a &quot;dokhodyaga&quot; (one in an emaciated and devitalized state, which in Russian literally means one who is walking towards the ultimate end), his life was saved by a doctor-inmate, A. I. Pantyukhov, who risked his own life to get Shalamov a place as a camp hospital attendant. The new career allowed Shalamov to survive and concentrate on writing poetry.

==After release==
In 1951, Shalamov was released from the camp, and continued working as a medical assistant for the forced labor camps of Sevvostlag while still writing. After his release, he was faced with the dissolution of his former family, including a grown-up daughter who now refused to recognize her father. In 1952, Shalamov sent his poetry to Boris Pasternak, who praised his work. Shalamov was allowed to leave Magadan in November 1953 following Stalin&#x27;s death in March of that year, and was permitted to go to the village of Turkmen in Kalinin Oblast, near Moscow, where he worked as a supply agent.

==&quot;Kolyma Tales&quot;==
From 1954 to 1973, Shalamov worked on his book of short stories of labour camp life, &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot;. During the Khrushchev thaw, many inmates were released from the Gulag and politically rehabilitated. Some were rehabilitated posthumously. Shalamov was allowed to return to Moscow after having been officially exonerated (&quot;rehabilitated&quot;) in 1956. In 1957, he became a correspondent for the literary journal &quot;Moskva&quot;, and his poetry began to be published. His health, however, had been broken by his years in the camps, and he received a disability pension.

Shalamov proceeded to publish poetry and essays in the major Soviet literary magazines while writing his magnum opus, &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot;. He was acquainted with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Boris Pasternak, and Nadezhda Mandelstam. The manuscripts of &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot; were smuggled abroad and distributed via &quot;samizdat&quot;. The translations were published in the West in 1966. The complete Russian-language edition was published in London in 1978, and reprinted thereafter both in Russian and in translation. As the Soviet scholar David Satter writes, &quot;Shalamov&#x27;s short stories are the definitive chronicle of those camps&quot;. &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot; is considered to be one of the great Russian collections of short stories of the twentieth century.

Late in life, Shalamov got on bad terms with Solzhenitsyn and other fellow dissidents, and opposed the publication of his own works abroad.

Gospodin Solzhenitsyn, I willingly accept Your funeral joke on the account of my death. With the feeling of honor and pride I consider myself the first Cold War victim which have fallen from Your hand … – From the undispatched letter of V. T. Shalamov to A. I. Solzhenitsyn 

Shalamov also wrote a series of autobiographical essays that vividly bring to life the city of Vologda and his life before prison.

==Last years==

As his health deteriorated, he spent the last three years of his life in a house for elderly and disabled writers operated by Litfond (Union of Soviet Writers) in Tushino. The quality of this nursing home can be judged from the memoirs of Yelena Zakharova, who was introduced to Shalamov by her father, who had translated some of his works, and was close to Shalamov in the last six months of his life:

Despite his impairments, he continued to compose poems, which were written down and published by . Following a cursory examination, it was determined that he should be transferred to a psychiatric facility. On the way there, he became ill and contracted pneumonia. Shalamov died on January 17, 1982, and, despite having been an atheist, was given an Orthodox funeral ceremony (at the insistence of his friend, Zakharova) and was interred at Kuntsevo Cemetery, Moscow. The historian Valery Yesipov wrote that only forty people attended Shalamov&#x27;s funeral, not counting plainclothes policemen.

&quot;Kolyma Tales&quot; was finally published on Russian soil in 1987, as a result of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost policy.

Varlam Tikhonovich Shalamov was rehabilitated in the Soviet Union on July 18, 1956 by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union.

==Legacy==

In 1991, the Shalamov family house in Vologda, next to the town&#x27;s cathedral, was turned into the Shalamov Memorial Museum and local art gallery. The cathedral hill in Vologda has been named in his memory.

One of the Kolyma short stories, &quot;The Final Battle of Major Pugachoff&quot;, was made into a film () in 2005. In 2007, Russian Television produced the series &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Testament&quot;(Завещание Ленина), based on &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot;.
A minor planet 3408 Shalamov discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977 is named after him. A memorial to Shalamov was erected in Krasnovishersk in June 2007, the site of his first labor camp.

Shalamov&#x27;s friend, Fedot Fedotovich Suchkov, erected a monument on the burial plot, which was destroyed by unknown vandals in 2001. The criminal case was closed as uncompleted. With the help of some workers from &quot;SeverStal&quot; the monument was reestablished in 2001.

A few of Shalamov&#x27;s poems were set to music and performed as songs.

<text>Russell Earl Banks (March 28, 1940 – January 8, 2023) was an American writer of fiction and poetry. His novels are known for &quot;detailed accounts of domestic strife and the daily struggles of ordinary often-marginalized characters&quot;. He drew from his own childhood in the working class, but also from the larger world, such as his years in Jamaica. His novels often reflect &quot;moral themes and personal relationships&quot;.

Banks was a member of the International Parliament of Writers and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Life and career ==
Russell Earl Banks was born in Newton, Massachusetts, on March 28, 1940, and grew up &quot;in relative poverty.&quot; He was the son of Florence (née Taylor), a homemaker, and Earl Banks, a plumber, and was raised in Barnstead, New Hampshire. His father deserted the family when Banks was aged 12, making their survival even more difficult. 

Awarded a scholarship to attend Colgate University, Banks dropped out six weeks into university and traveled south instead, with the &quot;intention of joining Fidel Castro&#x27;s insurgent army in Cuba, but wound up working in a department store in Lakeland, Florida&quot;. 

He married Darlene Bennett, who was working as a sales clerk at the time. They had one daughter and later divorced.

According to an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, he started to write when he was living in Miami in the late 1950s. In a separate interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, he said the writing came after his return to New England in 1964 and settling in Boston. He married Mary Gunst. They had three daughters together before getting divorced in 1977.

Supportive of his writing, the Gunst family paid for him to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during their early marriage; he graduated in 1967. In Chapel Hill, Banks was involved in Students for a Democratic Society and protest during the Civil Rights Movement. 

In 1976, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. 

Several years after his divorce, Banks married Kathy Walton, an editor at Harper &amp; Row, in 1982. They divorced in 1988. The following year, he married poet Chase Twichell. They were married until his death in 2023.

He taught creative writing at Princeton University. At retirement, he was the Howard G.B. Clark ’21 University Professor in the Humanities, Emeritus, and professor of the Humanities Council and creative writing, emeritus.

He was also Artist-in-Residence at the University of Maryland. 

In popular culture, Banks&#x27;s work became more widely known through adaptations of several of his novels as films, among them &quot;Continental Drift&quot;.

He was briefly mentioned in philosopher Richard Rorty&#x27;s 1996 future history essay &quot;Fraternity Reigns&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. Rorty referred to him as having written a 2021 novel, &quot;Trampling the Vineyards&quot;, describing it as &quot;samizdat&quot; because of the political repression envisioned in the philosopher&#x27;s speculative essay.

Banks lived in upstate New York and Miami.

Banks&#x27;s works received high recognition through his careeer. He was the 1985 recipient of the John Dos Passos Prize for fiction. His novels &quot;Continental Drift&quot; and &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; were finalists for the 1986 and 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, respectively. 

Banks was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996.

He was a New York State Author for 2004–2006. 

===Death===
Banks died from cancer at his home in Saratoga Springs, New York, on Sunday, January 8, 2023, at the age of 82.

==Works and themes==
His work has been translated into twenty languages and has received numerous international prizes and awards. He wrote fiction, and, later, non-fiction, with &quot;Dreaming up America&quot;. His main works include the novels &quot;Continental Drift&quot;, &quot;Rule of the Bone&quot;, &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot;, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, and &quot;Affliction&quot;. The latter two novels were each made into feature films in 1997 (see &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; and &quot;Affliction&quot;).
Many of Banks&#x27;s works reflect his working-class upbringing. His stories often show people facing tragedy and downturns in everyday life, expressing sadness and self-doubt, but also showing resilience and strength in the face of their difficulties. Banks also wrote short stories, some of which appear in the collection &quot;The Angel on the Roof&quot;, as well as poetry.

Banks also lived in Jamaica. Interviewed in 1998 for &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, he stated that:
The themes of &quot;Continental Drift&quot; (1985) include globalization and unrest in Haiti. His 2004 novel &quot;The Darling&quot; is largely set in Liberia and deals with the racial and political experience of the white American narrator.

Writing in the &quot;Journal of American Studies&quot;, Anthony Hutchison argues that, &quot;[a]side from William Faulkner it is difficult to think of a white twentieth-century American writer who has negotiated the issue of race in as sustained, unflinching and intelligent a fashion as Russell Banks&quot;.

In 2023, it was confirmed that Paul Schrader would write and direct &quot;Oh, Canada&quot;, an adaptation of Banks&#x27;s novel, &quot;Foregone&quot;, starring Richard Gere and Jacob Elordi.

===Reception===
According to Robert Faggen in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, Banks&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Family Life&quot;, &quot;was not a critical success&quot;. His next volume, a collection of short stories called &quot;Searching for Survivors&quot;, won Banks an O. Henry Award. A second collection of short stories, &quot;The New World&quot;, published in 1978, &quot;received acclaim for its blending of historical and semi-autobiographical material&quot;.

Many have admired Banks&#x27;s realistic writing, which often explores American social dilemmas and moral struggles. Reviewers have appreciated his portrayal of the working-class people struggling to overcome destructive relationships, poverty, drug abuse, and spiritual confusion. Scholars have variously compared his fiction to the works of Raymond Carver, Richard Ford, and Andre Dubus. Christine Benvenuto commented that &quot;Banks writes with an intensely focused empathy and a compassionate sense of humor that help to keep readers, if not his characters, afloat through the misadventures and outright tragedies of his books.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Tom Cox selected &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; as one of his &quot;overlooked classics of American literature&quot;.

<text>David Lockwood (9 April 1929 – 6 June 2014) was a British sociologist.

== Early life ==
Lockwood was born on 9 April 1929 in Holmfirth, England, and was the youngest child in his working-class family. His father, Herbert, was a dyer and then retrained as a cobbler after being wounded during the First World War and he died when Lockwood was 10. His mother, Edith, was a cleaner. He served in the Army Intelligence Corps from 1947 to 1949.

== Life and works ==
His book, &quot;The Blackcoated Worker&quot; (1958 &amp; 1989), seeks to analyse the changes in the stratification position of the clerical worker by using a framework based on Max Weber&#x27;s distinction between market and work situations. Lockwood argued that the class position of any occupation can be most successfully located by distinguishing between the material rewards gained from the market and work situations, and those symbolic rewards deriving from its status situation. His work became a very important contribution to the &quot;proletarianisation&quot; debate which argued that many white-collar workers were beginning to identify with manual workers by identifying their work situation as having much in common with the proletariat.

Other published work included &quot;The Affluent Worker in the Class Structure&quot; (1969) and &quot;Solidarity and Schism&quot; (1992).

== Family life ==
Lockwood was married to the gender studies pioneer Leonore Davidoff, whom he met while studying at LSE. They had three sons: Matthew, Ben, and Harold.

Lockwood died on 6 June 2014.

<doc id="550602" wikidata="Q1207630" url="?curid=550602" title="Dharmapala">
<text>A dharmapāla is a type of wrathful god in Buddhism. The name means &quot;&quot;dharma&quot; protector&quot; in Sanskrit, and the &quot;dharmapālas&quot; are also known as the Defenders of the Justice (Dharma), or the Guardians of the Law. There are two kinds of &quot;dharmapala&quot;, Worldly Guardians (&quot;lokapala&quot;) and Wisdom Protectors (&quot;jnanapala&quot;). Only Wisdom Protectors are enlightened beings.

== Description ==
A protector of Buddhist dharma is called a &quot;dharmapala&quot;. They are typically wrathful deities, depicted with terrifying iconography in the Mahayana and tantric traditions of Buddhism. The wrathfulness is intended to depict their willingness to defend and guard Buddhist followers from dangers and enemies. The &quot;Aṣṭagatyaḥ&quot; (the eight kinds of nonhuman beings) is one category of &quot;dharmapālas&quot;, which includes the Garuda, Deva, Naga, Yaksha, Gandharva, Asura, Kinnara, and Mahoraga.

In Vajrayana iconography and thangka depictions, &quot;dharmapala&quot; are fearsome beings, often with many heads, many hands, or many feet. &quot;Dharmapala&quot; often have blue, black, or red skin, and a fierce expression with protruding fangs. Although &quot;dharmapala&quot; have a terrifying appearance, they only act in a wrathful way for the benefit of sentient beings.

The devotional worship of &quot;dharmapālas&quot; in the Tibetan tradition is traceable to early 8th-century.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

There are many different &quot;dharmapalas&quot; in Tibetan Buddhism. Each school has its own principle &quot;dharmapalas&quot; and most monasteries have a dedicated &quot;dharmapāla&quot; which was originally comparable to a genius loci. The many forms of Mahakala are emanations of Avalokiteshvara. Kalarupa and Yamantaka are considered by practitioners to be emanations of Manjushri the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.

Principal wisdom protector &quot;dharmapalas&quot; include:
* Prana Atma (Tib. &quot;Begtse&quot;)
* Ekajaṭī (Tib. &quot;ral chig ma&quot;)
* Mahakala (Tib. &quot;Nagpo Chenpo&quot;)
* Shri Devi (Tib. Palden Lhamo)
* Yamaraja/Dharmaraja/Kalarupa (Tib. &quot;Shinje&quot;)

Other &quot;dharmapalas&quot; include:
* Bhairava (Nepali: भैरव)
* Citipati
* Mahakali
* Yamantaka (Tib. &quot;Shinje Shed&quot;)
* Hayagriva (Tib. &quot;Tamdrin&quot;)
* Vaisravana (Tib. &quot;Kubera&quot;)
* Rāhula (Tib. &quot;gza&quot;)
* Vajrasādhu (Tib. &quot;Dorje Legpa&quot;)
* Brahma (Tib. &quot;Tshangs Pa&quot;) 
* Maharakta (Tib. &quot;tsog gi dag po, mar chen&quot;)
* Kurukulla (Tib. &quot; rig che ma&quot;)
* Vajrayakṣa (Takkiraja) (Tib. &quot;du pai gyal po&quot;)

The main functions of a &quot;dharmapāla&quot; are said to be to avert the inner and outer obstacles that prevent spiritual practitioners from attaining spiritual realizations, as well as to foster the necessary conditions for their practice.

=== Chinese Buddhism ===
In Chinese Buddhism, the Twenty-Four Protective Deities or the Twenty-Four Devas (Chinese: 二十四諸天; pinyin: &quot;Èrshísì Zhūtiān&quot;) are a group of gods who are venerated as &quot;dharmapālas.&quot; In addition, Wisdom Kings such as Acala, Ucchusma, Mahamayuri, and Hayagriva are venerated as &quot;dharmapālas&quot; as well.

===Shingon Buddhism===
In Japanese Shingon Buddhism, a descendant of Tangmi, or Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, &quot;dharmapālas&quot; such as Acala and Yamantaka are classified as Wisdom Kings. Other &quot;dharmapālas&quot;, notably Mahakala, belong to the Deva realm, the fourth and lowest class in the hierarchy of honorable beings.

== Related deities ==
In Tibetan Buddhism, there are two other classes of defender, the lokapālas and Kshetrapala Papiya. Guan Yu and Hachiman are also known as defenders.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting was presented from 1991 to 2006 for a distinguished example of beat reporting characterized by sustained and knowledgeable coverage of a particular subject or activity.

From 1985 to 1990 it was known as the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Specialized Reporting.

For 2007, the category was dropped in favor of a Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, with the Pulitzer Prize Board noting that &quot;the work of beat reporters remains eligible for entry in a wide range of categories that include—depending on the specialty involved—national, investigative, and explanatory reporting, as well as the new local category.&quot;

==Pulitzer Prize for Specialized Reporting==
*1985: Randall Savage and Jackie Crosby of the &quot;Macon Telegraph and News&quot;, for their in-depth examination of academics and athletics at the University of Georgia and the Georgia Institute of Technology.
*1986: Andrew Schneider and Mary Pat Flaherty of &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, for their investigation of violations and failures in the organ transplantation system in the United States.
*1987: Alex S. Jones of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for &quot;The Fall of the House of Bingham&quot;, a skillful and sensitive report of a powerful newspaper family&#x27;s bickering and how it led to the sale of a famed media empire.
*1988: Walt Bogdanich of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, for his chilling series of reports on faulty testing by American medical laboratories.
*1989: Edward Humes of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, for his in-depth reporting on the military establishment in Southern California.
*1990: Tamar Stieber of &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;, For persistent reporting that linked a rare blood disorder to an over-the-counter dietary supplement, L-Tryptophan, and led to a national recall of the product.

* 1991: Natalie Angier, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for her compelling and illuminating reports on a variety of scientific topics.
* 1992: Deborah Blum, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, for her series, &quot;The Monkey Wars,&quot; which explored the complex ethical and moral questions surrounding primate research.
* 1993: Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, for often exclusive coverage of General Motors&#x27; management turmoil.
* 1994: Eric Freedman and Jim Mitzelfeld, &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, for dogged reporting that disclosed flagrant spending abuses at Michigan&#x27;s House Fiscal Agency.
* 1995: David Shribman, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, for his analytical reporting on Washington developments and the national scene.

* 1998: Linda Greenhouse, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for her consistently illuminating coverage of the United States Supreme Court.
* 1999: Chuck Philips and Michael A. Hiltzik, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, for their stories on corruption in the entertainment industry, including a charity sham sponsored by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, illegal detoxification programs for wealthy celebrities, and a resurgence of radio payola.

* 2001: David Cay Johnston, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for his penetrating and enterprising reporting that exposed loopholes and inequities in the U.S. tax code, which was instrumental in bringing about reforms.
* 2002: Gretchen Morgenson, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for her trenchant and incisive Wall Street coverage.
* 2003: Diana K. Sugg, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, for her absorbing, often poignant stories that illuminated complex medical issues through the lives of people.

<text>Kamehameha Schools, formerly called Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate (KSBE), is a private school system in Hawaii established by the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, under the terms of the will of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, who was a formal member of the House of Kamehameha. Bishop&#x27;s will established a trust called the &quot;Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate&quot; that is Hawaii&#x27;s largest private landowner. Originally established in 1887 as an all-boys school for native Hawaiian children, it shared its grounds with the Bishop Museum. After it moved to another location, the museum took over two school halls. Kamehameha Schools opened its girls&#x27; school in 1894. It became coeducational in 1965. The Kapālama campus opened in 1931, while the Maui and Hawaii campuses opened in 1996 and 2001, respectively.

It was developed at the bequest of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop to educate children of Hawaiian descent, and is designed to serve students from preschool through twelfth grade. The school teaches in the English language a college-prep education enhanced by Hawaiian culture, language and practices, imparting historical and practical value of continuing Hawaiian traditions. It operates 31 preschools statewide and three grade K–12 campuses in Kapālama, Oahu, Pukalani, Maui, and Keaau, Hawaii.

By the terms of its founding, the schools&#x27; admissions policy prefers applicants with Native Hawaiian ancestry. Since 1965 it has excluded all but two non-Hawaiians from being admitted. A lawsuit challenging the school&#x27;s admission policy resulted in a narrow victory for Kamehameha in the Ninth Circuit Court; however, Kamehameha ultimately settled, paying the plaintiff $7 million.

As of the 2011–12 school year, Kamehameha had an enrollment of 5,398 students at its three main campuses and 1,317 children at its preschools, for a total enrollment of 5,416. Beyond its campuses, Kamehameha served an estimated 46,923 Hawaiians in 2011 through its support for public schools, charter schools, and families and caregivers throughout Hawaii.

According to the Kamehameha Schools home website, the mission statement is as follows: &quot;Kamehameha Schools&#x27; mission is to fulfill Pauahi&#x27;s desire to create educational opportunities in perpetuity to improve the capability and well-being of people of Hawaiian ancestry.&quot;

==History==
In 1883, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, a member of the Hawaiian Royal Family, directed in her will, after naming heirs for gifts of money and land, that the remainder of her estate be held in trust to create the Kamehameha Schools. A majority of the Bishop estate was inherited from her parent and her cousin Ruth Keelikōlani, who in turn had inherited a substantial amount from her first husband Leleiohoku I and her half-siblings Victoria Kamāmalu and Kamehameha V, all who were given substantial amounts of land in the Great Mahele of 1848 which had divided the land of the kingdom amongst the King, the ali&#x27;i and the common people. During her lifetime, she experienced and encountered the decline of her Hawaiian people. She was well aware that education was key to the survival of her people and culture; therefore, she left 375,000 acres of ancestral land, entrusting her trustees to use this gift to educate her people.

Bernice named Samuel Mills Damon, William Owen Smith, Charles Montague Cooke, Charles McEwen Hyde, and her husband, Charles Reed Bishop, as the original five trustees to invest her estate at their discretion, use the income to operate the schools, and also &quot;to devote a portion of each year&#x27;s income to the support and education of orphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the preference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.&quot; She also directed the Hawaii (Kingdom) Supreme Court to appoint replacement trustees and required that all teachers be Protestant, without regard to denomination.

After Bishop&#x27;s death in 1884, her husband Charles Reed Bishop carried out her will. Reverend William Brewster Oleson (1851–1915), former principal of the Hilo boarding school founded by David Belden Lyman in 1836, helped organize the schools on a similar model of European-American education. The original Kamehameha School for Boys opened in 1887; after it moved to a new campus, that site was later taken over by the Bishop Museum. The girls&#x27; school opened nearby in 1894. The preparatory school, originally serving grades K–6, opened in 1888 adjacent to the boys&#x27; school. By 1955, all three schools had moved to the current campus in Kapālama Heights. The schools became co-ed in 1965. In 1996, the school opened a campus on Maui, followed in 2001 by the campus on Hawaii.

In 1991, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brought suit against Kamehameha Schools alleging that its requirement that all teachers be Protestant was religious discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Although Kamehameha Schools conceded the practice was discriminatory, the School maintained that it was bound by the provisions of Bernice Pauahi Bishop&#x27;s will, which established the charitable trust creating the School as well as mandating that all the teachers &quot;be persons of the Protestant religion.&quot; Accordingly, the School sought to be included within one of the applicable exemptions to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Then Chief Judge Alan Cooke Kay of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, a great-grandson of Charles Montague Cooke, ruled in Kamehameha&#x27;s favor, finding that the religious education exemption, the religious curriculum exemption, and the bona fide occupational qualification exemption were each applicable to Kamehameha Schools. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court, holding that none of the exemptions to the Civil Rights Act was applicable since the School was essentially a secular and not primarily a religious institution despite certain historical traditions including Protestantism. As a result, the requirement that all teachers be Protestant was held to be a violation of the Civil Rights Act.

===Reorganization===
According to the will, the Supreme Court of Hawaii appointed trustees. After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii by the United States, the Territorial and State Supreme Court assumed that responsibility. However, many trustees were political insiders. By 1997 trustees were paid $800,000 to $900,000 annually. At that time, critics alleged that the trustees were micromanaging the schools and that they had vastly over-rewarded themselves in their pay. Trustees were appointed to positions as &quot;lead trustee&quot; of a particular part of estate operations. In particular, Lokelani Lindsey, lead trustee for educational affairs, was blamed for low morale among students and faculty.

On August 9, 1997, University of Hawaii (UH) Board of Regents Chair (and former Kamehameha Schools Principal) Gladys Brandt, retired judge Walter Heen, Msgr. Charles Kekumano, federal judge Samuel Pailthorpe King, and UH William S. Richardson School of Law professor Randall Roth published a report titled &quot;Broken Trust&quot; in the &quot;Honolulu Star Bulletin.&quot; They called on the State Attorney General to fully investigate KSBE management. The report alleged, among other things, that:
* the method of selecting trustees (appointment by the Hawaii Supreme Court) was flawed
* the trustees did not fully understand their responsibilities
* the trustees were not accountable for their actions.

On August 12, 1997, Governor Ben Cayetano directed Attorney General Margery Bronster to perform a preliminary investigation into the allegations. In her report on September 10, 1997, she found that &quot;the rights of the beneficiaries may be at substantial risk,&quot; and that there were &quot;credible allegations that the intent of Bernice Pauahi Bishop is not being implemented.&quot;
Another essay appeared in November, with Brandt, UH Professor Isabella Abbott, respected Hawaiian cultural educator Winona Beamer, and others as authors. Its headline was &quot;Tyranny, distrust, poor decisions reign at Kamehameha&quot;.

The investigation continued through 1998, when Attorney General Bronster sought the permanent removal of Lindsey and fellow trustees Richard Wong and Henry Peters. On May 6, 1999, after a six-month trial, Lindsey was permanently removed as trustee (Lindsey later appealed her removal). A day later, trustees Wong, Peters, and Gerard Jervis were also temporarily removed. The fifth trustee, Oswald Stender, voluntarily resigned. An interim board was appointed by the Hawaii Probate Court to run the estate.

Bronster had been re-appointed as attorney general by Governor Cayetano, who was a Democrat. Since 23 of the 25 state senators were Democrats, some political observers thought approval of Bronster&#x27;s renomination would be assured. However, the investigation proved costly for Bronster, whose confirmation was defeated by the Hawaii State Senate on April 28, 1999, by a vote of 14–11.

The US Internal Revenue Service retroactively revoked Bishop Estate&#x27;s tax exempt status because of the trustees&#x27; breach of duties and unlawful use of tax exempt charitable trust assets for political lobbying. This action triggered charges of about $1 billion in back taxes and penalties.

Jervis resigned permanently on August 20, 1999. The trials for permanent removal of the remaining three trustees were set for December 13, 1999. Wong offered his permanent resignation on December 3, 1999; Peters did the same on December 13; and Lindsey voluntarily resigned on December 17. Many of the court files relating to Bishop Estate were ordered sealed by the court, citing the need for &quot;closure and healing.&quot;

Although new Bishop Estate trustees were appointed, they had continued to use the same attorneys and law firms as their predecessors. Deputy attorneys general advised the replacement trustees that these attorneys and law firms either had provided flawed legal advice to the previous trustees, or stood by silently while the trustees had ignored good advice. Some claimed &quot;there had been no thorough housecleaning; instead, the old guard had been put in charge and handed the keys.&quot;

In 2002, the Hawaii Supreme Court threw out the criminal indictments against three Bishop Estate trustees on procedural grounds and ruled no new charges could be brought. In 2005, two of the authors of the newspaper series published a book exploring the issues in the full-scale investigation. The controversy was costly to the schools. In 2009, after a large decline in the endowment, trustee compensation ranged from $97,500 to $125,000 per year, and trustees turned down any pay increases.

==Campuses and governance==

Kamehameha Schools operates three campuses, which together served 5,398 students K-12 in the 2011–12 school year. The main campus, established in 1887 as the Kamehameha Schools for Boys, occupies on Kapālama Heights in Honolulu and served 3,200 students, including 550 boarding students from the Neighbor Islands (i.e., the Hawaiian Islands other than Oahu). The campus has more than 70 buildings, including numerous classroom buildings, dormitories, and maintenance shops. It also features extensive athletic facilities, including a 3,000-seat stadium, an Olympic-size swimming pool, three gymnasiums, and several tennis courts.

In 2010, Kamehameha undertook a $118.5 million construction project featuring a brand-new middle school, a Hawaiian cultural center, a new athletics building, and a parking structure. The Kaʻiwakīloumoku Hawaiian Cultural Center opened in October 2012, followed by the other projects in 2013.

The Maui campus, established in 1996 in Pukalani, served 1,084 students. The campus on the island of Hawaii, established in 2001 in Keaau, served 1,118 students. In addition to these three campuses, Kamehameha Schools operates thirty-one preschools throughout Hawaii, which served 1,317 students statewide.

The five-member Board of Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop administers the Schools. Each trustee may serve up to two five-year terms. The 1999 reorganization limited Board micromanagement. A Chief Executive Officer manages day-to-day operations and has autonomy over educational matters.

In April 2021, Kamehameha Schools opened the Kalanihookaha Community Learning Center in Nānākuli.

==Endowment==
A 1995 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article described the Bishop Estate as &quot;the nation&#x27;s wealthiest charity,&quot; with an endowment estimated at $10 billion – greater than the combined endowments of Harvard and Yale universities. As of June 2011, the endowment was US$9.06 billion. Approximately 75% of the endowment is in financial assets, and 25% is in real estate. In 2016, the endowment was $11.1 billion, and in 2021, it was $14.7 billion. When compared against the endowments of major U.S. colleges and universities, only nine schools (Harvard University, Yale University, Stanford University, Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Notre Dame, the University of Texas and Northwestern University), have higher endowments than Kamehameha Schools.

==Land holdings==

Bishop&#x27;s original bequest consisted of of land worth around $474,000. More than are still controlled by the estate. The book value of the land for accounting purposes is probably much lower than fair market value. Kamehameha Schools&#x27; Land Assets Division manages nearly of this land, which is used for agricultural and conservation purposes. The remaining are designated for commercial use; approximately of those acres actively generate revenue.

Kamehameha Schools&#x27; commercial real estate includes owned and operated properties and ground lease holdings. Commercial properties operating on Kamehameha Schools land include shopping centers, such as Windward Mall, Pearlridge, Kahala Mall, and Royal Hawaiian Center; and hotels, such as the Kahala Hotel &amp; Resort, the Four Seasons Resort Hualālai, and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

Kamehameha is also redeveloping several of its urban real estate properties in Haleiwa, Kāhala, Kakaako, Kapālama, and Mōʻiliʻili to revitalize those areas and increase commercial revenue.

On October 22, 2013, Kamehameha Schools announced that it would sell the buildings of its largest single real estate property (in terms of value), the Royal Hawaiian Center. The shopping center encompasses three blocks of prime Waikīkī real estate on Kalākaua Avenue.

In August 2024, Kamehameha Schools was part of a $4 billion settlement related to the 2023 Maui fire. The school was a party to the lawsuit due to their ownership of large parcels of land which were poorly maintained, which in turn fed the wildfires.

==Admission==
Kamehameha Schools is a private organization to which students apply for admission. At the Kapālama campus, the process is highly selective. Acceptance rates range from approximately 6.7% to 14.7% depending on the grade for which a student applies. Acceptance rates at the Maui and Hawaii campuses are generally higher, ranging from approximately 9.2% to 24%, due to those islands&#x27; smaller populations and the lack of boarding students at those facilities. The current enrollment is &gt;6,900 students.

In accordance with a century-old interpretation of the will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, Kamehameha Schools gives preference to applicants of Native Hawaiian descent &quot;to the extent permitted by law.&quot; Orphans and indigent applicants receive special consideration as adjured in Pauahi&#x27;s will. Preference applicants must submit evidence verifying that at least one of their pre-1959 ancestors is Hawaiian.

The schools&#x27; admissions policy has been a subject of controversy. Because far more applicants claim Hawaiian ancestry than the schools can admit, virtually all students have some Native Hawaiian ancestry. Non-Hawaiians have attended and graduated, but this is extremely rare. In 2002, Kamehameha admitted one non-Hawaiian student, Kalani Rosell, to its Maui campus, for the first time in 40 years. Rosell was admitted after all qualified Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. This decision sparked alumni protest. Kamehameha&#x27;s admissions policy was the focus of two federal lawsuits, which contended that preferring Native Hawaiians is a race-based exclusion that violates U.S. civil rights law. Both lawsuits have since been settled and the admission policy stands today.

=== Mohica-Cummings lawsuit ===
In August 2003, Brayden Gay Mohica-Cummings was a seventh-grader admitted to Kapālama Heights after his mother, who is the &quot;hānai&quot; (adopted) daughter of a Hawaiian family, said he was Hawaiian. The school rescinded its admission offer when his mother was unable to document his ancestry. Because Kamehameha rescinded the offer only a week before the school year started, his family sued the school for admission. Chief Judge David Alan Ezra issued a temporary restraining order requiring Kamehameha to admit Mohica-Cummings. The case was settled out-of-court in November 2003, when Kamehameha Schools agreed to let Mohica-Cummings attend, in exchange for dropping the lawsuit.

===&quot;John Doe v. Kamehameha&quot;===
In June 2003, a suit was filed on behalf of an unidentified non-Hawaiian student, claiming that preferring Hawaiian applicants violates provisions of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits racial discrimination in private contracts. In November, now Senior Judge Alan Cooke Kay ruled in favor of Kamehameha again, dismissing the lawsuit and finding that Kamehameha Schools&#x27; policy served a &quot;legitimate, remedial purpose by improving native Hawaiians&#x27; socioeconomic and educational disadvantages&quot;.

In August 2005, however, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed 2–1, and ruled that the policy was racially exclusionary. A protest march by native Hawaiians, including Hawaii&#x27;s governor and lieutenant governor, to Iolani Palace and a rally on the palace grounds attracted an estimated 10–15,000 participants.

The Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the appeal before a 15-judge &quot;en banc&quot; panel in February 2006. On December 5, 2006, by a vote of 8–7, the &quot;en banc&quot; panel reversed the earlier decision by the three-judge panel, affirming Judge Kay&#x27;s earlier ruling. The majority ruled that Kamehameha&#x27;s policy does not run afoul of a civil rights law, citing what it said were unique factors in the history of Hawaii, the socioeconomic plight of Native Hawaiians, and the schools&#x27; distinctively remedial mission, which Congress has repeatedly endorsed. The dissent stated that civil rights law &quot;prohibits a private school from denying admission to prospective students because of their race.&quot; It was very skeptical of the majority interpretation, stating, &quot;The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from § 1981 [civil rights law]&quot;.

Following the decision, the plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys appealed to the United States Supreme Court. However, before the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the case, &quot;Doe v. Kamehameha&quot; was settled. Both this settlement and the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision prompted a procession at the Kapālama campus, leading to an all-school assembly. On February 8, 2008, John Goemans, attorney for John Doe, disclosed that the amount of the settlement was $7 million USD.

On August 6, 2008, Kamehameha Schools announced that it had sued John Doe for breaching a confidentiality agreement by making the settlement amount public. After Goemans died, Doe&#x27;s family settled, agreeing to pay $1.4 million to the school.

Also in 2008, John Doe&#x27;s attorneys, Eric Grant and David Rosen, filed another lawsuit against Kamehameha on behalf of four other non-Hawaiian children who wanted to attend the school. As in the prior John Doe lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought to proceed anonymously, fearing harassment if their identities were made public. In the prior case, Kamehameha never objected to the plaintiff&#x27;s anonymity, but in this case the school did object. A U.S. magistrate judge and then district court judge ruled that the plaintiffs could only continue the lawsuit under their real names, deciding that the prejudice to the defendants and the public&#x27;s interest in open courts outweighed the plaintiffs&#x27; fears of harm. A Ninth Circuit panel affirmed that decision in 2010. Later that year, the Ninth Circuit refused a request for rehearing en banc, although several judges wrote lengthy dissents, referring to &quot;Kill Haole Day&quot; at Hawaii&#x27;s schools and arguing the plaintiffs&#x27; safety would be jeopardized without anonymity. In 2011, the Supreme Court declined to review the decision and the plaintiffs chose to end the lawsuit rather than reveal their identities.

===Sex abuse settlements===
On April 24, 2020, it was revealed that Kamehameha Schools was paying $80 million in settlements. The settlements involve sex abuse claims against psychiatrist Robert Browne, who was said to have sexually abused children in the 1960s and 1970s while serving at the schools.

==Academics==
All three of Kamehameha&#x27;s campuses are college-preparatory and offer honors courses. In addition, the Kapālama campus offers 20 Advanced Placement courses, while the Hawaii campus offers eight. The Kapālama high school administered 344 Advanced Placement exams in 2014.

Upper-class students at the Maui and Hawaii campus high schools select a career academy based on their individual interests. They develop course schedules designed to enhance skills for potential careers within their academy&#x27;s scope. The Maui campus offers academies for arts and communication, business, information technology or engineering, and science and natural resources, while the Hawaii campus offers academies for humanities and STE(A)M (science, technology, engineering, (arts), and mathematics).

Approximately 70% of Kamehameha graduates enroll in four-year universities, while 25% enroll in two-year colleges or technical schools. Students in the 2010 graduating class of the Kapālama campus had an average composite SAT score of 1560 out of 2400. In the 2014 graduating class, there were 4 National Merit semi-finalists and 9 commended students.

As students each have Native Hawaiian ancestry, Kamehameha emphasizes Hawaiian language and culture in its curriculum. The Kapālama high school offers a six-year program in Hawaiian language and requires its students to achieve Hawaiian language proficiency equivalent to one year of study. It also offers various supplementary courses in Hawaiian culture, history, literature, song composition and performance, chant, dance, and crafts.

==Community outreach==
Kamehameha offers several distance learning programs for high school students, adults, and educators to learn Hawaiian language and culture over the Internet. The program includes an archived series of instructional videos entitled &quot;Kulāiwi&quot; for learning the Hawaiian language; these are available for free online streaming. Kamehameha also operates Kamehameha Publishing, which prints and sells Hawaiian-language books, posters, and multimedia.

As a part of its 2000-2015 Strategic Plan, generated by wide community input, Kamehameha Schools partners with more than 20 community-based organizations across the archipelago through its Aina Ulu program to deliver natural and cultural resource stewardship education programs and services to over 25,000 participants annually. Aina Ulu provides an asset-management strategy by integrating community, education, cultural, environmental and economic outcomes to manage resources and lands to enhance prudent and sustainable use, responsible stewardship and supportive community relationships. By engaging community volunteers and expertise, Aina Ulu partners manage, protect and restore native watershed, dryland and rain forests; riparian, coastal, and estuarine ecosystems, including Hawaiian fishponds; and Hawaiian food systems, including dry field systems, as well as wet field systems call loi.

Kamehameha also offers several programs and services for high school graduates. Along with the Ke Alii Pauahi Foundation, Kamehameha offers a variety of need and merit-based scholarships for those pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate education. Its career counseling program provides advice and counseling for post-high school students and operates an internship program for various companies statewide. The First Nations&#x27; Futures Program, operated in conjunction with Stanford University and the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, is a fellowship program designed to develop &quot;a select team of emerging leaders... to become significant community contributors in natural, cultural and land stewardship.&quot;

==Song contest==

The Kamehameha Schools Song Contest is an annual choral competition in which groups of students of the Kapālama campus perform Hawaiian mele. The event, hosted in Honolulu, is broadcast live on TV and is also live streamed online. According to the 2008 program, the goals of the contest are to develop leadership and foster cooperation and class spirit among the students as well as to increase student awareness of their cultural heritage by allowing them to use their singing voices to express themselves.

The first contest (then called the Inter-class Sing Competition) was held in 1921. It was started to perpetuate the memory of George Alanson Andrus, a music teacher at the School. The event was originally held on campus, but moved to the Neal S. Blaisdell Center (formerly the Honolulu International Auditorium) in 1964 where it has been held ever since. The 2008 contest was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;One Voice&quot;.

<text>Microsoft XNA (a recursive acronym for XNA&#x27;s not acronymed) is a freeware set of tools with a managed runtime environment that Microsoft Gaming developed to facilitate video game development. XNA is based on .NET Framework, with versions that run on Windows and Xbox 360. XNA Game Studio can help develop XNA games. The XNA toolset was announced on March 24, 2004, at the Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California. A first Community Technology Preview of XNA Build was released on March 14, 2006.

In many respects&quot;, XNA&quot; can be thought of as a .NET analog to Microsoft&#x27;s better known game development system, DirectX, but it is aimed at developers primarily interested in writing lightweight games. XNA is the basic platform for Xbox Live Indie Games.

As of January 2013, XNA is no longer being developed, and it is not compatible with Windows Runtime (the API for developing Metro-style apps), which was introduced with Windows 8.

==Overview==

===XNA Framework===
Microsoft XNA Framework is based on the native implementation of .NET Compact Framework 2.0 for Xbox 360 development and .NET Framework 2.0 on Windows. It includes an extensive set of class libraries, specific to game development, to promote maximum code reuse across target platforms. The framework runs on a version of the Common Language Runtime that is optimized for gaming to provide a managed execution environment. The runtime is available for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Phone and Xbox 360. Since XNA games are written for the runtime, they can run on any platform that supports the XNA Framework with minimal or no modification. Games that run on the framework can technically be written in any .NET-compliant language, but only C# in XNA Game Studio Express IDE and all versions of Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 (as of XNA 4.0) are officially supported. Support for Visual Basic .NET was added in 2011.

The XNA Framework encapsulates low-level technological details involved in coding a game, making sure that the framework itself takes care of the difference between platforms when games are ported from one compatible platform to another, and thereby allowing game developers to focus more on the content and gaming experience. The XNA Framework integrates with a number of tools, such as the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), to aid in content creation.

The XNA Framework provides support for both 2D and 3D game creation and allows use of the Xbox 360 controllers and vibrations. XNA framework games that target the Xbox 360 platform could only be distributed by members of the Microsoft XNA Creator&#x27;s Club/App Hub, which carried a $99/year subscription fee. Desktop applications can be distributed free of charge under Microsoft&#x27;s current licensing.

===XNA Build===
XNA Build is a set of game asset pipeline management tools, which help by defining, maintaining, debugging, and optimizing the &quot;game asset pipeline&quot; of individual game development efforts. A &quot;game asset pipeline&quot; describes the process by which game content, such as textures and 3D models, are modified to a form suitable for use by the gaming engine. XNA Build helps identify the pipeline dependencies, and also provides API access to enable further processing of the dependency data. The dependency data can be analyzed to help reduce the size of a game by finding content that is not actually used. For example, XNA Build analysis revealed that 40% of the textures that shipped with &quot;MechCommander 2&quot; were unused and could have been omitted.

===XNA Game Studio===

XNA Game Studio is a programming environment for development of games. Five revisions have been released so far, but as of 2015, no new versions will be developed.

XNA Game Studio Express was the first version released on August 30, 2006, and was intended for students, hobbyists, and independent game developers. It was available as a free download. Express provides basic &quot;starter kits&quot; for rapid development of specific genres of games, such as platform games, real-time strategy, and first-person shooters. Developers could create Windows games for free with the XNA Framework, but to run their games on the Xbox 360 they will have to pay an annual fee of US$99 (or a four-month fee of US$49) for admission to the Microsoft XNA Creator&#x27;s Club. With an update, XNA developers could compile Xbox 360 binaries and share them with other Microsoft XNA Creator&#x27;s Club members.

XNA Game Studio 2.0 was released on December 13, 2007. XNA Game Studio 2.0 features the ability to be used with all versions of Visual Studio 2005 (including the free Visual C# 2005 Express Edition), a networking API using Xbox Live on both Windows and Xbox 360 and better device handling.

XNA Game Studio 3.0 (for Visual Studio 2008 or the free Visual C# 2008 Express Edition) allows production of games targeting the Zune platform and adds Xbox Live community support. It was released on October 30, 2008, and supported C# 3.0, LINQ and most versions of Visual Studio 2008.

XNA Game Studio 4.0 was released on September 16, 2010. It added support for the Windows Phone platform (including 3D hardware acceleration), framework hardware profiles, configurable effects, built-in state objects, graphics device scalars and orientation, cross-platform and multi-touch input, microphone input and buffered audio playback, and Visual Studio 2010 integration.

XNA &quot;Game Studio 4.0 Refresh&quot; was released on 6 October 2011, and added support for Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango), and Visual Basic.

===XNA Framework Content Pipeline===
The XNA Framework Content Pipeline is a set of tools that allows Visual Studio and XNA Studio to act &quot;as the key design point around organizing and consuming 3D content&quot;.

===XDK Extensions===

Formerly known as XNA Game Studio Professional, XDK Extensions is an add-on to XNA Game Studio and requires the Microsoft Xbox 360 Development Kit. Both are only available for licensed Xbox developers. The extensions include additional managed APIs for achievements, leaderboards, and other features reserved for licensed game titles. Titles developed using XDK Extensions include winners of Microsoft&#x27;s Dream.Build.Play competition among others. The most heavily publicized of these was &quot;The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai&quot;.

==License agreement==

The Microsoft XNA Framework 2.0 EULA specifically prohibits the distribution of commercial networked games that connect to Xbox Live and/or Games for Windows Live in the absence of a specific agreement signed by both the developer and Microsoft. This means that XNA Game Studio can still be used to develop commercial games and other programs for the Windows platform, although Microsoft&#x27;s networking support code for Xbox/Windows Live cannot be used. Self-developed network code can still be used inside the developer&#x27;s XNA project.

Games created using XNA Game Studio may be distributed via the Windows Phone marketplace, and formerly via Xbox Live Indie Games. The software may also be used to create commercial games which target Windows.

==Dream Build Play==

Dream Build Play was an annual and global $75,000 Microsoft contest promoting Microsoft XNA and eventually Xbox Live Indie Games, although it predated it. The contest was first announced in 2006 and first opened in January 2007. Many winners are notable developers in the Indie game community.

==Xbox Live Indie Games==

Xbox 360 games written in XNA Game Studio could be submitted to the App Hub, for which premium membership was required (about US$99/year). All games submitted to the App Hub were subjected to peer review by other creators. If the game passed review then it would be listed on Xbox Live Marketplace. Creators could set a price of 80, 240 or 400 points for their game. The creator is paid 70% of the total revenue from their game sales as a baseline. Microsoft originally planned to take an additional percentage of revenue if they provided additional marketing for a game, but this policy was rescinded in March 2009, leaving the flat rate intact regardless of promotion.

Microsoft also distributed a free year premium App Hub subscription for educational establishments through their DreamSpark program and MSDNAA. These accounts allowed students to develop games for the Xbox 360, but developers still needed a premium Xbox Live account to submit their game to the marketplace.

==Alternative implementations==
A project called Mono.XNA was formed to port XNA to the open source and cross-platform Mono framework.

From the codebase of Mono.XNA and SilverSprite, a new project called MonoGame was formed to port XNA to several mobile devices. As of version 3.0.1 (released March 3, 2013), support is stable for iOS, Android including OUYA, macOS, Linux and Metro for Windows 8, Windows RT and Windows Phone 8, as well as PlayStation Mobile in 2D. PlayStation Mobile 3D and Raspberry Pi development are currently in progress.

FNA is a full-featured open source reimplementation of XNA forked from MonoGame. The goal of FNA is to preserve the XNA game library by reimplementing XNA itself.

An open source project called Grommet contains a limited port for embedded devices using the .NET Micro Framework.

A project called ANX is available which implements its own version of XNA using the SharpDX stack; support for Linux, macOS and the PlayStation Vita is in progress as well. Using ANX, developers are able to write games using code that is very similar to XNA, while still being considered a Metro application in Windows 8.

<doc id="550621" wikidata="Q135183" url="?curid=550621" title="Vibrio vulnificus">
<text>Vibrio vulnificus is a species of Gram-negative, motile, curved rod-shaped (vibrio), pathogenic bacteria of the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot;. Present in marine environments such as estuaries, brackish ponds, or coastal areas, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is related to &quot;&quot;V. cholerae&quot;&quot;, the causative agent of cholera. At least one strain of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is bioluminescent.
Increasing seasonal ocean temperatures and low-salt marine environments like estuaries favor a greater concentration of &quot;Vibrio&quot; within filter-feeding shellfish; &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; infections in the Eastern United States have increased eightfold from 1988–2018.

Infection with &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; leads to rapidly expanding skin infections by entering a wound causing cellulitis or even sepsis. &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is also a source of foodborne illness. It was first isolated as a source of disease in 1976.

==Strains==
&quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; is a species of gram-negative, motile, curved rod-shaped (bacillus), pathogenic bacteria of the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot;. Present in marine environments such as estuaries, brackish ponds, or coastal areas, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is related to &quot;&quot;V. cholerae&quot;&quot;, the causative agent of cholera.
The most harmful strains of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; documented have been observed in three different forms. The first is in an anti-phagocytic polysaccharide capsule that protects the bacteria. By encapsulating the bacteria, phagocytosis, and opsonization can not occur, thus allowing the bacteria to continue throughout the organism it is in. The second way that &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; has been most harmful is with some of the toxins that it creates. These toxins are not part of the infection that &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; causes but instead they are part of a secondary infection in the gastrointestinal tract that most certainly will lead to systemic infection. Lastly, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; has been seen to cause more harm in patients who have higher levels of iron.

===Genome size===

The genome size of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is approximately 5.3 Mbp. The genome is organized into two circular replicons, similar to that of &quot;V. cholerae&quot;, which also has a large and small chromosome. However, the genome of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is at least one megabase bigger.

===Natural transformation===
Natural transformation is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer between individual cells. &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; was found to become naturally transformable during growth on chitin in the form of crab shells. The ability to now carry out transformation experiments in the laboratory should facilitate molecular genetic analysis of this opportunistic pathogen.

==Signs and symptoms==
&quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; is an extremely virulent bacterium that can cause three types of infections:
* Acute gastroenteritis from eating raw or undercooked shellfish: &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; causes an infection often incurred after eating seafood, especially raw or undercooked oysters. It does not alter the appearance, taste, or odor of oysters. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
* Necrotizing wound infections can occur in injured skin exposed to contaminated marine water. &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; bacteria can enter the body through open wounds when swimming or wading in infected waters, or by puncture wounds from the spines of fishes such as stingrays. People may develop a blistering dermatitis sometimes mistaken for pemphigus or pemphigoid.
* Invasive sepsis can occur after eating raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters. &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is 80 times more likely to spread into the bloodstream in people with compromised immune systems, especially those with chronic liver disease. When this happens, severe symptoms including blistering skin lesions and septic shock can sometimes lead to death. This severe infection may occur regardless of whether the infection began from contaminated food or an open wound.

Among healthy people, ingestion of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In someone with a compromised immune system, particularly those with chronic liver disease, it can infect the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions. While men have been shown to be more at risk from this infection than women, co-morbidities such as alcoholic cirrhosis and diseases affecting the endocrine system (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) put a person far more at risk of developing an infection from &quot;V. vulnificus.&quot;

==Pathogenesis==
Capsule: &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; has a capsule, made of polysaccharides, and is thought to protect against phagocytosis. The capsule also aids the bacteria in escaping opsonization. Different strains of the bacteria are capable of shifting through the unencapsulated and encapsulated forms. Mouse models have shown that the unencapsulated forms are avirulent. These same strains, however, are shown to have a higher predisposition to shift to the virulent encapsulated form when taken up by oysters.

Endotoxin: Like all gram-negative bacteria, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; has LPS (lipopolysaccharide as the major component of its outer membrane). However, the LPS the bacteria produces isn&#x27;t as efficient at triggering the immune system&#x27;s release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and other cytokines that produce shock syndromes. The capsular proteins the bacteria express, however, are capable of producing an immune response contributing to shock syndrome.

Exotoxin: &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; produces a number of extracellular toxins such as metalloprotease VvpE, cytolysin/hemolysin VvhA, and the multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxins (MARTX) toxin. While the VvhA and MARTX toxin are factors in the bacteria&#x27;s virulence, in vivo studies in mice suggest that the MARTX toxin is more responsible for bacterial dissemination from the intestine to produce sepsis.

Iron: Growth of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; is dependent on the amount of iron that is accessible to the bacteria. The observed association of the infection with liver disease (associated with increased serum iron) might be due to the capability of more virulent strains to capture iron bound to transferrin.

Type IV Pilus: &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; has genes that encode for the biosynthesis of a type IV pilus. These genes have been located on the large chromosome and may help &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; adhere to host cells and with motility. 

==Treatment==
&quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; wound infections have a mortality rate of around 25%. In people in whom the infection worsens into sepsis, typically following ingestion, the mortality rate rises to 50%. The majority of these people die within the first 48 hours of infection. The optimal treatment is not known, but in one retrospective study of 93 people in Taiwan, the use of a third-generation cephalosporin and a tetracycline (e.g., ceftriaxone and doxycycline, respectively) was associated with an improved outcome. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm this finding, but &quot;in vitro&quot; data support the suggestion that this combination is synergistic against &quot;V. vulnificus&quot;. Likewise, the American Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend treating the person with a quinolone or intravenous doxycycline with ceftazidime. The first successful documented treatment of fulminant &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; sepsis was in 1995. Treatment was ceftazidime and intravenous (IV) ciprofloxacin and IV doxycycline, which proved successful. Prevention of secondary infections from respiratory failure and acute renal failure is crucial. Key to the diagnosis and treatment were the early recognition of bullae in an immunocompromised person with liver cirrhosis and oyster ingestion within the previous 48 hours, and the request by the physician for STAT Gram staining and blood cultures for &quot;V. vulnificus&quot;. Amputation of limbs may be required. &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; often causes large, disfiguring ulcers that require extensive debridement or even amputation.

==Prognosis==
&quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; is the most common cause of death due to seafood in the United States, causing over 95% of deaths that are known to have occurred due to ingested seafood. If treatment with tetracycline or other cephalosporin antibiotics is initiated at the onset of symptoms and the full course followed, patients generally experience no long-term effects.

The worst prognosis is in those people arriving at the hospital in a state of shock. Total mortality in treated people (ingestion and wound) is around 33%.

People especially vulnerable are those with liver disease (especially cirrhosis and hepatitis) or immunocompromised states (some kinds of cancer, bone marrow suppression, HIV, diabetes, etc.). In these cases, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; usually enters the bloodstream, where it may cause fever and chills, septic shock (with sharply decreased blood pressure), and blistering skin lesions. About half of those who contract blood infections die. 

The consumption of contaminated raw oysters in those with chronic liver disease causes primary sepsis with a mortality rate of over 50%. Exposure of wounds to contaminated seawater or handling of contaminated seafood products causes infections with a mortality rate of about 25%.

&quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; infections also disproportionately affect males; 85% of those developing endotoxic shock from the bacteria are male. Females having had an oophorectomy experienced increased mortality rates, as estrogen has been shown experimentally to have a protective effect against &quot;V. vulnificus&quot;.

==Epidemiology==

&quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; is commonly found in the Gulf of Mexico, where more than a dozen people have died from the infection since 1990. Most deaths at that time were occurring due to fulminant sepsis, either in the area of oyster harvest and ingestion, or in tourists returning home. Lack of disease recognition, and also of the risk factors, presentation, and cause, were and are major obstacles to good outcome and recovery.

Increasing seasonal temperatures and decreasing salinity levels seem to favor a greater concentration of &quot;Vibrio&quot; within filter-feeding shellfish of the U.S. Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico, especially oysters (&quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;). Scientists have frequently demonstrated the presence of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; in the gut of oysters and other shellfish and in the intestines of fish that inhabit oyster reefs. The vast majority of people who develop sepsis from &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; became ill after they ate raw oysters; most of these cases have been men.

According to the CDC, &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; infections in the Eastern United States increased eightfold from 1988–2018 and the border of where these infections occur has migrated 48 km Northward each year. In July–August 2023, Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina, reported severe and fatal V. vulnificus infections.

==Research==
While the treatment for &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; can be as straightforward as making the rapid choice of appropriate antibiotics, there have been cases in which the genes mutated, thus rendering antibiotics ineffective. While looking for an answer to this problem, researchers found that one way to stop the infection from spreading is to again mutate the bacteria. This mutation happens on the flagellum of the bacteria. When injected with flgC and flgE (two genes in the flagella that cause the mutation), the flagellum no longer function properly. When unable to move normally, the bacteria is no longer able to spread toxins through the body, thus decreasing the effect that &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; has on the body systemically.

==History==
The pathogen was first isolated in 1976 from a series of blood culture samples submitted to the CDC in Atlanta. It was described as a &quot;lactose-positive vibrio&quot;. It was initially given the name &quot;Beneckea vulnifica&quot;, and then finally the name &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; by J. J. Farmer in 1979.

In 2005, health officials clearly identified strains of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; infections among evacuees from New Orleans due to the flooding there caused by Hurricane Katrina.

In 2015, eight cases of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; infection were reported in Florida, with two resulting in death.

In 2022, following Hurricane Ian, Lee County, Florida, saw a sharp rise in infections and deaths from &quot;V. vulnificus&quot;. By October 18, 2022, four deaths and 29 illnesses had been recorded since the landfall of the hurricane in late September.

In 2023, it was reported that a 40-year-old woman from California had been infected by &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; after eating undercooked fish (tilapia). She had her four limbs removed to save her life. However, upon further investigation, local public health officials reported no evidence of &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; infection in her case.

<text>In particle physics, a tetraquark is an exotic meson composed of four valence quarks. A tetraquark state has long been suspected to be allowed by quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of strong interactions. A tetraquark state is an example of an exotic hadron that lies outside the conventional quark model classification. A number of different types of tetraquark have been observed.

==History and discoveries==

Several tetraquark candidates have been reported by particle physics experiments in the 21st century. The quark contents of these states are almost all qQ, where q represents a light (up, down or strange) quark, Q represents a heavy (charm or bottom) quark, and antiquarks are denoted with an overline. The existence and stability of tetraquark states with the qq (or QQ) have been discussed by theoretical physicists for a long time, however these are yet to be reported by experiments.
;Timeline
In 2003, a particle temporarily called X(3872), by the Belle experiment in Japan, was proposed to be a tetraquark candidate, as originally theorized. The name X is a temporary name, indicating that there are still some questions about its properties to be tested. The number following is the mass of the particle in .

In 2004, the DsJ(2632) state seen in Fermilab&#x27;s SELEX was suggested as a possible tetraquark candidate.

In 2007, Belle announced the observation of the Z(4430) state, a tetraquark candidate. There are also indications that the Y(4660), also discovered by Belle in 2007, could be a tetraquark state.

In 2009, Fermilab announced that they have discovered a particle temporarily called Y(4140), which may also be a tetraquark.

In 2010, two physicists from DESY and a physicist from Quaid-i-Azam University re-analyzed former experimental data and announced that, in connection with the (5S) meson (a form of bottomonium), a well-defined tetraquark resonance exists.

In June 2013, the BES III experiment in China and the Belle experiment in Japan independently reported on Zc(3900), the first confirmed four-quark state.

In 2014, the Large Hadron Collider experiment LHCb confirmed the existence of the Z(4430) state with a significance of over 13.9 σ.

In February 2016, the DØ experiment reported evidence of a narrow tetraquark candidate, named X(5568), decaying to .
In December 2017, DØ also reported observing the X(5568) using a different final state.
However, it was not observed in searches by the LHCb, CMS, CDF, or ATLAS experiments.

In June 2016, LHCb announced the discovery of three additional tetraquark candidates, called X(4274), X(4500) and X(4700).

In 2020, LHCb announced the discovery of a

tetraquark: X(6900). In 2022, ATLAS also observed X(6900), and in 2023, CMS reported an observation of three such states, X(6600), X(6900), and X(7300).

In 2021, LHCb announced the discovery of four additional tetraquarks, including cu.

In 2022, LHCb announced the discovery of cu and cd.

<doc id="550623" wikidata="Q1434915" url="?curid=550623" title="Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting">
<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting has been presented since 1998, for a distinguished example of explanatory reporting that illuminates a significant and complex subject, demonstrating mastery of the subject, lucid writing and clear presentation. From 1985 to 1997, it was known as the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism.

The Pulitzer Prize Board announced the new category in November 1984, citing a series of explanatory articles that seven months earlier had won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. The series, &quot;Making It Fly&quot; by Peter Rinearson of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, was a 29,000-word account of the development of the Boeing 757 jetliner. It had been entered in the National Reporting category, but judges moved it to Feature Writing to award it a prize. In the aftermath, the Pulitzer Prize Board said it was creating the new category in part because of the ambiguity about where explanatory accounts such as &quot;Making It Fly&quot; should be recognized. The Pulitzer Committee issues an official citation explaining the reasons for the award.

<text>The Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, designated the Hawaii State Museum of Natural and Cultural History, is a museum of history and science in the historic Kalihi district of Honolulu on the Hawaiian island of Oʻahu. Founded in 1889, it is the largest museum in Hawaiʻi and has the world&#x27;s largest collection of Polynesian cultural artifacts and natural history specimens. Besides the comprehensive exhibits of Hawaiian cultural material, the museum&#x27;s total holding of natural history specimens exceeds 24 million, of which the entomological collection alone represents more than 13.5 million specimens (making it the third-largest insect collection in the United States). The &quot;Index Herbariorum&quot; code assigned to Herbarium Pacificum of this museum is BISH and this abbreviation is used when citing housed herbarium specimens.

The museum complex is home to the Richard T. Mamiya Science Adventure Center.

==History==
===Establishment===
Charles Reed Bishop (1822–1915), a businessman and philanthropist, co-founder of the First Hawaiian Bank and Kamehameha Schools, built the museum in memory of his late wife, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop (1831–1884). Born into the royal family, she was the last legal heir of the Kamehameha Dynasty, which had ruled the Kingdom of Hawaii between 1810 and 1872. Bishop had originally intended the museum to house family heirlooms passed down to him through the royal lineage of his wife.

Bishop hired William Tufts Brigham as the first curator of the museum; Brigham later served as director from 1898 until his retirement in 1918.

The museum was built on the original boys&#x27; campus of Kamehameha Schools, an institution created at the bequest of the Princess, to benefit native Hawaiian children; she gave details in her last will and testament. In 1898, Bishop had Hawaiian Hall and Polynesian Hall built on the campus, in the popular Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. The &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; newspaper dubbed these two structures as &quot;the noblest buildings of Honolulu&quot;.

Today both halls are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hawaiian Hall is home to a complete sperm-whale skeleton, accompanied by a papier-mâché body suspended above the central gallery. Along the walls are prized koa wood display cases; today this wood in total is worth more than the original Bishop Museum buildings.

The museum is accessible on public transit: TheBus Routes A, 1, 2, 7, 10.

=== Kaimiloa Expedition ===
In 1924, American millionaire, Medford Ross Kellum, outfitted a four masted barquentine for a scientific expedition which, even the naming of the ship &quot;Kaimiloa&quot;, was left entirely to the scientific circles of Honolulu.

The goal of the expedition was a five-year exploration of many of the then inaccessible spots of the Pacific. Under the auspices of the Bishop Museum, a group of Hawaii scientists joined the ship: Gerrit P. Wilder, botanist; Mrs. Wilder, historian; Kenneth Emory, ethnologist; Dr. Armstrong Sperry, writer and illustrator; and Dr. Stanley Ball.

The vessel was a complete floating laboratory, possibly the most complete of any craft that has undertaken a similar trip. Bottles, crates, and boxes were stowed below, along with gallons of preservatives for insects and plant specimens for the Bishop Museum. 
The goals of the expedition were exhaustive:
* complete collections of islands subjects ranging from insects, plants, minerals, and archaeological and ethnological specimens,
* study of the fish and sea life, 
* chart as accurately as possible the ocean currents,
* for the United States government, conform and correct to the findings of the expedition the charts of the island groups,
* attempt to trace the origin of the Polynesians, their language and their migrations, 
* photograph the natives and measure accurately portions of their bodies,
* record phonographically records of the speech, the songs, their chants, 
* sound the ocean floor and study the formation of the islands in an effort to prove the unfounded but at the time prevalent theory that some Pacific islands were once a part of the mainland and that they formed a &quot;lost continent&quot;.

===Later development===

In 1940, Kamehameha Schools moved to its new campus in Kapālama, allowing the museum to expand at the original campus site. Bishop Hall, first built for use by the school, was adapted for museum use. Most other school structures were razed, and new museum facilities were constructed. By the late 1980s, the Bishop Museum had become the largest natural and cultural history institution in Polynesia.

In 1988, construction of the Castle Memorial Building was begun. Dedicated on January 13, 1990, Castle Memorial Building houses all the major traveling exhibits that come to the Bishop Museum from institutions around the world.

The Richard T. Mamiya Science Adventure Center opened in November 2005. The building is designed as a learning center for children, and includes many interactive exhibits focused on marine science, volcanology, and related sciences.

==Library and archives==
The museum library has one of the most extensive collections of books, periodicals, newspapers and special collections concerned with Hawaiʻi and the Pacific. The archives hold the results of extensive studies done by museum staff in the Pacific Basin, as well as manuscripts, photographs, artwork, oral histories, commercial sound recordings and maps.

When Bishop Museum opened to the public in June 1891, its library consisted of but a few shelves of books in what is today the Picture Gallery.

Many of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s royalty, including Bernice Pauahi Bishop and Queen Liliʻuokalani, deposited their personal papers at Bishop Museum. Manuscripts in the collection also include scientific papers, genealogical records, and memorabilia.
The book collection consists of approximately 50,000 volumes with an emphasis on the cultural and natural history of Hawaiʻi and the Pacific, with subject strengths in anthropology, music, botany, entomology, and zoology. The library provides extra access to the collection of published diaries, narratives, memoirs, and other writings relating to 18th- and 19th-century Hawaiʻi.

==Institutions==
On the campus of Bishop Museum is the Jhamandas Watumull Planetarium, an educational and research facility devoted to the astronomical sciences and the oldest planetarium in Polynesia.

Also on the campus is Pauahi Hall, home to the J. Linsley Gressit Center for Research in Entomology, which houses some 14 million prepared specimens of insects and related arthropods, including over 16,500 primary types. It is the third-largest entomology collection in the United States and the eighth-largest in the world. An active research facility, Pauahi Hall is not open to the public.

Nearby is Pākī Hall, home to the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame, a museum library and archives, which are open to the public.

In 1992, the Hawaii State legislature created the Hawaii Biological Survey (HBS) as a program of the Bishop Museum. The HBS surveys, collects, inventories, studies, and maintains the reference collection of every plant and animal found in Hawaiʻi. It currently holds more than 4 million specimens in its collections.

From 1988 until 2009, the Bishop Museum also administered the Hawaii Maritime Center in downtown Honolulu. Built on a former private pier of Honolulu Harbor for the royal family, the center was the premier maritime museum in the Pacific Rim with artifacts in relation to the Pacific whaling industry and the Hawaii steamship industry.

On the Big Island of Hawaiʻi, the Bishop Museum administers the Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden, specializing in indigenous Hawaiian plant life.

Since 1920, the Secretariat of the Pacific Science Association (PSA), founded that year as an independent regional, non-governmental, scholarly organization, has been based at Bishop Museum. It seeks to advance science and technology in support of sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific.

==&quot;Falls of Clyde&quot;==
From 1968 until September 2008, the Bishop Museum owned the &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot;, the oldest sail-driven oil tanker, which was moored at the Hawaiʻi Maritime Center. In early 2007, the ship was closed to public tours for safety reasons and in order to facilitate repairs to the deteriorating tank, which frequently caused the ship to list (tilt) dramatically. Marine experts conducted a thorough inspection of the ship. Between 1998 and 2008 the museum incurred more than $2 million in preservation costs.

The museum threatened to sink the ship by the end of 2008 unless private funds were raised for a perpetual care endowment. On September 28, 2008, ownership was transferred to the non-profit group, Friends of Falls of Clyde, which intends to restore the ship.

In October of that same year, the Bishop Museum was criticized for having raised $600,000 to preserve the ship, and spent only about half that on the ship, and that for sandblasting that was determined to damage the integrity of the vessel. The media also pointed out other questionable spending decisions.

<text>A bagad (, ) is a Breton band, composed of bagpipes (, ), bombards and drums (including snare, tenor and bass drums). The pipe band tradition in Brittany was inspired by the Scottish example and has developed since the mid-20th century. A bagad plays mainly Breton music, but a bagad&#x27;s music is evolutionary: new forms and musical ideas are experimented with at each annual national competition.

The plural for &quot;bagad&quot; is unusual in that many are referred to as &quot;bagadoù&quot; but for two, three or any other specified number they are simply referred to as &quot;bagad&quot; (following the rules of Breton grammar).

Every major town and city in Brittany has at least one &quot;bagad&quot; and there are over eighty in total. There are also many &quot;bagadoù&quot; outside Brittany, owing to large-scale Breton emigration throughout France. Bagad Lann Bihoue is well known to belong to the French Navy.

For competition purposes the &quot;bagadoù&quot; are ranked into five categories. Major competitions take place annually in Brest and in Lorient, where the National Championship takes place during the Interceltic Festival in August.

<text>In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise polynomial called a spline. That is, instead of fitting a single, high-degree polynomial to all of the values at once, spline interpolation fits low-degree polynomials to small subsets of the values, for example, fitting nine cubic polynomials between each of the pairs of ten points, instead of fitting a single degree-nine polynomial to all of them. Spline interpolation is often preferred over polynomial interpolation because the interpolation error can be made small even when using low-degree polynomials for the spline. Spline interpolation also avoids the problem of Runge&#x27;s phenomenon, in which oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using high-degree polynomials.

==Introduction==

Originally, &quot;spline&quot; was a term for rulers that were bent to pass through a number of predefined points, or &quot;knots&quot;. These were used to make technical drawings for shipbuilding and construction by hand, as illustrated in the figure.

We wish to model similar kinds of curves using a set of mathematical equations. Assume we have a sequence of formula_1 knots, formula_2 through formula_3. There will be a cubic polynomial formula_4 between each successive pair of knots formula_5 and formula_6 connecting to both of them, where formula_7. So there will be formula_8 polynomials, with the first polynomial starting at formula_2, and the last polynomial ending at formula_3.

The curvature of any curve formula_11 is defined as

:formula_12

where formula_13 and formula_14 are the first and second derivatives of formula_15 with respect to formula_16.
To make the spline take a shape that minimizes the bending (under the constraint of passing through all knots), we will define both formula_13 and formula_14 to be continuous everywhere, including at the knots. Each successive polynomial must have equal values (which are equal to the y-value of the corresponding datapoint), derivatives, and second derivatives at their joining knots, which is to say that

:formula_19

This can only be achieved if polynomials of degree 3 (cubic polynomials) or higher are used. The classical approach is to use polynomials of exactly degree 3 — cubic splines.

In addition to the three conditions above, a &quot;natural cubic spline&quot; has the condition that formula_20.

In addition to the three main conditions above, a &quot;clamped cubic spline&quot; has the conditions that formula_21 and formula_22 where formula_23 is the derivative of the interpolated function.

In addition to the three main conditions above, a &quot;not-a-knot spline&quot; has the conditions that formula_24 and formula_25.

==Algorithm to find the interpolating cubic spline==
We wish to find each polynomial formula_26 given the points formula_2 through formula_3. To do this, we will consider just a single piece of the curve, formula_29, which will interpolate from formula_30 to formula_31. This piece will have slopes formula_32 and formula_33 at its endpoints. Or, more precisely,

:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37

The full equation formula_29 can be written in the symmetrical form

where


But what are formula_32 and formula_33? To derive these critical values, we must consider that

:formula_41
It then follows that

 + \left(\frac{1}{x_i - x_{i-1}} + \frac{1}\right) 2k_i + \frac{k_{i+1}} = 3 \left(\frac{y_i - y_{i-1}}

Eventually, () together with () and () constitute linear equations that uniquely define the parameters .

There exist other end conditions, &quot;clamped spline&quot;, which specifies the slope at the ends of the spline, and the popular &quot;not-a-knot spline&quot;, which requires that the third derivative is also continuous at the and points.
For the &quot;not-a-knot&quot; spline, the additional equations will read:

:formula_42
:formula_43

where formula_44.

==Example==

In case of three points the values for formula_45 are found by solving the tridiagonal linear equation system
:formula_46
with
:formula_47
:formula_48
:formula_49
:formula_50
:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53
:formula_54
:formula_55
:formula_56

For the three points
:formula_57
one gets that
:formula_58
and from ({{EquationNote|10}}) and ({{EquationNote|11}}) that
:formula_59
:formula_60
:formula_61
:formula_62

In the figure, the spline function consisting of the two cubic polynomials formula_63 and formula_64 given by ({{EquationNote|9}}) is displayed.
