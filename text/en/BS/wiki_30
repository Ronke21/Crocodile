<text>Opera in German is that of the German-speaking countries, which include Germany, Austria, and the historic German states that pre-date those countries.

German-language opera appeared remarkably quickly after the birth of opera itself in Italy. The first Italian opera was Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; of 1598. In 1627, Heinrich Schütz provided the music for a German translation of the same libretto. Yet during much of the 17th and 18th centuries German-language opera would struggle to emerge from the shadow of its Italian-language rival, with leading composers from German-speaking parts of Europe, such as Handel and Gluck, opting to work in foreign traditions such as opera seria.

Some Baroque composers, such as Reinhard Keiser, did try to challenge Italian dominance, and the theatre principal Abel Seyler became an eager promoter of German opera in the 1770s, but it was only with the appearance of Mozart that a lasting tradition of serious German-language opera was established. Mozart took the simple, popular genre of &quot;Singspiel&quot; and turned it into something far more sophisticated. Beethoven followed his example with the idealistic &quot;Fidelio&quot;; and with &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; of 1821, Weber established a uniquely German form of opera under the influence of Romanticism. Weber&#x27;s innovations were eclipsed by those of Wagner, one of the most revolutionary and controversial figures in musical history. Wagner strove to achieve his ideal of opera as &quot;music drama&quot;, eliminating all distinction between aria and recitative, employing a complex web of leitmotifs and vastly increasing the power and richness of the orchestra. Wagner also drew on Germanic mythology in his huge operatic cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;.

After Wagner, opera could never be the same again, so great was his influence. The most successful of his followers was Richard Strauss. Opera flourished in German-speaking lands in the early 20th century in the hands of figures such as Hindemith, Busoni and Weill until Adolf Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power forced many composers into silence or exile. After World War II young opera writers were inspired by the example of Schoenberg and Berg who had pioneered modernist techniques such as atonality and serialism in the earlier decades of the century. Composers at work in the field of opera today include Hans Werner Henze.

As the names of Mozart, Weber, Wagner, Richard Strauss and Berg indicate, Germany and Austria have one of the strongest operatic traditions in European culture. This is also evidenced by the large number of opera houses, particularly in Germany where almost every major city has its own theatre for staging such works, as well as internationally renowned operatic events such as the Salzburg Festival.

==Baroque era==

===Birth===

The world&#x27;s first opera was &quot;Dafne&quot; by Jacopo Peri, which appeared in Florence in 1598. Three decades later Heinrich Schütz set the same libretto in a translation by the poet Martin Opitz, thus creating the first ever German-language opera. The music to Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; is now lost and details of the performance are sketchy, but it is known to have been written to celebrate the marriage of Landgrave Georg II of Hessen-Darmstadt to Princess Sophia Eleonora of Saxony in Torgau in 1627. As in Italy, the first patrons of opera in Germany and Austria were royalty and the nobility, and they tended to favour composers and singers from south of the Alps. Antonio Cesti was particularly successful, providing the huge operatic extravaganza &quot;Il pomo d&#x27;oro&quot; for the imperial court in Vienna in 1668. Opera in Italian would continue to exercise a considerable sway over German-speaking lands throughout the Baroque and Classical periods. Nevertheless, native forms were developing too. In Nuremberg in 1644, Sigmund Staden produced the &quot;spiritual pastorale&quot;, &quot;Seelewig&quot;, which foreshadows the &quot;Singspiel&quot;, a genre of German-language opera in which arias alternate with spoken dialogue. &quot;Seelewig&quot; was a moral allegory inspired by the example of contemporary school dramas and is the first German opera whose music has survived.

===Hamburg 1678–1738===
Another important development was the founding of the Theater am Gänsemarkt in Hamburg in 1678, aimed at the local middle classes who preferred opera in their own language. The new opera house opened with a performance of Johann Theile&#x27;s &quot;Der erschaffene, gefallene und aufgerichtete Mensch&quot;, based on the story of Adam and Eve. The theatre, however, would come to be dominated by the works of Reinhard Keiser, an enormously prolific composer who wrote over a hundred operas, sixty of them for Hamburg. Initially, the works performed in Hamburg had all been on religious themes in an attempt to ward off criticisms by Pietist church authorities that the theatre was immoral, but Keiser and fellow composers such as Johann Mattheson broadened the range of subject matter to include the historical and the mythological. Keiser drew on foreign operatic traditions, for instance he included dances after the model of the French tradition of Lully. The recitative in his operas was always in German so the audience could follow the plot, but from &quot;Claudius&quot; in 1703 he began to include arias in Italian which allowed for florid vocal display. The hallmark of the Hamburg style was its eclecticism. &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1726) by Telemann contains arias in Italian setting texts taken from famous Handel operas as well as choruses in French to words originally set by Lully. Hamburg opera might also include comic characters (Keiser&#x27;s &quot;Der Carneval von Venedig&quot; of 1707 has them speaking in the local Lower Saxon dialect), marking a great contrast to the elevated new style of opera seria as defined by Metastasio. Yet the immediate future belonged to Italian opera. The most famous German-born opera composer of the era, Handel, wrote four operas for Hamburg at the beginning of his career but soon moved on to write opera seria in Italy and England. In 1738, the Theater am Gänsemarkt went bankrupt and the fortunes of serious opera in German went into decline for the next few decades.

Other early opera houses in Germany included the Oper am Brühl in Leipzig and the Opernhaus vorm Salztor in Naumburg in 1701. Both played during the trade fairs in the towns, presenting both German and Italian opera, and a combination of both. While the house in Leipzig was financed by the town of Leipzig, the house in Naumburg was initiated and supported by the ruler, Moritz Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Zeitz, but offered public performances.

===&quot;Opera seria&quot;, &quot;Singspiel&quot;, melodrama, early serious German opera===

The other leading German composers of the time tended to follow Handel&#x27;s example. This was because the courts of the various German states favoured opera in Italian. In 1730 the chief proponent of opera seria, the Italian librettist Metastasio, took up residence as the imperial poet in Vienna. Johann Adolph Hasse wrote operas in Italian for the court of the Elector of Saxony in Dresden. Hasse also wrote operas for the court of Frederick the Great in Berlin, as did Carl Heinrich Graun. The king himself supplied the libretto for Graun&#x27;s &quot;Montezuma&quot;, first performed in 1755.
Deprived of aristocratic patronage until the mid-1770s, opera in German was forced to look to the general public to survive. This meant theatrical companies had to tour from town to town. The &quot;Singspiel&quot; became the most popular form of German opera, especially in the hands of the composer Johann Adam Hiller. Hiller&#x27;s 1766 reworking of the &quot;Singspiel Die verwandelten Weiber&quot; was a landmark in the history of the genre, although his most famous work would be &quot;Die Jagd&quot; (1770). These &quot;Singspiele&quot; were comedies mixing spoken dialogue and singing, influenced by the similar genres of the ballad opera in England and the opéra comique in France. Often having sentimental plots and extremely simple music, &quot;Singspiele&quot; were no match for contemporary opera serias in artistic sophistication.

The 1770s marked an important decade in the history of German-language opera. The theatre company of Abel Seyler pioneered serious German-language opera, and Seyler commissioned operas by Hiller, Georg Benda, Anton Schweitzer and other composers. A milestone of German opera was Anton Schweitzer&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;, with a libretto by Wieland and commissioned by Seyler, which premiered in 1773 in Weimar. &quot;Alceste&quot; was called &quot;a model for German opera&quot; by Ernst Christoph Dressler and has been described as the first serious German opera. It was also in the 1770s that composers, like Georg Benda, began experimenting with melodrama, a type of music theatre which some commentators saw as a viable alternative to opera. Early melodramas that proved popular with theatre troupes throughout German-speaking Europe included Benda&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot; (both premiered in 1775). Other important contributions to a growing repertoire of German operas appeared shortly after. This includes &quot;Günther von Schwarzburg&quot;, a through-composed opera noted then as now for its topic taken from German history, by composer Ignaz Holzbauer and librettist Anton Klein which premiered in 1777. An increasing amount of operas originally set to Italian and French texts by composers like André Ernest Modeste Grétry were translated and adopted for performance in German. By the end of the decade, German opera could be heard throughout Central Europe owing in part to travelling theatres and German states that began supporting &quot;Nationaltheater&quot; that further developed the repertoire, such as those founded in Mannheim and Vienna. Alongside those already mentioned above, notable composers of German-language opera from the 1770s and 1780s include Johann André, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, Christian Gottlob Neefe, Ignaz Umlauf, and Ernst Wilhelm Wolf. With successful works that appeared on stages across Germany, like &quot;Der Doktor und Apotheker&quot;, Ditters was a particularly successful composer of German opera between the mid-1780s and mid-1790s.

==Classical era==

===Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Singspiele&quot;===

At the end of the 18th century, a composer who would permanently change the German operatic tradition would emerge: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The great figure of the early Classical period was Christoph Willibald Gluck but his pioneering reforms were directed at Italian and French opera, not the German repertoire. In 1778, Emperor Joseph II attempted to change this state of affairs by establishing a German-language opera troupe, the National Singspiel, at the Burgtheater in Vienna. The experiment was short-lived and the troupe was dissolved in 1783, yet the previous year it had produced one undoubted success with &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; by the young Mozart. Goethe immediately recognised the quality of the piece, declaring &quot;it knocked us all sideways&quot;. In the following years commercial theatres sprang up in Vienna offering German-language opera. The impresario Emanuel Schikaneder had particular success with his Theater auf der Wieden on the outskirts of the city. In 1791, Mozart set one of his libretti, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Although it appeared in the context of other popular Viennese magic operas (&quot;Zauberopern&quot;), like Wenzel Müller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s proved to be no ordinary &quot;Singspiel&quot;. Though the traditional farcical elements remained, Mozart added a new seriousness, particularly in the music for Sarastro and his priests. Even more than &quot;Die Entführung&quot;, the &quot;Magic Flute&quot; pointed the way forward for future German opera, especially according to later commentators.

===Beethoven and &quot;Fidelio&quot;===
The greatest German composer of the next generation, Beethoven, seized on &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;&#x27;s blend of domestic comedy and high seriousness for his only opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, the story of a devoted wife who saves her husband from political imprisonment. The years following the French Revolution of 1789 had been some of the most turbulent in European history. In &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Beethoven wanted to express the ideals of that Revolution: liberty, equality and fraternity. He was also inspired by contemporary French works, particularly the rescue operas of Luigi Cherubini. Beethoven was arguably not a natural composer of opera and, although &quot;Fidelio&quot; was premiered in 1805, it was not until 1814 that he produced its final version. Nevertheless, Fidelio is widely regarded as a masterpiece and is one of the key works in the German repertoire.

==German Romantic opera==

===Early Romanticism===
In the early years of the nineteenth century, the vast cultural movement known as Romanticism began to exert an influence over German composers. The Romantics showed a keen interest in the Middle Ages as well as German folklore. The fairy tale collections of the Brothers Grimm and the rediscovered Medieval German epic the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; were major sources of inspiration for the movement. There was also often a quest for a distinctively German identity, influenced by the new nationalism which had arisen in the wake of the Napoleonic invasions. Romanticism was already firmly established in German literature with writers such as Tieck, Novalis, Eichendorff and Clemens Brentano. One of the most famous German Romantic authors, E. T. A. Hoffmann, was also a music theorist and a composer in his own right and in 1816 he produced an opera, &quot;Undine&quot;, in Berlin. Another important early Romantic opera was &quot;Faust&quot; by Louis Spohr (also 1816). Both Hoffmann and Spohr took the basic form of the &quot;Singspiel&quot; as their starting point but began to group the individual numbers into extended scenes. They also employed &quot;reminiscence motifs&quot;, recurring musical themes associated with characters or concepts in the opera, which would pave the way for Wagner&#x27;s use of the leitmotif.

===Weber===

The major breakthrough in the history of German Romantic opera was &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; by Carl Maria von Weber, premiered in Berlin on 18 June 1821. Weber resented the Europe-wide dominance of the Italian operas of Rossini and wanted to establish a uniquely German style of opera. He turned to German folk songs and folklore for inspiration; &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; is based on a tale from the &quot;Gespensterbuch&quot; (&quot;Book of Wraiths&quot;) of Apel and Laun concerning a marksman who makes a pact with the Devil. Weber&#x27;s strong point was his striking ability to evoke atmosphere through orchestral colour. From the very first bars of the overture, it is obvious we are in the primeval forests of Germany. The highlight of the opera is the chilling Wolf&#x27;s Glen Scene in which the hero Max makes his deal with the Devil. &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; was immensely popular, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe. Weber never really achieved his full potential as an opera composer due to his early death from tuberculosis and his poor choice of libretti. His major German opera after &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, &quot;Euryanthe&quot; (1823), suffers from a particularly weak text and is rarely staged nowadays. Yet &quot;Euryanthe&quot; marks another important stage in the development of serious German opera. Weber completely eliminated spoken dialogue, producing a &quot;through-composed&quot; work where the distinction between recitative and aria is becoming blurred. Its lessons would not be lost on future composers, including Richard Wagner.

===Other composers of the time===
Weber&#x27;s most important successor in the field of Romantic opera was Heinrich Marschner, who further explored the Gothic and the supernatural in works such as &quot;Der Vampyr&quot; (1828) and &quot;Hans Heiling&quot; (1833). On the other hand, it was with comic opera that Albert Lortzing scored his biggest successes. The popularity of pieces such as &quot;Zar und Zimmermann&quot; continues in Germany today, though Lortzing&#x27;s operas are rarely staged abroad. Though he began in Germany, Giacomo Meyerbeer was more famous for his contributions to Italian and (especially) French opera. He fused elements from all three national styles into his conception of grand opera, which had an important influence on the development of German music, including Wagner&#x27;s early works. Other notable operas of the time include &quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot; (1849) by Otto Nicolai and &quot;Martha&quot; (1847) by Friedrich von Flotow. Later came Peter Cornelius (&quot;Der Barbier von Bagdad&quot;, 1858), Hermann Goetz (&quot;Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung&quot;, 1874) and Karl Goldmark (&quot;Die Königin von Saba&quot;, 1875).

Mention should be made of two great composers of the era who wrote their major works in other genres yet also composed operas: Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann. Schubert wrote over a dozen operas, mostly in the &quot;Singspiel&quot; style. Hardly any were performed during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. Schumann only wrote one opera, &quot;Genoveva&quot;, first staged in Leipzig in 1850. Though praised by Liszt, it failed to win lasting success. The verdict on both these composer&#x27;s operas has generally been that, though they contain excellent music, they have too many dramatic weaknesses to be acclaimed as great stage works.

==Wagner==

Richard Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history and his innovations changed the course of opera, not just in Germany and Austria but throughout Europe. Wagner gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a (a &quot;complete work of art&quot;), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. His earliest experiments followed the examples set by Weber () and Meyerbeer (), but his most important formative influence was probably the symphonic music of Beethoven. Wagner believed his career truly began with (1843). Together with the two works which followed, and , this has been described as the &quot;zenith of German Romantic opera&quot;. Yet these were merely a prelude to even more radical developments. In his mature dramas, , , and , Wagner abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of &quot;endless melody&quot;. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of leitmotifs; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as tonality, in his quest for greater expressivity. Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from Germanic or Arthurian legend. Finally, Wagner built his own opera house at Bayreuth, exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.

==Late Romantic opera==

===After Wagner===
Wagner&#x27;s innovations cast an immense shadow over subsequent composers, who struggled to absorb his influence while retaining their own individuality. One of the most successful composers of the following generation was Humperdinck, whose &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot; (1893) still has an assured place in the standard repertoire. Humperdinck turned back to folk song and the tales of the Brothers Grimm for inspiration. Yet, though &quot;Hänsel&quot; is often viewed as the ideal piece for introducing opera to children, it also has extraordinarily sophisticated orchestration and makes great use of leitmotifs, both tell-tale signs of Wagner&#x27;s influence.

Other composers of the era who tried their hand at opera include Hugo Wolf (&quot;Der Corregidor&quot;, 1896) and Wagner&#x27;s own son Siegfried.

===Richard Strauss===

Richard Strauss was heavily influenced by Wagner, despite his father&#x27;s efforts to the contrary. By seventeen, he was unimpressed with &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot; but absolutely entranced by the other three pieces of the &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Although in his early years he was more famous for his orchestral tone poems, &quot;Salome&quot; (1905) and &quot;Elektra&quot; (1909) quickly established his reputation as Germany&#x27;s leading opera composer. These two operas stretched the tonal music system to its breaking point. The highly chromatic music featured harsh dissonances and unresolved harmonies. This, paired with the gruesome subject matter, looked forward to expressionism. &quot;Elektra&quot; also marked the beginning of Strauss&#x27;s working relationship with the leading Austrian poet and playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal, who would provide another five libretti for the composer. With &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; of 1911, Strauss changed direction, looking towards Mozart and the world of the Viennese waltz as much as towards Wagner. Modernist critics accused him of &quot;selling out&quot;, but &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; proved an immense success with audiences around the world. Strauss continued to ignore critical fashion, producing the mixture of farce and high tragedy of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, the complex allegory of &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, the domestic dramas of &quot;Intermezzo&quot; and &quot;Arabella&quot;, and the mythological &quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot; and &quot;Daphne&quot;. Strauss bid farewell to the musical stage with &quot;Capriccio&quot; of 1942, a &quot;conversation piece&quot; which explores the relationship between words and music in opera.

===Other late Romantics===
Other composers styled &quot;late Romantic&quot;, such as Franz Schreker (&quot;Der ferne Klang&quot;, 1912; &quot;Der Schatzgräber&quot;, 1920), Alexander von Zemlinsky (&quot;Eine florentinische Tragödie&quot;, 1917; &quot;Der Zwerg&quot;, 1922) and Erich Korngold (&quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;, 1920) explored similar territory to Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot;. They combined Wagnerian influences, lush orchestration, strange harmonies and dissonances with &quot;decadent&quot; subject matter reflecting the dominance of Expressionism in the arts and the contemporary psychological explorations of Sigmund Freud. All three composers suffered persecution and eclipse under the Nazis, who condemned their works as &quot;entartete Musik&quot; (&quot;degenerate music&quot;). Hans Pfitzner was another late Romantic post-Wagnerian, albeit of a more conservative stripe. His major opera &quot;Palestrina&quot; (1917) makes the case for tradition and inspiration rather than musical modernism.

===Heyday of operetta===
In the late nineteenth century, a new, lighter form of opera, operetta, became popular in Vienna. Operettas had immediately attractive tunes, comic (and often frivolous) plots and used spoken dialogue between the musical &quot;numbers&quot;. Viennese operetta was inspired by the fashion for the French operettas of Jacques Offenbach. &quot;&quot; (1860) by Franz von Suppé is generally regarded as the first important operetta in the German language, but by far the most famous example of the genre is &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1874) by Johann Strauss. Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1905) and Emmerich Kálmán&#x27;s &quot;Die Csárdásfürstin&quot; (1915) were other massive hits. Other composers who worked in this style include Oscar Straus and Sigmund Romberg.

==Modernism: Second Viennese School==
Following the example of Wagner, Richard Strauss, Zemlinsky and Schreker had pushed traditional tonality to the absolute limits. Now a new group of composers appeared in Vienna who wanted to take music beyond. Operatic modernism truly began in the operas of two composers of the so-called Second Viennese School, Arnold Schoenberg and his acolyte Alban Berg, both advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), dodecaphony. Schoenberg&#x27;s early musico-dramatic works, &quot;Erwartung&quot; (1909, premiered in 1924) and &quot;Die glückliche Hand&quot; display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used Sprechstimme, which he described as: &quot;The voice rising and falling relative to the indicated intervals, and everything being bound together with the time and rhythm of the music except where a pause is indicated&quot;. Schoenberg intended &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; as his operatic masterpiece, but it was left unfinished at his death.

The two operas of Schoenberg&#x27;s pupil Alban Berg, &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot; (left incomplete at his death) share many of the same characteristics described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character). This perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots.

==1918–1945: Weimar Germany, Inter-war Austria, Third Reich==
The years following World War I saw German and Austrian culture flourishing in spite of the surrounding political turmoil. Late Romantic composers were still at work alongside the avowed modernists Schoenberg and Berg. The Italian-born Ferruccio Busoni ploughed an individual furrow, attempting to fuse Bach and the avant-garde, Mediterranean and Germanic culture in his music. He never lived to finish his most significant opera &quot;Doktor Faust&quot; (1925). Paul Hindemith began his operatic career with short, scandalous pieces such as &quot;Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen&quot; (&quot;Murder, Hope of Women&quot;) before turning to Bach, as Busoni had done. Hindemith saw Bach-inspired &quot;neo-classicism&quot; as a way of curbing the excesses of late Romanticism. &quot;Cardillac&quot; (1925) was his first work in this vein. Hindemith was also interested in putting contemporary life on the stage in his operas (a concept called &quot;Zeitoper&quot;), as was Ernst Krenek whose &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot; (1927) has a jazz violinist as its hero. Kurt Weill reflected life in Weimar Germany in a more overtly political way. His most famous collaboration with Bertolt Brecht, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1928), was both a scandal and an immense box-office success.

Adolf Hitler&#x27;s assumption of power destroyed this thriving operatic scene. Ironically, after the burning of the Reichstag in 1933, the German seat of the government was moved to the Kroll Opera House, the state opera house in Berlin which, under the adventurous directorship of Otto Klemperer, had seen the premieres of many innovative works of the 1920s, including Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Neues vom Tage&quot;. Now Hindemith responded to the advent of the Third Reich with his chief work &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;, a portrait of an artist trying to survive in hostile times. It received its premiere in Zürich in 1938, since all performances of Hindemith&#x27;s music had been banned in Germany the previous year. In 1940, Hindemith left Switzerland for the United States, joining a transatlantic exodus of composers which included Schoenberg, Weill, Korngold and Zemlinsky. Schreker had died in 1934, having been dismissed from his teaching post by the Nazis; other composers, such as the promising Viktor Ullmann, would perish in the death camps. Some opera composers, including Carl Orff, Werner Egk and the ageing Richard Strauss, remained in Germany to accommodate with the new regime as best they could.

==Since 1945==
Composers writing after World War II had to find a way of coming to terms with the destruction caused by the Third Reich. The modernism of Schoenberg and Berg proved attractive to young composers, since their works had been banned by the Nazis and were free of any taint of the former regime. Bernd Alois Zimmermann looked to the example of Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; for his only opera &quot;Die Soldaten&quot; (1965), and Aribert Reimann continued the tradition of expressionism with his Shakespearean &quot;Lear&quot; (1978). Perhaps the most versatile and internationally famous post-war German opera composer is Hans Werner Henze, who has produced a series of works which mix Bergian influences with those of Italian composers such as Verdi. Examples of his operas are &quot;Boulevard Solitude&quot;, &quot;The Bassarids&quot; (to a libretto by W. H. Auden) and &quot;Das verratene Meer&quot;. Karlheinz Stockhausen set off in an even more avant-garde direction with his enormous operatic cycle based on the seven days of the week, &quot;Licht&quot; (1977–2003). Giselher Klebe created an extensive body of work in the operatic genre based on literary works. Other leading composers still producing operas today include Wolfgang Rihm and Olga Neuwirth.

<text>Edward Trowbridge Collins Sr. (May 2, 1887 – March 25, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Cocky&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, manager and executive. He played as a second baseman in Major League Baseball from to for the Philadelphia Athletics and Chicago White Sox. A graduate of Columbia University, Collins holds major league career records in several categories and is among the top few players in several other categories. In 1925, Collins became just the sixth person to join the 3,000 hit club – and the last for the next 17 seasons. His 47 career home runs are the fewest of anyone in it. Collins is the only non-Yankee to win five or more World Series titles with the same club as a player. He is also the only player to have been a member of all five World Series championships won by the Athletics during the franchise&#x27;s time in Philadelphia.

Collins coached and managed in the major leagues after retiring as a player. He also served as general manager of the Boston Red Sox. In 1939, Collins was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Edward Trowbridge Collins Sr. was born on May 2, 1887, in Millerton, New York, a 384-acre village in Dutchess County, New York.

==College career==
Collins was an Ivy League graduate who was notable for his offensive skill set and base-stealing capabilities. He graduated from Columbia University (where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity) at a time when few major league players had attended college.

He started his professional baseball career on September 17, 1906, when he signed with the Philadelphia Athletics organization at the age of 19. At the time of his signing, Collins was still a student at Columbia, and he played some of his early minor league games under the last name of Sullivan so that he could protect his collegiate status. Collins had lost his collegiate eligibility when it was discovered he played with Plattsburgh and Rutland in the 1906 Northern Independent League. He then signed with the Athletics and made his debut.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Athletics (1906–1914)===

After spending all but 14 games of the 1907 season in the minor leagues, he played in 102 games in 1908 and by 1909 was a full-time player. That season, he registered a .347 batting average and 67 steals. He was also named the A&#x27;s starting second baseman in 1909, a position he played for the rest of his career, after seeing time at second, third, shortstop, and the outfield the previous two seasons. In 1910, Collins stole a career-high 81 bases, the first American League player to steal at least 80 bases in a season, and played on the first of his six World Series championship teams.

Collins ranks 11th in the major leagues for most hits of all time with 3,315, and 7th for most stolen bases of all time with 745. He is one of five players to steal six bases in a game, and the only person to do so twice, with both occurrences happening within eleven days, on September 11 and September 22, 1912, respectively. He was part of the Athletics&#x27; &quot;$100,000 infield&quot; (and the highest-paid of the quartet) which propelled the team to four American League (AL) pennants and three World Series titles between 1910 and 1914. He earned the league&#x27;s Chalmers Award (early Most Valuable Player recognition) in .

In 1913, the Federal League formed as a direct competitor to the American League. To retain Collins, Athletics manager Connie Mack offered his second baseman the longest guaranteed contract (five years) that had ever been offered to a player. Collins declined, and after the 1914 season Mack sold Collins to the White Sox for $50,000, the highest price ever paid for a player up to that point and the first of only three times that a reigning MVP was sold or traded (the others being Alex Rodriguez in 2003 and Giancarlo Stanton in 2017, both to the New York Yankees). The Sox paid Collins $15,000 for 1915, making him the third highest paid player in the league, behind Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker.

===Chicago White Sox (1915–1926)===
In Chicago, Collins continued to post top-ten batting and stolen base numbers, and he helped the Sox capture pennants in 1917 and 1919. He was part of the notorious &quot;Black Sox&quot; team that threw the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Collins was not accused of being part of the conspiracy and was considered to have played honestly, his low .226 batting average notwithstanding. Years later, Collins would say he had no pity for the eight players who were banished because he said they knew what they were doing.

In August , he was named player-manager of the White Sox and held the position through the season, posting a record of 174–160 (.521). His two full seasons were the only winning seasons enjoyed by the White Sox from 1921 to 1936.

On June 3, 1925, he collected the 3,000th hit of his career to become the sixth player in major league history to join the 3,000 hit club, doing so for the White Sox off pitcher Rip Collins of the Detroit Tigers at Navin Field on a single. Incidentally, this was also the first game in which there were two members of the 3,000 hit club playing in the same game, as Ty Cobb played center field.

===Return to the Athletics (1927–1930)===
Collins returned to Philadelphia to rejoin the Athletics in as a player-coach. For all intents and purposes, 1927 was his last year as a full-time player; he only played in 48 games in the following three years, mostly as a pinch hitter. The A&#x27;s won the World Series in 1929 and 1930, but Collins didn&#x27;t play in either. His last appearance as a player was on August 2, 1930.

Collins finished his career with 1,300 runs batted in. To date, Collins is the only major league player to play for two teams for at least 12 seasons each. Upon his retirement, he ranked second in major league history in career games (2,826), walks (1,499) and stolen bases (744), third in runs scored (1,821), fourth in hits (3,315) and at bats (9,949), sixth in on-base percentage (.424), and eighth in total bases (4,268); he was also fourth in AL history in triples (187).

He still holds the major league record of 512 career sacrifice bunts, over 100 more than any other player. He was the first major leaguer in modern history to steal 80 bases in a season, and still shares the major league record of six steals in a game, which he accomplished twice in September 1912. He regularly batted over .320, retiring with a career average of .333. He also holds major league records for career games (2,650), assists (7,630) and total chances (14,591) at second base, and ranks second in putouts (6,526). Collins is one of only 31 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades.

==Front-office career==
Following the A&#x27;s 1930 World Series victory, Collins retired as a player and immediately stepped into a full-time position as a coach with the A&#x27;s.

After two seasons as a coach, Collins was hired as vice president and general manager of the Boston Red Sox. The new owner, Tom Yawkey, was a close friend who had attended the same prep school as Collins. Yawkey actually bought the Red Sox at Collins&#x27; suggestion. He assumed management of a team that had bottomed out from a long decline dating from their sale of Babe Ruth; the 1932 Red Sox finished 43–111, the worst record in franchise history.

In 1933, under Collins’ leadership, the Red Sox became the first team to field a Mexican-born player in the major leagues, Mel Almada.

Collins remained general manager through the 1947 season, retiring at age 60 after a period of declining health, thus ending 41 years in baseball. During his 15 years as general manager, Collins signed future Hall of Famers such as Joe Cronin, Ted Williams, and Bobby Doerr.

Collins managed winning seasons in seven of his final twelve years as general manager. Under Collins&#x27; leadership, the Red Sox won the 1946 pennant, their first in 28 years. After his death in 1951, the Red Sox hung a plaque outside Fenway Park in honor of Collins. In May 2018, the Red Sox removed the plaque, reportedly due to the team not integrating Black players before the end of his tenure in 1947. Of the 16 major league teams at the time, the Dodgers, Browns, and Indians were the only three that were integrated by the 1947 season.

Collins was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.

He struggled with major heart problems for several years at the end of his life. He was admitted to a hospital in Boston on March 10, 1951, and died there due to a heart condition on March 25 at age 63.

===Managerial record===
==Legacy==
In 1999, Collins was ranked number 24 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. He played on a total of six World Series-winning teams (1910, 1911, 1913, 1917, 1929, and 1930), though he did not participate in any of the final two series&#x27; games.

Under the win shares statistical rating system created by baseball historian and analyst Bill James, Collins was the greatest second baseman of all time.

His son, Eddie Jr., was an outfielder who played for Yale University. He briefly saw major league action (in 1939 and 1941–42, all with the A&#x27;s) and later worked in the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; front office.

<doc id="542054" wikidata="Q902090" url="?curid=542054" title="Coefficient of performance">
<text>The coefficient of performance or COP (sometimes CP or CoP) of a heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system is a ratio of useful heating or cooling provided to work (energy) required. Higher COPs equate to higher efficiency, lower energy (power) consumption and thus lower operating costs. The COP is used in thermodynamics.

The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because instead of just converting work to heat (which, if 100% efficient, would be a COP of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required. Most air conditioners have a COP of 3.5 to 5. Less work is required to move heat than for conversion into heat, and because of this, heat pumps, air conditioners and refrigeration systems can have a coefficient of performance greater than one. 

The COP is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions. 

Performance of absorption refrigerator chillers is typically much lower, as they are not heat pumps relying on compression, but instead rely on chemical reactions driven by heat.

== Equation ==
The equation is:
:formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the useful heat supplied or removed by the considered system (machine).
* formula_3 is the net work put into the considered system in one cycle.

The COP for heating and cooling are different because the heat reservoir of interest is different. When one is interested in how well a machine cools, the COP is the ratio of the heat taken up from the cold reservoir to input work. However, for heating, the COP is the ratio of the magnitude of the heat given off to the hot reservoir (which is the heat taken up from the cold reservoir plus the input work) to the input work:
:formula_4

:formula_5
where
*formula_6 is the heat flow from the cold reservoir to the system; since heat is being extracted from the cold reservoir, this value is positive.
*formula_7 is the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the system; since heat is being sunk into the hot reservoir, this value is negative. (see heat).

Note that the COP of a heat pump depends on its direction. The heat rejected to the hot sink is greater than the heat absorbed from the cold source, so the heating COP is greater by one than the cooling COP.

==Theoretical performance limits==
According to the first law of thermodynamics, after a full cycle of the process formula_8 and thus formula_9.&lt;br&gt;
Since formula_10, we obtain
:formula_11

For a heat pump operating at maximum theoretical efficiency (i.e. Carnot efficiency), it can be shown that 
:formula_12 and thus formula_13
where formula_14 and formula_15 are the thermodynamic temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs, respectively.

At maximum theoretical efficiency, therefore
:formula_16
which is equal to the reciprocal of the thermal efficiency of an ideal heat engine, because a heat pump is a heat engine operating in reverse.

Similarly, the COP of a refrigerator or air conditioner operating at maximum theoretical efficiency,
:formula_17

formula_18 applies to heat pumps and formula_19 applies to air conditioners and refrigerators. 
Measured values for actual systems will always be significantly less than these theoretical maxima.

In Europe, the standard test conditions for ground source heat pump units use 308 K (35 °C; 95 °F) for formula_20 and 273 K (0 °C; 32 °F) for formula_21. According to the above formula, the maximum theoretical COPs would be &lt;br&gt;
:formula_22&lt;br&gt;
:formula_23

Test results of the best systems are around 4.5. When measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems, seasonal COP&#x27;s for heating are around 3.5 or less. This indicates room for further improvement.

The EU standard test conditions for an air source heat pump is at dry-bulb temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) for formula_20 and 7 °C (44.6 °F) for formula_21. Given sub-zero European winter temperatures, real world heating performance is significantly poorer than such standard COP figures imply.

==Improving the COP==
As the formula shows, the COP of a heat pump system can be improved by reducing the temperature gap formula_26 at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things:

# Reducing the output temperature to around which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to air heaters. 
# Increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank ). 

Accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop or borehole sizing, resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system. For an air cooler, the COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing the temperature drop on the output side by increasing the air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of the fluid, which in turn lowers the Reynolds number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see hydraulic head). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing the size of the internal heat exchangers, which in turn increases the efficiency (and the cost) relative to the power of the compressor, and also by reducing the system&#x27;s internal temperature gap over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes some heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures, which means that a separate machine is needed for producing, e.g., hot tap water.

The COP of absorption chillers can be improved by adding a second or third stage. Double and triple effect chillers are significantly more efficient than single effect chillers, and can surpass a COP of 1. They require higher pressure and higher temperature steam, but this is still a relatively small 10 pounds of steam per hour per ton of cooling.

== Seasonal efficiency ==
A realistic indication of energy efficiency over an entire year can be achieved by using seasonal COP or seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) for heat. Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) is mostly used for air conditioning. SCOP is a new methodology which gives a better indication of expected real-life performance of heat pump technology.

<text>Alexander Konstantin von Oettingen (, Wissust Manor, Wissust () – Yuryev ()) was a Baltic German Lutheran theologian and statistician.

==Biography==
Oettingen was born at Wissust (now in Jõgeva Parish) in the Kreis Dorpat of the Governorate of Livonia, the member of a Baltic German noble family that produced many scholars, including his brothers Georg von Oettingen, professor of medicine at the University of Dorpat (), and Arthur von Oettingen, professor of physique in Dorpat and Leipzig. Alexander von Oettingen studied at Erlangen, Bonn, and Berlin.

From 1854 to 1891, Oettingen was professor of dogmatics at the University of Dorpat and, theologically, a typical representative of this ultra-orthodox and conservative Lutheran department. While his theological works are forgotten, his side-interest in statistics (and the then-very fashionable view that statistical predictability of social behavior left no space for ethics or God), and discussions with the then-very deterministically-minded great economist Adolph Wagner let him write a very important work, the &quot;Moralstatistik&quot; (&quot;Moral Statistics&quot;), in 1868. Oettingen makes the point that there is regularity in human action because of human societal living together but that there is freedom of action of the individual &quot;because the regularity of moral statistical numbers is never absolute&quot;. (R. v. Engelhardt)

With the book, and in its subtitle, Oettingen also coined the word, and established the concept, of &quot;Sozialethik&quot; (&quot;Social Ethics&quot;), meant as a counter to Auguste Comte&#x27;s &quot;social physics&quot; concept and as the establishment of a non-personal, non-individualistic ethics; this is what Protestant ethics as taught in German universities is still called.

<doc id="542071" wikidata="Q158597" url="?curid=542071" title="Anopheles">
<text>Anopheles () is a genus of mosquito first described by the German entomologist J. W. Meigen in 1818, and are known as nail mosquitoes and marsh mosquitoes. Many such mosquitoes are vectors of the parasite &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, a genus of protozoans that cause malaria in birds, reptiles, and mammals, including humans. The &quot;Anopheles gambiae&quot; mosquito is the best-known species of marsh mosquito that transmits the &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, which is a malarial parasite deadly to human beings; no other mosquito genus is a vector of human malaria.

The genus &quot;Anopheles&quot; diverged from other mosquitoes approximately (mya), and, like other mosquitoes, the eggs, larvae, and pupae are aquatic. The &quot;Anopheles&quot; larva has no respiratory siphon through which to breathe, so it breathes and feeds with its body horizontal to the surface of the water. The adult mosquito hatches from the surface and feeds on the nectar of flowers; the female mosquito also feeds on blood, which animal diet allows them to carry and transmit parasites between hosts. The adult&#x27;s feeding position is head-down, unlike the horizontal stance of the culicines. &quot;Anopheles&quot; are distributed almost worldwide, throughout the tropics, the subtropics, and the temperate regions of planet Earth. In hot weather, adult &quot;Anopheles&quot; aestivate, which is a state of dormancy that enables the mosquito to survive in hot dry regions, such as the Sahel.

== Evolution ==
=== Fossil history ===
Fossils of the genus &quot;Anopheles&quot; are rare; only two had been found by 2015. They are &quot;Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) dominicanus&quot; in Dominican Republic amber from the Late Eocene ( to ), and &quot;Anopheles rottensis&quot; in German amber from the Late Oligocene ( to ).

=== Phylogeny ===

The ancestors of all flies including mosquitoes appeared . The culicine and &quot;Anopheles&quot; clades of mosquitoes diverged between and . The Old and New World &quot;Anopheles&quot; species subsequently diverged between and . &quot;Anopheles darlingi&quot; diverged from the African and Asian malaria vectors ~. The cladogram is based on an analysis of mosquito genomes by Heafsey and colleagues in 2015:

=== Taxonomy ===

The genus name &quot;Anopheles&quot; was introduced by the German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1818. He described two species, &quot;A. birfurcatus&quot; and the type species, &quot;Anopheles maculipennis&quot;. He stated that the name meant , &quot;burdensome&quot;. The name comes from the Ancient Greek word &#x27;useless&#x27;, derived from , &#x27;not&#x27;, &#x27;un-&#x27; and &#x27;profit&#x27;.

The taxonomy of the genus was greatly advanced in 1901 when the English entomologist Frederick Vincent Theobald described 39 &quot;Anopheles&quot; species in his 5-volume monograph on the Culicidae. He was provided with mosquito specimens sent in to the British Museum (Natural History) from around the world, on the 1898 instruction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain.

&quot;Anopheles&quot; (with a nearly worldwide distribution) belongs to the subfamily Anophelinae alongside two other genera: &quot;Bironella&quot; (restricted to Australia) and &quot;Chagasia&quot; (restricted to the Neotropics). The taxonomy remains incompletely settled. Classification into species is based on morphological characteristics – wing spots, head anatomy, larval and pupal anatomy, chromosome structure, and more recently, on DNA sequences. In the taxonomy published by Harbach and Kitching in 2016, it was shown that three species of &quot;Bironella&quot; (&quot;B. confusa&quot;, &quot;B. gracilis,&quot; and &quot;B. hollandi&quot;) are phylogenetically more similar to &quot;A. kyondawensis&quot; than other &quot;Bironella&quot; species. That phylogeny argues that, based on genetic similarity, &quot;A. implexus&quot; is divergent from the common ancestor of &quot;Anopheles&quot;.

Like all mosquitoes, anophelines go through four stages in their life cycles: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The first three stages are aquatic and together last 5–14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature. The adult stage is when the female &quot;Anopheles&quot; acts as malaria vector. The adult females can live up to a month (or more in captivity), but most probably do not live more than two weeks in nature.

=== Eggs ===

Adult females lay 50–200 eggs per oviposition. The eggs are quite small (about × ). Eggs are laid singly and directly on water. They are unique in that they have floats on either side. Eggs are not resistant to drying and hatch within 2–3 days, although hatching may take up to 2–3 weeks in colder climates.

=== Larvae ===

The mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large thorax and a nine-segment abdomen. It has no legs. In contrast to other mosquitoes, the &quot;Anopheles&quot; larva lacks a respiratory siphon, so it positions itself so that its body is parallel to the surface of the water. In contrast, the feeding larva of culicine mosquitoes attach themselves to the water surface with the posterior siphon, the body pointing downwards. Larvae breathe through spiracles located on the eighth abdominal segment and so must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms in the thin surface layer. They dive below the surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either by jerky movements of the entire body or through propulsion with the mouth brushes.

Larvae develop through four stages, or instars, after which they metamorphose into pupae. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their exoskeletons, or skin, to allow for further growth. The larvae occur in a wide range of habitats, but most species prefer clean, unpolluted water. Larvae of &quot;Anopheles&quot; have been found in freshwater or saltwater marshes, mangrove swamps, rice fields, grassy ditches, the edges of streams and rivers, and small, temporary rain pools. Many species prefer habitats with vegetation. Others prefer habitats with none. Some breed in open, sun-lit pools, while others are found only in shaded breeding sites in forests. A few species breed in tree holes or the leaf axils of some plants.

=== Pupae ===

The pupa (also known as a tumbler) is comma-shaped when viewed from the side. The head and thorax are merged into a cephalothorax, with the abdomen curving around underneath it. As with the larvae, the pupa must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which it does through a pair of respiratory trumpets on its cephalothorax. After a few days as a pupa, the dorsal surface of the cephalothorax splits and the adult mosquito emerges.

=== Adults ===

Like all mosquitoes, adult &quot;Anopheles&quot; species have slender bodies with three sections: head, thorax and abdomen. The head is specialized for acquiring sensory information and for feeding. It contains the eyes and a pair of long, many-segmented antennae. The antennae are important for detecting host odours, as well as of breeding sites where females lay eggs. Female mosquitoes carrying &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites, the causative agents of malaria, are significantly more attracted to human breath and odours than uninfected mosquitoes.
The head has an elongated, forward-projecting proboscis used for feeding, and two maxillary palps. These palps carry the receptors for carbon dioxide, a major attractant that enables the mosquito to locate its host. The thorax is specialized for locomotion. Three pairs of legs and a pair of wings are attached to the thorax. The abdomen is specialized for food digestion and egg development. This segmented body part expands considerably when a female takes a blood meal. The blood is digested over time, serving as a source of protein for the production of eggs, which gradually fill the abdomen.

&quot;Anopheles&quot; can be distinguished from other mosquitoes by the palps, which are as long as the proboscis, and by the presence of discrete blocks of black and white scales on the wings. Adults can further be identified by their typical resting position: both sexes rest with their abdomens pointing up, unlike culicine mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large swarms, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate. The duration from egg to adult varies considerably among species, and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as little as five days, but it can take 10–14 days in tropical conditions.

Males live for about a week, feeding on nectar and other sources of sugar. Males cannot feed on blood, as it appears to produce toxic effects and kills them within a few days, around the same lifespan as a water-only diet. Females feed on sugar sources for energy, but usually require a blood meal for the development of eggs. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female rests for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes 2–3 days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking. The cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses.

== Ecology ==

=== Distribution ===

&quot;Anopheles&quot; species live both in tropical areas known for malaria such as sub-Saharan Africa, and in colder latitudes. Malaria outbreaks have in the past occurred in colder climates, for example during the construction of the Rideau Canal in Canada during the 1820s. &quot;Anopheles&quot; species that can transmit malaria are not limited to malaria-endemic areas, so areas where they have been eliminated are constantly at risk of reintroduction of the disease.

=== Habitat ===

&quot;Anopheles&quot; require bodies of water, possibly small and seasonal, for their aquatic larvae and pupae. Suitable habitats range from ponds to water tanks, swamps, ditches and puddles. The adults can however live in dry regions such as Africa&#x27;s savanna and Sahel. They can travel far from water, and are sometimes blown hundreds of kilometres by suitable winds. Adults can aestivate for months at a time, becoming dormant in hot dry weather, allowing them to persist through the African dry season. Further, &quot;Anopheles&quot; have been documented travelling in baggage, such as on aircraft.

=== Parasites ===

Parasites of &quot;Anopheles&quot; include Microsporidia of the genera &quot;Amblyospora&quot;, &quot;Crepidulospora&quot;, &quot;Senoma&quot; and &quot;Parathelohania&quot;. Two distinct life cycles are found in the Microsporidia. In the first type, the parasite is transmitted by the oral route and is relatively species nonspecific. In the second, while again the oral route is the usual route of infection, the parasite is ingested within an already infected intermediate host. Infection of the insect larval form is frequently tissue-specific, and commonly involves the fat body. Vertical (transovarial) transmission also occurs.

The parasitic &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria have been studied for use as control agents.

=== Predators ===

The jumping spider &quot;Evarcha culicivora&quot; indirectly feeds on vertebrate blood by preying on female &quot;Anopheles&quot;. Juvenile spiders choose the &quot;Anopheles&quot; over all other prey regardless of whether it actually is carrying blood. Juvenile spiders have adopted an &quot;Anopheles&quot;-specific prey-capture behavior, using the posture of &quot;Anopheles&quot; as a primary cue to identify them. &quot;Anopheles&quot; has a distinctive resting posture with its abdomen angled up. In this case, the spider approaches from behind the mosquito and under its abdomen, and then attacks from below.

== Malaria vectors ==

=== Preferred sources for blood meals ===

Since the genus &quot;Anopheles&quot; is the sole vector for malaria, it has been studied intensively in the search for effective control methods. One important behavioral factor is the degree to which an &quot;Anopheles&quot; species prefers to feed on humans (anthropophily) or animals such as cattle or birds (zoophily). Anthropophilic &quot;Anopheles&quot; are more likely to transmit the malaria parasites from one person to another. Most &quot;Anopheles&quot; are not exclusively anthropophilic or zoophilic, including the primary malaria vector in the western United States, &quot;A. freeborni&quot;. However, the primary malaria vectors in Africa, &quot;A. gambiae&quot; and &quot;A. funestus&quot;, are strongly anthropophilic and are consequently major vectors of human malaria.

=== Probability of transmitting malaria ===

Once ingested by a mosquito, malaria parasites must undergo development within the mosquito before they are infectious to humans. The time required for the parasite to develop in the mosquito (the extrinsic incubation period) ranges from 10 to 21 days, depending on the parasite species and the temperature. If a mosquito does not survive long enough for the parasite to develop, then she transmits no parasites.

It is not possible to measure directly the lifespans of mosquitoes in nature, but indirect estimates of daily survivorship have been made for several &quot;Anopheles&quot; species. Estimates of daily survivorship in Tanzania of &quot;A. gambiae&quot;, the vector of the dangerous &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; parasite, ranged from 0.77 to 0.84, meaning that after one day, between 77% and 84% have survived. Assuming this survivorship is constant through the adult life of a mosquito, less than 10% of female &quot;A. gambiae&quot; would survive longer than a 14-day extrinsic incubation period. If daily survivorship increased to 0.9, over 20% of mosquitoes would survive longer than the same period. Control measures that rely on insecticides (e.g. indoor residual spraying) may actually impact malaria transmission more through their effect on adult longevity than through their effect on the population of adult mosquitoes.

=== Patterns of feeding and resting ===

Most &quot;Anopheles&quot; are crepuscular (active at dusk or dawn) or nocturnal (active at night). Some feed indoors (endophagic), while others feed outdoors (exophagic). After feeding, some blood mosquitoes prefer to rest indoors (endophilic), while others prefer to rest outdoors (exophilic). Biting by nocturnal, endophagic &quot;Anopheles&quot; can be markedly reduced through the use of insecticide-treated bed nets or through improved housing construction to prevent mosquito entry (e.g. window screens). Endophilic mosquitoes are readily controlled by indoor spraying of residual insecticides. In contrast, exophagic/exophilic vectors are best controlled by destroying breeding sites, such as by filling in ponds.

=== Gut flora ===

Because transmission of disease by the mosquito requires ingestion of blood, the gut flora may have a bearing on the success of infection of the mosquito host. The larval and pupal gut is largely colonized by photosynthetic cyanobacteria, while in the adult, gram-negative bacteria in the Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota phyla predominate. Blood meals drastically reduce the diversity of microorganisms in the gut, favouring bacteria.

== Control ==
=== Insecticide control and resistance ===

Insecticides have offered a first line of approach to ridding areas of malarial mosquitoes. However, mosquitoes, with a short generation time, may rapidly evolve resistance, as experienced during the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign of the 1950s. The use of insecticides in agriculture has resulted in resistance in mosquito populations, implying that an effective control program must monitor for resistance and switch to other means if resistance is detected.

=== Eradication ===

In 2016, a CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive system was proposed to eradicate &quot;Anopheles gambiae&quot;, by deleting the &quot;dsx&quot; gene, causing female sterility. Such a gene drive system has been shown to suppress an entire caged &quot;A. gambiae&quot; population within 7–11 generations, typically less than a year. This has raised concerns with both the efficiency of a gene drive system as well as the ethical and ecological impact of such an eradication program. Therefore, there have been efforts to use the gene drive system to more efficiently introduce genes of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; resistance into the species, such as targeting and knocking out the &quot;FREP1&quot; gene in &quot;Anopheles gambiae.&quot; Researchers in Burkina Faso have created a strain of the fungus &quot;Metarhizium pinghaense&quot; that is genetically engineered to produce the venom of an Australian funnel-web spider; exposure to the fungus caused populations of &quot;Anopheles&quot; to crash by 99% in a controlled trial.

<text>The Ratak Chain ( , ) is a chain of islands and atolls within the island nation of the Marshall Islands. Ratak means &quot;sunrise&quot;. It lies to the east of the country&#x27;s other island chain, the Ralik Chain. In 1999, the total population of the Ratak islands was 30,925.

The atolls and isolated islands in the chain are:

* Ailuk Atoll
* Arno Atoll
* Aur Atoll
* Bikar Atoll
* Bokak Atoll
* Erikub Atoll
* Jemo Island
* Knox Atoll
* Likiep Atoll
* Majuro Atoll
* Maloelap Atoll
* Mejit Island
* Mili Atoll
* Taka Atoll
* Utirik Atoll
* Wotje Atoll

The Ratak Chain forms a continuous chain of seamounts with the Gilbert Islands to the south, which are part of Kiribati.

==Language==

The Ratak Chain is home to the Ratak dialect (or eastern dialect) of the Marshallese language. It is mutually intelligible with the Rālik dialect (or western dialect) located on the Rālik Chain. The two dialects differ mainly in lexicon and in certain regular phonological reflexes.

<text>Simon Leendert De Jong (April 29, 1942 – August 18, 2011) was an Indonesian-born Canadian parliamentarian. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1979 federal election as a New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of Parliament (MP) from Saskatchewan. He would spend five terms and 18 years in the House of Commons.

==Early life==
Simon De Jong was born in Sidoarjo, Indonesia, spending the first three years of his life, with his mother Dirkje and older brother Hielke in a concentration camp. Of 3,000 women and children who were incarcerated by the Japanese during the occupation of Java, only a third survived. Simon&#x27;s father, a Dutch mariner, was also a prisoner-of-war. The family were reunited after the war and returned to the Netherlands. They came to Canada in 1951, and Simon spent his formative years in Regina. Despite being an immigrant and non-English speaker and having a stutter, De Jong trained himself in public speaking, at which he became a provincial champion. In 1964, he became head of the student union at the University of Regina, where he wrote a constitution that empowered students and sparked campus unrest.

==Community activism==
After graduating, De Jong turned to painting, receiving international notice as a visual artist. However, through a series of sessions with LSD researcher, Dr. Duncan Blewett, De Jong became fascinated with the possibilities for societal change represented by the burgeoning youth counter-culture of the late 1960s. In 1969 he left Regina for Vancouver, where he went to work for The Greater Vancouver Youth Communications Center Society, better known as Cool Aid. At Cool Aid, De Jong, Ray Chouinard and other street workers organized alternative health, work, housing and cultural programs that influenced the future of the city. One of De Jong&#x27;s colleagues in those days was Mike Harcourt, who would later become the Premier of the Province of British Columbia.

==Career in politics==
De Jong returned to Regina in 1975. He ran as the NDP candidate for a Regina-area riding in 1979. His victory surprised everyone including De Jong himself. He would go on to serve five terms, retiring undefeated in 1997. As a parliamentarian, he exposed the spraying of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange by the U.S. military in the Canadian Province of New Brunswick. He was the first Member of Parliament to raise concerns about global warming. He spoke for disarmament at the United Nations; and he introduced a motion to send condolences to Yoko Ono when John Lennon was killed, which the artist gratefully acknowledged when De Jong died in 2011.

In 1989, De Jong was a dark-horse candidate to succeed Ed Broadbent as the leader of the NDP. He finished a respectable fourth in the leadership convention. However, a controversy overshadowed his candidacy. De Jong had agreed to be suited with a microphone in order to assist with a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) documentary on the convention, but forgot he was wearing it and inadvertently allowed back-room negotiations with fellow candidate Dave Barrett to be recorded. The CBC documentary used the tape as the dramatic centre-point of its convention coverage, giving it a sinister spin, as a &quot;secret deal&quot; cut amid &quot;shady&quot; back-room politics. De Jong always denied the CBC&#x27;s interpretation, insisting no deal was reached. Barrett remained silent about it. The documentarians re-enforced their characterization by mistranslating a second conversation thus gathered, a discussion in Dutch between De Jong and his mother, one of his advisors. The surrounding controversy hurt De Jong but was short-lived. However the scandal had lasting repercussions for De Jong within the party and contributed to his decision to retire some years later.

De Jong remained an MP until 1997 when he decided not to run for re-election in that year&#x27;s federal election, stepping aside in favour of Lorne Nystrom, who had been unseated four years earlier. After retiring from parliament, De Jong spent time in the United States, Asia and Brazil, where he became involved with the Daime church and its powerful psychedelic sacrament, ayahuasca. De Jong became increasingly philosophical, joining the mystical insights of the Daime religion to concerns about climate change and the necessity for humankind to raise its consciousness. &quot;The more aware we become, the better we become,&quot; he said.

De Jong once said of his colleague and friend Duncan Blewett, &quot;He saw light and love and hope where others would see only darkness.&quot; This characterized De Jong himself. When he died of leukemia on August 18, 2011, he was mourned by people of all political stripes and beliefs, including former BC Premier Harcourt and Bob Rae, leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.

<doc id="542082" wikidata="Q11787820" url="?curid=542082" title="I'm Alan Partridge">
<text>I&#x27;m Alan Partridge is a British sitcom created by Steve Coogan, Peter Baynham and Armando Iannucci. Coogan stars as Alan Partridge, a tactless and inept broadcaster. The first series, broadcast in 1997, has Partridge living in a roadside hotel after having been left by his wife and dropped by the BBC. The second, broadcast in 2002, sees Partridge living in a static caravan after recovering from a mental breakdown. Iannucci said the writers used the sitcom as &quot;a kind of social X-ray of male middle-aged Middle England&quot;.

The supporting cast includes Felicity Montagu as his faithful but timid personal assistant, Lynn Benfield; Simon Greenall as Geordie handyman Michael; and Phil Cornwell as Partridge&#x27;s rival DJ Dave Clifton. Series 2 also featured Amelia Bullmore as Partridge&#x27;s Ukrainian girlfriend Sonja. The show received critical acclaim and was a success amongst audiences, being nominated for three BAFTAs (winning two), two British Comedy Awards (winning both), and a Royal Television Society award. In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; was named the 38th-best British television series of all time.

==Premise==
Alan Partridge was created by Steve Coogan and the producer Armando Iannucci for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy programme &quot;On the Hour&quot;, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show&#x27;s sports presenter. In 1992, Partridge hosted a spin-off Radio 4 spoof chat show, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;. &quot;On the Hour&quot; transferred to television as &quot;The Day Today&quot; in 1994, followed by &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; later that year. The series ends with Partridge accidentally shooting a guest.

&quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; follows Partridge after he has been left by his wife and dropped from the BBC. In the first series, he lives in a roadside hotel, presents a graveyard slot on local Norwich radio, and desperately pitches ideas for new television shows. In the second series (2002), Partridge lives in a static caravan with his new Ukrainian girlfriend (Amelia Bullmore) after recovering from a mental breakdown. By then he has moved to the late night &quot;Norfolk Nights&quot; slot and also hosts &quot;Skirmish&quot;, a military-based general knowledge quiz show on digital cable channel UK Conquest, which Partridge says has &quot;the largest audience share for a digital channel at that time of day in the Norfolk area&quot;. The writers found the second series difficult to make, feeling it had been too long since the first and that expectations for sitcoms had changed. Iannucci said the writers used &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; as &quot;a kind of social X-ray of male middle-aged Middle England&quot;.

==Episodes==
===Series 1 (1997)===
===Series 2 (2002)===
== Reception ==
&quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; won the 1998 BAFTA awards for Comedy Performance and Comedy Programme or Series. Digital Spy wrote: &quot;the character of Partridge hit his comic peak&quot; in &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the show as &quot;bleakly hilarious&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; named &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; as one of the 10 best TV sitcoms of all time. In a poll of British comedians conducted by the TV channel Gold, it was named as the second-best British sitcom of all time. In a 2017 poll of over 100 comedians, a scene from &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; in which Partridge goes to the home of an obsessive fan was voted best comedy scene.

<doc id="542083" wikidata="Q5395595" url="?curid=542083" title="Vocal range">
<text>Vocal range is the range of pitches that a human voice can phonate. A common application is within the context of singing, where it is used as a defining characteristic for classifying singing voices into voice types. It is also a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech-language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders, although it has little practical application in terms of speech.

==Singing and the definition of vocal range==
While the broadest definition of &quot;vocal range&quot; is simply the span from the lowest to the highest note a particular voice can produce, this broad definition is often not what is meant when &quot;vocal range&quot; is discussed in the context of singing. Vocal pedagogists tend to define the vocal range as the total span of &quot;musically useful&quot; pitches that a singer can produce. This is because some of the notes a voice can produce may not be considered usable by the singer within performance for various reasons. For example, within opera all singers must project over an orchestra without the aid of a microphone. An opera singer would therefore only be able to include the notes that they are able to adequately project over an orchestra within their vocal range. In contrast, a pop artist could include notes that could be heard with the aid of a microphone.

Another factor to consider is the use of different forms of vocal production. The human voice is capable of producing sounds using different physiological processes within the larynx. These different forms of voice production are known as vocal registers. While the exact number and definition of vocal registers is a controversial topic within the field of singing, the sciences identify only four registers: the whistle register, the falsetto register, the modal register, and the vocal fry register. Typically only the usable pitches within the modal register—the register used in normal speech and most singing—are included when determining singers&#x27; vocal ranges. There are exceptions, as in opera, where countertenors employ falsetto and coloratura sopranos use the whistle register; notes from these registers would therefore be included in the vocal ranges of these voices.

== Evolution of sexual dimorphism in human voice pitch ==
The upper pitch range of the human voice is, on average, about half as high in males as in females. Even after controlling for body height and volume, the male voice remains lower. Charles Darwin suggested that the human voice evolved through intersexual sexual selection, via female mate choices. Puts (2005) showed that preference for male voice pitch changed according to the stage of the menstrual cycle while Puts (2006) found women preferred lower male voices mainly for short-term, sexual relationships. Intrasexual selection, via male competition, also causes a selection in voice pitch. Pitch is related to interpersonal power and males tend to adjust their pitch according to their perceived dominance when speaking to a competitor.

==Vocal range and voice classification==
Vocal range plays such an important role in classifying singing voices into voice types that sometimes the two terms are confused with one another. A voice type is a particular kind of human singing voice perceived as having certain identifying qualities or characteristics; vocal range being only one of those characteristics. Other factors are vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, vocal transition points, physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. All of these factors combined are used to categorize a singer&#x27;s voice into a particular kind of singing use or voice type.

The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are several systems in use including the German Fach system, the Italian opera tradition, and French opera tradition. There are other systems of classification as well, most commonly the choral music system.

No system is universally applied or accepted. Most of the voice types identified by such systems, however, are sub-types that fall under seven different major voice categories that are for the most part acknowledged across all of the major voice classification systems. Women are typically divided into three main groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four main groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. When considering the pre-pubescent voices of children an eighth term, treble, can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.

Vocal range itself does not determine a singer&#x27;s voice type. While each voice type does have a general vocal range associated with it, human singing voices may possess vocal ranges that encompass more than one voice type or are in between the typical ranges of two voice types. Therefore, voice teachers use vocal range as only one factor among many in classifying a singer&#x27;s voice. More important than range in voice classification is tessitura, or where the voice is most comfortable singing, and vocal timbre, or the characteristic sound of the singing voice. For example, a female singer may have a vocal range that encompasses the low notes of a mezzo-soprano and the high notes of a soprano. A voice teacher would therefore look to see whether the singer was more comfortable singing higher, or lower. If she were more comfortable singing higher, then the teacher would probably classify her as a soprano. If the singer were more comfortable singing in the mid to lower part of their voice the teacher would probably classify her as a mezzo-soprano. The teacher would also consider the sound of the voice; sopranos tend to have a lighter and less rich vocal sound than a mezzo-soprano. A voice teacher, however, would never classify a singer in more than one voice type, regardless of the size of the vocal range of the singer.

=== Operatic six basic voice types ===
Within the operatic systems of classification, there are six basic voice types. The ranges given below are approximations and are not meant to be too rigidly applied.

* Soprano: the highest female voice typically between C and C
* Mezzo-soprano: the middle female voice typically between A and A
* Contralto: the lowest female voice typically between F and F
* Tenor: the highest male voice typically between C and C
* Baritone: the middle male voice typically between A and A
* Bass: the lowest male voice typically between E and E

Some men, in falsetto voice or as a result of certain rare physiological conditions, can sing in the same range as women. These do not fall into the female categories, instead called &quot;countertenors&quot; within classical music. Within contemporary music, however, the use of the term &quot;tenor&quot; for these male voices would be more appropriate.

Within choral music there are only four categories for adult singers: soprano and alto for women, tenor and bass for men.

In the UK, the term &quot;male alto&quot; refers to a man who uses falsetto vocal production to sing in the alto section of a chorus. This practice is much less common outside the UK where the term countertenor is more often applied. Countertenors are also widely employed within opera as solo vocalists, though the term &quot;male alto&quot; is never used to refer to a solo vocalist.

Children&#x27;s voices, both male and female, are described as &quot;trebles&quot;, although boy soprano is widely used as well.

<doc id="542092" wikidata="Q6415727" url="?curid=542092" title="Kirkland College">
<text>Kirkland College was a small, private liberal arts women&#x27;s college located in Clinton, New York, from 1965 to 1978. It was a female counterpart to Hamilton College, at that time all male, and its campus was adjacent to Hamilton&#x27;s. It was named for Samuel Kirkland, who founded the Hamilton-Oneida Academy, origin of Hamilton College (and for whom, some felt, Hamilton should have been named). It was not successful financially, so Hamilton absorbed Kirkland on June 30, 1978, has maintained its archives and financial endowment, and supports its alumnae community.

==History==

Planning for Kirkland began during the 1962-1963 academic year through the influence of then-Hamilton College president Robert W. McEwen. It was named for Samuel Kirkland, the founder of Hamilton. Hamilton was a men&#x27;s college. Kirkland College, a college for women, was envisioned as the first of several institutions which would form a cluster similar to the Claremont Colleges. Though the &quot;cluster&quot; vision was never achieved, two factors led to a more innovative and experimental nature at Kirkland: first, the introduction of progressive views of undergraduate education on the part of Millicent Carey McIntosh, former President of Barnard College, who came on as a member of the first Board of Trustees, and second, the mandate to &quot;make a fresh attack on introducing major fields of learning&quot; without being constrained by the more traditional patterns at Hamilton – a mandate embraced by Kirkland&#x27;s first and only president, Samuel F. Babbitt. The untimely passing of Hamilton President McEwen, also a member of the first Kirkland Board, deprived Kirkland of its chief champion at Hamilton.

Kirkland was charted by the University of the State of New York in 1965 and opened in 1968 on its own campus, adjacent to Hamilton College. The Kirkland faculty and students operated in a more diverse and transparent community than had been the norm at Hamilton. Students received evaluations rather than grades in their courses. There were no academic departments. Students did not have set &quot;majors&quot;; rather, each student worked out a program of study. In contrast with Hamilton, most Kirkland professors taught their classes in a highly interactive mode, engaging students in a dialogue, without lectures. A key tenet of the college was that students would be actively engaged in running the institution: at Kirkland, the students participated equally in governing the college. Moreover, at Kirkland, a number of professors lived on campus and participated actively in the lives of students. Kirkland was innovative, experimenting with an approach to undergraduate education that was in distinct contrast to that of Hamilton.

Kirkland was defined by its innovative spirit; Hamilton by its fidelity to tradition. Although the new college got off to an exciting start, the many differences in educational and community functioning inevitably led to small and large conflicts between the two institutions. Although President Babbitt and others at Kirkland vigorously disputed this, there was a perception among some at Hamilton that Kirkland was a second-class or less rigorous school. For example, while Hamilton students could register for any Kirkland class, Kirkland students, at first, could not take Hamilton classes without permission from the Hamilton professor teaching the class in question, who would review the student&#x27;s record. &quot;Many administrators, faculty, and students at Hamilton believed that theirs was the superior institution and dealt with their counterparts at Kirkland as if they were subordinates.&quot; Kirkland was perceived by some as favoring &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; subjects such as performing arts and social sciences, The SAT scores of Kirkland students were lower than those of Hamilton students, although Kirkland students did as well if not better than Hamilton men in the Hamilton courses they took.

Meantime, the economic climate, which had been very positive during the planning stages for Kirkland, began to deteriorate. As a result, the debt service accruing to build Kirkland&#x27;s entirely new campus exerted a tremendous burden on its finances. Construction costs in one year increased by 10%. Planning a large endowment fundraising effort (&quot;The Campaign for the Second Decade&quot;) Kirkland turned to Hamilton for an operating funds guarantee. In 1977, finding that Kirkland was unlikely to become economically self-sufficient, Hamilton refused such assistance, and the two colleges were merged over much student protest into a single, coeducational Hamilton in 1978. The process has been described as a &quot;hostile takeover&quot;; at the end the relationship between the two colleges was &quot;adversarial&quot;, the mood on the two campuses at times &quot;near riot&quot;. &quot;To say there was anger around campus at that time is to considerably understate the depth of feelings at play.&quot;

A study and consideration in the form of an &#x27;intimate history&#x27; by Samuel Fisher Babbitt, Kirkland&#x27;s only president – &quot;Limited Engagement: Kirkland College 1965-1978, An Intimate History of the Rise and Fall of a Coordinate College for Women&quot; – provides an in-depth, first-person account of Kirkland&#x27;s brief existence. In addition to personal records and recollection, Babbitt was able to employ archival materials housed in the Hamilton College and Columbia University libraries. He described the merger of Kirkland and Hamilton as &quot;messy.&quot;

Despite its dissolution, Kirkland College, through faculty who remained to teach at Hamilton, and through the active influence of its graduates and former trustees, has had a profound influence on Hamilton, which became coeducational, and broadened its offerings, with far less opposition than it would have before Kirkland. 

==Legacy at Hamilton College==
When Kirkland was officially incorporated into and absorbed by Hamilton College in 1978, Hamilton became coed. All Kirkland students were able to continue at the new Hamilton, and most did, but not so faculty. While all Kirkland faculty were offered short-term appointments at Hamilton, Kirkland tenure was not transferred; tenured Kirkland faculty had to pass a tenure review to transfer to Hamilton. Most did, but discontent with the way the merger was executed festered long after 1978, coloring alumnae relations, inter-faculty relations and, to some degree, campus social dynamics. Despite such friction, many of the educational principles of Kirkland (such as student-designed majors and independent study) found their way into the Hamilton curriculum. Efforts on the part of both Kirkland and Hamilton alumni to acknowledge common interests have begun to mend these breaches by responding to the curiosity and interests of current Hamilton students regarding Kirkland and its influence on their college.

The college&#x27;s art and music departments are located on the Kirkland side of the campus, which has more modern architecture than the original Hamilton.

===Endowment===
Upon the dissolution of Kirkland, its endowment was transferred to the Hamilton endowment, with existing restrictions intact, with the understanding that all funds were to be applied &quot;to support women and their needs and interests at Hamilton.&quot; One on-going Hamilton program that received early support from the Kirkland Endowment is HAVOC (Hamilton Association for Volunteering, Outreach and Charity).)

===Memorabilia and traditions===
The Kirkland Archives, including the papers of President Babbitt, are housed in the Burke Library at Hamilton College. In 2007 a display case, containing a rotating exhibit of items from the Archives, was installed in the lobby of McEwen Hall, near an iconic sculpture, the &quot;rock swing&quot; that dates from Kirkland&#x27;s early years.

The central motif of the Kirkland College seal was an apple tree, and green apples remain a symbol of Kirkland among its alumnae and supporters to this day. During commencement exercises at Hamilton many students and faculty choose to wear a green apple pin on their academic robes to honor Kirkland&#x27;s legacy. Many graduating seniors also place green apples on the podium prior to receiving their diplomas.

The Hamilton College Bookstore sells various Kirkland merchandise, typically available on campus during June reunions.

===The Kirkland Project===
In the mid-1990s, a group of Hamilton faculty initiated a project with the intention of working &quot;toward establishing a research center like the Bunting Institute at Harvard and the Pembroke Center at Brown.&quot;

The Kirkland Project is named in honor of Kirkland College, building on Kirkland&#x27;s twin legacies of women&#x27;s education and innovative pedagogy, expanding on them to meet the global challenges that face contemporary male and female students, faculty and staff.

<doc id="542094" wikidata="Q1024838" url="?curid=542094" title="Cabin Fever (2002 film)">
<text>Cabin Fever is a 2002 American comedy horror film co-written and directed by Eli Roth (in his directorial debut) and the first installment in the &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; franchise. The film stars Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, James DeBello, Cerina Vincent, Joey Kern, and Giuseppe Andrews. Inspired by a real-life experience where Roth developed a skin infection during a trip to Iceland, the story follows a group of college students who rent a cabin in the woods and fall victim to an unknown flesh-eating disease.

==Plot==
Henry, a hermit walking in the woods, encounters his dog, dead from a blood infection, and becomes infected himself from contact with his dog&#x27;s blood.

College students Jeff, Marcy, Paul, Karen, and Bert take a vacation to a remote cabin to celebrate October break. Bert leaves to hunt squirrels but accidentally shoots the now disfigured and bloody Henry. Despite Henry&#x27;s pleas for aid, Bert flees and remains silent about the incident.

As the students gather around a campfire that night, they are joined by a friendly drifter named Grimm and his pet dog, Dr. Mambo. When it rains, Grimm leaves with his dog. While the friends wait for Grimm, Henry stumbles into their camp begging for help. When Bert shuts the door on the sick hermit, he tries to steal the group&#x27;s car while vomiting blood. When Henry approaches Marcy and Karen, Paul accidentally sets him on fire.

Next day, while seeking help fixing their truck, Jeff and Bert encounter a butcher but leave after learning that she is Henry&#x27;s cousin. Paul calls police Deputy Winston, who promises to send up a tow truck. Paul tries comforting Karen, who is upset over Henry&#x27;s death. After calming her down, Paul attempts to have sex with her, only to discover a bloody, infected wound on her thigh. The group isolates her in a shed.

After fixing the truck, Bert coughs up blood but hides it from the others, and drives off after Paul and Jeff find out. Jeff takes the remaining beer and leaves, terrified of becoming infected. Bert seeks help at a convenience store but angers the owner after his disturbed son, Dennis, bites him. Bert flees, chased by Dennis&#x27;s father and two friends. At the cabin, Marcy worries that they will all contract the disease. Paul comforts her, and they impulsively have sex. Soon after, he leaves the cabin to find Jeff, while Marcy takes a bath, crying. As she shaves her legs, the flesh begins to peel off and she runs outside in a panic, where she is mauled and eaten alive by Dr. Mambo.

Paul discovers Henry&#x27;s body floating in the reservoir, and realizes that the infection is spreading through the water supply. Returning to the cabin, Paul finds Marcy&#x27;s bloody remains and sees Dr. Mambo feeding on a weakened Karen. After killing the dog with Bert&#x27;s gun, Paul mercy-kills Karen with a shovel.

A dying Bert returns to the cabin pursued by Dennis&#x27;s father and his two companions. The posse kills Bert, and Paul kills all three of them. Paul looks for Jeff and instead finds Grimm&#x27;s corpse in a cave. Paul takes the convenience store&#x27;s truck, and, while driving, discovers that he is infected before hitting a deer. He reunites with Deputy Winston, who is partying with underage drinkers. Paul requests a ride to the hospital, but before the group departs, Winston is ordered to kill on sight several infected people on a killing spree.

Paul attacks but does not kill Winston. As he attempts to hitch a ride, he falls unconscious and gets picked up by a passing vehicle, whose occupants drops him off at a hospital. The doctors request Deputy Winston to transfer Paul another medical facility.

The next day, Jeff, who has been hiding out and drinking in the woods, returns to the cabin. Initially crying after seeing the remains of his friends, he becomes ecstatic upon realizing that he survives. As he raises his arms in victory, he is killed by local police, and his body burned with the remains of Bert and Karen. The sheriff asks Winston if he took care of Paul.

Two kids get water from the lake for their lemonade stand, not realizing that a barely alive Paul is in the lake and contaminating the water. The sheriff and his deputies stop by the convenience store, owned by the children&#x27;s grandfather, where they buy glasses of lemonade.

==Production==
===Writing===
Eli Roth co-wrote &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; with friend and former NYU roommate Randy Pearlstein in 1995 while Roth was working as a production assistant for Howard Stern&#x27;s &quot;Private Parts&quot;. Roth was inspired to write the script after getting an intense skin infection after working on a farm in Iceland. Early attempts to sell the script were unsuccessful because studios felt that the horror genre had become unprofitable. In 1996, the film &quot;Scream&quot; was released to great success, leading studios to once again become interested in horror properties. Roth still could not sell his script, as studios told him that it should be more like &quot;Scream&quot;. Many potential financiers also found the film&#x27;s content to be unsettling, including not only the gore but also the use of the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot; early in the film.

Various elements of the script were inspired by Roth&#x27;s favorite horror films, including &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981). David Lynch, whom Roth had worked under during the early stages of his career, had signed on to executive produce the film. However, Lynch is not credited in the final product.

===Casting===

The auditions for the character of Marcy had been scheduled to take place on September 11, 2001. The scene the producers had chosen for the auditioning actresses was the build-up to Marcy&#x27;s sex scene with Paul. In the scene, Marcy is convinced that all the students are doomed and despite Paul&#x27;s reassurances, she describes their situation as &quot;like being on a plane, when you know it&#x27;s gonna crash. Everybody around you is screaming &#x27;We&#x27;re Going Down! We&#x27;re Going Down!&#x27; and all you want to do is grab the person next to you and fuck them, because you know you&#x27;re going to be dead soon, anyway.&quot; Eli Roth and the producers tried to cancel the Marcy auditions, but the general chaos caused by the attacks made it impossible for them to reach many of the actresses who were scheduled to try out for the role. In October 2001, Jordan Ladd and James DeBello entered negotiations to join the film. Michael Rosenbaum was set to star in the film, but would later vacate the project.

===Filming===
Filming on &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; began in late 2001 and lasted 24 days, on location in North Carolina. Production was stalled after one day of filming due to an anthrax scare. According to Roth, filming was shut down a second time due to a union dispute. Cabin scenes were filmed at Catawba cabin, an isolated spot at Raven Knob Scout Reservation, near Mt. Airy, NC. Roth originally wanted Cerina Vincent to show her naked buttocks during her sex scene with Rider Strong. Vincent, who had previously played a nude foreign exchange student in &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; (2001), was afraid that exposing too much of herself would lead to being typecast as a nudity actress and vehemently refused to bare her buttocks. At the peak of this conflict between the two, Vincent told Roth that if he wanted the shot so badly, he would need to re-cast the role with another actress. But they managed to reach a compromise, in which Vincent showed one inch of her buttocks on camera before Roth measured it for it to be precise. Bedsheets were then taped to her backside at the designated level and the scene was filmed.

===Music===
Composer Angelo Badalamenti agreed to compose some musical themes for the film out of enthusiasm for the material. However, the bulk of the film&#x27;s score was composed by Nathan Barr. Some of the music selected for the film was deliberately chosen by Roth for their connection to other horror films; in the opening scene for example, while the main characters are driving to the cabin, &quot;The Road Leads to Nowhere&quot;, a song written and recorded for &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972), is playing on the radio.

==Release==

The film premiered at the Midnight Madness section of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 2002 and was the festival&#x27;s closing feature film. After a successful run at TIFF, the distribution rights to the film was sold to Lionsgate for $3.5 million. &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; was released in the United States on September 12, 2003; it landed at No. 3 during its opening weekend, grossing $8.3 million on 2,087 theaters (an average of $4,137 per screen). The film ended its theatrical run with a gross of $21.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and $30.6 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film released by Lionsgate of that year.

&quot;Cabin Fever&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in March 2004, which includes audio commentary tracks with director Eli Roth and the main cast as well as a featurette entitled &quot;Beneath the Skin&quot;, which provides a behind the scenes look on the film. The Blu-ray was released in February 2010, featuring Roth&#x27;s edited version of the film that was screened at TIFF. The Blu-ray was created from the film&#x27;s original camera negative overseen by Roth, and includes a brand-new audio commentary with Roth and the main cast as well as a gallery of rare behind the scenes photos.

==Critical reception==
Uproxx reported that &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; drew &quot;better-than-average&quot; reviews. Some critics complimented the performances from the leads as &quot;solid&quot; while others judged them merely &quot;adequate&quot;. Their characters, however, were met with negative reactions: IGN and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Manohla Dargis described them, respectively, as stereotypical and &quot;monumentally irritating&quot;. Furthermore, IGN and Dargis criticized the film&#x27;s lack of scares, delivering more jokes and gore. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; disagreed; Holden said &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; &quot;finds an unusually potent blend of dread, gore and gallows humor&quot;, and Travers called it &quot;a blast of good gory fun that just won&#x27;t quit&quot;. Kim Newman in &quot;Empire&quot; and Maitland McDonagh in &quot;TV Guide&quot; awarded &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; three stars out of five.

Reviewers observed the film&#x27;s homage to low-budget horror and thriller films, including &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;, &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; and its sequel &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. IGN said &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; &quot;struggles valiantly to be both a worthy addition and simultaneous homage to these genres ... becoming instead a passably enjoyable slab of schlock&quot;, criticizing its failure to reinvent the films that inspired Roth&#x27;s. Conversely, Newman said: &quot;There&#x27;s a fine line between homage and simply stealing, but writer-director Eli Roth mostly manages the former&quot;. Stephen Hunter in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; compared poorly to &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, describing it as &quot;a loud, derivative grade-Z horror film of no particular distinction&quot;. McDonagh said &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; was &quot;more &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; than &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;&quot;, citing its theme of &quot;degeneration of relationships under pressure&quot;.

Some critics said &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; suffered from genre and tone inconsistencies, with Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; comparing the flaw to &quot;kids on those arcade games where the target lights up and you have to stomp on it&quot;. Ebert was critical that the film alternates between horror and &quot;weird humor&quot;, getting nowhere; he said it &quot;could develop its plague story in a serious way, like a George Romero picture or &quot;28 Days Later&quot;&quot;. Owen Gleiberman in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Cabin Fever&quot; is what &quot;28 Days Later&quot; would have looked like had it been made without style, subtlety, grunge-of-night video photography, or fashionable apocalyptic pretensions.&quot; Ebert gave &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; one-and-a-half stars out of four, and Gleiberman said it was &quot;a big, dumb, crude, noisy, goose-the-audience bash and proud of it&quot;.

The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 62% based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;More gory than scary, &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; is satisfied with paying homage to genre conventions rather than reinventing them.&quot; On Metacritic, the film earned &quot;mixed or average reviews,&quot; with a weighted average of 56 out of 100 based on 31 reviews. Peter Jackson, the director of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, was a notable fan of &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;. Having seen the film from a print sent to him, Jackson suspended production on &quot;The Return of the King&quot; twice in his native New Zealand to have it screened to his cast and crew members. He complimented the film as &quot;unrelenting, gruesomely funny bloodbath&quot;. Quentin Tarantino also expressed his admiration for &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;, calling Roth &quot;the future of horror&quot;.

== Related works==
Roth revealed in a 2010 interview that he had written a treatment for the sequel to &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; as part of Lionsgate&#x27;s distribution deal, pitching it as &quot;a &quot;Song of the South&quot; horror movie filled with corpses and sex.&quot; Since Lionsgate was unwilling to produce his idea, Roth entrusted Ti West to direct the sequel entirely from West&#x27;s own version. &quot;Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever&quot; was released in 2009.

A prequel to the two previous films, &quot;Cabin Fever: Patient Zero&quot;, was directed by Kaare Andrews in 2016. A remake of the original, also titled &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;, was subsequently announced that same year, with Roth staying on as executive producer. Travis Zariwny directed the film using &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; original screenplay co-written by Roth. Despite being panned by critics upon its 2016 release, with critics calling it &quot;pointless&quot; and derivative, Roth said he was genuinely happy with the remake.

<text>Howard Douglas McCurdy (10 December 1932 – 20 February 2018) was a Canadian civil rights activist, politician and university professor. He grew up in Southwestern Ontario before moving to the Windsor, Ontario, area. He did his undergraduate work at what is now known as the University of Windsor and doctoral degree at Michigan State University. He became a tenured professor at the University of Windsor and eventually became a department head. In 1980, he entered politics when he was elected to the City of Windsor&#x27;s council. In 1984, McCurdy entered federal politics when he won a seat in the House of Commons. He was the second Black Canadian to serve in parliament and the first for the New Democratic Party of Canada. He lost his seat during a Liberal Party sweep of Ontario ridings in the 1993 federal election. In 2012 he earned several awards including the Order of Ontario and the Order of Canada. In later life he had many health issues and died in the Windsor-area in 2018.

== Early life==
Born in London, Ontario, McCurdy&#x27;s great-great grandfather Nasa McCurdy was an agent on the Underground Railroad by which African-American slaves escaped to Canada in the 19th century.

He moved to Amherstburg, Ontario, when he was 9 and encountered racism for the first time when he tried to join the Cub Scouts and was excluded, being told to form a Black-only troop. He later traced his activism back to his experiences with discrimination at this young age.

==Academic career==
McCurdy studied at the University of Western Ontario, where he received a Bachelor of Arts, and later at Assumption University, where he received a Bachelor of Science. He was awarded a Master of Science and a Ph.D. in microbiology and chemistry from Michigan State University.

While at Michigan State, McCurdy founded the university&#x27;s National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter and became its first president. In 1962 he founded the Guardian Club a civil rights organization to fight racial discrimination in Windsor. In 1969 he was the co-founder and the first President of the National Black Coalition of Canada.

In 1959, McCurdy joined the Biology Department at Assumption College, which became the University of Windsor (U. of W.) in 1963. After initially being hired as a lecturer, he eventually became the first Canadian-born person of African descent to hold a tenure-track position in a Canadian university. He was the head of the Biology Department from 1973 to 1979. Under his direction, the department grew to include over 1,400 students, 21 full-time faculty members and was the largest department at the university. He more than doubled the department&#x27;s research grants, and had the highest applied for and received percentage of any biology department in Ontario.

In 1976–80 he founded and was president of the Canadian College of Microbiologists. McCurdy authored more than 50 scientific papers and served on the editorial boards of &quot;Bacteriological Reviews&quot; and the &quot;Canadian Journal of Microbiology&quot;. In 1967–68 he was president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers.

==Political career==

===Windsor City Council===
After stepping down as the head of the University of Windsor&#x27;s Biology Department, he continued teaching there, but decided at the last minute to run for elected office, to build his credibility as a future candidate. On his first try, he was elected as an alderman to Windsor City Council on 10 November 1980. He defeated controversial Ward 3 incumbent alderman, Don Clarke. Clarke got into a physical altercation with another alderman in the council chamber as well as being noted for using foul language at meetings. By making an issue of Clarke&#x27;s lack of comportment at council meetings, McCurdy was able to defeat him, even though he did not live in Ward 3. McCurdy won re-election on 8 November 1982. McCurdy represented Ward 3 for two terms, the first term was for two years, and the second term was for three years, before going into federal politics. He resigned from City Council on 24 September 1984, with a little over a year left in his term. He only resigned after he was officially declared the winner of the recent federal election for the local electoral district by Elections Canada.

===Member of Parliament===
While still serving as an alderman, he became the New Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in the 1984 Canadian federal election for the riding of Windsor—Walkerville. Since 1935, the riding was a Liberal Party stronghold or safe seat. Not only did McCurdy win, but the Liberal candidate, Terry Patterson, came in third, behind the Progressive Conservative candidate Tom Porter. With his victory, he became Canada&#x27;s second Black Member of Parliament (MP) after Lincoln Alexander, and the first Black NDP MP. He ran for re-election in the redistributed riding of Windsor—St. Clair for the 1988 election. He defeated Liberal Party candidate Shaughnessy Cohen.

===1989 NDP leadership run===
When Ed Broadbent stepped down as the federal NDP leader, McCurdy decided to run. The delegated leadership convention was held in Winnipeg from 30 November to 3 December 1989. McCurdy finished fifth on the first ballot and decided drop-off the ballot for the second. He moved his delegates over to fellow Windsor MP, Stephen Langdon, and then decided to eventually endorse Audrey McLaughlin, who would go on to win. McLaughlin lead the NDP to their worst-ever defeat in the 1993 federal election. That weak NDP campaign hurt his re-election chances when he faced-off against Cohen again, and lost.

===Post-House of Commons Career===
A tribute celebration in McCurdy&#x27;s honour was given by the local NDP electoral district association on 5 March 1994.Ontario Premier Bob Rae and some members of his cabinet attended the event, fuelling speculation that McCurdy was going to get a prestigious Ontario appointment. Premier Rae denied such speculation when he talked to the press that evening and none materialized.

In April 1994, the federal NDP was in crisis mode as they were no longer an official party in the House of Commons. The nine-member House of Commons caucus threatened action if Audrey McLaughlin did not step down as the federal leader. McCurdy was a vice-president of the NDP and sat on the party&#x27;s federal council. McLaughlin agreed to step down as leader within two years and made that public on 19 April 1984. The council asked her to stay on as leader until a new one could be elected. McCurdy was more interested in seeing the party renew itself, than worry about a leadership convention, and supported the idea that she stay on until the renewal process was completed. That autumn, people were encouraging him to challenge for NDP leadership again, but he did not make another attempt.

===Political comeback attempt===
McCurdy did attempt to get back into elected politics but at the provincial level in 1995. At the time, the Ontario NDP was the provincial government. However, Premier Rae&#x27;s Social Contract wage restriction policy, enacted in 1993, was unpopular with labour unions across the province. It restricted wages of public workers and forced them to take unpaid days off known as &quot;Ray Days&quot;. This made him and the government targets of labour leaders such as CUPE Ontario&#x27;s Sid Ryan and the Canadian Auto Workers Union&#x27;s (CAW) Buzz Hargrove. In April, McCurdy was asked by local Windsor–Essex area labour leaders to denounce the Social Contract, which he refused in a letter he wrote to Windsor and District Labour Council president Gary Parent.

On 12 April 1995, McCurdy announced he would be running for the Ontario NDP nomination in the Windsor—Sandwich electoral district. It was thought he would be unopposed, and a nomination meeting would be held about two weeks later. McCurdy was backed by Premier Rae and the central party already published pamphlets with his name on them. 

But it was not going to be an uncontested race as NDP activist, and Social Contract opponent, Arlene Rousseau entered the race. The nomination was moved up from 18 May to 30 April, because the writ was dropped for the 1995 Ontario general election.

McCurdy&#x27;s nomination team thought he had 80 votes to Rousseau&#x27;s 58. But about 30 of his supporters stayed home, likely from pressure from the CAW telling members not to support a Rae-endorsed candidate. The unexpected happened, as McCurdy only received 53 votes and was defeated by Rousseau&#x27;s 58 votes. After publicly congratulating Rousseau, McCurdy met with reporters and said that labour was &quot;&quot;shooting itself in the foot&quot; in order to punish the Rae government for imposing the hated social contract.&quot; Prescient words as the Mike Harris-lead Progressive Conservatives won the election, and implemented &quot;The Common Sense Revolution&quot; program that hurt labour&#x27;s interests with Bill 138, and caused labour unrest with public sector unions.

In 2003, McCurdy supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign for NDP leader.

He served as the president of the Windsor Black Coalition from 2003–2005.

==Death==
In later life, McCurdy was dealing with health issues, including more than one form of cancer. He died on 20 February 2018, at the age of 85 and was survived by his wife Brenda, four children, and 10 grandchildren.

==Awards==
McCurdy has received many awards, including the Canadian Centennial Medal in 1967, the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, and in 2001 the J. S. Woodsworth Award for Human Rights.

In 2012, McCurdy was made a member of the Order of Ontario. Also in 2012, he received Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubliee Medal. On 19 November 2012, McCurdy was designated a Member of the Order of Canada with investiture into the order occurring on 3 May 2013.

<text>Jonathan Taylor Thomas (; born September 8, 1981) is an American actor and director. He is known for portraying Randy Taylor on &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and voicing young Simba in Disney&#x27;s 1994 animated feature film &quot;The Lion King&quot; and Pinocchio in New Line Cinema&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Thomas was born on September 8, 1981, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Sacramento, California, and then to Los Angeles. Thomas&#x27;s uncle was playwright and actor Jeff Weiss (1940–2022). Thomas has Pennsylvania Dutch and Portuguese ancestry.

In 2000, Thomas enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied philosophy and history and spent his third year abroad at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. In 2010, he graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies.

==Career==
===Television===
Thomas began his television career in 1990, playing the role of Kevin Brady, the son of Greg Brady, on &quot;The Bradys&quot;, a spin-off of the 1970s TV show &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. In 1991, Thomas appeared in three episodes of Fox&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot;. That same year, he was cast as middle son Randy Taylor on ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Despite looking much younger, in reality, Thomas was a month older than Zachery Ty Bryan who played his elder brother Brad. Thomas remained with &quot;Home Improvement&quot; well into his teenage years but left the show in 1998 to focus on academics, and was only involved in three episodes of the final season.

Since departing &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, Thomas has acted only occasionally. In early 2004, he had a small guest role on &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;, another ABC sitcom, and appeared in the WB&#x27;s &quot;Smallville&quot; in 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Thomas appeared in UPN&#x27;s high school detective drama &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and was also featured on &quot;The E! True Hollywood Story&quot;″s episode on &quot;Home Improvement&quot;.

On March 22, 2013, Thomas guest-starred on the second-season finale of his third ABC sitcom, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, and again in the fourth episode of the third season on October 11, 2013, reuniting with Tim Allen, his TV father from &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. On January 10, 2015, he had a small cameo on the twelfth episode of the fourth season of &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, reuniting with both of his TV parents from &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, Tim Allen and Patricia Richardson.

Thomas directed three episodes of &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; between 2013 and 2016.

Since 2017, Thomas has served as a national board member of the media labor union SAG-AFTRA.

===Film===
Thomas appeared in many films during and after his run on &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. He had a few roles as a voice actor in his child years, including Disney&#x27;s animated feature &quot;The Lion King&quot;, in which he voiced the protagonist Simba as a cub.

He also appeared in live-action films. Among the ones he starred in are those from Disney: &quot;Man of the House&quot;, &quot;Tom and Huck&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;. Other live-action films starring Thomas are an adaptation of &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (in which he played and voiced the titular character), &quot;Wild America&quot;, &quot;Speedway Junky&quot;, and &quot;Walking Across Egypt&quot;.

<text>Schizotypal personality disorder (StPD or SPD), also known as schizotypal disorder, is a cluster A personality disorder. The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) describes the disorder specifically as a personality disorder characterized by thought disorder, paranoia, a characteristic form of social anxiety, derealization, transient psychosis, and unconventional beliefs.

People with this disorder often feel pronounced discomfort in forming and maintaining social connections with other people, primarily due to the belief that other people harbor negative thoughts and views about them. Peculiar speech mannerisms and socially unexpected modes of dress are also characteristic. People with StPD may react oddly in conversations, not respond, or talk to themselves. They frequently interpret situations as being strange or having unusual meanings for them; paranormal and superstitious beliefs are common. People with StPD usually disagree with the suggestion that their thoughts and behaviors are a &#x27;disorder&#x27; and seek medical attention for depression or anxiety instead. Schizotypal personality disorder occurs in approximately 3% of the general population and is more commonly diagnosed in males.

== Signs and symptoms ==

=== Magical thinking ===
Odd and magical thinking is common among people with StPD. They are more likely to believe in supernatural phenomena and entities. It is common for people with StPD to experience severe social anxiety and have paranoid ideation. Ideas of reference are common in people with StPD. They can feel as if expressing themselves is dangerous. They may also feel that others are more competent, and have deeply entrenched and pervasive insecurities. Strange thinking patterns may be a defense mechanism against these feelings. People with StPD usually have limited levels of self-awareness. They may believe others think of them more negatively than they actually do.

=== Affect ===
Patients with StPD can have difficulties in recognizing their or others&#x27; emotions. This can extend to difficulties expressing emotion. They may have limited responses to others&#x27; emotions and can be ambivalent. It is common for people with StPD to derive limited joy from activities. People with StPD are typically more socially isolated and uninterested in social situations than most people, although they can be socially active on the internet. Depersonalization, derealization, boredom, and internal fantasies are common in patients with StPD. Abnormal facial expressions are also common in people with StPD, and they can have aberrant eye movements and difficulty responding to stimuli. They are more prone to substance abuse or suicidal ideation. Another epidemiological study on suicidal behavior in StPD found that, even when accounting for sociodemographic factors, people with StPD were 1.51 times more likely to attempt suicide.

=== Cognition ===
People with StPD tend to have cognitive impairments. They can have abnormal perceptional and sensory experiences such as illusions. For example, someone with StPD may perceive colors as lighter or darker than others perceive them. Facial perception may also be difficult for people with the disorder. They can see others as deformed, may misrecognize them, or can feel as if they are alien to them. People with StPD can have difficulty processing information such as speech or language. They are more likely to speak slowly, with less fluctuation in pitch, and long pauses between speech. Patients with StPD may have a lower odor detection threshold, and can have impaired auditory or olfactory processing. It is also common for people with StPD to struggle with context processing, which cause them to form loose connections between events. In addition, people with StPD can have decreased capacities for multisensory integration or contrast sensitivity, either hyperreactive or impaired reactions to sensory input, slower response times, impaired attention, poorer postural control, and difficulties with decision-making. They can have difficulties in memory, and may have frequent intrusive memories of events. It is common for people with StPD to feel &quot;déjà vu&quot; or as if they can accurately predict future events due to abnormalities in the brain&#x27;s memory storage.

== History ==
StPD was introduced in 1980 in the DSM-III. Its inclusion provided a new classification for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and of personality disorders that were previously unspecified. Its diagnosis was developed through differentiating the classifications of borderline personality disorder, of which some of the diagnosed population demonstrated schizophrenia-spectrum traits. When the separation of borderline personality disorder and StPD was originally suggested by Spitzer and Endicott, Siever and Gunderson opposed the distinction. Siever and Gunderson&#x27;s opposition to Spitzer and Endicott was that StPD was related to schizophrenia. Spitzer and Endicott stated &quot;We believe, as do the authors, that the evidence for the genetic relationship between Schizotypal features and Chronic Schizophrenia is suggestive rather than proven&quot;. StPD was included in the DSM-IV and the DSM-V and saw little change in its diagnosis.

== Epidemiology ==
The reported prevalence of StPD in community studies ranges from 1.37% in a Norwegian sample, to 4.6% in an American sample. A large American study found a lifetime prevalence of 3.9%, with somewhat higher rates among men (4.2%) than women (3.7%). It may be uncommon in clinical populations, with reported rates of up to 1.9%. It has been estimated to be prevalent among up to 5.2% of the general population. Together with other cluster A personality disorders, it is also very common among homeless people who show up at drop-in centers, according to a 2008 New York study. The study did not address homeless people who do not show up at drop-in centers. Schizotypal disorder may be overdiagnosed in Russia and other post-Soviet states.

== Prognosis ==
People with StPD usually had symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder in childhood. Traits of StPD usually remain consistently present over time, although can fluctuate greatly in severity and stability. DSM characterizes StPD as having nine major symptoms: ideas of reference, odd/magical beliefs, social anxiety, not having close friends, odd or eccentric behavior, odd speech, unusual perceptions, suspiciousness, schizo-obsessive behaviors and constricted affect. There may be gender differences in the symptomology of men and women with StPD. Women with the disorder might be more likely to have less severe cognitive deficits, and more severe social anxiety and magical thinking. People with StPD are more likely to only have a high school education, to be unemployed, and to have significant functional impairment. The two traits of StPD which are least likely to change are paranoia and abnormal experiences.

Compared to those without StPD, adolescents with StPD spend more time socialising on the Internet, such as on forums, chat rooms and cooperative computer games, and spend less time socialising in-person. People who are treatment-resistant to obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) behavioral therapy and medication that also display odd or eccentric behaviors could contribute to the coexistence of obsessive–compulsive disorder with schizotypal disorder.

== Etiology ==
=== Genetic ===
Although environmental factors likely play an important role in the onset of the disorder, people who have relatives with schizotypy, mood disorders, or other disorders on the schizophrenia spectrum are at a higher likelihood of developing StPD. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism and its Val or Met allele are suspected to be associated with Schizotypal personality disorder. These genes affect dopamine production in the brain, a neurochemical thought to be associated with schizotypal traits. The gene may also contribute to decreased levels of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex. This may lead to impaired capacities for decision-making, speech, cognitive flexibility, and altered perceptual experiences. The rs1006737 polymorphism of the CACNA1C gene is also believed to have a part in schizotypal symptoms. It may lead to a significantly increased physiological response to stress through the cortisol awakening response in the brain. It may also negatively affect reward processing in the brain and lead to anhedonia or depression in patients. These factors possibly lead to the development of Schizotypal traits. The zinc-finger protein ZNF804A likely affects the levels of paranoia, anxiety, and ideas of reference in StPD. This gene is also thought to negatively impact attention in people with StPD. It may lead to an increased level of white matter volume in the frontal lobe. Another gene, the NOTCH4 is thought to relate to Schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It can lead to disruptions in the occipital cortex, and therefore symptoms of schizotypy. The GLRA1 and the p250GAP genes are also potentially associated with StPD. It may lead to abnormally low levels of Glutamic acids in the NMDA receptors, which impairs memory and learning. StPD may stem from abnormalities in Chromosome 22.

=== Neurological ===
Exposure to influenza during week 23 of gestation is associated with a higher likelihood of developing StPD. Poor nutrition in childhood may also contribute to the onset of StPD by altering the course of brain development. Numerous areas of the brain are thought to be associated with StPD. Higher levels of dopamine in the brain, possibly specifically the D1 receptor, might contribute to the development of StPD. StPD is associated with heightened dopaminergic activity in the striatum. Their symptoms may also stem from higher presynaptic dopamine release. People with StPD may also have decreased volumes of grey or white matter in their caudate nucleus, which leads to difficulties in speech. People with StPD likely have a reduced volume in their temporal lobes, possibly specifically the left hemisphere. The reduced levels of gray matter in these areas may be linked to their negative symptoms. Reduced volume of gray or white matter in the superior temporal gyrus or the transverse temporal gyrus are thought to lead to issues with speech, memory, and hallucinations. Deficits in the gray matter volume of the temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex are likely associated with impairments in cognitive function, sensory processing, speech, executive function, decision-making, and emotional processing present in people with StPD. StPD symptoms may also be influenced by reduced internal capsule, which carries information to the cerebral cortex. People with StPD can also have impairments in the uncinate fasciculus, which connects parts of the limbic system. People with StPD have reduced levels of gray matter in their middle frontal gyrus and Brodmann area 10. Although, not as reduced as patients with Schizophrenia. Possibly preventing them from developing schizophrenia. Increased gyrification in gyri by the cerebellum may lead to dysconnectivity in the brain, and therefore, schizotypal symptoms. They may also have a hyporeactive, or hyperreactive amygdala. As well as hyperactive pituitary glands and putamens. It is also possible that lower capacities for prepulse inhibition plays a role in StPD. Research has suggested that people with StPD can have higher concentrations of Homovanillic acids. Abnormalities in the cave of septum pellucidum may also be present. In people predisposed to the development of Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the consumption of cannabis can induce the onset of StPD or other disorders with psychotic symptoms.

=== Environmental ===
Unique environmental factors, which differ from shared sibling experiences, have been found to play a role in the development of StPD and its dimensions. There is evidence to suggest that parenting styles, early separation, childhood trauma, and childhood neglect can lead to the development of schizotypal traits. Neglect, abuse, stress, trauma, or family dysfunction during childhood may increase the risk of developing schizotypal personality disorder. There is also evidence indicating that disruptions in brain development during the prenatal period could affect the development of StPD. Over time, children learn to interpret social cues and respond appropriately but for unknown reasons this process does not work well for people with this disorder. During childhood, people with StPD may have seen little emotional expression from their parents. Another possibility is that they were excessively criticized or felt like they were constantly under threat, potentially resulting in the onset of social anxiety, strange thinking patterns, and blunted affect present in StPD. Their difficulties in social situations might eventually cause the individual to withdraw from most social interactions, thus leading to asociality. Children with schizotypal symptoms usually are more likely to indulge in internal fantasies, more anxious, socially isolated, and more sensitive to criticism. People with the most severe cases of StPD usually have a combination of childhood trauma and a genetic basis for their condition.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Formal diagnostic criteria ===
StPD is characterized by 5 or more of the following:

* Ideas of reference (but not delusions of reference)
* Odd beliefs or magical thinking (e.g. the supernatural or special connection or bond to an abuser)
* Unusual perceptional experiences (hearing a voice, dissociative experiences, illusions, etc.)
* Odd thought and speech (e.g. jumping from one topic to another)
* Eccentric behavior and/or appearance
* Paranoid ideation
* Moods and facial expressions that don&#x27;t match each other or the situation
* Few to no close supports
* Excessive social anxiety that remains even with familiar people

These symptoms must have begun by early adulthood.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Differential diagnosis with the following disorders should also be considered:

* Other disorders with psychotic symptoms: (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depressive disorder with psychotic features)
* Paranoid, schizoid, or avoidant personality disorders
* Dissociative identity disorder (DID)
* Communication disorders

=== Screening ===
There are various methods of screening for schizotypal personality. The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) measures nine traits of StPD using a self-report assessment. The nine traits referenced are Ideas of Reference, Excessive Social Anxiety, Odd Beliefs or Magical Thinking, Unusual Perceptual Experiences, Odd or Eccentric Behavior, No Close Friends, Odd Speech, Constricted Affect, and Suspiciousness. A study found that of the participants who scored in the top 10th percentile of all the SPQ scores, 55% were clinically diagnosed with StPD. It has been adapted into a computerized adaptive version, known as the SPQ-CAT. A method that measures the risk of developing psychosis through self-reports is the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scale (WSS). The WSS divides schizotypal personality traits into 4 scales for Perceptual Aberration, Magical Ideation, Revised Social Anhedonia, and Physical Anhedonia. A comparison of the SPQ and the WSS suggests that these measures should be cautiously used for screening of StPD.

When screening for StPD, it is difficult to distinguish between schizotypal personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder. In order to develop better screening tools, researchers are looking into the importance of ipseity disturbance, which is characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum disorders such as StPD but not of autism.

=== Millon&#x27;s subtypes ===

Theodore Millon proposes two subtypes of schizotypal personality. Any individual with schizotypal personality disorder may exhibit either one of the following somewhat different subtypes (note that Millon believes it is rare for a personality to show one pure variant, but rather a mixture of one major variant with one or more secondary variants):

Millon&#x27;s typology of personality disorders was influential in the development of the DSM-III, particularly with respect to distinguishing between schizoid, schizotypal and avoidant personality disorders. These had previously been considered different surface-level expressions of the same underlying personality structure, and some psychologists, particularly those working in psychoanalytic or psychodynamic traditions, still take these personality disorders to be essentially similar.

=== Common comorbidities ===

* Antisocial personality disorder
* Avoidant personality disorder
* Bipolar disorder
* Borderline personality disorder
* Dysthymia
* Narcissistic personality disorder
* Obsessive–compulsive disorder 
* Major depressive disorder
* Paranoid personality disorder
* Post-traumatic stress disorder
* Schizoid personality disorder
* Schizophrenia
* Substance use disorders
* Social anxiety disorder
* Dissociative identity disorder

== Treatment ==

=== Medication ===

StPD is rarely seen as the primary reason for treatment in a clinical setting, but it often occurs as a comorbid finding with other mental disorders. When patients with StPD have prescribed pharmaceuticals, they are usually prescribed antipsychotics. However, the use of neuroleptic drugs in the schizotypal population is in great doubt. The antipsychotics which show promise as treatments for StPD include olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, and thiothixene. The antidepressant fluoxetine may also be helpful. While people with schizotypal personality disorder and other attenuated psychotic-spectrum disorders may have a good outcome with neuroleptics in the short term, long-term follow-up suggests significant impairment in daily functioning compared to schizotypal and even schizophrenic people without antipsychotic drug exposure. Positive, negative, and depressive symptoms were shown to be improved by the use of olanzapine, an antipsychotic. Those with comorbid OCD and StPD were most positively affected by the use of olanzapine and showed worse outcomes with the use of clomipramine, an antidepressant. Antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed, whether for StPD proper or for comorbid anxiety and depression. However, there is some ambiguity in the efficacy of antidepressants, as many studies have only tested people with StPD and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder or borderline personality disorder. They have shown little efficacy for treating dysthymia and anhedonia related to StPD. Both of these medications are the most frequently prescribed medication for StPD, though the use and efficacy of them should be evaluated differently for every case. The use of stimulants has also shown some efficacy, especially for those with worsened cognitive and attentional issues. Patients who have concurrent psychosis should be monitored more closely if stimulants are used as part of their treatment. Other drugs which may be effective include pergolide, guanfacine, and dihydrexidine.

=== Therapy ===
According to Theodore Millon, schizotypal personality disorder is one of the most straightforward personality disorders to identify but one of the most difficult to treat with psychotherapy. Cognitive remediation therapy, metacognitive therapy, supportive psychotherapy, social skills training and cognitive-behavioral therapy can be effective treatments for the disorder. Increased social interaction with others may be able to help limit symptoms of StPD. Support is crucial for schizotypal patients with predominant paranoid symptoms because they may have difficulties even in highly structured groups. Persons with StPD usually consider themselves to be simply eccentric or nonconformist; the degree to which they consider their social nonconformity a problem differs from the degree to which it is viewed as a problem in psychiatry. It is difficult to gain rapport with people with StPD because increasing familiarity and intimacy often increase their level of anxiety and discomfort. Therapy for StPD must be flexible to face emergencies or unique challenges.

Anderon&#x27;s first acting role was in the series &quot;Monsters&quot;, appearing in two episodes in 1988 and 1990.
Anderson appeared as The Man from Another Place in four episodes of David Lynch&#x27;s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, attired in a red suit and speaking in an unusual manner. 

Anderson had used phonetically reversed speaking as a secret language with his junior high school friends, and the same method was used in the series. Anderson would speak into a recorder. This was then played in reverse, and Anderson was directed to repeat the reversed original. This &quot;reverse-speech&quot; was then reversed again in editing to bring it back to the normal direction. This phonetic reversal created the strange cadences, rhythms and accentuation that set Cooper&#x27;s dream world apart from the real world. Lynch was unaware of Anderson&#x27;s familiarity with the phonetic reversal method when he cast Anderson in the part, and had hired a trainer to help with enunciation. When he found out Anderson could already talk backwards, he cancelled the trainer and wrote more difficult lines of dialogue for Anderson to read.

Anderson&#x27;s character first appears in Special Agent Dale Cooper&#x27;s cryptic dream about the murder of Laura Palmer, set in a red room. Anderson also appeared as the Man from Another Place in &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, the prequel film to &quot;Twin Peaks

In 1993, Anderson portrayed Rumpelstiltskin in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;If Wishes Were Horses&quot;, and appeared two years later in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Humbug&quot;&quot;.&quot; Anderson portrayed a man of average height in Lynch&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, using a prosthetic body. From 2003 to 2005, Anderson was a cast member of the TV series &quot;Carnivàle&quot;. Other television and film roles included &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show, Charmed, Cold Case&quot; and &quot;Adventure Time.&quot; Anderson retired from the acting industry in 2014, his last role being in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated.&quot;

== Controversies ==
In 2015, Anderson was asked to reprise his role as The Man from Another Place for &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&#x27; third season but declined over compensation. The character, instead, appears as a talking, CGI-created luminescent tree which is introduced as &quot;the evolution of the arm&quot; and voiced by an uncredited actor. When asked who provided the voice, executive producer Sabrina Sutherland replied, &quot;Unfortunately, I think this question should remain a mystery and not be answered.&quot;

In 2016, Anderson falsely accused Lynch of crimes ranging from pedophilia to rape and murder. His allegations against Lynch have never been corroborated or substantiated in any way. Lynch&#x27;s daughter acknowledged them in an Instagram post, wherein she said she hoped Anderson &quot;receives the help and peace he needs.&quot;

<doc id="542120" wikidata="Q923663" url="?curid=542120" title="Dolan's Cadillac (novella)">
<text>&quot;Dolan&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; is a novella by Stephen King. It was originally published in &quot;Castle Rock&quot;, King&#x27;s official newsletter, in monthly installments from February to June 1985. In 1993, &quot;Dolan&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; was collected in &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;. The story is narrated by the protagonist, a schoolteacher, and there is only one other main character, Dolan.

==Plot==
Robinson, the narrator, is a schoolteacher who lives in Las Vegas. He has become a widower after Dolan, a wealthy crime-boss, had his wife murdered with a car bomb in order to prevent her from testifying against him. The murder remains unsolved, and Robinson, unskilled in the arts of revenge, has no recourse. Over a seven-year period, however, Robinson—mentally haunted by his wife&#x27;s voice—devises a scheme of retaliation. 

Discovering that Dolan regularly takes the same route along State Route 71 when traveling to Los Angeles while in his Cadillac, Robinson decides to trick Dolan into missing a detour on his usual route and bury him in the car. Nothing else would even have a chance of working, as Dolan&#x27;s Cadillac is too well-armored against conventional threats, and Dolan himself is an intensely vigilant man. Robinson takes on an arduous summer job with a road paving crew so that he can learn to operate the heavy equipment needed to excavate an ditch just long and deep enough to contain the car, but not so wide as to allow escape through its doors. 

Circumstances align to ensure that a road work that Robinson can use will be occurring on an occasion that Dolan will be travelling along the highway over a Fourth of July holiday weekend, ensuring that Robinson can prepare the trap without fear of interruption, though the physical effort and mental strain of doing so single-handedly proves agonising to Robinson. On the night the plan is attempted, however, Robinson&#x27;s trap works flawlessly, and Dolan&#x27;s Cadillac drops into the pit as the altered section of road collapses under its weight. One of Dolan&#x27;s bodyguards is killed in the crash, while the other, crushed by the engine block, screams out in agony and panic, prompting Dolan to kill him. Robinson greets him and announces his intent on burying Dolan alive. Dolan addresses Robinson by name, luring Robinson to lean closer, narrowly missing as he fires a few bullets skyward. Robinson proceeds with the burial.

Dolan attempts to reason, negotiate, and finally plead for his freedom, gradually becoming less coherent as the sound of dirt cascading over the Cadillac&#x27;s roof erodes his sanity. Robinson takes no interest in any of Dolan&#x27;s offers, but does offer one of his own, promising to release Dolan if he can scream as loud as the explosives that killed Robinson&#x27;s wife. None of Dolan&#x27;s attempts are judged sufficient, and Robinson delightedly listens as Dolan&#x27;s mind crumbles. With what must be the last gasp of air left to him, Dolan screams out, &quot;For the love of God, Robinson!&quot; as the latter drops the last piece of paving into place.

The strain of his efforts takes a physical and mental toll on Robinson, causing him to collapse with exhaustion and a severely injured back. He manages to recover, never returning to roadwork, and a fortuitous sandstorm works to ensure that Dolan will remain hidden; his disappearance goes largely unmourned, and the press jokes that he is &quot;playing dominos or shooting pool somewhere with Jimmy Hoffa.&quot;

Robinson muses that one day, the sinkhole created by the buried Cadillac will cause the road above it to collapse, risking its discovery; however, the specifications Dolan ordered to protect himself will ironically ensure that this will not occur for a long while, and it may even just be covered over again. He notes that he occasionally drove along the same highway, and on the final occasion urinated on the spot where he believed Dolan was buried, but has since taken to driving an alternate route. He concludes by revealing that his wife&#x27;s voice no longer haunts him, which he finds a relief, but that he has occasionally glimpsed visions of Dolan&#x27;s emaciated corpse.

==Adaptations==
The 2008 film version of &quot;Dolan&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; was directed by Jeff Beesley, scripted by Richard Dooling and starred Christian Slater as Dolan, Wes Bentley as Robinson, and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Robinson&#x27;s wife. The film was shot in Regina and Moose Jaw. J-pop idol Crystal Kay performed its theme song, &quot;Hold On&quot;.

The audiobook version of this story was narrated by actor Rob Lowe.

==Influences==
*The line &quot;For the love of God, Robinson!&quot; is a direct reference to &quot;For the love of God, Montresor!&quot; from &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. &quot;Dolan&#x27;s Cadillac&quot; holds many ties to &quot;The Cask of Amontillado,&quot; chiefly in Robinson&#x27;s burial of Dolan.

<text>Ian Gardiner Waddell (November 21, 1942March 15, 2021) was a Canadian politician, author and filmmaker. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1979 to 1993, and in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1996 to 2001.

==Early life and career==
Waddell was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on November 21, 1942. His family immigrated to Canada when he was five. His father, Jack, worked as an electrician; his mother, Isabel, was employed as a waitress. The family moved to the suburbs of Toronto, initially staying in Scarborough, and later moved to Etobicoke. He studied history at the University of Toronto (UofT), graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1963. After receiving a teaching diploma from the Ontario College of Education that same year, he taught at Western Tech in Toronto. He then returned to UofT to study law, graduating with an LLB in 1967. Later he studied at the London School of Economics (LSE), from which he received a master&#x27;s degree in international law.

Critical of the Law Society of Upper Canada, Waddell moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where he articled at McTaggart, Ellis and Company. He worked as assistant city prosecutor for the City of Vancouver from 1971 to 1972, and then as a criminal defence lawyer. Later, as Legal Director at Community Legal Assistance Society, he was counsel on the first successful consumer class action in Canada. He went on to be counsel to Justice Tom Berger&#x27;s landmark Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry (1974–1977), before becoming partner at DeCario &amp; Waddell.

==Political career==
Waddell supported the Liberal Party of Canada in his youth; he joined the Liberal club during his time at UofT, and chauffeured party leader Lester Pearson during the 1962 federal election campaign. During his time at LSE, he became convinced of the merits of social democracy, and with the realization that the British Columbia Liberal Party had a more conservative stance, he came to support the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP), canvassing for that party&#x27;s candidates during the 1969 provincial election.

Waddell won the nomination as a New Democratic Party candidate in 1977, and ran for that party in the 1979 federal election, contesting the riding of Vancouver Kingsway. He won the seat with 45% of the vote, beating incumbent Liberal candidate Simma Holt, and was re-elected Member of Parliament (MP) for that riding in the 1980 and 1984 federal elections. He served as NDP&#x27;s energy critic at the time of the National Energy Program, before covering other portfolios such as economic development, employment, fisheries and communications.

During the patriation of the Canadian constitution, Waddell participated in drafting Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; and Section 92A of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;; the former provides constitutional protection to the indigenous and treaty rights of indigenous peoples in Canada, while the latter gave provinces greater control over non-renewable natural resources.

With the dissolution of Vancouver Kingsway, Waddell instead contested the newly established riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam in the 1988 federal election. He was elected MP for that riding, and served as NDP&#x27;s justice critic in the 34th Canadian Parliament. Following the resignation of Ed Broadbent as federal NDP leader in 1989, Waddell joined in the leadership race; he placed sixth in the first ballot before withdrawing. He sought re-election in Port Moody—Coquitlam in the 1993 federal election, but came in third with 21% of the vote, ending his 14-year career as MP.

As a BC NDP candidate in the 1996 provincial election, Waddell was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia to represent the riding of Vancouver-Fraserview, winning by 380 votes. He was appointed Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture in February 1998 by Premier Glen Clark. As minister, Waddell was responsible for the first Olympic bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler, beating out well financed Calgary and political favourite Quebec City. He brought in a film tax credit, which created a billion dollar film industry in BC. He subsequently served as Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks under Ujjal Dosanjh from November 2000 to April 2001. He lost the Vancouver-Fraserview seat to Liberal candidate Ken Johnston in the 2001 provincial election.

In the 2004 federal election, Waddell ran for re-election to Parliament in the reconstituted district of Vancouver Kingsway, losing to Liberal candidate David Emerson. At this time, Waddell came out as bisexual. In a rematch between the two in the 2006 federal election, Waddell once again lost to Emerson.

==After politics==
After leaving politics, Waddell worked as a consultant in environmental, governmental and aboriginal affairs. He was given the honorary title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in December 2013 for his exceptionally meritorious contribution to law. He also became a documentary film producer, winning the Best Producer Award in the 2016 Beverly Hills Film Festival alongside Dylan Playfair and Robert Lang for their film &quot;The Drop: Why Young People Don&#x27;t Vote&quot;.

Waddell released the political mystery novel &quot;A Thirst to Die For&quot; in 2002, and published his political memoir &quot;Take the Torch&quot; in 2018. He died on March 15, 2021, at his home in Vancouver from a heart condition at the age of 78.

<text>Wotje Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is a coral atoll of 75 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands.

==Geography==
Wotje&#x27;s land area of is one of the largest in the Marshall Islands, and encloses a lagoon of . The atoll is oriented east and west and is at its longest point, and at its greatest width. , the population was nearly 1,000, which included about 200 teenagers who live on the island at the public boarding school, Northern Islands High School. The population of the atoll was 816 at the 2021 census. The Wotje Atoll includes a number of islets, including Wotje (the largest), Bodao, Enejeltalk, Ukon, Wetwirok, Kaiken, Wormej, Kimajo, Ninum, Kaben. About 125 people live on Wodmej, which is approximately 8 miles from the main island of Wotje. All other islands are uninhabited and are used only for copra production, picnics, and food gathering.

==History==
First recorded sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos on 25 December 1542 that charted it as &quot;Los Corales&quot; (The Coral Islands in Spanish) because of the many corals and having anchored in these. One of the islets of this atoll was charted as &quot;San Esteban&quot; by Villalobos because they landed on it on St. Stephen&#x27;s day (26 December 1542).
Wotje Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. The Japanese established a school on the island, which served the atolls of the Ratak Chain, but otherwise left the administration in the hands of local authorities. 
However, from the end of the 1930s, Wotje was developed as into a major Japanese seaplane base, and also had an airfield with two runways for land-based aircraft, and several hundred support buildings. During World War II the atoll was garrisoned by the Japanese. The coasts were heavily fortified with coastal artillery and anti-aircraft batteries. The only bombing of Hawaii after Pearl Harbor was executed by seaplanes from Wotje. The Japanese garrison at Wotje at its peak numbered 2,959 men from the Imperial Japanese Navy, 424 men from the Imperial Japanese Army and some 750 civilian workers, many of whom were conscripted ethnic Koreans. From mid-1943 the island came under attack by United States Navy carrier-based aircraft and was frequently shelled by warships. The attacks increased in frequency and severity after the fall of Majuro and Kwajalein to American forces, and all supply lines to Wotje were cut. By the surrender of Japan, only 1244 men of the garrison remained alive.

Following the end of World War II, Wotje came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. Many World War II artifacts remain on the main island of Wotje, including a large concrete airstrip, bunkers and heavy artillery.

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates public schools.

Primary schools:
* Wodmej Elementary School
* Wotje Elementary School
* St. Thomas Elementary School (managed by Catholic Maryknoll Sisters) [Closed in June 2012]

High schools:
* Northern Islands High School

Higher Education
* College of the Marshall Islands extension campus [broke ground in 2020]

==Religion==
There are four churches on Wotje: Catholic, Protestant, Assembly of God, and Full Gospel. Additionally, there are a small number of Latter-Day Saints who live on the atoll.

==Transport==
Wotje is serviced by ships several times a year which transport food supplies. In addition, the local government and senator manage a small ship, &quot;Northern Star&quot;, which makes more frequent trips. Air services are provided by Air Marshall Islands to Wotje Airport.

<doc id="542141" wikidata="Q2784494" url="?curid=542141" title="Clerical marriage">
<text>Clerical marriage is the practice of allowing Christian clergy (those who have already been ordained) to marry. This practice is distinct from allowing married persons to become clergy. Clerical marriage is admitted among Protestants, including both Anglicans and Lutherans. Some Protestant clergy and their children have played an essential role in literature, philosophy, science, and education in Early Modern Europe.

Many Eastern Churches (Assyrian Church of the East, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, or Eastern Catholic), while allowing married men to be ordained, do not allow clerical marriage after ordination: their parish priests are often married, but must marry before being ordained to the priesthood. Within the lands of the Eastern Christendom, priests&#x27; children often became priests and married within their social group, establishing a tightly knit hereditary caste among some Eastern Christian communities. 

The Latin Catholic Church as a rule requires clerical celibacy for the priesthood since the Gregorian Reform in the late 11th century under the influence of Bernard of Clairvaux, but Eastern Catholic Churches do not require clerical celibacy for the priesthood and the Latin Catholic Church occasionally relaxes the discipline in special cases, such as the conversion of a married Anglican priest who wishes to be ordained a Catholic priest. (Celibacy is, however, a requirement to become a bishop.)

== History ==

There is no dispute among theologians that at least some of the apostles were married or had been married: a mother-in-law of Peter is mentioned in the account in , , of the beginning of Jesus&#x27; ministry. says: &quot;an overseer (Greek ἐπίσκοπος) must be ... the husband of one wife&quot;. This has been interpreted in various ways, including that the overseer was not allowed to remarry even if his wife died.

Evidence for the view that continence was expected of clergy in the early Church is given by the Protestant historian Philip Schaff, who points out that all marriages contracted by clerics in Holy Orders were declared null and void in 530 by Roman Emperor Justinian I, who also declared the children of such marriages illegitimate.

Schaff also quotes the account that &quot;In the Fifth and Sixth Centuries the law of the celibate was observed by all the Churches of the West, thanks to the Councils and to the Popes. In the Seventh and down to the end of the Tenth Century, as a matter of fact the law of celibacy was little observed in a great part of the Western Church, but as a matter of law the Roman Pontiffs and the Councils were constant in their proclamation of its obligation.&quot; This report is confirmed by others too. &quot;Despite six hundred years of decrees, canons, and increasingly harsh penalties, the Latin clergy still did, more or less illegally, what their Greek counterparts were encouraged to do by law—they lived with their wives and raised families. In practice, ordination was not an impediment to marriage; therefore some priests did marry even after ordination.&quot; &quot;The tenth century is claimed to be the high point of clerical marriage in the Latin communion. Most rural priests were married and many urban clergy and bishops had wives and children.&quot; Then at the Second Lateran Council of 1139 the Roman Church declared that Holy Orders were not merely a prohibitive but a diriment canonical impediment to marriage, therefore making a marriage by priests invalid and not merely forbidden.

The great East–West Schism between the Church of Rome and the four Apostolic sees of the Orthodox Communion (Constantinople, Alexandria Egypt, Antioch Syria, and Jerusalem) took place in 1054. As stated above, the majority of Roman Church priests at that time were married. Therefore, when some churches that followed Western rites and traditions were brought back into communion with the Orthodox Churches beginning in the 20th century, their right to have married clergy, provided they were married before ordination, was restored.

The practice of clerical marriage was initiated in the West by the followers of Martin Luther, who himself, a former priest and monk, married Katharina von Bora, a former nun, in 1525. It has not been introduced in the East. In the Church of England, however, the Catholic tradition of clerical celibacy continued after the Break with Rome. Under King Henry VIII, the Six Articles prohibited the marriage of clergy and this continued until the passage under Edward VI of the Clergy Marriage Act 1548, opening the way for Anglican priests to marry.

==Present-day practice==
Generally speaking, in modern Christianity, Protestant and some independent Catholic churches allow for ordained clergy to marry after ordination. However, in recent times, a few exceptional cases can be found in some Orthodox churches in which ordained clergy have been granted the right to marry after ordination.

===Protestant Churches===

Following the example of Martin Luther, who, though an ordained priest, married in 1525, Protestant denominations permit an unmarried ordained pastor to marry. They thus admit clerical marriage, not merely the appointment of already married persons as pastors. But in view of and , some do not admit a second marriage by a widowed pastor.

In these denominations there is generally no requirement that a pastor be already married nor prohibition against marrying after &quot;answering the call&quot;. Being married is commonly welcomed, in which case the pastor&#x27;s marriage is expected to serve as a model of a functioning Christian marriage, and the pastor&#x27;s spouse often serves an unofficial leadership role in the congregation. For this reason, some Protestant churches will not accept a divorced person for this position. In denominations that ordain both men and women, a married couple might serve as co-pastors.

Certain denominations require a prospective pastor to be married before he can be ordained, based on the view (drawn from 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1) that a man must demonstrate the ability to run a household before he can be entrusted with the church. Even in these strictest groups, a widower may still serve. This again concerns marriage before appointment as pastor, not clerical marriage.

===Eastern Churches===
The Assyrian, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches, as well as many of the Eastern Catholic Churches, permit married men to be ordained. Traditionally however, they do not permit clergy to marry after ordination. From ancient times they have had both married and celibate clergy (see Monasticism). Those who opt for married life must marry before becoming priests, deacons (with a few exceptions), or, in some strict traditions, subdeacons. 

The vast majority of Orthodox parish clergy are married men, which is one of the major differences between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches; however, they must marry before being ordained. Since the marriage takes place while they are still laymen and not yet clergy, the marriage is not a clerical marriage, even if it occurs while they are attending the seminary. Clerical marriage is thus not admitted in the Orthodox Church, unlike in the Protestant Churches. In the Russian Orthodox Church, the clergy, over time, formed a hereditary caste of priests. Marrying outside of these priestly families was strictly forbidden; indeed, some bishops did not even tolerate their clergy marrying outside of the priestly families of their diocese. In general, Eastern Catholic Churches have always allowed ordination of married men as priests and deacons. Within the lands of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the second largest Eastern Catholic Church, priests&#x27; children often became priests and married within their social group, establishing a tightly knit hereditary caste.
Traditionally, the rejection of clerical marriage has meant that a married deacon or priest whose wife dies could not remarry but must embrace celibacy. However, in recent times, some bishops have relaxed this rule and allowed exceptions. One way to do this is to laicize the widowed priest so that his subsequent marriage will be that of a layman (and hence not an instance of clerical marriage) and then allow him to apply for re-ordination.

Subdeacons (or hypodeacons, the highest of the clerical minor orders) are often included with clerics in major orders (like deacons and priests) in early canons that prohibit clerical marriage, such as Apostolic Canon 26. In light of these canons, several different approaches are used today to allow subdeacons to marry. One approach has been to bless acolytes or readers to vest and act as subdeacons temporarily or permanently, thus creating a new distinction between a &#x27;blessed subdeacon&#x27;—who may not touch the altar or assume other prerogatives of ordained subdeacons outside services—and an &#x27;ordained subdeacon&#x27;. Another approach is to simply delay the formal ordination of the subdeacon, if, for example, a likely candidate for the subdiaconate has stated an intention to marry but has not yet done so. Finally, sometimes the canons are simply ignored, thereby permitting even formally ordained subdeacons to marry.

Generally, if a deacon or priest divorces his wife, he may not continue in ministry, although there are also exceptions to this rule, such as if the divorce is deemed to be the fault of the wife.

Bishops in the Orthodox Churches are elected from among those clergy who are not married, whether celibate (as the monastic clergy must be) or widowed. If a widowed priest is elected bishop, he must take monastic vows before he can be consecrated.

===The Catholic Church===
Like the Eastern Churches, the Catholic Church does not allow clerical marriage, although many of the Eastern Catholic Churches do allow the ordination of married men as priests.

Within the Catholic Church, the Latin Church generally follows the discipline of clerical celibacy, which means that, as a rule, only unmarried or widowed men are accepted as candidates for ordination. An exception to this practice arises in the case of married non-Catholic clergymen who become Catholic and seek to serve as priests. The Holy See may grant dispensations from the usual rule of celibacy to allow such men to be ordained. For example, some married former Anglican priests and Lutheran ministers have been ordained to the priesthood after being received into the Church. The establishment of personal ordinariates for former Anglicans beginning in 2011 has added to such requests.

As in the Orthodox Churches, some Catholic priests receive dispensation from the obligation of celibacy through laicization, which may occur either at the request of the priest or as a punishment for a grave offense. Any subsequent marriage undertaken by the laicized former priest is thus considered to be the marriage of a layman, and not an instance of clerical marriage. In contrast to the Orthodox practice, however, such a married former priest may not apply to be restored to the priestly ministry while his wife is still living.

====Lack of enforcement for celibacy policy====

Despite the Latin Church&#x27;s historical practice of priestly celibacy, there have been Catholic priests throughout the centuries who have simulated marriage through the practice of concubinage. Repeatedly throughout church history, violations of the Catholic celibacy policy have not been grounds for defrocking.

The Vatican, it was revealed in February 2019, secretly enacted rules to protect the clerical status of Catholic clergy who violated their vow of celibacy. One example was shown in the Diocese of Greensburg in Pennsylvania, where a priest in the 1950s maintained his clerical status despite having &quot;married&quot; a 17-year-old girl (whom he had impregnated) by forging the signature of another priest on a marriage certificate only to &quot;divorce&quot; the girl months later. In 2012, Kevin Lee, a priest in Australia, revealed that he had maintained his clerical status after being secretly &quot;married&quot; for a full year and that church leaders were aware of his secret &quot;marriage&quot;, but disregarded the celibacy policy. The same year, former Los Angeles Auxiliary Bishop Gabino Zavala, who did not resign either from his post as Auxiliary Bishop or from the Catholic clergy until revelations that he fathered two children were made public, was implicated by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for having &quot;more than a passing relationship&quot; with the mother of his two children, who also had two separate pregnancies.

<text>Presidential elections were held in El Salvador on 21 March 2004. Antonio Saca of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party won the election with 57% of the vote, avoiding the need for a run-off on 2 May.

==Candidates==
There were two front-running candidates:
*Antonio Saca of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA). In his campaign, Saca embraced the free-market and pro-US policies followed by his predecessor and fellow &quot;&quot;, Francisco Flores. He was also the clear favorite of the Bush administration.
*Schafik Handal of the opposition Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). Handal sought to capitalize on discontent over slow economic growth, increasing crime, and income disparities between the poor and the tiny elite. He pledged to raise the tax burden on the rich and to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.

There were also two additional candidates. However, pre-vote opinion polls consistently placed both of them far behind the two leaders:
*Héctor Silva Argüello, the Christian Democratic Party–United Democratic Centre alliance candidate.
*José Rafael Machuca Zelaya, representing the Party of National Conciliation (PCN).

The election was monitored by 270 international observers and El Salvador&#x27;s own &quot;Tribunal Supremo Electoral&quot;, an institution created in 1992 to reform and validate the country&#x27;s electoral system. Some 17,000 police were on security duty during the election.

==Foreign interference==
The U.S. government under George W. Bush interfered in the elections by threatening a deterioration of the bilateral relations in case of a victory by FMLN&#x27;s candidate Schafik Handal. Bush&#x27;s Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Otto Reich, stated that the U.S. government was &quot;concerned about the impact that an FMLN victory could have on the commercial, economic, and migration-related relations of the U.S. with El Salvador.&quot;

==Results==
The voter turnout of 67% was the highest in Salvadoran history. The &quot;Tribunal Supremo Electoral&quot; confirmed Saca as the winner on Monday 22 March. Handal recognized Saca&#x27;s victory, but chose not to congratulate him. Saca announced his intention to seek reconciliation with the opposition FMLN, in an effort to heal old divisions from the country&#x27;s violent past. Saca selected Ana Vilma de Escobar to be his vice-president. She was previously the director of the Salvadoran Social Security Institute (ISSS). The new government took office on 1 June 2004.

<doc id="542146" wikidata="Q6696523" url="?curid=542146" title="Lucet">
<text>A lucet is a tool used in cordmaking or braiding which is believed to date back to the Viking and Medieval periods, when it was used to create cords that were used on clothing, or to hang items from the belt. Lucet cord is square, strong, and slightly springy. It closely resembles knitted I-cord or the cord produced on a knitting spool. Lucet may unravel if cut, but is easily fixed with a small knot. Unlike other braiding techniques such as , finger-loop braiding or plaiting, where the threads are of a finite length, lucetted (or knitted) braids can be created without pre-measuring threads and so it is a technique suited for very long cords.
==Origins of the lucet==

The supposed Medieval lucets appear to be double-pronged hollow bones, left tubular, presumably so that the cord could be drawn through the centre hole. In contrast, a modern lucet fork is lyre-shaped, normally made of wood, with two prongs at one end and (optionally) a handle on the other. It may also have a hole through which the cord can be pulled. 

The exact origins of the lucet are controversial. While it was previously suggested that its use declined after the 12th century and revived in the 17th century Its use waned again in the early 19th century, the historical identification of lucets in archaeological digs is tricky. The biggest challenge in identifying ancient lucets is that their design is simple, making it difficult to distinguish from other two-pronged tools. Many presumed lucets were made from bones, branches, or antlers, and are often misidentified by archaeologists.

For example, a two-pronged 11th-century finding from Lund (Sweden) has been associated with lucetting due to its design and runic inscription This artifact, despite having features that suggest its use in cordmaking, is debated among experts. In York, both bone and antler finds have been catalogued as lucets, although some, particularly the antler finds, are considered too impractical for weaving due to their divergent prongs and wear marks consistent with pendants.
The absence of a universally recognized shape for a lucet further complicates this identification. Findings range from hollow bones with two prongs, sometimes bearing a third larger prong, to small flat tools. Artifacts associated with medieval textile crafts, such as those found in Sigtuna (Sweden), Wandignies-Hamage (France), and other Northern European sites, have been re-examined through experimental archaeology, supporting their potential use as lucets, although doubts persist. Despite this, the term &#x27;lucet&#x27; has been applied to similar objects, especially those found in textile-related contexts.

==Construction of lucet braid==

A number of techniques exist for the creation of lucet cord, all of which produce slightly different cords; it is possible to produce a two-coloured cord by using two strands of differently-coloured yarn. The only materials necessary to lucet are yarn and a lucet fork, also known as a chain fork or a lucet. Skewer-like sticks or knitting needles can be used to pull the yarn over as an additional tool. Lucets can be bought in shops as kits designed for children.

To cast on, the yarn is put through the hole in the lucet from the front, and the yarn in front of the lucet is wound around the prongs twice, in a figure-of-eight motion. The two lower loops are then lifted over the two upper loops, using either the fingers or a stick, until they are lifted over the &#x27;horns&#x27; of the lucet fork, after which the thread behind the lucet is pulled to tighten the knot. The process is then repeated, this time (and every time after) winding the yarn just once around the prongs, as there is already a figure-of-eight of yarn on the fork.

When the desired length of lucet cord is reached, the lucet can be cast off by carefully lifting the loops off the prongs, passing the remaining thread through them, and pulling the knot tight. Any loose thread can be cut off with scissors, or tied together to form a closed circle. The cord can be wrapped around the lucet handle as it grows.

Lucet cord can be used for decorative edging, draw-strings, lacing, and any other use where a strong cord is needed.

<doc id="542149" wikidata="Q1157209" url="?curid=542149" title="Judith (poem)">
<text>The Old English poem Judith describes the beheading of Assyrian general Holofernes by Israelite Judith of Bethulia. It is found in the same manuscript as the heroic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the Nowell Codex, dated ca. 975–1025. The Old English poem is one of many retellings of the Holofernes–Judith tale as it was found in the Book of Judith, still present in the Catholic and Orthodox Christian Bibles. The other extant version is by Ælfric of Eynsham, late 10th-century Anglo-Saxon abbot and writer; his version is a homily (in prose) of the tale.

==History and incompleteness==
&quot;Judith&quot; was first discovered as an appendage to the Nowell Codex. Though it is certain that the poem is a derivative of the Book of Judith, still present in the Roman Catholic Bible, its authorship and year of origin remain a mystery.

The poem is incomplete: the version in the manuscript is 348 lines long, divided in three sections marked with the numbers X, XI, and XII. The numbers correspond to the 10th verse of chapter twelve, the 11th verse of chapter thirteen, and the 12th verse of chapter fourteen. Only the last three out of twelve cantos have been preserved. What remains of the poem opens in the middle of a banquet. Had the first nine cantos been preserved, it is often thought that &quot;Judith&quot; would be considered one of the most laudable Old English works.
What is certain about the origin of the poem is that it stems from the Book of Judith. After the Reformation, the Book of Judith was removed from the Protestant Bible. However, it is still present in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles. Many discrepancies exist between the poem and Book, most notably in regards to the portrayal of Holofernes and the exaggeration of Judith’s righteousness in the poem.

It is unknown when &quot;Judith&quot; became fragmented, but it is suggested that it was already fragmented when Laurence Nowell signed the manuscript in the 1500s. The quantity of the missing text is widely debated. Some scholars use the Apocryphal Judith as evidence for the text missing, while others refute this as unreliable as the Old English poet is not loyal to this source.

It is evident that the story of &quot;Judith&quot; has been modified and set within the framework of the Old English present. Much of the geographic and political structures relevant to a Hebrew culture have been removed or adapted, relevant to an Old English audience.

==Plot, structure and themes==
Like &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;Judith&quot; conveys a moral tale of heroic triumph over monstrous beings, if we follow the supposition of Andy Orchard’s &quot;Pride and Prodigies: Studies in the Monsters of the Beowulf Manuscript.&quot; Both moral and political, the poem tells of a brave woman’s efforts to save and protect her people. Judith is depicted as an exemplar woman, grounded by ideal morale, probity, courage, and religious conviction. Judith&#x27;s character is rendered blameless and virtuous, and her beauty is praised. In line 109, Judith is referred to as an &quot;ides ellenrof&quot;, &quot;a brave woman&quot;. The author gives her the entitlement of a &quot;halige meowle&quot; (line 56), &quot;holy woman&quot;, and a &quot;snoteran idese&quot; (line 55), &quot;wise woman&quot;, whilst her appearance is described as &quot;aelfscinu&quot; (line 13), &quot;elf-shining&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;. Although Judith kills a man, she appears to be doing God&#x27;s will; Holofernes, while described to some extent as a standard military leader in the Beowulfian vein, is also cast as a salacious drunk and becomes monstrous in his excess.

Portraying the epitome of Germanic heroism, &quot;Judith&quot; was likely composed during a time of war as a model for the Anglo-Saxon people. The Abbot Ælfric similarly created his own homiletic interpretation of the Book of Judith. At the time of his creation, Vikings were ransacking England. Ælfric professed that Judith was to serve as an example to the people. In a letter, Ælfric wrote: &quot;þeo is eac on English on ure wisan iset eow mannum to bisne, þet ge eower eard mid wæpnum beweriæn wið onwinnende here&quot;, meaning &quot;It is also set as an example for you in English according to our style, so that you will defend your land with weapons against an attacking force&quot;.

Ælfric’s Judith is quite like that of the poem; furthermore, the characters seem to have served the same purpose—to stand as an example to the people in a time of war. Judith&#x27;s city of Bethulia was being plundered by Assyrians. Holofernes was an Assyrian general and king, often drunk and constantly monstrous. 

The Vulgate Liber Iudith, the posited source text of these works, has been mutilated in order to contain the Anglo-Saxon heroic mode:

“Perhaps the most striking difference between the Old English Judith and the Vulgate version is
the setting of the story. In the Vulgate version of the story, Judith’s people, the citizens of Bethulia in particular and the Israelites in general, are shown as more religious than martial, led by priests and elders,rather than kings and generals. The Old English poet deliberately chose to place Judith in a more military setting. Thus, the seeming paradox of a woman as the military leader of her people is not just the result of a difficulty in adapting a biblical story to a Germanic heroic idiom.”

There are also key narrative details: the Old English Judith, after severing the head of Holofernes, proudly displayed his head to her Hebrew army and led them into a victorious battle against the Assyrians. In contrast, in the Book of Judith, the Assyrians simply fled Bethulia after discovering the deceased body of Holofernes.

== Poetic techniques ==
Judith contains many of the poetic techniques common to Old English poetry, including alliteration. The poem used the same kind of variation as do other Old English poems. An example is found in the description of God, who at various times is referred to as &#x27;ælmihtigan&#x27; (the Almighty), &#x27;mihtig Dryhten&#x27; (mighty Lord) and &#x27;Scyppende&#x27; (Creator).

==Destruction and preservation==
The only existing copy of the poem is in the Beowulf manuscript, immediately following &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Damage to the manuscript was caused by the Cotton fire of 1731 and readings have been lost. In order to account for these lost words, modern editions of the poem are supplemented by references to Edward Thwaites&#x27; 1698 edition.

==Authorship and date==
The consensus held by modern scholars allocates &quot;Judith&quot; to the authorship of Cynewulf, though several opposing theories have been proposed. The atypical absence of Cynewulf’s runic signature has led many not to attribute authorship to him. Stylistically, the poem so strongly reflects the Cynewulfian school that it may just as likely been written by one of Cynewulf’s successors. The existing manuscript text of &quot;Judith&quot;, following &quot;Beowulf&quot; in the manuscript, was copied by the second of two scribes.

== Palaeography ==
Much codicological and palaeographical evidence was lost in the Ashburnham House fire of 1731, including threads, folds and prick-marks. Studies in palaeography are, however, important and of interest when studying &quot;Judith&quot; and the constituent texts within the Nowell Codex, as the manuscript is written in two hands. &quot;Judith&quot; is in the hand of the second scribe, as is &quot;Beowulf&quot; from line 1939 onwards.

=== Orthography ===
In the Nowell Codex, the lack of scribal regularization is of note. The absence of &quot;-io&quot; spellings in &quot;Judith&quot; is of interest, in contrast to the ‘126’ &lt;io&gt; spellings in Beowulf, (totalling the pages transcribed by both A and B.) 

As Peter Lucas has demonstrated, Scribe A, who copied the first 87 MS pages of &quot;Beowulf,&quot; made sure to use regularised &lt;eo&gt; spellings in ‘The Letter of Alexander the Great to Aristotle’, (66 instances,) and &#x27;The Marvels of the East,’ (2 instances). 

Conversely, The Life of St Christopher does not contain any &lt;io&gt; spellings, which leads to Lucas’ claim, that it is “extremely probable that Quire 14, containing Judith, is the nearest surviving part of the manuscript to its lost beginning, and that the quire was linked to the present Quire by just one quire, designated *0, at least part of which was discarded only as relatively recently as c. 1600.”

<text>Mirwais Sadiq (1973 – March 21, 2004) was the Civil Aviation Minister of Afghanistan and the son of the Ismail Khan, who was then the governor of Herat Province.

He died during an exchange of fire in the city of Herat between supporters of Zahir Nayebzada, a commander for the central government, and Ismail Khan. Nayebzada claimed responsibility for the assassination, but insisted that Sadiq had only been killed in self-defense. President Hamid Karzai later said Sadiq&#x27;s death was caused by a &quot;small accident.&quot;

At least 100 people were said to have been killed in fighting immediately following after Sadiq’s death.

<text>Mili Atoll (Marshallese: , ) is a coral atoll of 92 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands. It is located approximately southeast of Arno. Its total land area is making it the second largest of the Marshall Islands after Kwajalein.

It encloses a much smaller lagoon than Kwajalein, with an area of . The atoll is separated by a water channel called the Klee Passage from the Knox Atoll which is considerably smaller.

The population of Mili Atoll was 497 at the 2021 census. The main village is also called Mili. Other villages include Nallu, Enejet, Lukonor, Tokewa, and Wau, Mili.

Nallu, Enejet and Lukonwor are accessible from Mili by land only during lowtide. Only Mili and Enejet have runways for small aircraft. Mili Airport and Enejit Airport are served by Air Marshall Islands when its aircraft are operational.

== History ==
The British merchant vessel &quot;Rolla&quot; sighted several islands in the Ratak and Ralik Chains. On October 20, 1803, she sighted islands at , which was possibly Mili Atoll. Captain Cummings sent in a cutter, but the heavy surf prevented it from landing. &quot;Rolla&quot; had transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales and was on her way to Canton to find a cargo to take back to Britain.

In the early 19th century, Mili and Knox Atolls were designated the Mulgrave Islands by Adam Johann von Krusenstern. In 1823 the mutinous crew of the whaler &quot;Globe&quot;, out of Nantucket, Massachusetts, brought their ship to Mili Atoll. The mutineers, led by Samuel B. Comstock, had killed &quot;Globe&quot;″s captain and her three officers. A few days after she anchored at Mili Atoll, Comstock was murdered by co-mutineer Silas Payne. Six of the crew fled in the ship, leaving nine men stranded on the island. By the time the U.S. schooner , commanded by Lieutenant Commander John Percival, arrived to rescue them two years later, the islanders had killed all but two of the crew members.

The infamous blackbirder Bully Hayes owned Tokowa Islet on Mili during the late 19th century and used it as a base for his operations. Mili Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885.

According to some theorists who advocate for the Japanese capture hypothesis of Amelia Earhart, Mili Atoll might have been where Earhart and Fred Noonan landed in 1937 after failing to make it to Howland Island. Evidence of this actually occurring, however, is largely based on unreliable eyewitness testimony rather than conclusive physical evidence; most historians believe Earhart and Noonan would have had no reason to attempt to come to Mili, and if they had, they would have run out of fuel before making it in any case.

=== World War II ===
After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Mili housed a radio direction finding beacon and a weather station and the atoll was fortified by the Japanese military. The garrison was composed of 2,045 men of the Imperial Japanese Navy and 2,237 men of the Imperial Japanese Army. In 1942 a seaplane base was developed. Between late 1942 and late 1943, the Japanese also constructed an airfield with three runways (4750 ft, 4550 ft and 4400 ft), and numerous support buildings, including a radar station. Korean and Marshellese forced laborers were used for the task; around 800 to 1,000 Koreans were moved to the island. The perimeter of the island was fortified with coastal defense and anti-aircraft guns. Between mid-1943 and August 1945, Mili was bombed by United States Navy carrier-based aircraft and shelled by warships. The attacks increased in frequency and severity after Majuro and Kwajalein had fallen to the United States. Of the 5100-man Japanese garrison (2600 Imperial Japanese Navy and 2500 Imperial Japanese Army) only half survived to the end of the war. On 22 August 1945 the Japanese garrison commander surrendered his forces on board the .

==== Alleged forced cannibalism and Korean rebellion ====
According to various testimonies published beginning in 2010 and affirmed by at least one Japanese researcher and by the South Korean government, amidst dwindling food supplies, in early 1945, Japanese soldiers gave Koreans &quot;whale meat&quot; to consume, which was actually human flesh from other dead Koreans. After learning the truth, the Koreans rebelled and killed 11 Japanese guards. The following day, Japanese troops from a neighboring island mounted a punitive attack. The Korean rebellion was quashed, and at least 32 were executed by firing squad and an additional 23 died by suicide. From 1942 to 1945, around 218 Koreans died on Mili Atoll.

=== Post-War ===
Following the end of World War II, Mili Atoll came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The island has been part of the independent Republic of the Marshall Islands since 1986.

Mili remains littered with thousands of World War II relics. The law forbids these items from being removed from the island. Mostly what remains are large bunker systems, rail systems, old artillery pieces and remnants of aircraft. Examples include Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zeros and a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber sitting in just several feet of water. The ground is still covered with craters created by the artillery campaigns that lasted 30 days to &quot;prep&quot; the island for the Allied invasion.

While thousands of unexploded munitions were destroyed by Peace Corps volunteers in the 1960s, danger remains for humans from chemicals in Japanese and U.S. unexploded munitions on land and in the ocean (which could enter the food chain).

<doc id="542158" wikidata="Q331447" url="?curid=542158" title="Marbled duck">
<text>The marbled duck or marbled teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris) is a medium-sized species of duck from southern Europe, northern Africa, and western and central Asia. The scientific name, &quot;Marmaronetta angustirostris&quot;, comes from the Greek &quot;marmaros&quot;, marbled and &quot;netta&quot;, a duck, and Latin &quot;angustus&quot;, narrow or small and &quot;-rostris&quot; billed.

==Distribution, habitat and breeding==
This duck formerly bred in large numbers in the Mediterranean region, but is now restricted to a few sites in southern Spain, southern Italy, northwest Africa and the broader Levant. Further east it survives in the Mesopotamian marshland in southern Iraq and in Iran (Shadegan Marshes - the world&#x27;s most important site), as well as isolated pockets in Armenia, Azerbaijan, South European Russia, western India and western China. In general the species has nomadic tendencies. In some areas birds disperse from the breeding grounds, and have been encountered in the winter period in the Sahel zone, south of the Sahara.

Its preferred breeding habitat is temporary and shallow fresh, brackish or alkaline waters with densely vegetated shores in regions that otherwise are fairly dry. It may also breed in coastal lagoons, along slow rivers or man-made waters like reservoirs. The on average 12 eggs are placed in a nest covered by dense vegetation at the waters edge. It is usually on the ground, but occasionally higher among reeds or on huts made from reeds. They are common in captive collections but are a nervous and flighty bird.

These are gregarious birds, at times even when nesting. Outside the breeding season flocks are often small, although large wintering flocks have been reported in some areas. The largest winter concentration known is in Khuzestan, Iran.

In 2011, a group of Iraqi ornithologists counted a single flock of the rare marbled teal on the lakes of the Iraqi marshes, numbering at least 40,000 birds.

==Description and diet==

The marbled duck is approximately long. Adults are a pale sandy-brown colour, diffusely blotched off-white, with a dark eye-patch and shaggy head. The female averages smaller than the male, but otherwise the sexes are alike. Juveniles are similar but with more off-white blotches. In flight, the wings look pale without a marked pattern, and no speculum on the secondaries.

These birds feed mainly in shallow water by dabbling or up-ending. Adults feed mostly on seeds (for example, from &quot;Scirpus&quot; and &quot;Ruppia&quot;), but also take significant quantities of invertebrates (especially aquatic insect larvae and pupae, tiny crustaceans, and—highly unusual for a duck—ants) and green plants (for example, &quot;Potamogeton&quot;). Their gizzard allows them to break down seeds and the lamellae in their beak allow them to filter feed on zooplanktonic organisms. Young marbled ducks feed mostly on invertebrates. Although they may take tiny seeds, they lack the large gizzard necessary to break down the larger seeds commonly consumed by adults.

==Conservation==
This bird is considered near threatened by the IUCN due to a reduction in population caused by habitat destruction and hunting. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="542168" wikidata="Q1353987" url="?curid=542168" title="Cohesion (computer science)">
<text>In computer programming, cohesion refers to the &quot;degree to which the elements inside a module belong together&quot;. In one sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the methods and data of a class and some unifying purpose or concept served by that class. In another sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the class&#x27;s methods and data.

Cohesion is an ordinal type of measurement and is usually described as “high cohesion” or “low cohesion”. Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable software traits including robustness, reliability, reusability, and understandability. In contrast, low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain, test, reuse, or understand.

Cohesion is often contrasted with coupling. High cohesion often correlates with loose coupling, and vice versa. The software metrics of coupling and cohesion were invented by Larry Constantine in the late 1960s as part of Structured Design, based on characteristics of “good” programming practices that reduced maintenance and modification costs. Structured Design, cohesion and coupling were published in the article &quot;Stevens, Myers &amp; Constantine&quot; (1974) and the book &quot;Yourdon &amp; Constantine&quot; (1979). The latter two subsequently became standard terms in software engineering.

== High cohesion ==

In object-oriented programming, a class is said to have high cohesion if the methods that serve the class are similar in many aspects. In a highly cohesive system, code readability and reusability is increased, while complexity is kept manageable.

Cohesion is increased if:
*The functionalities embedded in a class, accessed through its methods, have much in common.
*Methods carry out a small number of related activities, by &quot;avoiding&quot; coarsely grained or unrelated sets of data.
*Related methods are in the same source file or otherwise grouped together; for example, in separate files but in the same sub-directory/folder.

Advantages of high cohesion (or &quot;strong cohesion&quot;) are:
*Reduced module complexity, with fewer operations.
*Increased system maintainability, because logical changes in the domain affect fewer modules, and changes in one module require fewer changes in other modules.
*Increased module reusability, because application developers will find the component they need more easily among the cohesive set of operations provided by the module.

While in principle a module can have perfect cohesion by only consisting of a single, atomic element – having a single function, for example – in practice complex tasks are not expressible by a single, simple element. Thus a single-element module has an element that is either too complicated to accomplish a task, or too narrow and thus tightly coupled to other modules. Thus cohesion is balanced with both unit complexity and coupling.

== Types of cohesion ==
Cohesion is a qualitative measure, meaning that the source code is examined using a rubric to determine a classification. Cohesion types, from the worst to the best, are as follows:

;Coincidental cohesion (worst): Coincidental cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped arbitrarily. The only relationship between the parts is that they have been grouped together (e.g., a “Utilities” class). Example:
/*
Groups: The function definitions
Parts: The terms on each function
Module A {
 Implementation of r(x) = 5x + 3
 There is no particular reason to group functions in this way,
 so the module is said to have Coincidental Cohesion.
 r(x) = a(x) + b(x) 
 a(x) = 2x + 1
 b(x) = 3x + 2


;Logical cohesion: Logical cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they are logically categorized to do the same thing even though they are different by nature (e.g., grouping all mouse and keyboard input handling routines or bundling all models, views, and controllers in separate folders in an MVC pattern).

;Temporal cohesion: Temporal cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped according to the time in which they are processed. The parts are processed at a particular time in program execution (e.g., a function that is called after catching an exception that closes open files, creates an error log, and notifies the user).

;Procedural cohesion: Procedural cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they always follow a certain sequence of execution (e.g., a function that checks file permissions and then opens the file).

;Communicational/informational cohesion: Communicational cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they operate on the same data (e.g., a module that operates on the same record of information).

;Sequential cohesion: Sequential cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because the output from one part is the input to another part like an assembly line (e.g., a function that reads data from a file and processes the data).

;Functional cohesion (best): Functional cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they all contribute to a single well-defined task of the module (e.g., Lexical analysis of an XML string). Example:
/*
Groups: The function definitions
Parts: The terms on each function
Module A {
 Implementation of arithmetic operations
 This module is said to have functional cohesion because 
 there is an intention to group simple arithmetic operations
 on it. 
 a(x, y) = x + y
 b(x, y) = x * y

Module B {
 Module B: Implements r(x) = 5x + 3
 This module can be said to have atomic cohesion. The whole
 system (with Modules A and B as parts) can also be said to have functional
 cohesion, because its parts both have specific separate purposes. 
 r(x) = [Module A].a([Module A].b(5, x), 3)


;Perfect cohesion (atomic): Example.
/*
Groups: The function definitions
Parts: The terms on each function
Module A {
 Implementation of r(x) = 2x + 1 + 3x + 2
 It&#x27;s said to have perfect cohesion because it cannot be reduced any more than that.
 r(x) = 2x + 1 + 3x + 2


Although cohesion is a ranking type of scale, the ranks do not indicate a steady progression of improved cohesion. Studies by Larry Constantine, Edward Yourdon, and Steve McConnell indicate that the first two types of cohesion are inferior, communicational and sequential cohesion are very good, and functional cohesion is superior.

<doc id="542175" wikidata="Q1146480" url="?curid=542175" title="Nationalist Republican Alliance">
<text>The Nationalist Republican Alliance (, abbreviated ARENA) is a conservative, center-right to right-wing political party of El Salvador. It was founded on 30 September 1981 by retired Salvadoran Army Major Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson. It defines itself as a political institution constituted to defend the democratic, republican, and representative system of government, the social market economy system and nationalism.

ARENA controlled the National Assembly of El Salvador until 1985, and its party leader Alfredo Cristiani was elected to the presidency in 1989. ARENA controlled the presidency from 1989 until 2009. The party gained a plurality in the Legislative Assembly in 2012.

== History ==

The Nationalist Republican Alliance was founded on 30 September 1981 during the Salvadoran Civil War. Its founding leader was Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson, a former major in the Salvadoran Army who was most well-known for commanding various death squads and ordering the assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero in 1980. At the time of ARENA&#x27;s establishment, it was considered a far-right political party. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States described ARENA as &quot;reflect[ing] the personality&quot; of D&#x27;Aubuisson, and that the party&#x27;s primary goals were to defeat the far-left Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) and &quot;restore El Salvador to the days before the 1979 officers&#x27; coup&quot;.

The party&#x27;s initial membership primarily consisted of members of the (MNS) and the (FAN) opposed to the ruling Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) and the preceding government of the National Conciliation Party (PCN).

The party arose in response to &quot;the insurgency of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, FMLN, a group that united peasant farmers, unionists and intellectuals, which tried, through arms, to overthrow the dictatorship and to install a state regime inspired by the governments of revolutionary Cuba and Sandinista Nicaragua&quot;.

The ideology the party claims to believe in is a system of democratic and representative government, emphasizing individual rights, the family as the nucleus of society and the respect for private property.

In February 2007, three ARENA politicians were murdered in Guatemala, including Eduardo D&#x27;Aubuisson, the son of party founder Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson, in what was considered by the police as a crime related to drugs.

In 2009, ARENA took out a full-page ad in a Salvadoran newspaper calling on President Mauricio Funes to recognise the interim Honduran government of Roberto Micheletti installed after the military had expelled President Manuel Zelaya.

On 21 July 2022, Gustavo López Davidson, the leader of ARENA from August 2019 to February 2020, committed suicide amidst an ongoing investigation against him for embezzlement and arms trafficking.

From 2021 to 2024, the party was the second largest in the Legislative Assembly. Following the election of Nuevas Ideas&#x27; Nayib Bukele, the party has lost members of its party delegation to the ruling party.

== Structure ==

The National Executive Council (, abbreviated COENA) is the leadership board of ARENA. Carlos García Saade has been the president of COENA since 27 February 2023.

In addition to the COENA, there are 14 Directors-in-Chief, one for each department and departmental councils called &quot;Juntas Directivas Conjuntas&quot; to coordinate political work in their respective department. In each department, a director is chosen who works with a specific member of COENA. The director&#x27;s role is to organize and co-ordinate electoral campaigns and help the councils form party structures in the municipalities of their departments.

ARENA&#x27;s party headquarters is located at 2429 Arce Street &amp; North 45-47 Avenue in San Salvador. As of 2019, ARENA had 127,543 members.

== Electoral record ==

At the legislative elections held on 16 March 2003, the party won 32.0% of the popular vote and 27 out of 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly. ARENA&#x27;s successful candidate in El Salvador&#x27;s 2004 presidential election was Antonio Saca. On 21 March 2004, Saca defeated Schafik Hándal, the candidate of the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), by a margin of 58% to 36% with 70% turnout. He was sworn in as president the following 1 June.

In the 12 March 2006 legislative election, the party won 39.4% of the popular vote and 32 out of 84 seats. At the 18 January 2009 legislative elections, the party received 38.55% of the vote, and again won 32 of the 84 seats.

On 15 March 2009, ARENA candidate Rodrigo Ávila lost the presidential election to Mauricio Funes of the FMLN. After elections, the party president was changed to Alfredo Cristiani.

On 9 March 2014, Salvador Sánchez Cerén of FMLN narrowly defeated the ARENA candidate Norman Quijano by 0.2% in a run-off vote in a controversial election.

ARENA also lost both 2019 presidential election and 2021 legislative election dominated by Nuevas Ideas, the party of current president Nayib Bukele. In 2024 election, ARENA got only two seats in the Legislative Assembly, while Bukele&#x27;s Nuevas Ideas got supermajority.

<doc id="542178" wikidata="Q1009796" url="?curid=542178" title="Cohabitation (government)">
<text>Cohabitation is a system of divided government that occurs in semi-presidential systems, such as France, whenever the president is from a different political party than the majority of the members of parliament. It occurs because such a system forces the president to name a premier (prime minister) who will be acceptable to the majority party within parliament. Thus, cohabitation occurs because of the duality of the executive: an independently elected president &quot;and&quot; a prime minister who must be acceptable both to the president and to the legislature.

==France==
Cohabitation took place in France in 1986–1988, 1993–1995, and 1997–2002. The president faced an opposition majority in the National Assembly and had to select his government from them.

===Origins===

Cohabitation was a product of the French Fifth Republic, albeit an unintended one. This constitution brought together a president with considerable executive powers and a prime minister, responsible before Parliament. The president&#x27;s task was primarily to end deadlock and act decisively to avoid the stagnation prevalent under the French Fourth Republic; the prime minister, similarly, was to &quot;direct the work of government&quot;, providing a strong leadership to the legislative branch and to help overcome partisan squabbles.

Since 1962, French presidents have been elected by popular vote, replacing the electoral college, which was only used once. This change was intended to give Fifth Republic presidents more power than they might have had under the original constitution. While still seen as the symbol and embodiment of the nation, the president also was given a popular mandate. Of course, the majority party of the National Assembly retained power as well, but since the popularly elected president appointed the prime minister, the former was seen as having the upper hand in any conflict between executive and legislature. Furthermore, the imbalance is further illustrated by the fact that the president can dissolve the Assembly at any time (but not more than once in a year), whereas the legislature has no powers of removal against the president.

The sole caveat to this position of presidential pre-eminence was the fact that the president&#x27;s selection to the premiership required approval by the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament: because the assembly can dismiss the government by a vote of no confidence, it follows that the prime minister must command a majority in the assembly. This was not a problem whilst the legislative majority was aligned with the president, and indeed, de Gaulle, who was responsible for inspiring much of the Constitution, envisioned that the president would resign if the people disavowed him in an assembly election, and would then elect a new president (there is no vice-president in France) and a new election takes places less than two months after a resignation, a new president being elected for a new, full term; that happened in 1969, when de Gaulle resigned because the people voted against a referendum proposed by him.

The first &quot;near miss&quot; with cohabitation occurred with the election of Socialist President François Mitterrand in 1981. A right-wing coalition headed by the Gaullist Rally for the Republic controlled the assembly at the time. Almost immediately, Mitterrand exercised his authority to call assembly elections, and the electorate returned an assembly with an absolute majority of Socialists, ending the presumed crisis.

However, when assembly elections were held as required in 1986, five years later, the Socialists lost their majority to the right. Mitterrand decided to remain president, beginning the first cohabitation.

===Cohabitation in practice===
There have been only three periods of cohabitation, but each is notable for illustrating the oscillation of powers between the president and prime minister.

====Mitterrand–Chirac period (1986–1988)====

After the 1986 assembly elections, Mitterrand was forced to nominate as a Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, the leader of Rally for the Republic (RPR), the largest party in the majority coalition. Throughout the cohabitation between Mitterrand and Chirac, the president focused on his foreign duties and allowed Chirac to control internal affairs. Since Mitterrand was distanced from these policies, Chirac began to reverse many of Mitterrand&#x27;s reforms by lowering taxes and privatising many national enterprises. There were however tense moments, such as when Mitterrand refused to sign &quot;ordonnances&quot;, slowing down reforms by requiring Chirac to pass his bills through parliament. This lasted for two years until 1988 when the newly reelected Mitterrand called for new legislative elections that were won by a leftist majority, which lasted five years.

====Mitterrand–Balladur period (1993–1995)====

In 1993, President Mitterrand found himself in a similar position when the right won an 80% majority in the National Assembly elections. Once again, he was forced to appoint an opposition member from the RPR and Union for French Democracy (UDF) parties. This time he appointed Édouard Balladur to the post of prime minister, because Chirac was focused on running for president instead of being prime minister for the third time. Balladur maintained this post through the cohabitation until May 18, 1995 when Jacques Chirac took office as president.

====Chirac–Jospin period (1997–2002)====

In 1995, rightist leader Jacques Chirac succeeded Mitterrand as president, and, since the right had a majority in the assembly, he was able to appoint his fellow RPR member Alain Juppé as his prime minister, ending cohabitation by a change in the presidency. This alignment of president and assembly should have lasted until at least the normally scheduled 1998 assembly elections.

However, in 1997, President Chirac made the ill-fated strategic decision to dissolve parliament and call for early legislative elections. This plan backfired when the French electorate turned back to the leftists and removed the right-wing assembly majority. Chirac was forced to appoint Socialist Lionel Jospin to the premiership. Jospin remained prime minister until the elections of 2002, making this third term of cohabitation the longest ever, one of five years. Chirac called this a state of &#x27;paralysis&#x27;, and found it particularly difficult to arrange campaign activities for the National Assembly.

With Jospin holding the premiership, Chirac&#x27;s political influence was constrained and he had no say over certain major reforms being instituted by the left-wing majority. This included the 1998 legislation to shorten the working week from 39 to 35 hours, which came into effect in 2000.

===Observations===
Arend Lijphart contends that the French Fifth Republic usually operates under a presidential system, but when in cohabitation, this effectively changes, at least in terms of domestic policy, to a parliamentary system, in which the prime minister controls the legislative agenda and the president&#x27;s powers are limited to foreign policy and defence.

A common problem during cohabitation is that each leader wants his or her own policies to be carried out so that the public is positive toward their strategies, and he or she will be elected when the time comes. Because each party is in competition, there is little room for progression since the friction between both sides holds each other back. Whilst leaders of the same political spectrum help each other in decision-making when in power concurrently, cohabitation can lead to a decline in national authority and make the country appear outwardly insecure.

Although originally believed to be improbable, France was governed under a cohabitation of leaders for almost half the period from 1986 to 2006, suggesting that French people no longer fear the prospect of having two parties share power.

===Future prospects===
In 2000, at the initiative of prime minister Lionel Jospin and against the will of president Jacques Chirac, the term of a president was shortened from seven years to five years, a change accepted by a referendum. Furthermore, since 2002, legislative elections were now held roughly a month after presidential ones, thus creating a coattail effect that encourages those who won the presidential election to confirm their vote in the legislative elections.

The near-simultaneity of presidential and legislative elections makes cohabitation less likely by reducing the prospect of major changes in public opinion between the two elections, but cohabitation remains a possibility even if public opinion remains stable. For example, a group of voters (e.g. voters on the left) may be split between two or more presidential candidates, thus making it unlikely that any of this group&#x27;s candidates wins the presidential election, but these coordination problems may be resolved in the legislative election, leading to a different outcome in the two elections. Alternatively, a party that wins a majority of support in both the presidential and legislative elections may nonetheless fail to control the National Assembly because that support is distributed unequally across legislative districts. In another scenario, a presidential candidate from a new party may win the presidency despite his party not having the candidates or the party apparatus to win legislative elections.

Cohabitation can also occur if the presidential and legislative elections occur at different times due to extraordinary circumstances. For example, the president can dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections mid-term, as Emmanuel Macron did in 2024, which could theoretically lead to a different party winning. The president could also die, be incapacitated, resign, or be impeached during his term, leading to a new presidential election. Cohabitation could result, although the new president would then be likely to call new assembly elections.

==Elsewhere in Europe==

===Finland===
The Constitution of Finland, as written in 1918, was originally similar to the French system of 40 years later. It included explicit provisions that the president focuses on national security and international relations. The arrangement was a compromise between monarchists and parliamentarians. In essence, a strong presidency was adopted instead of a constitutional monarchy. The new constitution of 2000 reduced the power of the president by transferring the power to choose a prime minister to the parliament. Cohabitation has occurred frequently, as Finland has multiple powerful parties which are not highly polarized between left and right, and also since the terms of a parliament are shorter (four years) than the presidential terms (six years). Theoretically, the president should remain strictly non-partisan, and presidents have usually formally renounced party membership while in office.

===Georgia===
Georgia underwent a period of cohabitation from 2012 to 2013, occasioned by the defeat of the ruling United National Movement party by the opposition Georgian Dream coalition in the 2012 parliamentary election. At the same time, a new constitutional system came into effect and the leader of the defeated party, the incumbent President Mikheil Saakashvili, had to appoint the Georgian Dream leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, as prime minister. According to the European Commission report, with the expiration of Saakashvili&#x27;s two terms as president and the victory of the Georgian Dream candidate, Giorgi Margvelashvili, in the 2013 presidential election, Georgia completed a complex and peaceful transition from a &quot;presidential&quot; to a &quot;parliamentary&quot; system. The period of cohabitation was assessed in the same report as &quot;uneasy but functioning.&quot;

===Poland===

The president of Poland is required to be non-partisan while in office, but so far all presidents were elected as partisan candidates.

There have been seven periods of cohabitation in Poland, involving five presidents and seven prime ministers:

;Jaruzelski-Mazowiecki cohabitation (1990)
:In the partly free 1989 Polish parliamentary election, the opposition Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee won all the freely-contested seats in the Sejm (35% of the total membership); the remaining 65% were reserved to the ruling Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth, consisting of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) and its satellite parties, the United People&#x27;s Party (ZSL) and the Alliance of Democrats (SD). In a July article entitled &quot;Your President, Our Prime Minister,&quot; leading Solidarity member Adam Michnik proposed a grand coalition between Solidarity and reformist elements in PRON, in exchange for the former&#x27;s support for the election of PZPR general secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski as president (the president was to be elected by a joint session of parliament). Although this proposal was not initially followed - Jaruzelski was elected president by a narrow majority and without support from Solidarity, and attempted to appoint fellow PZPR member Czesław Kiszczak as Prime Minister - Solidarity convinced the ZSL and SD to break away from the PZPR and join it in a majority coalition; as a result, Kiszczak was dismissed by a vote of no confidence and replaced by Solidarity&#x27;s Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who proceeded to form a Solidarity-PRON grand coalition government in accordance with Michnik&#x27;s proposal. Eventually, on 6 July 1990, the PZPR withdrew from the coalition, leaving the government as a coalition of Solidarity, ZSL and SD only; president Jaruzelski continued to serve until December, when he resigned to allow direct presidential elections to take place; these elections were won by Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa, ending the period of cohabitation.

;Wałęsa-Pawlak/Oleksy cohabitation (1993–1995)
:A parliamentary election was held in September 1993, which led to the formation of a coalition government between the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL); the party formed by president Wałęsa to contest these elections, the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (BBWR), was relegated to the opposition. The relations between the two coalition partners were fraught, and Pawlak was replaced as prime minister by the SLD&#x27;s Józef Oleksy in a Cabinet reshuffle, with the SLD-PSL coalition retained. This period of cohabitation ended in December 1995, when President Wałęsa was defeated by Aleksander Kwaśniewski of the SLD in the presidential election.

;Kwaśniewski-Buzek cohabitation (1997–2001)
:At the 1997 parliamentary election, the SLD-PSL coalition lost its majority, which was taken by a new coalition between Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and the Freedom Union (UW), and headed by AWS&#x27; Jerzy Buzek as Prime Minister. In 2001, the Freedom Union withdrew from the coalition, leaving Buzek at the head of a single-party minority government; this government was defeated at the 2001 parliamentary election, where the SLD returned to government, forming a coalition with the PSL and the Labour Union (UP). During this cohabitation, president Kwaśniewski was re-elected in a landslide at the 2000 presidential election.

;Kwaśniewski-Marcinkiewicz cohabitation (2005)
:The 2005 parliamentary election marked a heavy defeat for the SLD, with a large center-right majority between two new parties, the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) and the centrist Civic Platform (PO). Although a coalition between the two parties was predicted to form after these elections, PiS opted instead for a minority government which enjoys confidence and supply from the PSL. In addition, PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński declined the prime ministership, fearing it would harm his brother Lech&#x27;s chances at the presidential election later that year. Instead, a lesser-known PiS politician, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, became prime minister. This period of cohabitation ended with Lech Kaczyński&#x27;s election as president; Marcinkiewicz would later resign the premiership in 2006 to be replaced by Jarosław Kaczyński, who again declined to form a coalition with PO, instead forming a majority coalition with Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (SRP) and the League of Polish Families (LPR).

;Kaczyński-Tusk cohabitation (2007–2010)
:A snap parliamentary election was called in 2007, following the breakdown of the PiS-SRP-LPR coalition government over corruption scandals. This snap election yielded a majority for PO and PSL, who formed a majority coalition with PO&#x27;s Donald Tusk - president Lech Kaczyński&#x27;s rival in the 2005 presidential elections - as prime minister. The relations between president Kaczyński and prime minister Tusk were very fraught, with the two constantly battling each other over who should represent Poland on the international stage. This cohabitation was brought to an end with president Kaczyński&#x27;s death in the Smolensk air disaster; Kaczyński&#x27;s death in office caused the 2010 presidential election to be brought forward by three months. PO&#x27;s Bronisław Komorowski, who already served as acting president following Kaczyński&#x27;s death, was elected president in his own right.

;Duda-Kopacz cohabitation (2015)
:In the 2015 presidential election, incumbent president Bronisław Komorowski was defeated in his attempt to gain a second term by PiS&#x27; Andrzej Duda. This cohabitation was brief, as the parliamentary election later that year resulted in PiS obtaining a single-party majority in the Sejm.

;Duda-Tusk cohabitation (2023–date)
:Although the 2023 parliamentary election resulted in PiS losing its parliamentary majority, president Andrzej Duda tried to reappoint incumbent prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki to a minority government. Two weeks later Morawiecki lost a no-confidence vote, and parliament appointed former prime minister Donald Tusk to a majority government, consiting of PO, the PSL, Poland 2050 (PL2050), and the New Left (NL; successor party of the SLD), and enjoying confidence and supply from the democratic socialist Left Together (RAZEM).

===Romania===
The 2012 Romanian political crisis was a major political conflict between Prime Minister Victor Ponta of the Social Democratic Party and the centre-right President Traian Băsescu, after the former was asked to form a government in May 2012. The dispute degenerated into civil disobedience and alleged democratic backsliding, lasting until the two sides signed an agreement on institutional cohabitation in December.

There have been six periods of cohabitation in Romania, involving two presidents and five prime ministers.

;Băsescu-Tăriceanu cohabitation (2007–2008)
:This cohabitation occurred owing to the dismissal of the ministers belonging to the Democratic Party (PD), which had supported President Băsescu&#x27;s candidacy, and which had counted Băsescu among its members before his election in 2004, in April 2007. This dismissal led to the formation of the second Tăriceanu government, comprising the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR). The coalition government, while commanding a minority of MPs, was externally supported by the Social Democratic Party (PSD). Tăriceanu&#x27;s term as prime minister ended in December 2008, following the legislative election the previous month, thus ending the cohabitation.

;Băsescu-Ponta cohabitation (2012–2014)
:The cohabitation between President Băsescu and Prime Minister Ponta began after the successful vote of no confidence against the government led by Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, which was supported by the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR). A new government took office, which included the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL) in May 2012, under the leadership of Victor Ponta. Ponta&#x27;s first term in office was marked by a major political crisis between him and President Băsescu, leading up to the suspension of the latter and an impeachment referendum in July 2012. The new parliamentary majority was reinforced after the legislative election in December 2012, as the Social Liberal Union (USL) obtained a supermajority of seats. The alliance eventually dissolved in February 2014. This period of cohabitation ended in December 2014, when President Băsescu left office, being replaced by Klaus Iohannis.

;Iohannis-Ponta cohabitation (2014–2015)
:President Klaus Iohannis began his term as President in December 2014, having won the presidential election a month before ahead of the incumbent prime minister, Victor Ponta. Since a legislative election was not held, the parliamentary majority was unchanged, and Ponta was able to remain as prime minister, despite his loss. Victor Ponta resigned in November 2015, being replaced by Dacian Cioloș.

;Iohannis-Grindeanu cohabitation (2017)
:A legislative election was held in December 2016, which led to the formation of a coalition government, including the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE). The leader of the Social Democratic Party, Liviu Dragnea, took the office of president of the Chamber of Deputies, while Sorin Grindeanu assumed the position of prime minister. Grindeanu was eventually dismissed by a vote of no confidence due to tensions within the governing coalition in June 2017, and he was replaced by Mihai Tudose, of the same party.

;Iohannis-Tudose cohabitation (2017–2018)
:The Tudose cabinet took office amid the dismissal of the previous cabinet, led by Sorin Grindeanu, in June 2017. The prime minister was Mihai Tudose, who had been the minister of economy in the previous government. It comprised the same parties which had participated in the Grindeanu government. Tudose chose to resign in January 2018, due to tensions within the governing coalition. He was replaced by Viorica Dăncilă.

;Iohannis-Dăncilă cohabitation (2018–2019)
:Viorica Dăncilă, a member of the European Parliament representing the Social Democratic Party, assumed the office of prime minister after the resignation of her predecessor, Mihai Tudose. She is the first female head of government of Romania.

===Russia===
In Russia, the State Duma has to approve a prime minister chosen by the president. However, if the State Duma rejects the president&#x27;s candidate(s) three times in a row the President has the right to dissolve the State Duma and call legislative elections, but he cannot do so within a year after the last election, which in this period may lead to cohabitation.

Though the rest of the time cohabitation is unlikely, it can occur when in the State Duma there is no stable majority loyal to the president. Thus, cohabitation evolved between 1998 and 1999, when the State Duma twice refused to appoint Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. However, since the appointment of the new prime minister was caused by the recent default, there was a risk that the opposition would improve its result after the snap election, which in turn would lead to even more tension between President Boris Yeltsin and the State Duma, especially since at this time preparations for the impeachment process were already underway. In consequence, Boris Yeltsin had to nominate Yevgeny Primakov for prime minister, who had broad support among the left opposition.

===Ukraine===
A cohabitation in a semi-presidential system also existed in Ukraine between 2006 and 2010. After 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had to appoint Viktor Yanukovych, his rival from the 2004 presidential election, as prime minister in August 2006.

==Asia==

===Palestinian National Authority===
The Palestinian National Authority, a quasi-governmental organization responsible for administering the Palestinian territories, has operated within the framework of a semi-presidential republic since the creation of the office of prime minister in the spring of 2003. While the president has the power to appoint anyone as prime minister, there was an unspoken agreement upon the establishment of the office that the prime minister would be appointed from the majority party in the Legislative Council. This arrangement led to a period of cohabitation after the 2006 legislative election, in which Fatah President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh prime minister after Hamas&#x27; victory in the elections. The cohabitation did not last long, however, as funds were withheld from the Palestinian Authority and hostilities between Fatah and Hamas broke out in December 2006, leading to the appointment of a caretaker government led by Salam Fayyad on June 14, 2007.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lankan politics for several years witnessed a bitter struggle between the president and the prime minister, belonging to different parties and elected separately, over the negotiations with the LTTE to resolve the longstanding civil war. Since 1978, Sri Lanka transferred from parliamentary system to semi-presidential system, which the president has more executive power.

==Other countries==
Cohabitation does not occur within standard presidential systems. While a number of presidential democracies, such as the United States, have seen power shared between a president and legislature of different political parties, this is another form of divided government. In this situation, the executive is directed by a president of one party who serves for a fixed term of years, even if and while the legislature is controlled by another party; in cohabitation, by contrast, executive power is divided between a president of one party and a cabinet of another party. Cohabitation thus only occurs in systems that have both parliamentary government (i.e. ministers accountable to parliament) and a directly elected executive president, i.e., semi-presidential systems. In a true parliamentary system, the head of state, whether president or constitutional monarch, has no significant influence over the government.

As seen above, the theory of cohabitation is no longer limited to France. However, there are not many countries where the constitutional structure exists in which it &quot;could&quot; occur. Since some of the new democracies of eastern Europe have adopted institutions quite similar to France, cohabitation may become more common, but if those countries elect their executives and legislature at or near the same time, as France is now doing, then cohabitation will be less likely.

<text>Lake Tisza (), also known as Kisköre Reservoir (Hungarian: &quot;Kiskörei-víztározó&quot;), is the largest artificial lake in Hungary. It is located at the southeastern edge of Heves county, next to counties Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, Hajdú-Bihar and Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok.

As part of the ongoing Tisza River flood control project, the Tisza Dam was built in 1973. Its filling was finished in the 1990s, resulting in a 127 km2 lake. The lake is 27 km in length, with an average depth of 1.3 m and a maximum depth of 17 m; it contains 43 km2 of small islands.

Following the reservoir&#x27;s completion, Hungarians began to flock to the site for holidays, since it compared favourably with the crowded and expensive Lake Balaton, the traditional holiday site. As a result, tourist infrastructure has been developed on the reservoir—renamed Lake Tisza—and the government has designated it an official tourism destination.

The lake (or reservoir) has a perfect ecology with a diversity of birds, plants, and animals. The &quot;Hortobágy National Park&quot; has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999.

Lake Tisza Ecocentre in Poroszló was erected to collect and display the nature and wildlife of the Tisza River valley and Lake Tisza. It was opened to the public on 27 April 2012.

<doc id="542190" wikidata="Q11163184" url="?curid=542190" title="Copy constructor (C++)">
<text>In the C++ programming language, a copy constructor is a special constructor for creating a new object as a copy of an existing object. Copy constructors are the standard way of copying objects in C++, as opposed to cloning, and have C++-specific nuances.

The first argument of such a constructor is a reference to an object of the same type as is being constructed (const or non-const), which might be followed by parameters of any type (all having default values).

Normally the compiler automatically creates a copy constructor for each class (known as an implicit copy constructor) but for special cases the programmer creates the copy constructor, known as a user-defined copy constructor. In such cases, the compiler does not create one. Hence, there is always one copy constructor that is either defined by the user or by the system.

A user-defined copy constructor is generally needed when an object owns pointers or non-shareable references, such as to a file, in which case a destructor and an assignment operator should also be written (see Rule of three).

== Definition ==

Copying of objects is achieved by the use of a copy constructor and an assignment operator. A copy constructor has as its first parameter a (possibly const or volatile) reference to its own class type. It can have more arguments, but the rest must have default values associated with them. The following would be valid copy constructors for class codice_1:

X(const X&amp; copy_from_me);
X(X&amp; copy_from_me);
X(volatile X&amp; copy_from_me);
X(const volatile X&amp; copy_from_me);
X(X&amp; copy_from_me, int = 0);
X(const X&amp; copy_from_me, double = 1.0, int = 42);

The first one should be used unless there is a good reason to use one of the others. One of the differences between the first and the second is that temporaries can be copied with the first. For example:

X a = X(); // valid given X(const X&amp; copy_from_me) but not valid given X(X&amp; copy_from_me)
 // because the second wants a non-const X&amp;
 // to create a, the compiler first creates a temporary by invoking the default constructor
 // of X, then uses the copy constructor to initialize as a copy of that temporary. 
 // Temporary objects created during program execution are always of const type. So, const keyword is required.
 // For some compilers both versions actually work but this behaviour should not be relied 
 // upon because it&#x27;s non-standard.

A similar difference applies when directly attempting to copy a codice_2 object:

const X a;
X b = a; // valid given X(const X&amp; copy_from_me) but not valid given X(X&amp; copy_from_me)
 // because the second wants a non-const X&amp;

The codice_3 form of the copy constructor is used when it is necessary to modify the copied object. This is very rare but it can be seen used in the standard library&#x27;s codice_4. A reference must be provided:

X a;
X b = a; // valid if any of the copy constructors are defined
 // since a reference is being passed.

The following are invalid copy constructors because codice_5 is not passed as reference (codice_6) :

X(X copy_from_me);
X(const X copy_from_me);

because the call to those constructors would require a copy as well, which would result in an infinitely recursive call.

The following cases may result in a call to a copy constructor:

# When an object is returned by value
# When an object is passed (to a function) by value as an argument
# When an object is thrown
# When an object is caught by value
# When an object is placed in a brace-enclosed initializer list

These cases are collectively called &quot;copy-initialization&quot; and are equivalent to:&lt;ref name=&quot;C++03 8.5/12&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (2003). &quot;ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ §8.5 Initializers [dcl.init]&quot; para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
codice_7

It is however, not guaranteed that a copy constructor will be called in these cases, because the C++ Standard allows the compiler to optimize the copy away in certain cases, one example being the return value optimization (sometimes referred to as RVO).

== Operation ==

An object can be assigned value using one of the two techniques:
* Explicit assignment in an expression
* Initialization

=== Explicit assignment in an expression ===

Object a;
Object b;
a = b; // translates as Object::operator=(const Object&amp;), thus a.operator=(b) is called 
 // (invoke simple copy, not copy constructor!)
=== Initialization ===

An object can be initialized by any one of the following ways.

a. Through declaration
Object b = a; // translates as Object::Object(const Object&amp;) (invoke copy constructor)
b. Through function arguments
type function(Object a);
c. Through function return value
Object a = function();

The copy constructor is used only for initializations, and does not apply to assignments where the assignment operator is used instead.

The implicit copy constructor of a class calls base copy constructors and copies its members by means appropriate to their type. If it is a class type, the copy constructor is called. If it is a scalar type, the built-in assignment operator is used. Finally, if it is an array, each element is copied in the manner appropriate to its type.

By using a user-defined copy constructor the programmer can define the behavior to be performed when an object is copied.

==Examples==

These examples illustrate how copy constructors work and why they are sometimes required.

===Implicit copy constructor===

Consider the following example:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Person {
 public:
 explicit Person(int age) : age(age) {}

 int age;

int main() {
 Person timmy(10);
 Person sally(15);

 Person timmy_clone = timmy;
 std::cout « timmy.age « &quot; &quot; « sally.age « &quot; &quot; « timmy_clone.age
 « std::endl;
 timmy.age = 23;
 std::cout « timmy.age « &quot; &quot; « sally.age « &quot; &quot; « timmy_clone.age
 « std::endl;


Output
 10 15 10
 23 15 10

As expected, codice_8 has been copied to the new object, codice_9. While codice_8&#x27;s age was changed, codice_9&#x27;s age remained the same. This is because they are totally different objects.

The compiler has generated a copy constructor for us, and it could be written like this:

Person(const Person&amp; other) 
 : age(other.age) // Calls the copy constructor of the age.
}

So, when do we really need a user-defined copy constructor? The next section will explore that question.

===User-defined copy constructor===

Consider a very simple dynamic array class like the following:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Array {
 public:
 explicit Array(int size) : size(size), data(new int[size]) {}

 ~Array() {
 if (data != nullptr) {
 delete[] data;
 }

 int size;
 int* data;

int main() {
 Array first(20);
 first.data[0] = 25;
 Array copy = first;
 std::cout « first.data[0] « &quot; &quot; « copy.data[0] « std::endl;
 } // (1)

 first.data[0] = 10; // (2)

Output
 25 25
 Segmentation fault

Since we did not specify a copy constructor, the compiler generated one for us. The generated constructor would look something like:

Array(const Array&amp; other)
 : size(other.size), data(other.data) {}

The problem with this constructor is that it performs a shallow copy of the &quot;data&quot; pointer. It only copies the address of the original data member; this means they both share a pointer to the same chunk of memory, which is not what we want. When the program reaches line (1), &quot;copy&#x27;s&quot; destructor gets called (because objects on the stack are destroyed automatically when their scope ends). 
&quot;Array&#x27;s&quot; destructor deletes the &quot;data&quot; array of the original, therefore, when it deleted &quot;copy&#x27;s&quot; data, because they share the same pointer, it also deleted &quot;first&#x27;s&quot; data. Line (2) now accesses invalid data and writes to it. This produces a segmentation fault.

If we write our own copy constructor that performs a &quot;deep copy&quot; then this problem goes away. 

// for std::copy
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

Array(const Array&amp; other)
 : size(other.size), data(new int[other.size]) {
 std::copy(other.data, other.data + other.size, data); 

Here, we are creating a new int array and copying the contents to it. Now, &quot;other&#x27;s&quot; destructor deletes only its data, and not &quot;first&#x27;s&quot; data. Line (2) will not produce a segmentation fault anymore.

Instead of doing a deep copy right away, there are some optimization strategies that can be used. These allow you to safely share the same data between several objects, thus saving space. The copy-on-write strategy makes a copy of the data only when it is written to. Reference counting keeps the count of how many objects are referencing the data, and will delete it only when this count reaches zero (e.g. codice_12).

==Bitwise copy constructor==
There is no such thing as &quot;bitwise copy constructor&quot; in C++. However, the default generated copy constructor copies by invoking copy constructors on members, and for a raw pointer member this will copy the raw pointer (i.e. not a deep copy).

==Logical copy constructor==

A logical copy constructor makes a true copy of the structure as well as its dynamic structures. Logical copy constructors come into the picture mainly when there are pointers or complex objects within the object being copied.

==Explicit copy constructor==
An explicit copy constructor is one that is declared explicit by using the explicit keyword. For example:

explicit X(const X&amp; copy_from_me);

It is used to prevent copying of objects at function calls or with the copy-initialization syntax.

<doc id="542197" wikidata="Q61624" url="?curid=542197" title="Rosi Mittermaier">
<text>Rosa Anna Katharina Mittermaier-Neureuther (; Mittermaier; 5 August 1950 – 4 January 2023) was a German alpine skier. She was the overall World Cup champion in 1976 and a double gold medalist at the 1976 Winter Olympics.

Mittermaier competed in alpine skiing from 1967 to 1976, retiring after a highly successful season in which she finished with two Olympic gold medals and ranked first in the World Cup. She remained popular, advertising for sports and as a non-fiction writer. She was known as &quot;Gold-Rosi&quot;, and she was inducted into Germany&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in April 2006 when it was initiated.

== Life and career ==
Mittermaier was born in Munich and grew up in Reit im Winkl on the . Her father had run there the Passauer Hütte. A certified skiing instructor, he also owned a skiing school from 1966, and was the first to train his daughters.

=== Racing career ===
Mittermaier made her World Cup debut in the inaugural season of 1967, and won her first World Cup race two seasons later.

She won two gold medals (downhill and slalom) and one silver (giant slalom) at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. Her victory in the Olympic downhill was the only downhill win in her international career. Mittermaier was the most successful athlete at those games, along with cross-country skier Raisa Smetanina of the Soviet Union, earning her the nickname of &quot;Gold-Rosi&quot; within Germany (then West Germany).

In addition to the overall World Cup title, she also won the season title in slalom and combined in 1976. After winning both races at Copper Mountain in Colorado to wrap up the overall and slalom titles, the four-year-old resort immediately named the race course run after her. In addition to her success in international competition, she also won 16 German national titles during her career.

On 31 May 1976, she retired from international competition at age 25, following the very successful 1976 season.

=== After racing ===
After her career in sports, Mittermaier joined Mark McCormack&#x27;s International Management Group as the only German alongside Jean-Claude Killy, Jackie Stewart, and Björn Borg. During her three-year contract, she designed a collection of winter sports clothing and made international appearances for various skiing products. She wrote non-fiction books, often together with her husband. She worked for several charities and occasionally as a commentator for German television for major sporting events. She established a charitable foundation to aid children with rheumatism in 2000.

=== Personal life and death ===
Mittermaier was born with a twin sister who died at birth. Her younger sister Evi Mittermaier also competed as an alpine skier and previously lived in a hotel. Rosi and Evi also recorded two albums of Bavarian folk songs together.

In 1980 she married Christian Neureuther, winner of six World Cup slalom races. They are the parents of Felix Neureuther (b. 1984), a World Cup ski racer for Germany, and a daughter Ameli who works as a fashion designer.

Mittermaier died because of cancer in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 4 January 2023, at the age of 72 years. Her mortal remains were cremated and the urn was buried at the cemetery of Garmisch. Next to her gravestone - a rock, which bears the inscription &quot;Rosi Mittermaier-Neureuther&quot; and resembles a mountain - is a similar one without inscription, which is obviously reserved for her husband.

== Awards ==
* 1976 German Sportswoman of the Year
* 1999 Olympic Order
* 2001 Goldene Sportpyramide of the 
* 2005 Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany
* 2006 Germany&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame
* 2007 Bavarian Order of Merit

She was an honorary citizen&#x27;s of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Reit im Winkl.

<doc id="542198" wikidata="Q3532117" url="?curid=542198" title="Alexandrov topology">
<text>In topology, an Alexandrov topology is a topology in which the intersection of every family of open sets is open. It is an axiom of topology that the intersection of every &quot;finite&quot; family of open sets is open; in Alexandrov topologies the finite qualifier is dropped.

A set together with an Alexandrov topology is known as an Alexandrov-discrete space or finitely generated space.

Alexandrov topologies are uniquely determined by their specialization preorders. Indeed, given any preorder ≤ on a set &quot;X&quot;, there is a unique Alexandrov topology on &quot;X&quot; for which the specialization preorder is ≤. The open sets are just the upper sets with respect to ≤. Thus, Alexandrov topologies on &quot;X&quot; are in one-to-one correspondence with preorders on &quot;X&quot;.

Alexandrov-discrete spaces are also called finitely generated spaces because their topology is uniquely determined by the family of all finite subspaces. Alexandrov-discrete spaces can thus be viewed as a generalization of finite topological spaces.

Because inverse images commute with arbitrary unions and intersections, the property of being an Alexandrov-discrete space is preserved under quotients.

Alexandrov-discrete spaces are named after the Russian topologist Pavel Alexandrov. They should not be confused with the more geometrical Alexandrov spaces introduced by the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov.

== Characterizations of Alexandrov topologies ==

Alexandrov topologies have numerous characterizations. Let X = &lt;&quot;X&quot;, &quot;T&quot;&gt; be a topological space. Then the following are equivalent:
*Open and closed set characterizations:
** Open set. An arbitrary intersection of open sets in X is open.
** Closed set. An arbitrary union of closed sets in X is closed.
*Neighbourhood characterizations:
** Smallest neighbourhood. Every point of X has a smallest neighbourhood.
** Neighbourhood filter. The neighbourhood filter of every point in X is closed under arbitrary intersections.
*Interior and closure algebraic characterizations:
** Interior operator. The interior operator of X distributes over arbitrary intersections of subsets.
** Closure operator. The closure operator of X distributes over arbitrary unions of subsets.
*Preorder characterizations:
** Specialization preorder. &quot;T&quot; is the finest topology consistent with the specialization preorder of X i.e. the finest topology giving the preorder ≤ satisfying &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; is in the closure of {&quot;y&quot;} in X.
** Open up-set. There is a preorder ≤ such that the open sets of X are precisely those that are upward closed i.e. if &quot;x&quot; is in the set and &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; then &quot;y&quot; is in the set. (This preorder will be precisely the specialization preorder.)
** Closed down-set. There is a preorder ≤ such that the closed sets of X are precisely those that are downward closed i.e. if &quot;x&quot; is in the set and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; then &quot;y&quot; is in the set. (This preorder will be precisely the specialization preorder.)
** Downward closure. A point &quot;x&quot; lies in the closure of a subset &quot;S&quot; of X if and only if there is a point &quot;y&quot; in &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; where ≤ is the specialization preorder i.e. &quot;x&quot; lies in the closure of {&quot;y&quot;}.
*Finite generation and category theoretic characterizations:
** Finite closure. A point &quot;x&quot; lies within the closure of a subset &quot;S&quot; of X if and only if there is a finite subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; lies in the closure of &quot;F&quot;. (This finite subset can always be chosen to be a singleton.)
** Finite subspace. &quot;T&quot; is coherent with the finite subspaces of X.
** Finite inclusion map. The inclusion maps &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; : X&quot;i&quot; → X of the finite subspaces of X form a final sink.
** Finite generation. X is finitely generated i.e. it is in the final hull of the finite spaces. (This means that there is a final sink &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; : X&quot;i&quot; → X where each X&quot;i&quot; is a finite topological space.)

Topological spaces satisfying the above equivalent characterizations are called finitely generated spaces or Alexandrov-discrete spaces and their topology &quot;T&quot; is called an Alexandrov topology.

== Equivalence with preordered sets ==

=== The Alexandrov topology on a preordered set ===

Given a preordered set formula_1 we can define an Alexandrov topology formula_2 on &quot;X&quot; by choosing the open sets to be the upper sets:

:formula_3

We thus obtain a topological space formula_4.

The corresponding closed sets are the lower sets:
::formula_5

=== The specialization preorder on a topological space ===

Given a topological space X = &lt;&quot;X&quot;, &quot;T&quot;&gt; the specialization preorder on &quot;X&quot; is defined by:

: &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; is in the closure of {&quot;y&quot;}.

We thus obtain a preordered set W(X) = &lt;&quot;X&quot;, ≤&gt;.

=== Equivalence between preorders and Alexandrov topologies ===

For every preordered set X = &lt;&quot;X&quot;, ≤&gt; we always have W(T(X)) = X, i.e. the preorder of X is recovered from the topological space T(X) as the specialization preorder.
Moreover for every &quot;Alexandrov-discrete space&quot; X, we have T(W(X)) = X, i.e. the Alexandrov topology of X is recovered as the topology induced by the specialization preorder.

However for a topological space in general we do not have T(W(X)) = X. Rather T(W(X)) will be the set &quot;X&quot; with a finer topology than that of X (i.e. it will have more open sets).
The topology of T(W(X)) induces the same specialization preorder as the original topology of the space X and is in fact the finest topology on &quot;X&quot; with that property.

=== Equivalence between monotonicity and continuity ===

Given a monotone function

:&quot;f&quot; : X→Y

between two preordered sets (i.e. a function

:&quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot;→&quot;Y&quot;

between the underlying sets such that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; in X implies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) in Y), let

:T(&quot;f&quot;) : T(X)→T(Y)

be the same map as &quot;f&quot; considered as a map between the corresponding Alexandrov spaces. Then T(&quot;f&quot;) is a continuous map.

Conversely given a continuous map

:&quot;g&quot;: X→Y

between two topological spaces, let

:W(&quot;g&quot;) : W(X)→W(Y)

be the same map as &quot;g&quot; considered as a map between the corresponding preordered sets. Then W(&quot;g&quot;) is a monotone function.

Thus a map between two preordered sets is monotone if and only if it is a continuous map between the corresponding Alexandrov-discrete spaces. Conversely a map between two Alexandrov-discrete spaces is continuous if and only if it is a monotone function between the corresponding preordered sets.

Notice however that in the case of topologies other than the Alexandrov topology, we can have a map between two topological spaces that is not continuous but which is nevertheless still a monotone function between the corresponding preordered sets. (To see this consider a non-Alexandrov-discrete space X and consider the identity map &quot;i&quot; : X→T(W(X)).)

===Category theoretic description of the equivalence===

Let Set denote the category of sets and maps. Let Top denote the category of topological spaces and continuous maps; and let Pro denote the category of preordered sets and monotone functions. Then

:T : Pro→Top and
:W : Top→Pro

are concrete functors over Set that are left and right adjoints respectively.

Let Alx denote the full subcategory of Top consisting of the Alexandrov-discrete spaces. Then the restrictions

:T : Pro→Alx and
:W : Alx→Pro

are inverse concrete isomorphisms over Set.

Alx is in fact a bico-reflective subcategory of Top with bico-reflector T◦W : Top→Alx. This means that given a topological space X, the identity map

:&quot;i&quot; : T(W(X))→X
is continuous and for every continuous map

:&quot;f&quot; : Y→X

where Y is an Alexandrov-discrete space, the composition

:&quot;i&quot; −1◦&quot;f&quot; : Y→T(W(X))

is continuous.

=== Relationship to the construction of modal algebras from modal frames ===

Given a preordered set X, the interior operator and closure operator of T(X) are given by:

:Int(&quot;S&quot;) = { &quot;x&quot; ∈ S : for all &quot;y&quot; ∈ X, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; implies &quot;y&quot; ∈ S }, and
:Cl(&quot;S&quot;) = { &quot;x&quot; ∈ X : there exists a &quot;y&quot; ∈ S with &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; }

for all &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;X.&quot;

Considering the interior operator and closure operator to be modal operators on the power set Boolean algebra of &quot;X&quot;, this construction is a special case of the construction of a modal algebra from a modal frame i.e. from a set with a single binary relation. (The latter construction is itself a special case of a more general construction of a complex algebra from a relational structure i.e. a set with relations defined on it.) The class of modal algebras that we obtain in the case of a preordered set is the class of interior algebras—the algebraic abstractions of topological spaces.

== Properties ==

Every subspace of an Alexandrov-discrete space is Alexandrov-discrete.

The product of two Alexandrov-discrete spaces is Alexandrov-discrete.

Every Alexandrov topology is first countable.

Every Alexandrov topology is locally compact in the sense that every point has a local base of compact neighbourhoods, since the smallest neighbourhood of a point is always compact. Indeed, if formula_6 is the smallest (open) neighbourhood of a point formula_7, in formula_6 itself with the subspace topology any open cover of formula_6 contains a neighbourhood of formula_7 included in formula_6. Such a neighbourhood is necessarily equal to formula_6, so the open cover admits formula_13 as a finite subcover.

Every Alexandrov topology is locally path connected.

== History ==

Alexandrov spaces were first introduced in 1937 by P. S. Alexandrov under the name discrete spaces, where he provided the characterizations in terms of sets and neighbourhoods. The name discrete spaces later came to be used for topological spaces in which every subset is open and the original concept lay forgotten in the topological literature. On the other hand, Alexandrov spaces played a relevant role in Øystein Ore pioneering studies on closure systems and their relationships
with lattice theory and topology.

With the advancement of categorical topology in the 1980s, Alexandrov spaces were rediscovered when the concept of finite generation was applied to general topology and the name finitely generated spaces was adopted for them. Alexandrov spaces were also rediscovered around the same time in the context of topologies resulting from denotational semantics and domain theory in computer science.

In 1966 Michael C. McCord and A. K. Steiner each independently observed an equivalence between partially ordered sets and spaces that were precisely the T0 versions of the spaces that Alexandrov had introduced. P. T. Johnstone referred to such topologies as Alexandrov topologies. F. G. Arenas independently proposed this name for the general version of these topologies. McCord also showed that these spaces are weak homotopy equivalent to the order complex of the corresponding partially ordered set. Steiner demonstrated that the equivalence is a contravariant lattice isomorphism preserving arbitrary meets and joins as well as complementation.

It was also a well-known result in the field of modal logic that a equivalence exists between finite topological spaces and preorders on finite sets (the finite modal frames for the modal logic S4). A. Grzegorczyk observed that this extended to a equivalence between what he referred to as &quot;totally distributive spaces&quot; and preorders. C. Naturman observed that these spaces were the Alexandrov-discrete spaces and extended the result to a category-theoretic equivalence between the category of Alexandrov-discrete spaces and (open) continuous maps, and the category of preorders and (bounded) monotone maps, providing the preorder characterizations as well as the interior and closure algebraic characterizations.
A systematic investigation of these spaces from the point of view of general topology, which had been neglected since the original paper by Alexandrov was taken up by F. G. Arenas.

<text>Jaluit Atoll (Marshallese: &#x27;, , or &#x27;, ) is a large coral atoll of 91 islands in the Pacific Ocean and forms a legislative district of the Ralik Chain of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Its total land area is , and it encloses a lagoon with an area of . Most of the land area is on the largest islet (motu) of Jaluit (10.4 km2). Jaluit is approximately southwest of Majuro. Jaluit Atoll is a designated conservation area and Ramsar Wetland.

In 2021 the population of the islands of Jaluit Atoll was 1,409. It was the former administrative seat of the Marshall Islands.

==History==

The British merchant vessel &quot;Rolla&quot; sighted Jaluit in 1803. She had transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales and was on her way to China to find a cargo to take back to Britain.

In 1885, the German Empire annexed Jaluit Atoll and the other Marshall Islands as protectorate. From 1888 to 1906 the islands were administered by the Jaluit Company on behalf of Germany’s colonial government. German imperial commissars (&quot;Kaiserliche Kommissare&quot;) included:

* 1886–1888 Dr. jur. Wilhelm Knappe (1855–1910)
* 1888–1888 Dr. Franz Leopold Sonnenschein (1857–1897)
* 1889–1891 Friedrich Louis Max Biermann 
* 1891–1894 Dr. Karl Wilhelm Schmidt (b. 4 March 1859 in Braunschweig) 
* 11 May 1894 – March 1898 Georg Irmer (b. 1853 – d. 1931)
* 24 March 1898 – 18 January 1906 Eugen Brandeis (b. 1846 – d. 1919) (acting to 22 February 1900)
* 18 January 1906 – May 1906 Ludwig Kaiser (acting) (b. 1862 – d. 1906)
* 1 April 1906 – 3 October 1914 the governors of German New Guinea; afterwards the jurisdiction was downgraded to district, under a &quot;Bezirksamtmann&quot;

After World War I, the island became a part of the South Seas Mandate, a mandated territory of the Empire of Japan, and was the seat of the Japanese administration over the Marshall Islands. Immigrants from Japan numbered several hundred by the 1930s. During World War II the island&#x27;s Japanese garrison consisted of 1,584 men of the Imperial Japanese Navy and 727 men of the Imperial Japanese Army. The island was bombed on at least five occasions in November and December 1943 by B-24 Liberator bombers of the USAAF 7th Air Force. The island became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands. 

From World War II until 1986, Jaluit came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

After World War II, the United States was engaged in a Cold War nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. The population of Bikini Atoll had agreed in 1945 to temporarily relocate to allow the U.S. to test then-new nuclear weapons at Bikini, which they were told were of great importance to humankind. 

The displaced islanders struggled for survival at several other Marshall Islands, including Rongerik Atoll, Ujelang Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll, and Kili Island. A decade later the U.S. suggested that some of the Bikini Islanders move to Jaluit. Three families moved there to produce copra for sale and other families rotated living there later on. Their homes on both Kili and Jaluit were struck by typhoons during 1957 and 1958, sinking their supply ship and damaging crops.

Jaluit remained under the control of the United States until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

==Geography==
Jaluit Atoll&#x27;s lagoon is shaped roughly like a kite.

The islet of Jabor (&quot;&quot;, ) has the largest population center on Jaluit Atoll, with a population of approximately 1,200. The island features a small hotel, small stores that sell staple foods, and a gasoline station. Jabor is a base for commercial and sports fishing, where motorboats can be rented. Snorkeling spots are around the sunken dock by the airport and in the northern pass into the lagoon.

Imiej (&quot;&quot;, ) is an islet a 45-minute boat ride from Jabor. It used to be the headquarters for the Imperial Japanese Navy garrison and was a major seaplane base. The ruins of the power station, barracks, antiaircraft guns and a Shinto shrine remain.

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates public schools.

High schools:
* Jaluit High School (JHS) - a boarding school that serves students from Jaluit Atoll and the southern atolls of Ebon, Ailinglaplap, Namu, Kili, Namdrik and Jabat.

Primary schools:
* Imiej Elementary School
* Imroj Elementary School
* Jabnoden Elementary School
* Jabor Elementary School - Jabor
* Jaluit Elementary School
* Mejrirok Elementary School
* Narmej Elementary School

Private schools:
Jabor has St. Josephs, attached to the Catholic Church.

==Transportation==
Jaluit Airport is served by Air Marshall Islands.

==Twin towns==
Jaluit is twinned with:
* New Taipei City, Taiwan, since 2019

<doc id="542202" wikidata="Q1346439" url="?curid=542202" title="Strictly Ballroom">
<text>Strictly Ballroom is a 1992 Australian romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann in his feature directorial debut. The film is the first in his &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy&quot; of theatre-motif-related films; it was followed by 1996&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;

&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; is based on a critically acclaimed stage play, originally set up in 1984 by Luhrmann and fellow students during his studies at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney. An expanded version of the play became a success at the Czechoslovakian Youth Drama Festival in Bratislava in 1986. In 1988, it had a successful season at Sydney&#x27;s Wharf Theatre, where it was seen by Australian music executive Ted Albert and his wife Antoinette. They both loved it, and, when Albert, soon after, set up the film production company M&amp;A Productions with ex-Film Australia producer Tristram Miall, they offered Luhrmann their plan to transform his play into a film. He agreed on the condition that he would also get to direct it.

==Plot==
Scott Hastings, the frustrated son of a family of ballroom dancers, has been training since the age of six. His mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio, while secretly watching old footage of his bygone dance competitions as well as Scott&#x27;s in a back room. Scott struggles to establish his personal style of dance to win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship, but his innovative and flashy &quot;crowd-pleasing&quot; steps are not considered &quot;strictly ballroom&quot;, and as such are denounced by Australian Dancing Federation head Barry Fife.

Scott and his dancing partner Liz Holt lose the Southern Districts Waratah Championships due to Scott dancing his own steps. Three days later, Liz leaves him to team up with Ken Railings, the recent Waratah Championships winner; his partner Pam Short has broken both her legs in a car accident. With Scott now alone only three weeks until the championships, Shirley teams up with his coach Les Kendall, her co-instructor at the studio, to start desperately hunting for a new partner for him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to both, Scott is approached by Fran, an overlooked &quot;beginner&quot; dancer at the studio. He eventually agrees to partner with her, intrigued by her willingness to dance &quot;his way&quot;.

The pairing faces its first hurdle when Fife, attempting to prevent Scott from threatening the Dancesport status quo, arranges for his partnership with established Champion dancer Tina Sparkle. When Shirley and Les hear the news, they are overjoyed. Fran, happening upon them exclaiming over their happiness about Scott&#x27;s new dance partner, misunderstands initially and believes they have discovered that she and Scott have become partners. When she realises the truth, she leaves, devastated. Scott pursues her and, although she is hurt, entices her to dance backstage with him, and her anger is forgotten. However, several onlookers witness their dance, including Shirley and Les, who then do everything possible to persuade both Scott and Fran that the best way forward for all concerned is for Scott to forget about Fran and sign on as Tina Sparkle&#x27;s partner.

Fran, accused of damaging Scott&#x27;s chances, reluctantly accedes and returns home crestfallen. Scott tells his mother he won&#x27;t dance with Tina. He follows Fran home, where her overprotective Spanish father, Rico, discovers and challenges him. To appease Rico, Scott proposes a Paso Doble for the assembled company. Rico and Fran&#x27;s grandmother Ya Ya demonstrate the proper Paso Doble technique and offer to teach the couple, who spend the next week training with Fran&#x27;s family. However, Fife intervenes, telling Scott that Doug (his father) ruined his own career by dancing his own steps, which he has regretted ever since. Unwilling to upset his parents further, Scott re-teams with Liz.

During the competition, Doug explains to Scott that Fife lied: Fife had convinced Shirley to dance with Les instead of Doug so that Fife could win the competition. It is also revealed that Fife is plotting to sabotage Scott in favor of audience favorite, Ken. Scott runs after Fran and persuades her to dance with him.

In the next round, Scott and Fran make a dramatic entrance and begin dancing, immediately riveting the audience. Fife tries to disqualify them, but Scott&#x27;s friend Wayne Burns, having overheard Fife&#x27;s treachery along with his partner Vanessa Cronin, disconnects the PA system, allowing Scott and Fran to dance a Paso Doble routine that impresses the audience. Desperate, Fife tries to turn off the music, but Scott&#x27;s younger sister Kylie and her partner Luke interfere until Fife&#x27;s girlfriend Charm Leachman disconnects the sound system. Fife then disqualifies Scott and Fran, but Doug begins clapping out a beat to enable the pair to continue dancing. The audience claps along, as Scott and Fran resume dancing. Liz, having had a , turns on Fife and Leachman and restores the music, and Scott and Fran&#x27;s spirited dancing brings down the house. Doug asks Shirley to dance with him and the whole audience joins them on the floor. As the performance finishes, Scott and Fran kiss.

==Production history==
The film version of &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was developed from an original short play of the same name. It drew on Luhrmann&#x27;s own life experience—he had studied ballroom dancing as a child and his mother worked as a ballroom dance teacher in his teens and inspired by the life of Keith Bain (who grew up in the same town as Luhrmann). While studying at NIDA in the early 1980s, Luhrmann and a group of fellow students devised a short comedy-drama set in the cutthroat world of competitive ballroom dancing. This original 1984 NIDA production was a critical success and, after graduating, Luhrmann was invited to re-stage the play for the Czechoslovakian Youth Drama Festival in Bratislava in 1986. He invited his school friend Craig Pearce to help him rewrite and expand the script. With its themes of artistic repression and underdogs battling against the odds, the play was a success at the festival, winning both the best director and best production awards.

This led Luhrmann to direct more theatre productions back in Australia, and in 1988, as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations, the Sydney Theatre Company invited him to establish an experimental theatre ensemble, Six Years Old, which took up a residency at The Wharf Theatre for that year. Alongside Luhrmann and Pearce, the new company included one of the original NIDA collaborators, actor Catherine McClements, plus production designer Catherine Martin (whom Luhrmann subsequently married), set dresser Bill Marron and costume designer Angus Strathie, all of whom went on to collaborate with Luhrmann on his films. The group work-shopped the expanded version of the play, which had a trial season at the Brisbane Expo in 1988 before opening at the Wharf Studios on 24 September 1988.

During its successful run at the Wharf, the play was seen by an influential Australian music executive. Ted Albert was a leading record producer and music publisher, best known in Australia as the discoverer and original producer of 1960s pop sensations The Easybeats. By the time he saw &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, Albert was the managing director of his family-owned music publishing company Albert Music (formerly J. Albert &amp; Sons) and its subsidiary, the highly successful record label Albert Productions, which scored a string of hits in the 1970s and 1980s with acts including John Paul Young and AC/DC.

Albert&#x27;s wife Antoinette (known as &quot;Popsy&quot;) took him to see the play after seeing a newspaper ad; they loved the energy, colour and musicality of the play and Ted Albert immediately saw the potential to develop the play into a film using the musical resources available to him through Alberts&#x27; publishing and recording enterprises. Soon after, Ted set up the film production company M&amp;A Productions with ex-Film Australia producer Tristram Miall; they tracked Luhrmann down through NIDA and approached him with the offer to transform his play into a movie. In its early stages, with the involvement of writer Andrew Bovell, the script took a more serious tone, including a subplot set around the trade union at the BHP Newcastle Steelworks. Luhrmann balked at the move towards naturalism and eventually, with Albert&#x27;s agreement, the director brought in his old friend Craig Pearce, who was able to translate Luhrmann&#x27;s theatrical vision into a workable screenplay.

The producers had difficulty in securing funding for the project, which mostly featured a cast of newcomers. The only &quot;bankable names&quot; in the cast were Barry Otto and screen veteran Bill Hunter, and although co-star Paul Mercurio was well known as a dancer through his work with the Sydney Dance Company, &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was his first acting role. With the original budget set at over AUD 5 million, government film funding bodies were reluctant to back such a left-field project with few major names in the credits. The script was then pared back and the subplot dropped, but when Miall approached the Film Finance Corporation, he was told that they would not back such a high-budget film (in Australian terms) with a first-time director. He was told to replace Luhrmann, but he refused, promising to make further cuts. Miall and Albert then pared the budget down to AUD 3.3 million and the FFA then agreed to provide around 65%, on condition that the producers were able to raise the remaining AUD 1 million and secure a local distributor. They sent Luhrmann to the Cannes Film Festival in hopes of finding an overseas distributor, but this came to nothing. After returning to Australia, Miall and Luhrmann had a fortuitous meeting with Andrew Pike, head of the Canberra-based independent distribution company Ronin Films. Intrigued by Luhrmann&#x27;s colourful pitch which involved sketches, set miniatures and pieces of costume, Pike agreed to back a limited local release, although he later admitted that, had he seen only the script, he would probably have turned it down.

Although the FFC funding was now in the pipeline, the production faced its most serious challenge when, on 11 November 1990, Ted Albert died suddenly from a heart attack (the film is dedicated to him). This threw the entire project into doubt, but Ted Albert&#x27;s widow Popsy decided that it should go to completion in honour of her husband, so she took over as executive producer, with Miall as producer. With her blessing, Ted&#x27;s family company Albert Music invested AUD 1 million, with the remaining AUD 300,000 sourced from private investors. Even after completion, the team were greeted with stiff resistance from exhibitors: Luhrmann recalled that one exhibitor walked out before the film had even finished, declaring that Luhrmann was ruined and that he would never work again.

The film was accepted for the Cannes Film Festival, but another tragedy struck just before its first screening—actress Pat Thomson, who played Scott&#x27;s mother, was diagnosed with cancer and she died in April 1992, only one month before its Cannes world premiere in May. &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; had its first public screening at midnight in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; programme and proved to be an instant hit—the cast and crew received a fifteen-minute standing ovation, which was repeated the following night; it became one of the major hits of the festival, winning the &quot;Prix De Jeunesse&quot; and triggering a bidding war among international distributors.

==Home video==
The film was released on DVD on 19 March 2002 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
 Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Not all major critics responded positively, with Australian film critic Adrian Martin calling it “amateurish and badly pitched in many respects“ while American Jonathan Rosenbaum referred to it as “wretched” and “one of the more horrific and unpleasant movies I’ve seen in quite some time”.

===Box office===
&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; previewed in Australia the week ending Wednesday, 19 August 1992 on 35 screens, grossing A$204,726 and finishing sixth at the Australian box office for the week. It officially opened on 20 August on 51 screens grossing A$1,216,376 in its opening week, placing at number 2 at the Australian box office, just behind &quot;Patriot Games&quot; on twice the number of screens. In its second week of release, it reached number one with a gross of A$1,307,825. It was knocked off number one the following week by &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; but returned in its sixth week of release after expanding to 85 screens where it remained for 7 weeks before being replaced by another local film, &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;. It was the highest-grossing film in Australia for the year with a gross of A$21,760,400 and the third highest-grossing Australian film of all time behind &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and its sequel. It grossed US$11,738,022 in the United States and Canada and eventually took A$80 million at the worldwide box office, making it one of the most successful Australian films of all time.

===Accolades===
&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and won the Youth Award for Foreign Film. It received thirteen nominations at the 1992 Australian Film Institute Awards and resulted in eight wins, including Best Film. The film earned eight nominations at the 46th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film; it won Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Original Film Music. It was also nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 51st Golden Globe Awards. 
In addition, the film was screened at several notable festivals to great critical acclaim, winning some major accolades, including the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Most Popular Film at the Vancouver International Film Festival.

<text>The Broken Ear (, originally published in English as Tintin and the Broken Ear) is the sixth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialised weekly from December 1935 to February 1937. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, as he searches for a stolen South American fetish, identifiable by its broken right ear, and deals with other thieves who are after it. In doing so, he ends up in the fictional nation of San Theodoros, where he becomes embroiled in a war and discovers the Arumbaya tribe deep in the forest.

&quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Black Island&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1943, &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was coloured and reformatted for republication by Casterman. Commentators have praised the book for showcasing Hergé&#x27;s then-newfound commitment to a clear narrative structure and strives for historical and technical accuracy, but believe that its use of humour comparable to earlier &quot;Adventures&quot; renders it inferior to the previous volume, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; introduces the recurring character General Alcazar, and was the first to include fictional countries. The story was adapted for both the 1956 Belvision animation, &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

==Synopsis==
A fetish created by the Arumbaya tribe of South America is stolen from Brussels&#x27; Museum of Ethnography, only to be returned the following day. Tintin realizes that the replacement is a fake, and draws a connection with a local sculptor, Jacob Balthazar, who has just been murdered. Balthazar&#x27;s parrot – the only witness to the murder – is obtained by two Hispanic men, Alonso and Ramón, who try to kill Tintin when he begins to investigate their connection to the crime. From the parrot, Alonso and Ramón discover Balthazar&#x27;s murderer is Rodrigo Tortilla, and they proceed to follow him aboard a ship bound for South America. There, they murder Tortilla, but find that he did not have the original fetish. Tintin, however, follows them, and arranges their arrest when the ship docks at Los Dopicos, capital of San Theodoros. Nevertheless, the corrupt colonel in charge of the arrest allows the antagonists to slip away, and detains Tintin.

In the city, Tintin is framed as a terrorist, arrested, and sentenced to death by firing squad. Tintin survives when a revolution topples the government, and the new leader, General Alcazar, appoints Tintin to be his aide-de-camp. Alonso and Ramón capture Tintin, and interrogate him in the hope of locating the missing fetish, but they only end up briefly put behind bars by him. As aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes the proposed decision of San Theodoros claiming the supposedly oil rich Gran Chapo, as this would cause a war between San Theodoros and neighboring Nuevo Rico, and he is framed as a traitor by warmongering oil and weapon companies. Nevertheless, Tintin&#x27;s new friend Pablo frees him from imprisonment, allowing for Tintin to flee to Nuevo Rico. However, in the process, he inadvertently causes events that have Nuevo Rico start a war between it and San Theodoros. 

Once within Nuevo Rico, Tintin decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbaya tribe, hoping they can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish. Finding a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was hidden inside the statue. At the check-in counter, Tintin and Snowy were due to leave South America for Europe but missed the ferry crossing as they had to wait for another week. As the war between San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico ends when Gran Chapo is discovered to have no oil, Tintin returns to Belgium after a brief encounter with Alonso and Ramón. There, Tintin discovers Balthazar&#x27;s brother has been producing a range of exact replicas of the fetish, which he had discovered among his deceased brother&#x27;s belongings. Tintin learns it was purchased from him by Samuel Goldbarr, a wealthy American now returning to the United States with it by ship. Catching up to the boat, Tintin finds Alonso and Ramón aboard. His struggle with them for the possession of the fetish results in it smashing on the floor, and the diamond hidden in it rolling overboard into the sea. Alonso and Ramón try to kill Tintin for making them lose it, and the three of them accidentally fall overboard as well. Tintin is rescued, but Alonso and Ramón drown. Goldbarr allows Tintin to return the stolen fetish to the museum, where it is repaired and put back on display, albeit comically damaged.

==History==

===Background and research===
Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was employed as editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels which was run by the &quot;Abbé&quot; Norbert Wallez. In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip for , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin. Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union as anti-socialist propaganda for children (&quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;), to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (&quot;Tintin in America&quot;). Wallez was subsequently removed from the paper&#x27;s editorship following a scandal, although Hergé was convinced to stay on the condition of a salary increase. In preparing &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, Hergé developed the new habit of keeping plot notes and ideas in a notebook. He also began making cuttings of photographs and other images from magazines and newspapers, filing them away for future use; he used them as a basis for many of the drawings in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;.

Hergé used &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; to allude to real events that had recently taken place in South America. The fictional countries of San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico were based on the real countries Bolivia and Paraguay, while the Gran Chapo War depicted in the strip was an allusion to the Chaco War (1932–35) that was waged between Bolivian and Paraguayan forces over lucrative oil fields in the Gran Chaco region. The name &quot;Gran Chapo&quot; was a pun on the French &quot;grand chapeau&quot;, meaning &quot;big hat&quot;, while the name Nuevo Rico was a pun on &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and the name of the Nuevo Rican capital city, Sanfación, was a pun on &quot;sans façon&quot;, meaning &quot;without manners&quot;. Hergé&#x27;s character Basil Bazarov, of the Vicking Arms Company Ltd (Basil Mazaroff in the 1937 edition), was a thinly veiled allusion to the real-life Greek weapons seller Basil Zaharoff of Vickers Armstrong, who profited from the conflict by supplying arms to both Paraguay and Bolivia. Hergé had learned about the conflict and the western corporations profiting from it through two issues of anti-conformist French magazine &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot; (&quot;The Mortar Shell&quot;), which covered news stories ignored by the mainstream media. It is also likely that he had read Richard Lewinsohn&#x27;s 1930 book &quot;Zaharoff, l&#x27;Européen mystérieux&quot; (&quot;Zaharoff, the Mysterious European&quot;), which had been referenced in &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot;.

Hergé&#x27;s Arumbaya fetish was based on the design of a genuine Peruvian statue in Brussels&#x27; Royal Museums of Art and History; a pre-Columbian Chimu statue, it was made of wood and dated to between 1200 and 1438 CE. Whereas Hergé had access to speakers of Mandarin when creating &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, he had no access to speakers of indigenous Amerindian languages, and as such, the Arumbaya language that he developed was entirely fictitious. He based its structure largely on the Brusseleir dialect spoken in the Marolles area of Brussels, mixed with Spanish endings and constructions. In developing the Arumbaya&#x27;s rivals, the Bibaros, he was influenced by anthropological accounts of head shrinking among the Jibaros tribes; when Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner translated the book into English, they renamed the Bibaros as the Rumbabas, a pun on the rum baba pudding. The explorer Ridgewell, found living among the Arumbayas is based upon the British explorer Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, who mysteriously disappeared into the Amazon jungle in 1925.
In crafting the story, Hergé was possibly influenced by &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, as there are similarities in their plots.

===Original publication===

&quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was first serialised in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; from December 1935 under the title &quot;Les Nouvelles Aventures de Tintin et Milou&quot; (&quot;The New Adventures of Tintin and Snowy&quot;). From 7 February 1937, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; under the name &quot;Tintin et Milou chez les Arumbayas&quot; (&quot;Tintin and Snowy among the Arumbayas&quot;). In 1937, it was collected in a single hardcover volume and published by Éditions Casterman under the title &quot;L&#x27;Oreille cassée&quot; (&quot;The Broken Ear&quot;). For this collected edition, one small change was made; the minor character of Carajo was renamed Caraco, because the word &quot;carajo&quot; is Spanish slang for penis, due to the fact Hergé had been unaware of its actual definition during the publication.

&quot;The Broken Ear&quot; introduced the character General Alcazar to the series, who went on to become a recurring character who appeared in three further &quot;Adventures&quot;. As noted by Hergé biographer Harry Thompson, &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; is the first story in the &quot;Tintin&quot; series to &quot;start and finish in home surroundings&quot; and the first to deal with the pursuit of a MacGuffin. It also marks the last story in which Tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity and the first time that the &quot;Adventures&quot; featured Tintin&#x27;s flat at 26 Labrador Road, in which Chinese mementos from &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; are visible. Influenced by Alfred Hitchcock and his frequent cameo appearances in his own films, Hergé inserted an illustration of himself into the second frame. He also made reference to contemporary news stories in the book, having a radio announcer discuss the ongoing Second Italo-Ethiopian War at the start of the story; this was removed in the colour edition. At the end of the story, Hergé killed off Ramón and Alonso and depicted them being dragged to Hell by devils; this would mark the last depiction of the death(s) of a villain in the series until Colonel Boris Jorgen&#x27;s death in &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;. This upset the editors of &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, who asked Hergé to change the scene; annoyed at their request, he later commented: &quot;On the surface it cost me nothing, but that kind of addition was really difficult for me&quot;. For their serialisation of the story, he replaced that particular frame with one in which Tintin vouchsafed the souls of Ramón and Alonso for God.

===Second version, 1943===
In the 1940s and 1950s, when Hergé&#x27;s popularity had increased, he and his team at Studios Hergé redrew and coloured many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures using the (&quot;clear line&quot;) drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was the first of these early &quot;Adventures&quot; to undergo the reformatting and colouration, and this second edition was published as a 62-page volume by Casterman in 1943. Unlike some of the earlier adventures, &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was not redrawn, save for a few minor revisions. To reduce the length of the book, various sections were excised, including a dream sequence that appeared in the original. As the colouration process was new to the series, the use of colour in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; is more basic than in later volumes; as the book progresses, it is evident that Hergé lost interest and rushed the task, for instance, resorting to using block colour backgrounds without any detail.

===Later publications and legacy===
Casterman republished the original black-and-white version in 1979 in a French-language collected volume with &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, the second part of the collection. In 1986, Casterman published a facsimile version of the original.

Hergé returned to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent &quot;Adventures&quot;, such as Syldavia and Borduria (based largely on Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany) in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; and Sondonesia (based on Indonesia) in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;. He also re-used other elements pioneered in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; in his later &quot;Adventures&quot;: a parrot in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, a ravine crash in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, a fireball and vivid dream in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, and a firing squad in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;. Tintin returned to San Theodores in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance.

In 1979, the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels held an exhibition marking fifty years of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. As part of this, they included artefacts that featured in the series, with the broken-eared Peruvian statue that inspired Hergé&#x27;s Arumbaya fetish as the centre piece of the show; however, they feared that it might be stolen, so a replica was exhibited rather than the genuine article. Imitating the events of &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, a thief broke in and stole the statue. A letter was then sent to &quot;Le Soir&quot; in which an individual alleging to be the thief stated that the item would be returned if Hergé returned to the scene of the crime at a certain time with a copy of the book under his right arm. Hergé did so, but carried the book under his left arm; the thief never appeared, and the replica fetish was never recovered.

==Critical analysis==

Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier described &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; as &quot;a &quot;Blue Lotus&quot;-lite&quot;, noting that it shared many elements with the previous &quot;Adventure&quot;, although they also considered it to be &quot;more reminiscent of the earlier, more caricatured books&quot; like &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; and &quot;Tintin in America&quot; with the inclusion of comical natives and absurdist elements like &quot;comical bombs&quot;. They nevertheless thought that it exhibited a &quot;marked improvement&quot; in Hergé&#x27;s use of plotting, noting that the story was clearly structured, praising the &quot;very effective, dramatic story, with plenty of twists&quot;. Overall, they awarded &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; two stars out of five. Harry Thompson felt that &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; had a &quot;slightly lacklustre quality&quot; to it, and was &quot;disappointing&quot; due to the fact that the &quot;various elements don&#x27;t gel well together&quot;. He believed that the artistic quality and the use of research deteriorated as the &quot;Adventure&quot; progressed, although it had &quot;the most complex plot yet, by a long way&quot;. Philippe Goddin asserted that in the story, Tintin develops from a &quot;classic reporter to an investigative journalist.&quot;

Michael Farr described &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; as a &quot;moral condemnation of capitalism, imperialism and war&quot;, although felt that it was &quot;not as perfectly constructed&quot; as &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, being &quot;less detailed and realistic&quot;. He thought that the image in which Ramón and Alonso drown in the sea and are dragged to Hell by demons was &quot;truly medieval&quot; and represented the &quot;most fanciful image&quot; in the entire series. He also opined that Hergé&#x27;s depiction of South American militaries was &quot;full of humour&quot; and that the detail was &quot;generally very accurate&quot;.
Biographer Benoît Peeters thought that &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was a return to &quot;pure adventure&quot; from the &quot;quasi-documentary realism&quot; of &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, and that in this &quot;Adventure&quot;, politics remains &quot;in the second line&quot;, and that instead Hergé let &quot;the narrative rip and succeeds marvellously&quot;. Elsewhere, he praised the work as having a &quot;formidable dynamism&quot; and an &quot;unequaled vitality&quot;, containing a &quot;revolution&quot; in narrative structure. He thought that it served as a &quot;perfect metaphor&quot; for the theories of German philosopher Walter Benjamin published in &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (1936), which Hergé had not read.
Literary critic Tom McCarthy thought that Balthazar was an example of the interesting minor characters that imbue the &quot;Adventures&quot;, commenting that his &quot;down-at-heel garret speaks volumes of loneliness and semi-realised artistry&quot;. He also opined that the diamond within the fetish was the clitoris of the Arumbaya, describing it as &quot;their pleasure, wrapped up in a fetish&quot;. He also thought that there was a homosexual subtext between Ramón and Alonso, believing that the scene in which a bullet was fired into Ramón&#x27;s buttocks was symbolic of anal sex.

Writing in &quot;Libération&quot;, the philosopher Michel Serres opined that &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was &quot;a treatise on fetishism&quot;.
Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University believed that &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; established a &quot;tintinian&quot; anthropology that would remain throughout the rest of the series. As part of this, Apostolidès argued, Hergé distances himself from western values and looks at his own society as an outsider, accomplishing what Roger Caillois called &quot;sociological revolution&quot;. He felt that the comic was &quot;more contrived&quot; and &quot;more superficial&quot; than the previous &quot;Adventures&quot;, and that here Tintin loses his position as &quot;the sole point of identification&quot; for the reader, with the other characters becoming more identifiable. Opining that there was a constant theme of twos throughout the story (i.e. the real and the fake fetish, Alonso and Ramón), he thought that the character of Ridgewell was &quot;a kind of Tintin, grown old among the natives, solitary and ill humored&quot;, noting that Ridgewell&#x27;s position among the Arumbayas was akin to Tintin&#x27;s position among the Ba Baorom in &quot;Congo&quot;. Apostolidès also argued that in the comic, Alcazar was a religious figure, who attained a &quot;sacred&quot; quality through the spilling of blood in his revolt against General Tapioca&#x27;s government. As part of this, he argued that the threats of assassination would make him a martyr, or a &quot;holy king&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Broken Ear&quot; is one of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; that were adapted for the first series of the animated &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot; by the Belgian studio Belvision in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Michel Greg. &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; was divided up into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverted from Hergé&#x27;s original plot in a variety of ways.

It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin. The episode deviates significantly from the original story line. The passage containing Tintin&#x27;s drunkenness has been ignored entirely, keeping the character consistent with how it is seen in the rest of series - upright, conscientious and of commendable moral standards. Besides, the political narratives, almost ubiquitously present in the latter part of the original album, have also been largely overlooked. Tintin&#x27;s conflict with the military was also replaced with one with Alonso Pérez and Ramón Bada. Pérez and Bada do not die at the end of the story, as occurs in the album, but are rescued by Tintin as he is retrieved from the sea by the ship&#x27;s crew, and taken to prison.

Tintin critic Tom McCarthy stated in an interview that the plot of his novel &quot;Men in Space&quot; was &quot;more or less lifted straight&quot; from &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;. Like &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, &quot;Men in Space&quot; concerns an artist hired to reproduce a priceless artwork; however he ultimately produces more than one copy, fooling the conspirators.

<text>Egged Transportation Ltd (, ) is the largest transit bus company in Israel. Egged&#x27;s intercity bus routes reach most Israeli cities, towns, kibbutzim and moshavim, and the company operates urban city buses throughout the country. It also operates in Poland and the Netherlands through a subsidiary.

Egged provides about 35% of Israel&#x27;s public transport services, employs about 6,500 workers and operates a fleet of 2,950 buses. Egged buses transport about 900,000 passengers per day.

== History ==

Egged was created in 1933 through a merger of four smaller intercity bus cooperatives in and around Tel Aviv. In 1942, it was joined with the bus company &quot;United Sharon&quot;. In 1951, Egged merged with the Northern &quot;Shahar&quot; bus company and the Southern &quot;Drom Yehuda&quot; bus company, creating a national public transportation network. In 1961, Egged merged with the &quot;Hamekasher&quot; bus company of Jerusalem. The name &quot;Egged&quot; (lit. &quot;Union&quot;) was given to the cooperative by the Israeli poet Hayim Nahman Bialik.

During the wars of 1956, 1967 and 1973, Egged buses and drivers helped to reinforce the logistics system of the IDF and drove soldiers and food to the battlefields. Some buses also served as ambulances to transport injured soldiers and civilians. 

In late 2002, Egged sued the Palestinian National Authority and its chairman Yasser Arafat for compensation of damages and loss of income due to terrorist attacks and suicide bombings on buses during the Second Intifada, claiming that the attacks had deterred passengers from taking buses. On February 3, 2003, the Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Arafat had to pay Egged NIS 52 million in damages for the loss of one year&#x27;s income and NIS 100,000 in court expenses.

Despite deregulation attempts by the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Egged is still Israel&#x27;s largest bus company, is subsidized by the government, and still controls most of the inter-city bus lines in Israel. Netanyahu&#x27;s attempts were cut short by a bus strike that brought the country to a halt, and Egged&#x27;s workers and directors declared that any further attempts to undermine the company&#x27;s monopoly will be met with similar measures. However, in recent years, many bus lines have begun to be operated by smaller bus companies such as Dan, Kavim, Superbus, Connex and others. In 2005, Egged and the Israeli Government reached an agreement under which by the year 2015 subsidization will be reduced to specific sectors, the disabled, soldiers and students, and for certain equipment.

In 2019, members voted overwhelmingly to convert Egged into a company from a worker cooperative. Had its members voted to not convert its ownership structure, the government could have cancelled an operating agreement it signed with Egged in November 2018, tender out its routes, and imposed various sanctions until it decided to convert into a company.

=== A history of attacks ===
Egged buses and their passengers have been victims of acts of terrorism quite a few times, including:

* Fajja bus attacks - November 30, 1947: An attack on an Egged bus traveling from Netanya to Jerusalem, in which five bus passengers were killed.
* Ma&#x27;ale Akrabim massacre - March 17, 1954: a shooting attack in which 12 passengers of an Egged bus were killed in Akrabbim.
* Coastal Road massacre - March 11, 1978: terrorists took over an Egged bus, and at the end of a struggle between the terrorists and the police, 35 of the bus passengers were killed.
* Tel Aviv–Jerusalem bus 405 suicide attack - July 6, 1989: A terrorist derailed an Egged bus on route 405 into an abyss near Kiryat Ye&#x27;arim. 16 people died.
* Haifa bus 37 suicide bombing - March 5, 2003: a suicide attack by a Hamas terrorist on Moriah Avenue in the Achoza neighborhood in Haifa. 17 people were killed in the attack.
* The Second Intifada: During the Second Intifada, suicide attacks on buses were a major form of terrorism, resulting in hundreds of deaths.
== Bus fleet ==
Egged&#x27;s bus fleet includes a wide variety of bus models of Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, MAN, Golden Dragon, Higer, BYD, and Yutong, many buses build are finished by local Israel bus manufacturers Haargaz and Merkavim.
Historically, the company also extensively used buses by Leyland, Neoplan, Jonckheere, International, Fiat and more.

== International ventures ==
Egged has purchased 51% of the Bulgarian Trans-Triumph bus company, which runs service to cities such as Varna and Sofia, as well as airport and tour buses for approximately €4 million. Egged, through its affiliated company, is responsible for the operation of half the public transportation in the city of Varna, the second-largest city in Bulgaria with about half a million residents. Egged also formed a joint venture company with Rousse municipality called Egged Rousse JSC which operates the public transport in the city of Rousse.

Egged operates some 1,500 buses in Poland, where it owns the Polish bus company Mobilis it acquired for €4 million in 2006. The company operates some metropolitan bus routes, including exclusive franchises in Warsaw, Kraków and Bartoszyce. Mobilis in Warsaw operate 215 buses for public transportation and serves around 40 routes daily. Also, it uses Scania coach for the football team Legia Warszawa and some other buses for special transport and tourism.

Egged Bus Services (EBS) also holds an eight-year contract (with an option for an additional two years) worth about €500 million, for public transport in the region in the Netherlands, starting December 2011. The contract drew opposition from local activist groups who accuse Egged of supporting Israel&#x27;s settlements policy in the West Bank, and consider the company&#x27;s winning the tender as indirect Dutch support for Israel&#x27;s settlements policy, according to reports by Radio Netherlands Worldwide. Egged&#x27;s Dutch subsidiary denies being involved in politics.

== Jerusalem Light Rail ==
In October 2010, Egged bought Veolia Transport&#x27;s share in the Jerusalem Light Rail after a deal with the Dan Bus Company fell through. However, in March 2018 it was revealed that Egged will be prohibited from tendering to operate the light rail over competition concerns.

== Tel Aviv Light Rail ==
Egged has been awarded the tender to operate and maintain the Tel Aviv Red Line from October 2021 by the NTA Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd. tenders committee. The winning bid was from the Tevel consortium controlled by Egged (51%) with Chinese companies Shenzhen Metro (30%) and CCECC (19%). The tender win is subject to approval by the Israel Antitrust Authority.

== &quot;Mehadrin&quot; routes ==

From the late 1990s until January 2011, Egged operated gender-segregated lines, commonly called Mehadrin bus lines mainly running in and/or between major Haredi population centers. In these buses, men sat at the front and women were expected to wear &quot;modest dress.&quot; The &quot;mehadrin&quot; lines were criticized after a woman, Miriam Shear, was allegedly assaulted for refusing to give up her seat to a male passenger and move to the back of the bus. In January 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that forced separation of men and women on buses was illegal but allowed voluntary separation for a one-year experimental period. The court, accepting the recommendations of an investigation committee, ordered the removal of signs designating buses as segregated and the installation of new signs informing passengers of their right to sit wherever they wanted.

The Haredi public has requested to operate private bus lines but they were blocked by the transportation ministry.

== Tourism ==

In later years Egged Bus Cooperative has expanded its services, through its subsidiary company Egged Tours, by offering organized trips abroad for Israelis as well as daily tours in Israel for tourists. Egged Tours is an IATA licensed company which operates as a wholesale company for organized tours all over the world and Israel for groups and individuals. Its services include flights, organized tours, accommodation and trips all year round.

==Criticism==

===Involvement in Israeli settlements===

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the Golan Heights. Egged was listed on the database on account of its activities in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories, which the UN considers to be illegal.

<text>Neurochemistry is the study of chemicals, including neurotransmitters and other molecules such as psychopharmaceuticals and neuropeptides, that control and influence the physiology of the nervous system. This particular field within neuroscience examines how neurochemicals influence the operation of neurons, synapses, and neural networks. Neurochemists analyze the biochemistry and molecular biology of organic compounds in the nervous system, and their roles in such neural processes including cortical plasticity, neurogenesis, and neural differentiation.

==History==
While neurochemistry as a recognized science is relatively new, the idea behind neurochemistry has been around since the 18th century. Originally, the brain had been thought to be a separate entity apart from the peripheral nervous system. Beginning in 1856, there was a string of research that refuted that idea. The chemical makeup of the brain was nearly identical to the makeup of the peripheral nervous system. The first large leap forward in the study of neurochemistry came from Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum, who is one of the pioneers in the field of &quot;brain chemistry.&quot; He was one of the first to hypothesize that many neurological illnesses could be attributed to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. He was also one of the first scientists to believe that through chemical means, the vast majority of neurological diseases could be treated, if not cured.

Irvine Page (1901-1991) was an American psychologist that published the first major textbook focusing on neurochemistry in 1937. He had also established the first department that was solely devoted to the study of neurochemistry in 1928 at the Munich Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry.

Back in the 1930s, neurochemistry was mostly referred to as &quot;brain chemistry&quot; and was mostly devoted to finding different chemical species without directly proposing their specific roles and functions in the nervous system. The first biochemical pathology test for any brain disease can be attributed to Vito Maria Buscaino (1887-1978), a neuropsychiatrist who studied schizophrenia. He found that treating her patients&#x27; urine who had schizophrenia, extrapyramidal disorders, or amentia, with 5% silver nitrate produced a black precipitate linked with an abnormal level of amines. This became known as the &quot;Buscaino Reaction.&quot;

In the 1950s, neurochemistry became a recognized scientific research discipline. The founding of neurochemistry as a discipline traces its origins to a series of &quot;International Neurochemical Symposia&quot;, of which the first symposium volume published in 1954 was titled &quot;Biochemistry of the Developing Nervous System&quot;. These meetings led to the formation of the International Society for Neurochemistry and the American Society for Neurochemistry. These early gatherings discussed the tentative nature of possible neurotransmitter substances such as acetylcholine, histamine, substance P, and serotonin. By 1972, ideas were more concrete.

One of the first major successes in using chemicals to alter brain function was the L-DOPA experiment. In 1961, Walter Burkmayer injected L-DOPA into a patient with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Shortly after injection, the patient had a drastic reduction in tremors, and they were able to control their muscles in ways they hadn&#x27;t been able to in a long time. The effect peaked within 2.5 hours and lasted approximately 24 hours.

== Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides ==
The most important aspect of neurochemistry is the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that comprise the chemical activity in the nervous system. There are many neurochemicals that are integral for proper neural functioning.

The neuropeptide oxytocin, synthesized in magnocellular neurosecretory cells, plays an important role in maternal behavior and sexual reproduction, particularly before and after birth. It is a precursor protein that is processed proteolytically to activate the neuropeptide as its shorter form. It is involved in the letdown reflex when mothers breastfeed, uterine contractions, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis where oxytocin inhibits the release of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone.

Glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter, is an excitatory neurochemical, meaning that its release in the synaptic cleft causes the firing of an action potential. GABA, or Gamma-aminobutyric acid, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It binds to the plasma membrane in the synapses of neurons, triggering the influx of negatively charged chloride ions and the efflux of positively charged potassium ions. This exchange of ions leads to the hyperpolarization of the transmembrane potential of the neuron, which is caused by this negative change.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter with much importance in the limbic system which regulates emotional function regulation. Dopamine has many roles in the brain including cognition, sleep, mood, milk production, movement, motivation, and reward.

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, sleep, and other roles of the brain. It is a peripheral signal mediator and is found in the gastrointestinal tract as well as in blood. Research also suggests that serotonin may play an important role in liver regeneration.

== Signalling ==
Neurochemistry is the study of the different types, structures, and functions of neurons and their chemical components. Chemical signaling between neurons is mediated by neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, hormones, neuromodulators, and many other types of signaling molecules. Many neurological diseases arise due to an imbalance in the brain&#x27;s neurochemistry. For example, in Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, there is an imbalance in the brain&#x27;s level of dopamine. Medications include neurochemicals that are used to alter brain function and treat disorders of the brain. A typical neurochemist might study how the chemical components of the brain interact, neural plasticity, neural development, physical changes in the brain during disease, and changes in the brain during aging.

== Neurochemistry of PTSD ==
One of the major areas of research within neurochemistry is looking at how post-traumatic stress disorder alters the brain. Neurotransmitter level fluctuations can dictate whether a PTSD episode occurs and how long the episode lasts. Dopamine has less of an effect than norepinephrine. Different neurochemicals can affect different parts of the brain. This allows drugs to be used for PTSD to not have an undesired effect on other brain processes. An effective medication to help alleviate nightmares associated with PTSD is Prazosin.

<text>The Maloelap Atoll (Marshallese: , ) (also spelled Maleolap) is a coral atoll of 71 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands. Its land area is only , but that encloses a lagoon of . It is located north of the atoll of Aur. The population of the atoll was 395 at the 2021 census.

The largest of the islands that make up the atoll are Taroa (the administrative center of the atoll), in the northeast, and Kaben in the northwest. Only three of the other islands in the atoll are inhabited: Airuk, Wolot and Jang. The island is served by Air Marshall Islands via Maloelap Airport.

==History==
Maloelap Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan.

In 1939, the Japanese built a seaplane base and landplane Taroa Airfield with two runways (4800&#x27; + 4100&#x27;) and support buildings and facilities, including a radar station. During World War II the Japanese garrison of 2,940 navy men and 389 army men was commanded by Rear Admiral Shoichi Kamada. The perimeter of the island was heavily fortified with 12 heavy coastal artillery and 10 heavy anti-aircraft guns. The island was attacked by the United States Navy beginning in February 1942 starting with carrier-based aircraft and shelling by warships. The attacks grew in frequency and severity after Majuro and Kwajalein had fallen to the Americans. Of the 3097-man Japanese garrison (1772 Imperial Japanese Navy, 368 Imperial Japanese Army, and 957 civilians) only 1041 (34%) survived the war. Several Marshallese were also killed. A large number of war relics, including plane wrecks, mainly Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers remain scattered about.

Following the end of World War II, the island came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. Maloelap Atoll was the first to ratify the Marshall Islands&#x27; constitution.

==Education==

<text>James Brown Ray (February 19, 1794 – August 4, 1848) was an Indiana politician and the only Indiana Senate president pro tempore to be elevated to governor of the state of Indiana. Ray served during a time when the state transitioned from personal politics to political parties, but never joined a party himself. Taking office one week before his 31st birthday, he became the state&#x27;s youngest governor and served from 1825 to 1831, the longest period for an Indiana governor under the state constitution of 1816. During Ray&#x27;s term as governor the state experienced a period of economic prosperity and a 45 percent population increase. He supported projects that encouraged the continued growth and development of the young state, most notably internal improvements, Native American removal, codification of Indiana&#x27;s laws, improved county and local government, and expanded educational opportunities. Ray was known for his eccentricity and early promotion of a large-scale railroad system in the state. His support for new railroad construction and alleged involvement in several scandals caused him to lose popularity among voters. Ray&#x27;s opponents who favored the creation of canals considered railroads to be an impractical, utopian idea. Following Ray&#x27;s departure from political office, he continued to advocate for a statewide railroad system until his death in 1848.

==Early life==

===Family and background===
James Brown Ray was born in Jefferson County, Kentucky, on February 19, 1794, the son of Rev. William Ray, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, and Phebe Ann Brown Ray. He was one of twelve children. Ray attended local common schools and received a basic education. Ray moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when he was still a boy, where he studied law in the office of General Gano, and was admitted to the bar in 1816. Ray briefly served as deputy clerk of Hamilton County, Ohio.

Ray married Mary Riddle of Hamilton County, Ohio, on December 10, 1818. That same year the couple moved to Brookville, Indiana, where they had two children prior to Mary&#x27;s death on July 4, 1823. Ray established a law office in Brookville and quickly rose to prominence in the community. Ray was known to be rash and sometimes belligerent. In one incident Ray insulted a Brookville farmer who severely beat him for the insult. In another incident Ray threatened another lawyer with a &quot;thrashing&quot; before a court session, to which the lawyer replied with a fist in Ray&#x27;s face. The courtroom went wild. Both men had to be restrained before further blows could be thrown.

Ray married Esther Booker (née Gay), widow of Samuel P. Booker, of Centerville, Indiana, in September 1825. The couple had five children.

===Legislator===
Ray&#x27;s outspoken manner helped him gain popularity in his community. In 1821 he served a one-year term in the Indiana House of Representatives. The next year he was elected to the Indiana State Senate and began his term on December 2, 1822. On January 30, 1824, the same day Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon resigned to take a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, Ray was elected the Indiana Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore.

==Governor==
Ray became the state&#x27;s fourth governor on February 12, 1825, when Indiana governor William Hendricks resigned from his office to become a U.S. senator. The lieutenant governor&#x27;s office had remained vacant after Boon&#x27;s departure for the U.S. House of Representatives the previous year. This is the only time this occurred in Indiana history. After a brief debate about his eligibility to become governor because of his young age, Ray was able to provide proof that he met the minimum age of thirty as required under the state constitution.

Indiana was still a young state during Ray&#x27;s tenure as governor, but it was growing rapidly. The state&#x27;s population increased 45 percent and its finances were strengthened during a period of relative prosperity. To encourage further settlement and economic development, Ray supported internal improvements, Native American removal, codification of Indiana&#x27;s laws, improved county and local government, and expanded educational opportunities. Party politics also entered the state during Ray&#x27;s term as governor. Previously, politicians in the state were loosely affiliated with the Democratic-Republican Party or none at all. During the 1820s national parties were generally divided among Jeffersonian Republicans, who followed Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams, and Jacksonian Democrats, who supported Andrew Jackson. Ray resisted the rise of the parties and tried to remain neutral.

In the summer of 1825, Ray announced that he would seek election for a full three-year term as governor. Ray campaigned against Isaac Blackford, Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court. Blackford, a graduate of Princeton University, charged that Ray was &quot;pompous, poorly educated, and ill-equipped for the job.&quot; Ray countered with arguments against party politics and made a strong case for internal improvements. Ray won the election with 13,040 votes to 10,418, a margin of 2,622 votes.

Ray became the first governor to serve in the new capitol of Indianapolis. His wife found the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Monument Circle to lack privacy, and the couple refused to live there.

===Internal improvements===
On December 8, 1825, Ray delivered his first address to the Indiana General Assembly and called for internal improvements in the state&#x27;s transportation system. Ray cited Ohio&#x27;s recent success with its canal projects as evidence of their economic value. However, Ray changed his position in 1827 and decided that the state would receive greater benefit from railroad construction projects. At that time railroads were still relatively new and their value was not yet evident. Ray became an opponent of canal projects and advocated for railroads throughout the remainder of his life. As governor, Ray requested state legislature to create a committee to explore the possibilities of building new railroads. The committed supported the construction of canals. Their report called Ray&#x27;s plans to make Indianapolis a railroad hub &quot;utopian&quot; and &quot;mad and impractical&quot;. A compromise was ultimately reached to fund both projects. After the previous administration&#x27;s efforts under William Hendricks restored the state&#x27;s credit and stabilize its income, Ray&#x27;s administration was able to move ahead with plans to build canals, railroads, and more roads in the state. Design plans for the Wabash and Erie Canal began during Ray&#x27;s administration, but his opponents accused him of purposely delaying progress on the project by delaying reports, slowing progress in surveying, and in other areas, which further kindled distrust from the legislature. The state&#x27;s first railroad was also constructed, a short line connecting Shelbyville, Indiana to Indianapolis as a compromise with the governor to approve funds for the canal. Industry in the state expanded exponentially during those years with several large factories opening up in the different locations around the state.

===Michigan Road===

Another of Ray&#x27;s key transportation projects was the construction of the Michigan Road across Indiana. The plans for the road would extend from the Ohio River in the south to Lake Michigan in the north, and pass through Indianapolis in the central part of the state. The new road would require the Potawatomi and the Miami people to cede their lands in northern and central Indiana to the federal government to make way for its construction. Ray wrote President John Quincy Adams requesting a treaty to acquire land for the project. Adams responded by appointing Ray, Michigan governor Lewis Cass, and John Tipton as commissioners to negotiate a treaty, which was concluded in the fall of 1826. More than of land was transferred to the United States government.

Ray&#x27;s opponents in the state legislature seized the opportunity to attack him for taking a commission from the federal government as a treaty negotiator, claiming that it violated Indiana&#x27;s constitution. His critics argued that in taking the position, Ray forfeited his position as governor. A motion to bring impeachment proceedings against Ray was narrowly defeated in the Indiana General Assembly by a vote of 31 to 27. Ray&#x27;s situation was similar to the attempted impeachment of Indiana governor Jonathan Jennings in 1818.

===Codification of state laws===
Other events began to transpire, which caused Ray&#x27;s popularity to wane considerably. 
Ray initiated efforts to simplify Indiana&#x27;s civil and criminal laws. He suggested that the state&#x27;s legal code should be modeled on Louisiana laws, which used the Napoleonic Code as a template. Ray initially assumed responsibility for the project at his own expense, but two years after the Indiana General Assembly passed a bill to expand and improve the Indiana Code, the work was still not completed. Ray asked the legislature to grant additional funds and provide an assistant to complete the project. The assembly granted his request and appointed a committee to create the Revised Code of 1831.

===Fall Creek Massacre===

Another notable event during Ray&#x27;s first term in office took place when three white men were scheduled to be hanged for the murder of nine Native American men, women, and children. It marked the first documented trial, sentencing, and execution of whites for the murder of Native Americans under United States law. The Fall Creek Massacre and the executions of the convicted murderers took place on Fall Creek, near Pendleton in Madison County, Indiana, ten miles northeast of Indianapolis. On June 3, 1825, a large crowd, including members of the Seneca Nation, gathered to witness the executions. Two of the convicted men were hanged; however, Ray arrived to issue a dramatic, last-minute pardon to seventeen-year-old John Bridge Jr. after local residents petitioned the governor to intervene. Bridge was immediately taken down from the gallows, untied, and set free.

===Education===
Ray supported free public education in Indiana and as governor proposed the sale of public lands to establish schools and hire qualified educators. He recommended that the Indiana State Seminary, which opened in 1825 at Bloomington, Indiana, be elevated to a college. In January 1828 the state legislature approved an act to rename it Indiana College, which later became Indiana University.

===Controversy and political disputes===
In 1827 Ray became involved in a bitter dispute with Samuel Merrill, the Indiana State Treasurer. Merrill, an ally of Blackford, made personal attacks on Ray, claiming he was committing fraud and using his public office for personal gain. Merrill specifically tried to incriminate him for making a secret deal with the Indians when negotiating the treaty in 1826, claiming that he had accepted a bribe from them. Merrill&#x27;s charges were ambiguous, lacking considerable detail, but was enough to stir a controversy and give an excuse to Ray&#x27;s opponents to further again attack. Ray&#x27;s supporters included Lewis Cass, governor of the Michigan Territory, who wrote a letter to the Indiana General Assembly on his behalf. The dispute ended, but Ray&#x27;s image was tarnished.

===Second term===
Political conflicts and controversies continued during Ray&#x27;s second term. When Ray ran for reelection in 1828, he was approached by pro-Jackson men to join the Jacksonian party, which was just beginning to form in the state. Ray agreed to the proposal as long as his acceptance remained a secret. A short time later Ray was interviewed by a pro-Clay newspaper and he called the Jacksonian-Democrats an &quot;outrageous, violent faction.&quot; The Jackson men responded by fielding their own candidate and publishing Ray&#x27;s secret agreement. Despite the controversy over his attempt to gain the favor of both parties, Ray won reelection on August 4, 1828. He received 15,131 votes; Whig candidate Israel T. Branby received 12,251; and Democratic candidate Harbin H. Moore received 10,898.

Another conflict arose in 1830 when the Indiana Supreme Court was up for reappointment. Ray reappointed Justice Issac Blackford, but delayed the reappointment of Jesse Lynch Holman and James Scott. Ray bargained behind the scenes with leaders in the state legislature for a deal: Ray would reappoint Holman and Scott to the courts and in exchange for Ray&#x27;s election to the U. S. Senate. Ray eventually appointed the two men, but lost his bid for the Senate seat. The secret deal, combined with what was considered his &quot;insane&quot; idea of making Indianapolis a hub for a great railroad system and without a party to support him, he lost most of his public support.

Nearing the end of his term in office, Ray became defensive, accused his critics with conspiring against him, and claimed he was the &quot;victim of misrepresentation and malicious envy.&quot; His detractors described him as hot-tempered and unable to handle criticism. Having accomplished little in his second term, Ray left office on December 7, 1831.

==Return to private life==
Ray resumed a law practice in Indianapolis after his term as governor ended, but found the business did not meet his expectations. Ray ran for political office on several occasions but was unsuccessful. In 1831 he ran for Congress, but lost to John Carr. He attempted to run again in 1833, but dropped out after his inability to win became apparent. He tried once again in 1837, but was soundly defeated by William Herod, 5,888 votes to 9,635. Ray also lost bids to become Clerk of Marion County and a commissioner of the Wabash and Erie Canal in 1835. After business ventures in Greencastle failed, Ray moved to Centerville, Indiana, where he established a law firm with a brother and a dry goods business with a nephew. Ray returned to Indianapolis in 1846 to establish a law and advisory business, what he called at &quot;Law, conveyancing, writing, abstract-making, land-agency, general and emigrants&#x27; intelligence and counsel office.&quot; The business soon folded for lack of customers.

Ray purchased a home in Indianapolis that was built in 1835 and originally stood on the site where the Marion County Jail now stands. The home was moved in 1977 and is located within the Lockerbie Square Historic District.Ray&#x27;s home is believed to be one of the oldest remaining in the city.

His treatment led him to become even more firm in his views, which further hurt his standing. His behavior only worsened the situation; he was known to walk with a cane, for appearance only, and stop in the street and write in the air with it for no apparent reason. He ran advertisements in the newspaper offering to sell a &quot;tavern-stand&quot;, a farm he did not own, and offering to construct a railroad from Charleston, South Carolina to Indianapolis. He had few friends and most people believed he had become mentally deranged.

Ray fell ill during a trip to Wisconsin in the summer of 1848 and returned to a relative&#x27;s home in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he died of cholera on August 4, 1848, aged 54. He was buried in Cincinnati&#x27;s Spring Grove Cemetery.

<doc id="542241" wikidata="Q13533436" url="?curid=542241" title="Tetra">
<text>Tetra is the common name of many small freshwater characiform fishes. Tetras come from Africa, Central America, and South America, belonging to the biological family Characidae and to its former subfamilies Alestidae (the &quot;African tetras&quot;) and Lebiasinidae. The Characidae are distinguished from other fish by the presence of a small adipose fin between the dorsal and caudal fins. Many of these, such as the neon tetra (&quot;Paracheirodon innesi&quot;), are brightly colored and easy to keep in captivity. Consequently, they are extremely popular for home aquaria.

&quot;Tetra&quot; is no longer a taxonomic, phylogenetic term. It is short for &quot;Tetragonopterus&quot;, a genus name formerly applied to many of these fish, which is Greek for &quot;square-finned&quot; (literally, four-sided-wing).

Because of the popularity of tetras in the fishkeeping hobby, many unrelated fish are commonly known as tetras, including species from different families. Even vastly different fish may be called tetras. For example, payara (&quot;Hydrolycus scomberoides&quot;) is occasionally known as the &quot;sabretooth tetra&quot; or &quot;vampire tetra&quot;.

Tetras generally have compressed (sometimes deep), bodies and are typically identifiable by their fins. They ordinarily possess a homocercal caudal fin (a twin-lobed, or forked, tail fin whose upper and lower lobes are of equal size) and a tall dorsal fin characterized by a short connection to the fish&#x27;s body. Additionally, tetras possess a long anal fin stretching from a position just posterior of the dorsal fin and ending on the ventral caudal peduncle, and a small, fleshy adipose fin located dorsally between the dorsal and caudal fins. This adipose fin represents the fourth unpaired fin on the fish (the four unpaired fins are the caudal fin, dorsal fin, anal fin, and adipose fin), lending to the name tetra, which is Greek for four. While this adipose fin is generally considered the distinguishing feature, some tetras (such as the emperor tetras, &quot;Nematobrycon palmeri&quot;) lack this appendage. Ichthyologists debate the function of the adipose fin, doubting its role in swimming due to its small size and lack of stiffening rays or spines.

Although the list below is sorted by common name, in a number of cases, the common name is applied to different species. Since the aquarium trade may use a different name for the same species, advanced aquarists tend to use scientific names for the less-common tetras. The list below is incomplete.

<text>The Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art is a museum located on the residential Lighthouse Hill in Egbertville, Staten Island, New York City. It is home to one of the United States&#x27; most extensive collections of Himalayan artifacts. The museum was created by Jacques Marchais, (1887-1948) an American woman, to serve as a bridge between the West and the rich ancient and cultural traditions of Tibet and the Himalayan region. Marchais designed her educational center to be an all-encompassing experience: it was built to resemble a rustic Himalayan monastery with extensive terraced gardens and grounds and a fish and lotus pond. The museum was praised for its authenticity by the Dalai Lama, who visited in 1991. In 2009, the site was listed on the New York State Register and National Register of Historic Places. A writer in the &quot;New York Times&quot; referred to the museum&#x27;s founder under the name Jacqueline Klauber, noting that she used Marchais as her professional name.

Jacques Marchais Coblentz was born in 1887 in Cincinnati, Ohio. After a career as a child actress in Chicago she went to Boston and married at age 16, had three children, and divorced in 1910. After a brief second marriage, she moved to New York City, returned to acting, and associated with people who were interested in Eastern religions and Buddhism. About 1920, she married the owner of a chemical factory, and they lived in the rural Staten Island. There, she began collecting. She opened an art gallery in Manhattan in 1938. In 1945 she opened a research library next to her home in Staten Island.

Marchais had never visited Tibet or the Himalayas, but she had a lifelong interest in the region and sought to find a permanent home for her collection. The museum officially opened in 1947. The museum, its collection and its history in Staten Island have been chronicled in a book by the same name and 60th anniversary exhibition.

The museum has not been able to benefit from the Department of Transportation&#x27;s initiative to draw traffic to the borough&#x27;s cultural organizations via a new signage program because it lacks a dedicated parking lot and as such it remains somewhat hidden among New York City&#x27;s cultural organizations. Bicycling clubs, however, having easier parking, make it a destination.

<doc id="542273" wikidata="Q4973055" url="?curid=542273" title="Brodmann area 11">
<text>Brodmann area 11 is one of Brodmann&#x27;s cytologically defined regions of the brain. It is in the orbitofrontal cortex which is above the eye sockets (orbitae). It is involved in decision making, processing rewards, and encoding new information into long-term memory.

==In humans==
Brodmann area 11, or BA11, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. BA11 is the part of the orbitofrontal cortex that covers the medial portion of the ventral surface of the frontal lobe.

Prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909 is a subdivision of the frontal lobe in the human defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. Defined and illustrated in Brodmann-1909, it included the areas subsequently illustrated in Brodmann-10 as prefrontal area 11 and rostral area 12.

Area 11 is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex of the human. As illustrated in Brodmann-10, It constitutes most of the orbital gyri, gyrus rectus and the most rostral portion of the superior frontal gyrus. It is bounded medially by the inferior rostral sulcus (H) and laterally approximately by the frontomarginal sulcus (H). Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded on the rostral and lateral aspects of the hemisphere by the frontopolar area 10, the orbital area 47, and the triangular area 45; on the medial surface it is bounded dorsally by the rostral area 12 and caudally by the subgenual area 25. In an earlier map, the area labeled 11, i.e., prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909, was larger; it included the area now designated rostral area 12.

==In guenon monkeys==
Brodmann area 11 is a subdivision of the frontal lobe of the guenon monkey defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture (Brodmann-1905). Distinctive features: area 11 lacks an internal granular layer (IV); larger pyramidal cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) merge with a denser self-contained collection of cells in the internal pyramidal layer (V); similar to area 10 of Brodmann-1909 is the presence in the multiform layer (VI) of trains of cells oriented parallel to the cortical surface separated by acellular fiber bundles; a thick molecular layer (I); a relatively narrow overall cortical thickness; and a gradual transition from the multiform layer (VI) to the subcortical white matter.

<doc id="542275" wikidata="Q536115" url="?curid=542275" title="Bajram Rexhepi">
<text>Bajram Rexhepi (3 June 1954 – 21 August 2017), was a Kosovar politician who served as the first elected post-war prime minister and later as interior minister of Kosovo and as a member of the Kosovo Assembly. He was a member of the second largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).

==Early life and education==
Rexhepi was born in Mitrovica, Kosovo on 3 June 1954. He graduated from the University of Prishtina and completed his postgraduate studies at the University of Zagreb in 1985.

==Early career==
Rexhepi spent most of his career working as a surgeon and achieved fame as the best surgeon for circumcisions in the Mitrovica region. During the 1999 Kosovo War, Rexhepi joined the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and spent three months serving as a field doctor. He served as mayor of the Albanian section of Mitrovica, working with United Nations and NATO peacekeepers to implement ideas to diminish the civil unrest.

==Prime minister==

In the general elections of November 2001 in Kosovo, Rexhepi&#x27;s party won 25.7 percent of the votes, second only to Ibrahim Rugova&#x27;s Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), and Rexhepi was appointed prime minister by the Assembly of Kosovo on 4 March 2002.

Bajram Rexhepi was a compromise candidate to lead the broad-coalition government with the support of all parties represented in parliament. LDK declined to support Rexhepi&#x27;s party leader, Hashim Thaçi, as a potential prime minister; other parties declined to enter into a smaller coalition with LDK. Ultimately, parties reached a political agreement whereby Rugova was elected president and Rexhepi appointed the first post-war prime minister.

With key powers reserved for the UN administration, Rexhepi&#x27;s cabinet included nine ministers as follows:

* Ali Sadria (LDK), Economy and Finance
* Ali Jakupi (PDK), Trade and Industry
* Rexhep Osmani (LDK), Education, Science and Technology
* Behxhet Brajshori (LDK), Culture, Youth, Sports and Non-Resident Affairs
* Zef Morina (PShDK), Transport and Communications
* Ahmet Jusufi (AAK), Labor and Social Welfare
* Et&#x27;hem Çeku (AAK), Spatial Planning
* Jakup Krasniqi (PDK), Public Services
* Numan Balić (SDA), Health

In the following general elections, held on 24 October 2004, the Democratic Party of Kosovo came second and won 30 seats in the parliament.

==Minister of Interior==
On 1 April 2010, Rexhepi was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, replacing Zenun Pajaziti. On 22 February 2011 the Assembly confirmed Rexhepi in his post within the new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi

==Post-politics, illness, and death==
Rexhepi left politics in 2014 to resume his career as a surgeon. In April 2017, Rexhepi suffered multiple strokes, which left him in a coma. After several days of treatment in Kosovo, Rexhepi was sent for further treatment in Turkey. On 21 August 2017, Rexhepi died at a hospital in Istanbul at the age of 63.

<text>Ailinglaplap or Ailinglapalap (Marshallese: , ) is a coral atoll of 56 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ralik Chain in the Marshall Islands. It is located northwest of Jaluit Atoll. Its total land area is only , but it encloses a lagoon of . The economy of the atoll is dominated by coconut plantations. The population of the atoll was 1,175 in 2021. Jabat Island is located off the coast of Ailinglaplap Atoll. The former president of the Marshall Islands, Kessai Note, was born on Jeh Island, Ailinglaplap Atoll.

&quot;Ailinglaplap&quot; translates as &quot;greatest atoll&quot; (&#x27; (atoll) +&#x27; (superlative suffix)), because the greatest legends of the Marshallese people were created there. The four major population centers on Ailinglaplap Atoll are the settlements of Wotja, at the westernmost end of the atoll, Jih in the northeast, and Airek and Bigatjelang in the south.

==History==
Captain Thomas Dennet of the British vessel &quot;Britannia&quot; sighted the atoll in 1797 on route from Australia to China and named it Lambert Island.
The British merchant vessel &quot;Rolla&quot; sighted several islands in the Ratak and Ralik Chains. On 6 November 1803 she sighted islands at , which was possibly Ailinglaplap Atoll. The next day six canoes of friendly natives came off. &quot;Rolla&quot; had transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales and was on her way to Canton to find a cargo to take back to Britain.

In 1885, the German Empire claimed Ailinglaplap Atoll along with the rest of the Marshall Islands. A number of European trading stations were established on the islands to Ailingkaplap as part of the copra trade. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. The base became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

There are currently 4 Iroijlaplap (or paramount chief) of Ailinglaplap.

==Infrastructure==
There are 3 airstrips on the atoll, which are served by Air Marshall Islands when its aircraft are operational:
* Ailinglaplap Airok Airport is located to the south: .
* Jeh Airport is located to the northeast: .
* Woja Airport is located to west: .

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates public schools:
* Aerok Ailinglaplap
* Buoj Elementary School
* Enewa Elementary School
* Jah Elementary School
* Jeh Elementary School
* Jobwon Elementary School
* Katiej Elementary School
* Mejel Elementary School
* Woja Elementary School

Students are zoned to Jaluit High School in Jaluit Atoll.

In the 1994–1995 school year Ailinglaplap had one private high school.

<doc id="542283" wikidata="Q432322" url="?curid=542283" title="Ivy Compton-Burnett">
<text>Dame Ivy Compton-Burnett, (; 5 June 188427 August 1969) was an English novelist, published in the original editions as I. Compton-Burnett. She was awarded the 1955 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for her novel &quot;Mother and Son&quot;. Her works consist mainly of dialogue and focus on family life among the late Victorian or Edwardian upper middle class.

==Background==
===Parentage===
Ivy Compton-Burnett was born in Pinner, Middlesex, on 5 June 1884, as the seventh of twelve children of a well-known homeopathic physician and prolific medical author, Dr James Compton-Burnett (the names were hyphenated and pronounced &#x27;Cumpton-Burnit&#x27;, 1840–1901) by his second wife, Katharine (1855–1911), daughter of civil engineer, surveyor and architect (&quot;many of the best houses built [in Dover] between 1850 and 1860 were his&quot;) Rowland Rees, who was also Mayor of Dover.

===The Compton-Burnett family===
Given the subjects of most of her works, it was widely assumed that the Compton-Burnett family were landed gentry; in his review of the final volume of Hilary Spurling&#x27;s biography, J. I. M. Stewart wrote: &quot;this persuasion she did nothing to controvert... when her ardent admirer and close friend Robert Liddell engaged in a somewhat demeaning rummage in Burke and Crockford in search of distinguished Compton-Burnetts whether living or dead and gone, he was astonished to discover none at all. Both Burnetts and Comptons had in fact been farm labourers not many generations back, and Mrs Spurling thinks that Ivy must have been about thirty before seeing the inside of an English country house.&quot; According to Spurling, &quot;Ivy&#x27;s... friends in later life generally assumed that she came, as the families do in her books, of a long line of country squires.&quot; In fact &quot;she had moved with her family four times before she was 14, living on housing estates or in brand new suburban developments, hearing practically nothing about her Compton Burnett relations.&quot;

The Compton-Burnett family in fact descended from small tenant farmers of Gavelacre Farm, near Winchester, Hampshire (who despite owning no land called themselves &quot;yeomen&quot;), who pretended since the time of Ivy&#x27;s grandfather Charles to be descended from the younger branch of the landowning Scottish Burnett (also Burnet) family through Alexander Burnett, 12th Laird of Leys, his son, judge Robert Burnet, Lord Crimond, and his grandson Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury from 1689 to 1715. This claim &quot;was unquestioningly accepted by Charles&#x27;s descendants, and the whole affair passed... rapidly into family legend.&quot; This claim is repeated in Elizabeth Sprigge&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Ivy Compton-Burnett&quot;; it was the later biography by Hilary Spurling (in which she notes the &quot;many misleading claims... made for I. Compton-Burnett&#x27;s family tree&quot;) that meticulously traces the family. J. Bhagyalakshmi, in &quot;Ivy Compton-Burnett and her Art&quot; (1986) reflects that the former was &quot;a friend&#x27;s memoir&quot;, as opposed to Spurling having taken &quot;pains of a scholar&quot; in compiling her biography. James Compton-Burnett&#x27;s father, Charles, was an itinerant farm labourer – among other places at Redlynch, near Salisbury, where his son was born – who later settled at French Street, in a poor area of Southampton, and went into business as a corn and coal dealer, later living at Millbrook, outside Southampton, and working as a dairyman. Before Spurling&#x27;s research, it had been claimed that he was &quot;a considerable landowner&quot; at Redlynch, but the Compton-Burnetts of Charles&#x27;s generation were in fact working-class labourers and grocers, and despite their claims over several generations of yeoman status, the Compton-Burnett family never owned any land. The &quot;Compton&quot; name had been used since the 1803 marriage of James Compton-Burnett&#x27;s grandfather, Richard Burnett, to a Catherine Maria Compton, of Hampshire, allegedly in honour of her &quot;large fortune&quot;; in fact, she was daughter of a blacksmith, who loaned his son-in-law £300. Richard&#x27;s younger brother William would marry Catherine&#x27;s sister, Anne; many of the children of both marriages bore the name &quot;Compton&quot;. Ivy Compton-Burnett&#x27;s first cousin was Margery Blackie, a homeopathic physician. 
===Upbringing and education===
Ivy grew up in Hove and London. She was educated at home with two brothers until the age of 14. She attended Addiscombe College, Hove, in 1898–1901, then boarded for two terms in 1901–1902 at Howard College, Bedford, before embarking on a university degree in Classics at Royal Holloway College, University of London. After graduating she in turn tutored four younger sisters at home. Ivy&#x27;s mother sent all her stepchildren away to boarding-school as soon as possible. According to the scholar Patrick Lyons, &quot;In widowhood Compton-Burnett&#x27;s mother provided her with an early model for the line of outrageous domestic bullies that appear in her novels, anticipating the grief-stricken and over-demanding Sophia Stace (&quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, 1929) and the more shamelessly lucid Harriet Haslem (&quot;Men and Wives&quot;, 1931), who declares candidly: &quot;I see my children&#x27;s faces, and am urged by the hurt in them to go further, and driven on to the worse.&quot; Four of Ivy&#x27;s sisters rebelled against home life in 1915 and moved up to London to live in a flat with the pianist Myra Hess. Ivy successfully managed the family trust, consisting of both parents&#x27; estates and largely taking the form of tenanted property, after her mother&#x27;s death.

In the author blurb of the early Penguin editions of her novels there was a paragraph written by Compton-Burnett herself: &quot;I have had such an uneventful life that there is little information to give. I was educated with my brothers in the country as a child, and later went to Holloway College, and took a degree in Classics. I lived with my family when I was quite young but for most of my life have had my own flat in London. I see a good deal of a good many friends, not all of them writing people. And there is really no more to say.&quot; This omits the facts that her favourite brother, Guy, died of pneumonia; another, Noel, was killed on the Somme, and her two youngest sisters, Stephanie Primrose and Catharine (called &quot;Baby&quot; and &quot;Topsy&quot;), died in a suicide pact by taking veronal in their locked bedroom on Christmas Day, 1917. Not one of the twelve siblings had children, and all eight girls remained unmarried.

==Companion==
Compton-Burnett spent much of her life as a companion to Margaret Jourdain (1876–1951), a leading authority and writer on the decorative arts and the history of furniture, who shared the author&#x27;s Kensington flat from 1919. For the first ten years, Compton-Burnett seems to have remained unobtrusively in the background, always severely dressed in black. When &quot;Pastors and Masters&quot; appeared in 1925, Jourdain said she had been unaware that her friend was writing a novel.

After Jourdain&#x27;s death in 1951 Compton-Burnett was likely in a relationship with Madge Garland, former British &quot;Vogue&quot; editor and founder of the School of Fashion at the Royal College of Art. Garland described this as &quot;one of the happiest things in a long and troubled life&quot; and Compton-Burnett was &quot;besotted with Madge&quot;. They took trips and holidays together until Compton-Burnett&#x27;s death. Garland is considered to have been a lesbian by her biographer Lisa Cohen, though her private life was often veiled due to her position in society.

==Honours==
Compton-Burnett was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1967.

==Death==
Ivy Compton-Burnett held no religious beliefs; she was a &quot;fierce Victorian atheist&quot;. She died at her Kensington home on 27 August 1969 and was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium.

==Work==
Apart from &quot;Dolores&quot; (1911), a traditional novel she later rejected as something &quot;one wrote as a girl&quot;, Compton-Burnett&#x27;s fiction deals with domestic situations in large households which, to all intents and purposes, invariably seem Edwardian. The description of human weaknesses and foibles of all sorts pervades her work, and the family that emerges from each of her novels must be seen as dysfunctional in one way or another, with parents struggling with children, or sibling rivalries producing malicious, if covert, power struggles.

Starting with &quot;Pastors and Masters&quot; (1925), Compton-Burnett developed a highly individualistic style. Her fiction relies heavily on formal dialogue (in strong contrast to the often melodramatic plots), and demands constant attention on the reader&#x27;s part: there are instances in her work where important information is casually mentioned in a half sentence, and her use of punctuation is deliberately perfunctory. The result is to create a deliberately claustrophobic fictional world, dominated by the psychological exploration of small-scale power-abuse and persecution.

==Critical reception==
There has been longstanding appreciation of Compton-Burnett&#x27;s novels. Of &quot;Pastors and Masters&quot; the &quot;New Statesman&quot; wrote: &quot;It is astonishing, amazing. It is like nothing else in the world. It is a work of genius.&quot; In her essay collection &quot;L&#x27;Ère du soupçon&quot; (1956), an early manifesto for the French &quot;nouveau roman&quot;, Nathalie Sarraute hails Compton-Burnett as &quot;one of the greatest novelists England has ever had.&quot;

Elizabeth Bowen said of the wartime &quot;Parents and Children&quot;, &quot;To read in these days a page of Compton-Burnett dialogue is to think of the sound of glass being swept up, one of these London mornings after a blitz.&quot; Patrick Lyons wrote over 30 years later, &quot;These are witty and often demanding novels, peopled with alert sceptics who are devoted to epigrammatic talk and edgily precise analysis of talk.&quot;

Susan Sontag listed the novels of Compton-Burnett as examples of &quot;camp&quot; in her essay, Notes on &quot;Camp&quot; in 1964.

==Bibliography==
*Published in the United States as &quot;Bullivant and the Lambs&quot;.
There has been a recovery of UK and US interest in Compton-Burnett&#x27;s novels in the 2000s. There were several translations into French, Italian, Spanish and other languages.

<text>Bellville is a large town in the Western Cape, South Africa, and is part of the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town. Having formerly been an independent city, it was later incorporated into the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality, which is located in the Western Cape province of South Africa. 

The town is an industrial and commercial node, a university town, and a major transportation hub within the greater Cape Town metropolitan area. 

The residential suburb of Bellville lies approximately 23 kilometres (14.3 mi) north-east of Cape Town and 38 kilometres (23.6 mi) south-west of Paarl set amongst the Tygerberg Hills with views over the Cape Fold Mountains. Vehicle registrations in Bellville start with CY which also covers the Tygerberg areas of Durbanville, Parow and Goodwood.

== Established ==
It was founded as &quot;12 Mile Post&quot; (Afrikaans: &quot;12-Myl-Pos&quot;) because it is located 12 miles (20 km) from Cape Town city centre. It was first known as &quot;Hardekraaltjie&quot;. Founded as a railway station on the line from Cape Town to Stellenbosch and Strand, it was renamed Bellville in 1861 after the surveyor-general Charles Bell. 

== Hospitals and educational institutes ==
The Karl Bremer Hospital functioned as the Academic Hospital for the University of Stellenbosch Medical School, but now the adjacent Tygerberg Hospital houses the medical school. Other hospitals in Bellville are: Mediclinic International Louis Leipoldt and Melomed. The Cape Peninsula University of Technology, University of the Western Cape, University of Stellenbosch Business School and Northlink College are also situated in Bellville. D.F. Malan High School, Bellville High School, Westcliff School of Skills, The Settlers High School and Stellenberg High School are located in the area.

== Economy ==
=== Major companies ===
Bellville is one of the main business nodes in the Greater Cape Town metropolitan area, home to the headquarters of major corporations such as insurance giant, Sanlam and its subsidiary Santam, Metropolitan, Pioneer Foods, Cipla South Africa, Medi-Rite, Footgear, Afrimat and the Bible Society of South, with most of these companies headquartered in the Tyger Valley commercial node. 

Many provincial and local government departments maintain regional branches or other offices in Bellville such as Eskom, Department of Water and Sanitation (Western Cape), Water and Sanitation Department (City of Cape Town) and Electricity Services (City of Cape Town).

== Geography ==
Bellville forms the centre of the Northern Suburbs, and is situated between the low-lying Cape Flats to the south and the rolling hills of Tygerberg to the north. It lies at an average altitude of about 80 m (262 ft) above sea level, with the altitude gradually rising towards the north where the suburb of Welgemoed on the slopes of the Tygerberg Hill lies at the highest altitude of 310 m (1017 ft). The town borders Durbanville to the north, Parow to the west, Brackenfell to the east, Kuilsrivier to the southeast and Belhar to the south.

=== Suburbs ===
The central business district of Bellville, also known as Bellville Central, situated along Voortrekker Road, is the traditional commercial hub of the town and contains several high-rise buildings and structures, with the Telkom communications tower dominating the skyline. The suburbs north of the N1 highway include the most wealthy and developed parts of the town, spreading north to the border with Durbanville and up the Tygerberg Hill which overlooks the Cape Town metropolitan area. The suburbs south of the CBD tend to be either solely industrial or solely residential and are included in one of Bellville’s lowest income brackets. The suburbs east and west of Bellville tend to be mostly quiet and established residential areas, with the exception of Stikland, an industrial area situated in the far east of Bellville.

==Coat of arms==
The municipal council assumed a coat of arms on 18 June 1947. It later altered the arms, three times, before settling on the final version in 1979.
The shield was divided into twelve horizontal bars of red and gold, representing the original village name of &quot;Twaalfmyl&quot;. A black vertical band (&quot;pale&quot;) down the centre displayed two silver hawk&#x27;s bells, between which was a small blue shield displaying a golden sheaf of wheat. The crest was a black eagle, and the motto &quot;Prendre sa belle&quot;. Some time later, the blue shield was removed, and the wheatsheaf was placed directly on the black pale. In 1957, the wheatsheaf was replaced with a third hawk&#x27;s bell. This version of the arms, re-drawn by Ivan Mitford-Barberton, was registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in February 1959.

The final version of the arms, as amended by Cornelis Pama in 1979, replaced the hawk&#x27;s bells with church bells. In this form, the arms were registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in February 1980. The registered blazon was : &quot;Barry of twelve Gules and Or, on a pale Sable three church bells Argent.&quot;

<text>A neurochemical is a small organic molecule or peptide that participates in neural activity. The science of neurochemistry studies the functions of neurochemicals.

==Prominent neurochemicals==
===Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators===
*Glutamate is the most common neurotransmitter. Most neurons secrete with glutamate or GABA. Glutamate is excitatory, meaning that the release of glutamate by one cell usually causes adjacent cells to fire an action potential. (Note: Glutamate is chemically identical to the MSG commonly used to flavor food.)
*GABA is an example of an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
* Monoamine neurotransmitters:
**Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter. It plays a key role in the functioning of the limbic system, which is involved in emotional function and control. It also is involved in cognitive processes associated with movement, arousal, executive function, body temperature regulation, and pleasure and reward, and other processes.
**Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is involved in arousal, pain perception, executive function, body temperature regulation, and other processes.
**Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a monoamine neurotransmitter that plays in fight-or-flight response, increases blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and glucose.
**Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter that plays a regulatory role in mood, sleep, appetite, body temperature regulation, and other processes.
**Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is involved in arousal, pain, body temperature regulation, and appetite.
* Trace amines act as neuromodulators in monoamine neurons via binding to TAAR1. 
*Acetylcholine assists motor function and is involved in memory.
*Nitric oxide functions as a neurotransmitter, despite being a gas. It is not grouped with the other neurotransmitters because it is not released in the same way.
*Endocannabinoids act in the endocannabinoid system to control neurotransmitter release in a host of neuronal tissues, including the hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.
* Eicosanoids act as neuromodulators via the &quot;Arachidonic acid cascade.&quot;

===Neuropeptides===
*Orexins (-A and -B) are involved in a number of cognitive processes, including appetite, arousal, and reward, among many others.
*Neurohypophysial hormones:
**Arginine-vasopressin
**Oxytocin regulates social cognition (e.g., trust and pair-bonding) and modulates maternal behavior.
*Endogenous opioids:
**Dynorphins
**Endorphins
**Endomorphins
**Enkephalins
* Neurotrophic factors are biomolecules – nearly all of which are peptides or small proteins – that support the growth, survival, and differentiation of both developing and mature neurons. Examples of notable neurotrophic factors include:
** Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
** Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
** Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
** Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
** Nerve growth factor
** Neurotrophin-3
** Neurotrophin-4
** Ephrins
** Neuregulins

<text>Arno Atoll (, ) is a coral atoll of 133 islands in the Pacific Ocean, and forms a legislative district of the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands. Its total land area is only . Unlike most other atolls, Arno encloses three different lagoons, a large central one, and two smaller ones in the north and east. Its main lagoon encloses an area of . At a distance of only , it is the closest atoll to the Marshall Islands capital, Majuro Atoll, and can be seen looking east from Majuro on a clear day at low tide. The population of Arno Atoll was 1,141 at the 2021 census. The most populous islets are Ajeltokrok, Kobjeltak, Rearlaplap, Langor and Tutu. The largest village is Ine, Arno.

People of Arno are well known for their productivity in making copra (the dried out meat of coconuts, from which coconut oil is extracted). Arno women are renowned for their production of the Kili Bag, a popular handwoven handbag/purse, named after another island in the Marshall Islands (to which the people of Bikini were eventually relocated as a result of the US nuclear tests that were conducted on their home atoll). Arno supposedly had a traditional &quot;love school&quot;.
==History==
Arno Atoll was claimed by the German Empire along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1885. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, Arno Atoll came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The island has been part of the independent Republic of the Marshall Islands since 1986.

<doc id="542300" wikidata="Q178084" url="?curid=542300" title="Ilkhanate">
<text>The Ilkhanate or Il-khanate was a Mongol khanate founded in the southwestern territories of the Mongol Empire. It was ruled by the Il-Khans or Ilkhanids (), and known to the Mongols as Hülegü Ulus (). The Ilkhanid realm was officially known as the Land of Iran or simply Iran. It was established after Hülegü, the son of Tolui and grandson of Genghis Khan, inherited the West Asian and Central Asian part of the Mongol Empire after his brother Möngke Khan died in 1259.

The Ilkhanate&#x27;s core territory was situated in what is now the countries of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. At its greatest extent, the Ilkhanate also included parts of modern Iraq, Syria, Armenia, Georgia, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, part of modern Dagestan, and part of modern Tajikistan. Later Ilkhanid rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, converted to Islam. In the 1330s, the Ilkhanate was ravaged by the Black Death. The last ilkhan, Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan, died in 1335, after which the Ilkhanate disintegrated.

The State of the Ilkhanate was known as the Ulus of Hülegü to the Mongols during that time, as their territory was derived from one of uluses allocated to Genghis (Chinggis) Khan&#x27;s descendants. The Ilkhanid rulers, although of non-Iranian origin, tried to advertise their authority by tying themselves to the Iranian past, and they recruited historians to present the Mongols as heirs to the Sasanian Empire (224–651). Native intellectuals interested in their own history interpreted the unification by the Mongols as a revival of their long-lost dynastic tradition, and the concept of &quot;Land of Iran&quot; (&quot;Irān-zamin&quot;) was considered an important ideology and was further developed by the later Safavid Empire (1501–1736). Similar to the development in China under the Yuan dynasty, the revival of the concept of territorial unity, although not intended by the Mongols, became a lasting legacy of Mongol rule in Iran.

==History==
===Origin===
When Muhammad II of Khwarazm ordered a contingent of merchants, dispatched by the Mongols, to be killed, Genghis Khan declared war on the Anushtegin dynasty in 1219. The Mongols overran the empire, occupying the major cities and population centers between 1219 and 1221. Iran was ravaged by the Mongol detachment under Jebe and Subutai, who left the area in ruin. Transoxiana also came under Mongol control after the invasion.

Muhammad II&#x27;s son Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu returned to Iran in c. 1224 after fleeing to India. The rival Turkic states, which were all that remained of his father&#x27;s empire, quickly declared their allegiance to Jalal. He repulsed the first Mongol attempt to take Central Persia. However, Jalal ad-Din was overwhelmed and crushed by Chormaqan&#x27;s army sent by the Great Khan Ögedei in 1231. During the Mongol expedition, Azerbaijan and the southern Persian dynasties in Fars and Kerman voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute.

To the west, Hamadan and the rest of Persia was secured by Chormaqan. The Mongols invaded Armenia and Georgia in 1234 or 1236, completing the conquest of the Kingdom of Georgia in 1238. They began to attack the western parts of Bagratid Armenia, which was under the Seljuks, the following year. By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia (including modern-day Azerbaijan), Armenia, Georgia (excluding Abbasid Iraq and Ismaili strongholds), as well as all of Afghanistan and Kashmir. After the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, the Mongols under Baiju occupied Anatolia, while the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm and the Empire of Trebizond became vassals of the Mongols.

In 1236 Ögedei commanded Greater Khorasan to be restored and the city of Herat repopulated. The Mongol military governors mostly made camp in the Mughan plain in what is now Azerbaijan. Realizing the danger posed by the Mongols, the rulers of Mosul and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia submitted to the Great Khan. Chormaqan divided Transcaucasia into three districts based on the Mongol military hierarchy. In Georgia, the population was temporarily divided into eight tumens. In 1244, Güyük Khan stopped raising of revenue from districts in Persia as well and offered tax exemptions to others. In accordance with a complaint by the governor Arghun Aqa, Möngke Khan prohibited &quot;ortogh&quot;-merchants (Mongol-contracted Muslim traders) and nobles from abusing relay stations and civilians in 1251. He ordered a new census and decreed that each man in the Mongol-ruled West Asia must pay in proportion to his property. Persia was divided between four districts under Arghun. Möngke Khan granted the Kartids authority over Herat, Jam, Pushang (Fushanj), Ghor, Khaysar, Firuz-Kuh, Gharjistan, Farah, Sistan, Kabul, Tirah, and Afghanistan.

===Hulegu Khan===

Hulegu Khan, third son of Tolui, grandson of Genghis Khan, and brother of both Möngke Khan and Kublai Khan, was the first khan of the Ilkhanate. Immediately after his brother Möngke&#x27;s accession as Great Khan in 1251, Hulagu was appointed as administrator of North China, however in the following year, North China was assigned to Kublai and Hulagu tasked with conquering the Abbasid Caliphate. He was given a fifth of the entire Mongol army for the campaign and he took his sons Abaqa and Yoshmut along with him. Hulagu also took with him many Chinese scholars and astronomers, from whom the famous Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi learned about the mode of the Chinese calculating tables. An observatory was built on a hill of Maragheh. Taking over from Baiju in 1255, Hulagu established Mongol rule from Transoxiana to Syria. He destroyed the Nizari Ismaili state and the Abbasid Caliphate in 1256 and 1258 respectively. In 1258, Hulagu proclaimed himself ilkhan (subordinate khan). After that he advanced as far as Gaza, briefly conquering Ayyubid Syria and Aleppo in 1260. Möngke&#x27;s death forced Hulagu to return to Mongolia to attend the kuriltai for the next Great Khan. He left a small force of around 10,000 behind in Palestine that was defeated at the Battle of Ain Jalut by the Mamluks of Egypt.

Due to the suspicious deaths of three Jochid princes in Hulagu&#x27;s service, Berke of the Golden Horde declared war on Hulagu in 1262. According to Mamluk historians, Hulagu might have massacred Berke&#x27;s troops and refused to share his war booty with Berke. Berke sought a joint attack with Baybars and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde dispatched the young prince Nogai to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The Ilkhanid army then crossed the Terek River, capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only to be routed in a surprise attack by Nogai&#x27;s forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen Terek River.

In 1262, Hulagu gave Greater Khorasan and Mazandaran to Abaqa and northern Azerbaijan to Yoshmut. Hulagu himself spent his time living as a nomad in southern Azerbaijan and Armenia. During his early rule, the Ilkhanate experienced mass revolts by its subjects, with the exception of the Seljukids and Artuqids in Anatolia and Mardin. It was not until Shams al-Din Juvayni was appointed as vizier after 1262 that things started calming down and a more sustainable administration was implemented.

Hulagu fell ill in February 1265 after several days of banquets and hunting. He died on 8 February and his son Abaqa succeeded him in the summer.

===Middle period (1265–1291)===

Upon Abaqa&#x27;s accession, he immediately faced an invasion by Berke of the Golden Horde, which ended with Berke&#x27;s death in Tiflis. In 1270, Abaqa defeated an invasion by Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq of the Chagatai Khanate. Abaqa&#x27;s brother Tekuder sacked Bukhara in retaliation. In 1277, the Mamluks invaded Anatolia and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Elbistan. Stung by the defeat, Abaqa executed the local regent Mu&#x27;in al-Din Parwana and replaced him with the Mongol prince Qongqortai. In 1281, Abaqa sent Mongke Temur against the Mamluks, but he too was defeated at Homs.

Abaqa&#x27;s death in 1282 triggered a succession struggle between his son Arghun, supported by the Qara&#x27;unas, and his brother Tekuder, supported by the Chinggisid aristocracy. Tekuder was elected khan by the Chinggisids. Tekuder was the first Muslim ruler of the Ilkhanate but he made no active attempt to proselytize or convert his realm. However he did try to replace Mongol political traditions with Islamic ones, resulting in a loss of support from the army. Arghun used his religion against him by appealing to non-Muslims for support. When Tekuder realized this, he executed several of Arghun&#x27;s supporters, and captured Arghun. Tekuder&#x27;s foster son, Buaq, freed Arghun and overthrew Tekuder. Arghun was confirmed as ilkhan by Kublai Khan in February 1286.

During Arghun&#x27;s reign, he actively sought to combat Muslim influence, and fought against both the Mamluks and the Muslim Mongol emir Nawruz in Khorasan. To fund his campaigns, Arghun allowed his viziers Buqa and Sa&#x27;d-ud-dawla to centralize expenditures, but this was highly unpopular and caused his former supporters to turn against him. Both viziers were killed and Arghun was murdered in 1291.

===Religious shift (1291–1316)===

The Ilkhanate started crumbling under the reign of Arghun&#x27;s brother, Gaykhatu. The majority of Mongols converted to Islam while the Mongol court remained Buddhist. Gaykhatu had to buy the support of his followers and as a result, ruined the realm&#x27;s finances. His vizir Sadr-ud-Din Zanjani tried to bolster the state finances by adopting paper money from the Yuan dynasty, which remained largely unsuccessful. Gaykhatu also alienated the Mongol old guard with his alleged sexual relations with a boy. Gaykhatu was overthrown in 1295 and replaced with his cousin Baydu. Baydu reigned for less than a year before he was overthrown by Gaykhatu&#x27;s officer, Ghazan.

Hulagu&#x27;s descendants ruled Persia for the next eighty years, tolerating multiple religions, including Shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity, and ultimately adopting Islam as a state religion in 1295. However, despite this conversion, the Ilkhanids remained opposed to the Mamluks, who had defeated both Mongol invaders and Crusaders. The Ilkhanids launched several invasions of Syria, but were never able to gain and keep significant ground against the Mamluks, eventually being forced to give up their plans to conquer Syria, along with their stranglehold over their vassals the Sultanate of Rum and the Armenian kingdom in Cilicia. This was in large part due to civil war in the Mongol Empire and the hostility of the khanates to the north and east. The Chagatai Khanate in Moghulistan and the Golden Horde threatened the Ilkhanate in the Caucasus and Transoxiana, preventing expansion westward. Even under Hulagu&#x27;s reign, the Ilkhanate was engaged in open warfare in the Caucasus with the Mongols in the Russian steppes. On the other hand, the China-based Yuan dynasty was an ally of the Ikhanate and also held nominal suzerainty over the latter (the Emperor being also Great Khan) for many decades.

Ghazan converted to Islam under influence of Nawrūz and made Islam the official state religion. Christian and Jewish subjects lost their equal status and had to pay the jizya (minority religion tax). Ghazan gave Buddhists the starker choice of conversion or expulsion and ordered their temples to be destroyed; though he later relaxed this severity. After Nawrūz was deposed and killed in 1297, Ghazan made religious intolerance punishable and attempted to restore relations with non-Muslims.

In terms of foreign relations, the Ilkhanids&#x27; conversion to Islam had little to no effect on its hostility towards other Muslim states, and conflict with the Mamluks for control of Syria continued. The Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar, the only major victory by the Mongols over the Mamluk Sultanate, ended the latter&#x27;s control over Syria for a few months.

For the most part, Ghazan&#x27;s policies continued under his brother Öljaitü despite suggestions that he might begin to favor Twelver Shi&#x27;ism after he came under the influence of the theologians al-Allama al-Hilli and al-Bahrani.

Öljeitü, who had been baptised in Christianity as an infant and had flirted with Buddhism, eventually became a Hanafi Sunni, though he still retained some residual shamanism. In 1309–10, he became a Shi&#x27;ite Muslim. An Armenian scribe in 1304 noted the death of &quot;benevolent and just&quot; Ghazan, who was succeeded by Khar-Banda Öljeitü, &quot;who too, exhibits good will to everyone.&quot; A colophon from 1306 reports the conversion of Mongols to Islam and &quot;they coerce everyone into converting to their vain and false hope. They persecute, they molest, and torment,&quot; including &quot;insulting the cross and the church&quot;. Some of the Buddhists who survived Ghazan&#x27;s assaults made an unsuccessful attempt to bring Öljeitü back into Buddhism, showing they were active in the realm for more than 50 years.

The conversion of Mongols was initially a fairly superficial affair. The process of establishment of Islam did not happen suddenly. Öljeitü&#x27;s historian Qāshāni records that Kutlushah, after losing patience with a dispute between Hanafi and Shafi&#x27;i Sunnis, expressed his view that Islam should be abandoned and Mongols should return to the ways of Genghis Khan. Qāshani also stated that Öljeitü had reverted for a brief period. As Muslims, Mongols showed a marked preference for Sufism, with masters like Safi-ad-Din Ardabili often treated with respect and favour.

===Disintegration (1316–1357)===
Öljaitü&#x27;s son, the last ilkhan, Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan, was enthroned in 1316. He was faced with rebellion in 1318 by the Chagatayids and Qara&#x27;unas in Khorasan, and an invasion by the Golden Horde at the same time. An Anatolian emir, Irenchin, also rebelled. Irenchin was crushed by Chupan of the Taichiud in the Battle of Zanjan-Rud on 13 July 1319. Under the influence of Chupan, the Ilkhanate made peace with the Chagatais, who helped them crush the Chagatayid revolt, and the Mamluks. In 1327, Abu-Sai&#x27;d replaced Chupan with &quot;Big&quot; Hasan. Hasan was accused of attempting to assassinate the khan and exiled to Anatolia in 1332. The non-Mongol emirs Sharaf-ud-Din Mahmud-Shah and Ghiyas-ud-Din Muhammad were given unprecedented military authority, which irked the Mongol emirs. In the 1330s, outbreaks of the Black Death ravaged the Ilkhanate and both Abu-Sai&#x27;d and his sons were killed by 1335 by the plague. Ghiyas-ud-Din put a descendant of Ariq Böke, Arpa Ke&#x27;un, on the throne, triggering a succession of short-lived khans until &quot;Little&quot; Hasan took Azerbaijan in 1338. In 1357, Jani Beg of the Golden Horde conquered Chupanid-held Tabriz for a year, putting an end to the Ilkhanate remnant.

==The title Ilkhan==
According to the historian Rashid al-Din Hamadani, Kublai Khan granted Hülegü the title Ilkhan after he became the sole Qaghan (Great Khan) of the Mongols, by assigning the governorship of &quot;the lands of the Tajiks [Arabs and Persians] from the banks of the Oxus to the river of Egypt&quot; to Hülegü. Qubilai evidently sent 30,000 Mongol soldiers to reinforce Hülegü&#x27;s authority in Iran. The term &quot;Ilkhan&quot; is a combination of two words: (1) Il (or El), which means &quot;people&quot; in Turkic and &quot;the whole people&quot; or &quot;that particular&quot; in Mongolian and (2) the khan which means &#x27;king&#x27; or &#x27;sovereign&#x27;. This title refers to the deference to Khublai and his successors as Great Khans of the Mongol Empire. The title Ilkhan carried by the descendants of Hülegü and, later, other Borjigin princes in the Middle East, does not appear in the sources until after 1260. All Ilkhans from Hülegü to Ghazan minted coins in &quot;the name of the Qaghan&quot;. Ghazan omitted the name of the Great Khan from his coins, however, his coins from Georgia inscribed the traditional Mongolian formula &quot;Struck by Ghazan in the Name of the Qaghan [Great Khan]&quot;. Ghazan also received an imperial seal, declaring him a prince from the sixth Great Khan Temür Khan.

In a 1290 letter sent to Pope Nicholas IV, Arghun called himself Ilkhan [&quot;Il qan&quot; in Mongolian]. The continued use of the title &quot;Ilkhan&quot; outside of the Mongol coinage in Iran suggests
that Ghazan and his Muslim successors still carried the title in the fourteenth century. Indeed, Öljaitü and Abu Sa&#x27;id held the title of Ilkhan along with their Islamic, Mongolian and Persian titles.

The State of the Ilkhanate was known as the ulus of Hülegü to the Mongols during that time. Kublai Khan and his successors regarded the Ilkhans as subordinate rulers, a view corroborated by Persian sources, which note that the Great Khans issued edicts and patents of authority to confirm the coronation of Ilkhans such as Abagha and Arghun. In the official History of the Yuan dynasty, the Ilkhans are termed &quot;Prince of the Blood&quot; or &quot;Imperial Prince&quot;. The Yuan rulers conferred upon the Ilkhan&#x27;s great commanders and viziers (ministers) prestigious titles such as Chancellor, the Minister of the Branch Office of the Revenue Ministry, the Minister for Assisting Government and Pacifying People, Commander Unequalled in Honor, and Superintendent of Hermitage Bureau along with seals. For example, the Great Khan Yesün Temür (r. 1323–1328) granted the Ilkhanid great commander Chupan the prestigious title &quot;vice-grand minister for establishing the governance&quot; and the noble rank of Duke of Yi, along with a golden tablet and a seal. Chupan used the seal to stamp official documents. To reinforce their authority, both Kublai and his successor Temür dispatched their own agents, including Bolad, Qadan, and Baiju, to Iran to oversee and influence Ilkhanid politics.

In his letter dispatched to Philip IV of France in 1305, the Il-Khan Öljaitü addressed only Temür with the title Qaghan (Great Khan) and treated other Chinggisid khans of the Golden Horde and Central Asia as his equals.

==Government==
In contrast to the China-based Yuan dynasty, who excluded the native population from gaining control of high offices, the Ilkhanids ruled their realm through a Central Asian–Persian (&quot;Tajik&quot;) administration in partnership with Turco-Mongol military officers. Not all of the Persian administrators were Muslims or members of the traditional families that had served the Seljuqs and Khwarazmians (e.g., the Juvayni family). For example, the Ilkhanate vizier from 1288 to 1291 was Sa&#x27;ad al-Dawla, a Jew, while the prominent vizier and historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani was a Jewish convert to Islam.

The Ilkhanid rulers, who were keen to increase their autonomy, supported their Persian bureaucrats&#x27; promotion of the traditional Iranian idea of kingship. The Persian concept of monarchy over a territorial empire, or more specifically, the &quot;Kingship of the Land of Iran&quot; (&quot;pādshāhi-ye Irān-zamin&quot;), was easily sold to their Mongol masters by these bureaucrats. A lasting effect of the Mongol conquests was the emergence of the &quot;national state&quot; in Iran during the Ilkhanate era.

The Ilkhanate Mongols remained nomadic in their way of life until the end of the dynasty. Their nomadic routes covered central Iraq, northwest Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. The Mongols administered Iraq, the Caucasus, and western and southern Iran directly with the exception of Georgia, the Artuqid sultan of Mardin, and Kufa and Luristan. The Qara&#x27;unas Mongols ruled Khorasan as an autonomous realm and did not pay taxes. Herat&#x27;s local Kart dynasty also remained autonomous. Anatolia was the richest province of the Ilkhanate, supplying a quarter of its revenue while Iraq and Diyarbakir together supplied about 35 percent of its revenue.

In 1330, the annexation of Abkhazia resulted in the reunification of the Kingdom of Georgia. However, tribute received by the Il-Khans from Georgia sank by about three-quarters between 1336 and 1350 because of wars and famines.

==Diplomacy==

The courts of Western Europe made many attempts to ally with the Mongols, primarily with the Ilkhanate, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, starting from around the time of the Seventh Crusade in the mid-13th century. (Western Europeans were collectively called &#x27;Franks&#x27; – &#x27;&#x27;Farang&#x27;, &#x27;Faranji&#x27; – by Muslims and Asians in the era of the Crusades.) Despite their shared opposition to the Muslims, primarily the Mamluk Sultanate, no formal alliance ever was concluded.

While Abu Sa&#x27;id eventually concluded a peace treaty with the Mamluks in 1322, the rivalry between the two powers continued diplomatically. Abu Sa&#x27;id, as a Muslim ruler, sought to demonstrate his legitimacy further abroad in Islamic terms, particularly through efforts to exert influence over the two holy cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina. Even prior to the peace treaty&#x27;s conclusion, the Ilkhan began sending large and richly-equipped pilgrimage (&quot;hajj&quot;) caravans from Iraq. In 1330 he went so far as to include, at great cost, an elephant in the caravan. He also arranged for his name to be read aloud in the &quot;khutba&quot; (Friday sermon) in Medina for a time in 1318 and sent the &quot;kiswa&quot; (the ceremonial cloth covering the Kaaba) to Mecca in 1319. In 1325, Chupan undertook the pilgrimage and sponsored repairs to the water supply in Mecca and the construction of a madrasa (college) and a hammam (bathhouse) in Medina. These actions challenged the primacy of the Mamluks in the Hejaz and provoked the Mamluk sultan, al-Nasir Muhammad, into repeatedly reasserting his dominance in the region by sponsoring his own works there, by purging or replacing local officials, and by undertaking the &quot;hajj&quot; pilgrimage himself.

== Culture ==
=== Literature ===

The Ilkhanid period saw the creation of numerous written works devoted to history. They were typically intended for Ilkhanid administrators or even written for a particular ruler. Many of the writers in the early period were scholars who were trained under pre-Mongol dynasties but received patronage under the new regime. The most famous work of this time is the &quot;Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh&quot; (&#x27;Compendium of Histories&#x27;) of Rashid al-Din, initially commissioned by Ghazan but presented to Öljeitü upon its completion in 1307. Its first surviving volume is a history of the Mongol dynasty while the second is a history of the Iranian and Islamic world, along with stories of other cultures. Ghazan also patronized Abu al-Qasim Qashani, who composed the &quot;Ta&#x27;rikh-i Uljaytu&quot; (&#x27;History of Öljeitü&#x27;), and Shihab al-Din Waṣṣaf, who wrote the &quot;Tajziyat al-amṣar wa-tazjiyat al-a&#x27;ṣar&quot; (&#x27;The Allocation of Cities and Propulsion of Epochs&#x27;). The latter was intended as a continuation of Ala&#x27; al-Din Juvayni&#x27;s slightly earlier work, &quot;Tārikh-i jahangusha&quot; (&#x27;History of the World Conqueror&#x27;) which narrates the fall of the Khwarazmian Empire and the rise of the Mongol Empire. Various other works were also commissioned.

The later years of the Ilkhanate were also marked by interest in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the Iranian epic by 11th-century poet Firdowsi. Not only were new copies of the work produced, but it also inspired new historical works that copied its style and format, such as those of Hamdallah Mustawfi.

=== Arts ===

Among the arts patronized by the Ilkhans, the most important were the arts of the book. The major centers of manuscript production and illumination were Mosul and Baghdad in Iraq. They matched the quality of contemporary production in the Mamluk Sultanate and may have influenced the latter, as there are artistic similarities between Mamluk and Ilkhanid manuscripts. One notable development in this period is the production of manuscripts with very large pages, up to in size, with accordingly large scripts, particularly in &quot;muhaqqaq&quot; style. Illustrations were common and are found in works on a variety of topics such as history, nature, religion, and astronomy. Among these was also an increased production of copies of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. The most celebrated copy is the Great Mongol &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, a large manuscript probably produced for Abu Sa&#x27;id in the 14th century. Its pages include highly expressive illustrations that reflect influences from across Eurasia, including China and Europe. Some two dozen large-scale Qur&#x27;ans have survived and are among the most impressive artistically produced Qur&#x27;ans created up to this point. They were each produced over many years – one of the smaller examples from Baghdad took four years to transcribe and eight years to decorate – and feature elaborate multi-coloured frontispieces with geometric designs similar to those seen in Ilkhanid architecture such as the Sultaniyya Mausoleum.
High-quality silk textiles were also produced under the Ilkhanids. The most important surviving example – possibly the only one definitively attributable to the Ilkhanate – is the large fragment of a burial robe for Duke Rudolf IV of Austria (d. 1365), which was made from an Iranian import. The textile was originally manufactured in an Ilkhanid state workshop, most likely in Tabriz, and bears the name and titles of Abu Sa&#x27;id after 1319. It is woven in lampas and compound weaves in tan and red colours, with gold wefts. It features a motif of broad alternating bands: one set of stripes is filled with a repeating pattern of rhomboids and ornate medallions with vegetal motifs and peacocks in between them, while the other stripes are filled with large epigraphic inscriptions in Arabic script. Between these are narrower bands filled with other animals. The use of this piece for a royal funerary shroud in Europe suggests that Iranian textiles were still highly prized abroad during this period.

In metalwork, Ilkhanid productions were often larger and more richly-decorated than earlier Iranian works. Major centers of production included Tabriz and Shiraz. Surviving pieces are often made of brass inlaid with copper, a type known in previous periods, as well as brass inlaid with gold, a newer trend used for more costly court objects. Among these examples is the base of the largest preserved candlestick from Islamic-era Iran, commissioned by one of Öljeitü&#x27;s viziers in 1308–09 and measuring high. Objects in gold and silver were likely also important but no examples have survived.
Ceramic production was of good quality but not as fine and as diverse as pottery from the preceding century. The type most commonly attributed to Ilkhanid Iran is the so-called &quot;Sultanabad&quot; ceramics. These were made of a softer white paste with a green or gray-brown slip. Bowls of this type were typically underglaze-painted with animal figures with a background of leaves. Kashan remained an important center of lustreware production until the late 13th century, although it ceased producing ceramic vessels after 1284 and then produced only tiles until 1340. The designs were less accomplished than in previous periods but they started to incorporate new Chinese-inspired motifs such as lotuses and simurghs. Starting around the 1270s or 1280s, a new style of expensive ceramic started to be produced, known as &quot;lajvardina&quot;, from the Persian word for lapis lazuli. These often had a deep blue or sometimes blue-ish turquoise glaze and were then overglaze-painted with red, black, white, and gold colours. These have been found at Takht-i Sulaymān and they may have replaced the pre-Mongol &quot;mina&#x27;i&quot; ceramics.

==Legacy==
The emergence of the Ilkhanate had an important historical impact in West Asia. The establishment of the unified Mongol Empire had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia. The communications between the Ilkhanate and the Yuan dynasty headquartered in China encouraged this development. The dragon clothing of Imperial China was used by the Ilkhanids, the Chinese Huangdi (Emperor) title was used by the Ilkhanids due to heavy influence upon the Mongols of the Chinese system of politics. Seals with Chinese characters were created by the Ilkhanids themselves besides the seals they received from the Yuan dynasty which contain references to a Chinese government organization.

The Ilkhanate also helped to pave the way for the later Safavid dynastic state, and ultimately the modern country of Iran. Hulagu&#x27;s conquests had also opened Iran to Chinese influence from the east. This, combined with patronage from his successors, would develop Iran&#x27;s distinctive excellence in architecture. Under the Ilkhans, Iranian historians also moved from writing in Arabic to writing in their native Persian tongue.

The rudiments of double-entry accounting were practiced in the Ilkhanate; merdiban was then adopted by the Ottoman Empire. These developments were independent from the accounting practices used in Europe. This accounting system was adopted primarily as the result of socio-economic necessities created by the agricultural and fiscal reforms of Ghazan Khan in 1295–1304.

===Ilkhan as a tribal title in 19th/20th century Iran===
The title ilkhan resurfaced among the Qashqai nomads of southern Iran in the 19th century. Jan Mohammad Khan started using it in 1818/19, and this was continued by all the following Qashqai leaders. The last Qashqai ilkhan was Nasir Khan, who in 1954 was pushed into exile after his support of Mohammad Mosaddegh. When he returned during the Islamic revolution in 1979, he could not regain his previous position and died in 1984 as the last Ilkhan of the Qashqai.

<text>Donald Wayne Riegle Jr. ( ; born February 4, 1938) is an American politician, author, and businessman from Michigan. He served for five terms as a Representative and for three terms as a Senator in the U.S. Congress.

==Early life and family==
Donald Wayne Riegle Jr. was born on February 4, 1938, to Donald Wayne Riegle Sr., son of John Louis Riegle, owner of the Riegle Press and future mayor of Flint, MI and Dorothy Grace Riegle in Flint, Michigan. Riegle is a graduate of Flint Central High School.

He attended Flint Junior College (now Mott Community College) and Western Michigan University, graduated with a B.A in business administration and economics from the University of Michigan-Flint in 1960, and received an M.B.A. in finance from Michigan State University in 1961.
Riegle was employed by IBM as a financial analyst from 1961 to 1964. He completed required course work for doctoral studies in business and government relations at Harvard Business School, 1964 to 1966 before he left to run for Congress. Riegle taught at Michigan State University, Boston University, the University of Southern California, and Harvard University.

==Political life==
===U.S. Representative===
In 1966, Richard Nixon persuaded Riegle to return to Michigan to run for Congress.
Riegle was then 28 years old and considered to be a moderate Republican. Nixon attended an early campaign fundraiser, and talked up Riegle&#x27;s prospects to reporters.

Riegle defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative John C. Mackie, to be elected from Michigan&#x27;s 7th congressional district to the 90th Congress. Mackie was one of the Michigan Five Fluke Freshmen who lost their seats after a single term.

In 1973, Riegle changed party affiliation to become a Democrat over differences with the Nixon-Agnew Administration regarding the Vietnam War and the &quot;Southern strategy&quot;.[] He was re-elected as a Democrat to the 94th Congress. He did not run for reelection to the House in 1976, but announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate to succeed retiring Senator Philip Hart and defeated Michigan Secretary of State Richard H. Austin and fellow Congressman James G. O&#x27;Hara in the Democratic primary. He defeated Republican Congressman Marvin L. Esch in the general election.

In 1973 Riegle was one of the co-sponsors of H.R. 8163, a bill to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status in the granting of credit, also known as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Sponsored by Congresswoman Bella Abzug, the Equal Credit Opportunity was passed by the House and the Senate in 1974 and was signed into law by President Gerald Ford on October 28, 1974.

===U.S. senator===
Riegle was elected to the United States Senate in 1976 over Republican Marvin Esch. On December 30, 1976, before Riegle&#x27;s term was set to begin, he was appointed early by Governor William Milliken due to the death of Senator Hart for the term ending January 3, 1977. He was reelected to the Senate in 1982 and again in 1988. Riegle&#x27;s 1988 election was the largest Democratic margin of victory in the state&#x27;s history until being surpassed by Carl Levin in 2008. Riegle did not seek re-election in 1994.

He served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 1989–1995. Riegle also served on the Senate Committee on Finance, where he served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health for Families and the Uninsured, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, where he served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, where he served as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Science and Space, and was a member of the Senate Committee on Budget from 1979 to 1995.

In the area of banking reform, Chairman Riegle led the efforts to enact the &quot;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&quot;FDICIA&quot;), which preserved the ability of the FDIC to protect depositors and reformed the way banks are run and regulated. FDICIA also restricted the &quot;too big to fail policy&quot;, strengthened regulation of foreign banks in the U.S., and improved disclosure requirements for banks to consumers.

Chairman Riegle also led the effort to create a system of community development banks. The &quot;Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994&quot; established the Community Development financial institutions Fund to seed and support financial institutions dedicated to supporting community development. The legislation also provided increased consumer protections for high rate home equity loans, contained measures to increase credit availability to small businesses, streamline the regulation of depository institutions, and reform the National Flood Insurance Program.

The &quot;Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994&quot; eliminated restrictions on interstate banking by permitting bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, permitted banks to merge across state lines unless states opt-out, and reduced the competitive advantages that foreign banks had in the U.S. market over U.S. banks.

In 1994, Riegle led an investigation of the illnesses being experienced by veterans of the Gulf War, using the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee over &quot;dual use&quot; exports—materials and technology that could be converted to military use. The resulting investigative report to the Senate detailed at least three occasions on which U. S. military forces came into contact with chemical warfare agents that may have led to the development of Gulf War syndrome and that at least some of those biological agents (weapons of mass destruction) had been provided to Saddam Hussein by the US. Commonly referred to as the Riegle Report to the U.S. Senate, the report called for further government investigation and recourse for war veterans suffering from Gulf War syndrome.

In his first action as Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Riegle led the efforts to reform the savings and loan industry, which resulted in the Financial Institutions Recovery, Reform, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&quot;FIRREA&quot;).[3] The toughest financial reform bill in 50 years, FIRREA ended the abuses and reformed the savings and loan industry. FIRREA put controls on state-chartered thrifts, stopped excessive risk taking by savings and loans, limited brokered deposits, banned junk bond investments, and set new capital requirements for savings and loans.

==Later life==
In 1972, he authored a best-selling book, &quot;O Congress,&quot; with Trevor Armbrister, Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc. The book provides an inside look at the workings of Congress, Riegle&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War, and his break with the Nixon White House.

In 1995, he joined Weber Shandwick Public Affairs, in Washington, D.C. There, he was instrumental in building the company&#x27;s government affairs practice and played an important part in the procurement of Powell Tate, a government affairs firm that is now owned by Weber Shandwick and still operating in Washington D.C., under its independent brand. As the company grew, he took on more responsibility and eventually served as deputy chairman. He joined public relations firm APCO Worldwide in 2001, as chairman of government relations in Washington, D.C.

Riegle endorsed Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in both 2016 and 2020.

<doc id="542306" wikidata="Q15978655" url="?curid=542306" title="Consultant">
<text>A consultant (from &quot;to deliberate&quot;) is a professional (also known as &quot;expert&quot;, &quot;specialist&quot;, see variations of meaning below) who provides advice or services in an area of specialization (generally to medium or large-size corporations). Consulting services generally fall under the domain of professional services, as contingent work.

The Harvard Business School defines a consultant as someone who advises on &quot;how to modify, proceed in, or streamline a given process within a specialized field&quot;.

== Subject-matter expert vs. consultant ==
According to &quot;Institute of Management Consultants USA&quot;, &quot;The value of a consultant [as compared to a subject-matter expert (SME)] is to be able to correctly diagnose and effectively transform an often ill-defined problem and apply information, resources and processes to create a workable and usable solution. Some experts are good consultants and vice versa, some are neither, few are both.&quot; Another differentiation would be that a consultant sells advice, whereas an expert sells their expertise. Other differentiations exist for consultants vs. coaches or SMEs vs. team leaders.

Consultants do not have to be subject-matter experts as consulting agreements are a form of labor contract - comparable to staffing, which a client procures for more generalized labor, whereas consulting is for more specialized labor. Thus, in contrast to advisory services, which is not a labor contract but an actual service (advisory services never become part of the procuring organization) the market for consulting agreements follows the demand for specialized labor in the form of a consulting procurement, and so while competence and experience is naturally an advantage for when looking to sell consulting services, it is not a prerequisite in the same way that it is for advisory services where the service provider per definition relies on some level of competence and experience for its relevance.

== Contractor vs. consultant ==
Sometimes, the word consultant applies specifically to someone or organization that provides knowledge, advice or service; whereas the contractor builds something for the client.

== Role ==
The role of a consultant outside the medical sphere (where the term is used specifically for a grade of doctor) can fall under one of two general categories:
* Internal consultant: someone who is either employed by or contracted by a client organization, and operates within a client-organization, sometimes within an &quot;internal consultancy unit&quot;.; or
* External consultant: someone who is employed externally to the client, either by a consulting firm, some other agency or as an independent freelancer, whose expertise is provided under contract for a fee or rate.

=== Business case for hiring a consultant ===
By procuring consulting services, clients may acquire access to higher grades of expertise than would be financially feasible for them to retain in-house on a long-term basis. Moreover, clients can control their expenditures on consulting services by only purchasing as much services from the outside consultant as desired. Additionally, consultants are key persons with specific domain-skills in creating strategies, leading change (e.g. digitalization), leadership coaching, interim management (also called &quot;consultant manager&quot;), etc.

Another business-case is that a consultant may save the company money: for example, a specialist tax-consultant who saves the company 20% on its taxes, and only charges 10% in fees, enables the company to net a 10% savings. A portion of professional services in demand for clients are simply not necessary to retain in house, as they may be sporadic in nature, at which a consultant offers a reduction in payroll for the client.

In the UK government sector, since 2010 the Cabinet Office has required government departments to implement spending controls which restrict the appointment of consultants and temporary staff in order to regulate consultancy expenditure and ensure that the use of consultants offers value for money. A National Audit Office report published in 2015 recommended that all UK government departments adopt a &quot;strategic plan&quot; to assess their current skills and expected &quot;skill gaps&quot;, so that their future need for consultants and temporary staff could be better predicted.

=== Delivery of service ===
Consultants provide their services to their clients in a variety of forms. Reports and presentations are often used. Advice can be general (high degree of quality of communication) and also domain-focused. However, in some specialized fields, the consultant may develop as well as implement customized software or other products for the client. Depending on the nature (also named mandate or statement of work or assignment) of the consulting services and the wishes of the client, the advice from the consultant may be made public, by placing the report or presentation online, or the advice may be kept confidential (under a Non-disclosure agreement or within the clients-company), and only given to the senior executives of the organization.

== Employment status and career distinction ==
Consultants work for (consulting) firms or as freelance contractors. A consultant differs from a temporary worker insofar as they have, as detailed above, a highly specialized career and domain knowledge. This could be true for a temporary worker too, however, for example a medical consultant is unlikely to suddenly become a hotel receptionist, whereas a temporary worker might change domains and branches more frequently. Furthermore, a consultant usually signs a service-type employee contract (known as fixed-term, full-time, part-time), whereas a temporary worker will only be offered a temporary (and scope limited) contract or a work-results type contract (e. g. in Germany a specific type of contract called &quot;Werksvertrag&quot;) to fulfill or create a specific work. Additionally, a temporary worker might be directed and managed by a client, whereas a consultant is employed by a company (or self) and provides services for a client. The consultant may not be provided work-related instruments or tools, but only the necessary infrastructure and accesses the consultant needs to fulfill the statement of work, e. g. access to internal IT networks or client-side laboratory. Moreover, a consultant might engage in multi-project services (matrix organization) for the client or for internal projects/activities at the employer firm.

In his book, &quot;The Consulting Bible&quot;, Alan Weiss defines that &quot;When we [consultants] walk away from a client, the client&#x27;s conditions should be better than it was before we arrived or we&#x27;ve failed.&quot; There is no legal protection given to the job title &#x27;consultant&#x27;.

The consultant&#x27;s career path is usually not at the client&#x27;s side, however the consultant will very likely be introduced into the client&#x27;s organizational program or project structure.

Novel collaborations of expert-contractors or &quot;independent consultants&quot; especially in ICT sector exist, e.g. ThoughtWorks.

=== Consulting scope ===
A consultant&#x27;s activity can last anywhere from an hourly consultation, to a one-day service, three months, 12 months or more. For complex projects, a longer period is needed for the consultant to analyze, resolve the root cause, get to know the stakeholders and organizational-situation, etc. Usually the engagement has set legal boundaries under given law to avoid (specifically for freelance-contractors) the problem of false self-employment (see also Umbrella company). The person at client location is sometimes called a &quot;Resident&quot;. By spending time at the client&#x27;s organization, the consultant is able to observe work processes, interview workers, managers, executives, board members, or other individuals, and study how the organization operates to provide their services.

In some settings, a consultant is signing a specific contract and is hired as an interim manager or executive with advanced authority or shared responsibility or decision making of client-side activities, filling a vacant position which could and cannot be filled with an internal candidate. This is often the case by the client-organization due to other constraints, such as corporate compliance and HR-processes, which lead to prolonged hiring paths beyond six months, which is often unacceptable for leadership roles.

=== Work location ===
Research and analysis can occur at the consultants&#x27; offices (sometimes called back office) or home-offices or via remote work. In the case of smaller consulting firms, consultants typically work at the site of the client for at least some of the time. The governing factor on where a consultant works tends to be the amount of interaction required with other employees of the client. If a management consultant is providing advice to a software firm that is struggling with employee morale, absenteeism and issues with resignation by managers and senior engineers, the consultant will probably spend a good deal of time at the client&#x27;s office, interviewing staff, engineers, managers and executives, and observing work processes. On the other hand, a legal consultant asked to provide advice on a specific property law issue might only have a few meetings at the client&#x27;s office, and conduct the majority of his work at the consultant&#x27;s office and in legal libraries.

Similarly, the growth of online, highly skilled consultant freelance marketplaces has begun to grow.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in remote work and demand for online-work skills to continue business or operations.

=== In-house consulting ===
Also known as &quot;ICUs - Internal Consulting Units&quot;, which are departments or specialists groups created by or maintained by usually larger companies for their own consulting service needs along the business chain. &quot;ICUs&quot; might be internal or own-run businesses.

=== Success factors of consulting ===
The following qualities are found to be helpful for a successful consulting career.

==== Accenture success factors ====
From Accenture blog, one of the main IT consultancies in the world, the following factors play an important role:

* A service-oriented mindset
* Sharing of great work
* Seizing of opportunities
* Setting of goals, seeking of advice and taking time to reflect

==== &quot;Bronnenmayer&#x27;s&quot; success factors ====
Bronnenmayer et al. investigated, by applying a structural equation model, and due to little empirical research, the management consulting&#x27;s success factors from a client perspective. It is found that Consultant Expertise, Intensity of Collaboration and Common Vision have strongest performance impact on success.
# Common vision
# Intensity of collaboration
# Trust
# Project management
# Consultant expertise
# Provided resources
# Top management support

==== Sindermann and Sawyer success factors ====
Sindermann and Sawyer conclude in their book &quot;The Scientist as Consultant&quot;, that a [scientific] consultant is successful, if they have &quot;achieved a viable mix of technical proficiency and business skills&quot; with &quot;technical proficiency&quot; meaning excellence in competence, credibility, effective networking with colleagues, and ability to negotiate.

==== Hartel&#x27;s 10 Golden Rules ====
According to management consultant Dirk Hartel, the following ten objectives or rules are key to a successful consulting career:

# Customer first - Especially the meaning of being available (time) for customer needs
# Appearance - Understanding of self-image and dress for the job
# Determined friendliness - Having concrete mindset and goals, but being diplomatic too
# Punctuality - Leading time management, starting and finishing on time, being prepared
# Engagement and productivity - Supporting, being pro-active, etc.
# Critical questioning - Nobody is born a consultant; asking the right questions is a key skill
# Feedback - Request regular feedback, asking for critique rather than waiting for it
# Acceptance of hierarchies - Professional navigation in client organization, knowing authority-levels, being respectful and being confidential with customer information
# Stakeholder behavior - Study and understanding of client behavior and culture; inspiring stakeholders with presentations, etc.
# Being courageous - Consulting-life is challenging, never lose trust in yourself, but also reflect and lead a positive and good life

=== Consulting challenges ===

==== Distinctness ====
Consultants are often outsiders to the client organization. On one hand, this means their work methods, expertise, behaviors, etc. differ from the client-employees and organizational, and is exactly what the client needs, however it can also be a considerable disadvantage for a successful engagement and may lead to a less intimate cooperation with the client&#x27;s business.

==== Domain ====
Next to general challenges, domain-specific challenges for consultants exist. In palliative medicine consulting, emotions, beliefs, sensitive topics, difficulty communicating and prognosis interpretation, or patients expectations despite critical illness are some of the challenges faced by the consultant.

==== Ethical conflict (manipulation) ====
According to Kelman, &quot;One danger is that [the counselor] does not recognize the control that he is exercising over the client&#x27;s behavior. The other is that he is so convinced that he is doing good for the client that he does not realize the double-edged nature of the control he is exercising.&quot; A consultant therefore needs to be aware and in control of her or his manipulative influences in particular counseling settings.

==== Expectations (customer) ====
Hartel mentions several challenges that are based on the types of consultants, including a consultant in a short-term role, as integrator, as driver, as project manager or methodology guru, know-how expert, or as scapegoat.

In case of &quot;consultant as integrator&quot;, the consultant has the challenging task to resolve, negotiate, facilitate, mediate political situations in companies to move forward, such as different opinions, critical characters (persons), difficult relationships or interfaces, goal conflicts, power games, etc.

In case of &quot;consultant as scapegoat&quot;, the consultant, who is external to the company, is the one to announce difficult company decisions such as layoffs or reorganizations, but it is important that the consultant acts professional and competent, not just as &quot;Rambo in suit&quot;.

==== Organizational ====
Consultants may face several organizational challenges, e. g. internal consultants are faced with the paradoxes to maintain a good balance between knowing the internal company structure and at the same time staying neutral and objective, keeping a marginal position between the client and the provided service. Further, depending on the hiring company&#x27;s understanding how to work with a consultant, the consultant might be seen as disruption to the in-house employees status.

====Rates of pay====
Harrington notes that some people transferring from an employee role to working as a consultant are uncertain about how to price their services.

==== Other general challenges ====
General issues faced by a consultant can be stress, productivity issues with meetings, general &quot;technostresses&quot;, high-paced and changing business environments and situations, etc.

==== Stakeholder management ====
In case of corporate and industrial consultants, the role is further challenged to act and become the &quot;translator of information&quot; from various different client-company cultures and procedures (processes) and between her or his employer-side team, managers and leadership team. What is an important goal to the current client is usually not similar for any other client due to multiple variations in company size, history, product, program, organizational structure, leadership, etc. Hence the consultant must be excellent in sensing and communicating between different layers in the organization and further across it, while maintaining authenticity, integrity and trustworthiness with all parties involved.

==== Taxation and legal status ====
Independent consultants (contractors or freelancer) usually need to fulfil taxation requirements given by laws, specifically challenging employment status to avoid &#x27;disguised&#x27; employment.

Compared to contracting, consulting can be seen as being &quot;in business in your own right&quot;, not controlled by your client, etc. placing a consultant &quot;well outside&quot; of e. g. IR35.

Alan Weiss provides 20 &quot;factors&quot; for consultants in the US (IRS), which are similar in other countries, to avoid or understand in terms of their business activity. Amongst those, the consultant is not supposed to be instructed by the client, should not receive similar training as employees, has the right to sub-contract, should not be integrated into the organizational structure, etc. to avoid legal-status and taxation issues.

==Qualifications==
There is no single qualification to becoming a consultant, other than those laid down in relation to medical, psychological and engineering personnel who have attained this level-degree in it or professional licenses, such as Chartered Engineer.

Consultants may hold undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, professional degrees or professional designations pertaining to their field(s) of expertise. In some fields, a consultant may be required to hold certain professional licenses (e.g., a civil engineer providing consulting on a bridge project may have to be a professional engineer). In other types of consulting, there may be no specific qualification requirements. A legal consultant may have to be a member of the bar or hold a law degree. An accounting consultant may have to have an accounting designation, such as Chartered Accountant status. Some individuals become consultants after a lengthy and distinguished career as an executive or political leader or employee, so their lengthy and exposed experience may be their main asset.

== Accreditation ==
Various accreditation bodies for consultants exist:
* AACSB - Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business
*AMBA - Association of MBAs
*CIMC - Chartered Institute of Management Consultants (US)
*CMI - Chartered Management Institute (UK)
**IC - Institute of Consulting (UK)
*EFMD - European Foundation for Management Development (EQUIS)
*FEANI - European federation of professional engineers
*Institute of Management Consultants (IMC USA)
* International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC)
*The International Council of Management Consulting Institutes (ICMCI)
* The Chartered Institute of Legal Executives - (CILEX), UK.
* The Institute of Commercial Management - (ICM), UK.

==Code of Ethics==
Accredited practitioners in all fields (including medical) can be bound by a Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct.

Ethics in the field of business consulting and organizations is still a subject under research.

A thorough discussion of ethics in the field of consultation is given in Lippitt &amp; Lippitt (see also 2nd edition in English). Here the authors mention several guidelines and definitions including Shay, the Association of Consulting Management Engineers (1966), American Society for Training and Development (1977), Academy of Management (1976) and conclude their own codex with the following attributes (see below). Additionally, the authors mention the difficulty in applying the codex and scenarios of how to track adherence and how to judge violations in accordance with other bodies, such as APA (American Psychological Association) and CSPEC (or CSCE) (Committee on Scientific and Professional Ethics) and conclude that &quot;The most important aspect in the formulation of a code of conduct however, is the recognition of a fundamental moral standard. Only then is compliance with the rules guaranteed.&quot;

<doc id="542316" wikidata="Q244226" url="?curid=542316" title="Japanese dry garden">
<text>The or Japanese rock garden, often called a Zen garden, is a distinctive style of Japanese garden. It creates a miniature stylized landscape through carefully composed arrangements of rocks, water features, moss, pruned trees and bushes, and uses gravel or sand that is raked to represent ripples in water. Zen gardens are commonly found at temples or monasteries. A Zen garden is usually relatively small, surrounded by a wall or buildings, and is usually meant to be seen while seated from a single viewpoint outside the garden, such as the porch of the &quot;hojo&quot;, the residence of the chief monk of the temple or monastery. Many, with gravel rather than grass, are only stepped into for maintenance. Classical Zen gardens were created at temples of Zen Buddhism in Kyoto during the Muromachi period. They were intended to imitate the essence of nature, not its actual appearance, and to serve as an aid for meditation.

==History==

===Early Japanese rock gardens===
Stone gardens existed in Japan at least since the Heian period (794–1185). These early gardens were described in the first manual of Japanese gardens, &quot;Sakuteiki&quot; (&quot;Records of Garden Keeping&quot;), written at the end of the 11th century by Tachibana no Toshitsuna (1028–1094). They adapted the Chinese garden philosophy of the Song dynasty (960–1279), where groups of rocks symbolized Mount Penglai, the legendary mountain-island home of the Eight Immortals in Chinese mythology, known in Japanese as Horai. The &quot;Sakuteiki&quot; described exactly how rocks should be placed. In one passage, he wrote:

&quot;In a place where there is neither a lake or a stream, one can put in place what is called a &quot;kare-sansui,&quot; or dry landscape&quot;. This kind of garden featured either rocks placed upright like mountains, or laid out in a miniature landscape of hills and ravines, with few plants. He described several other styles of rock garden, which usually included a stream or pond, including the great river style, the mountain river style, and the marsh style. The ocean style featured rocks that appeared to have been eroded by waves, surrounded by a bank of white sand, like a beach.

White sand and gravel had long been a feature of Japanese gardens. In the Shinto religion, it was used to symbolize purity, and was used around shrines, temples, and palaces. In Zen gardens, it represents water, or, like the white space in Japanese paintings, emptiness and distance. They are places of meditation.

===Zen Buddhism and the Muromachi period (1336–1573)===
The Muromachi period in Japan, which took place at roughly the same time as the Renaissance in Europe, was characterized by political rivalries which frequently led to wars, but also by an extraordinary flourishing of Japanese culture. It saw the beginning of &quot;Noh&quot; theater, the Japanese tea ceremony, the &quot;shoin&quot; style of Japanese architecture, and the Zen garden.

Zen Buddhism was introduced into Japan at the end of the 12th century, and quickly achieved a wide following, particularly among the Samurai class and war lords, who admired its doctrine of self-discipline. The gardens of the early Zen temples in Japan resembled Chinese gardens of the time, with lakes and islands. But in Kyoto in the 14th and 15th century, a new kind of garden appeared at the important Zen temples. These Zen gardens were designed to stimulate meditation. &quot;Nature, if you made it expressive by reducing it to its abstract forms, could transmit the most profound thoughts by its simple presence&quot;, Michel Baridon wrote. &quot;The compositions of stone, already common in China, became in Japan, veritable petrified landscapes, which seemed suspended in time, as in certain moments of Noh theater, which dates to the same period.&quot;

The first garden to begin the transition to the new style is considered by many experts to be Saihō-ji, &quot;The Temple of the Perfumes of the West&quot;, popularly known as Koke-dera, the Moss Temple, in the western part of Kyoto. The Buddhist monk and Zen master Musō Kokushi transformed a Buddhist temple into a Zen monastery in 1334, and built the gardens. The lower garden of Saihō-ji is in the traditional Heian period style; a pond with several rock compositions representing islands. The upper garden is a dry rock garden which features three rock &quot;islands&quot;. The first, called &quot;Kameshima&quot;, the island of the turtle, resembles a turtle swimming in a &quot;lake&quot; of moss. The second, &quot;Zazen-seki&quot;, is a flat &quot;meditation rock,&quot; which is believed to radiate calm and silence; and the third is the &quot;kare-taki&quot;, a dry &quot;waterfall&quot; composed of a stairway of flat granite rocks. The moss which now surrounds the rocks and represents water, was not part of the original garden plan; it grew several centuries later when the garden was left untended, but now is the most famous feature of the garden.

Muso Kokushi built another temple garden at Tenryū-ji, the &quot;Temple of the Celestial Dragon&quot;. This garden appears to have been strongly influenced by Chinese landscape painting of the Song dynasty, which feature mountains rising in the mist, and a suggestion of great depth and height. The garden at Tenryū-ji has a real pond with water and a dry waterfall of rocks looking like a Chinese landscape. Saihō-ji and Tenryū-ji show the transition from the Heian style garden toward a more abstract and stylized view of nature.

The gardens of Ginkaku-ji, also known as the Silver Pavilion, are also attributed to Muso Kokushi. This temple garden included a traditional pond garden, but it had a new feature for a Japanese garden; an area of raked white gravel with a perfectly shaped mountain of white gravel, resembling Mount Fuji, in the center. The scene was called &quot;ginshanada&quot;, literally &quot;sand of silver and open sea&quot;. This garden feature became known as &quot;kogetsudai&quot;, or small mountain facing the Moon, and similar small Mount Fuji made of sand or earth covered with grass appeared in Japanese gardens for centuries afterwards.

The most famous of all Zen gardens in Kyoto is Ryōan-ji, built in the late 15th century where for the first time the Zen garden became purely abstract. The garden is a rectangle of 340 square meters. Placed within it are fifteen stones of different sizes, carefully composed in five groups; one group of five stones, two groups of three, and two groups of two stones. The stones are surrounded by white gravel, which is carefully raked each day by the monks. The only vegetation in the garden is some moss around the stones. The garden is meant to be viewed from a seated position on the veranda of the &quot;hōjō&quot;, the residence of the abbot of the monastery.

The garden at Daisen-in (1509–1513) took a more literary approach than Ryōan-ji. There a &quot;river&quot; of white gravel represents a metaphorical journey through life; beginning with a dry waterfall in the mountains, passing through rapids and rocks, and ending in a tranquil sea of white gravel, with two gravel mountains.

The invention of the Zen garden was closely connected with developments in Japanese ink landscape paintings. Japanese painters such as Sesshū Tōyō (1420–1506) and Soami (died 1525) greatly simplified their views of nature, showing only the most essential aspects of nature, leaving great areas of white around the black and gray drawings. Soami is said to have been personally involved in the design of two of the most famous Zen gardens in Kyoto, Ryōan-ji and Daisen-in, though his involvement has never been documented with certainty.

Michel Baridon wrote, &quot;The famous Zen gardens of the Muromachi period showed that Japan had carried the art of gardens to the highest degree of intellectual refinement that it was possible to attain.&quot;

===Later rock gardens===
During the Edo period, the large promenade garden became the dominant style of Japanese garden, but Zen gardens continued to exist at Zen temples. A few small new rock gardens were built, usually as part of a garden where a real stream or pond was not practical.

In 1880, the buildings of Tōfuku-ji temple in Kyoto, one of the oldest temples in the city, were destroyed by a fire. In 1940, the temple commissioned the landscape historian and architect Shigemori Mirei to recreate the gardens. He created four different gardens, one for each face of the main temple building. He made one garden with five artificial hills covered with grass, symbolizing the five great ancient temples of Kyoto; a modern rock garden, with vertical rocks, symbolizing Mount Horai; a large &quot;sea&quot; of white gravel raked in a checkboard pattern; and an intimate garden with swirling sand patterns.

In the last century, Zen gardens have appeared in many countries outside Japan.

==Selection and arrangement of rocks==
Stone arrangements and other miniature elements are used to represent mountains and natural water elements and scenes, islands, rivers and waterfalls. Stone and shaped shrubs (&quot;karikomi&quot;, &quot;hako-zukuri&quot; topiary) are used interchangeably. In most gardens moss is used as a ground cover to create &quot;land&quot; covered by forest.

The selection and placement of rocks is the most important part of making a Japanese rock garden. In the first known manual of Japanese gardening, the &quot;Sakuteiki&quot; (&quot;Records of Garden Making&quot;), is expressed as &quot;setting stones&quot;, &quot;ishi wo tateru koto&quot;; literally, the &quot;act of setting stones upright.&quot; It laid out very specific rules for choice and the placement of stones, and warned that if the rules were not followed the owner of the garden would suffer misfortune. In Japanese gardening, rocks are classified as either tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining, or flat.

For creating &quot;mountains&quot;, usually igneous volcanic rocks, rugged mountain rocks with sharp edges, are used. Smooth, rounded sedimentary rocks are used for the borders of gravel &quot;rivers&quot; or &quot;seashores.&quot; In Chinese gardens of the Song dynasty, individual rocks which looked like animals or had other unusual features were often the star attraction of the garden. In Japanese gardens, individual rocks rarely play the starring role; the emphasis is upon the harmony of the composition. For arranging rocks, there are many rules in the &quot;Sakuteiki&quot;, for example:
Make sure that all the stones, right down to the front of the arrangement, are placed with their best sides showing. If a stone has an ugly-looking top you should place it so as to give prominence to its side. Even if this means it has to lean at a considerable angle, no one will notice. There should always be more horizontal than vertical stones. If there are &quot;running away&quot; stones there must be &quot;chasing&quot; stones. If there are &quot;leaning&quot; stones, there must be &quot;supporting&quot; stones.
Rocks are rarely if ever placed in straight lines or in symmetrical patterns. The most common arrangement is one or more groups of three rocks. One common triad arrangement has a tall vertical rock flanked by two smaller rocks, representing Buddha and his two attendants. Other basic combinations are a tall vertical rock with a reclining rock; a short vertical rock and a flat rock; and a triad of a tall vertical rock, a reclining rock and a flat rock. Other important principles are to choose rocks which vary in color, shape and size, to avoid rocks with bright colors which might distract the viewer, and make certain that the grains of rocks run in the same direction.

At the end of the Edo period, a new principle was invented: the use of &quot;suteishi&quot;, &quot;discarded&quot; or &quot;nameless&quot; rocks, placed in seemingly random places to add spontaneity to the garden. Other important principles of rock arrangement include balancing the number of vertical and horizontal rocks.

==Gravel==

Gravel is usually used in Zen gardens, rather than sand, because it is less disturbed by rain and wind. The act of raking the gravel into a pattern recalling waves or rippling water, known as or , has an aesthetic function. Zen priests practice this raking also to help their concentration. Achieving perfection of lines is not easy. Rakes are according to the patterns of ridges as desired and limited to some of the stone objects situated within the gravel area. Nonetheless, often the patterns are not static. Developing variations in patterns is a creative and inspiring challenge. There are typically four raking patterns, line, wave, scroll, and check.

The gravel used in Japanese gardens is known as &quot;suna&quot; (sand) despite the individual particles being much bigger than those of what is regarded as normal sand. These vary from 2 mm to up to even 30 to 50 mm in size. 
Gardens in Kyoto have historically used &quot;Shirakawa-suna&quot;, (白川砂利, &quot;Shirakawa-sand&quot;) which is known for its rather muted colour palette. This type of muted black-speckled granite is a mix of three main minerals, white feldspar, grey quartz, and black mica which matches the aesthetic for most Zen gardens. Shirakawa-suna also has an eroded texture that alternates between jagged and smooth and is prized for its ability to hold raked grooves, with patterns that last weeks unless weather, animals or humans intervene.

As of 2018 in Kyoto alone there are 341 areas spread over 166 temples covering a surface area of over 29,000 m2 which have used &quot;Shirakawa-suna&quot;. Gravel is used in the entrance, main garden, and corridor area and takes four forms, spread gravel, gravel terrace, gravel pile, and garden path. Typically in areas covering less than 100 m2, the gravel is 20 to 50 mm deep and has a particle size of 9 mm. 
Among the gardens which used Shirakawa-suna have been Ryōan-ji and Daitoku-ji.
&quot;Shirakawa-suna&quot; was sourced from the upper reaches of the Shirakawa River. However, since the late 1950s the river has been a protected waterway and extraction of gravel from the river has been illegal.
Over time the gravel becomes weather-beaten and becomes finer, forcing gardeners to occasionally replenish it in order for the gravel to retain the patterns made in them.

Since the banning of extraction from the Shirakawa River the gravel used for both maintenance of existing gardens and the creation of new ones is sourced from quarried mountain granite of similar composition that is crushed and sieved. However the process of manufacturing creates rounded particles of the same size, lacking the pattern holding characteristics of true &quot;Shirakawa-suna&quot;, which have corners and are not uniform in size. For instance the Portland Japanese Garden experimented with granite chips sourced from Canadian quarries to compensate for the loss of access to Shirakawa-suna.

Maintenance of the gravel in Japan is typically undertaken two to three times per month.

==Symbolism==
In the Japanese rock garden, rocks sometimes symbolize mountains (particularly Horai, the legendary home of the Eight Immortals in Taoist mythology); or they can be boats or a living creature (usually a turtle, or a carp). In a group, they might be a waterfall or a crane in flight.

In the earliest rock gardens of the Heian period, the rocks in a garden sometimes had a political message. As the Sakutei-ki wrote:

Sometimes, when mountains are weak, they are without fail destroyed by water. It is, in other words, as if subjects had attacked their emperor. A mountain is weak if it does not have stones for support. An emperor is weak if he does not have counselors. That is why it is said that it is because of stones that a mountain is sure, and thanks to his subjects that an emperor is secure. It is for this reason that, when you construct a landscape, you must at all cost place rocks around the mountain.
Some classical Zen gardens, like Daisen-in, have symbolism that can be easily read; it is a metaphorical journey on the river of life. Others, like Ryōan-ji, resist easy interpretation. Many different theories have been put forward about what the garden is supposed to represent, from islands in a stream to swimming baby tigers to the peaks of mountains rising above the clouds to theories about secrets of geometry or of the rules of equilibrium of odd numbers. Garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote: &quot;The garden at Ryōan-ji does not symbolize anything, or more precisely, to avoid any misunderstanding, the garden of Ryōan-ji does not symbolize, nor does it have the value of reproducing a natural beauty that one can find in the real or mythical world. I consider it to be an abstract composition of &quot;natural&quot; objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite meditation.&quot;

A recent suggestion by Gert van Tonder of Kyoto University and Michael Lyons of Ritsumeikan University is that the rocks of Ryōan-ji form the subliminal image of a tree. The researchers claim the subconscious mind is sensitive to a subtle association between the rocks. They suggest this may be responsible for the calming effect of the garden.

==Landscape painting and the Zen garden critique==

Chinese landscape painting was one of the many Chinese arts that came to Japan with Zen Buddhism in the fourteenth century. That the Buddhism of Zen influenced garden design was first suggested not in Japan, but in the West by a Hawaiian garden journalist Loraine Kuck in the 1930s and disputed as such by a scholar of Japanese garden history, Wybe Kuitert in 1988. This was well before scholars jumped on the bandwagon in the 1990s to deconstruct the promotion and reception of Zen. The critique comes down to the fact that Buddhist priests were not trying to express Zen in gardens. A review of the quotes of Buddhist priests that are taken to &quot;prove&quot; Zen for the garden are actually phrases copied from Chinese treatises on landscape painting. Secondary writers on the Japanese garden like Keane and Nitschke, who were associating with Kuitert when he was working on his research at the Kyoto University joined the Zen garden critique, like Kendall H. Brown, who took a similar distance from the Zen garden. In Japan the critique was taken over by Yamada Shouji who took a critical stance to the understanding of all Japanese culture, including gardens, under the nominator of Zen. Christian Tagsold summarized the discussion by placing perceptions of the Japanese garden in the context of an interdisciplinary comparison of cultures of Japan and the West.

Zen priests quote from Chinese treatises on landscape painting indicating that the Japanese rock garden, and its karesansui garden scenery was and still is inspired by or based on first Chinese and later also Japanese landscape painting. Landscape painting and landscape gardening were closely related and practiced by intellectuals, the literati inspired by Chinese culture. A primary design principle was the creation of a landscape based on, or at least greatly influenced by, the three-dimensional monochrome ink (&quot;sumi&quot;) landscape painting, &quot;sumi-e&quot; or &quot;suiboku-ga&quot;. 

In Japan, the garden has the same status as a work of art. Though each garden is different in its composition, they mostly use rock groupings and shrubs to represent a classic scene of mountains, valleys and waterfalls taken from Chinese landscape painting. In some cases it might be as abstract as just a few islands in a sea. Any Japanese garden may also incorporate existing scenery outside its confinement, e.g. the hills behind, as &quot;borrowed scenery&quot; (using a technique called &quot;Shakkei&quot;).

Notice that the set &quot;A&quot; need not be &quot;μ&quot;-measurable: &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is however well defined as &quot;μ&quot; is an outer measure.
An outer measure satisfying only the first of these two requirements is called a &quot;Borel measure&quot;, while an outer measure satisfying only the second requirement (with the Borel set B replaced by a measurable set B) is called a &quot;regular measure&quot;.

The Lebesgue outer measure on R&quot;n&quot; is an example of a Borel regular measure.

It can be proved that a Borel regular measure, although introduced here as an &quot;outer&quot; measure (only countably &quot;sub&quot;additive), becomes a full measure (countably additive) if restricted to the Borel sets.

<text>Æthelric (died &quot;c&quot;. 604?) was supposedly a King of Deira (&quot;c&quot;. 589/599–&quot;c&quot;. 604). He is thought to have succeeded Ælla of Deira, but his existence is historically obscure.

Manuscript A of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Ælle, king of Deira, was succeeded by Æthelric in 588, who reigned for five years. According to Bede, Deira was invaded and taken over by Æthelfrith of Bernicia in about the year 604. The circumstances of this are unclear, and Æthelric&#x27;s fate is unknown. The fact that Edwin, a son of Ælla and possibly Æthelric&#x27;s brother, had to flee into exile suggests that Deira may have been conquered by Æthelfrith, and in this case Æthelric may have been killed during warfare. Æthelfrith ruled both Deira and Bernicia, the two components of Northumbria, until he was killed in battle and the Deiran line was restored for a time under Edwin.

<doc id="542336" wikidata="Q2919100" url="?curid=542336" title="Artinian module">
<text>In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, an Artinian module is a module that satisfies the descending chain condition on its poset of submodules. They are for modules what Artinian rings are for rings, and a ring is Artinian if and only if it is an Artinian module over itself (with left or right multiplication). Both concepts are named for Emil Artin.

In the presence of the axiom of (dependent) choice, the descending chain condition becomes equivalent to the minimum condition, and so that may be used in the definition instead.

Like Noetherian modules, Artinian modules enjoy the following heredity property:
* If &quot;M&quot; is an Artinian &quot;R&quot;-module, then so is any submodule and any quotient of &quot;M&quot;.
The converse also holds:
* If &quot;M&quot; is any &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;N&quot; any Artinian submodule such that &quot;M&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is Artinian, then &quot;M&quot; is Artinian.
As a consequence, any finitely-generated module over an Artinian ring is Artinian. Since an Artinian ring is also a Noetherian ring, and finitely-generated modules over a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, it is true that for an Artinian ring &quot;R&quot;, any finitely-generated &quot;R&quot;-module is both Noetherian and Artinian, and is said to be of finite length. It also follows that any finitely generated Artinian module is Noetherian even without the assumption of &quot;R&quot; being Artinian. However, if &quot;R&quot; is not Artinian and &quot;M&quot; is not finitely-generated, there are counterexamples.

==Left and right Artinian rings, modules and bimodules==
The ring &quot;R&quot; can be considered as a right module, where the action is the natural one given by the ring multiplication on the right. &quot;R&quot; is called right Artinian when this right module &quot;R&quot; is an Artinian module. The definition of &quot;left Artinian ring&quot; is done analogously. For noncommutative rings this distinction is necessary, because it is possible for a ring to be Artinian on one side but not the other.

The left-right adjectives are not normally necessary for modules, because the module &quot;M&quot; is usually given as a left or right &quot;R&quot;-module at the outset. However, it is possible that &quot;M&quot; may have both a left and right &quot;R&quot;-module structure, and then calling &quot;M&quot; Artinian is ambiguous, and it becomes necessary to clarify which module structure is Artinian. To separate the properties of the two structures, one can abuse terminology and refer to &quot;M&quot; as left Artinian or right Artinian when, strictly speaking, it is correct to say that &quot;M&quot;, with its left &quot;R&quot;-module structure, is Artinian.

The occurrence of modules with a left and right structure is not unusual: for example &quot;R&quot; itself has a left and right &quot;R&quot;-module structure. In fact this is an example of a bimodule, and it may be possible for an abelian group &quot;M&quot; to be made into a left-&quot;R&quot;, right-&quot;S&quot; bimodule for a different ring &quot;S&quot;. Indeed, for any right module &quot;M&quot;, it is automatically a left module over the ring of integers Z, and moreover is a Z-&quot;R&quot;-bimodule. For example, consider the rational numbers Q as a Z-Q-bimodule in the natural way. Then Q is not Artinian as a left Z-module, but it is Artinian as a right Q-module.

The Artinian condition can be defined on bimodule structures as well: an Artinian bimodule is a bimodule whose poset of sub-bimodules satisfies the descending chain condition. Since a sub-bimodule of an &quot;R&quot;-&quot;S&quot;-bimodule &quot;M&quot; is a fortiori a left &quot;R&quot;-module, if &quot;M&quot; considered as a left &quot;R&quot;-module were Artinian, then &quot;M&quot; is automatically an Artinian bimodule. It may happen, however, that a bimodule is Artinian without its left or right structures being Artinian, as the following example will show.

&quot;Example:&quot; It is well known that a simple ring is left Artinian if and only if it is right Artinian, in which case it is a semisimple ring. Let &quot;R&quot; be a simple ring which is not right Artinian. Then it is also not left Artinian. Considering &quot;R&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-&quot;R&quot;-bimodule in the natural way, its sub-bimodules are exactly the ideals of &quot;R&quot;. Since &quot;R&quot; is simple there are only two: &quot;R&quot; and the zero ideal. Thus the bimodule &quot;R&quot; is Artinian as a bimodule, but not Artinian as a left or right &quot;R&quot;-module over itself.

==Relation to the Noetherian condition==
Unlike the case of rings, there are Artinian modules which are not Noetherian modules. For example, consider the &quot;p&quot;-primary component of formula_1, that is formula_2, which is isomorphic to the &quot;p&quot;-quasicyclic group formula_3, regarded as formula_4-module. The chain formula_5 does not terminate, so formula_3 (and therefore formula_1) is not Noetherian. Yet every descending chain of (without loss of generality) proper submodules terminates: Each such chain has the form formula_8 for some integers formula_9, and the inclusion of formula_10 implies that formula_11 must divide formula_12. So formula_9 is a decreasing sequence of positive integers. Thus the sequence terminates, making formula_3 Artinian.

Note that formula_2 is also a faithful formula_4 module. So, this also provides an example of a faithful Artinian module over a non-artinian ring. This does not happen for Noetherian case; If &quot;M&quot; is a faithful Noetherian module over &quot;A&quot; then &quot;A&quot; is Noetherian as well.

Over a commutative ring, every cyclic Artinian module is also Noetherian, but over noncommutative rings cyclic Artinian modules can have uncountable length as shown in the article of Hartley and summarized nicely in the Paul Cohn article dedicated to Hartley&#x27;s memory.

Another relevant result is the Akizuki–Hopkins–Levitzki theorem, which states that the Artinian and Noetherian conditions are equivalent for modules over a semiprimary ring.

<doc id="542341" wikidata="Q2089525" url="?curid=542341" title="List of forms of government">
<text>This article lists forms of government and political systems, which are not mutually exclusive, and often have much overlap. According to Yale professor Juan José Linz there are three main types of political systems today: democracies, 
totalitarian regimes and, sitting between these two, authoritarian regimes with hybrid regimes. Another modern classification system includes monarchies as a standalone entity or as a hybrid system of the main three. Scholars generally refer to a dictatorship as either a form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism.

The ancient Greek philosopher Plato discusses in the &quot;Republic&quot; five types of regimes: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. 
 The question raised by Plato in the &quot;Republic&quot;: What kind of state is best? Generational changes informed by new political and cultural beliefs, technological progress, values and morality over millenniums have resulted in considerable shifts in the belief about the origination of political authority, who may participate in matters of state, how people might participate, the determination of what is just, and so forth.

==Basic forms of governments==
Index of Forms of Government.

== Forms of government by regional control ==
==Forms of government by power source==
=== Types of democracy ===

=== Types of oligarchy ===
Oligarchies are societies controlled and organised by a small &quot;class&quot; of privileged people, with no intervention from the most part of society; this small elite is defined as sharing some common trait.

&quot;De jure&quot; democratic governments with a &quot;de facto&quot; oligarchy are ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers. (Ancient Greek ὀλιγαρχία (oligarkhía) literally meant &quot;rule by few&quot;)

Some historical examples of oligarchy include the Roman Republic, in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the Athenian democracy, which used sortition to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status. Some critics of capitalism and/or representative democracy think of the United States and the United Kingdom as oligarchies.

&quot;These categories are not exclusive.&quot;
=== Types of autocracy ===
Autocracies are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a dictatorship or it may be a group, as in a one-party state. The word despotism means to &quot;rule in the fashion of despots&quot; and is often used to describe autocracy.

Historical examples of autocracy include the Roman Empire, North Korea, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Eritrea and Nazi Germany.

=== Pejorative attributes ===
Regardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with political power which are not part of the formal government. These are terms that highlight certain actions of the governors, such as corruption, demagoguery, or fear mongering that may disrupt the intended way of working of the government if they are widespread enough.
===Other attributes===
== Forms of government by power ideology ==
=== Types of monarchy ===
Countries with monarchy attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the , represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical (crowned republic) to partial and restricted (constitutional monarchy) to completely despotic (absolute monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is inherited, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected.
=== Types of republic ===
Rule by a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people. A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch. Montesquieu included both democracies, where all the people have a share in rule, and aristocracies or oligarchies, where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.

&quot;These categories are not exclusive.&quot;
== Forms of government by socio-economic attributes ==
=== By socio-economic attributes ===

Many political systems can be described as socioeconomic ideologies. Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

&quot;These categories are not exclusive.&quot;
=== Types of government by geo-cultural attributes ===
Governments can also be categorized based on their size and scope of influence:
== Forms of government by other attributes ==
=== By significant constitutional attributes ===
Certain major characteristics are defining of certain types; others are historically associated with certain types of government.
* Civilian control of the military vs. stratocracy
* Majority rule or parliamentary sovereignty vs. bill of rights or arbitrary rules with separation of powers and supermajority rules to prevent tyranny of the majority and protect minority rights
* Rule according to higher law (unwritten ethical principles) vs. written constitutionalism
* Separation of church and state or free church vs. state religion
* Totalitarianism or authoritarianism vs. libertarianism

=== By approach to regional autonomy ===
This list focuses on differing approaches that political systems take to the distribution of sovereignty, and the autonomy of regions within the state.
* Sovereignty located exclusively at the centre of political jurisdiction
** Empire
* Sovereignty located at the centre and in peripheral areas
** Federal monarchy
** Hegemony
* Diverging degrees of sovereignty
** Alliance
** Asymmetrical federalism
** Chartered company
** Client state
*** Associated state
*** Dependent territory
*** Protectorate
*** Puppet state
*** Satellite state
*** Vassal state
** Colony
*** Crown colony
** Commonwealth
** &quot;Corpus separatum&quot;
** Decentralisation and devolution (powers redistributed from central to regional or local governments)
** Federacy
** Junta
** Mandate
** Military frontier
** Neutral zone
** Non-self-governing territories
** Occupied territory
** Provisional government
** Thalassocracy
** Unrecognized state
*** Government in exile
*** Micronation
*** Separatist movement
*** States with limited recognition

=== Theoretical and speculative attributes ===
These have no conclusive historical or current examples outside of speculation and scholarly debate.

<text>In mathematics, a pyramid number, or square pyramidal number, is a natural number that counts the stacked spheres in a pyramid with a square base. The study of these numbers goes back to Archimedes and Fibonacci. They are part of a broader topic of figurate numbers representing the numbers of points forming regular patterns within different shapes.

As well as counting spheres in a pyramid, these numbers can be described algebraically as a sum of the first formula_1 positive square numbers, or as the values of a cubic polynomial. They can be used to solve several other counting problems, including counting squares in a square grid and counting acute triangles formed from the vertices of an odd regular polygon. They equal the sums of consecutive tetrahedral numbers, and are one-fourth of a larger tetrahedral number. The sum of two consecutive square pyramidal numbers is an octahedral number.

==History==
The pyramidal numbers were one of the few types of three-dimensional figurate numbers studied in Greek mathematics, in works by Nicomachus, Theon of Smyrna, and Iamblichus. Formulas for summing consecutive squares to give a cubic polynomial, whose values are the square pyramidal numbers, are given by Archimedes, who used this sum as a lemma as part of a study of the volume of a cone, and by Fibonacci, as part of a more general solution to the problem of finding formulas for sums of progressions of squares. The square pyramidal numbers were also one of the families of figurate numbers studied by Japanese mathematicians of the wasan period, who named them &quot;kirei saijō suida&quot; (with modern kanji, 奇零 再乗 蓑深).

The same problem, formulated as one of counting the cannonballs in a square pyramid, was posed by Walter Raleigh to mathematician Thomas Harriot in the late 1500s, while both were on a sea voyage. The cannonball problem, asking whether there are any square pyramidal numbers that are also square numbers other than 1 and 4900, is said to have developed out of this exchange. Édouard Lucas found the 4900-ball pyramid with a square number of balls, and in making the cannonball problem more widely known, suggested that it was the only nontrivial solution. After incomplete proofs by Lucas and Claude-Séraphin Moret-Blanc, the first complete proof that no other such numbers exist was given by G. N. Watson in 1918.

==Formula==

If spheres are packed into square pyramids whose number of layers is 1, 2, 3, etc., then the square pyramidal numbers giving the numbers of spheres in each pyramid are:
These numbers can be calculated algebraically, as follows. If a pyramid of spheres is decomposed into its square layers with a square number of spheres in each, then the total number formula_2 of spheres can be counted as the sum of the number of spheres in each square, formula_3
and this summation can be solved to give a cubic polynomial, which can be written in several equivalent ways:
formula_4
This equation for a sum of squares is a special case of Faulhaber&#x27;s formula for sums of powers, and may be proved by mathematical induction.

More generally, figurate numbers count the numbers of geometric points arranged in regular patterns within certain shapes. The centers of the spheres in a pyramid of spheres form one of these patterns, but for many other types of figurate numbers it does not make sense to think of the points as being centers of spheres.
In modern mathematics, related problems of counting points in integer polyhedra are formalized by the Ehrhart polynomials. These differ from figurate numbers in that, for Ehrhart polynomials, the points are always arranged in an integer lattice rather than having an arrangement that is more carefully fitted to the shape in question, and the shape they fit into is a polyhedron with lattice points as its vertices. Specifically, the Ehrhart polynomial of an integer polyhedron is a polynomial that counts the integer points in a copy of that is expanded by multiplying all its coordinates by the number . The usual symmetric form of a square pyramid, with a unit square as its base, is not an integer polyhedron, because the topmost point of the pyramid, its apex, is not an integer point. Instead, the Ehrhart polynomial can be applied to an asymmetric square pyramid with a unit square base and an apex that can be any integer point one unit above the base plane. For this choice of , the Ehrhart polynomial of a pyramid is .

==Geometric enumeration==
As well as counting spheres in a pyramid, these numbers can be used to solve several other counting problems. For example, a common mathematical puzzle involves counting the squares in a large by square grid. This count can be derived as follows:
*The number of squares in the grid is .
*The number of squares in the grid is . These can be counted by counting all of the possible upper-left corners of squares.
*The number of squares in the grid is . These can be counted by counting all of the possible upper-left corners of squares.

It follows that the number of squares in an square grid is:
formula_5
That is, the solution to the puzzle is given by the -th square pyramidal number. The number of rectangles in a square grid is given by the squared triangular numbers.

The square pyramidal number formula_2 also counts the acute triangles formed from the vertices of a formula_7-sided regular polygon. For instance, an equilateral triangle contains only one acute triangle (itself), a regular pentagon has five acute golden triangles within it, a regular heptagon has 14 acute triangles of two shapes, etc. More abstractly, when permutations of the rows or columns of a matrix are considered as equivalent, the number of formula_8 matrices with non-negative integer coefficients summing to formula_1, for odd values of formula_1, is a square pyramidal number.

==Relations to other figurate numbers==
The cannonball problem asks for the sizes of pyramids of cannonballs that can also be spread out to form a square array, or equivalently, which numbers are both square and square pyramidal.
Besides 1, there is only one other number that has this property: 4900, which is both the 70th square number and the 24th square pyramidal number.

The square pyramidal numbers can be expressed as sums of binomial coefficients:
formula_11

The binomial coefficients occurring in this representation are tetrahedral numbers, and this formula expresses a square pyramidal number as the sum of two tetrahedral numbers in the same way as square numbers split into two consecutive triangular numbers.

If a tetrahedron is reflected across one of its faces, the two copies form a triangular bipyramid. The square pyramidal numbers are also the figurate numbers of the triangular bipyramids, and this formula can be interpreted as an equality between the square pyramidal numbers and the triangular bipyramidal numbers. Analogously, reflecting a square pyramid across its base produces an octahedron, from which it follows that each octahedral number is the sum of two consecutive square pyramidal numbers.

Square pyramidal numbers are also related to tetrahedral numbers in a different way: the points from four copies of the same square pyramid can be rearranged to form a single tetrahedron with twice as many points along each edge. That is,
formula_12

To see this, arrange each square pyramid so that each layer is directly above the previous layer, e.g. the heights are
Four of these can then be joined by the height pillar to make an even square pyramid, with layers formula_13.

Each layer is the sum of consecutive triangular numbers, i.e. formula_14, which, when totalled, sum to the tetrahedral number.

==Other properties==
The alternating series of unit fractions with the square pyramidal numbers as denominators is closely related to the Leibniz formula for, although it converges faster. It is:
formula_15

In approximation theory, the sequences of odd numbers, sums of odd numbers (square numbers), sums of square numbers (square pyramidal numbers), etc., form the coefficients in a method for converting Chebyshev approximations into polynomials.

<text>In the branch of mathematics known as topology, the specialization (or canonical) preorder is a natural preorder on the set of the points of a topological space. For most spaces that are considered in practice, namely for all those that satisfy the T0 separation axiom, this preorder is even a partial order (called the specialization order). On the other hand, for T1 spaces the order becomes trivial and is of little interest.

The specialization order is often considered in applications in computer science, where T0 spaces occur in denotational semantics. The specialization order is also important for identifying suitable topologies on partially ordered sets, as is done in order theory.

== Definition and motivation ==

Consider any topological space &quot;X&quot;. The specialization preorder ≤ on &quot;X&quot; relates two points of &quot;X&quot; when one lies in the closure of the other. However, various authors disagree on which &#x27;direction&#x27; the order should go. What is agreed is that if

:&quot;x&quot; is contained in cl{&quot;y&quot;},

(where cl{&quot;y&quot;} denotes the closure of the singleton set {&quot;y&quot;}, i.e. the intersection of all closed sets containing {&quot;y&quot;}), we say that &quot;x&quot; is a specialization of &quot;y&quot; and that &quot;y&quot; is a generalization of &quot;x&quot;; this is commonly written &quot;y ⤳ x&quot;.

Unfortunately, the property &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a specialization of &quot;y&quot; is alternatively written as &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and as &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; by various authors (see, respectively, and ).

Both definitions have intuitive justifications: in the case of the former, we have

:&quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if cl{&quot;x&quot;} ⊆ cl{&quot;y&quot;}.

However, in the case where our space &quot;X&quot; is the prime spectrum &quot;Spec R&quot; of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; (which is the motivational situation in applications related to algebraic geometry), then under our second definition of the order, we have

:&quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; if and only if &quot;y&quot; ⊆ &quot;x&quot; as prime ideals of the ring &quot;R&quot;.

For the sake of consistency, for the remainder of this article we will take the first definition, that &quot;x&quot; is a specialization of &quot;y&quot;&quot; be written as &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. We then see,

:&quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; is contained in all closed sets that contain &quot;y&quot;.
:&quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;y&quot; is contained in all open sets that contain &quot;x&quot;.

These restatements help to explain why one speaks of a &quot;specialization&quot;: &quot;y&quot; is more general than &quot;x&quot;, since it is contained in more open sets. This is particularly intuitive if one views closed sets as properties that a point &quot;x&quot; may or may not have. The more closed sets contain a point, the more properties the point has, and the more special it is. The usage is consistent with the classical logical notions of genus and species; and also with the traditional use of generic points in algebraic geometry, in which closed points are the most specific, while a generic point of a space is one contained in every nonempty open subset. Specialization as an idea is applied also in valuation theory.

The intuition of upper elements being more specific is typically found in domain theory, a branch of order theory that has ample applications in computer science.

== Upper and lower sets ==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space and let ≤ be the specialization preorder on &quot;X&quot;. Every open set is an upper set with respect to ≤ and every closed set is a lower set. The converses are not generally true. In fact, a topological space is an Alexandrov-discrete space if and only if every upper set is also open (or equivalently every lower set is also closed).

Let &quot;A&quot; be a subset of &quot;X&quot;. The smallest upper set containing &quot;A&quot; is denoted ↑&quot;A&quot;
and the smallest lower set containing &quot;A&quot; is denoted ↓&quot;A&quot;. In case &quot;A&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;} is a singleton one uses the notation ↑&quot;x&quot; and ↓&quot;x&quot;. For &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; one has:

*↑&quot;x&quot; = {&quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; : &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;} = ∩{open sets containing &quot;x&quot;}.
*↓&quot;x&quot; = {&quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; : &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;} = ∩{closed sets containing &quot;x&quot;} = cl{&quot;x&quot;}.

The lower set ↓&quot;x&quot; is always closed; however, the upper set ↑&quot;x&quot; need not be open or closed. The closed points of a topological space &quot;X&quot; are precisely the minimal elements of &quot;X&quot; with respect to ≤.

== Examples ==

* In the Sierpinski space {0,1} with open sets {∅, {1}, {0,1}} the specialization order is the natural one (0 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ 1, and 1 ≤ 1).
* If &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; are elements of Spec(&quot;R&quot;) (the spectrum of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;) then &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;q&quot; if and only if &quot;q&quot; ⊆ &quot;p&quot; (as prime ideals). Thus the closed points of Spec(&quot;R&quot;) are precisely the maximal ideals.

== Important properties ==

As suggested by the name, the specialization preorder is a preorder, i.e. it is reflexive and transitive.

The equivalence relation determined by the specialization preorder is just that of topological indistinguishability. That is, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are topologically indistinguishable if and only if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. Therefore, the antisymmetry of ≤ is precisely the T0 separation axiom: if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are indistinguishable then &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. In this case it is justified to speak of the specialization order.

On the other hand, the symmetry of the specialization preorder is equivalent to the R0 separation axiom: &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are topologically indistinguishable. It follows that if the underlying topology is T1, then the specialization order is discrete, i.e. one has &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. Hence, the specialization order is of little interest for T1 topologies, especially for all Hausdorff spaces.

Any continuous function formula_1 between two topological spaces is monotone with respect to the specialization preorders of these spaces: formula_2 implies formula_3 The converse, however, is not true in general. In the language of category theory, we then have a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of preordered sets that assigns a topological space its specialization preorder. This functor has a left adjoint, which places the Alexandrov topology on a preordered set.

There are spaces that are more specific than T0 spaces for which this order is interesting: the sober spaces. Their relationship to the specialization order is more subtle:

For any sober space &quot;X&quot; with specialization order ≤, we have
* (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) is a directed complete partial order, i.e. every directed subset &quot;S&quot; of (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) has a supremum sup &quot;S&quot;,
* for every directed subset &quot;S&quot; of (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) and every open set &quot;O&quot;, if sup &quot;S&quot; is in &quot;O&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; and &quot;O&quot; have non-empty intersection.

One may describe the second property by saying that open sets are &quot;inaccessible by directed suprema&quot;. A topology is order consistent with respect to a certain order ≤ if it induces ≤ as its specialization order and it has the above property of inaccessibility with respect to (existing) suprema of directed sets in ≤.

== Topologies on orders ==

The specialization order yields a tool to obtain a preorder from every topology. It is natural to ask for the converse too: Is every preorder obtained as a specialization preorder of some topology?

Indeed, the answer to this question is positive and there are in general many topologies on a set &quot;X&quot; that induce a given order ≤ as their specialization order. The Alexandroff topology of the order ≤ plays a special role: it is the finest topology that induces ≤. The other extreme, the coarsest topology that induces ≤, is the upper topology, the least topology within which all complements of sets ↓&quot;x&quot; (for some &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;) are open.

There are also interesting topologies in between these two extremes. The finest sober topology that is order consistent in the above sense for a given order ≤ is the Scott topology. The upper topology however is still the coarsest sober order-consistent topology. In fact, its open sets are even inaccessible by &quot;any&quot; suprema. Hence any sober space with specialization order ≤ is finer than the upper topology and coarser than the Scott topology. Yet, such a space may fail to exist, that is, there exist partial orders for which there is no sober order-consistent topology. Especially, the Scott topology is not necessarily sober.

<text>The Baikal teal (Sibirionetta formosa), also called the bimaculate duck or squawk duck, is a dabbling duck that breeds in eastern Russia and winters in East Asia.

== Taxonomy ==
The first formal description of the Baikal teal was by the German naturalist Johann Gottlieb Georgi in 1775 under the binomial name &quot;Anas formosa&quot;. A molecular phylogentic study published in 2009 found that the genus &quot;Anas&quot; as then defined was non-monophyletic. Based on this analysis the genus was split into four proposed genera with the Baikal teal placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Sibirionetta&quot; that had been introduced by the German zoologist Hans von Boetticher in 1929. The name &quot;Sibirionetta&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;sibiricus&quot; for Siberia and the Ancient Greek &quot;nētta&quot; for a duck. The specific epithet &quot;formosa&quot; is from the Latin &quot;formosus&quot; for &quot;beautiful&quot;.

== Description ==
At between , this duck is slightly larger and longer-tailed than the common teal. The breeding male is unmistakable, with a striking green nape, yellow and black auriculars, neck, and throat. It has a dark crown, and its breast is light brown with dark spots. Its grey sides are set off on the front and rear with white bars.

The Baikal teal has a height from 11.75 to 15.75 inches and a weighs an average of 1 pound.

The female looks similar to a female green-winged teal but with a longer tail, and a distinctive white spot at the base of the bill and a white throat that angles to the back of the eye. She also has a distinct light eyebrow bordered by a darker crown. The underwing is similar to the Green-winged Teal also, but has a darker leading edge. The green speculum has an indistinct cinnamon-buff inner border. Some &quot;females&quot; have &quot;bridle&quot; markings on their faces, but it has been suggested that at least some of these bridled &quot;females&quot;, if not all, are in fact juvenile males. The juvenile has a plumage similar to that of the female and can be distinguished from the Common Teal by the pale loral spot.

In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female, but plumage is a much richer reddish-brown (rufous) colour.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It breeds within the forest zone of eastern Siberia from the Yenisey basin eastwards to Kamchatka, northern Koryak, eastern Magadan Oblast, northern Khabarovsk Krai, southeastern and northern Sakha east central Irkutsk Oblast, and northern Krasnoyarsk Krai. It is a migratory species, wintering in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, northern and eastern China, from Beijing down the coast to the Vietnam border, and west to Yunnan then north to Chongqing and Henan.

It breeds in pools on the tundra edge and within swampy forests. In winter it is found on lowland fresh waters.

== Status ==
This species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, though it was classified as Vulnerable before 2011 due to hunting and destruction of its wintering wetland habitats. These threats remain, but the Baikal teal is recovering, with increased numbers of wintering birds and some increase in habitat area. Based on the numbers of Baikal teal counted wintering in South Korea, the global population is estimated to be around 1.07 million individual adults around 2010, a major increase from the tens of thousands counted in the 1980s and few hundreds of thousands in the 2000s.

<text>The Electoral Reform Society (ERS) is an independent advocacy organisation in the United Kingdom which promotes electoral reform. It seeks to replace first-past-the-post voting with proportional representation, advocating the single transferable vote, and an elected upper house of Parliament. It is the world&#x27;s oldest still-extant electoral reform campaign.

==Overview==

The Electoral Reform Society seeks a &quot;representative democracy fit for the 21st century.&quot; The society advocates the replacement of the first-past-the-post and plurality-at-large voting systems with a proportional voting system, the single transferable vote. First-past-the-post is currently used for elections to the House of Commons and for most local elections in England and Wales, while plurality-at-large is used in multi-member council wards in England and Wales, and was historically used in the multi-member parliamentary constituencies before their abolition.

It also campaigns for improvements to public elections and representative democracy, and is a regular commentator on all aspects of representation, public participation and democratic governance in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The ERS was founded in January 1884 as the Proportional Representation Society by the polymath and politician John Lubbock. By the end of the year, the society had attracted the support of 184 Members of Parliament, split almost equally between Conservatives and Liberals. Other early members included Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll), C. P. Scott, editor of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; and Thomas Hare, inventor of the Single Transferable Vote. The initial aim of the society was to have proportional representation included in the terms of the Representation of the People Act 1884 and the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. 23), but, despite a determined campaign of political lobbying, it was unable to do so.

A PRS pamphlet of the 1920s described the organisation&#x27;s aims thus:
:1. to reproduce the opinions of the electors in parliament and other public bodies in their true proportions
:2. to secure the majority of electors shall rule and all other considerable minorities shall be heard
:3. to give electors a wider freedom in the choice of representation
:4. to give representative greater independence by freeing them from the pressure of sectional interests (perhaps party discipline and back-room deals were meant)
:5. to ensure to parties representation by their ablest and most trusted members.

Alongside its sister organisation, Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, the society succeeded in getting STV introduced in local and then national elections in Ireland, and in numerous religious, educational and professional organisations. Following World War II, the society suffered from financial problems and a lack of public appetite for reform. When Fianna Fáil put to a referendum a proposal to revert to first-past-the-post voting twice (1959 and 1968), the society, under the leadership of Enid Lakeman, led a successful campaign to keep the STV system in Ireland.

In 1973, the STV was introduced in Northern Ireland for elections to local councils and to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, and the society and its staff were called upon to advise in the programme of education set up by the government to raise public awareness.

Interest in proportional representation revived sharply in Britain after the February 1974 general election. From then on, the society was able to secure a higher public profile for its campaigns. In 1983, the society was recognised by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organisation with consultative status.

==Activities==

The society has campaigned successfully for the introduction of STV for local elections in Scotland, and led the call for a referendum on the voting system in the wake of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal as part of the Vote for a Change campaign. It is a founding member of the Votes at 16 Coalition.

===AV referendum===

The society was later a principal funder of the YES! To Fairer Votes campaign in the unsuccessful bid for a Yes vote in the 2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote. Its chief executive, Katie Ghose, served as the campaign&#x27;s chair.

===Police and crime commissioners===

In 2012, the Society criticised Government handling of its policy of elected Police and crime commissioners – which led to the lowest turnout in British peacetime history.

In August 2012, the society predicted turnout could be as low as 18.5% and outlined steps to salvage the elections, mobilising support from both candidates and voters. The Government did not change tack, dubbing the prediction a &quot;silly season story&quot;. Following the result (in which the national turnout was a mere 15.1%, even lower than the society&#x27;s prediction), the Society branded the Government&#x27;s approach to elections as a &quot;comedy of errors&quot;, views that were reiterated by Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.

===Voter registration===

The society led bids to change the Government&#x27;s approach to introduction of Individual Electoral Registration, which the &quot;New Statesman&quot; dubbed &quot;the biggest political scandal you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;. Electoral Commission sources estimated as many as 10 million voters could disappear from the electoral roll under government plans, predominantly poor, young or black, and more liable to vote Labour. The society succeeded in securing changes to the legislation.

===European Union===
In a 2014 report, the society recommended several ways to make the European Union more accountable and argued that there was a democratic deficit. These included: better scrutiny of EU legislation by the British parliament, a voting system which gives voters more influence over individual candidates (e.g. single transferable vote) and recruitment of party candidates with a wider ranges of views on the EU.

===Analysis of 2016 EU referendum===
In August 2016, the society published a highly critical report on the referendum and called for a review of how future events are run. Contrasting it very unfavourably with the &#x27;well-informed grassroots&#x27; campaign for Scottish independence, ERS Chief Executive Katie Ghose described it as &quot;dire&quot; with “glaring democratic deficiencies” which left voters bewildered. Katie Ghose noted a generally negative response to establishment figures with 29% of voters saying David Cameron (a Remain supporter) made them more likely to vote leave, whilst only 14% said he made them want to vote remain. Looking ahead, the society called for an official organisation to highlight misleading claims and for Ofcom to define the role that broadcasters are expected to play.

=== 2018 gender analysis ===

In February 2018, the ERS reported that hundreds of seats were being effectively &#x27;reserved&#x27; by men, holding back women&#x27;s representation. Their report states that 170 seats are being held by men first elected in 2005 or before – with few opportunities for women to take those seats or selections.

=== Labour for a New Democracy ===
In September 2020, the Electoral Reform Society joined with other pressure groups (including Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform) and Labour MPs to launch &quot;Labour for a New Democracy&quot;, a campaign to &quot;build support for UK electoral reform in Labour with the aim of changing party policy by the time its next conference takes place&quot;. According to polling, three-quarters of Labour members believe the party should commit to supporting proportional representation and adopt it as a policy. The motion for the September 2021 Labour Party conference was defeated despite 80% of CLP delegates voting in favour, due to an overwhelming vote against by the affiliated trade unions, most of which at the time did not have policy on electoral reform. In October 2021, the trade union Unite changed its policy to back proportional representation.

In June 2022, the trade union Unison also voted to support proportional representation. Other unions that have declared their support for proportional representation include the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), the Musicians&#x27; Union (MU) and the Transport Salaried Staffs&#x27; Association (TSSA). Politicians from all wings of the Labour Party have come out in support of proportional representation, including the former leader of Welsh Labour and former First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford when he was in office.

At the Labour Party Conference in September 2022, delegates from CLPs and trade unions voted overwhelmingly in favour of adopting proportional representation. The motion is not binding on the party leadership but does commit the party to include PR in its election manifesto. Although during his leadership campaign, Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, said: &quot;I also think on electoral reform, we’ve got to address the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and they feel their vote doesn’t count. That’s got to be addressed.&quot; It has subsequently been reported that he has always opposed proportional representation.

* Electoral Reform Services Limited (ERS, formerly Electoral Reform Ballot Services): a company established by the Electoral Reform Society in 1988 to provide an independent balloting and polling service to organisations conducting elections and polls. The service is widely used by trade unions, political parties, building societies and companies when balloting their members or shareholders in ways defined by the law and their internal management. In many cases, these organisations are forbidden from conducting their ballots internally in an attempt to ensure that the ballots are conducted impartially. Until 2018 the Electoral Reform Society remained a minority shareholder and was in large part financed by its dividend from Electoral Reform Services. In 2018 Electoral Reform Services was sold out to Civica, becoming Civica Election Services thereby losing its integrity. The majority of the Electoral Reform Society&#x27;s income is now financed by a capital fund set up with the proceeds from this sale.

<text>Schafik Jorge Hándal Hándal (; October 14, 1930 – January 24, 2006) was a Salvadoran politician.
==Biography==
Born in Usulután, he was the son of Palestinian immigrants from the town of Bethlehem.

Between 1973 and 1994, he was the general secretary of the Communist Party of El Salvador (PCES). As General Secretary of the PCES, Hándal embraced elections and rejected armed struggle to conquer political power in El Salvador. Later on, after two allegedly fraudulent elections in 1972 and in 1977, and despite the intervention of the Communist Party of Cuba (History of the FMLN, newspaper &quot;Frente&quot;), Handal became convinced that the defeat of the military dictatorship would not be possible through elections. As a guerrilla leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a member of the group that brought five opposition forces together to found the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) movement.

Following the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992, the FMLN converted itself from a guerrilla army into a political party, and Hándal served as its general coordinator. In 1997, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly, serving as the leader of the FMLN&#x27;s party bloc in the legislature.

=== 2004 presidential elections ===
He was the FMLN&#x27;s candidate in El Salvador&#x27;s 2004 presidential election, held on March 21, running on a leftist platform that called for a friendly relationship with the United States (according to his own pamphlet for the campaign), renegotiation of free trade treaties and a closer relationship with socialist-oriented countries in Latin America, including Cuba, Venezuela and more liberal Brazil. Opponents accused Handal of exploiting anti-American sentiment while FMLN supporters accused the United States of corrupting the electoral process, because several high-ranking U.S. officials stated that American relations with El Salvador would be seriously threatened if Handal won the elections. Hándal was defeated by the candidate of the ruling conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), Antonio Saca, who was also of Palestinian descent, by a margin of 58 percent to 36 percent. The election saw a turnout of 70 percent at the polls.

== Death ==
Hándal died less than two years after his failed presidential bid, on January 24, 2006, of a heart attack. He fainted at Comalapa Airport upon his return from Bolivia where he had attended the inauguration ceremony of President Evo Morales; he was flown by helicopter to a San Salvador hospital but doctors were unable to revive him.

== Awards and honors ==
In a ceremony held at the Universidad de El Salvador on January 16, 2004, he received the honorary title of Professor of Political Science from the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

Posthumously, he was declared &quot;Meritorious Son of the City of San Salvador&quot; by the Mayor of San Salvador Carlos Rivas Zamora, and deputies of the PARLACEN granted him an acknowledgement of &quot;Central American Merit Honor&quot;. The Permanent Commission of Political Parties of Latin America (COPPPAL) induced him posthumously with the order &quot;Luis Donaldo Colosio&quot;. In this connection, it should also be mentioned that on 27 January 2006, the General University Assembly of the University of El Salvador agreed to propose to the Higher University Council of that same university that the &quot;Doctorate Honoris Causa Post Mortem&quot; be awarded to Schafik Hándal, who approved that recommendation on 6 April 2006. 69 The posthumous awarding ceremony of this honorary title, together with a medal of honor, took place on September 19, 2006, at the Cine Teatro of that educational center, being received by Jorge Schafik Hándal Vega, son of Schafik Hándal, from the hands of Dr. María Isabel Rodríguez, who at that time was the rector of that institution of higher education.

The auxiliary Catholic bishop of San Salvador, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chávez, said that Hándal was the greatest politician of the country in the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century. The President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was one of the Latin American leaders who most grieved over the death of Hándal, who considered him a great revolutionary.

<doc id="542375" wikidata="Q6953740" url="?curid=542375" title="NFL Primetime">
<text>NFL Primetime is a sports television program that has aired on ESPN since 1987. The show is presented similarly to ESPN&#x27;s own &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, featuring scores, highlights, and analysis of every game of the week in the NFL.

When it debuted in 1987, the show aired every Sunday night during the NFL season. When NBC acquired the rights for Sunday night games beginning in the 2006, NBC also negotiated for exclusive rights for extended highlights during its &quot;Football Night in America&quot; pregame show, causing ESPN to begin airing &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; on Mondays. In 2019, the program was moved to ESPN+.

==Original format (1987–2005)==
Until the 2006 season, &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; aired every Sunday night during the NFL season and it preceded ESPN&#x27;s coverage of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; (it even aired when ESPN did not have a Sunday night game, especially from 1990 to 1997 when TNT had Sunday night games the first half of the season). The show was hosted by Chris Berman, with analysis from Tom Jackson. Berman and Jackson recapped Sunday afternoon&#x27;s NFL games with highlights, statistics, and commentary.

Pete Axthelm was a regular from 1987 until his death in 1991. Through the show&#x27;s history, other co-hosts included John Saunders, Robin Roberts, Bill Pidto, and Stuart Scott. Pidto was often the target of good-natured ribbing by Berman, since Pidto often did recaps of games featuring losing teams. Roberts also seemed to be assigned to recap almost every game the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played between 1990 and 1992, when the Bucs were fielding some of the worst teams in NFL history. The position of co-host was dropped prior to the start of the 1998 season.

During the first three rounds of the playoffs, a half-hour edition of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; would air after the competition of each night&#x27;s games. A guest analyst typically joined Jackson on the panel, while a co-host was deemed unnecessary since Berman would only need to recap only two games on those nights. An extended edition of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; would then air after each Super Bowl at the game&#x27;s site, serving as ESPN&#x27;s postgame show with player interviews.

===Presentation===
Rather than provide the usual package of scoring highlights, &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; presented extended highlights which also showed less dramatic plays. This provided context for the greater depth of analysis of each game. A common non-dramatic play that would be shown would be a game-clinching first down while a team was running out the clock. Some of the less dramatic plays would be used to demonstrate an overall large accomplishment. During the highlights for the Chicago Bears-San Francisco 49ers matchup in 2000, when Terrell Owens broke an NFL record by catching 20 passes in a game (since broken by Brandon Marshall), all 20 of Owens&#x27;s receptions were shown. Other examples involved seemingly unsuccessful plays ultimately benefitting a team. For the highlights of the Buccaneers-Miami Dolphins game in 2000, a contest marred by heavy rains which came down to the final minute, a play where Bucs running back Warrick Dunn broke a tackle in his own end zone to avoid a safety was shown to demonstrate it as one of the biggest plays contributing to the Bucs&#x27;s victory.

The show began with Berman welcoming viewers and then giving a quick rundown of the late games before beginning the highlights of the early games. They were generally shown in a relatively chronological order, with the 1:00 games shown first and the 4:00/4:15 games shown near the end of the program. However, on some occasions (particularly in Week 17 when teams would be making their final push for the playoffs), the highlights would be presented less chronologically. For Week 17 games, the highlights would instead be sorted by conference, with teams competing against each other for a playoff spot or a division title shown back-to-back. Probably the show&#x27;s most notable occurrence with this scenario came in Week 17 of the 1999 season, when the Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers tied in overall record, division record, conference record, and common opponent record, meaning that a spot involving the two teams would come down to point differential. As a result, both teams ran up the score against their opponents in their final games in order to try to outscore the other team in the race. For this scenario, the Arizona Cardinals-Packers and the New Orleans Saints-Panthers highlights were shown simultaneously, with scoring by the teams in both games shown chronologically while a graphic would be shown featuring which team was leading at the time based on point differential. When ESPN aired the Sunday Night game, the broadcast usually featured a preview of that game. Later airings of NFL Primetime featured a SportsCenter highlight of that game.

Starting in 2003, a game with either high stakes for both teams or an exciting finish (typically a 1:00 game) would be chosen by Berman, Jackson, and their staff as that week&#x27;s &quot;Prime Cut.&quot; This game would be shown in the middle of the program with an extended lead-in by Berman. Also in 2003, a segment entitled &quot;T.J.&#x27;s Extra Point&quot; was introduced, where Jackson would demonstrate greater analysis over a strategy a team used to great success. At the end of the show, a segment entitled &quot;Primetime Players&quot; would feature both Berman and Jackson choosing a player or team unit that particularly impressed them from that week&#x27;s games. At the turn of the millennium, a fan vote for that week&#x27;s primetime player would also be conducted for the show on ESPN&#x27;s website.

===Music===
A staple of the show was the various FirstCom Music instrumental pieces that played in the background during the highlights, while Berman and Jackson recapped each game. This often gave the games, even in highlight form, a more epic feel overall. This feature continues during highlights on &quot;The Blitz&quot;.

For the most part, highlights from the show would feature FirstCom Music scores over the highlights. Some songs were even played on a consistent basis for certain teams. The Buffalo Bills, for example, often had their game played out (regardless of outcome) to a dramatic piece entitled &quot;Powersurge,&quot; featuring triumphant passages of brass instruments. The Oakland Raiders, meanwhile, were often represented by an ominous-sounding piece called &quot;Bad Company,&quot; that featured extensive use of minor-key strings, horns, and keyboards. Other songs were commonly used for certain situations. &quot;International Statement,&quot; an epic-sounding song complete with a climactic build-up of low brass and strings that was arguably NFL Primetime&#x27;s signature song, was often used for a high-stakes game, while &quot;Grid-Lock,&quot; a lighter song featuring a more subdued introductory horn riff and an extended guitar solo (unusual for a song utilized in the program), was utilized for relatively unexciting games involving teams at the bottom of the standings.

On rare occasions, however, the standard FirstCom Music themes would be replaced by other music themes. For the Raiders-Pittsburgh Steelers matchup in 2000, which marked their last meeting at Three Rivers Stadium as well as the stadium&#x27;s second to last game, the music was replaced by classic NFL Films themes by Sam Spence including &quot;A Golden Boy Again&quot; and &quot;The Raiders,&quot; while Berman confused then-current Raiders and Steelers with legendary ones. A similar example involved the San Diego Chargers-St. Louis Rams matchup earlier in 2000, when the music was replaced by the William Tell Overture to underscore the Rams as the &quot;Greatest Show on Turf&quot; (with the music subsequently muted when the Chargers were shown making a good play). On other occasions, non-standard music themes would interrupt the themes being played on the highlights. For the Washington Redskins&#x27; final game at RFK Stadium in 1996, a 36–10 win over the Dallas Cowboys, the music was briefly replaced by their fight song &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot; before returning to the previous standard theme for the final stats. In 2000, when the Baltimore Ravens scored a touchdown after having failed to score one in their previous five games, the music was briefly interrupted with celebratory music before returning to the standard FirstCom theme for the remainder of the highlights.

Finally, music was occasionally altered on the program, particularly in situations involving injured players. On some occasions where a serious injury or other tragic event occurred, the music would be played at a noticeably softer volume than usual, or would be muted entirely until the highlight resumed. After then-Indianapolis Colts head coach Tony Dungy&#x27;s son James committed suicide in 2005, the highlights for the Colts&#x27;s first game after his death began with silence while tributes taking place during the game were shown, with the music only playing for the actual game itself.

==Move on Monday (2006–2018)==
When NBC acquired the rights for Sunday night games beginning in the 2006 season, NBC negotiated for exclusive rights for extended highlights during its &quot;Football Night in America&quot; pregame show. ESPN responded by moving the show to Mondays and splitting the program into two versions. &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; would then return to its old format during the playoffs, still airing on ESPN after the competition of each night&#x27;s games.

===Early showing===
Originally, the first version aired two-and-a-half hours before ESPN&#x27;s telecast of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, normally 6p.m. Eastern Time. It was hosted by Stuart Scott along with analysts Ron Jaworski and Mike Ditka and aired from the site of the Monday night game preceding &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;. (The program broadcast from a parking lot set, in contrast to &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;, which takes place inside the stadium. When the package began with two Monday night games on September 11, 2006, &quot;Primetime&quot; aired from McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, California, while &quot;Countdown&quot; originated at FedExField in Landover, Maryland).

Due to low ratings (partially due to the repositioning of what was a Sunday evening staple), this early edition of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; was relocated to the ESPN studios in Bristol, Connecticut every other week starting October 16.

In 2007, this show gained a new time slot, 4p.m. ET, switching with &quot;SportsCenter Monday Kickoff&quot;, all programs were moved to the Bristol studio, and the second version&#x27;s hosts (see below) were also assigned to the earlier show. Scott was sent to a new remote set used by &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;.

===Late showing===
The second version airs ninety minutes after &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; ends, and it originates from the ESPN studios. This edition is hosted by the &quot;NFL Live&quot; team of Trey Wingo and analysts Merril Hoge, and occasionally Mark Schlereth or Mike Ditka. In 2008, Trent Dilfer joined as an analyst. In 2011, Tim Hasselbeck replaced Dilfer. This is the only version of the show to actually be in primetime, albeit only on the West Coast at 10:00 p.m. PT or slightly later. This version re-airs Tuesday afternoons at 2:00 p.m. ET.

Both versions show highlights, but for a shorter period of time than on the older program and with more extended analysis segments. The highlights on the current incarnation of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; tend to be more story driven, emphasizing key player performances or game storylines as opposed to a normal recap that is found on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Both shows are presented by Miller Lite.

On December 24, 2011, during week 16 of the 2011 NFL season, ESPN aired &quot;Primetime&quot; in its classic timeslot and format, with Berman and Jackson recapping the action. This was due to the weekend&#x27;s NFL games being played on Saturday of that weekend, and with the NBC contract running for Sundays only, ESPN its first original &quot;Primetime&quot; in 6 years.

==&quot;The Blitz&quot; (2006–2016)==
Following the re-tooling of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot;, Chris Berman and Tom Jackson were given an extended segment of the Sunday night edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (11 p.m. ET) called &quot;The Blitz&quot;. The segment follows the same structure as the original version of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot;, featuring Berman and Jackson using the same player nicknames, catch phrases, and back-and-forth banter as the original show.

On January 8, 2007, Chris Berman and Tom Jackson returned to &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; to present highlights of the 2006 NFL Playoffs games between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots and the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles, and they remained for the entire postseason that followed.

ESPN has not used the NFL name or logo in the official segment name or in advertising, leading to unconfirmed rumors of not being given permission to do so by the league. In 2007, however, on-screen graphics surrounding the set has referred to both &quot;The Blitz&quot; and &quot;NFL Blitz.&quot;

Nike sponsored the segments in both years in 2006 and &#x27;07; it was replaced by Old Spice in 2008.

==Early &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (2008–2016)==
In 2008, an extended version of &quot;The Blitz&quot; has aired as part of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from 7 to 8 or 8:15 p.m. ET. The hosts are Berman, Jackson, Saunders and Trent Dilfer. In addition to highlights, the network has extended additional game statistics, standings, and leaderboards on the right-hand portion of the screen. It is in direct competition to &quot;Football Night in America&quot;, although it is believed that &quot;FNIA&quot; still has the official advantage in percentage of the show devoted to highlights. Coincidentally, the revamp of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; came after NBC hired Dan Patrick to team with Keith Olbermann on &quot;FNIA&quot; highlights; Patrick and Olbermann were the premier anchor team on that show in the 1990s.

==&quot;NFL Primetime&quot; on ESPN+ (2019–present) ==
On September 13, 2019, ESPN announced that Berman and Jackson would return for a new digital-only edition of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot;, streaming weekly throughout the NFL season on ESPN+ beginning on September 15, 2019 (in time for Week 2 highlights). The program streams live at 7:30p.m. ET on Sundays during the regular season and is updated with highlights for the Sunday and Monday night games upon their completion. Playoff editions of &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; also stream on ESPN+ after the competition of each night&#x27;s games; conference championship round and Super Bowl editions are also simulcast on ESPN.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 Jackson opted out of the program. He was replaced by Booger McFarland; this change subsequently became permanent.

As for ESPN itself, this show was replaced with a new program, &quot;NFL Rewind&quot; (also hosted by Wingo with Tim Hasselbeck and former NFL head coach John Fox as analysts), which follows the same format as &quot;NFL Primetime&quot;.
