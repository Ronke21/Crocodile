<text>&quot;For the British colonial administrator, see Alexander Frederick Whyte&quot;

Rev Alexander Whyte D.D.,LL.D. (13 January 18366 January 1921) was a Scottish divine. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1898.

==Life==
He was born in Kirriemuir, Forfarshire to Janet Thomson, an unmarried girl. Janet declined to marry Alexander&#x27;s father, John Whyte, who thereafter went to America. She did however give Alexander his father&#x27;s surname.
His mother joined the Free Church of Scotland at the Disruption of 1843. In 1848 he began an apprenticeship as a cobbler. In 1854 he took on a role as schoolteacher at Padanaram in Forfar and the following year moved to teach in Airlie. In Airlie the local minister taught him Latin and Greek, enabling him to apply for university

He studied divinity at the University of Aberdeen and then at New College, Edinburgh graduating in 1866. This was in part funded by his estranged father. His half-sister, Elizabeth Whyte, came to join him from America to help him keep house. There she met his colleague, Rev Thomas Macadam, whom she married.

Whyte entered the ministry of the Free Church of Scotland and after serving as colleague in Free St John&#x27;s, Glasgow (1866–1870), removed to Edinburgh as colleague and successor to Rev Dr Robert Candlish at Free St George&#x27;s. In 1909 he succeeded Dr Marcus Dods as principal, and professor of New Testament literature, at New College, Edinburgh.

He was an active educator and author and published widely on subjects ranging from John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; to St. Teresa of Avila, John Law, and Jakob Böhme. He was also an ecumenicist, maintaining a cordial correspondence with Cardinal Newman and publishing a selection of his work. He became a member of the general committee of the recently established Edinburgh Social Union in 1885.

Whyte lived in a huge townhouse 7 Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh&#x27;s First New Town. The house is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and open to the public as &quot;The Georgian House, Edinburgh&quot;.

He retired from the ministry of Free St George&#x27;s in 1916, and from his position as principal of New College in 1918. He lived in Buckinghamshire from around 1915 and died there. However he was returned to Edinburgh for burial. He is buried near the north-west corner of the first northern extension to Dean Cemetery.

A memorial to Whyte in St George&#x27;s Free Church in Edinburgh was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.

==Family==

In 1881 he was married to Jane Elizabeth Barbour (1861-1944). Their son Robert Barbour Whyte was killed in the First World War. Their eldest son (Alexander) Frederick Whyte was a journalist and politician who received a knighthood. Their daughter Janet Chance was a feminist author and campaigner for sex education, birth control, and access to abortion.

==Honours==

In December 1909, the Town Council of Edinburgh awarded him Freedom of the City.

<doc id="554656" wikidata="Q3140459" url="?curid=554656" title="Horace Jones (architect)">
<text>Sir Horace Jones (20 May 1819 – 21 May 1887) was an English architect particularly noted for his work as architect and surveyor to the City of London from 1864 until his death. He served as president of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1882 until 1884, and was knighted in 1886. His most recognised work, Tower Bridge, was completed posthumously. Although his work is widely recognised, Jones himself is relatively little known, and is often disparaged by the architectural profession because of a perceived lack of artistry.

==Biography==
The son of David Jones, a lawyer, and Sarah Lydia Shephard, Jones was born at 15 Size Lane, Bucklersbury, London. He was articled to John Wallen, an architect and surveyor, of 16 Aldermanbury, and subsequently in 1841–42 travelled to Italy and Greece studying ancient architecture.

In 1843 he commenced practice as an architect at 16 Furnival&#x27;s Inn, Holborn. Beginning with Cardiff Town Hall (c. 1850–53) and Caversham Park (from c. 1850), he designed and carried out many important buildings, soon coming to concentrate on work in London. He was surveyor for the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s Tufnell Park estate, for the Barnard estate, and the Bethnal Green estate.

On 26 February 1864 he was elected architect and surveyor to the City of London, succeeding James Bunstone Bunning. Jones completed projects begun by his predecessor, such as the City Lunatic Asylum at Dartford, and was in charge of several renovations and additions to the Guildhall. He designed and built some of London&#x27;s most famous markets, in particular Smithfield, Billingsgate and Leadenhall.
He also designed the memorial at Temple Bar, replacing Wren&#x27;s arch which was a notorious traffic obstacle. Jones also claimed that the chosen design for Holborn Viaduct was his , though he later lost a piracy case against William Haywood, Engineer to the City of London, who is now credited with the work.

Jones&#x27; final legacy is one of the most recognised buildings in the world, Tower Bridge. It was designed in collaboration with the civil engineer John Wolfe Barry, who was brought in as an expert to devise the mechanism for the bascule bridge. Following Jones&#x27; death during the initial stages of construction, the execution lay in the hands of Barry.

Jones became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1842, a fellow in 1855. Despite his prominence in the profession, he was voted down for the Presidency in 1881 on the grounds that his work did not show sufficient artistry, and that he was a local authority employee rather than an independent practitioner. Jones protested strongly and was elected President at the next election in 1882. He was knighted on 30 July 1886. Jones was also a freemason, and from 1882 until his death was Grand Superintendent of Works in which capacity he oversaw the rebuilding of the Freemasons Hall in Covent Garden after it was destroyed by fire in 1883.

Jones married Ann Elizabeth Patch, the daughter of John Patch, a barrister, on 15 April 1875 and had one daughter, Annie Horatia (1876-1969). He died at 30 Devonshire Place, Portland Place, London, on 21 May 1887, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery on 27 May. A portrait of Jones by Walter William Ouless RA was exhibited at the Royal Academy Exhibition in 1887.

<text>Michael Angelo Pergolesi () was an Italian decorative artist from the 18th century who worked mainly in England.

==Biography==
Biographical details are almost entirely lacking, but like Cipriani he was brought, or attracted, to England by Robert Adam after his famous continental tour. He worked so extensively for the Adams&#x27;, and his designs are so closely typical of much upon which their reputation rests, that it is impossible to doubt his influence upon their style. His range, like theirs, was catholic. He designed furniture, mantelpieces, ceilings, chandeliers, doors and mural ornament with equal felicity, and as an artist in plaster work in low relief he was unapproached in his day.

He delighted in urns and sphinxes and interlaced gryphons, in amorini with bows and torches, in trophies of musical instruments and martial weapons, and in flowering arabesques which were always graceful if sometimes rather thin. The centre panels of his walls and ceilings were often occupied by classical and pastoral subjects painted by Cipriani, Angelica Kauffman or her husband Antonio Zucchi, and sometimes by himself. These nymphs and amorini, with their disengaged and riant air and classic grace, were not infrequently used as copies for painting upon that satinwood furniture of the last quarter of the 18th century which has never been surpassed for dainty elegance, and for the popularity of which Pergolesi was in large measure responsible; they were even reproduced in marquetry.

Some of this painted work was, apparently, executed by his own hand; most of the pieces attributed to him are remarkable examples of artistic taste and technical skill. His satinwood table-tops, china cabinets and side-tables are the last word in a daintiness which here and there perhaps is mere prettiness.

Pergolesi likewise designed silver plate, and many of his patterns are almost instinctively attributed to the brothers Adam by the makers and purchasers of modern reproductions. There is, moreover, reason to believe that he aided the Adam firm in purely architectural work. In later life Pergolesi appears, like Angelica Kauffman, to have returned to Italy.

Pergolesi wrote &quot;Designs for Various Ornaments on Seventy Plates&quot;, published between 1777 and 1801.

<doc id="554661" wikidata="Q5450849" url="?curid=554661" title="Finnish numerals">
<text>Numbers in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are highly systematic, but can be irregular.

== Cardinal numbers ==
The ordinary counting numbers (cardinals) from 0 to 10 are given in the table below. Cardinal numbers may be inflected and some of the inflected forms are irregular in form.

Note: in parentheses, alternative form for counting, and colloquial. The dialectic-colloquial forms may leave the &quot;d&quot; off and sometimes also the genitive ending &quot;n&quot;: ; ; ; ; ; . (Corresponding the formal and ordinary counting in Estonian.)

=== Teens and multiples of ten ===
To form teens, is added to the base number. is the partitive form of , meaning &quot;second group of ten&quot;. Hyphens are written here to separate morphemes. In Finnish text, hyphens are not written.
:one-second., two-second., … nine-second.
:&quot;one of the second, two of the second, … nine of the second&quot;
:11, 12, … 19

In older Finnish, all numbers were constructed like this. This usage is now considered archaic and the suffix is treated as a particle instead of meaning &quot;of the second&quot;.
: two-ten., one-third., two-third., … nine-third.
: &quot;two tens, one of the third, two of the third, … nine of the third&quot;
: 20, 21, 22, … 29
: one-fourth., one-fifth.
: &quot;one of the fourth, one of the fifth&quot;
: 31, 41

Even older forms included at the end, giving for example &quot;one of the second decade&quot; for 11 and &quot;five of the third decade&quot; for 25.

The numbers for tens (20, 30, up to 90) are constructed this way:
: two-ten., three-ten., four-ten., … nine-ten.
: &quot;two tens, three tens, four tens, … nine tens&quot;
: 20, 30, 40, 90

In modern Finnish, the numbers 21–29, 31–39, and so on are constructed as in English:
: two-ten. one, two-ten. two, two-ten. three
: &quot;two tens one, two tens two, two tens three&quot;
: 21, 22, 23

=== Hundreds ===
100 is , 200 is and so on.

1000 is , 2000 is and so on.

So, 3721 is (actually written as one long word with no dashes in between).

=== Years ===
In older Finnish, years were expressed by counting centuries. Use of this convention is archaic. For instance, &quot;1922&quot;, instead of the modern .

Long numbers (like 32534756) are separated in three-digit sections with spaces beginning from the end of the number (for example 32 534 756). Writing it with letters follows the same spacing, with one additional rule: in numbers over one million, &quot;million&quot; is written separately. The preceding example is written . (No dashes. They are only to make the number look clear.)

=== Inflection ===
Numbers can be inflected by case; all parts of the number except are inflected.

Nouns following a number in the nominative singular are usually in the singular partitive case, if the noun does not need to be in any other case and if the number is any number other than &quot;one&quot;.

If the number is &quot;one&quot; and it is in the nominative singular then the noun and any adjectives following it will also be in the singular nominative.

But if the noun is in a case besides the nominative, the number and any adjectives following it will be in the same case. For example:

=== Sets ===
Numerals also have plural forms, which usually refer to things naturally occurring in pairs or other similarly well-defined sets, such as body parts and clothing items. Also names of celebrations are usually in the plural. The plural forms are inflected in cases in the same way as the corresponding nouns. For instance:

=== Etymology ===
Numbers from one to seven are apparently original in etymology. The words &quot;eight&quot; and &quot;nine&quot; have no confirmed etymology. The old theory is that they are compounds: * &quot;10–2&quot;, or &quot;eight&quot; and * &quot;10–1&quot;, or &quot;nine&quot;, where the reconstructed word is similar to the Indo-European words for &quot;ten&quot; (*dek´m), but this is phonologically not plausible. Alternatively, they could be * and &quot;itself, without two&quot; and &quot;without one&quot;, where is a form of &quot;no&quot; inflected with the Karelian reflexive conjugation (&quot;itself, without two&quot;).

== Ordinal numbers ==
These are the &#x27;ordering&#x27; form of the numbers: &quot;first, second, third&quot;, and so on. Ordinal numbers are generally formed by adding an &quot;-s&quot; ending, but &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; are completely different, and for the others the stems are not straightforward:

For teens, the first part of the word is changed; however, the words for &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; lose their irregularity in &quot;eleven&quot; and &quot;twelve&quot;:

For twenty through ninety-nine, all parts of the number get the &#x27;-s&#x27; ending. &#x27;First&#x27; and &#x27;second&#x27; take the irregular form only at the end of a word. The regular forms are possible for them but they are less common.

100th is , 1000th is , 3721st is . Again, dashes only included here for clarity; the word is properly spelled without them.

Like cardinals, ordinal numbers can also be inflected:

The in the &#x27;teens&#x27; is actually the partitive of , which is why gets no further inflection endings. (Literally || one-of-the-second&#x27;.)

Long ordinal numbers in Finnish are typed in almost the same way as the long cardinal numbers. 32534756 would be (in numbers over one million, &quot;million&quot; is written separately) . (Still, no dashes.)

== Names of numbers ==
This is a feature of Finnish which does not have an exact counterpart in English (with the curious exceptions of calling a five-dollar bill a &quot;fiver&quot; and 9 &quot;niner&quot; in radio communication), but there is a counterpart in colloquial German, for example: &quot;7er, 190er, 205er&quot;. These forms are used to refer to the actual number itself, rather than the quantity or order which the number represents. This should be clearer from the examples below, but first here is the list:

Also, refers to the shape of the number. Some examples of how these are used:

: The &#x27;number three tram&#x27; is the — when you are riding it, you are riding with 
: A magazine has the title &quot;7&quot; and is called 
: My car, a &#x27;93 model, is an when buying spare parts
: If the car is a 190E Mercedes, it would be a .
: If a car has tires in size of 205, they would be called ( &quot;a set of-&quot;)&quot;two hundred fives&quot; or ( &quot;a number of-&quot;)&quot;two hundred fives&quot;. Also ( &quot;a set of-&quot;)&quot;two zero fives&quot; or ( &quot;a number of-&quot;)&quot;two zero fives&quot;.
: The &quot;106&quot; bus is the 
: A 5€ bill may be called , a 10€ bill (in plural: /), a 20€ , a 100€ bill , etc.
== Numbers in the spoken language ==
In spoken Finnish the final &quot;i&quot; in , as well as the final &quot;a&quot; in the numbers 11-19, is frequently dropped. Other short forms can be heard for the tens, where the element can be heard as &quot;kyt&quot;: shortened words like (30), (40), (50), (60), (70), (80), (90) are not uncommon. When counting a list of items a kind of spoken shorthand can be heard. Thus, may become or even , but the forms can vary from person to person.

<doc id="554664" wikidata="Q1329463" url="?curid=554664" title="Quiksilver">
<text>Quiksilver is a brand of surf-inspired apparel and accessories that was founded in 1969 in Torquay, Victoria, but is now based in Huntington Beach, California. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest brands of surfwear and boardsport-related equipment. The parent company changed its name in March 2017 from Quiksilver, Inc. to Boardriders, Inc., and is the owner of the brands Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes. In 2018, Boardriders acquired Billabong International Limited, gaining the Billabong, Element, Von Zipper, RVCA and XCEL brands. Authentic Brands Group bought Boardriders and its associated brands and intellectual property in 2023.

Quiksilver manufactures and sells a wide range of products that include sportswear (swimsuits), clothing (T-shirts, polo shirts, flannels, jackets, hoodies, pants, shorts), footwear (sneakers, sandals), and accessories (hats, backpacks, and wallets). The company also produces a line of apparel for young women, under the Roxy brand. Another line of apparel for women is sold under the brand Quiksilver Women.

==Recent corporate history==
Quiksilver purchased Skis Rossignol for $560 million in 2005, but sold Rossignol on 12 November 2008 for $37.5 million (30 million euros) in cash and a $12.5 million note (10 million euro). Quiksilver owned golf-equipment maker Cleveland Golf until 31 October 2007, when it sold the company to a Japanese sporting-goods company.

In 2009, Moody&#x27;s included Quiksilver on its Bottom Rung list of companies most likely to default on its debt.

As of 2013, Quiksilver operated 834 stand-alone stores in major cities across Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific, Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa]. At that time, the two types of Quiksilver-operated stores were known as either &quot;Boardriders Club&quot; or &quot;Factory&quot; stores. Their products were also sold in many other outlets across the world, such as PacSun, the Fells Point Surf Company, and the Ron Jon Surf Shop. With PacSun&#x27;s decline in retail prominence, Quiksilver and other brands suffered diminished sales. In addition, the company operated a number of separate Roxy and Quiksilver Youth stores.

As of 2013, the company suffered a financial slump for six years and initiated a turnaround plan in an attempt to resolve this. In September 2015, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Co-founder of Quiksilver Bob McKnight stepped down as CEO on 11 January 2013. He then acted as executive chairman, until retiring in October 2014. Andy Mooney, who was formerly chairman of Disney Consumer Products, was CEO from 2013 to 2015.

Mooney stepped down as the CEO and was replaced in March 2015 by longtime employee Pierre Agnes to restructure the brand. In 2015, Agnes was promoted from president to CEO.

Quiksilver emerged from bankruptcy in early 2016, and the company once again became privately held, with Oaktree Capital Management as the majority shareholder. By the end of 2016, their retail presence had significantly diminished after restructuring by Oaktree.

The company&#x27;s name was changed in March 2017 to Boardriders, Inc., and it is the owner of the Quiksilver, Roxy, and DC Shoes brands. Boardriders purchased Billabong International Limited in 2018.

On 30 January 2018, the global CEO of Boardriders, Pierre Agnes, was declared missing after his powerboat washed ashore without him near Biarritz, France, after he radioed in to delay his return in thick fog conditions. A search operation by air and sea was launched the same day. The search was called off a few days later, as he was declared lost at sea and presumed dead. Dave Tanner, the company&#x27;s former chief turnaround officer, became CEO on 6 February 2018.

Boardriders, Inc. owns Quiksilver, Roxy, DC Shoes, Billabong, Element, Von Zipper, RVCA, and XCEL.

In April 2023, Authentic Brands Group made a binding offer to acquire Boardriders, Inc. for US$1.25 billion.

On February 2, 2025, Liberated Brands, owner of Quiksilver and Roxy retail stores in the US, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. The company announced the closure of all remaining Quiksilver and Roxy locations in the US, with liquidation sales beginning a week before the bankruptcy.

==Roxy==
In 1990, Quiksilver launched its sister brand for young women, Roxy. The brand was shuttered after the 1991 surf industry crash, but revived by Bob McKnight and Danny Kwock in 1992, signing Lisa Andersen in 1993. It was differentiated from the main Quiksilver line &quot;for fear it would damage the men&#x27;s brand&quot;, according to Randy Hild, the company&#x27;s senior vice president of marketing. Roxy was chosen because it sounded like a punk band or club (likely Roxy Music and The Roxy respectively), and is also the name of the daughters of both CEO Bob McKnight and founder Alan Green. About 30% of Quiksilver&#x27;s sales come from the Roxy line.

Since inception, Roxy has grown to be the largest action sport fashion apparel company for young women. In addition to apparel, it now also produces accessories, homewares, hard goods (snow and surf), wetsuits, footwear, and books. It has sub-brands for its children&#x27;s ranges, Roxy Girl and Teenie Wahine.

In the spring of 2013, the &quot;DVF loves Roxy&quot; collection was released as a one-time limited-edition collaboration line of swim and beach wear as well as accessories.

== Brand image ==
The Quiksilver brand&#x27;s logo, designed in 1973 by founders Alan Green and John Law, was inspired by Japanese painter Hokusai&#x27;s woodcut, &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;. It depicts a large wave with a mountain on a red background. Roxy&#x27;s heart-shaped logo was created by duplicating and reflecting the Quiksilver logo and rotating both copies at a 45-degree angle.

== Controversy ==
In 2023, a news article from Beach Grit reported that Quiksilver directly copied a design from a small company, Ola Canvas, and their Blackball boardshorts. Quiksilver posted the design on their Instagram account on February 14, 2023 and Ola Canvas posted a response five days later.

<text>In economics, average cost (AC) or unit cost is equal to total cost (TC) divided by the number of units of a good produced (the output Q):

formula_1

Average cost is an important factor in determining how businesses will choose to price their products.

==Short-run average cost==

Short-run costs are those that vary with almost no time lagging. Labor cost and the cost of raw materials are short-run costs, but physical capital is not.

An average cost curve can be plotted with cost on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. Marginal costs are often also shown on these graphs, with marginal cost representing the cost of the last unit produced at each point; marginal costs in the short run are the slope of the variable cost curve (and hence the first derivative of variable cost).

A typical average cost curve has a U-shape, because fixed costs are all incurred before any production takes place and marginal costs are typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity. In this &quot;typical&quot; case, for low levels of production marginal costs are below average costs, so average costs are decreasing as quantity increases. An increasing marginal cost curve intersects a U-shaped average cost curve at the latter&#x27;s minimum, after which the average cost curve begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal cost is above average costs, so average costs are increasing as quantity increases. For example: for a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period—below a certain production level, average cost is higher due to under-used equipment, and above that level, production bottlenecks increase average cost.

==Long-run average cost==

Long-run average cost is the unit cost of producing a certain output when all inputs, even physical capital, are variable. The behavioral assumption is that the firm will choose that combination of inputs that produce the desired quantity at the lowest possible cost.

A long-run average cost curve is typically downward sloping at relatively low levels of output, and upward or downward sloping at relatively high levels of output. Most commonly, the long-run average cost curve is U-shaped, by definition reflecting economies of scale where negatively sloped and diseconomies of scale where positively sloped.

If the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale (i.e., is operating in a downward sloping region of the long-run average cost curve) if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, the latter being exclusively a feature of the production function. Likewise, it has diseconomies of scale (is operating in an upward sloping region of the long-run average cost curve) if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale. With perfect competition in the output market the long-run market equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).

If, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified. For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input&#x27;s per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.

In some industries, long-run average cost is always declining (economies of scale exist indefinitely). This means that the largest firm tends to have a cost advantage, and the industry tends naturally to become a monopoly, and hence is called a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies tend to exist in industries with high capital costs in relation to variable costs, such as water supply and electricity supply.

== Relationship to marginal cost ==

When average cost is declining as output increases, marginal cost is less than average cost. When average cost is rising, marginal cost is greater than average cost. When average cost is neither rising nor falling (at a minimum or maximum), marginal cost equals average cost.

Other special cases for average cost and marginal cost appear frequently:
* Constant marginal cost/high fixed costs: each additional unit of production is produced at constant additional expense per unit. The average cost curve slopes down continuously, approaching marginal cost. An example is hydroelectric generation, which has no fuel expense, limited maintenance expenses and a high up-front fixed cost (ignoring irregular maintenance costs or useful lifespan). Industries with fixed marginal costs, such as electrical transmission networks, may meet the conditions for a natural monopoly, because once capacity is built, the marginal cost to the incumbent of serving an additional customer is always lower than the average cost for a potential competitor. The high fixed capital costs are a barrier to entry.
* Two popular pricing mechanisms are average cost pricing (or rate of return regulation) and marginal cost pricing. A monopoly produces where its average cost curve meets the market demand curve under average cost pricing, referred to as the average cost pricing equilibrium. 
* Minimum efficient scale: Marginal or average costs may be nonlinear, or have discontinuities. Average cost curves may therefore only be shown over a limited scale of production for a given technology. For example, a nuclear plant would be extremely inefficient (high average cost) for production in small quantities. Similarly, its maximum output for any given time period may essentially be fixed, and production above that level may be technically impossible, dangerous or extremely costly. The long run elasticity of supply are higher, as new plants could be built and brought on-line.
* Zero fixed costs (long-run analysis) and constant marginal cost: since there are no economies of scale, average cost is equal to the constant marginal cost.

== Relationship between AC, AFC, AVC and MC ==
1. The Average Fixed Cost curve (AFC) starts from a height and goes on declining continuously as production increases.

2. The Average Variable Cost curve, Average Cost curve and the Marginal Cost curve start from a height, reach the minimum points, then rise sharply and continuously.

3. The Average Fixed Cost curve approaches zero asymptotically. The Average Variable Cost curve is never parallel to or as high as the Average Cost curve due to the existence of positive Average Fixed Costs at all levels of production; but the Average Variable Cost curve asymptotically approaches the Average Cost curve from below.

4. The Marginal Cost curve always passes through the minimum points of the Average Variable Cost and Average Cost curves, though the Average Variable Cost curve attains the minimum point prior to that of the Average Cost curve.

<text>Jane Arminda Delano (March 12, 1862 in Montour Falls, New York – April 15, 1919 in Savenay, Loire-Atlantique, France) was a nurse and founder of the American Red Cross Nursing Service.

==Personal life==
A descendant of one of the first settlers to America, Philippe de la Noye (Delano) (1602–1681) Jane Delano attended Cook Academy, a Baptist boarding school in her hometown then studied nursing at the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing in New York City, where she graduated in 1886.

==Professional life==
Delano started work in 1888 at a Jacksonville, Florida, hospital treating victims of a yellow fever epidemic. There, she demonstrated her superior executive and administrative skills and developed innovative nursing procedures for the patients under her care. Leaving Florida, Jane Delano then spent three years nursing typhoid patients at a copper mine in Bisbee, Arizona until accepting an appointment as the Superintendent of Nurses at University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Jane Delano became a member of the New York Chapter of the American Red Cross and served as the secretary for the enrollment of nurses. In 1902 she returned to Bellevue Hospital in New York City as the director of the Training School for Nurses where she remained until 1909 when she was made Superintendent of the United States Army Nurse Corps. During this time, her invaluable contributions to her profession resulted in her being named president of the American Nurses Association and chair of the National Committee of the Red Cross Nursing Service.

A leading pioneer of the modern nursing profession, Delano almost single-handedly created American Red Cross Nursing when she united the work of the American Nurses Association, the Army Nurse Corps, and the American Red Cross. Through her efforts, emergency response teams were organized for disaster relief and over 8,000 registered nurses were trained and ready for duty by the time the United States entered World War I. During the course of the War, more than 20,000 of her nurses played vital roles with the United States military. For her contributions during the war she was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Secretary of the Army.

==Death==
Jane Delano died in France while on a Red Cross mission, expiring at Base Hospital No. 8 in Savenay of Loire-Inferieure, and was interred in a cemetery in the Loire Valley. The mission was to participate in and represent the American Red Cross at the preliminary conference of Red Cross workers and health experts of the world being held at Cannes. Awarded the Distinguished Service Medal posthumously, following her 1919 death her remains were brought back to the United States by the Army Quartermaster Corps and re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery. At the top of the hill overlooking the nurses section is a bronze memorial to Jane Delano and the 296 nurses who lost their lives during World War I. Military funeral services, prior to burial, were held Saturday, September 18, 1920. A number of representatives of the American Red Cross, Army officers of the Army Medical Corps, and a delegation of uniformed nurses attended the funeral. A detachment of Army troops and a military band from Fort Myers acted as an escort for the body when it was taken to the grave from the vault at Arlington Cemetery. All present stood silent as &quot;taps&quot; was given over the grave of Miss Delano.

Delano has been honored many times for her dedication to humanity. She was named to the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame and at Schuyler County Hospital in Dix, New York there is a Jane Delano Memorial with a display of personal items including a number of her awards and medals. In 1990, the National Nursing Advisory Committee formed the &quot;Jane Delano Society&quot; to ensure active nursing involvement at all levels of the Red Cross and to preserve artifacts that document the history of Red Cross nursing.

<text>Robert Smith Candlish (23 March 1806 – 19 October 1873) was a Scottish minister who was a leading figure in the Disruption of 1843. He served for many years in both St. George&#x27;s Church and St George&#x27;s Free Church on Charlotte Square in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town.

==Life==
He was born at 11 West Richmond Street in Edinburgh, the son of James Candlish (originally McCandlish, 1759-1806), a lecturer in medicine and friend of Robert Burns. James died soon after Robert was born. He and his siblings were raised by his mother, Jane Smith (1768–1854). She moved to Glasgow soon after her husband&#x27;s death and survived by running a boarding house at 49 Virginia Street.

In 1820, he began studying divinity at Glasgow University, where he graduated in 1823. During the years 1823–1826, he went through the prescribed course at the divinity hall, then presided over by Rev. Dr Stevenson McGill. On leaving, he accompanied a pupil as private tutor to Eton College, where he stayed two years.

In 1829, Candlish entered upon his life&#x27;s work, having been licensed to preach during the summer vacation of the previous year. After short assistant pastorates at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Glasgow, and then the parish church of Bonhill in Dunbartonshire, he became assistant minister to Rev. James Martin of St George&#x27;s, Edinburgh. He attracted the attention of his audience by his intellectual keenness, emotional fervour, spiritual insight, and power of dramatic representation of character and life. His theology was that of the Scottish Calvinistic school, and he gathered round him one of the largest congregations in the city.

In 1840, he was living at 9 Randolph Crescent in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End, a huge terraced townhouse.

Candlish took an interest in ecclesiastical questions, and he soon became involved in the struggle which was then agitating the Church of Scotland. His first Assembly speech, delivered in 1839, placed him among the leaders of the party that afterwards formed the Free Church, and his influence in bringing about the Disruption of 1843 was inferior only to that of Thomas Chalmers. He took his stand on two principles: the right of the people to choose their ministers, and the independence of the church in things spiritual. On his advice, Hugh Miller was appointed editor of the &quot;Witness&quot; and Miller wrote much of the weekly copy.

Following the Disruption, Candlish was one of the Free Churchmen who spoke in England, explaining the reason why so many had left the Established Church.
He was actively engaged at one time or other in nearly all the various schemes of the church, but particularly the education committee, of which he was convener from 1846 to 1863, and in the unsuccessful negotiations for union among the non-established Presbyterian denominations of Scotland, which were carried on during the years 1863–1873. Candlish was the Free Church Moderator at the Assembly of 1867. He was succeeded in 1868 by Rev. William Nixon.

In 1841, the government nominated Candlish to the newly founded chair of Biblical criticism in the University of Edinburgh. However, owing to the opposition of Lord Aberdeen, the presentation was cancelled. In 1847 Candlish, who had received the degree of D.D. from Princeton, New Jersey, in 1841, was chosen by the Assembly of the Free Church to succeed Chalmers in the chair of divinity in the New College, Edinburgh. After partially fulfilling the duties of the office for one session, he was led to resume the charge of St George&#x27;s, the clergyman who had been chosen by the congregation as his successor having died before entering on his work.

In 1851, he established a Gaelic Church on Cambridge Street. In 1862, he succeeded William Cunningham as principal of New College with the understanding that he should still retain his position as minister of St George&#x27;s.

==Death==
Candlish died at home, 52 Melville Street in Edinburgh in 1873.

As the Free Church lost the right to burial in the traditional parish burial grounds, Candlish is buried in the non-denominational Old Calton Burial Ground. He lies in the southern extension, just south-east of the Martyr&#x27;s Monument.

==Family==

He married 6 January 1835, Jessie (died 16 September 1894), daughter of Walter Brock and Janet Crawford, and had issue —
*James Smith Candlish, D.D., minister at Logie-Almond and Aberdeen, Professor in Free Church College, Glasgow, 1872–97, born 14 December 1835, died 7 March 1897
*Jessie, born 14 January 1837, died 29 January 1893 (married 1865, William Anderson of Glentarkie)

Several of their children died in childhood.

==Works==
Candlish made a number of contributions to theological literature. In 1842 he published the first volume of his &quot;Contributions towards the Exposition of the Book of Genesis&quot;, a work which was completed in three volumes several years later. In 1854 he delivered, in Exeter Hall, London, a lecture on the &quot;Theological Essays of the Rev. F. D. Maurice&quot;, which he afterwards published, along with a fuller examination of the doctrine of the essays. In this he defended the forensic aspect of the gospel. A treatise entitled &quot;The Atonement; its Reality, Completeness and Extent&quot; (1861) was based upon a smaller work which first appeared in 1845. In 1864 he delivered the first series of Cunningham lectures, taking for his subject &quot;The Fatherhood of God&quot;. Published immediately afterwards, the lectures excited considerable discussion on account of the peculiar views they represented. Further illustrations of these views were given in two works published about the same time as the lectures, one a treatise &quot;On the Sonship and Brotherhood of Believers&quot;, and the other an exposition of the first epistle of St John.

<text>Mahmuei () is a village in Shakhenat Rural District of Shakhenat District, Birjand County, South Khorasan province, Iran.

According to legend, the first settlers named the village &quot;Mahmûeî&quot; because it was on open and flat ground. The word &quot;mahmuei&quot; is a derivation of the word &quot;mahmah&quot; which according to the Dehkhoda Dictionary means a flat plain.

==History==
There is a shrine in the village cemetery where a pious man known as Âqâye Mîr-Abbâss, a descendant of Muhammad (&quot;Seyyed&quot;), was buried 70 years ago. The natives respect the shrine and dedicate money to it for obtaining their wants. About 1920s, at the time of making grape syrup (&quot;shîre-ye angoor&quot;) via boiling grape juice, somebody said to him &quot;you are not a descendant of The Prophet.&quot; Mîr-Abbâss became annoyed and stepped into the huge fire that was lighted for boiling grape juices. He sat in the midst of the fireplace (Golkhan) to prove miraculously that he was a descendant of Muhammad. He stayed in the fireplace for a while and did not go out till some villagers entreated him to go out. After that event, the villagers believed and respected him and built a monument on his grave.

Since 1950, many people emigrated from Mahmuei to city areas, especially to Tehran and Mashad. Many of these emigrants gather in the village during Muharram when a ceremony of Ta&#x27;zieh (&quot;Shabîh-khânî&quot;) is performed.

==Demographics==
===Language and religion===
The inhabitants are Shiite Muslims speaking a local dialect of Persian.

===Population===
Official statistics for Mahmuei in 1996 estimated a population of 695 people (185 houses and 223 families). At the time of the 2006 National Census, the village&#x27;s population was 726 in 243 households, when it was in the Central District. The following census in 2011 counted 860 people in 238 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the village as 750 people in 221 households. It was the most populous village in its rural district.

After the census, the rural district was separated from the district in the formation of Shakhenat District.

==Overview==
Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Major products of Mahmuei are saffron (&quot;Za`ferân&quot;) and barberry (&quot;Zereshk&quot;) that are cultivated for exporting. Beet and wheat are cultivated as well. Grapes, black plume, apricots, melons, watermelons, almonds and pistachios are produced for local use. Before 1950, opium was also cultivated. Prior to digging the first deep well about 1980s, dry farming was the only agricultural method. Today, in addition to a string of underground aqueducts (&quot;Qanât&quot;), there are two networks of piped water and 23 electric and diesel deep wells for field irrigation.

Modern facilities include an electricity network since 1986, health-care, telephone (just one line since 1996,tel: +98 056 2533 -3400), drinking water since 1998, unrefined piped water, asphalt roads, a rural cooperative, an Islamic council, elementary school and a boarding middle school.

<doc id="554671" wikidata="Q17088227" url="?curid=554671" title="Density estimation">
<text>In statistics, probability density estimation or simply density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function. The unobservable density function is thought of as the density according to which a large population is distributed; the data are usually thought of as a random sample from that population.

A variety of approaches to density estimation are used, including Parzen windows and a range of data clustering techniques, including vector quantization. The most basic form of density estimation is a rescaled histogram.

== Example ==


We will consider records of the incidence of diabetes. The following is quoted verbatim from the data set description:

:&quot;A population of women who were at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage and living near Phoenix, Arizona, was tested for diabetes mellitus according to World Health Organization criteria. The data were collected by the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. We used the 532 complete records.&quot;

In this example, we construct three density estimates for &quot;glu&quot; (plasma glucose concentration), one conditional on the presence of diabetes,
the second conditional on the absence of diabetes, and the third not conditional on diabetes.
The conditional density estimates are then used to construct the probability of diabetes conditional on &quot;glu&quot;.

The &quot;glu&quot; data were obtained from the MASS package of the R programming language. Within R, codice_1 and codice_2 give a fuller account of the data.

The mean of &quot;glu&quot; in the diabetes cases is 143.1 and the standard deviation is 31.26.
The mean of &quot;glu&quot; in the non-diabetes cases is 110.0 and the standard deviation is 24.29.
From this we see that, in this data set, diabetes cases are associated with greater levels of &quot;glu&quot;.
This will be made clearer by plots of the estimated density functions.

The first figure shows density estimates of &quot;p&quot;(glu | diabetes=1), &quot;p&quot;(glu | diabetes=0), and &quot;p&quot;(glu).
The density estimates are kernel density estimates using a Gaussian kernel. That is, a Gaussian density function is placed at each data point, and the sum of the density functions is computed over the range of the data.

From the density of &quot;glu&quot; conditional on diabetes, we can obtain the probability of diabetes conditional on &quot;glu&quot; via Bayes&#x27; rule. For brevity, &quot;diabetes&quot; is abbreviated &quot;db.&quot; in this formula.

:formula_1

The second figure shows the estimated posterior probability &quot;p&quot;(diabetes=1 | glu). From these data, it appears that an increased level of &quot;glu&quot; is associated with diabetes.

== Application and purpose ==
A very natural use of density estimates is in the informal investigation of the properties of a given set of data. Density estimates can give a valuable indication of such features as skewness and multimodality in the data. In some cases they will yield conclusions that may then be regarded as self-evidently true, while in others all they will do is to point the way to further analysis and/or data collection.

An important aspect of statistics is often the presentation of data back to the client in order to provide explanation and illustration of conclusions that may possibly have been obtained by other means. Density estimates are ideal for this purpose, for the simple reason that they are fairly easily comprehensible to non-mathematicians.

More examples illustrating the use of density estimates for exploratory and presentational purposes, including the important case of bivariate data.

Density estimation is also frequently used in anomaly detection or novelty detection: if an observation lies in a very low-density region, it is likely to be an anomaly or a novelty.

* In hydrology the histogram and estimated density function of rainfall and river discharge data, analysed with a probability distribution, are used to gain insight in their behaviour and frequency of occurrence. An example is shown in the blue figure.

<text>Robert Rainy (1 January 1826 – 22 December 1906), was a Scottish Presbyterian divine. Rainy Hall in New College, Edinburgh (the Divinity faculty at Edinburgh University) is named after him.

==Life==
He was born on New Year&#x27;s Day 1826 at 28 Montrose Street in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Dr. Harry Rainy LLD (1792–1876) a surgeon who later served as Professor of Forensic Medicine in the University of Glasgow, and his wife Barbara Gordon (1793–1854). The family lived at 28 Montrose Street. One of his uncles was George Rainy, the noted slave plantation owner and personality involved in the Highland Clearances.

Robert initially studied Medicine at Glasgow University to follow his father&#x27;s career. However his interests turned to the church, which had been the path of his grandfather, Rev George Rainy (1734–1810) of Sutherland, in northern Scotland. He was caught by the evangelical fervour of the Disruption of 1843, and moved to Edinburgh to train as Free Church minister at New College.

He was ordained by the Free Church at Huntly in Aberdeenshire in 1851 and then in 1854 moved to the Free High Church in Edinburgh (occupying the north-east section of New College). In 1862 he was elected Professor of Church History in the same college. In 1874 he was made Principal of the college in succession to Robert Candlish, and was subsequently known as Principal Rainy. At this time he lived at 8 Rosebery Crescent in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End.

He had come to the front as a champion of the Liberal Party in the Union controversy within the Free Church, and in combating Dean Stanley&#x27;s Broad Church views in the interests of Scotch evangelicism.

From 1875 he became one of the leading figures of the Free Church. He guided it through the controversies as to Robertson Smith&#x27;s heresies, as to the use of hymns and instrumental music (a large part of the church preferring unaccompanied singing), and also to the Declaratory Act. In this he was one of the figures who brought to a successful conclusion the union of the Free Church of Scotland and United Presbyterian Churches, and threw the weight of the newly united church on the side of freedom of Biblical criticism.

He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1887 in succession to Rev Alexander Neill Somerville and was succeeded in turn by Rev John Laird in 1888. Following the Union of 1900 he left the Free Church of Scotland to join as leader of the United Free Church of Scotland serving as its first Moderator.

Though not a great scholar he was eminent as an ecclesiastical statesman, and his influence was far-reaching. After the strain of the fight with the so-called Wee Frees in 1904-5 his health broke down.

In his final years he was living at 8 Rosebery Crescent in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End. However, he went on a trip to Australia to recover his health and died in Melbourne on 22 December 1906.

His body was returned to Scotland and he is buried against the southern wall of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. His wife, Susan Rolland (1835–1905) and most of his children (including Adam Rainy MP and Rev Henry Craigie Rainy) lie with him. His monument is nearly identical to that of the brewer John McEwan, slightly to the east of Rainy.

==Publications==

*&quot;Delivery and Development of Christian Doctrine&quot;, Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1874 (Cunningham Lectures)
*&quot;The Bible and Criticism&quot;
*&quot;Three Lectures on the Church of Scotland&quot;
*&quot;Expository Commentary on Philippians&quot;
*&quot;Life of Principal Cunningham&quot;

==Family==

In 1857 he married Susan Rolland, daughter of Adam Rolland of Gask.

Their children included the politician Adam Rolland Rainy and the Indian civilian Sir George Rainy.

His granddaughter, Barbara Parker, inspired her youngest child, Andrew Parker, to follow in his footsteps. Andrew studied Divinity at New College and went on to become a published biblical scholar.

==Legacy==

The main secular assembly space within New College is now called Rainy Hall. It was used as a dining hall for the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s student halls of residence at Mylne&#x27;s Court and Patrick Geddes Hall until they became self-catering. However, it is still used as a dining hall by New College students and by Commissioners attending the annual General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Rainy Hall is also available to hire through The University of Edinburgh.

<doc id="554688" wikidata="Q1286094" url="?curid=554688" title="Edmund C. Lynch">
<text>Edmund Calvert Lynch (May 19, 1885 – May 12, 1938) and his friend, Charles E. Merrill, formed Merrill Lynch on October 15, 1915.

==Early years==

Of Irish descent, Edmund Lynch was born on May 19, 1885, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Richard H. Lynch and Jennie Vernon Smith Lynch. Edmund Calvert Lynch attended the Boys&#x27; Latin School of Maryland in Baltimore and graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1907.

==Merrill and Lynch==

Edmund Lynch met Charles E. Merrill when Lynch was a stockbroker on Wall Street. In 1907, Merrill moved into Lynch&#x27;s room at the YMCA&#x27;s boarding house while trying to find a place to live in New York City. The two men shared their ideas of starting a brokerage, and became great friends. On October 15, 1914, Charles E. Merrill and Lynch started Merrill Lynch.

Lynch was especially known for helping create, finance, and broker many large chain-stores in the United States, including S.S. Kresge Corporation (now Kmart), J. C. Penney, and Safeway Inc.

Lynch also purchased the pioneering French movie company Pathé Exchange in 1921, and later rebranded it to Keith-Orpheum (RKO Pictures).

== Predicting the 1929 Stock Market Crash ==
Edmund C. Lynch gained special notoriety when he foresaw the impending Wall Street crash of 1929, and advised Merrill Lynch&#x27;s clients to sell many of their stock holdings in 1928. As many Americans were enjoying the soaring stock market in 1928, Lynch was convinced a disaster was near. His famous letter to all of Merrill Lynch&#x27;s clients warned:Now is the time to get out of debt. We think you should know that with a few exceptions all the larger companies financed by us today have no funded debt. This is not the result of luck but of carefully considered plans on the part of their managements and ourselves to place these companies in an impregnable position. The advice that we have given important corporations can be followed to advantage by all classes of investors. We do not urge you to sell securities indiscriminately, but we advise you in no uncertain terms that you take advantage of present high prices and put your own financial house in order. We recommend that you sell enough securities to lighten your obligations, or better yet, pay them entirely.Lynch&#x27;s concern for the bullish stock market was so strong that he went to the White House in 1928 and warned President Calvin Coolidge of his intuition. During his meeting with the President, Lynch famously even offered to make President Coolidge a partner of his firm, but the President turned down his offer.

When later asked of his incredible foresight in 1933, Lynch told the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;The lesson that I had learned--when stocks are too high they come down--stood me in good stead in 1928-29.&quot;

It is estimated that Lynch&#x27;s intuition saved his clients over $83 million (approx. $1.3B adjusted for inflation).

==Personal life==
Edmund Lynch married Signa Janney Fornaris in 1923 with whom he had three children: Vernon, Edmund Calvert Jr. (who later joined his father&#x27;s firm), and Signa Janney. Vernon married Robert G. Merrill, whose father was Joseph Merrill. Vernon and Robert had six children: Lynn Gray, Gail Merrill, Edmund Merrill, Douglas Merrill, Signa Hermann, and Nina Merrill. They also have nine grandchildren: Kelli Merrill, Austen (Baron) Gray, Dustin Merrill, Lily Gray, Nick Merrill, Merrill Hermann, Taylor Ogan, Robert Hermann III, and Chase Merrill.

==Death and legacy==

He died in London, England while on business, on May 12, 1938.

Upon his death, he bequeathed $59,000 to Johns Hopkins medical school in the name of his brother.

<doc id="554691" wikidata="Q316792" url="?curid=554691" title="A. S. Neill">
<text>Alexander Sutherland Neill (17 October 1883 – 23 September 1973) was a Scottish educator and author known for his school, Summerhill, and its philosophy of freedom from adult coercion and community self-governance. Raised in Scotland, Neill taught at several schools before attending the University of Edinburgh in 1908–1912. He took two jobs in journalism before World War I, and taught at Gretna Green Village School in the second year of the war, writing his first book, &quot;A Dominie&#x27;s Log&quot; (1915), as a diary of his life there as head teacher. He joined a Dresden school in 1921 and founded Summerhill on returning to England in 1924. Summerhill gained renown in the 1930s and then in the 1960s–1970s, due to progressive and counter-culture interest. Neill wrote 20 books. His top seller was the 1960 &quot;Summerhill&quot;, read widely in the free school movement from the 1960s.

==Early life and career==
Alexander Sutherland Neill was born in Forfar, Scotland, on 17 October 1883 to George Neill and Mary (&quot;née&quot; Sutherland Sinclair). He was their fourth son; one of the eight surviving children out of 13. He was raised in an austere, Calvinist house with values of fear, guilt, and adult and divine authority, which he later repudiated. As a child, he was obedient, quiet, and uninterested in school. His father was the village dominie (Scottish schoolmaster) of Kingsmuir, near Forfar in eastern Scotland, and his mother had been a teacher before her marriage. The village dominie held a position of prestige, hierarchically beneath that of upper classes, doctors, and clergymen. As typical of Scottish methods at the time, the dominie controlled overcrowded classrooms with his tawse, as corporal punishment. Neill feared his father, though he later claimed his father&#x27;s imagination as a role model for good teaching. Scholars have interpreted Neill&#x27;s harsh childhood as the impetus for his later philosophy, though his father was not shown to be harsher to Allie (as Neill was known) than to anyone else. Neill&#x27;s mother insisted on high standards for her family, and demanded comportment to set the family apart from the townspeople.

Children usually left the local school for Forfar Academy at the age of 14, and with his father a teacher, Neill was especially expected to do so. Instead of wasting time and money, Neill went to work as a junior clerk in an Edinburgh gas meter factory. His parents took pity on his hatred of the job, homesickness, and its low pay, and so Neill became an apprentice draper in Forfar. He found the work stultifying and came home after a foot inflammation. Neill tried to take an examination that would raise his pay grade, but could not bring himself to study. Now 15, his parents decided to make him his father&#x27;s assistant &quot;pupil teacher&quot;. The children liked Neill, though he received poor marks from a school inspector. He taught a wider range of topics as his self-confidence grew, and he developed an interest in mathematics from the Forfar Academy maths master. After four years, he tried for teacher training college, but came nearly last in his class. He continued as a pupil teacher in Bonnyrigg and Kingskettle, where he found the teachers&#x27; instruction militant and loathsome. He stayed in Kingskettle for three years, during which he learned Greek from a local priest, an experience that increased his interest in academicism and sublimated his interest in priesthood into a desire to attend university. After studying with the priest and the Forfar math master, Neill passed his university entrance exam and preliminary teacher&#x27;s certification.

Neill became an assistant teacher at the Newport Public School in the wealthy Newport-on-Tay, where he learned to dance and appreciate music and theatre. He also fell in love, and Margaret became an obsession of his. He adopted progressive techniques at this school, and abandoned the tawse for other forms of establishing discipline. Neill was friendly and relaxed with his pupils, and described his two years there as &quot;the happiest of [his] life thus far&quot;. He finished his university entrance exams and received his full teaching certification.

In 1908, at the age of 25, Neill enrolled in the University of Edinburgh. He began as an agriculture student, at his father&#x27;s behest for a well-salaried career, but switched to English literature by the end of his first year. Neill was excluded from cultural events due to his lack of funds, but participated in sports, showed interest in the military, and wrote for &quot;The Student&quot; (the university magazine) and the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;. He became the student paper&#x27;s editor during his last year, which opened Neill to a world of culture. He also felt more confident to pursue women. In his editorials, Neill criticized the tedium of lectures and the emphasis on tests instead of critical thinking. He began to develop his thoughts about the futility of forced education, and the axiom that all learning came from intrinsic interest. Neill graduated in 1912 and began to edit encyclopedias and similar reference books. He took a new job as art editor of the &quot;Piccadilly Magazine&quot;, but its operations were halted by the 1914 onset of World War I, in which he served as an officer in the army. He returned to Scotland, working as a head teacher at Gretna Green School during the first year of the war. The diary he wrote for this year was published as a book, &quot;A Dominie&#x27;s Log&quot;, in November 1915 by Herbert Jenkins, and received good reviews for its humour and narrative style.

Neill was invited to join a progressive school in Dresden in 1921. The school moved to a monastery near Vienna in 1923, where the townspeople did not receive it well. He moved to England in 1924 and started Summerhill in Lyme Regis, where the name came from the estate.

==Summerhill School==

The school picked up some notoriety and the average enrolment was 40 pupils. In 1927, it moved to Leiston, where it remained.

Neill credited Summerhill&#x27;s environment instead of himself for the school&#x27;s reformatory successes. Neill used to offer psychoanalytic therapy (&quot;private lessons&quot;, since he was not a licensed therapist) for children who arrived as delinquents from other institutions, but later found love, affirmation and freedom to be better cures.

The Summerhill classroom was popularly assumed to reflect Neill&#x27;s anti-authoritarian beliefs, though their classes were traditional in practice. Neill did not show outward interest in classroom pedagogy, and was mainly interested in student happiness. He did not consider lesson quality important, and thus there were no distinctive Summerhillian classroom methods. Leonard Waks wrote that, like Homer Lane, Neill thought all teaching should follow student interest, and that teaching method did not matter much once student interest was apparent. In a review of an algebra lesson taught by Neill as recounted through Herb Snitzer&#x27;s &quot;Living at Summerhill&quot;, Richard Bailey described Neill&#x27;s teaching technique as &quot;simply awful&quot; for his lack of student engagement, inarticulate explanations, and insults directed at students. Bailey criticized Neill&#x27;s absolution of responsibility for his pupils&#x27; academic performance, and his view that charismatic instruction was a form of persuasion that weakened child autonomy. Ronald Swartz referred to Neill&#x27;s method as Socratic, about which Bailey disagreed.

Neill was not religious. Despite this, he would flippantly remark that Summerhill was the only Christian school in England when its philosophy was compared with that of Christ. Neill saw the doctrine of &quot;original sin&quot; as a means of control and sought a world ruled by love and self-examination. Like Freud, he felt that children who were denied understanding of their sexuality in their youth became adults who were similarly fearful of their own sexuality.

==Philosophy==

Neill felt that children (and human nature) were innately good, and that children naturally became just and virtuous when allowed to grow without adult imposition of morality. Children did not need to be coaxed or goaded into desirable behaviour, as their natural state was satisfactory and their natural inclinations &quot;in no way immoral&quot;. If left alone, children would become self-regulating, reasonable and ethical adults. Together with Homer Lane, Neill supported personal freedoms for children to live as they please without adult interference, and called this position &quot;on the side of the child&quot;. Neill&#x27;s practice can be summarised as providing children with space, time, and empowerment for personal exploration and with freedom from adult fear and coercion.

The aim of life, to Neill, was &quot;to find happiness, which means to find interest.&quot; Likewise, the purpose of Neill&#x27;s education was to be happy and interested in life, and children needed complete freedom to find their interests. Neill considered happiness an innate characteristic that deteriorated if children were denied personal freedom. Such unhappiness led to repressed and psychologically disordered adults. He blamed a &quot;sick and unhappy&quot; society for widespread unhappiness. Neill claimed that society harboured fears of life, children and emotions that were continually bequeathed to the next generation. He felt that children turned to self-hate and internal hostility when denied an outlet for expression in adult systems of emotional regulation and manipulation. Likewise, children taught to withhold their sexuality would see such feelings negatively, which would fuel disdain for self. Neill thought that calls for obedience quenched the natural needs of children. Moreover, their needs could not be fulfilled by adults or a society that simultaneously prolonged their unhappiness, although perhaps a school like Summerhill could help.

As for &quot;interest&quot;, Neill felt it came organically and spontaneously as a prerequisite for learning. Neill considered forced instruction (without pupil interest) a destructive waste of time. Earlier in his career, he wrote that human interest releases emotions that otherwise congests a person. He added that education&#x27;s role is to facilitate that release, with Summerhill actualizing this concept. Neill never defines &quot;true interest&quot; and does not account for the social influences on child interest. Bailey felt that this omission discredits Neill&#x27;s position against external influence. Bailey also cited &quot;adaptive preferences&quot; literature, where human interests change based on their surroundings and circumstances, as evidence of how intrinsic interest can be externally influenced. Bailey also dubbed Neill&#x27;s views on intelligence as &quot;innatist&quot; and fatalist – that children had naturally set capabilities and limitations. Neill saw contemporary interventionist practice as doing harm by emphasising conformity and stifling children&#x27;s natural drive to do as they please.

Neill did not identify with the progressive educators of his time. They advocated far gentler authority in child-rearing, which Neill considered more insidious than overt authority and altogether unnecessary. All imposed authority, even if meant well, was unjustified. He felt that adults asserted authority for its feelings of power, and that this motive was a type of repression. In Neill&#x27;s philosophy, the goal was maintenance of happiness through avoidance of repressive habits from society. Despite Neill&#x27;s common citation as a leader within progressive education, his ideas were considerably more radical, and he was called an extremist by other radicals. Unlike Friedrich Fröbel, Neill did not view children with romantic innocence. He saw their animalistic traits as qualities to be &quot;outgrown with time and freedom&quot;. Neill also considered his role in providing emotional support.

Emotional education trumped intellectual needs, in Neill&#x27;s eyes, and he was associated with anti-intellectualism. In actuality, he had a personal interest in scholarship and used his autobiography near the end of his life to profess the necessity of both emotion and intellect in education, though he often took jabs at what he saw to be education&#x27;s overemphasis on book-learning. Neill felt that an emotional education freed the intellect to follow what it pleased, and that children required an emotional education to keep up with their own gradual developmental needs. This education usually entailed copious amounts of play and distance from the adult anxieties of work and ambition. Neill was influenced by Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theories of psychoanalysis, Homer Lane&#x27;s interpretation of Freud, and later, by the unorthodox sexual theories of Wilhelm Reich. The reverence for Reich appears in the abundant correspondence between them. Neill accepted Reich&#x27;s claims about cosmic energy and his utopian ideas on human sexuality. In Reich&#x27;s view, &quot;discharge&quot; of sexual energy leads to happiness, whereas lack of such discharge leads to unhappiness and &quot;rigidity&quot;. Although not a trained therapist, Neill gave psychoanalytic private lessons to individual children, designed to unblock impasses in their inner energies. Neill also offered body massage, as suggested by Reich. Neill later found that freedom cured better than this therapy.

Richard Bailey placed Neill alongside William Godwin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and Robert Owen in Thomas Sowell&#x27;s &quot;unconstrained vision&quot; tradition, where human potential is naturally unlimited and human development is dependent on environment and not incentives. Bailey also compared Neill&#x27;s thoughts on coercion to those of Godwin, who felt that regulation through reward and punishment stunted growth. Neill saw moral instruction as a wedge between natural instinct and conformity and thought children were best off without it. Neill trusted the natural inclinations of children and saw no need to externally and purposefully influence their behaviour. Denis Lawton likened Neill&#x27;s ideas to Rousseauan &quot;negative education&quot;, where children discover for themselves instead of receiving instruction. Neill is commonly associated with Rousseau for their similar thoughts on human nature, although Neill claimed to not have read Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot; until near the end of his life. John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips declared Neill &quot;the most notable figure in the Rousseauean tradition&quot;, and Frank Flanagan credited Neill with actualising what Rousseau envisaged. Marc-Alexandre Prud-homme and Giuliano Reis found the comparison &quot;inappropriate&quot; on the basis of Rousseau&#x27;s views on gender.

Peter Hobson found Neill&#x27;s philosophy of education incomplete, oversimplified, without a &quot;coherent theory of knowledge&quot;, and too dependent on his experience instead of philosophical position. When presented with Hobson&#x27;s position, four experts on Neill and Summerhill considered his assertions &quot;irrelevant&quot;. Joel Spring likened Neill&#x27;s views on the family to that of Mary Wollstonecraft, in that the parents would share power equally.

===Freedom, not licence===

When Neill said children should be free, he did not mean complete freedom, but freedom without licence—that everyone can do as they like unless such action encroaches upon another&#x27;s freedom. As such, adults could and should protect children from danger, but not trample their self-regulation. Neill emphasised that adult removal from child affairs was distinct from disregard for their security. He felt that children met their own limits naturally. Neill believed in equal rights between parents and children, and that undesirable &quot;disciplined&quot; or &quot;spoiled&quot; homes were created when those rights were imbalanced. He felt it unnecessary to fulfil all of childhood&#x27;s requests and had great disdain for spoiled children. Summerhill children were naturally restricted by the school&#x27;s limited teaching expertise and low funds.

Bailey wrote that Neill did not have full faith in self-regulation due to his emphasis on the necessity of making specific environments for children. Robin Barrow argued that Neill&#x27;s idea of self-regulation was contradictory, when its intent was, more simply, the extent to which children need to abide by external restraints. Bailey added that children cannot know the extent to which dull and unknown subjects can be exciting without guidance. He felt that Neill&#x27;s belief in children&#x27;s innate and realistic wisdom did not accommodate human characteristics &quot;such as error, prejudice, and ignorance&quot;, ascribed genius-level intelligence to children, and did not consider social aspects in child decision-making.

===Self-governance===
Self-governance was a central idea to Summerhill, and is perhaps its &quot;most fundamental feature&quot;. Summerhill held a weekly general meeting that decided the school&#x27;s rules and settled school disputes, where every member of the community—staff and student alike—had a single vote. Almost everyone in the school attended the meeting, and children always held the majority. Meetings were managed by an elected Chairperson. At times, the school had over 200 rules. His daughter says that although he was seen as benign he allowed Ena May Neill to berate the weekly meetings and she increasingly ran the school becoming the head, officially, when he died.

Summerhill sought to produce individualists conscious of their surrounding social order, and Neill chose the self-governance of Homer Lane&#x27;s Little Commonwealth for the basis of that lesson. The general meeting replaced teacher authority with communal control, which freed teachers from their roles as disciplinarians and instructed children in the role of democratic participation and the role of rules. Additionally, reports of teacher–student disputes were rare. Neill felt that the community&#x27;s authority never created resentment in those subject to sanctions. Sven Muller contended that the meeting was more useful than discipline for creating civic-minded citizens. An ex-pupil recalled some of the wild ideas Neill would propose at the meeting, and while the students would vote him down, she later recounted how the exercise was also intended as a lesson for the staff on the power of the meeting and communal authority. Neill considered self-governance &quot;the most valuable asset in education and life&quot; and the general meeting &quot;more important than all the textbooks in the world&quot;.

On occasion, Neill exercised unilateral decision-making as the owner of the school, despite his emphasis on the authority figure-less nature of the school. Instances include when he once made a decision after the group&#x27;s discussion protracted, and when he once asserted himself dictator. Ultimately, the school&#x27;s freedom was Neill&#x27;s to structure.

==Writings==
Neill wrote 20 books in his lifetime. His style was simple and friendly, unlike didactic literature from the era. His topics included the balance of authority and the thoughts–feelings relationship.

===&quot;Summerhill&quot;===

The 1960 release of &quot;Summerhill&quot; catapulted Neill into the public view. Richard Bailey described its result as &quot;an American cult&quot; of Summerhillian schools and their support organizations. The book sold well and made Neill into a figurehead of new interest in education. Bailey added that the unpretentious book&#x27;s message was easier to impart than Deweyan thought, and that its release inspired Neill&#x27;s education critic contemporaries as to the viability of their ideas.

==Reception and legacy==
Critics regard Neill&#x27;s influence and importance with mixed opinion. Supporters counted Neill amongst the world&#x27;s most influential educationists. UNESCO listed Neill within its 100 most important educationists worldwide. The &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; listed him in its 12 most important British educationists of the millennium. Herb Kohl declared Neill &quot;one of the greatest democratic educators of the last century&quot; in 2005. Academics and teachers cited Summerhill as the common ancestor for free schools, and Neill was poised to become a public figure during Summerhill&#x27;s heyday in the 1970s. Its detractors do not classify Summerhill as a school. Max Rafferty called Summerhill &quot;a caricature of education&quot; and felt threatened by the implications of &quot;the spread of Neill&#x27;s hedonism to the majority of the next generation&quot;. Others criticized Neill for his progressive ideals despite agreement on his critique of traditional schools, and bemoaned his &quot;outdated radicalism&quot; and &quot;dangerously enthusiastic following in teaching training institutions&quot;.

Richard Bailey wrote that Summerhill received most of its public attention in the 1920s to 1930s and in the 1960s to 1970s, which were eras of social change (progressivism and the counterculture, respectively). Neill was known in British education circles by the 1920s and was &quot;probably Britain&#x27;s first educational celebrity&quot; in the 1930s, though he was not driven by his reception. Journal reviews called Neill &quot;the most popular writer on education today&quot; and said of his works, &quot;Nearly all the more alive and up-to-date teachers in Britain have read and argued about his notions&quot;. He was known via his books as a figure in the new psychoanalysis. The accessible 1960 &quot;Summerhill&quot; crowned Neill the leader of a new avant-garde education and he became symbolic of the rebel decade.

Neill is generally associated with democratic schools as a leader in its tradition. H. A. T. Child associated Summerhill with the Bedales School, Alfred the Great, and Child&#x27;s Dartington Hall School, and David Gribble wrote in 1998 about schools around the world that followed Neill&#x27;s teachings. Timothy Gray linked the release of &quot;Summerhill&quot; with the rise of writers Herb Kohl, Jonathan Kozol, Neil Postman, and Ivan Illich. Scholars debate whether Neill fits best in a progressive or more radical tradition. Other schools inspired by Neill&#x27;s philosophy in the UK include Sands School in Devon, Sherwood School in Epsom and Kirkdale School in London.

Few of Neill&#x27;s acolytes continued his work after his death. His family maintained Summerhill, with Neill&#x27;s daughter as its headmaster . Others influenced by Neill included John Aitkenhead, Michael Duane, and R. F. Mackenzie. Richard Bailey wrote that Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s followers were more evangelical in character, and that Neill deterred would-be devotees. He specifically discouraged American association with his school in both name and likeness. By 1972, Ray Hemmings wrote that Neill&#x27;s ideas were misinterpreted in the hands of other schools. Hemmings found Neill to have moderate influence on state schools in areas such as teacher–student interactions. Neill&#x27;s views on sexuality and non-compulsory lessons did not have widespread acceptance. Herb Snitzer said that Neill &quot;influenced thousand of teachers&quot;. Both George Dennison and Bailey felt Neill&#x27;s influence to not be easily measurable, with Dennison adding that non-Summerhill schools continue to adopt Neillian thought.

Neill was awarded three honorary degrees: a master&#x27;s and two honorary doctorates. One doctorate was from the Newcastle University in 1966. He was reportedly very proud of the awards.

<doc id="554705" wikidata="Q8021230" url="?curid=554705" title="Williamson Park, Lancaster">
<text>Williamson Park in Lancaster, England, was constructed by millionaire James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton, and his father, also called James Williamson. Its focal point is the Ashton Memorial. The park now covers an area of 53.6 acres (217,000 m2), having been extended in 1999 onto adjoining land, Fenham Carr, following a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

==History==

The site was originally moorland and the site of a gallows. By the nineteenth century it was developed as a quarry. During the Lancashire Cotton Famine (1861–65), public works started to develop the site with a gravel drive being created by unemployed cotton spinners giving access. There were some barrows on the site of the park which were excavated in 1865. Several funerary urns and some grave goods were found. In the 1870s James Williamson senior started to develop the site, and by 1877 a plan of pathways had been drawn up. When James Williamson senior died in 1879, his son Lord Ashton took the work forward, handing the site over to Lancaster Corporation in 1881. The Ashton Memorial was added in the early twentieth century.

==Features==
Features of the park include the Ashton Memorial, fountains, a butterfly house, a café, a children&#x27;s play area, the Lancaster sundial on the site of what was once a bandstand, an artificial waterfall, some sculptures and a small folly known as the Temple. The park is extensively wooded, with many pathways winding among the trees. There were also formerly an astronomical observatory and a weather station, but these became unviable with growth of the surrounding trees. They fell into disrepair after 1939 and only fragments remain.

==Events==

===Play in the Park===
Since 1987 The Dukes Theatre, based in the city, have put on their &#x27;Play in the Park&#x27; during July and August each year. The production uses the natural scenery of the park as the stage and requires the audience to follow performers from scene to scene. The first production to be staged in the park was A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream in which Dukes&#x27; honorary patron Andy Serkis appeared. Since it began over 500,000 people have attended at Dukes&#x27; park show and the 2016 production of The Hobbit won Best Show for Children and Young People at the UK Theatre Awards.

===Highest Point Festival===
On 18–20 May 2018 the park played host to the inaugural Highest Point music festival which offered several stages across the grounds. Highest Point featured performances from Ocean Colour Scene, Rae Morris, Embrace, The Two Bears and the Hacienda Classical, and the festival was held again in May 2019.

In July 2019, it was confirmed the festival would return to Williamson Park on 15–17 May 2020. However COVID-19 caused the festival to get cancelled.

Since then further iterations of Highest Point have run in the park, in September 2021 and again in May 2022 when it was headlined by Richard Ashcroft, Clean Bandit and Kaiser Chiefs.

The sixth Highest Point festival took place in 2024, on Friday 10 May and Saturday 11 May, with the associated Big Family Day Out festival on Sunday 12 May.

===Parkrun===

A 5 km parkrun event takes place in the park every Saturday morning. The first event was held in 2016.

<text>Julius Timothy Flock (May 11, 1924 – March 31, 1998) was an American stock car racer. He was a two-time NASCAR series champion. His brothers Bob and Fonty Flock also raced in NASCAR, as did his sister Ethel Mobley (who was NASCAR&#x27;s second female driver).

==NASCAR career==

Tim Flock finished 5th in NASCAR&#x27;s inaugural Strictly Stock race at Charlotte, North Carolina in 1949; he drove an Oldsmobile 88 that he borrowed from his newlywed neighbors. NASCAR&#x27;s first official season ended with Flock in eighth, his brother Fonty Flock in fifth, and his other brother Bob Flock in third in the overall points standings. 

Flock won his first official NASCAR race in 1950 at Charlotte. He ran 12 of 19 races and finished 16th in the final standings. In 1951, Flock won seven races. 1952 brought eight wins and four poles. At the end of the 1952 NASCAR season, Flock had 106 more points than Herb Thomas, earning Flock his first NASCAR Grand National Championship title, despite flipping in the final race at West Palm Beach. Flock later joked, &quot;I was the only driver to ever win a championship upside-down.&quot; In 1954, Flock was disqualified despite winning at the Daytona Beach and Road Course for illegally screwed carburetor screws.

Flock had a rhesus monkey co-driver named &quot;Jocko Flocko&quot; with him in his May 16, 1953, Grand National win at Hickory Motor Speedway. Jocko Flocks became the only winning monkey ever. The monkey was retired two weeks later at Raleigh, where the monkey pulled the device to allow the driver to observe the right front tire and was hit by a pebble. At the time, drivers used a device to lift the wheel well to observe tire wear in case of a tire failure. Flock had to do a pit stop to remove the monkey, and he finished third (he would have won without the problem).

1955 was a record-setting year for Flock as well as NASCAR. On the way to Flock&#x27;s second Grand National Championship title, Flock had 19 poles and 18 victories in 45 races. The 18 victories stood as a record until broken by &quot;The King&quot;, Richard Petty, in 1967. The 19 poles are still the highest number in a NASCAR season.

The 1956 season saw Flock win the International Stock Car Road Race, the first NASCAR Cup event ever held at Road America. Flock followed points leader and pole-sitter Buck Baker for much of the start until many of the leaders began exiting for various problems, allowing Flock to lead the final ten laps. No other stock car events of any type were held at the track until the 1990s, and in 2010 the NASCAR Nationwide Series began racing there. Despite the win, however, the year was filled with off-track frustration for Flock, particularly with team owner Carl Kiekhaefer. Despite their combined on-track success, Flock left Kiekhaefer&#x27;s team immediately after his victory in the April 8 race at North Wilkesboro Speedway, citing stomach ulcers. Upon departing from the Kiekhaefer camp, he had compiled 21 triumphs out of his 46 starts with Kiekhaefer.

==Labor union==
In his final race before &quot;retiring&quot; Flock was disqualified and banned from NASCAR as a result of &quot;having too much solder on his carburetor screw&quot; which was illegal. This was widely known by the public to be retaliation by NASCAR management for Flock&#x27;s support of a NASCAR driver&#x27;s union. Like Curtis Turner, he faced a life ban from NASCAR. Flock continued to race under other sanctioning bodies, including the Midwest Association for Race Cars, competing in the event on the dirt at Lakewood Speedway, Georgia, in October 1961, where he finished second. He also raced at a United States Auto Club event in Concord, North Carolina, in 1963. He was reinstated to NASCAR competition in 1966.

Flock was employed by the Ford Motor Company to entertain customers at track events.

==Later years==
In 1959, he was hired by Charlotte Motor Speedway to work in various roles, including public relations and ticket sales.

His last race was the Battle of the NASCAR Legends race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1991. The race featured such drivers as Cale Yarborough, Junior Johnson, Pete Hamilton, and Donnie Allison. The winner was Elmo Langley, beating Yarborough to the line by about on the last lap. He finished 10th out of 22 drivers.

==Death==
Flock died of liver and throat cancer on March 31, 1998, at age 73, during NASCAR&#x27;s 50th anniversary season. Darrell Waltrip honored him in a special paint scheme named &quot;Tim Flock Special&quot; at Darlington Raceway weeks before Flock died. Flock was without medical insurance, and Waltrip wanted to help raise money for Flock and his family.

A month before his death, Flock was honored as one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers. He has been inducted in numerous halls of fame, including the: International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1991), Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1999), National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame (1972), State of Georgia Hall of Fame (1972), and Charlotte Motor Speedway Court of Legends (1994). He was inducted in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in May 2006. On May 22, 2013, Flock was named a member of the NASCAR Hall of Fame for 2014, to be inducted during Acceleration Weekend in January.

<doc id="554716" wikidata="Q2915383" url="?curid=554716" title="Oblivious transfer">
<text>In cryptography, an oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is a type of protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver, but remains as to what piece (if any) has been transferred.

The first form of oblivious transfer was introduced in 1981 by Michael O. Rabin. In this form, the sender sends a message to the receiver with probability 1/2, while the sender remains oblivious as to whether or not the receiver received the message. Rabin&#x27;s oblivious transfer scheme is based on the RSA cryptosystem. A more useful form of oblivious transfer called 1–2 oblivious transfer or &quot;1 out of 2 oblivious transfer&quot;, was developed later by Shimon Even, Oded Goldreich, and Abraham Lempel, in order to build protocols for secure multiparty computation. It is generalized to &quot;1 out of &quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer&quot; where the user gets exactly one database element without the server getting to know which element was queried, and without the user knowing anything about the other elements that were not retrieved. The latter notion of oblivious transfer is a strengthening of private information retrieval, in which the database is not kept private.

Claude Crépeau showed that Rabin&#x27;s oblivious transfer is equivalent to 1–2 oblivious transfer.

Further work has revealed oblivious transfer to be a fundamental and important problem in cryptography. It is considered one of the critical problems in the field, because of the importance of the applications that can be built based on it. In particular, it is complete for secure multiparty computation: that is, given an implementation of oblivious transfer it is possible to securely evaluate any polynomial time computable function without any additional primitive.

==Rabin&#x27;s oblivious transfer protocol==

In Rabin&#x27;s oblivious transfer protocol, the sender generates an RSA public modulus &quot;N&quot;=&quot;pq&quot; where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are large prime numbers, and an exponent &quot;e&quot; relatively prime to &quot;λ(N)&quot; = (&quot;p&quot; − 1)(&quot;q&quot; − 1). The sender encrypts the message &quot;m&quot; as &quot;m&quot;&quot;e&quot; mod &quot;N&quot;.

# The sender sends &quot;N&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;m&quot;&quot;e&quot; mod &quot;N&quot; to the receiver.
# The receiver picks a random &quot;x&quot; modulo &quot;N&quot; and sends &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;N&quot; to the sender. Note that gcd(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;N&quot;) = 1 with overwhelming probability, which ensures that there are 4 square roots of &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;N&quot;.
# The sender finds a square root &quot;y&quot; of &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;N&quot; and sends &quot;y&quot; to the receiver.

If the receiver finds &quot;y&quot; is neither &quot;x&quot; nor −&quot;x&quot; modulo &quot;N&quot;, the receiver will be able to factor &quot;N&quot; and therefore decrypt &quot;m&quot;&quot;e&quot; to recover &quot;m&quot; (see Rabin encryption for more details). However, if &quot;y&quot; is &quot;x&quot; or −&quot;x&quot; mod &quot;N&quot;, the receiver will have no information about &quot;m&quot; beyond the encryption of it. Since every quadratic residue modulo &quot;N&quot; has four square roots, the probability that the receiver learns &quot;m&quot; is 1/2.

==1–2 oblivious transfer==

In a 1–2 oblivious transfer protocol, Alice the sender has two messages &quot;m&quot;0 and &quot;m&quot;1, and wants to ensure that the receiver only learns one. Bob, the receiver, has a bit &quot;b&quot; and wishes to receive &quot;m&quot;&quot;b&quot; without Alice learning &quot;b&quot;.
The protocol of Even, Goldreich, and Lempel (which the authors attribute partially to Silvio Micali) is general, but can be instantiated using RSA encryption as follows.

# Alice has two messages, formula_1 and wants to send exactly one of them to Bob. Bob does not want Alice to know which one he receives.
# Alice generates an RSA key pair, comprising the modulus formula_2, the public exponent formula_3 and the private exponent formula_4.
# She also generates two random values, formula_5 and sends them to Bob along with her public modulus and exponent.
# Bob picks formula_6 to be either 0 or 1, and selects formula_7.
# Bob generates a random value formula_8 uses it to blind formula_7 by computing formula_10, which he sends to Alice.
# Alice combines formula_11 with both of her random values to produce: formula_12 and formula_13. Now formula_14 will be equal to formula_8 and the other will be a meaningless random value. However since Alice does not know the value of formula_6 that Bob chose, she cannot determine which of formula_17 and formula_18 is equal to formula_8.
# She combines the two secret messages with each of the possible keys, formula_20 and formula_21, and sends them both to Bob.
# Bob knows formula_8, so he is able to compute formula_23. However, since he does not know formula_4, he cannot compute formula_25 and so cannot determine formula_26.

==1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer and &quot;k&quot;-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer==

A 1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer protocol can be defined as a natural generalization of a 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol. Specifically, a sender has &quot;n&quot; messages, and the receiver has an index &quot;i&quot;, and the receiver wishes to receive the &quot;i&quot;-th among the sender&#x27;s messages, without the sender learning &quot;i&quot;, while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the &quot;n&quot; messages.

1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer is incomparable to private information retrieval (PIR). 
On the one hand, 1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer imposes an additional privacy requirement for the database: namely, that the receiver learn at most one of the database entries. On the other hand, PIR requires communication sublinear in &quot;n&quot;, whereas 1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer has no such requirement. However, assuming single server PIR is a sufficient assumption in order to construct 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer.

1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer protocol with sublinear communication was first constructed (as a generalization of single-server PIR) by Eyal Kushilevitz and Rafail Ostrovsky. More efficient constructions were proposed by Moni Naor and Benny Pinkas, William Aiello, Yuval Ishai and Omer Reingold, Sven Laur and Helger Lipmaa. In 2017, Kolesnikov et al., proposed an efficient 1-n oblivious transfer protocol which requires roughly 4x the cost of 1-2 oblivious transfer in amortized setting.

Brassard, Crépeau and Robert further generalized this notion to &quot;k&quot;-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer, wherein the receiver obtains a set of &quot;k&quot; messages from the &quot;n&quot; message collection. The set of &quot;k&quot; messages may be received simultaneously (&quot;non-adaptively&quot;), or they may be requested consecutively, with each request based on previous messages received.

==Generalized oblivious transfer==
&quot;k&quot;-&quot;n&quot; Oblivious transfer is a special case of generalized oblivious transfer, which was presented by Ishai and Kushilevitz. In that setting, the sender has a set &quot;U&quot; of &quot;n&quot; messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection &quot;A&quot; of permissible subsets of &quot;U&quot;.
The receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in &quot;U&quot; that appears in the collection &quot;A&quot;. The sender should remain oblivious of the selection made by the receiver, while the receiver cannot learn the value of the messages outside the subset of messages that he chose to obtain. The collection &quot;A&quot; is monotone decreasing, in the sense that it is closed under containment (i.e., if a given subset &quot;B&quot; is in the collection &quot;A&quot;, so are all of the subsets of &quot;B&quot;).
The solution proposed by Ishai and Kushilevitz uses the parallel invocations of 1-2 oblivious transfer while making use of a special model of private protocols. Later on, other solutions that are based on secret sharing were published – one by Bhavani Shankar, Kannan Srinathan, and C. Pandu Rangan, and another by Tamir Tassa.

==Origins==
In the early seventies Stephen Wiesner introduced a primitive called multiplexing in his seminal paper &quot;Conjugate Coding&quot;,
which was the starting point of quantum cryptography. Unfortunately it took more than ten years to be published. Even though
this primitive was equivalent to what was later called &quot;1–2 oblivious transfer&quot;, Wiesner did not see its application to cryptography.

==Quantum oblivious transfer==

Protocols for oblivious transfer can be implemented with quantum systems. In contrast to other tasks in quantum cryptography, like quantum key distribution, it has been shown that quantum oblivious transfer cannot be implemented with unconditional security, i.e. the security of quantum oblivious transfer protocols cannot be guaranteed only from the laws of quantum physics.

<text>Ridley Hall is a theological college located on the corner of Sidgwick Avenue and Ridley Hall Road in Cambridge (United Kingdom), which trains men and women intending to take Holy Orders as deacon or priest of the Church of England, and members of the laity working with children and young people as lay pioneers and within a pastoral capacity such as lay chaplaincy.

==History==
Ridley Hall was founded in 1881 and named in memory of Nicholas Ridley, a leading Anglican theologian and martyr of the sixteenth century. The college&#x27;s first principal was the theologian Handley Moule, later Bishop of Durham. It was founded under the same Deed of Trust as its sister college Wycliffe Hall, Oxford and to this day both colleges have the ability to nominate two members to the Hall Council of the other.

===Present day===
Ridley Hall offers several Common Award qualifications, validated by Durham University. Although not a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, the school has ties with the university&#x27;s Faculty of Divinity. Some students who are also in a constituent college of the university can be awarded qualifications by Cambridge. Ridley Hall forms part of the Cambridge Theological Federation, along with Westcott House, Westminster College, the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies, and others.

Ridley Hall&#x27;s teaching leans towards an evangelical theology. It is one of three Church of England theological colleges that self-identify as &quot;Open Evangelical&quot;, the others being Trinity College in Bristol, and Cranmer Hall in Durham.

In November 2023 it was announced that the Revd Prebendary Dr Isabelle Hamley would be the next principal, after it was announced that Michael Volland would be leaving to become the next Bishop of Birmingham. Isabelle took up this role in April 2024.

It publishes an academic journal, &quot;Anvil&quot;.

<doc id="554718" wikidata="Q3177480" url="?curid=554718" title="William Law">
<text>William Law (16869 April 1761) was a Church of England priest who lost his position at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, when his conscience would not allow him to take the required oath of allegiance to the first Hanoverian monarch, King George I. Previously, William Law had given his allegiance to the House of Stuart and is sometimes considered a second-generation non-juror. Thereafter, Law continued as a simple priest (curate), and when that too became impossible without the required oath, Law taught privately and wrote extensively. His personal integrity, as well as his mystic and theological writing, greatly influenced the evangelistic movement of his day, as well as Enlightenment thinkers such as the writer Samuel Johnson and the historian Edward Gibbon. In 1784, William Wilberforce (1759–1833), the politician, philanthropist, and leader of the movement to stop the slave trade, was deeply touched by reading William Law&#x27;s book &quot;A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life&quot; (1729). Law&#x27;s spiritual writings remain in print today.

==Early life==
Law was born at King&#x27;s Cliffe, Northamptonshire, in 1686, the son of Thomas Law, a grocer. In 1705 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a sizar, where he studied the classics, Hebrew, philosophy and mathematics. In 1711 he was elected fellow of his college and was ordained. His brothers Farmery and Nathaniel also studied at Cambridge University and were ordained. He resided at Cambridge, teaching and taking occasional duty until the 1714 accession of George I, when his conscience forbade him to take the oaths of allegiance to the new government and of abjuration of the Stuarts. His Jacobitism had already been betrayed in a tripos speech. As a non-juror, he was deprived of his fellowship.

For the next few years Law is said to have been a curate in London. By 1727 he lived with Edward Gibbon (1666–1736) at Putney as tutor to his son Edward, father of the historian, who says that Law became the much-honoured friend and spiritual director of the family. In the same year he accompanied his pupil to Cambridge and lived with him as governor, in term time, for the next four years. His pupil then went abroad but Law was left at Putney, where he remained in Gibbon&#x27;s house for more than 10 years, acting as a religious guide not only to the family but to a number of earnest-minded people who came to consult him. The most eminent of these were the two brothers John and Charles Wesley, the poet John Byrom, the Newtonian physician George Cheyne, and Archibald Hutcheson, MP for Hastings.

The household dispersed in 1737. Law retired to King&#x27;s Cliffe by 1740, where he had inherited from his father a house and a small property. There, he was joined by Elizabeth Hutcheson, the rich widow of his old friend (who recommended on his death-bed that she place herself under Law&#x27;s spiritual guidance), and Hester Gibbon, sister to his late pupil. For the next 21 years, the trio devoted themselves to worship, study and charity, until Law died on 9 April 1761.

==Bangorian controversy and after==

The first of Law&#x27;s controversial works was &quot;Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor&quot; (1717), a contribution to the Bangorian controversy on the high-church side. It was followed by &quot;Remarks on Mandeville&#x27;s Fable of the Bees&quot; (1723), in which he vindicated morality; it was praised by John Sterling, and republished by F. D. Maurice. Law&#x27;s &quot;Case of Reason&quot; (1732), in answer to Tindal&#x27;s &quot;Christianity as old as the Creation&quot;, is to some extent an anticipation of Joseph Butler&#x27;s argument in the &quot;Analogy of Religion&quot;. His &quot;Letters to a Lady inclined to enter the Church of Rome&quot; are specimens of the attitude of a High Church Anglican towards Roman Catholicism.

==Writings on practical divinity==
&quot;A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life&quot; (1729), together with its predecessor, &quot;A Practical Treatise Upon Christian Perfection&quot; (1726), deeply influenced the chief actors in the great evangelistic revival. John and Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, Henry Venn, Thomas Scott and Thomas Adam all expressed their deep obligation to the author. &quot;The Serious Call&quot; also affected others deeply. Samuel Johnson, Gibbon, Lord Lyttelton and Bishop Home all spoke enthusiastically of its merits; and it is still the work by which its author is popularly known. It has high merits of style, being lucid and pointed to a degree.

In a tract entitled &quot;The Absolute Unlawfulness of the Stage Entertainment&quot; (1726), Law was agitated by the corruptions of the stage to preach against all plays, and incurred some criticism the same year from John Dennis in &quot;The Stage Defended&quot;.

His writing is anthologised by various denominations, including in the Classics of Western Spirituality series by the Catholic Paulist Press.

The devotional writer Andrew Murray was so impressed by Law&#x27;s writings that he republished a number of his works, stating &quot;I do not know where to find anywhere else the same clear and powerful statement of the truth which the Church needs at the present day.&quot;

==Mysticism==

In his later years, Law became an admirer of the German Christian mystic Jakob Böhme. The journal of John Byrom mentions that, probably around 1735 or 1736, the physician and Behmenist George Cheyne had drawn Law&#x27;s attention to the book &quot;Fides et Ratio&quot;, written in 1708 by the French Protestant theologian Pierre Poiret. It was in this book that Law came across the name of the mystic Jakob Böhme. From then on, Law&#x27;s writings, such as &quot;A Demonstration of the Errors of a late Book&quot; (1737) and &quot;The Grounds and Reasons of Christian Regeneration&quot; (1739), contained a mystical note. In 1740 appeared &quot;An Earnest and Serious Answer to Dr. Trapp&quot; and in 1742 &quot;An Appeal to All that Doubt&quot;. &quot;An Appeal&quot; was greatly admired by Law&#x27;s friend George Cheyne, who wrote on 9 March 1742 to his good friend, the printer and novelist Samuel Richardson: &quot;Have you seen Law&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; ... it is admirable and unanswerable&quot;. John Byrom wrote a poem based on &quot;An Earnest and Serious Answer&quot;, which was found among the manuscripts of Samuel Richardson after his death in 1761.

Law&#x27;s mystical tendencies caused the first breach in 1738 between Law and the practical-minded John Wesley after an exchange of four letters in which each explained his own position. After eighteen years of silence, Wesley attacked Law and his Behmenist philosophy once again in an open letter in 1756 in which Wesley wrote:
&quot;I have scarce met with a greater friend to darkness except &#x27;the illuminated Jacob Behmen&#x27;. But, Sir, have you not done him an irreparable injury? I do not mean by misrepresenting his sentiments; (though some of his profound admirers are positive that you misunderstand and murder him throughout) but by dragging him out of his awful obscurity; by pouring light upon his venerable darkness. Men may admire the deepness of the well, and the excellence of the water it contains: But if some officious person puts a light into it, it will appear to be both very shallow and very dirty. I could not have borne to spend so many words on so egregious trifles, but that they are mischievous trifles: ... bad philosophy has, by insensible degrees, paved the way for bad divinity.&quot;

Law never responded to this open letter, though he had been deeply upset, as testified by John Byrom.

After seven years of silence, Law further explored Böhme&#x27;s ideas in &quot;The Spirit of Prayer&quot; (1749–1750), followed by &quot;The Way to Divine Knowledge&quot; (1752) and &quot;The Spirit of Love&quot; (1752–1754). He worked on a new translation of Böhme&#x27;s works, for which &quot;The Way to Divine Knowledge&quot; had been the preparation. Samuel Richardson had been involved in the printing of some of Law&#x27;s works, e.g. &quot;A Practical Treatise upon Christian Perfection&quot; (second edition of 1728), and &quot;The Way to Divine Knowledge&quot; (1752), since Law&#x27;s publishers William and John Innys worked closely with Samuel Richardson.

Law had taught himself the &quot;High Dutch Language&quot; to be able to read the original text of the &quot;blessed Jacob&quot;. He owned a quarto edition of 1715, which had been carefully printed from the Johann Georg Gichtel edition of 1682, printed in Amsterdam where Gichtel (1638–1710) lived and worked.

After the death of both Law and Richardson in 1761, Law&#x27;s friends George Ward and Thomas Langcake published a four-volume version of the works of Jakob Böhme between 1764 and 1781. It was paid for by Elizabeth Hutcheson. This version became known as the &quot;Law-edition of Böhme&quot;, even though Law had never found the time to contribute to this new edition. As a result of this, it was ultimately based on the original translations made by John Ellistone and John Sparrow between 1645 and 1662, with only a few changes. This edition was greatly admired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Blake. Law had found some illustrations made by the German early Böhme exegetist Dionysius Andreas Freher (1649–1728), which had been included in this edition. Upon seeing these symbolic drawings, Blake said during a dinner party in 1825 &quot;Michel Angelo could not have surpassed them&quot;.

===Law&#x27;s admiration for Isaac Newton and Jakob Böhme===
Law greatly admired both Isaac Newton, whom he called &quot;this great philosopher&quot;, and Jakob Böhme, &quot;the illuminated instrument of God&quot;. In part I of &quot;The Spirit of Love&quot; (1752) Law wrote that in the three properties of desire one can see the &quot;Ground and Reason&quot; of the three great &quot;laws of matter and motion lately discovered [by Sir Isaac Newton]&quot;. Law added that he &quot;need[ed] no more to be told that the illustrious Sir Isaac [had] ploughed with Behmen&#x27;s heifer&quot;, which had led to the discovery of these laws.

Law added that in the mathematical system of Newton these three properties of desire, i.e. &quot;attraction, equal resistance, and the orbicular motion of the planets as the effect of them&quot;, are treated as facts and appearances, whose ground appears not to be known. However, Law wrote, it is in &quot;our Behmen, the illuminated Instrument of God&quot; that:

&quot;Their Birth and Power in Eternity are opened; their eternal Beginning is shown, and how and why all Worlds, and every Life of every Creature, whether it be heavenly, earthly, or hellish, must be in them, and from them, and can have no Nature, either spiritual or material, no kind of Happiness or Misery, but according to the working Power and State of these Properties. All outward Nature, all inward Life, is what it is, and works as it works, from this unceasing powerful Attraction, Resistance, and Whirling.&quot;

Aldous Huxley quotes admiringly and at length from Law&#x27;s writings on mysticism in his anthology &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;, pointing out remarkable parallels between his (Law&#x27;s) mystical insights and those of Mahayana Buddhism, Vedanta, Sufism, Taoism and other traditions encompassed by Leibniz&#x27;s concept of the Philosophia Perennis. Huxley wrote:
&quot;Granted that the ground of the individual soul is akin to...the divine Ground of all existence...what is the ultimate nature of good and evil, and what the true purpose and end of life? The answers to these questions will be given to a great extent in the words of that most surprising product of the English eighteenth century, William Law...a man who was not only a master of English prose, but also one of the most interesting thinkers of his period and one of the most endearingly saintly figures in the whole history of Anglicanism&quot;.

==Veneration==
Law is honoured on 10 April on the calendars of the Church of England and the Episcopal Church.

<text>Folle blanche (), also known as Picpoule, Gros Plant, and Enrageat blanc, is a wine grape variety from southwest France. It was the traditional grape variety in Cognac and Armagnac production until the 20th century. Folle blanche is an offspring of Gouais blanc, with the other parent so far unidentified.

It has been mostly replaced by its hybrid offspring Baco blanc due to phylloxera damage. Baco blanc (also known as Baco 22 A) is a cross of Folle blanche and the &quot;Vitis riparia × Vitis labrusca&quot; hybrid Noah. Folle blanche is also the parent of the very hardy and disease-resistant Baco 1 (or Baco noir), a cross of Folle blanche and a &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; variety. Baco noir and Baco 22 A, like Folle blanche and their other parents, produce a very acid wine. This makes them more suited to distillation than less acidic grapes.

Folle blanche is used in the Loire Valley area and in Brittany around Nantes to produce Gros Plant du Pays Nantais, a very dry and often tartly acidic wine that pairs well with shellfish. There it is used both in the production of table wine as well as &quot;eau de vie&quot;.

==History==

The first recorded mentioning of Folle blanche was in 1696 when the grape was documented as one of the varieties growing in the Charente-Maritime department. Here the grape has had a long history being used in the production of Cognac and Armagnac. The name &quot;Folle&quot; is a feminine derivative of the French word &quot;fou&quot; which means &quot;mad&quot; with ampelographers speculating that this could be a reference to the grapevine&#x27;s tendency to being highly productive and grow vigorously where ever it is planted. Several of Folle blanche&#x27;s synonyms also seems to make similar allusions such as &quot;Gros Plant&quot; (&quot;big vine&quot;) which was first used for the grape in 1732 in the Loire-Atlantique department and &quot;Enrageat&quot; (from the French &quot;enragé&quot;) that has been a common synonym for Folle blanche in Southwest France since at least 1736.

DNA analysis in the late 20th and early 21st century has concluded that Folle blanche is likely one of the numerous offspring vines of Gouais blanc, though the second parent is currently unknown. In 2001, French ampelographer Guy Lavignac theorized that Folle blanche likely originated in either the Landes or Gers departments of Southwest France due to the proliferation of offspring and sibling varieties of Folle blanche in those regions.

Historically, Folle blanche was planted along the western coast of France from the Loire Valley down through Gascony by Dutch wine merchants who used it in the production of &quot;eau de vie&quot;. After the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century, plantings of Folle blanche declined as wine growers switched to heartier, more rot resistant varieties such as the Baco blanc grape in the Cognac and Armagnac regions. This trend continued throughout most of the 20th century and into the 21st century as plantings of Folle blanche steadily declined from in 1958 to in 2009.

===Relationship to other grapes===

Through its offspring relationship with the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc, Folle blanche is at least a half-sibling of numerous grape varieties including Aubin vert, Bachet noir, Knipperlé, Montils, Peurion, Roublot, Dameron, Balzac blanc and Genouillet. American ampelographer Linda Bisson classifies Folle blanche as a member of the Folle ampelographic group with strong similarities and potential genetic relationship with fellow Folle grapes Meslier-Saint-François and Petit Meslier.

The rare Bordeaux wine grape Merlot blanc is a natural crossing of Folle blanche and Merlot that was discovered in 1891. Other grapes that have a parent-offspring relationship with Folle blanche include Monbadon, also known as Burger in California, which is believed to be a crossing of Folle blanche and Ugni blanc and Jurancon blanc, which is believed to be a crossing of Folle blanche with Pruéras

At one point Folle blanche was thought to be a color mutation of Jurancon noir (which is also known as Folle noire) but DNA analysis in 2009 showed that the black berried Jurancon grape was actually an offspring of Folle blanche through a natural crossing with Malbec. Additionally, Fuella nera (another grape known under the synonym Folle noire) was once speculated to have been a color mutation but DNA evidence has shown that is not the case.

Folle blanche has been used to breed a number of new varieties including Baco blanc (with Noah) and Baco noir (with an unknown &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; species) with both made by grape breeder François Baco as well as Folignan which was created in 1965 at the Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA) as a crossing with Ugni blanc.

===Confusion with other varieties===
Due to its complex genetic relationship with numerous varieties, Folle blanche is often mistaken for grape varieties that share some familial relationship such as its half-sibling Knipperlé. The synonyms &quot;Piquepoul&quot; used in the Gascony region and &quot;Piquepoul du Gers&quot; used in the Lot-et-Garonne department lead to confusion with the Rhône wine grape Piquepoul blanc but DNA analysis has shown no close relationship with the two varieties.

==Viticulture==

While Folle blanche can be a very productive, mid-ripening and high yielding variety, it is highly susceptible to a number of viticultural hazards including downy mildew, mites and black rot. The early budding nature of the vine also makes it susceptible to spring time frost damage while the very compact clusters makes the berries susceptible to fungal infections like botrytis bunch rot.

==Wine regions==

In 2009, there was of Folle blanche growing in France, most of it in the Pay Nantais region (overlapping the Muscadet region) of the Loire Valley where it is used to make the &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) wine Gros Plant du Pays Nantais. While the grape&#x27;s use in Cognac and Armagnac has largely fallen out of favor in preference to Baco blanc, some producers in Armagnac make a varietal brandy out of the grape.

Outside France Folle blanche is grown in the Basque Country where it is known as Mune Mahatsa and is sometimes blended with Hondarribi Zuri (Courbu blanc). In the Catalan wine region of Spain it is used by some brandy producers. In California there are a few limited plantings of the variety.

==Styles==
According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Folle blanche tends to produce rustic base wines with high levels of acidity.

==Synonyms==
Over the years, Folle blanche has been known under a variety of synonyms including:

<doc id="554721" wikidata="Q5744920" url="?curid=554721" title="Hertzian cone">
<text>A Hertzian cone is the cone produced when an object passes through a solid, such as a bullet through glass. More technically, it is a cone of force that propagates through a brittle, amorphous, or cryptocrystalline solid material from a point of impact. This force eventually removes a full or partial cone in the material. This is the physical principle that explains the form and characteristics of the flakes removed from a core of tool stone during the process of lithic reduction.

This phenomenon is named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, who first described this type of wave-front propagation through various media.

Although it might not be agreed by all, natural phenomena which have been grouped with the Hertzian cone phenomena include the crescentic &quot;chatter marks&quot; made on smoothed bedrock by glacial ice dragging along boulders at its base, the numerous crescentic impact marks sometimes seen on pebbles and cobbles, and the shatter cones found at bolide impact sites. James Byous, working independently (at privately funded Dowd Research, Savannah, Georgia USA) has made a protracted study of Hertzian cones. Some of his work may be found via sharing points or directly at Dowd Research. He has produced a comprehensive glossary on Hertzian fractures and related terms. A Hertzian cone is often 104 degrees when created by an indenter. Smaller cones may be produced due to lack of size of the material, or irregularities in the structure of the material. However, in ballistics, the faster the projectile the steeper the edges and angle of the cone.

<doc id="554723" wikidata="Q28671976" url="?curid=554723" title="Polish diaspora">
<text>The Polish diaspora comprises Poles and people of Polish heritage or origin who live outside Poland. The Polish diaspora is also known in modern Polish as Polonia, the name for Poland in Latin and many Romance languages.

There are roughly 20,000,000 people of Polish ancestry living outside Poland, making the Polish diaspora one of the largest in the world and one of the most widely dispersed. Reasons for displacement include border shifts, forced expulsions, resettlement by voluntary and forced exile, and political or economic emigration.

Substantial populations of Polish ancestry can be found in their native region of Central and Eastern Europe and many other European countries as well as in the Americas and Australia.

The Polonia in English-speaking countries often uses a dialect of Polish called &quot;Ponglish.&quot; It is made up of a Polish core with many English words inside it.

There are also smaller Polish communities in Asia and Africa, most notably Kazakhstan and South Africa.
==History==

Poles participated in the creation of the first European settlements in the Americas. In the 17th century, Polish missionaries arrived for the first time in Japan. Vast numbers of Poles left the country during the Partitions of Poland for economic and political reasons as well as the ethnic persecution practised by Russia, Prussia and Austria.

Many of the Poles who emigrated were Jews, who make up part of the Jewish diaspora. The Second Polish Republic was home to the world&#x27;s largest Jewish population. It was followed by invasions of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union. Around 6 million Polish citizens perished during World War II: about one fifth of the pre-war population. Around 3 million of which were Polish Jews murdered in the Holocaust by Nazi Germany during World War II. Most survivors subsequently migrated to Mandate Palestine since Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or exit permits at the end of the war. Many remaining Jews, including Stalinist hardliners and members of security apparatus, left Poland during the 1968 political crisis, when the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, pressured by Leonid Brezhnev, joined the Soviet &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; campaign that was triggered by the Six-Day War. In 1998, Poland&#x27;s Jewish population was estimated at 10,000 to 30,000.

A recent, large emigration of Poles took place after Poland acceded to the European Union and opening of the EU&#x27;s labour market. About 2 million primarily young Poles took up jobs abroad.
Most Poles live in Europe, the Americas, and Australia, but a few Poles have settled in smaller numbers in Asia, Africa, and Oceania, as economic migrants or as part of Catholic missions.

== Europe ==
&quot;All countries and areas of residence thereafter are listed in alphabetical order.&quot;

=== Austria ===
=== Belarus ===
According to the census, there are 396,000 Poles living in Belarus (official 1999 census; the estimates are higher according to various NGOs). They form the second-largest ethnic minority in the country, after Russians. Most Poles live in western Belarus (including 294,000 in the Grodno Region, ).

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union forcibly resettled large numbers of Belarusian Poles to Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Few Belarusian Poles now live in Siberia and the Russian Far East, and some of those who managed to survive resettlement returned to Poland after 1956.

The census of 1959 had 538,881 ethnic Poles in Belarus (332,300 in Grodno Region, 83,800 in Vitebsk Region, 70,000 in Minsk Region including Minsk, 42,100 in Brest Region, 7,200 in Gomel Region and 3,500 in Mogilev Region).

===Benelux===

There were some migrations from Poland to the Netherlands in the early modern period, with notable emmigrants including painters Krzysztof Lubieniecki and Teodor Lubieniecki, and Admiral Krzysztof Arciszewski who served in the Dutch West India Company.
Some 200 Poles, mostly intelligentsia and military officers, fled to Belgium after the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising in the 1830s, with some 60 officers employed the Belgian army, including Polish General Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, who was in charge of organizing the newly formed Belgian army, and others serving as instructors. The Great Emigration marked the first notable wave of Polish migration to Belgium. Some 200 Poles fled to Belgium, mostly to Brussels, Ghent and Liège, after the fall of the Polish January Uprising.

Polish immigration to the Netherlands has steadily increased since Poland joined the EU, and now 173,231 Polish people live in the country (2021, first generation. Most of them are guest workers from the European Union contract labour program, as more Poles obtain light industrial jobs. The number of Polish nationals could double in the next decade, depending on economic conditions in Poland. Most Poles in the Netherlands are in The Hague (30,000), but Polish émigrés have been long settled in Amsterdam and industrial towns or cities like Utrecht and Groningen. Polish immigrants arrived to find employment in the country in the 19th and 20th centuries. Some 3,200 Poles lived in the Netherlands in the 1920s.

Belgium has 70,000 Poles, but the number of Belgians of Polish descent could be as high as 200,000). Present Queen of the Belgians, Mathilde, is daughter to a Pole, Countess Anna Maria d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz, &quot;née&quot; Komorowska.

Luxembourg has 4,844 (as of 2020).

===Bulgaria===

According to 2023 estimates of the Polish Embassy in Sofia, some 5,500 Poles and people of Polish descent live in Bulgaria. Polish presence in Bulgaria dates back to the 19th century, with Poles contributing to the development of the country, after it regained independence.

=== Czech Republic ===

The Polish community in the Czech Republic is concentrated in Cieszyn Silesia (or Trans-Olza), in the northeast of the country. It traces its origins to border changes after the First World War that partitioned the area between Poland and what was then Czechoslovakia, leaving many Poles on what is now the Czech side of the border. The Polish population was 38,218 at the 2021 census.

===Denmark===
By 1904, there was a Polish community consisting of several thousand workers scattered throughout Denmark. &quot;Polak w Danii&quot; (&quot;Pole in Denmark&quot;), the oldest Polish newspaper in Denmark, was first published in July 1918, several months before Poland regained independence.

It is estimated that around 40,000 Poles live in Denmark. Most live in the capital, Copenhagen.

====Faroe Islands====
Poles make up 0.2% of the population of the Faroe Islands, followed by Norwegians. Most live in the capital, Tórshavn.

===Finland===
The history of the Polish community in Finland dates from the early 19th century when many Poles from the Russian-controlled part of the country settled there. In 1917, there were around 4,000 Poles in Finland, mostly soldiers of the Russian Imperial Army. In 1917, the Polish Legion in Finland was formed to fight for Finnish independence and then stationed in Viipuri, and after the Finnish victory some 2,500 Polish soldiers were evacuated to Poland. Some 200 Poles lived in Finland in the 1920s.

Finland has never been a major destination for Polish immigrants, and only around 5,400 Poles live there. Most are well-educated: musicians, medical doctors, engineers and architects with families. Around half lives in Helsinki, and the biggest Polish organization there is the Polish Association, founded on April 3, 1917.

===France===
Between 500,000 and one million people of Polish descent live in France. They are concentrated in the Nord-Pas de Calais region, the metropolitan areas of Lille and Paris and the coal-mining basin (&quot;Bassin Minier&quot;) around Lens and Valenciennes. Prominent members have included Frédéric Chopin, Adam Mickiewicz, René Goscinny, Marie Curie, Michel Poniatowski, Raymond Kopa, Ludovic Obraniak and Edward Gierek. For centuries, there was an alliance between the France and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth: the longest-reigning queen consort of France has been a Pole, Marie Leszczyńska. Many Poles settled in France after the rule of Napoleon and the collapse of the Duchy of Warsaw, when 100,000 Poles, largely political refugees, fled the Russians and Prussians, who took over Poland. The Great Emigration, from the first half of the 19th century onwards, caused many Poles to be enlisted to fight in the French army. Another wave of Polish migration took place between the two World Wars when many were hired as contract workers to work temporarily in France. Polish refugees also fled the Nazi and Soviet occupations in the 1940s. From 100,000 to 200,000 Poles have been estimated to live in Paris. Many EU immigrants are in southern France, including the cities of Arles, Marseille and Perpignan.

===Germany===

The second-largest Polonia in the world and the largest in Europe is the Polish minority in Germany. Estimates of the number of Poles living in Germany vary from 2 million to about 3 million.
The main Polonia organization is Kongres Polonii Niemieckiej / Polnischer Kongress in Deutschland.

===Greece===

The Polish minority in Greece numbers more than 50,000, most of whom are first-generation immigrants. There might be many more since the Greek Orthodox Church administers Greek names for marriage and christening. Statistics show that over 300,000 Poles visit Greece each year for tourism, especially during the summer months. Famous people with mixed Polish and Greek ethnicity include Polish singer Eleni Tzoka.

===Hungary===

The Polish minority in Hungary is 7,001, according to the 2011 census, and has a long history of over 1000 years. The Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth contained five exclaves in Spisz surrounded by territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, and following the Partitions of Poland, the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918), contained Spisz and Orava with sizeable indigenous Polish populations. Hungary–Poland relations are strong and positive and best described in a poem, &quot;Pole, Hungarian, two good friends,&quot; about the fraternal sense of commonality in both Polish and Hungarian cultures. Budapest is home to a large Polish community, and there are also ethnic Poles in the northern part of the country, bordering Slovakia and Ukraine. Most Polish-Hungarians are practising Roman Catholics, but many are members of the Eastern (Polish-Carpathian or Carpato-Ukrainian) and Greek Catholic Churches.

===Iceland===
In 2021, Statistics Iceland recorded 18,508 Polish-born people living in Iceland, with Poles constituting roughly 5% of the total population. Poles are, by far, the largest ethnic minority in the country.

===Ireland===
After Poland joined the European Union in 2004, Ireland immediately opened its borders and welcomed Polish workers as relatively cheap qualified labour (only the United Kingdom and Sweden did the same). Ireland quickly became a key destination for young Poles seeking work outside the country. According to the 2011 census, there are 122,585 Poles living in Ireland, the largest ethnic minority in the country.

===Italy===
The Polish minority of confirmed status in Italy is 74,981, whereas the estimated total is 100,000, as of 2023. Most Poles are late-20th-century immigrants drawn by the Italian economy&#x27;s desire for imported labour. Large Polish immigrant communities are found in Rome, Milan and Venice. Polish immigration to Italy might continue while the EU contract labour program between the two countries remains in place.

History of Polish migration to Italy dates back over 500 years. In the 1920s, some 1,000 Poles lived in Italy, mostly clergy, artists, scholars and students, with Polish associations active in Rome and Trieste.

===Latvia===

Poles form about 2.3% of Latvia&#x27;s total population and number 51,548 people. They are mainly concentrated in Latvia&#x27;s largest cities: Riga and Daugavpils. Since most of them don&#x27;t use Latvian as their primary language their citizenship status can vary.

===Lithuania===
According to 2021 census, Poles are 6.52% of Lithuania&#x27;s population, totaling 183,421 people and over 16% of Vilnius population.

=== Malta ===
===Moldova===
Polish presence in the territories of present-day Moldova dates back several centuries, as the northern part of modern Transnistria formed part of the Kingdom of Poland before the Partitions of Poland, and the Principality of Moldavia was a vassal state of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at various times. The most numerous Polish communities in Moldova live in the cities of Bălți, Chișinău, Rîbnița (former ) and Tiraspol. According to the 2004 census, comprising both Moldova and Transnistria, there were 4,174 Poles in the country.

===Norway===

According to the Norwegian Statistics Bureau (&quot;Statistisk sentralbyrå&quot;), there are 137,425 Poles in Norway (2024 Official Norway estimate) and makeup 2.48% of the Norwegian population. It is the largest ethnic minority in the country. Norway has recently experienced an influx of Polish migrant workers. This is because Norway is a member of the European Economic Area, providing the same free movement of labour as between members of the European Union.

=== Portugal ===
There are, as of December 2022, approximately 4,326 Poles in Portugal, mainly recent immigrants. In addition, around 300 Poles have acquired Portuguese citizenship since 2008 thus making the number of Poles in the country stand at around 4,650 people. Amongst the most notable Luso-Poles there are José de Chelmicki, general of the Portuguese army, revolutionary , architect , writer , intellectual , historian Samuel Schwartz and footballer Tomás Podstawski.

===Romania===
According to the 2021 census, 2,137 Poles live in Romania, mainly in the villages of the Suceava County (). There are even three exclusively Polish villages: &quot;Nowy Sołoniec&quot; (Soloneţu Nou), &quot;Plesza&quot; (Pleşa), and &quot;Pojana Mikuli&quot; (Poiana Micului). Poles in Romania form an officially recognised national minority and have one seat in the Chamber of Deputies (currently held by Ghervazen Longher) and access to Polish elementary schools and cultural centres (known as &quot;Polish Houses&quot;).

===Russia===
Following the Partitions of Poland, Russia annexed the largest portion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and afterwards many Poles were either deported eastwards as political prisoners or were conscripted to the Russian Army, and some migrated voluntarily.

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union annexed large parts of Poland&#x27;s former eastern territories of Kresy. Many Poles were expelled, but a significant number remained in what is now Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania. The Soviet authorities also forcibly resettled large numbers of Poles to Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. In Russia there are about 47,000 Poles. See Polish minority in Russia for details.

===Serbia===
There is a small community of descendants of Silesian miners in Ostojićevo. In the 2011 census, 741 declared themselves as Poles.

===Slovakia===
According to the 2011 Slovak census results, there are 3,084 (0.1%) Poles living in Slovakia. Compared to the Hungarian census of 1910, there has been a significant decrease, as then there were 10,569 Polish-language speakers in the territory of present Slovakia.

===Spain===

The Polish minority in Spain numbers between 45,000 and 60,000. The Polish population is mainly guest workers who took advantage of Spain&#x27;s economic boom during the 1990s. Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, San Sebastian and Valencia have significant Polish populations. The Polish minority in Spain is relatively young, 74% are between 20 and 49 years old.

===Sweden===
During World War II, the Polish resistance, in cooperation with Polish outposts in Sweden, organized escapes of Poles from German-occupied Poland to Sweden by sea.

Like only the United Kingdom and Ireland, Sweden let Poles work in the country once Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The number of Poles in Sweden has been estimated to be around 118,558 people, 100,706 of who were born in Poland and 17,852 with both of their parents being born in Poland. Poles are thus Sweden&#x27;s fifth-largest immigrant group, after Finns, Iraqis, former Yugoslavs (Bosnians, Croats, Serbs) and Syrians. Most of them are guest workers who have been invited to Sweden since 1990 by contracts with the Swedish government. Most Polish residents live in Stockholm, and the rest live south of the city, toward the Baltic Sea. Historically, Poland and Sweden had some cultural exchange.

===Switzerland===
Like the Polish community of Finland, some Polish diasporans from Germany were come from the Rhine-Ruhr basin, as immigrant workers to Switzerland. The biggest Polish diaspora community lives in Northern Switzerland.

===Turkey===
In 1842, Prince Adam Czartoryski founded the village of Adampol for Polish immigrants who came to Turkey after the failed November Uprising. The village still exists and is now called Polonezköy (Turkish for &quot;Polish Village&quot;). It is the main centre of the small but historic Polish community in Turkey. The Polish minority in Turkey has been estimated to be around 4,000 people. However, it is higher than the Turkish census indicates because of Turkified Poles who marry Turks. For example, Leyla Gencer&#x27;s mother was Atiye Çeyrekgil, who was born Alexandra Angela Minakovska and converted to Islam after the death of her husband. Also, Nazım Hikmet Ran&#x27;s mother, Ayşe Celile Hanım, was a descendant of Mustafa Celaleddin Pasha, who was born as Konstantin Borzecki in 1826. He immigrated to Ottoman Empire after Greater Poland Uprising and embraced Islam in 1848. He later became an Ottoman General and died in 1876.

===Ukraine===
According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, 144,130 Poles were residing in the country.

Poles began settling in the territory of present Ukraine in the 14th century, after Red Ruthenia had become part of the Kingdom of Poland. The number of Poles in Ukraine gradually increased over the centuries, but after World War II, it drastically decreased, as a result of the Soviet mass deportation of the Poles in Ukraine to Siberia and other eastern regions of the USSR as well as a campaign of ethnic cleansing, which was carried out in the early 1940s by Ukrainian nationalists in the western part of the country (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia). There was a Polish Autonomous District near Zhytomyr that was created in 1926, but it was disbanded in 1935 and its Polish inhabitants were either murdered or deported to Kazakhstan. The majority of those who survived the war in Ukraine were forcibly deported to the former eastern territories of Germany after Poland was shifted to the west by the Allied Potsdam Agreement after World War II.

===United Kingdom===

It was only after the First World War that Poles settled in large numbers in London – many from the Prisoner of War camps in Alexandra Palace and Feltham. During the Second World War many Poles came to the United Kingdom as political émigrés and to join the Polish Armed Forces in the West being recreated there. When the Second World War ended, a Communist government was installed in Poland and was hostile to servicemen returning from the West. Many soldiers refused to return to Poland, and around 150,000, after occupying resettlement camps, later settled in the UK. The Polish Government in London was not dissolved until 1991 when a freely elected president took office in Warsaw.

After Poland entered the European Union in May 2004, Poles gained the right to work in some other EU countries. While France and Germany put in place temporary controls to curb Central European migration, the United Kingdom (along with only Sweden and Ireland) did not impose restrictions. Many young Poles have come to work in the UK since then.
Estimates for the total number of people now living in the UK and born in Poland or of Polish descent vary significantly. There were an estimated 831,000 Polish-born residents in 2015 and one million by 2017. Other than London, Poles have settled in Southampton in Hampshire, Manchester, Bolton and Bury in Greater Manchester and Chorley in Lancashire. There are also large concentrations in Bradford, Leeds, Coventry and Nottingham, as well as South Yorkshire, South Wales, Herefordshire, Rugby, Banbury, Slough, Redditch and Swindon.

The economic crisis in the UK and the growing economy in Poland reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK. By the last quarter of 2008, it was claimed by the IPPR that up to half of those that had come to the UK to work may have returned home. However, the 2011 UK Census also indicates that it was probably never true.

According to the UK Office for National Statistics, Poland had overtaken India as the most common overseas country of birth for foreign-born people living in the United Kingdom in 2015.

==North America==

The United States and Canada were the major focus of Polish political and economic migration since 1850 up until the fall of the Iron Curtain and Poland&#x27;s accession into the EU.

===Canada===

<doc id="554733" wikidata="Q1190696" url="?curid=554733" title="War of the Oranges">
<text>The War of the Oranges (; ; ) was a brief conflict in 1801 in which Spanish forces, instigated by the government of France, and ultimately supported by the French military, invaded Portugal. The war resulted in the Treaty of Badajoz, the loss of Portuguese territory, in particular losing Olivenza to Spain. Six years later, Napoleon would invade both Portugal and Spain in the Peninsular War.

== Background ==
In 1800, First Consul Bonaparte and his ally, the Spanish prime-minister and Generalissimo Manuel de Godoy, sent an ultimatum to Portugal, the last British ally on the continent, demanding that she break her alliance with Britain. Portugal refused to cede, and, in April 1801, French troops arrived in the country. They were bolstered by Spanish troops under the command of Manuel de Godoy. Godoy had, under his command, the Spanish Army of Extremadura, with five divisions.

==War==
The Spanish attack on Portugal started on the early morning of 20 May, and focused on the Portuguese border region that included the main garrison town of Elvas and the smaller fortified towns of Campo Maior, Olivença (&quot;Olivenza&quot; in Spanish) and Juromenha. The main force of the Spanish Army advanced to Elvas, while two divisions advanced to Campo Maior and another division advanced to Olivença and Juromenha. Without having their fortifications complete and defended only by a few hundred soldiers, most of the militias, Olivença and nearby Juromenha quickly surrendered to the Spanish forces. The Portuguese garrison of Campo Maior - under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dias Azevedo - resisted the assault for 17 days, forcing the Spanish to maintain two entire divisions in its siege. The main Spanish force - under the direct command of Godoy - tried to assault Elvas but was easily repelled by the strong Portuguese garrison commanded by General Francisco de Noronha. The Spanish troops then withdrew to a safe distance from the fortress, with Godoy not daring to attack it again until the end of the war. The war entered in a stalemate, with most of the Spanish forces held in sieges of fortresses and the rest not being able to face the blockade made by the main core of the Portuguese Army, in order to advance further inside Portugal. Despite this, Godoy picked oranges from the outside of Elvas and sent them to the Queen of Spain, Maria Luisa, allegedly his lover, with the message that he would proceed to Lisbon. Thus, the conflict became known as the &quot;War of the Oranges&quot;.

==Peace==
On 6 June 1801 Portugal agreed to the tenets of the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal agreed to close its ports to English ships, to give commercial concessions to France, to cede Olivenza to Spain and to pay an indemnity. On 29 September 1801 Portugal agreed to both maintaining the tenets of the Treaty of Badajoz and the alterations made to it, which were all embodied within the Treaty of Madrid.

In response, from July 1801 until the signing of the Peace of Amiens in 1802, a British force of 3,500 men under Colonel William Henry Clinton occupied the Portuguese island of Madeira in the North Atlantic Ocean. Intended to forestall any French or Spanish attack on the island, the occupation took place with the tacit consent of the Portuguese.

==Aftermath==
After the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, in which the Franco-Spanish fleet lost to Britain, the government of Portugal restored relations with its old ally. This led France to declare the Peace of Badajoz treaty cancelled, again marching on Portugal and invading it, starting the Peninsular War, that lasted from 1807 to 1814.

The French invasion forced the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1807, with Rio de Janeiro becoming the capital of the Portuguese Monarchy. From Rio de Janeiro, the Portuguese monarch denounced the Treaty of Badajoz as having been signed under coercion, declaring it &quot;null and ineffective&quot;.

Later on, the Treaty of Vienna - signed by Spain in 1817 - stated clearly that the winning countries are to &quot;endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivença to Portuguese authority&quot;.

After the Napoleonic Wars, and the Congress of Vienna, neither Spain nor Portugal gave back the territories acquired both in America (Eastern Missions) and the Peninsula (Olivença); the latter remaining an issue with the Portuguese government (see Question of Olivença).

<text>William Hill (fl. 1630s) was the Proprietary Governor of the Province of Avalon in Newfoundland from 1634 to 1638. He was appointed to the position by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore had founded the colony and acted as its governor and Cecil Calvert had managed the colony after his father&#x27;s death but since he was occupied with the Province of Maryland appointed Hill as governor in his stead. Hill remained in the colony, living in Lord Baltimore&#x27;s house, until the arrival of Sir David Kirke in 1638. Kirke had been granted a Royal Charter over all of Newfoundland and forced Hill to vacate the house and move across the harbour where he stayed until his death.

<doc id="554748" wikidata="Q1092578" url="?curid=554748" title="Cinsaut">
<text>Cinsaut or Cinsault ( , ) is a red wine grape whose heat tolerance and productivity make it important in Languedoc-Roussillon and the former French colonies of Algeria, Lebanon, and Morocco. It is often blended with grapes such as Grenache and Carignan to add softness and bouquet.

It has many synonyms, of which perhaps the most confusing is its sale as a table grape called &#x27;Oeillade&#x27;, although it is different from the &quot;true&quot; Oeillade which is no longer cultivated. In South Africa, it was known as &quot;Hermitage&quot;, hence the name of its most famous cross Pinotage.

==History==

Cinsaut appears to be an ancient variety that may have originated in the Hérault, but could equally have been brought by traders from the eastern Mediterranean.

==Distribution and wines==

===Algeria===
Cinsaut is popular in Algeria for its drought resistance, and is used to make large volumes of wine.

===Australia===
Cinsaut is grown under a variety of names such as Black Prince, Blue Imperial, Oeillade and Ulliade.

===Chile===
Old Cinsault vines in the Itata Valley have recently been rediscovered by quality wine producers in Chile, such as Miguel Torres, Clos de Fous, Ventisquero and Undurraga. In one of the southernmost wine-producing areas of the country, the grape yields light-bodied, fruit-driven wines, most often varietal, but sometimes blended with Pais or Carignan.

===France===
Cinsaut is the fourth most widely planted grape variety in France, and is especially important in Languedoc-Roussillon. It is also widely used for rosé wines in Provence.

===Italy===

Known as Ottavianello, there is one tiny DOC devoted to Cinsaut - Ostuni Ottavianello, with a total production of less than 1000 cases a year. However, Cinsaut has long been used in Apulian blends and has also begun to attract the attention of winemakers interested in reviving old varieties.

===Lebanon===
Cinsaut is an important component in the blend of Lebanon&#x27;s Chateau Musar.

===Morocco and Tunisia===
As in Algeria, Cinsaut is popular in Morocco and Tunisia for its drought resistance.

===South Africa===
A lot of Cinsaut is grown in South Africa, much of which is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon. It holds a special place in the country&#x27;s viticulture alongside Pinot noir as one of the parents of Pinotage. Of all the grape varieties planted in the Cape, Cinsault has claimed a significant &quot;Cinderella&quot; turnaround in recent history. Historically, it was favored for its heat tolerance and productivity to be used in bulk blends but winemakers of late have been experimenting with the grape. Many new labels can be found on the market offering crunchy red berry flavors at low alcohols, it is still a very useful blending component with other Rhone varietals, while also adding some fruity brightness to Cabernet Sauvignon.

===United States===
The oldest continuous Cinsaut vineyard is said to be the Bechtold vineyard in Lodi, California, which was planted in 1886 by Joseph Spenker.

Some Cinsaut is planted in California as Black Malvoisie.

Cinsaut is planted in the North Coast AVA and Sierra Foothills AVA in California, most specifically in the Red Hills Lake County AVA and the El Dorado AVA respectively.

Cinsaut is planted in the Yakima Valley AVA in Washington.

Cinsaut is planted in Texas, specifically in the Texas High Plains A.V.A.

==Vine and Viticulture==
The vine can produce heavy crops, but wines are much better if yields are controlled. Cinsaut is very drought resistant but can be susceptible to disease, so appreciates a dry climate. It produces large cylindrical bunches of black grapes with fairly thick skins.

==Synonyms and confusion with other grapes==
Black Malvoisie, Blue Imperial, Bourdales Kek, Budales, Calibre, Chainette, Cincout, Cinq-sao, Cinquien, Cinsanet, Cinsault, Cubilier, Cubillier, Cuviller, Espagne, Espagnol, Froutignan, Grappu De La Dordogne, Hermitage, Malaga Kek, Marocain, Maurange, Mavro Kara Melkii, Milhau, Morterille noire, Moustardier Noir, Navarro, Negru De Sarichioi, Oeillade noire, Ottavianello, Ottaviano, Ottavianello, Pampous, Papadou, Passerille, Pedaire, Picardan noir, Piquepoul D&#x27;Uzes, Pis De Chevre, Plant D Arles Boudales, Plant D&#x27;Arles, Plant De Broqui, Plant De Broquies, Poupe De Crabe, Pousse De Chevre Rouge, Prunaley, Prunelas, Prunella, Prunellas noir, Salerne, Samsó, Samson, Senso, Sensu, Sinsó, Strum, Takopulo Kara, Ulliaou, West&#x27;s White Prolific, Black Prince, Boudales, Oeillade, Picardin noir and Ulliade.

While Cinsault is known under the synonym &quot;Oeillade noire&quot;, especially when it is sold as a table grape, it is not related to the Languedoc and Provence wine grape Oeillade noire.

<text>New Day Rising is the third studio album by the American punk rock band Hüsker Dü. It was released in 1985 through SST Records.

==Musical style==
As with its predecessor, &quot;New Day Rising&quot; continued to deviate from the fast-paced hardcore punk style of the band&#x27;s earliest releases, showing an evolution towards slower tempos and more melody. According to music journalist Andrew Earles, it expanded the more pop-oriented tracks from &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; into an entire body of work. Specifically, he cited the tracks &quot;Chartered Trips&quot;, &quot;Something I Learned Today&quot;, and &quot;First of the Last Calls&quot; from the previous album as having informed this album&#x27;s sound. The album&#x27;s sound has been described as &quot;scratchy and raw.&quot; Some of the album&#x27;s material is classified as pop punk. According to their late producer Spot, &quot;[the band was] kind of working from within a classic pop structure [...] and doing something else with it. Kind of like they broke into it with a coat hanger and got the keys out and went on a joy ride. And then wore the tires out.&quot; According to Ryan Bray of &quot;Consequence&quot;, &quot;&quot;Zen Arcade&quot; before it made some great strides toward helping melody coexist on the same turf as hardcore, [and] then &quot;New Day Rising&quot; marked the point where the band found the balance between coarse aggression and pop rock sweetness.&quot; Mould tracked guitars using Ibanez Flying V guitars.

==Production and release==
The band released the album &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; through SST Records in July 1984, and the label&#x27;s co-owner Joe Carducci immediately requested another album. The band wanted to self-produce, but SST insisted on Spot, who produced many of the label&#x27;s albums, including all of Hüsker Dü&#x27;s. The recording atmosphere was thus tense. Mould drank copious amounts of alcohol during the album&#x27;s recording process. He said, &quot;I was coming to the end of my drinking time and was realizing I wasn’t the easiest person to be around at times. [...] I could be a fully functioning yet contrary alcoholic at 23 or 24. So songs like I Apologize are clearly me feeling like a bad young man, like I should apologise globally for something I probably did but was not fully aware of because I was drunk a lot.&quot;

&quot;New Day Rising&quot; appeared in January 1985 and featured slower, more melodic material, continuing the trend away from the fast hardcore punk of the band&#x27;s earliest releases. This coupled with the higher-quality musicianship and production led fans to perceive the band as more commercial, and the band defended themselves against accusations of selling out.

The album cover features a photograph by band member Grant Hart, showing dogs in the water at Hidden Beach in Minneapolis, now known as Cedar Lake East Beach.

==Release==
&quot;New Day Rising&quot; was released in January 1985 by SST Records. The album charted on the UK Independent Album Charts, peaking at 10th place.

==Reception==

From contemporary reviews, &quot;Spin&quot; compared the album favourably to the group&#x27;s previous album &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; which was referred to as &quot;ambitious but overreaching&quot; and praised the songwriting, noting that &quot;these new songs could go up against anything on the radio and blow it away&quot; and that the group has &quot;developed into brilliant pop songwriters.&quot; The review concluded that despite producer Spot&#x27;s &quot;characteristically cheap production&quot;, the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t just fulfill the enormous promise of the Minneapolis trio. It fulfills the even greater promise of punk rock&quot;, and that the album &quot;affirms everything that was good about punk in the first place&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album an A rating, opining that it was &quot;clearly their finest record&quot; and that audiences should &quot;Play loud—this is one band that deserves it.&quot;

The album was included in end of the year best-of lists, such as the &quot;NME,&quot; who placed the album at ninth place on their list of top albums of 1985. The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Jon Pareles placed &quot;New Day Rising&quot; at third on his best albums of 1985 list.

From retrospective reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;[o]ccasionally, the razor-thin production and waves of noise mean that it takes a little bit of effort to pick out the melodies, but more often the furious noise and melodies fuse together to create an overwhelming sonic force&quot;, and that Hart and Mould &quot;both turn in songs that are catchy, clever, and alternately wracked with pain or teeming with humor. &quot;New Day Rising&quot; is a positively cathartic record and ranks as Hüsker Dü&#x27;s most sustained moment of pure power.&quot;

==Aftermath and influence==

&quot;New Day Rising&quot; was ranked thirteenth in &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. In 2014, it was ranked fifty-first in Spin&#x27;s &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album #495 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2012 pushed it up to rank 488, saying, &quot;The Hüskers created a roar like garbage trucks trying to sing Beach Boys songs&quot;, with the album again being ranked number 428 in the 2020 edition. The magazine also included the title track in its &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs&quot; list, ranking it at 96. &quot;PopMatters&quot; included the album on their list of &quot;12 Essential Alternative Rock Albums from the 1980s&quot;, saying &quot;&quot;New Day Rising&quot; was Hüsker Dü&#x27;s first full-blown alterna-rock record. It&#x27;s an album that captures a thoroughly road-tested band in its prime, one invigorated by its discovery of how to balance melody, noise, passion, and power without diminishing any of those aspects&quot;.

<doc id="554755" wikidata="Q609591" url="?curid=554755" title="Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)">
<text>Commonwealth is a term used by two unincorporated territories of the United States in their full official names, which are the Northern Mariana Islands, whose full name is &quot;Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands&quot;, and Puerto Rico, which is named &quot;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot; in English and &quot;Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico&quot; in Spanish, translating to &quot;Free Associated State of Puerto Rico.&quot; The term was also used by the Philippines during most of its period under U.S. sovereignty, when it was officially called the &quot;Commonwealth of the Philippines&quot;.

The definition of &quot;commonwealth&quot; according to 2013 United States Department of State policy, as codified in the department&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Affairs Manual&quot;, reads: &quot;The term &#x27;Commonwealth&#x27; does not describe or provide for any specific political status or relationship. It has, for example, been applied to both states and territories. When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states, the term broadly describes an area that is self-governing under a constitution of its adoption and whose right of self-government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by the U.S. Congress.&quot;

==Current commonwealths==
===Commonwealth of Puerto Rico===
Of the current U.S. insular areas, the term was first used by Puerto Rico in 1952 as its formal name in English (&quot;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot;). The formal name in Spanish for Puerto Rico is &quot;Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico&quot; (). The United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the Spanish–American War. In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 81-600) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention, and in 1952, the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island. Puerto Rico&#x27;s political relationship with the U.S. has been a continuing source of debate in Puerto Rico, the United States Congress, and the United Nations. The issue revolves around whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state, or become an independent country. The debate has spawned several referendums, presidential executive orders and bills in the U.S. Congress. Ultimately the U.S. Congress is the only body empowered to decide the political status of Puerto Rico, as stated under the Territorial Clause.

Despite the Spanish translation of the term &quot;commonwealth&quot;, Puerto Rico&#x27;s relationship with United States is not a Compact of Free Association (which is the case for the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands). As sovereign states, these islands have full right to conduct their own foreign relations, while the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States.

The territory was organized by the Foraker Act in 1900, which was amended by the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917. The drafting of the Constitution of Puerto Rico by its residents was authorized by Congress in 1951, and the result approved in 1952. The government of Puerto Rico has held several referendums with the options of U.S. statehood, independence, and commonwealth; the commonwealth option won on multiple plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998. In 2012, 54% of the voters did not wish to continue the present territorial status. Of the non-territorial statuses, becoming a U.S. state got 61.16% of the votes, Sovereign Free Associate State got 33.34% and Independence got 5.49%. In 2017, 97.18% voted overwhelmingly for statehood, with 1.5% for independence or free association and 1.32% for maintenance of the territorial status. The unusually high percentage of votes for statehood was attributed to a boycott led by the pro-status quo Popular Democrats, leading to a very low turnout of 22.93%, mainly made up of pro-statehood voters.

In 2020, there were only two options on the ballot. 52.52% of voters favored Puerto Rico&#x27;s immediate admission to the Union and 47.48% voted against it, with a 54.72% turnout.

Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship and vote for a resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, with voice but without vote, in the United States House of Representatives. With the exception of federal employees (such as employees of the United States Postal Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and servicemembers in all branches of the military) and people who earn their income from outside of the U.S. territories, residents of Puerto Rico generally do not pay federal income taxes, but are required to pay all other federal taxes (such as Social Security and Medicare) and Puerto Rico has no representation in the Electoral College that ultimately chooses the U.S. president and vice president.

Puerto Rico has sports sovereignty, with its own national team at the Olympics and at other international competitions. Puerto Rico also participates in different international organizations such as the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) (associate member), the Organization of Ibero-American States (full member), and the Ibero-American Summit (associate member).

===Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands===
In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated &quot;Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States&quot;. Prior to November 28, 2009, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) did not apply in the CNMI. Rather, a separate immigration system existed in the CNMI. This system was established under the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (&quot;Covenant&quot;), which was signed in 1975 and codified as 48 U.S.C. § 1801. The covenant was unilaterally amended by the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA) approved by the U.S. Congress on May 8, 2008, thus altering the CNMI&#x27;s immigration system, making the Immigration and Nationality Act the applicable immigration law of CNMI.

Transition to U.S. Immigration Law began November 28, 2009 in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). CNMI&#x27;s immigration laws have been replaced by the INA and other U.S. immigration laws.

===Representation in Congress===
U.S. insular areas are not afforded direct representation in the federal legislature, either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives.

Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that each U.S. state is entitled to two senators, but makes no provision for representation of insular areas in the Senate.

Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution apportions seats in the House of Representatives among the U.S. states by population, with each state being entitled to at least one representative, but makes no provision for representation of insular areas in the House. Insular areas are, however, afforded limited representation in the House by a delegate who may vote in committee but not on the House floor.

==Former commonwealth==
===Commonwealth of the Philippines===
The Commonwealth of the Philippines was an insular area that used &quot;Commonwealth&quot; in its official name, &quot;Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands&quot;, from November 15, 1935 until July 4, 1946. The United States recognized the then-future independence of the Philippines in 1934 but called for a ten-year transitional period.

<doc id="554757" wikidata="Q205640" url="?curid=554757" title="Vinnie Vincent">
<text>Vincent John Cusano (born August 6, 1952), better known by his stage name Vinnie Vincent, is an American guitarist. He is a former member of the rock band Kiss from 1982 until mid-1984 during the band&#x27;s transition out of their 1973–1983 makeup period. Vincent was the last member to wear a unique makeup/costume configuration, as the character of The Ankh Warrior (a design created by Paul Stanley), until he and the band were first shown without the makeup during an interview on MTV in September 1983. He founded his own band, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, which had minor hits in the hair metal genre.

== Early life ==
Vincent John Cusano was born on August 6, 1952 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the son of Theresa &quot;Terri&quot; (Ferraro) (1930–2021) and Alfonso Cusano, musicians. Both of his parents were of Italian descent. He picked up the guitar at an early age and was inspired by bluegrass and rock and roll. Cusano&#x27;s first introduction to working with internationally renowned artists was working with Felix Cavaliere (mostly widely known from The Rascals and their hit &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; ⁠&quot;) as part of the band &quot;Treasure&quot;. This resulted in an album of the same name being released on Epic Records in 1977. It was recorded in New York City at Sound Ideas recording studios In 1980, Vincent moved to Los Angeles, California where he became a staff songwriter for the television series &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;. Many of the series songs were written on Vincent&#x27;s acoustic guitar while sitting at the Cunninghams&#x27; kitchen table on the &quot;Happy Days&quot; set, during off-time from the show&#x27;s rehearsal schedule. Vincent has said the times of working at the Paramount lot were genuinely &quot;happy days&quot;. According to the site &quot;Kiss Related Recordings&quot;, Vincent has played with Dan Hartman as well as the bands Hunter, Warrior, Hitchhikers and Heat going as far back as 1970.

== Career ==
=== Kiss ===

After being introduced to the band by songwriter Adam Mitchell, Vincent was brought in as the replacement for guitarist Ace Frehley. Vincent&#x27;s personality meshed well with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, thus enabling him to play lead guitar on six of the nine tracks on the &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; album as well as co-writing three. After a commercially disappointing Creatures of the Night/Tenth Anniversary tour, that finished on a high at what ended up being the &quot;last&quot; makeup show (and Kiss&#x27; largest crowd attendance) at Maracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Vincent returned to the studio with Kiss to record the &quot;Lick It Up&quot; album. His work was productive, yielding eight co-writes out of the ten songs on the album (a record for any member until Bruce Kulick&#x27;s nine out of 12 on &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; and Stanley&#x27;s 10 out of 13 on &quot;Monster&quot;).

Though contributing to &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; as a session player before being named as Frehley&#x27;s replacement in December 1982, Vincent, for all the public knew, was the official guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar tracks on &quot;Lick it Up&quot;. In what was a frequent occurrence for former guitarist Frehley, a &quot;ghost player&quot; was asked to play on the album, with Rick Derringer recording the solo on the opening track.

Though Vincent performed well live with Kiss, he refused to sign an employment contract which strained the relationship with Simmons/Stanley. This arose because of disputes over his role in the band and pay (some reports indicated that Vincent had asked for, and was denied, a percentage of the band&#x27;s gross profits). Consequently, Vincent never formally became a member of the band. This ultimately led to him leaving after the North American leg of the &quot;Lick It Up&quot; tour. He was replaced by Mark St. John. Despite parting on bad terms, Vincent reconnected with Kiss years later as a songwriter on the 1992 album &quot;Revenge&quot;, contributing to the songs &quot;Unholy&quot;, &quot;Heart Of Chrome&quot; and &quot;I Just Wanna&quot;. Vincent again fell out of favor with Simmons and Stanley, as they claimed that Vincent again began &quot;making all kinds of crazy demands and pulling the same kind of crazy stuff all over again&quot;.

In 2022, Kiss released a super deluxe multi disc version of the &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; album, which featured demos and outtakes with Vincent as guitarist and songwriter, as well as two full CDs of live recordings from the Creatures of the Night/10th Anniversary Tour, the first officially released live recordings with Vinnie Vincent.

=== Vinnie Vincent Invasion ===
Following his departure from Kiss in mid-1984, Vincent used the money he made from his tenure in the band to take a long vacation, traveling the world for a full year and visiting places like Tahiti, Philippines, Mozambique, India, and Europe, including a visit to the small town of Mora in Dalarna, Sweden. That same year Vincent was hospitalized for mental health related issues, and also wrote songs and recorded demos of six new songs intended for Kiss with drummer Hirsh Gardner Then he formed the band Vinnie Vincent Invasion with, among others, former Journey singer Robert Fleischman in the mid-1980s and released two studio albums: &quot;Vinnie Vincent Invasion&quot; in 1986 and &quot;All Systems Go&quot; in 1988. The band broke up in 1989. After that, the band&#x27;s singer Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum formed Slaughter.

=== Later career ===
In 1996, Vincent released a solo EP from the studio sessions he did in 1990 (some say 1989–91), called &quot;Euphoria&quot;, once again with Robert Fleischman on vocals. Vincent, as well as playing all the guitars, played bass and did the drum programming under the guise of &quot;V. Meister”. Andre LaBelle provided drum tracks to the CD but they were replaced by Vincent&#x27;s drum programming. LaBelle can be heard on various tracks on the bootleg &quot;Guitarmaggedon/Guitars from Hell&quot; CD that featured five more songs than the &quot;Euphoria&quot; EP.

A tribute album entitled &quot;Kiss My Ankh: A Tribute to Vinnie Vincent&quot; was released by SplitScreen Entertainment on August 27, 2008. The album consists of new recordings of songs from Vincent&#x27;s careers with Kiss and the Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Featured artists include Steve Brown of Trixter, Troy Patrick Farrell of White Lion, T.J. Racer of Nitro, Mike Weeks of Robert Fleischman&#x27;s band, Sheldon Tarsha of Adler&#x27;s Appetite, Chris Caffery of Savatage and Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Ryan Roxie from the Alice Cooper band and rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, who performs a parody of the Kiss song &quot;Unholy&quot; (rewritten as a roast of Danger Danger vocalist Ted Poley).

=== Appearances in 2018–2023 ===

After 22 years of being off the radar, Vinnie Vincent agreed to appear at the 2018 Atlanta Kiss Expo in January. Vincent fulfilled his commitment and appeared at the sold-out expo, playing a four-song set including the live premiere of Kiss&#x27;s &quot;A Million to One&quot; from &quot;Lick It Up&quot; and a VVI song &quot;Back on the Streets&quot; where he was joined by original VVI vocalist Robert Fleischman. He said he considers Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley family, wishing them nothing but the best. After some e-mail exchanges with Gene Simmons, Vincent agreed to appear with Simmons on stage in April 2018 which was the first time they have met in person in over two decades. He also gave an exclusive interview to Eddie Trunk for Sirius XM, which was his first in over two decades, and held multiple question-and-answer sessions with fans.

On February 16, 2018, it was announced via Facebook that Vinnie would appear at the Days of the Dead convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in May 2018.

Vinnie Vincent&#x27;s first concert in 30 years was scheduled for December 7, 2018, at Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee. However these shows were postponed until February 8–9, 2019 in Nashville, before being canceled. These shows were promoted by Derek Christopher, who despite never having finalized or fulfilled a contract with Vincent, continued to sell tickets nevertheless. This left everyone wondering where the money went, and ultimately blamed Vincent.

Vincent then announced another show in Nashville called &quot;Speedball Jamm&quot;, which was scheduled for June 7, 2019. This show was ultimately canceled.

Two months later, Vincent hosted Vinnie Vincent&#x27;s Birthday Bash on August 10 in Nashville, TN, followed by Vinnie Vincent&#x27;s Merry Metal Christmas on December 14–15, 2019.

On May 22, 2022, Vinnie played for the first time live together with his lead guitar colleagues from Kiss, Ace Frehley and Bruce Kulick, performing a 4-song all Kiss set at Creatures Fest (hosted by Neil Davis, Brian Bell, Dale Walter) in Nashville.
In May 2023, Vincent held an album listening party, at Starstruck Studios. The upcoming album was well received; several bands opened for Vincent, and he played with backing band Leo Roriz of Sleeper Signal and Ben Hanz of Trixter.

== Personal life ==
Vincent was married to AnnMarie Peters (who went missing at age 43 on January 2, 1998, and was discovered murdered two years later), and has twin daughters with her, born 1982.

In 1996, Vincent married his second wife Diane Kero, a former girlfriend of Ace Frehley; Vincent and Kero had first met at a Kiss convention in Chicago the previous year. The two resided in Smyrna, Tennessee until her death from alcohol-related complications on January 13, 2014. She was 47 years old.

<text>Sir Charles Cavendish Boyle (29 May 1849 – 17 September 1916) was a British civil servant, magistrate, and colonial administrator who served as Colonial Governor of Newfoundland, Mauritius and British Guiana. He wrote the lyrics for the anthem of the Dominion and later Province of Newfoundland, &quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Known as Cavendish Boyle, he was born in Barbados into an ancient Irish family, the son of Capt. Cavendish Spencer Boyle and Rose Susan Alexander, daughter of Lt-Col. C. C. Alexander. He was the grandson of Sir Courtenay Boyle and the great-grandson of the Seventh Earl of Cork and Earl of Orrery. His elder brother, Sir Courtenay Edmund Boyle, was also a civil servant who served as Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade.

Boyle was educated in London at Charterhouse, and later studied colonial administration and law.

==Career==

Boyle joined the British Colonial Office and was made magistrate in the Leeward Islands in 1879. He served as Colonial Secretary of Bermuda from 1882 to 1888 and in Gibraltar from 1888 to 1894. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint John (CMG) in 1889, and granted a knighthood in the same order in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours.

In 1894 he moved to British Guiana, where he was Government Secretary and acted as Governor several times.

In March 1901, he was appointed Governor of Newfoundland, where he arrived in St. Johns in mid-June. He stayed as such until 1904, and wrote poems to the island&#x27;s rugged beauty including the &quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot; which was adopted as the dominion&#x27;s national anthem. As governor, Boyle donated a trophy, the Boyle Challenge Cup, to the Newfoundland Hockey League.

He continued his colonial career with a posting as the 19th Governor of Mauritius from 20 August 1904 to 10 April 1911, after which he retired to Brighton, England.

==Personal life==
In 1914, Boyle married to Louise Judith Sassoon , daughter of Reuben David Sassoon (1835-1905). They had no children. He died in London in 1916 after undergoing an operation. His widow, who was 25 years his junior, lived to be 90, dying in 1964.

<text>Milton Mesirow (November 9, 1899 – August 5, 1972), better known as Mezz Mezzrow, was an American jazz clarinetist and saxophonist from Chicago, Illinois. He is remembered for organizing and financing recording sessions with Tommy Ladnier and Sidney Bechet. He recorded with Bechet as well and briefly acted as manager for Louis Armstrong. Mezzrow is equally known as a colorful character, as portrayed in his autobiography, &quot;Really the Blues&quot; (which takes its title from a Bechet composition), co-written with Bernard Wolfe and published in 1946.

==Music career==
According to one biographer: &quot;As a juvenile delinquent, [Mezzrow] was in and out of reformatory schools and prisons where he was exposed to jazz and blues music. He began to play the clarinet and decided to adopt the African American culture as his own. He became a ubiquitous figure on the Chicago jazz scene of the 1920s and ran in the circles of musicians that included King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Jimmy Noone, Al Jolson, Baby Dodds, Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Bellson and many others. [He] was an advocate for the pure New Orleans jazz style.&quot;

Along with other white musicians of his era, such as Eddie Condon and Frank Teschemacher, Mezzrow visited the Sunset Café in Chicago to learn from, and listen to, Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five. He admired Armstrong so much that after the release of &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot;, he, along with Teschemacher, drove 53 miles to Indiana in order to play the song for Bix Beiderbecke.

Mezzrow&#x27;s first recordings were released in 1933, under the band name Mezz Mezzrow And His Orchestra. The group was composed primarily of black musicians such as Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Pops Foster, and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, but also included the Jewish trumpet player Max Kaminsky. During the 1930s and 1940s, Mezzrow organized and took part in many recording sessions with Sidney Bechet. These recordings, by the Mezzrow-Bechet Quintet and Mezzrow-Bechet Septet, featured black musicians such as Frankie Newton, Sammy Price, Tommy Ladnier, Sidney Catlett, and Pleasant Joe, plus Art Hodes, who was born in Ukraine. Mezzrow&#x27;s 1938 sessions for the French jazz critic Hugues Panassié involved Bechet and Ladnier, and helped spark the &quot;New Orleans revival&quot;. He also played on six recordings by Fats Waller in 1934.

In the mid-1940s, Mezzrow started his own record label, King Jazz Records, featuring himself with groups, usually including Sidney Bechet and often including the trumpeter Oran &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Page.

He appeared at the 1948 Nice Jazz Festival, following which he made his home in France and organized many bands that included French musicians including Claude Luter and visiting Americans, such as Buck Clayton, Peanuts Holland, Jimmy Archey, Kansas Fields and Lionel Hampton. With ex-Count Basie trumpeter Buck Clayton, he made a recording of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;West End Blues&quot; in Paris in 1953.

His total recorded output amounts to almost 150 sides, all of which were also collected and re-released on various albums. Despite this lengthy and successful career, the record producer Al Rose was critical of Mezzrow&#x27;s musicianship, saying that in his opinion &quot;he wasn&#x27;t a very good clarinetist,&quot; while praising him for his willingness to help other musicians in need and citing &quot;his generosity and his total devotion to the music we call jazz.&quot;

==Personal life==

Milton Mesirow was ethnically and religiously Jewish, and was raised in Chicago. His wife, Johnnie Mae, was a black Baptist. They had one son, Milton Mesirow, Jr. According to the younger Mesirow, the surname &quot;Mezzrow&quot; was a &quot;pen name&quot; of his father&#x27;s. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2015, &quot;Mezz Jr.&quot;, as he was known, told a reporter: &quot;My father put me in a shul, and my mother&#x27;s side tried to make me a Baptist. So when I&#x27;m asked what my religion is, I just say &#x27;jazz.&#x27;&quot;

Mezzrow praised and admired African-American culture and style. In his autobiography, &quot;Really the Blues&quot;, he wrote that from the moment he heard jazz he &quot;was going to be a Negro musician, hipping [telling] the world about the blues the way only Negroes can.&quot; Eddie Condon said of him (in &quot;We Called It Music&quot;, London; Peter Davis 1948): &quot;When he fell through the Mason–Dixon line he just kept going&quot;.

The family lived in Harlem, New York City, where Mezzrow declared himself a &quot;voluntary Negro&quot; and was listed as Negro on his draft card in World War II. He believed that &quot;he had definitely &#x27;crossed the line&#x27; that divided white and black identities&quot;.

Mezzrow became known as much for his cannabis advocacy as his music. In his time, he was so well known in the jazz community for selling marijuana that &quot;&quot; became slang for marijuana, a reference used in the Stuff Smith song, &quot;If You&#x27;re a Viper&quot;. He was also known as the Muggles King, the word &quot;muggles&quot; being slang for marijuana at that time; the title of the 1928 Louis Armstrong recording &quot;Muggles&quot; refers to this. Armstrong was one of his biggest customers. A letter from 1932, written by Armstrong, demonstrates this relationship; while in England, Armstrong detailed in this letter about where and how Mezzrow should send marijuana.

In 1940, he was arrested in possession of sixty joints while trying to enter a jazz club at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, with intent to distribute. When he was sent to jail, he insisted to the guards that he was black and was transferred to the segregated prison&#x27;s black section. In &quot;Really the Blues&quot;, he wrote:
Mezzrow was lifelong friends with the French jazz critic Hugues Panassié and spent the last 20 years of his life in France. He was preceded in death by his wife, Johnnie Mae Mezzrow, and was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The couple were survived by their son Mezz Jr.

In 2015, a Greenwich Village jazz club called Mezzrow was named in his honor.

<doc id="554775" wikidata="Q233642" url="?curid=554775" title="Second Anglo-Maratha War">
<text>The Second Anglo-Maratha War (from 1803 –1805) was a large conflict within the Maratha Confederacy involving the British East India Company. It resulted in major loss of territory for the Marathas, including regions around Delhi and in present-day Gujarat falling into direct Company rule.

==Background==
The British had supported the Peshwa Raghunathrao in the First Anglo-Maratha War, and they continued with his son, Baji Rao II. Though not as martial in his courage as his father, the son was &quot;a past master in deceit and intrigue&quot;. Coupled with his &quot;cruel streak&quot;, Baji Rao II soon provoked the enmity of Yashwant Rao Holkar when he had one of Holkar&#x27;s relatives killed.

The Maratha Empire at that time consisted of a confederacy of five major chiefs: the Peshwa (Prime Minister) at the capital city of Poona, the Gaekwad chief of Baroda, the Scindia chief of Gwalior, the Holkar chief of Indore, and the Bhonsale chief of Nagpur. The Maratha chiefs were engaged in internal quarrels among themselves. Lord Mornington, the Governor-General of British India had repeatedly offered a subsidiary treaty to the Peshwa and Scindia, but Nana Fadnavis refused strongly.

In October 1802, the combined armies of Peshwa Baji Rao II and Scindia were defeated by Yashwantrao Holkar, ruler of Indore, at the Battle of Poona. Baji Rao fled to British protection, and in December the same year concluded the Treaty of Bassein with the British East India Company, ceding territory for the maintenance of a subsidiary force and agreeing to treaty with no other power. The treaty would become the &quot;death knell of the Maratha Empire&quot;.

==War==

This act on the part of the Peshwa, their nominal overlord, horrified and disgusted the Maratha chieftains; in particular, the Scindia rulers of Gwalior and the Bhonsale rulers of Nagpur and Berar contested the agreement.

The British strategy included Maj. Gen. Arthur Wellesley securing the Deccan Plateau, Lt. Gen. Gerard Lake taking Doab and then Delhi, Powell entering Bundelkhand, Murray taking Badoch, and Harcourt neutralizing Bihar. The British had available over 53,000 men to help accomplish their goals.

With the logistic assembly of his army complete (24,000 men in total) Wellesley gave the order to break camp and attack the nearest Maratha fort on 8 August 1803. On the same day he took the walled Pettah of Ahmednagar (town adjacent to the fort) by escalade.

The Ahmednagar Fort surrendered on 12 August after an infantry attack had exploited an artillery-made breach in the wall. With the pettah and fort now in British control Wellesley was able to extend control southwards to the river Godavari.

In September 1803, Scindia forces lost to Lake at Delhi and to Wellesley at Assaye. On 18 October, British forces took the of Asirgarh Fort with a loss of two killed and five wounded. The fort&#x27;s garrison subsequently surrendered on the 21st after the attackers had erected a battery. British artillery pounded ancient ruins used by Scindia forces as forward operating bases, eroding their control. In November, Lake defeated another Scindia force at Laswari, followed by Wellesley&#x27;s victory over Bhonsle forces at Argaon (now Adgaon) on 29 November 1803.

==Conclusion==
On 17 December 1803, Raghoji II Bhonsale of Nagpur signed the Treaty of Deogaon in Odisha with the British after the Battle of Argaon and gave up the province of Cuttack (which included Mughal and the coastal part of Odisha, Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, Balasore Port, parts of Midnapore district of West Bengal).

On 30 December 1803, the Daulat Scindia signed the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon with the British after the Battle of Assaye and Battle of Laswari and ceded to the British, Hisar, Panipat, Rohtak, Rewari, Gurgaon, Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat and the fort of Ahmmadnagar.

The British started hostilities against Yashwantrao Holkar on 6 April 1804. Yashwantrao was somewhat successful as he harassed the British forces by guerilla warfare. However, he didn&#x27;t receive the expected help from Scindia who had already signed a treaty with the British. He went to Punjab and sought Ranjeet Singh&#x27;s help with no success. The lack of resources compelled him to come to terms with British.

The Treaty of Rajghat, signed on 24 December 1805, forced Holkar to give up Tonk, Rampura, and Bundi to the British.

<text>Mark Leslie Norton (February 7, 1956 – April 5, 2007), better known as Mark St. John, was an American guitarist best known for his brief stint with the hard rock band Kiss from April to November 1984. His work can be heard on the band&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Animalize&quot; and their 2023 live album &quot;Off the Soundboard: Poughkeepsie, NY&quot;. After leaving Kiss, he co-founded the band White Tiger.

St. John died suddenly under murky circumstances in early April 2007, several months after being badly beaten during a brief stay in an Orange County jail.

==Career==
===Pre-Kiss===
Prior to joining Kiss in 1984, St. John worked as a teacher and played guitar in a Southern California cover band called Front Page.

===Kiss===

Guitar maker Grover Jackson helped St. John get in touch with Paul Stanley in early 1984. He was selected as Kiss&#x27; new lead guitarist after an audition, and he subsequently signed a five-year contract with the band, replacing Vinnie Vincent. St. John would ultimately be with Kiss for only seven months, with his work being featured on the 1984 album &quot;Animalize&quot;, the second album of Kiss&#x27; post-makeup era. St. John&#x27;s only video appearance with Kiss was in the video for the hit single &quot;Heaven&#x27;s on Fire&quot;.

During the mid-1984 recording sessions for &quot;Animalize&quot;, St. John clashed with his new bandmates frequently. Drummer Eric Carr said later that &quot;as soon as he joined the band we knew that there was a problem&quot;, even before he had played his first live show with Kiss. The guitarist was &quot;over-qualified&quot; according to Carr, and his talent caused him to behave arrogantly in the studio. Gene Simmons had asked St. John to record a bass part and Carr later remarked to him that he thought one of the notes sounded wrong. St. John&#x27;s furious reaction left Simmons extremely unimpressed, and Carr &quot;wanted to kill Mark&quot; following the incident. Simmons and Stanley took St. John aside following the outburst and made it clear that such behavior would not be tolerated. Stanley said that, additionally, they had tremendous difficulty writing and recording guitar solos for &quot;Animalize&quot;, with St. John often being unable to play the same thing twice if a second take was required.

Kiss issued a press release stating that St. John had developed severe reactive arthritis and was unable to play guitar. Bruce Kulick would serve as his temporary replacement for the opening European leg of the &quot;Animalize World Tour&quot;. St. John rejoined Kiss shortly after the band returned to America. It was at this point that he was instructed to watch the shows and learn the dynamics of the &quot;Animalize&quot; live show, in order for Stanley and Simmons to be able to smoothly insert him into the show.

St. John made his live debut with Kiss on November 27, 1984, in Baltimore, Maryland. Kulick played the first five songs of the show, with St. John later taking the stage to play five songs, with Kulick then returning to finish the show. St. John and Kulick appeared together at the end of the show, bowing with the rest of the band members. The following day, St. John played his first full show with the band on November 28, 1984, in Poughkeepsie, New York. This show was later released as a &quot;KISS: Off the Soundboard&quot; live album in April 2023. Finally, on November 29, 1984, St. John played his final full concert with Kiss, in Binghamton, New York. Following these shows, it quickly became apparent that Kulick was a more natural fit for Kiss than was St. John. As a result, he was let go on December 7, 1984, after a Kiss concert in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Kulick was announced as Kiss&#x27; new permanent lead guitarist the next day.

St. John later confessed that his medical condition had been a cover story, saying &quot;The arthritis thing was really a cover up for the other reasons, you know what I&#x27;m trying to say?&quot;

St. John is the only member of Kiss not to appear on any album front cover, as the &quot;Animalize&quot; cover features only a tapestry of animal prints. However, he is posing with the rest of the band on the album&#x27;s back cover.

===After Kiss===
In January 1985 St. John teamed up with vocalist David Donato and drummer Barry Brandt of Angel to work on developing some demo ideas. By March he was playing live again, appearing at an all-star jam session at the FM Station Club. The lineup included Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge (Kiss Revolution, April/May 1985). St. John also performed at a sold-out audience at a benefit jazz concert for Greenpeace. Some of the musicians playing alongside St. John included the Steve Hooks Band, Stu Nevitt (Shadowfax), Slyde Hyde (Tom Scott/Supertramp), Al Aarons (Count Basie), plus other special all-star guests.

St. John and Donato soon formed White Tiger. They had written most of the material for the album by mid-1985 and set out to complete a lineup with which to record. The band also included St. John&#x27;s younger brother, Michael, on bass, but was completed with the addition of Brian James Fox on drums. While the independent release did well on that level selling some 50,000 copies, and the band gigged around California, White Tiger joined up with Garry Lane owner of Logic Productions who promoted many top bands in LA. St. John and Lane became good friends meeting for a second time at Trojan Studios in Garden Grove, California. That is where St. John and Lane came up with the idea to play the legendary club known as The Hot Spot located in Huntington Beach, California, owned by Gennie Gromet (who was the ex-wife of Dick Dale from the band Dick Dale and the Del-Tones). The band did not manage to break and split while working on demos for a second album in 1988. St. John teamed up with Jeff Scott Soto in 1988 to make a demo. St. John also did some session work performing lead guitar on &quot;Livin&#x27; for My Lord&quot; on Ken Tamplin&#x27;s 1990 album, &quot;Axe to Grind&quot;. Tamplin is an inspirational Christian rocker more famed for his involvement in the band Shout. Tamplin has also co-written material with Gene Simmons of Kiss. St. John also worked with former &quot;Knight Rider&quot; star David Hasselhoff, even appearing in his video, &quot;Is Everyone Happy&quot;.

St. John made a demo in 1990 with fellow former Kiss member Peter Criss. This band, known as the Keep, became what was essentially White Tiger, with Criss replacing Brian Fox on drums, and David Donato replacing original vocalist David MacDonald. This lineup performed live just once, on May 2, 1990, at a drum clinic at the Guitar Center music store in Lawndale, California.

When the band started shopping their demo (credited as Peter Criss) around the response was universally negative. One cassette demo to circulate simply featured &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, &quot;Long Time&quot;, and &quot;All Night Long&quot;, though they had also covered Lee Michaels&#x27; 1971 hit &quot;Do You Know What I Mean&quot;, and had other original material such as &quot;Between the Lines&quot;. By early 1991, the difficulty shopping the demo, and St. John&#x27;s need to get on with making a living, led to friction between Criss and him, and he left the band (which eventually became Criss).

He was in a short-lived band with Phil Naro called the Mark St. John Project that released a limited edition EP in 1999, and he also made an appearance at a Kiss expo in New Jersey. He later released an all-instrumental CD in 2003 called &quot;Magic Bullet Theory&quot;, which would be his final recorded material released in his lifetime.

In later years, St. John did not make many public appearances. In 2023 Kiss announced they would release the only known full live show recording featuring St. John as part of their &quot;Off the Soundboard&quot; series of live albums. The show was recorded on November 28, 1984, at Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York.

==Declining health and death==
Beginning on September 14, 2006, St. John was incarcerated for several days at Theo Lacy Jail in Orange County, California, after being charged with possession of unspecified drug paraphernalia, attempted destruction of evidence, and resisting arrest. He was initially housed at the facility&#x27;s D Barracks, a medium-security dormitory for nonviolent offenders. He was later moved to F-West Barracks after telling guards he had stolen crackers from another inmate&#x27;s property box and was in fear for his safety. A guard allegedly conspired with a group of inmates to have St. John assaulted for the transgression, and subsequently St. John was brutally beaten and stabbed with pencils by a group of up to 20 inmates. The guard was later placed on paid leave pending an investigation into this and other violent incidents inside the jail. In an interview with the &quot;OC Weekly&quot;, a fellow inmate described St. John&#x27;s encounter: 
He got caught stealing something. I guess he did that somewhere else in the jail, but we found out about it somehow. . . . The Kiss guy got beat up pretty bad.
His girlfriend, who said he was unrecognizable after the vicious beating, believed the incident was directly responsible for his untimely death several months later. A couple of days before the beating, St. John told her that he had &quot;snitched&quot; on a drug dealer several years earlier, and he believed he was certain to be attacked if this became known by the other inmates.

For the next several months after leaving Theo Lacy Jail, St. John suffered severe headaches and body aches and many times told his girlfriend that the chronic ailments were absolutely the result of the beating at Theo Lacy. While it is not known what medical attention he received inside the jail, after his release he refused to see a doctor due to having no medical insurance, and thus his health deteriorated. St. John died on April 5, 2007, due to what the coroner described as a brain hemorrhage brought on by an accidental overdose of methamphetamine.

Friends claimed that St. John was never the same after the beating and would not discuss his brief time at Theo Lacy Jail. Another friend stated that St. John fell deep into depression and drug addiction after being released, selling all his stage outfits, and mowing lawns and doing roofing to afford a drug habit that spiraled out of control.

<doc id="554790" wikidata="Q2607896" url="?curid=554790" title="Henry Arthur Blake">
<text>Sir Henry Arthur Blake (; 8January 184023February 1918) was an Irish-born British colonial administrator who held the governorships of six British colonies over the course of his career.

==Early life, family and career==
Blake was born in Limerick, Ireland. He was the son of Peter Blake of Corbally Castle (c. 1805 – bur. St. Ann&#x27;s, Dublin, 19 November 1850), a Galway-born county Inspector of the Irish Constabulary, and wife (m. Mobarnan, County Tipperary) Jane Lane (Lanespark, County Tipperary, 5 March 1819 – ?), daughter of John Lane of Lanespark, County Tipperary, and paternal grandson of Peter Blake of Corbally Castle, County Galway (? – 1842, bur. Peter’s Well, County Galway) and wife (m. 14 May 1800) Mary Browne, daughter of The Hon. John Browne and wife Mary Cocks and paternal granddaughter of John Browne, 1st Earl of Altamont, and wife Anne Gore. He was included among the descendants the Blakes of Corbally Castle, Kilmoylan, County Galway, the descendants of Peter Blake (? – 1712), who was granted the lands of Corbally, Kilmoylan, County Galway, on 20 December 1697, and wife Magdeline Martin, &quot;the Blakes&quot;. Peter Blake was a son of Sir Richard Blake and wife Gyles Kirwan.

Blake started out as a clerk in the Bank of Ireland but lasted only 18 months before resigning and commencing a cadetship in the Irish Constabulary in 1857. He became a special inspector two years later. In 1876, he was appointed Resident Magistrate to Tuam, an especially disturbed district in the west of Ireland, where he was noted as judicious and active. In 1882, he was promoted to Special Resident Magistrate.

==Early colonial services==
In 1884, Blake was made Governor of Bahamas, a position he held until 1887. He was appointed to Queensland in 1886 but resigned without entering the administration, following an imbroglio between Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Knutsford, and the premier of Queensland, Sir Thomas M&#x27;Ilwraith, on the appointment. In 1887, he moved to Newfoundland, where he was governor until the end of 1888, being knighted on 7 November that year. In 1889 he became the Captain-General and Governor of Jamaica. His term was extended in 1894 and 1896, at the request of Legislature and public bodies of the island, until 1897.

==Governor of Hong Kong==
On 25 November 1898, Blake was appointed Governor of Hong Kong, a position he held until November 1903. Five months before he arrived in Hong Kong, the British government negotiated an agreement with the Qing government which leased the New Territories to British Hong Kong for 99 years. During his tenure, Blake sent in colonial administrators to the New Territories to assert control over the local &quot;punti&quot; clans. The clans resisted the British takeover of the New Territories, resulting in the outbreak of the Six-Day War; a largely Indian force under the command of British Army officer William Gascoigne managed to defeat the &quot;punti&quot; clans, with Blake adopting an amiable co-operation policy to prevent further trouble and allowed them to retain traditional laws and customs in regards to land inheritance, land usage and marriage.

Blake left Hong Kong immediately after he attended the laying of the foundation stone of the Supreme Court building (Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1985 to 2011) on 12 November 1903.

==Post-Hong Kong==
Blake was appointed Governor of Ceylon at the end of his tenure in Hong Kong in 1903, and he served in that capacity until 1907. This was his last post in the Colonial Service. A freshly retired Blake impressed George Morrison with his bitterness at not landing a Privy Council sinecure in gratitude for his 41 years&#x27; public service.

The Blakes retired to Myrtle Grove in Youghal, County Cork, where they both died and were buried.

==Personal life==

Blake married twice: Jeannie Irwin in 1862 (she died in 1866), and Edith Bernal Osborne in Ireland, on 7 February 1874 (she was the daughter of MP Ralph Bernal Osborne). He had two sons, and one daughter Olive, who married John Bernard Arbuthnot. During his period as Governor of The Bahamas, a watercolour of his three children, &quot;Children Under a Palm&quot;, was painted by Winslow Homer. The painting was subsequently featured on the BBC TV programme, &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot;

==Honours and arms==

* Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), 1888
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), 1897

==Legacy==
The community of Blaketown in Canada was named in his honour when he was the governor of Newfoundland. Blake Garden, Blake Pier (卜公碼頭) and Blake Block (now within the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Headquarters) are named after him.

The &quot;Bauhinia blakeana&quot;, discovered in Hong Kong around 1880, was named after him (Blake shared his wife&#x27;s interest in botany). It became an emblem of Hong Kong in 1965 and has been the official emblem from 1 July 1997. It appears on the flag of Hong Kong and its currency.

The John Crow Mountains in Jamaica were renamed the Blake Mountains in 1890 but the name did not stick.

<text>The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1819) was the final and decisive conflict between the British East India Company and the Maratha Confederacy in India. The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of Maratha territory by British East India Company troops, and although the British were outnumbered, the Maratha army was decimated. The troops were led by Governor General Hastings, supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop. Operations began against the Pindaris, a band of Muslim mercenaries and Marathas from central India.

Peshwa Baji Rao II&#x27;s forces, supported by those of Mudhoji II Bhonsle of Nagpur and Malharrao Holkar III of Indore, rose against the East India Company. They attemped to regain the power that was taken away by the British due to the Treaty of Bassein. Pressure and diplomacy convinced the fourth major Maratha leader, Daulatrao Scindia of Gwalior, to remain neutral even though he lost control of Rajasthan.

British victories were swift, resulting in the breakup of the Maratha Empire and the loss of Maratha independence. Several minor battles were fought by the Peshwa&#x27;s forces to prevent his capture.

The Peshwa was eventually captured and placed on a small estate at Bithur, near Kanpur. Most of his territory was annexed and became part of the Bombay Presidency. The Maharaja of Satara was restored as the ruler of his territory as a princely state. In 1848 this territory was also annexed by the Bombay Presidency under the doctrine of lapse policy of Lord Dalhousie. Bhonsle was defeated in the battle of Sitabuldi and Holkar in the battle of Mahidpur. The northern portion of Bhonsle&#x27;s dominions in and around Nagpur, together with the Peshwa&#x27;s territories in Bundelkhand, were annexed by British India as the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories. The defeat of the Bhonsle and Holkar also resulted in the acquisition of the Maratha kingdoms of Nagpur and Indore by the British. Along with Gwalior from Shinde and Jhansi from the Peshwa, all of these territories became princely states acknowledging British control. The British proficiency in Indian war-making was demonstrated through their rapid victories in Khadki, Sitabuldi, Mahidpur, and Satara.

==The Marathas and the British==

The Maratha Empire was founded in 1674 by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj the Bhosle dynasty. Shivaji Maharaj&#x27;s capital was located at Raigad. Shivaji Maharaj successfully defended his empire from attacks by the Mughal Empire and his Maratha Empire went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the &quot;Ashta Pradhan&quot; (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the &quot;Peshwa&quot; or the &quot;Pant Pradhan&quot; (prime minister). 

===Growing British power===
While the Marathas were fighting the Mughals in the early 18th century, the British held small trading posts in Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. The British fortified the naval post of Mumbai after they saw the Marathas defeat the Portuguese at neighbouring Vasai in May 1739. In an effort to keep the Marathas out of Mumbai, the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty. The envoys were successful, and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the British East India Company rights to free trade in Maratha territory. In the south, the Nizam of Hyderabad had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas. In reaction to this, the Peshwa requested support from the British, but was refused. Unable to see the rising power of the British, the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts. Despite the lack of support, the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years.

During the period 1750–1761, British defeated the French East India Company in India, and by 1793 they were firmly established in Bengal in the east and Madras in the south. They were unable to expand to the west as the Marathas were dominant there, but they entered Surat on the west coast via the sea.

The Marathas marched beyond the Indus as their empire grew. The responsibility for managing the sprawling Maratha empire in the north was entrusted to two Maratha leaders, Shinde and Holkar, as the Peshwa was busy in the south. The two leaders did not act in concert, and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands. They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders. A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against a combined Muslim force that gathered defeating Marathas led by the Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali. An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield as a result of that conflict. However, between 1761 and 1773, the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north.

===Anglo-Maratha relations===
The Maratha gains in the north were undone because of the contradictory policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in the family of the Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.

The treaty set off discussions amongst the British in India as well as in Europe because of the serious implications of a confrontation with the powerful Marathas. Another cause for concern was that the Bombay Council had exceeded its constitutional authority by signing such a treaty. The treaty was the cause of the start of the First Anglo-Maratha War. This war was a Maratha victory and almost a stalemate, with no side strong being able to completely defeat the other. The war concluded with the treaty of Salabai in May 1782, mediated by Mahadji Shinde. The foresight of Warren Hastings was the main reason for the success of the British in the war. He had destroyed the anti-British coalition and created a division between the Shinde, the Bhonsle, and the Peshwa.

The Marathas were still in a very strong position when the new Governor General of British controlled territories Cornwallis arrived in India in 1786. After the treaty of Salabai, the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north. The British and the Marathas enjoyed more than two decades of peace, thanks to the diplomacy of Nana Phadnavis, a minister in the court of the 11-year-old Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. The situation changed soon after Nana&#x27;s death in 1800. The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in Pune in 1801, since the Peshwa sided with Shinde. The Peshwa Baji Rao II fled Pune to safety on a British warship. Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the treaty of Bassein. This made Peshwa effectly become a client ruler of the British.

In response to the treaty, the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked the British, refusing to accept the betrayal of their sovereignty to the British by the Peshwa. This was the start of the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803. Both were defeated by the British, and all Maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to the British.

=== Maratha-Hyderabad Relations ===
In 1762, Raghunathrao allied with the Nizam due to mutual distrust and differences with Madhavrao Peshwa. The Nizam marched towards Poona, but little did he know that Rughunathrao was going to betray him. In 1763, Madhavrao I along with Raghunathrao defeated the Nizam at the Battle of Rakshasbhuvan and signed a treaty with the Marathas. In 1795, he was defeated by Madhavrao II&#x27;s Marathas at the Battle of Kharda and was forced to cede Daulatabad, Aurangabad and Sholapur and pay an indemnity of Rs. 30 million. A French general, Monsieur Raymond, served as his military leader, strategist and advisor.

The Battle of Kharda took place in 1795 between the Nizam and the Maratha Confederacy, in which the Nizam was badly defeated. Governor General John Shore followed the policy of non-intervention despite the Nizam being under his protection which led to the loss of trust of the British. This was the last battle fought together by all the Maratha chiefs under leadership of Bakshibahadur Jivabadada Kerkar. The Maratha forces consisted of cavalry, including gunners, bowmen, artillery and infantry. After several skirmishes, the Nizams infantry under Raymond launched an attack on the Marathas but Scindia forces under Jivabadada Kerkar defeated them and launched a counterattack which proved to be decisive. The rest of the Hyderabad army fled to the fort of Kharda. The Nizam started negotiations and they were concluded in April 1795.

===The British East India Company===
The British had travelled thousands of miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages to deal with the Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it was not going to be shaken for years to come.

The British believed that a new permanent approach was needed to establish and maintain continuous contact with the Peshwa&#x27;s court in Pune. The British appointed Charles Malet, a senior merchant from Bombay, to be a permanent Resident at Pune because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the region.

==War preparations==
The Maratha Empire had partly declined due to the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Efforts to modernize the armies were half-hearted and undisciplined: newer techniques were not absorbed by the soldiers, while the older methods and experience were outdated and obsolete. The Maratha Empire lacked an efficient spy system, and had weak diplomacy compared to the British. Maratha artillery was outdated, and weapons were imported. Foreign officers were responsible for the handling of the imported guns; the Marathas never used their own men in considerable numbers for the purpose. Although Maratha infantry was praised by the likes of Wellington, they were poorly led by their generals and heavily relied on Arab and Pindari mercenaries. The confederate-like structure that evolved within the empire created a lack of unity needed for the wars.
At the time of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline. The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and the Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa&#x27;s minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.

The British seized the opportunity to force Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Poona) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle&#x27;s guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.

===Maratha planning===

The Peshwa disbanded his cavalry, but secretly asked them to stand by, and offered them seven months&#x27; advance pay. Baji Rao entrusted Bapu Gokhale with preparations for war. In August 1817, the forts at Sinhagad, Raigad, and Purandar were fortified by the Peshwa. Gokhale secretly recruited troops for the impending war. Many Bhils and Ramoshis were hired. Efforts were made to unify Bhonsle, Shinde, and Holkar; even the mercenary Pindaris were approached. The Peshwa identified unhappy Marathas in the service of the British Resident Elphinstone and secretly recruited them. One such person was Jaswant Rao Ghorpade. Efforts were made to secretly recruit Europeans as well, which failed. Some people, such as Balaji Pant Natu, stood steadfastly with the British. Several of the sepoys rejected the Peshwa&#x27;s offers, and others reported the matter to their superior officers. On 19 October 1817, Baji Rao II celebrated the Dassera festival in Pune, where troops were assembled in large numbers. During the celebrations, a large flank of the Maratha cavalry pretended they were charging towards the British sepoys but wheeled off at the last minute. This display was intended as a slight towards Elphinstone and as a scare tactic to prompt the defection and recruitment of British sepoys to the Peshwa&#x27;s side. The Peshwa made plans to kill Elphinstone, despite opposition from Gokhale. Elphinstone was fully aware of these developments thanks to the espionage work of Balaji Pant Natu and Ghorpade.

Maratha powers were estimated at 81,000 infantry, 106,000 horse or cavalry and 589 guns. Of these the Peshwa had the highest number of cavalry at 28,000, along with 14,000 infantry and 37 cannon. The Peshwa headquarters was in Pune. Holkar had the second largest cavalry, amounting to 20,000, and an infantry force supplemented with 107 artillery units. Shinde and Bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry, artillery and infantry. Holkar, Shinde and Bhonsle were headquartered in Indore, Gwalior and Nagpur respectively. The Afghan leader Amir Khan was located in Tonk in Rajputana and his strength was 12,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and 200 guns. The Pindaris were located north of the Narmada valley in Chambal and Malwa region of central India. Three Pindari leaders sided with Shinde, these were Chitu, Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammad. They led horsemen with strengths of 10,000, 6,000 and 4,000 but most were armed only with spears. The rest of the Pindari chiefs, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu and Bapu were allied with Holkar. Tulsi and Imam Baksh each had 2,000 horsemen, Kadir Baksh, 21,500. Sahib Khan, Nathu and Bapu had 1,000, 750 and 150 horsemen.

===British planning===
The East India Company viewed the killing of their envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, as definitive intent by the Peshwa to undermine British control over the Maratha, and operations were commenced in order to place the entire region effectually into the possession of the Company. Although some regard the war as a mopping-up operation of the earlier Second Anglo-Maratha war, historians note the fact that the British assembled the largest army they had ever at that time organised in India indicated the importance the British placed on defeating the Maratha. The army, numbering roughly 120,000 men, consisted of the Grand Army or Bengal Army under the command of the Marquess of Hastings, and the Army of the Deccan under General Hislop. This included over 60 battalions of Native Infantry, multiple battalions derived from British regiments, numerous sections of cavalry and dragoons, in addition to artillery, horse artillery and rocket troops, all armed with the most modern weapons and equipped with highly organised supply lines.

This massive force quickly induced Shinde, who was secretly planning with the Peshwa and the Nepal Ministry to form a coalition against the British, into coming to terms with the British. In early November 1817, he was forced to enter into a treaty in which he ceded all his armed forces and major forts. Amir Khan disbanded his army on condition of being guaranteed the possession of the principality of Tonk in Rajputana. He sold his guns to the British and agreed to prevent predatory gangs from operating from his territory. By these actions, the British kept two major allies of the Maratha out of the war before any hostilities had begun.

==Major events of the war==
===Conflict in Pune and the pursuit of Baji Rao II===

The war began as a campaign against the Pindaris, but the first battle occurred at Pune where the Peshwa, Baji Rao II, attacked the under-strength British cantonment on 5 November 1817. The Maratha forces comprised 20,000 cavalry, 8,000 infantry, and 20 artillery guns whereas the British had 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 infantry, and eight artillery units. What followed was the Battle of Khadki where the Maratha were initially successful in creating and exploiting a gap in the British lines, but were soon nullified by the advance of the British infantry, which firing volley after volley, caused the Maratha to retreat in a matter of four hours. The British soon claimed victory with the loss of 86 men compared to the 500 Maratha killed.
While Pune was surrendered to the British, the Peshwa and his forces fled first to Purandar and then toward the city of Satara. His commander-in-chief Bapu Gokhale organised the retreat to guard the Peshwa in flight. 
The Peshwa then fled to the town of Koregaon where the Battle of Koregaon (also known as the battle of Koregaon Bhima) took place on 1 January 1818 on the banks of the river Bhima, north west of Pune. Captain Stauton arrived near Koregaon along with 500 infantry, two six-pounder guns, and 200 irregular horsemen. Only 24 of the infantry were of European origin; they were from the Madras Artillery. The rest of the infantry was composed of Indian sepoys employed by the British. A fierce battle ensued that lasted the entire day. Streets and guns were captured and recaptured, changing hands several times. Although Baji Rao&#x27;s commander Trimabkji killed Lieutenant Chishom, the Marathas were forced to evacuate the village and retreated during the night. The British lost 175 men and about a third of the irregular horse, with more than half of the European officers wounded. The Marathas lost 500 to 600 men.

After the battle the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa continued his flight southward throughout the month of January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January the pursuit of the Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party. On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag.
On 19 February, General Smith got word that the Peshwa was headed for Pandharpur. General Smith&#x27;s troops attacked the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war. By 10 April 1818, General Smith&#x27;s forces had taken the forts of Sinhagad and Purandar. Mountstuart Elphinstone mentions the capture of Sinhagadh in his diary entry for 13 February 1818: &quot;The garrison contained no Marathas, but consisted of 100 Arabs, 600 Gosains, and 400 Konkani. The Qiladar was a boy of eleven; the garrison was treated with great liberality; and, though there was much property and money in the place, the Qiladar was allowed to have whatever he claimed as his own.&quot;

On 3 June 1818 Baji Rao surrendered to the British and negotiated the sum of eight lakhs as annual maintenance. Baji Rao obtained promises from the British in favour of the Jagirdars, his family, the Brahmins, and religious institutions. The Peshwa was sent to Bithur near Kanpur. While the downfall and banishment of the Peshwa was mourned all over the Maratha Empire as a national defeat, the Peshwa contracted more marriages and spent his long life engaged in religious performances and excessive drinking.

===Conflict with the Pindaris===

The Pindaris, who were mostly cavalry armed with spears, came to be known as the &quot;Shindeshahi&quot; and the &quot;Holkarshahi&quot; after the patronage they received from the respective Maratha leaders. The major Pindari leaders were Chitu, Karim Khan, and Wasil Mohammad and their total strength was estimated at 33,000. The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India and it was thought that this region was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable to support themselves on the land. In 1815, 25,000 Pindaris entered the Madras Presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on the Coromandel coast. Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817 and therefore Francis Rawdon-Hastings wanted the Pindaris extinguished.

In opposition to what the British forces expected as they entered the region in late 1817, they found that the Pindaris had not devastated the area. In fact the British found a super-abundance of food and forage, especially grain, which added immensely to the security of their supplies. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were surrounded and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris from the south and drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor-general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. With the principal routes from Central India being occupied by British detachments, the Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered in the course of a single campaign. Being armed only with spears, they made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them.

The Pindari forces proved unable to counter the British and the Pindari chiefs were soon reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. Karim and Chitu had still 23,000 soldiers between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces; defeat followed defeat. Many fled to the jungles, while others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by local villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings inflicted upon them by the Pindaris. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February 1818 and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape, and after he was found Mohammed committed suicide by imbibing poison. Chitu, another Pindari warrior, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.

===Events in Nagpur===

Mudhoji Bhonsle, also known as Appa Saheb, consolidated his power in Nagpur after the murder of his cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle, and entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and mostly armed with only matchlocks and swords. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.

The British Residency was to the west of the Sitabuldi Fort located close to Nagpur. The British East India Company troops occupied the north end of the hillock associated with the fort. The Marathas, fighting with the Arabs, made good initial gains by charging up the hill and forcing the British to retreat to the south. British commanders began arriving with reinforcements: Lieutenant Colonel Rahan on 29 November, Major Pittman on 5 December, and Colonel Doveton on 12 December. The British counterattack was severe and Appa Saheb was forced to surrender. A force of 5,000 Arabs and Hindustanis however remained secured within the walls of Nagpur with the British laying siege to the city from 19 December. Attempts by the British to breach the walls failed with the loss of over 300 men, of which 24 were Europeans. The British agreed to pay the defenders 50,000 rupees to abandon Nagpur, which they did on 30 December. A treaty was signed on 9 January 1818. Appa Saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions. Most of his territory, including the forts, was now controlled by the British. They built additional fortifications on Sitabuldi.

A few days later Appa Saheb was arrested. He was being escorted to Allahabad when he escaped to Punjab to seek refuge with the Sikhs. They turned him down and he was captured once again by the British near Jodhpur. Raja Mansingh of Jodhpur stood surety for him and he remained in Jodhpur, where he died on 15 July 1849 at 44 years of age.

===Events in Indore===


The Court of Holkar, based at Indore, was at this time practically nonexistent. The dynasty was headed by 11-year-old Malhar Rao Holkar III under the regency of his dead father&#x27;s mistress Tulsi Bai Holkar. Tulsi Bai was executed by her own troops in December 1817 for allying with the British; soon after, the British advanced into Holkar&#x27;s territory, encountering his army about 40 km north of Indore at the Battle of Mahidpur.

The battle of Mahidpur between Holkar and the British was fought on 21 December 1817, lasting from midday until 3:00 am. Lieutenant General Thomas Hislop was commander of the British forces which came in sight of the Holkar army at about 9:00 am. The British lost around 800 men but Holkar&#x27;s force was destroyed, with about 3,000 killed or wounded. These losses effectively knocked the Holkar out of the conflict and broke the power of the Holkar dynasty. The Battle of Mahidpur also proved to be a major setback for the Marathas as well. Henry Durand wrote, &quot;After the battle of Mahidpur not only the Peshwa&#x27;s but the real influence of the Mahratta States of Holkar and Shinde were dissolved and replaced by British supremacy.&quot; The remnants of Holkar&#x27;s army were pursued across the territory by the British, suffering further casualties in small-scale skirmishes. Holkar was captured and his ministers made overtures of peace, and on 6 January 1818 the Treaty of Mandeswar was signed; Holkar accepted the British terms in totality. Large quantities of spoils of war was taken by the British, which remained an acrimonious issue for many years afterwards. Holkar came under British authority as a puppet prince subject to the advice of a British Resident.

==Operations against remaining Maratha forces==

By mid 1818, all of the Maratha leaders had surrendered to the British. Shinde and the Afghan Amir Khan were subdued by the use of diplomacy and pressure, which resulted in the Treaty of Gwalior on 5 November 1817. Under this treaty, Shinde surrendered Rajasthan to the British and agreed to help them fight the Pindaris. Amir Khan agreed to sell his guns to the British and received a land grant at Tonk in Rajputana. Holkar was defeated on 21 December 1817 and signed the Treaty of Mandeswar on 6 January 1818. Under this treaty the Holkar state became subsidiary to the British. The young Malhar Rao was raised to the throne. Bhonsle was defeated on 26 November 1817 and was captured but he escaped to live out his life in Jodhpur. The Peshwa surrendered on 3 June 1818 and was sent off to Bithur near Kanpur under the terms of the treaty signed on 3 June 1818. Of the Pindari leaders, Karim Khan surrendered to Malcolm in February 1818; Wasim Mohammad surrendered to Shinde and eventually poisoned himself; and Setu was killed by a tiger.

During the last stages of the conflict, from 1818 to 1819, British military operations switch to capturing Maratha-held forts which were still holding out under the command of their qiladars. On February 27, 1818, British forces under the command of Sir Thomas Hislop approached Thalner Fort, assuming it was friendly; the fort&#x27;s qilidar, Tulsiram Mama, ordered his troops to fire on the British, outraging Hislop who laid siege to the fort. After ordering several bombardments against the fort walls, he personally led a storming party which captured the fort and overwhelmed its garrison (which was composed mostly of Arab soldiers). Mama was tried and executed for perfidy, and was hung on a nearby tree. Other forts in the region, such as Naralla Fort and Malegaon Fort were gradually captured and occupied by the British. At Malegaon Fort, the British encountered unexpectedly strong resistance from the fort garrison, which led them to bring in a 2,600-strong reinforcement force consisting of a mixture of infantry and artillery, after which a storming party captured the fort.

In early 1819, almost all of the forts had been taken, with the lone holdout being Asirgarh Fort, which was under the command of qiladar Jeswant Rao Lar. In March of that year, a massive British contingent lay siege to Asirgarh, capturing and occupying the town next to the fort to serve as a temporary base of operations. The 1,200-strong garrison was subject to constant artillery bombardments before the British launched an assault, which led to the fort&#x27;s capture on 9 April. With the capture of Asirgarh Fort, the British victory was complete and all military operations ceased.

==Aftermath==
The war left the British, under the auspices of the British East India Company, in control of virtually all of present-day India south of the Sutlej River, either through direct British rule, or through princely states. The famed Nassak Diamond was seized by the Company as part of the spoils of the war. The British acquired large chunks of territory from the Maratha Empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition. The terms of surrender Malcolm offered to the Peshwa were controversial amongst the British for being too liberal: The Peshwa was offered a luxurious life near Kanpur and given a pension of about 80,000 pounds. A comparison was drawn with Napoleon, who was then confined to a small rock in the southern Atlantic and given a small sum for his maintenance. Trimbakji Dengale was captured after the war and was sent to the fortress of Chunarin Bengal where he spent the rest of his life. With all active resistance over, John Malcolm played a prominent part in capturing and pacifying the remaining fugitives.

The Peshwa&#x27;s territories were absorbed into the Bombay Presidency and the territory seized from the Pindaris eventually became the nucleus of the Central Provinces of British India. The princes of Rajputana were effectively reduced to feudal lords who accepted the British as the paramount power. Thus Hastings redrew the map of India to a state which remained more or less unaltered until the time of Lord Dalhousie. The British recognised Pratap Singh (Raja of Satara), a direct descendant of Shivaji as the ceremonial head of the Maratha Confederacy. Raghuji Bhonsle III, then not even ten years old, was appointed as the ruler of Nagpur under British guardianship. The Peshwa adopted a son, Nana Sahib, who went on to be one of the leaders of the Rebellion of 1857. After 1818, Mountstuart Elphinstone reorganized the administrative divisions for revenue collection, thus reducing the importance of the Patil, the Deshmukh, and the Deshpande.

The new government felt a need to communicate with the local Marathi-speaking population; Elphinstone pursued a policy of planned standardization of the Marathi language in the Bombay Presidency starting after 1820.

<text>The Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) was the top professional indoor soccer league in the United States. The league was a member of the United States Soccer Federation. The MISL had replaced the NPSL which folded in 2001. According to MISL.net, the league ceased operations as of May 31, 2008. &quot;We are considering structural changes that will bring us greater efficiencies, while also allowing long term growth and expansion of the League&quot;, said John Hantz, former Chairman of the MISL, and Owner/Operator of the Detroit Ignition. All the teams from MISL went to the new indoor leagues: NISL, MASL and the XSL. The NISL and XSL used the same playing rules as the MISL.

==History==
In the summer of 2001, the National Professional Soccer League disbanded. The six surviving teams organized the MISL as a single-entity structure similar to Major League Soccer. In 2002, the MISL absorbed two teams from the World Indoor Soccer League: the Dallas Sidekicks and San Diego Sockers. The St. Louis Steamers, another former WISL team, joined the league the following year. On May 27, 2008, Commissioner Steve Ryan stepped down as the commissioner of the MISL, and then on June 2, 2008, the Management Committee of the MISL announced they had ceased operations effective May 31, 2008 to reform the league. Following the league&#x27;s dissolution, all MISL&#x27;s teams from its final season joined either the National Indoor Soccer League, Professional Arena Soccer League, or the Xtreme Soccer League.

==Organization==
The MISL was organized in a single table playing a 30-game schedule. Traditionally, the season began in October and ended in March. The league also conducted an All-Star Game at midseason. It pitted Eastern teams against Western teams and USA All-Stars against World All-Stars as well as the MISL All-Stars against a Mexican team. No All-Star Game was played in the 2004–2005 and 2006–2007 seasons. The All-Star game scheduled for the 2007–08 season in Stockton, California was also canceled.

The top six teams qualified for the playoffs, which began in April. In the first round, the sixth place team played the third place team while the fourth and fifth place teams also played either other. The top two teams received a bye in the first round. The survivors of the first round played the top two seeds in the semifinals with the first place team playing the lowest surviving seed from the first round and the second place team playing the highest surviving seed. The two semi-final winners met in the MISL Championship Final. The first two rounds were a two-game series with a golden goal tie breaker. The Championship Final was a single game at a predetermined neutral site.

==Television==
The MISL had a relative lack of television coverage for being a national professional sports league. In February 2007, the league and Versus announced a partnership to deliver a nationally televised game of the week starting in March 2007. For the 2006–2007 season, Versus broadcast two regular season games, a MISL Championship Series Semifinal game on April 14, and the MISL Championship Series Final. Additionally, the MISL produced its first-ever live magazine show to preview the 2007 MISL Championship Series. Before the 2006–2007 season, national television coverage was limited to the MISL Championships in 2005 and 2006, which were shown on ESPN2.

For the 2007–08, the MISL signed an agreement with Fox Soccer Channel to televise 20 games that season.

In addition to national television, certain games were shown in local markets over local cable networks like CN8.

==Rules==
The MISL game was the standard North American version of indoor soccer. It was different from the FIFA-sanctioned futsal.

Each MISL game consisted of four 15-minute quarters. There were breaks between the first two and the last two quarters. There was also a 15-minute halftime. Ties resulted in consecutive 15-minute sudden death overtimes.

An MISL field was roughly the size of an ice hockey rink, measuring 200 feet by 80 feet. Goals measured 14 feet by 8 feet and are set into the boards. Players were allowed to bounce the ball off the dasher boards. Play stopped if the ball leaves the field of play.

During an MISL game, each team was allowed to have 6 players on the field at a time. One player was the goalkeeper who handled the ball while in the penalty arc. The other players were generally divided as two defenders, one midfielder, and two forwards. Substitution was unlimited and may happen &quot;on the fly&quot; during play.

Fouls and misconducts were generally the same as outdoor soccer with a few changes. First, all kicks were direct, with no whistle to restart play, which usually resulted in a &quot;quick start&quot;. Also, the MISL utilized blue cards in addition to the traditional yellow and red cards of outdoor soccer.

Blue cards were for fouls that earn possible two-minute power plays. Yellow cards were given for dissent, resulting in a 5-minute penalty but the offending team did not play short.

All red cards in the MISL resulted in a two-minute power play. Red cards were awarded for violent conduct or accumulation of cards (3 blues or 2 yellows).

Originally, the MISL had a multiple point scoring system where goals were worth 1, 2, or 3 points depending upon the distance that they were scored or game situation. The former WISL teams objected to this. After the 2003 Championship, the league began using a traditional one-point-per-goal rule because of a controversial goal scored during the deciding game. However, the league went back to multipoint scoring in 2006 with 2- and 3-point goals.

<text>Zoran &quot;Bata&quot; Mirković (, ; born 21 September 1971) is a retired Serbian footballer and current manager.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Mirković made his first appearance for FK Rad during the 1990–91 season. But even before that he and his teammates won the Yugoslav title in the under-21 category, the biggest success Rad ever had. Mirković spent three seasons in Rad as a professional player, and all together played 62 matches, scoring one goal. His talent didn&#x27;t go unnoticed by Partizan officials and they invited him to sign for Partizan. Mirković signed for Partizan and replaced the injured Blažo Pešikan.

In the first three years Mirković was with Partizan, he established himself as a player, became a first-choice player in the national team and won three titles (the double in 1993–94 followed by the league title in 1994–95. He wore the number 2 shirt and became a favourite of the Partizan fans because of his fighting spirit especially in derby matches against Red Star Belgrade. He was also a favourite because, in those difficult times (war and sanctions), he upheld his obligations towards Partizan and stayed for all three years stipulated in his contract. He played 82 matches for Partizan (26 in the 1993–94 season, 29 in the 1994–95 season and 27 in the 1995–96 season), scoring one goal.

Mirković spent two seasons with Atalanta. He got injured in the first match in Serie A league and had to take a three-month break. He played a role of midfielder/defender and his performance was so good that the then Juventus coach Marcello Lippi invited him to sign for Juventus. He was very popular among the Atalanta fans who were instrumental in convincing the club not to sell him to Fiorentina when that option seemed inevitable.

Mirković&#x27;s career in Juventus can be divided in two different periods. Under coach Lippi, Bata played 19 Serie A matches, scoring one goal. He also played UEFA Champions League matches. When Carlo Ancelotti took over in the spring of 1999, Mirković was no longer a first-choice Juve player, playing mostly Italian Cup matches.

In summer 2000, Mirković signed a three-year contract with Fenerbahçe. In his first season in Istanbul he won a Turkish League title and was a finalist in Turkish Cup. In his second season in Turkey he played Champions League and came second in Turkish League. His third season in Fenerbahçe was not so successful. Three coaches and problems in the club caused Fenerbahçe to end the season in the sixth place.

Then in January 2004, following a 6-month break from football, Mirković became a Partizan player once again, signing a contract for two and a half years. On 6 March 2006, Mirković announced his retirement due to a recurring back injury at the age of 34.

===International career===
Mirković was a first choice player for the national team of FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro where he usually played in the right-back position and wore the number 2 shirt. He played 59 matches with the senior national team. He was a participant in the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France but missed Euro 2000 because of a three-match ban following an incident in the last qualifying match, played against Croatia in Zagreb, where he grabbed Robert Jarni by the testicles and therefore was sent off. His final international was a June 2003 European Championship qualification match away against Azerbaijan.

==Post-playing career==
===Administrative career===
On 24 April 2007, Football Association of Serbia (FSS) appointed Mirković as sporting director of the national team, responsible for the A-squad and the under-21 squad. However, he quit by early December 2007, citing poor professional cooperation with the FSS leadership headed at the time by Zvezdan Terzić. FSS president Terzić (who would soon afterwards be indicted on embezzlement charges) commented on Mirković&#x27;s resignation as follows: &quot;Mirković is my mistake since I didn&#x27;t know him well enough as a person before I brought him into the FSS. He&#x27;s a wonderful person, but couldn&#x27;t manage to be a part of the system and even said so on several occasions to both myself and general secretary Zoran Laković&quot;.

Mirković was chosen as the vice-president of FK Partizan on 18 August 2008. He was vice-president for about a year when he resigned after Partizan&#x27;s early exit in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds.

===Managerial career===
Mirković began his managerial career as assistant coach of Sinđelić Belgrade in 2015 eventually being promoted to head coach in July 2015. He remained in that position until December 2015. In February 2016, he became the assistant coach of the Montenegrin national team where he worked directly with his former coach Ljubiša Tumbaković. He remained in that position until 4 August 2018 when he replaced Miroslav Đukić as head coach of Partizan. He was head coach of Partizan until abruptly resigning after a 1–0 loss to Voždovac on 10 March 2019.

==Personal life==
In May 2013, Mirković married Sanela Šaulić, daughter of singer Šaban Šaulić making Mirković the stepfather of Luka Adžić.

<text>The scythed chariot was a war chariot with scythe blades mounted on each side. It was employed in ancient times.

==History==
The scythed chariot was a modified war chariot. The blades extended horizontally for about to each side of the wheels. 

The Greek general Xenophon (430−354 BC), an eyewitness at the battle of Cunaxa, tells of them: &quot;These had thin scythes extending at an angle from the axles and also under the driver&#x27;s seat, turned toward the ground&quot;. Serrated bronze blades for chariot wheels have also been excavated from Zhou-era pre-imperial Chinese sites.

Dismissing completely 17th to 19th century ideas of a Canaanite, Assyrian, Indian or Macedonian origin, Historian Alexander K. Nefiodkin challenges Xenophon&#x27;s attribution of scythed chariots to the first Persian king Cyrus, pointing to their notable absence in the invasion of Greece (480−479 BC) by one of his successors, Xerxes I. Instead, he argues that the Persians introduced scythed chariots sometime later during the Greco-Persian Wars, between 467 BC and 458 BC, as a response to their experience fighting against Greek heavy infantry.

In addition, Nefiodkin has responded to the critic J. Rop, summarising that the ancient historian Ctesias of Assyria is unreliable, and that scythed chariots were developed in order to fight ancient Greek hoplite formations, or more generally, heavy infantry.

===Persian wars===

The scythed chariot was pulled by a team of four horses and manned by a crew of up to three men, one driver and two warriors. Theoretically the scythed chariot would plow through infantry lines, cutting combatants in half or at least opening gaps in the line which could be exploited. It was difficult to get horses to charge into the tight phalanx formation of the Greek hoplites (infantry). The scythed chariot avoided this inherent problem for cavalry by using the scythe 
to cut into the formation even when the horses avoided the men. A disciplined army could diverge as the chariot approached, and then re-form quickly behind it, allowing the chariot to pass without causing many casualties. War chariots had limited military capabilities. They were strictly an offensive weapon and were best suited against infantry in open flat country where the charioteers had room to maneuver. At a time when cavalry were without stirrups, and probably had neither spurs nor an effective saddle, though they certainly had saddle blankets, scythed chariots added weight to a cavalry attack on infantry. Historical sources come from the infantry side of such engagements i.e. the Greek and Roman side. Here is one recorded encounter where scythed chariots were on the winning side:

The soldiers had got into the habit of collecting their supplies carelessly and without taking precautions. There was one occasion when Pharnabazus, with 2 scythed chariots and about 400 cavalry, came on them when they were scattered all over the plain. When the Greeks saw him bearing down on them, they ran to join up with each other, about 700 altogether; but Pharnabazus did not waste time. Putting the chariots in front, and following behind them himself with the cavalry, he ordered a charge. The chariots dashing into the Greek ranks, broke up their close formation, and the cavalry soon cut down about a hundred men. The rest fled and took refuge with Agesilaus, who happened to be close at hand with the hoplites.
The only other recorded example of their successful use seems to be when units of Mithradates VI of Pontus defeated a Bithynian force on the River Amnias in 89 BC. (Appian)

===Roman encounters===

Despite these shortcomings, scythed chariots were used with some success by the Persians and the kingdoms of the Hellenistic Era. They are last known to have been used at the Battle of Zela in 47 BC. The Romans are reported to have defeated this weapon system, not necessarily at this battle, with caltrops. On other occasions the Romans fixed vertical posts in the ground behind which their infantry were safe (Frontinus &quot;Stratagems&quot; 2,3,17-18)
There is a statement in the Scriptores Historiae Augustae Severus Alexander LV that he captured 1,800 scythed chariots. This is universally regarded as false.

Late in the Imperial period, the Romans might have experimented with an unusual variant of the idea that called for cataphract-style lancers to sit on a pair or a single horse drawing a &quot;chariot&quot; reduced to a bare axle with wheels, where the blades were only lowered into the fighting position at the last moment. This would have facilitated manoeuvring before battle. This at least is a reasonable interpretation of the rather enigmatic &quot;De rebus bellicis&quot; section 12-14.

===Saharan tribes===
In the northern Sahara nomadic tribes called Pharusii and Nigrites used scythed chariots c. 22 AD, as Strabo reports:
&quot;They have chariots also, armed with scythes.&quot;

===Celtic Britain and Ireland===
Regarding the Roman conquest of Britain, contemporary Roman geographer Pomponius Mela mentions: 

They make war not only on horseback but also from 2 horse chariots and cars armed in the Gallic fashion – they call them covinni – on which they use axles equipped with scythes.
There is no accepted archaeological evidence concerning scythed chariots. There are some large heavy scythe blades from late Roman Britain which are too unwieldy for a man to use.

However, a scythed chariot appears in The Cattle-Raid of Cooley (Táin Bó Cúailnge), the central epic of the Ulster cycle of Early Irish literature.

===Leonardo da Vinci===

One of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s ideas was a scythed chariot.

<doc id="554818" wikidata="Q6407736" url="?curid=554818" title="Killing Mr. Griffin">
<text>Killing Mr. Griffin is a 1978 suspense novel by Lois Duncan about a group of teenaged students at a New Mexico high school, who plan to kidnap their strict English teacher, Mr. Griffin. Duncan developed the story from the character of Mark, who is involved in the kidnapping plan and is based on the first boyfriend of Duncan&#x27;s oldest daughter. Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a teacher one of Duncan&#x27;s daughters had in high school. In 2010, the novel was reissued with changes to modernize the content, making it more age appropriate and appealing to readers.

The book won several awards and honors, including the 1982 Massachusetts Children&#x27;s Book Award and the 1982–1983 Alabama Camellia Children&#x27;s Choice Book Award. &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; was adapted into a television film of the same name that aired on NBC on April 7, 1997. The film starred Jay Thomas, Amy Jo Johnson, Mario Lopez, and Scott Bairstow, and was first released on DVD and VHS on March 7, 2000.

==Plot==
Brian Griffin is a strict high-school English teacher at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who never accepts late homework and is demanding of his students. When Mark Kinney, one of the students in his class, plagiarizes a paper, Mr. Griffin makes him beg to be allowed back into the class. Instead of allowing him back in, though, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class he is repeating include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett, and Betsy Cline. Susan McConell is an A+ student on average, but is constantly receiving below-average B&#x27;s in his class. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they feel he has treated them poorly.

The group decides to use Susan, who is least willing to participate in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David, and Mark forcibly place a bag over Mr. Griffin&#x27;s head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, due to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme, and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg, but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.

Susan and David defy the group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead as a result of coronary arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces the rest of the group to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin&#x27;s car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin&#x27;s, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff&#x27;s garage, so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.

Mark&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has a picnic with her fiancé at the secluded place in the mountains, where they discover Mr. Griffin&#x27;s medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin&#x27;s body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died, as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David&#x27;s paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses to give it back to him, believing the ring to be that of David&#x27;s father, who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.

Susan plans to tell the police all that the group has done. Before she can inform the police, Mark, Jeff, and Betsy tie Susan up, and Jeff and Betsy leave to hide Mr. Griffin&#x27;s car. Mark sets her curtains on fire, but Susan is saved by Kathy Griffin, Mr. Griffin&#x27;s wife, who came over to her house with a detective for an interview. The detective catches Mark as he attempts to leave the house through a window. Several days later, Susan&#x27;s mother tells her that all of those involved will face varying criminal charges, with her lawyer attempting to get Susan off with no charges in exchange for testimony. Mark will face three trials, one each for the deaths of Mr. Griffin and David&#x27;s grandmother, and one for the attempted murder of Susan. Mrs. Griffin leaves Susan a note that her husband had written before his death, praising Susan for her work and recognizing her potential.

==Characters==
*Mr. Griffin – A former assistant professor of the University of Albuquerque, he obtained his master&#x27;s degree in English from Stanford University. He became a high-school English teacher because he felt high schools were lacking good teachers. He is married to Kathy Griffin, who is expecting their first child.
*Susan &quot;Sue&quot; McConnell – A junior, she was a straight-A student before taking Mr. Griffin&#x27;s class, where she is earning Bs. She has an obsession with David.
*Mark Kinney – A mentally unstable teen, he exhibits many of the signs of psychopathy. He was adopted by his aunt and uncle after his father was killed in a fire. 
*Jeff Garrett – A basketball player at Del Norte High School, he is dating Betsy.
*Betsy Cline – The head cheerleader, she is Jeff&#x27;s girlfriend, and the only child of the county commissioner, Harold Cline and his wife Liz. She is in love with Mark, yet he is uninterested in her.
*David &quot;Davy&quot; Ruggles – The senior class president, he lives with his mother and grandmother. Many readers have asked Duncan whether he is Mr. Griffin&#x27;s son, which is not stated in the book, and Duncan confirmed this is not true.

==Background==
The story developed from the character of Mark, who is based on the first boyfriend of Duncan&#x27;s oldest daughter. Duncan says he &quot;was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet&quot;, but that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t until things got very bad that we discovered he was the kind of guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog.&quot; She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenaged psychopath were placed in a high-school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. &#x27;Then I thought &quot;What could he make them do?&quot; The book moved from there.&#x27; Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan&#x27;s daughters had in high school, who &quot;was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing&quot;, but for whom Duncan&#x27;s daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.

&quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; was first published in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot;, along with &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Behind You&quot;, were the first group of 10 different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from &quot;AudioFile&quot; felt that Sala&#x27;s narration was effective, although occasionally, he &quot;seems to lose concentration and expression.&quot; A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio, and features the modernized text.

==Major themes==
In the letter Mr. Griffin wrote for Susan, he comments, &quot;It is indeed the little deaths, the small daily rejections of our well-meant offerings that render the soul lifeless.&quot; Duncan refers to this as one of the main themes in the novel, adding that the students &quot;were killing [Mr. Griffin]&#x27;s soul before they killed him physically.&quot; &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; also explores the downsides of peer pressure. Due to Susan&#x27;s desire for peer acceptance, she becomes involved in the plan to kidnap Mr. Griffin. The group has to deal with a result they did not anticipate for the kidnapping – Mr. Griffin&#x27;s death. They have to cover up the crime, while preventing Susan from revealing to the police what they have done.

==Reception==
&quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; has received several honors and awards. In 1978, it was selected as an American Library Association (ALA) Best Book for Young Adults. It was nominated for the 1981 California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category and in 1982, it won the Massachusetts Children&#x27;s Book Award. It was also given the 1982–1983 Alabama Camellia Children&#x27;s Choice Book Award in the grade 7–9 category. However, some people have objected to including &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; in schools and libraries; the novel was 64th in ALA&#x27;s list of most frequently challenged books from 1990–1999, and 25th in its list of most challenged/banned books from 2000–2009. According to the ALA, &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; was the fourth most challenged book of 2000 for &quot;violence and sexual content&quot;.

Drew Stevenson, writing for &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, stated, &quot;skillful plotting builds layers of tension that draws readers into the eye of the conflict&quot; and the ending &quot;is nicely handled in a manner which provides relief without removing any of the chilling implications.&quot; Zena Sutherland from &quot;Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x27;s Books&quot; commented that the &quot;end is logical, the construction of the plot and the relationships among the well-drawn characters is solid, and the story has pace and suspense.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Richard Peck felt that the book&#x27;s value &quot;lies in the twisted logic of the teenagers and how easily they can justify anything&quot;, but that &quot;the plot descends into unadulterated melodrama.&quot; He stated, &quot;&quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; &#x27;becomes &quot;an easy read when it shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;,&quot; although &quot;there&#x27;s unto the end: the parents are the last to lose their innocence.&quot;

==Adaptation==

The book was adapted into a television film of the same title, which first aired April 7, 1997, on NBC. It received a Nielsen rating of 10.7 and was viewed in 10.4 million households. The film starred Scott Bairstow as Mark Kinney, Amy Jo Johnson as Susan McConnell, Mario Lopez as David Ruggles, and Jay Thomas as Mr. Griffin, and was directed by Jack Bender. Maitland McDonagh from &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, stating, &quot;this tale wraps serious issues — peer pressure and the desire for social acceptance — in an entertaining crime-thriller tale that never seems entirely outlandish.&quot; She thought the story&#x27;s rhythm was &quot;disrupted by commercial-television pacing&quot;, but felt the cast, especially Johnson, delivered a strong performance. &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; was first released on VHS and DVD on March 7, 2000.

<text>Robert Joseph Birgeneau (born March 25, 1942) is a Canadian-American physicist and university administrator. He was the ninth chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley from 2004–13, and the fourteenth president of the University of Toronto from 2000-04.

==Biography==
The first from his family to finish high school, Birgeneau graduated from St. Michael&#x27;s College School in Toronto. He received a B.Sc in mathematics in 1963 from St. Michael&#x27;s College in the University of Toronto, where he also met his wife Mary Catherine; they have four children. Birgeneau received his Ph.D in physics from Yale University in 1966 for thesis titled &quot;Magnetic Interactions in Rare-Earth Insulators&quot; under the supervision of Werner P. Wolf.

He spent a year each on the faculties of Yale and the University of Oxford. From 1968 to 1975, he worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.

===MIT===
He then joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of physics. During his 25 years at MIT, he served as Chair of the Physics Department and ultimately as Dean of Science.

===University of Toronto===
He was then appointed to serve as the President of the University of Toronto, a role he held from 2000 to 2004. Birgeneau appointed Shirley Neuman as Vice President and Provost (chief academic officer) in July 2002, but she resigned on February 2, 2004, after just 19 months on the post. It was reported that Neuman’s head-strong approach alienated her from colleagues and students, and there were also tensions between Birgeneau and herself.

He left the University of Toronto after only four years of his term (despite the fact that his five-year term had been extended to seven years on his own request), causing a flurry of controversy with his abrupt departure.

===UC Berkeley===
He was recommended to the UC Board of Regents by Robert Dynes, then President of the UC system and a former colleague of Birgeneau when both worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.

Birgeneau has used his platform as Chancellor to make contributions to several political debates. On June 14, 2007, Birgeneau joined the President of Columbia University in condemning Britain&#x27;s University and College Union for boycotting Israeli academics and academic institutions and insisting that any boycott include their universities. Citing the &quot;likely&quot; threat to California&#x27;s academic competitiveness if Proposition 8 were passed, Birgeneau urged the UC Berkeley community to vote against a 2008 state ballot measure which would eliminate the right of gays and lesbians to marry. During the 2011-2012 academic year, he sent campus wide messages in support of the California Dream Act, which allows undocumented students to qualify for financial aid, the reform of Proposition 13, which would close corporate property tax loopholes passed by voters in the late 1970s and reallocate that funding to social services, including higher education, and the repeal of Proposition 209, which would reenact affirmative action and significantly increase diversity in the nation&#x27;s public higher education institutions.

Also during the 2011-2012 academic year, Birgeneau unveiled Berkeley MCAP, the Middle Class Access Plan, a new financial aid model that caps the total annual cost of an eligible students&#x27; education - from tuition and fees to expenses including room, board and books - at 15 percent of the family&#x27;s total income. Families with incomes from $80,000 to $140,000 and assets typical of that range are eligible for the program, which will provide grants beginning with the fall 2012 semester. While the UC-wide Blue and Gold program aids lower-income families, this is the first program of its kind in the system to benefit the middle class. It also served as impetus for the statewide Middle Class Scholarship program, announced by California Assembly Speaker John Perez.

Birgeneau was succeeded by Nicholas Dirks as chancellor of UC Berkeley on June 1, 2013.

<text>Sir Alexander Bannerman (7 October 1788 – 30 December 1864) was a Scottish merchant, vintner, politician and British colonial governor.

==Early life==
Known as &quot;Sandy&quot;, he was born on 7 October 1788 in Scotland. He was the eldest son of merchant Thomas Bannerman (1743–1820) and his wife, Jean (née Simson) Bannerman (1745–1817), who married in 1779. His younger brother, Thomas, was the father of Sir George Bannerman, 10th Baronet and grandfather of Sir Alexander Bannerman, 11th Baronet.

His maternal grandfather was George Simson of Hazlehead. His paternal grandparents were Aberdeen merchant Alexander Bannerman and Margaret (née Burnett) Bannerman. His uncle was Sir Alexander Bannerman, 6th Baronet.

Bannerman was a prominent businessman in his hometown of Aberdeen from where he managed the family wine business. He also had a hand in trading and whaling. Bannerman served as the city&#x27;s provost and in 1837, was elected dean of Marischal College, Aberdeen.

==Career==
Alexander Bannerman joined the town council of Aberdeen in 1811. He was a reformer, challenging the long-standing oligarchy led by James and Gavin Hadden, and was instrumental in establishing an elected trust to manage the new Aberdeen Harbour.

In 1832 he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen in the House of Commons, sitting as a Radical, and remained an MP until his retirement in 1847. Together with his wife, Margaret Gordon the granddaughter of former Governor Walter Patterson, Bannerman returned to the colony of her birth, when he took up the appointment in 1851 as governor of Prince Edward Island. On this occasion he was made a Knight Bachelor. Bannerman instituted responsible government on the island but was removed in 1854 due to political unrest in which he favoured the Reformers. Subsequently, he was governor of the Bahamas until 1857, when he returned north to become governor of Newfoundland, the second governor since responsible government had been granted.

He clashed with John Kent, the premier of Newfoundland, who he felt was corrupt. Bannerman accused Kent&#x27;s government, as did Bishop Mullock, of using relief aid as patronage and also accused Kent of being unreasonable in negotiations with France over the French Shore. In 1861, after Kent had accused Bannerman of conspiring with the courts and opposition Conservative Party of Newfoundland against a proposal to reduce the salaries of judges, Bannerman dismissed the Kent government and appointed the leader of the opposition, Hugh Hoyles as the new Premier.

Kent&#x27;s Liberal Party of Newfoundland defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence resulting in an election campaign that was fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. The Protestant Conservative Party of Newfoundland narrowly defeated Kent&#x27;s Liberals. Extensive rioting led to disputed results, with the Conservatives having a majority of only two until in a peaceful by-election Harbour Grace returned two Conservatives.
Bannerman&#x27; initial action in dismissing Kent had been rash and the Colonial Office told him so, but Hoyles, the new Premier, moved towards non-sectarian government, both bishops called for order, and the politics of class replaced the politics of religion. Bannerman resigned as governor in 1864 and returned to England.

==Personal life==

In 1825, Bannerman married Margaret Gordon, a daughter of Guthrie Gordon, Esq. Lady Bannerman, as she was known, was born in Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island, and was a granddaughter of Walter Patterson who had been the Island&#x27;s first governor. She was later identified as &quot;Carlyle&#x27;s first love&quot; by her biographer, who tells of the young schoolmaster Thomas Carlyle, in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, &quot;who was attracted by her intelligence and wit.&quot; Her family considered Carlyle as an unsuitable marriage prospect, and she eventually married Bannerman, a distant cousin.

While in England, he caught a cold and, in his enfeebled state, fell down a flight of stairs causing his death on 30 December 1864 in Mayfair, London aged 76.

He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

===Legacy===
Bannerman Park in St. John&#x27;s commemorates his name in Newfoundland.

<doc id="554835" wikidata="Q7984571" url="?curid=554835" title="West Brit">
<text>West Brit, an abbreviation of West Briton, is a derogatory term for an Irish person who is perceived as Anglophilic in matters of culture or politics. West Britain is a description of Ireland emphasising it as subject to British influence.

==History==
&quot;West Britain&quot; was used with reference to the Acts of Union 1800 which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Similarly &quot;North Britain&quot; for Scotland used after the 1603 Union of the Crowns and the Acts of Union 1707 connected it to the Kingdom of England (&quot;South Britain&quot;). In 1800 Thomas Grady, a Limerick unionist, published a collection of light verse named &quot;The West Briton&quot;, while an anti-union cartoon depicted an official offering bribes and proclaiming &quot;God save the King &amp; his Majesty&#x27;s subjects of west Britain that is to be!&quot; In 1801 the Latin description of George III on the Great Seal of the Realm was changed from &quot;Of Great Britain, France and Ireland King&quot; to &quot;Of the Britains King&quot;, ending the claim to the French throne and describing Great Britain and Ireland as &quot;the Britains&quot;.

Irish unionist MP Thomas Spring Rice (later Lord Monteagle of Brandon) said on 23 April 1834 in the House of Commons in opposing Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s motion for Repeal of the Union, &quot;I should prefer the name of West Britain to that of Ireland&quot;. Rice was derided by Henry Grattan later in the same debate: &quot;He tells us, that he belongs to England, and designates himself as a West Briton.&quot; Daniel O&#x27;Connell himself used the phrase at a pro-Repeal speech in Dublin in February 1836:
Here, O&#x27;Connell was hoping that Ireland would soon become as prosperous as &quot;North Britain&quot; had become after 1707, but supposed that if the Union did not deliver this, then some type of Irish home rule was essential. The Dublin administration as performed during the 1830s was intermediate between these two possibilities.

The term &quot;West Briton&quot; became used next pejoratively during the land struggle of the 1880s. D. P. Moran, who founded the publication &quot;The Leader&quot; in 1900, used the term frequently to describe those who he did not consider sufficiently Irish. It was synonymous with those he described as &quot;Sourfaces&quot;, who had mourned the death of the Queen Victoria in 1901. It included virtually all Church of Ireland Protestants and those Catholics who did not measure up to his definition of &quot;Irish Irelanders&quot;.

In 1907, Canon R. S. Ross-Lewin published a collection of loyal Irish poems using the pseudonym &quot;A County of Clare West Briton&quot;, explaining the epithet in the foreword:

Ernest Augustus Boyd&#x27;s 1924 collection &quot;Portraits: real and imaginary&quot; included &quot;A West Briton&quot;, which gave a table of West-Briton responses to certain words:
According to Boyd, &quot;The West Briton is the near Englishman ... an unfriendly caricature, the &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; of the least attractive English characteristics. ... The best that can be said ... is that the species is slowly becoming extinct. ... nationalism has become respectable&quot;. The opposite of the &quot;West Briton&quot; Boyd called the &quot;synthetic Gael&quot;.

After the independence of the Irish Free State, &quot;West British&quot; was applied mainly to anglophile Roman Catholics, the small number of Catholic unionists, as Protestants were expected to be naturally unionists. This was not automatic, since there were, and are, also Anglo-Irish Protestants favouring Irish republicanism (see Protestant Irish nationalism).

==Contemporary usage==
&quot;Brit&quot; meaning &quot;British person&quot;, attested in 1884, is pejorative in Irish usage, though used as a value-neutral colloquialism in Great Britain. During the Troubles, among nationalists &quot;the Brits&quot; specifically meant the British Army in Northern Ireland. &quot;West Brit&quot; is used presently by Irish people, chiefly within Ireland, to criticise a variety of perceived faults of other Irish people:
* &quot;Revisionism&quot; (compare historical revisionism and historical negationism): 
** Criticism of historical Irish uprisings. (State policy is to praise the patriotism of rebels up to the revolutionary period, while condemning later physical force republicans as antidemocratic.) 
** highlighting perceived benefits of British rule in Ireland
** downplaying British actions during historical events in Ireland such as the Great Famine
** Antipathy to Irish rebel songs.
* Anglophilia: following British popular culture; admiration for the British royal family; favouring the Republic of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations or becoming a Commonwealth Realm; emphasizing positive British influence in the world, past or present.
* Cultural cringe: appearing embarrassed by or disdainful of aspects of Irish culture, such as the Irish language, Hiberno-English, Gaelic games, or Irish traditional music.
* Partitionism: Opposition or indifference to a United Ireland; showing political endorsement for neo-unionism.
Not all people so labelled may actually be characterised by these stereotypical opinions and habits.

Public perception and self-identity can vary. During his 2011 presidential campaign, Sinn Féin candidate Martin McGuinness criticised what he termed West Brit elements of the media, who he said were out to undermine his attempt to win the election. He later said it was an &quot;off-the-cuff remark&quot; but did not define for the electorate what (or who) he had meant by the term.

Irish TV and radio presenter Terry Wogan, who spent most of his career working for the BBC in Britain, described himself as a West Brit: &quot;I&#x27;m an effete, urban Irishman. I was an avid radio listener as a boy, but it was the BBC, not RTÉ. I was a West Brit from the start. [...] I&#x27;m a kind of child of the Pale. I think I was born to succeed here [in the UK]; I have much more freedom than I had in Ireland&quot;. He became a dual citizen of Ireland and the UK and was eventually knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

The &quot;Irish Times&quot; columnist Donald Clarke noted a number of things that may prompt the application of a West Brit label, including being from Dublin (or south Dublin), supporting UK-based football teams, using the phrase &quot;Boxing Day&quot;, or voting for Fine Gael.

==Similar terms==
&quot;Castle Catholic&quot;, a derogatory term first used in the mid-19th century including in the writings of John Mitchel, is defined in some sources as equivalent to &quot;collaborator&quot;. It has been applied, by some Republicans, to middle-class Catholics assimilated into the pro-British establishment, and refers to Dublin Castle, the main office of the British administration. Sometimes an exaggerated pronunciation spelling was used, &quot;Castle Cawtholic&quot;, to suggest an accent imitative of British Received Pronunciation. Speaking in 2020, the historian Donal Fallon suggested that the term has a &quot;conspiratorial aspect&quot; and that there is a &quot;sharp edge to Castle Catholic that isn&#x27;t really there in West Brit&quot;.

The old-fashioned word &quot;shoneen&quot; (from Irish: &quot;Seoinín&quot;, diminutive of &quot;Seán&quot;, thus literally &#x27;Little John&#x27;, and apparently a reference to John Bull) was applied to those who emulated the homes, habits, lifestyle, pastimes, clothes, and opinions of the Protestant Ascendancy. P. W. Joyce&#x27;s &quot;English As We Speak It in Ireland&quot; defines it as &quot;a gentleman in a small way: a would-be gentleman who puts on superior airs.&quot; The Irish historian and academic, F. S. L. Lyons, defined a &quot;shoneen&quot; as a person &quot;of native Irish stock who committed the unforgivable sin of aping English or West-Briton manners and attitudes&quot;.

Similar to &quot;shoneen&quot;, another variant since c. 1840, &quot;jackeen&quot; (&#x27;Little Jack&#x27;), was used in the countryside in reference to Dubliners with British sympathies; it is a pun, substituting the nickname &quot;Jack&quot; for &quot;John&quot;, as a reference to the Union Jack, the British flag. During the 20th century, &quot;jackeen&quot; took on the more generalized meaning of &quot;a self-assertive worthless fellow&quot;.

==Antonyms==
The term is sometimes contrasted with Little Irelander, a derogatory term for an Irish person who is seen as an extreme nationalist, Anglophobic and xenophobic, while sometimes also practising Traditionalist Catholicism. The term was popularised by Seán Ó Faoláin. On the RTÉ program &quot;The Live Mike&quot; between 1978 and 1982, sketch comedian Dermot Morgan satirised &quot;Little Irelanders&quot;, by playing a bigoted Gaelic Athletic Association member who waved his hurley around while verbally attacking his pet hates.

&quot;Little Englander&quot; had been an equivalent term in British politics since about 1859.

An antonym of &quot;jackeen&quot;, in its modern sense of an urban (and strongly British-influenced) Dubliner, is culchie, referring to an unsophisticated Irish person who resides in the countryside.

<text>Texas Air Corporation, also known as Texas Air, was an airline holding company in the United States, incorporated in June 1980 by airline investor Frank Lorenzo to hold and invest in airlines. The company had its headquarters in the America Tower in the American General Center in Houston, Texas.

==History==
The company initially acted as a holding company for Texas International Airlines, which Lorenzo owned through his investment firm Jet Capital. It was the first airline to form a holding company; almost all airlines followed. Shortly after its formation, Texas Air founded New York Air, a low-cost carrier in the US Northeast. In 1981, Texas Air acquired Continental Airlines through a hostile takeover bid, the first time an airline sought to acquire another through a stock tender offer. Subsequently, Texas Air merged Continental with Texas International, retaining the Continental brand. In 1986, Texas Air acquired both Eastern Air Lines and People Express Airlines, including the assets of People Express&#x27;s bankrupt subsidiary, Frontier Airlines. In 1987, Texas Air consolidated its airline holdings by merging Frontier, New York Air and People Express into Continental, in turn making the latter the third-largest airline in the US, and leaving Texas Air with two mainline carriers: Continental and Eastern, as well a number of commuter airlines.

Texas Air was famous for its tough stance against organised labor groups, and usage of union-busting tactics to lower labor costs within its subsidiaries. In September 1983, Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stating that its high labor costs prevented it from effectively competing with non-union startup carriers and the new two-tier wage scales by its major competitor American Airlines. The bankruptcy filing allowed Continental to fire 8,000 employees, and subsequently rehire a small portion of them at lower wage rates and improved work rules. With lower labor costs, Texas Air successfully restructured Continental as a low-fare carrier, and allowed it to exit bankruptcy in 1986. In the same year, the company began a four-year battle with the International Association of Machinists in an attempt to lower labor costs at Eastern. In March 1989, Texas Air locked out Eastern&#x27;s mechanics, which resulted in the majority of Eastern employees walking out on strike, forcing the airline into bankruptcy. In April 1990, Eastern&#x27;s bankruptcy judge ordered the removal of Texas Air&#x27;s control of the carrier.

At its peak in 1986, Texas Air was the second-largest airline in the world, behind the USSR&#x27;s state carrier Aeroflot, and the largest airline in the United States, with control of 20% of the US domestic air travel market, a fleet of 600 aircraft, and an $8.5 billion valuation. However, by 1989, the company had $5.4 billion worth of debt, and lost a total of $2 billion in just two years, breaking the record in both 1988 and 1989 for the largest losses ever reported by a US airline. Following the loss of Eastern, in June 1990 Texas Air rebranded itself as &quot;Continental Airlines Holdings&quot;, in order to &quot;reflect the fact that the principal business of the company is Continental&quot;, according to Lorenzo. In August of the same year, Lorenzo agreed to leave the company after selling his remaining shares to SAS. However, the company was never able to recover from its significant debts and poor reputation, and entered bankruptcy in December. In November 1992, Continental and Britt Airways (a commuter airline owned by Texas Air) were bought by an Air Canada-led consortium, resulting in Continental Airlines Holdings being dissolved.

== Holdings ==

Alongside its official holdings, the company also operated through a number of shell companies in order to protect Texas Air&#x27;s core assets from bankruptcy proceedings, such as Texas Air Fuel Services, which controlled all fuel transactions for the company&#x27;s airline subsidiaries.

<text>Texas International Airlines Inc. was a United States local service carrier, known from 1940 until 1947 as Aviation Enterprises, until 1969 as Trans-Texas Airways (TTA), and as Texas International Airlines until 1982, when it merged with Continental Airlines. It was headquartered near William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas.

Trans-Texas Airways originally operated in Texas and surrounding states. In August 1953, it scheduled flights to 36 airports from El Paso to Memphis; in May 1968, TTa flew to 48 U.S. airports plus Monterrey, Tampico and Veracruz in Mexico. The airline changed its name to Texas International and continued to grow.

When Texas International was merged into Continental Airlines in 1982, it had grown to reach Baltimore, Colorado Springs, Denver, Fort Lauderdale, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Ontario CA., Mexico City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Omaha, Phoenix, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Tucson, and Washington, DC, and had an all-DC-9 jet fleet. In 2010, Continental merged into United Airlines.

==History==
In 1949, all Trans-Texas Airways flights were operated within the state of Texas with Douglas DC-3s which the airline called &quot;Starliners&quot;. In November 1949, it served Alpine, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Beeville, Brownsville, Brownwood, Carrizo Springs/Crystal City, Coleman, Dallas (Love Field), Del Rio, Eagle Pass, El Paso, Fort Stockton, Fort Worth, Galveston, Harlingen, Houston (Hobby Airport), Laredo, Lufkin, Marfa, McAllen, Palestine, San Angelo, San Antonio, Uvalde, Van Horn, and Victoria.

The network expanded to Memphis and Marshall in 1953, Lafayette in 1956, New Orleans and Jackson in 1959, into Mexico in 1967, and to Denver in 1969. In late 1963 the carrier added 13 new cities by taking over service formerly operated by Continental Airlines. These cities included Albuquerque, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs, Roswell, and Santa Fe in New Mexico as well as Abilene, Amarillo, Big Spring, College Station, Lubbock, Temple, and Waco in Texas.

About April 1961, Convair 240s formerly operated by American Airlines began carrying Trans-Texas passengers; the airline later converted them to Convair 600s, replacing the piston engines with Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines. These turboprop powered Convair aircraft were referred to by the airline as the &quot;Jet Powered TTa Silver Cloud 600&quot;. First scheduled CV-600 flights were in March 1966. Small Beechcraft C99 commuter turboprops were later added to serve the smaller cities of Longview, Lufkin, Galveston, Tyler and Victoria (the last DC-3 flight was in 1968).
In October 1966, Trans-Texas Airways introduced the Douglas DC-9-10 (which the airline marketed as the &quot;Pamper-jet&quot;) with its jet fleet subsequently being expanded to nineteen DC-9-10s and seven McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s. By 1968, TTa was flying DC-9s to Beaumont/Port Arthur; Harlingen; Hot Springs, Arkansas, Lake Charles, Louisiana; Roswell, New Mexico, and Santa Fe, New Mexico in addition to larger cities in its route system. DC-9&#x27;s briefly flew to Clovis, New Mexico, Carlsbad, New Mexico, and Hobbs, New Mexico in 1977. Also, in 1977, Texas International became the first airline to ban cigar and pipe smoking onboard.
Trans-Texas was derisively called &quot;Tree Top Airlines,&quot; &quot;Tinker Toy Airlines&quot;, and &quot;Teeter-Totter Airlines&quot; by competitors and cynical customers. When it changed its name to Texas International Airlines in April 1969, the company ran newspaper ads showing a Tinker Toy airplane flying along treetops. The copy read &quot;No More Tinker Toys. No More Treetops. We are now Texas International Airlines.&quot; As Texas International, the airline standardized on the DC-9 and Convair 600. The last Convair 600 flights were in 1979 and Texas International became all-jet with DC-9-10s and DC-9-30s.

In 1970, Texas International served: Abilene, Amarillo, Austin, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Big Spring, Brownwood, Bryan/College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas/Ft. Worth, El Paso, Galveston, Harlingen, Houston, Laredo, Longview, Lubbock, Lufkin, McAllen, Midland/Odessa, San Angelo, San Antonio, Temple, Tyler, Victoria, Waco, and Wichita Falls, Texas.

Outside of Texas in 1970, Texas International flew to Arkansas (El Dorado, Hot Springs, Jonesboro, Little Rock, Pine Bluff and Texarkana); California (Los Angeles); Colorado, (Denver); Louisiana (Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Fort Polk, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Monroe, New Orleans and Shreveport); Mississippi (Jackson); New Mexico (Albuquerque, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs, Roswell and Santa Fe); Tennessee (Memphis); and Utah (Salt Lake City). In Mexico flights reached Monterrey, Tampico, Mérida and Veracruz. The airline had several &quot;milk run&quot; flights, such as flight 904, a DC-9-10 that left Los Angeles at 11:00 a.m. and stopped in Albuquerque, Roswell, Midland/Odessa, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston, and Beaumont/Port Arthur, before arriving in Lafayette at 8:34 p.m.

After suffering annual losses of up to $3 million, Texas International was acquired in 1972 by Jet Capital Corporation headed by 32-year-old Frank Lorenzo. The airline quickly realized a $6 million profit, largely due to wage cuts spearheaded by Lorenzo and sharp marketing efforts.

In the mid-1970s, in response to competition from Southwest Airlines, Texas International successfully petitioned the Civil Aeronautics Board to allow discounted fares. These fares become a staple of the airline and were advertised as &quot;Peanuts Fares&quot;. In spring 1978, the airline was flying nonstop between Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and both Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and Houston Hobby Airport (HOU), up to 18 round trip DC-9 flights a day, all with &quot;Peanut Fares&quot;. The Texas International March 15, 1978 timetable advertised &quot;Peanut Fares&quot; in other markets as well.

The first modern frequent-flyer program was created at Texas International Airlines in 1979 called &quot;Payola Passes.&quot; Lacking the computer resources of their larger competitors, Texas International was overtaken by American&#x27;s introduction of AAdvantage in May 1981.

On June 11, 1980, Lorenzo established a holding company, Texas Air Corporation, for Texas International and New York Air, the first holding company in the airline industry. Texas Air then acquired Continental Airlines in 1982 and merged Continental and Texas International on October 31, 1982, under the former&#x27;s name. The last Texas International aircraft were seen in 1983.

Today&#x27;s successor to Trans-Texas Airways and Texas International is United Airlines, which merged with Continental in 2010. United currently operates a large hub at Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), a former hub for Texas International. The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) was also a hub for Texas International before its merger with Continental.

Over the years, Texas International Airlines operated the following aircraft:

===Livery===
Following the name change to Texas International, the airline&#x27;s early livery consisted of a dark purple cheatline above the windows leading up into three branches on the tail, which in 1973 was changed to a thick red cheatline across the windows on a white fuselage, along with a Columbia blue cheatline with a large white star on a blue tail.

<text>Four Rooms is a 1995 American anthology 
farce black comedy film co-written and co-directed by Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino. The story is set in the fictional Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Tim Roth plays Ted, the bellhop and main character in the frame story, whose first night on the job consists of four very different encounters with various hotel guests.

&quot;Four Rooms&quot; was released in the United States on December 25, 1995, by Miramax Films. The film received mixed reviews from critics who praised the segments directed by Rodriguez and Tarantino, but heavily criticized the segments by Anders and Rockwell. For her role, Madonna won for Worst Supporting Actress at the 16th Golden Raspberry Awards.

==Plot==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve, bellhop Sam (Marc Lawrence) of the Hotel Mon Signor briefs his replacement, Ted (Tim Roth).

The film&#x27;s animated opening credits, inspired by the cartoons of &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, feature the scat song &quot;Vertigogo&quot; by Combustible Edison.

===Honeymoon Suite – &quot;The Missing Ingredient&quot;===
*Written and directed by Allison Anders
Ted assists a group of unusual women with their luggage, which he brings to the Honeymoon Suite. He learns they are a coven of witches, attempting to reverse a spell cast on their goddess, Diana (Amanda De Cadenet). The ritual requires them each to place an ingredient into a large cauldron; however, one (Ione Skye) has still to retrieve her ingredient – semen – with one hour left. She seduces Ted and they have sex in the cauldron. He leaves and they complete the ritual, and Diana emerges from the cauldron.

After Ted&#x27;s service in the honeymoon suite, a party guest from another room (Lawrence Bender) calls the front desk for some ice. He is unsure which floor he is on, but eventually directs Ted to Room 404.

===Room 404 – &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;===
*Written and directed by Alexandre Rockwell
At Room 404, Ted finds himself in a fantasy hostage situation. Siegfried (David Proval) maniacally accuses Ted, whom he calls Theodore, of having slept with his wife Angela (Jennifer Beals). Ted is forced at gunpoint to participate in the scenario, uncertain of what is real. He tries to escape through the bathroom window but gets stuck, and a party guest vomits onto him from the window above. As Ted frees himself and climbs out, another guest (Paul Skemp) arrives at Room 404 and is greeted by Siegfried in the same manner.

===Room 309 – &quot;The Misbehavers&quot;===
*Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez 
A husband (Antonio Banderas) and wife (Tamlyn Tomita) leave for a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, tipping Ted $500 to keep an eye on their children, Sarah and Juancho (Lana McKissack and Danny Verduzco). Ted instructs the children to stay in their room; when he leaves, they vandalize the room, exploding a bottle of champagne. They call Ted for toothbrushes, and he tries unsuccessfully to put them to bed. He leaves but is summoned back to find the room in further chaos: a painting has been turned into a dartboard with lipstick and a syringe, Juancho has a cigarette, Sarah has a bottle of liquor, the television is set to an adult channel, and the children have found a dead prostitute (Patricia Vonne) in the box spring. Sarah stabs Ted in the leg with the syringe when he repeatedly uses the word &quot;whore&quot; and Juancho accidentally sets the room on fire. Their father returns, carrying his passed-out wife, and asks Ted, &quot;Did they misbehave?&quot; The sprinkler system activates while everyone stands still.

Unsettled, Ted calls his boss Betty (Kathy Griffin) to quit. After a conversation with Margaret (Marisa Tomei), he gets Betty on the phone and tries to quit, but receives a call from the hotel penthouse. Betty persuades him to stay on long enough to tend to the guests.

===Penthouse – &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot;===
*Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino

The penthouse is occupied by famous director Chester Rush (Tarantino) and his friends. They request a block of wood, three nails, a ball of twine, a bucket of ice, a doughnut, a club sandwich, and a hatchet. Once Ted brings in the items, substituting a meat cleaver for the hatchet, he is invited to join their challenge. Inspired by the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;Man from the South&quot; (incorrectly referred to as &quot;The Man from Rio&quot;), Chester&#x27;s friend Norman (Paul Calderón) has bet his little finger against Chester&#x27;s car that he can ignite his Zippo lighter ten times in a row. Ted tries to leave, but Chester entices him to stay by offering $100 to hear him out and a further $900 to act as referee and sever the finger should Norman fail. Ted agrees to participate; Norman&#x27;s lighter fails on the first try, and Ted immediately chops off his finger, sweeps up the money, and leaves the penthouse with an energetic step. As the credits roll, Chester and company frantically prepare to take a screaming Norman to the hospital.

The four segments are shown chronologically, except for &quot;The Misbehavers&quot;, the events of which both precede and succeed the events of &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;.

There are some connections between the four segments:
*In &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;, Ted recalls the witches&#x27; ritual in &quot;The Missing Ingredient&quot; with the expression &quot;weird voodoo thing&quot;.
*Ted can be seen with the two cherries from &quot;The Missing Ingredient&quot; at the beginning of &quot;The Misbehavers&quot;.
*Sarah in &quot;The Misbehavers&quot; calls a random room to ask a question. The man who picks up happens to be Siegfried from &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;.
*Angela appears in both &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; and &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot;.
*When calling his boss, just before the beginning of &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot;, Ted recalls the events of the first three segments.

==Production==
Miramax presold Japanese distribution rights to Shochiku along with Gary Fleder&#x27;s &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, George T. Miller&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, John Ehle&#x27;s &quot;The Journey of August King&quot; and Joe Chappelle&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in a bulk acquisition deal.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
James Berardinelli of ReelViews described it as &quot;one of 1995&#x27;s major disappointments&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said it &quot;asserts itself as a goof so laboriously and aggressively that you almost feel pinned back in your seat&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; singled out Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;The Misbehavers&quot; segment as the funniest of the film and the one that most effectively capitalized on Roth. Of Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot; segment, Ebert said, &quot;Tarantino had the right idea in choosing to satirize himself but unfortunately does not seem to understand why he is funny. A movie about him making this film could have been hilarious.&quot;

The film won a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for Madonna.

The film holds a 13% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 45 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Four Rooms&quot; comes stocked with a ton of talent on both sides of the camera, yet only manages to add up to a particularly uneven – and dismayingly uninspired – anthology effort.

===Box office===
The film grossed $4,257,354 in only 319 theaters.

<doc id="554861" wikidata="Q31566" url="?curid=554861" title="Coastal plain">
<text>A coastal plain (also coastal plains, coastal lowland, coastal lowlands) is an area of flat, low-lying land adjacent to a sea coast. A fall line commonly marks the border between a coastal plain and an upland area.

==Formation==
Coastal plains can form in one of two ways; some begin as a continental shelf, a flat piece of land located below sea level, and are created when the ocean level falls, exposing the land. Others develop when river currents carry sediment into the ocean, which is deposited and builds up over time until it forms a coastal plain. They are generally separated from the rest of the interior by proximate landforms, like mountains.

==Locations==
Some of the largest coastal plains are in Alaska and the southeastern United States. The Gulf Coastal Plain of North America extends northwards from the Gulf of Mexico along the Lower Mississippi River to the Ohio River, which is a distance of about . The Atlantic Coastal Plain runs from the New York Bight to Florida. 

The Coastal Plains of India lie on either side of the Deccan Plateau, along the western and eastern coasts of India. They extend for about 6,150 km from the Rann of Kutch in the west to West Bengal in the east. They are broadly divided into the Western Coastal Plains and the Eastern Coastal Plains. The two coastal plains meet at Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of the Indian mainland. The eastern coastal plain is located between The Bay of Bengal and the eastern Ghats and the western coastal plain is located between the Arabian Sea and the western Ghats.

In Australia, there exists the South East Coastal Plain in Victoria that includes the Gippsland Plain, the eastern portion of Melbourne, Otway Plain and Warrnambool Plain subregions. The Gippsland Plain features the depressed coastal and alluvial plains, barrier dunes and swampy flatlands. They mostly consist of grassland and grassy woodlands on yellow and grey textured fertile soils. Another is the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia, which includes the city of Perth. It is one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger West Australian Shield division.

<doc id="554862" wikidata="Q807915" url="?curid=554862" title="Barcelona Pavilion">
<text>The Barcelona Pavilion (; ; &quot;German Pavilion&quot;), designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich, was the German Pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona, Spain. This building was used for the official opening of the German section of the exhibition. It is an important building in the history of modern architecture, known for its simple form and its spectacular use of extravagant materials, such as marble, red onyx and travertine. Furnishings specifically designed for the building, including the Barcelona chair, are still in production. It has inspired many important modernist buildings. The original structure was demolished in 1930, and the existing reconstruction was completed in 1986.

==Concept==
Mies and Reich were offered the commission of this building in 1928 after his successful administration of the 1927 Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart. The German Republic entrusted Mies with the artistic management and erection of not only the Barcelona Pavilion, but for the buildings for all the German sections at the 1929 International Exhibition. However, Mies had severe time constraints—he had to design the Barcelona Pavilion in less than a year—and was also dealing with uncertain economic conditions.

In the years following World War I, Germany started to turn around. The economy started to recover after the 1924 Dawes Plan. The pavilion for the International Exhibition was supposed to represent the new Weimar Germany: democratic, culturally progressive, prospering, and thoroughly pacifist; a self-portrait through architecture. The Commissioner, Georg von Schnitzler said it should give &quot;voice to the spirit of a new era&quot;. This concept was carried out with the realization of the &quot;free plan&quot; and the &quot;floating roof&quot;.

==Building==

Mies&#x27;s response to the proposal by von Schnitzler was radical. After rejecting the original site for aesthetic reasons, Mies agreed to a quiet site at the narrow side of a wide, diagonal axis, where the pavilion would still offer viewpoints and a route leading to one of the exhibition&#x27;s main attractions, the Poble Espanyol.

The pavilion was to be bare, with no exhibits, leaving only the structure accompanying a single sculpture and specially-designed furniture (the Barcelona Chair). This lack of accommodation enabled Mies to treat the Pavilion as a continuous space; blurring inside and outside. &quot;The design was predicated on an absolute distinction between structure and enclosure—a regular grid of cruciform steel columns interspersed by freely spaced planes&quot;. However, the structure was more of a hybrid style, some of these planes also acted as supports. The floor plan is very simple. The entire building rests on a plinth of travertine. A southern U-shaped enclosure, also of travertine, helps form a service annex and a large water basin. The floor slabs of the pavilion project out and over the pool—once again connecting inside and out. Another U-shaped wall on the opposite side of the site also forms a smaller water basin. This is where the statue by Georg Kolbe sits. The roof plates, relatively small, are supported by the chrome-clad, cruciform columns. This gives the impression of a hovering roof. Robin Evans said that the reflective columns appear to be struggling to hold the &quot;floating&quot; roof plane down, not to be bearing its weight.
Mies wanted this building to become &quot;an ideal zone of tranquillity&quot; for the weary visitor, who should be invited into the pavilion on the way to the next attraction. Since the pavilion lacked a real exhibition space, the building itself was to become the exhibit. The pavilion was designed to &quot;block&quot; any passage through the site, rather, one would have to go through the building. Visitors would enter by going up a few stairs, and due to the slightly sloped site, would leave at ground level in the direction of the Poble Espanyol. The visitors were not meant to be led in a straight line through the building, but to take continuous turnabouts. The walls not only created space, but also directed visitor&#x27;s movements. This was achieved by wall surfaces being displaced against each other, running past each other, and creating a space that became narrower or wider.

Another unique feature of this building is the exotic materials Mies chooses to use. Plates of high-grade stone materials like veneers of Tinos &quot;verde antico&quot; marble and golden onyx as well as tinted glass of grey, green, white, as well as translucent glass, perform exclusively as spatial dividers.

Because this was planned as an exhibition pavilion, it was intended to exist only temporarily. The building was torn down in early 1930, not even a year after it was completed.

==Reconstruction==
Between 1983 and 1986, a group of Catalan architects formed the Mies van der Rohe Foundation and reconstructed the pavilion permanently, based on historical drawings and rediscovered footings on the site. The reconstruction has been a popular tourist destination, but it also has been controversial among architects, critics, and historians. Some have hailed it as a revived masterpiece, some have condemned it as a &quot;fake,&quot; and others are ambivalent. &quot;[T]his building is not supposed to exist,&quot; asserted Paul Goldberger at the time. During planning, Philip Johnson wondered, &quot;The problem before us is should a dream be realized or not? We have made such a myth of that building. Shouldn’t it be left in the sacred vault of the memory bank?&quot; Architect Lance Hosey has thoroughly documented reactions to the reconstruction, concluding that while the reconstruction is a better physical artifact, the original was an irreplaceable product of its sociopolitical context.

==Sculpture==
The Pavilion was not only a pioneer for construction forms with a fresh, disciplined understanding of space, but also for modelling new opportunities for an association of free art and architecture. Mies placed Georg Kolbe&#x27;s &quot;Alba&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;) in the small water basin, leaving the larger one all the more empty. The sculpture also ties into the highly reflective materials Mies used—he chose the place where these optical effects would have the strongest impact; the building offers multiple views of &quot;Alba&quot;. &quot;From now on, in the sense of equality for juxtaposing building and visual work, sculptures were no longer to be applied retrospectively to the building, but rather to be a part of the spatial design, to help define and interpret it. To the day, one of the most notable examples is the Barcelona Pavilion&quot;.

==Interventions programme==
Since the Pavilion&#x27;s reconstruction in the 1980s, the Mies van der Rohe Foundation has invited leading artists and architects to temporarily alter the Pavilion. These installations and alterations, called &quot;interventions&quot;, have kept the pavilion as a node of debate on architectural ideas and practices. The list of invited people includes architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA) who added spiral acrylic interior walls, artist Ai Weiwei who refilled two pools with coffee and milk, Andrés Jaque who revealed the pavilion&#x27;s so far disregarded basement and its role in hiding the daily making of the site&#x27;s experience, Enric Miralles, Antoni Muntadas who brought to the pavilion the smell of the MoMA archives where its memory is preserved and Jordi Bernadó who removed the pavilion&#x27;s glass doors. The architect and activist Andrés Jaque (Office for Political Innovation), artists Katarzyna Krakowiak, Laura Martínez de Guereñu, and the designer Sabine Marcelis have also been commissioned to create pieces for the interventions programme.
==Lilly Reich Grant for equality in architecture==
In 2018, the Mies van der Rohe Foundation presented the first edition of the Lilly Reich Grant for equality in architecture. The recipient of the inaugural grant was &quot;Re-enactment: Lilly Reich&#x27;s work occupies the Barcelona Pavilion&quot; submitted by Laura Martínez de Guereñu. In 2020, the second grant was awarded to &quot;[On Set with] Lilly Reich&quot; submitted by Laura Lizondo Sevilla, Débora Domingo Calabuig, and Avelina Prat García. The third grant, in 2022, was awarded to the submission &quot;Anna Bofill Levi. Architecture as a Counter-Melody (1977–1996)&quot; by María-Elia Gutiérrez Mozo, José Parra Martínez, Ana Gilsanz Díaz, and Joaquín Arnau Amo.

<doc id="554867" wikidata="Q1985141" url="?curid=554867" title="Non-blocking algorithm">
<text>In computer science, an algorithm is called non-blocking if failure or suspension of any thread cannot cause failure or suspension of another thread; for some operations, these algorithms provide a useful alternative to traditional blocking implementations. A non-blocking algorithm is lock-free if there is guaranteed system-wide progress, and wait-free if there is also guaranteed per-thread progress. &quot;Non-blocking&quot; was used as a synonym for &quot;lock-free&quot; in the literature until the introduction of obstruction-freedom in 2003.

The word &quot;non-blocking&quot; was traditionally used to describe telecommunications networks that could route a connection through a set of relays &quot;without having to re-arrange existing calls&quot; (see Clos network). Also, if the telephone exchange &quot;is not defective, it can always make the connection&quot; (see nonblocking minimal spanning switch).

== Motivation ==
The traditional approach to multi-threaded programming is to use locks to synchronize access to shared resources. Synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, and critical sections are all mechanisms by which a programmer can ensure that certain sections of code do not execute concurrently, if doing so would corrupt shared memory structures. If one thread attempts to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, the thread will block until the lock is free.

Blocking a thread can be undesirable for many reasons. An obvious reason is that while the thread is blocked, it cannot accomplish anything: if the blocked thread had been performing a high-priority or real-time task, it would be highly undesirable to halt its progress.

Other problems are less obvious. For example, certain interactions between locks can lead to error conditions such as deadlock, livelock, and priority inversion. Using locks also involves a trade-off between coarse-grained locking, which can significantly reduce opportunities for parallelism, and fine-grained locking, which requires more careful design, increases locking overhead and is more prone to bugs.

Unlike blocking algorithms, non-blocking algorithms do not suffer from these downsides, and in addition are safe for use in interrupt handlers: even though the preempted thread cannot be resumed, progress is still possible without it. In contrast, global data structures protected by mutual exclusion cannot safely be accessed in an interrupt handler, as the preempted thread may be the one holding the lock. While this can be rectified by masking interrupt requests during the critical section, this requires the code in the critical section to have bounded (and preferably short) running time, or excessive interrupt latency may be observed.

A lock-free data structure can be used to improve performance.
A lock-free data structure increases the amount of time spent in parallel execution rather than serial execution, improving performance on a multi-core processor, because access to the shared data structure does not need to be serialized to stay coherent.

== Implementation ==
With few exceptions, non-blocking algorithms use atomic read-modify-write primitives that the hardware must provide, the most notable of which is compare and swap (CAS). Critical sections are almost always implemented using standard interfaces over these primitives (in the general case, critical sections will be blocking, even when implemented with these primitives). In the 1990s all non-blocking algorithms had to be written &quot;natively&quot; with the underlying primitives to achieve acceptable performance. However, the emerging field of software transactional memory promises standard abstractions for writing efficient non-blocking code.

Much research has also been done in providing basic data structures such as stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables. These allow programs to easily exchange data between threads asynchronously.

Additionally, some non-blocking data structures are weak enough to be implemented without special atomic primitives. These exceptions include:

* a single-reader single-writer ring buffer FIFO, with a size which evenly divides the overflow of one of the available unsigned integer types, can unconditionally be implemented safely using only a memory barrier
* Read-copy-update with a single writer and any number of readers. (The readers are wait-free; the writer is usually lock-free, until it needs to reclaim memory).
* Read-copy-update with multiple writers and any number of readers. (The readers are wait-free; multiple writers generally serialize with a lock and are not obstruction-free).

Several libraries internally use lock-free techniques, but it is difficult to write lock-free code that is correct.

Non-blocking algorithms generally involve a series of read, read-modify-write, and write instructions in a carefully designed order.
Optimizing compilers can aggressively re-arrange operations.
Even when they don&#x27;t, many modern CPUs often re-arrange such operations (they have a &quot;weak consistency model&quot;),
unless a memory barrier is used to tell the CPU not to reorder.
C++11 programmers can use codice_1 in codice_2,
and C11 programmers can use codice_3,
both of which supply types and functions that tell the compiler not to re-arrange such instructions, and to insert the appropriate memory barriers.

== Wait-freedom ==
Wait-freedom is the strongest non-blocking guarantee of progress, combining guaranteed system-wide throughput with starvation-freedom. An algorithm is wait-free if every operation has a bound on the number of steps the algorithm will take before the operation completes.
This property is critical for real-time systems and is always nice to have as long as the performance cost is not too high.

It was shown in the 1980s that all algorithms can be implemented wait-free, and many transformations from serial code, called &quot;universal constructions&quot;, have been demonstrated. However, the resulting performance does not in general match even naïve blocking designs. Several papers have since improved the performance of universal constructions, but still, their performance is far below blocking designs.

Several papers have investigated the difficulty of creating wait-free algorithms. For example, it has been shown that the widely available atomic &quot;conditional&quot; primitives, CAS and LL/SC, cannot provide starvation-free implementations of many common data structures without memory costs growing linearly in the number of threads.

However, these lower bounds do not present a real barrier in practice, as spending a cache line or exclusive reservation granule (up to 2 KB on ARM) of store per thread in the shared memory is not considered too costly for practical systems. Typically, the amount of store logically required is a word, but physically CAS operations on the same cache line will collide, and LL/SC operations in the same exclusive reservation granule will collide, so the amount of store physically required is greater.

Wait-free algorithms were rare until 2011, both in research and in practice. However, in 2011 Kogan and Petrank presented a wait-free queue building on the CAS primitive, generally available on common hardware. Their construction expanded the lock-free queue of Michael and Scott, which is an efficient queue often used in practice. A follow-up paper by Kogan and Petrank provided a method for making wait-free algorithms fast and used this method to make the wait-free queue practically as fast as its lock-free counterpart. A subsequent paper by Timnat and Petrank provided an automatic mechanism for generating wait-free data structures from lock-free ones. Thus, wait-free implementations are now available for many data-structures.

Under reasonable assumptions, Alistarh, Censor-Hillel, and Shavit showed that lock-free algorithms are practically wait-free. Thus, in the absence of hard deadlines, wait-free algorithms may not be worth the additional complexity that they introduce.

== Lock-freedom ==
Lock-freedom allows individual threads to starve but guarantees system-wide throughput. An algorithm is lock-free if, when the program threads are run for a sufficiently long time, at least one of the threads makes
progress (for some sensible definition of progress).
All wait-free algorithms are lock-free.

In particular, if one thread is suspended, then a lock-free algorithm guarantees that the remaining threads can still make progress. Hence, if two threads can contend for the same mutex lock or spinlock, then the algorithm is &quot;not&quot; lock-free. (If we suspend one thread that holds the lock, then the second thread will block.)

An algorithm is lock-free if infinitely often operation by some processors will succeed in a finite number of steps. For instance, if processors are trying to execute an operation, some of the processes will succeed in finishing the operation in a finite number of steps and others might fail and retry on failure. The difference between wait-free and lock-free is that wait-free operation by each process is guaranteed to succeed in a finite number of steps, regardless of the other processors.

In general, a lock-free algorithm can run in four phases: completing one&#x27;s own operation, assisting an obstructing operation, aborting an obstructing operation, and waiting. Completing one&#x27;s own operation is complicated by the possibility of concurrent assistance and abortion, but is invariably the fastest path to completion.

The decision about when to assist, abort or wait when an obstruction is met is the responsibility of a &quot;contention manager&quot;. This may be very simple (assist higher priority operations, abort lower priority ones), or may be more optimized to achieve better throughput, or lower the latency of prioritized operations.

Correct concurrent assistance is typically the most complex part of a lock-free algorithm, and often very costly to execute: not only does the assisting thread slow down, but thanks to the mechanics of shared memory, the thread being assisted will be slowed, too, if it is still running.

== Obstruction-freedom ==
Obstruction-freedom is the weakest natural non-blocking progress guarantee. An algorithm is obstruction-free if at any point, a single thread executed in isolation (i.e., with all obstructing threads suspended) for a bounded number of steps will complete its operation. All lock-free algorithms are obstruction-free.

Obstruction-freedom demands only that any partially completed operation can be aborted and the changes made rolled back. Dropping concurrent assistance can often result in much simpler algorithms that are easier to validate. Preventing the system from continually live-locking is the task of a contention manager.

Some obstruction-free algorithms use a pair of &quot;consistency markers&quot; in the data structure. Processes reading the data structure first read one consistency marker, then read the relevant data into an internal buffer, then read the other marker, and then compare the markers. The data is consistent if the two markers are identical. Markers may be non-identical when the read is interrupted by another process updating the data structure. In such a case, the process discards the data in the internal buffer and tries again.

<text>Naval Station Mayport is a major United States Navy base on San Pablo Island in Jacksonville, Florida. It contains a protected harbor that can accommodate aircraft carrier-size vessels, ship&#x27;s intermediate maintenance activity (SIMA) and a military airfield (Admiral David L. McDonald Field) with one asphalt paved runway (5/23) measuring .

==Base history==

The station was commissioned in December 1942. It was reclassified as a Naval Sea Frontier base in 1943. A new naval auxiliary air station (NAAS) was established in April 1944. The naval section Base and the NAAS supported the Atlantic Fleet during World War II. Both were closed after the war. In June 1948, Mayport was reestablished as a naval outlying landing field. The base area was increased to and the runway was extended in the mid 1950s.

 became the first capital ship to use the new aircraft carrier basin in October 1952. The Base was renamed back to a Naval Auxiliary Air Station in July 1955. The naval station was extended to accommodate more ships, sailors and their families and the airfield re-designated as a separate naval air station in 1988. As part of post-Cold War force reductions and staff consolidations, NAS Mayport was merged back into NS Mayport in 1992.

NS Mayport has grown to become the third-largest naval surface fleet concentration area in the United States. The station has a busy harbor capable of accommodating 34 ships and an runway capable of handling most aircraft in the Department of Defense inventory.

Naval Station Mayport is also home to the Navy&#x27;s U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command / United States Fourth Fleet, reactivated in 2008 after being deactivated in 1950.

The base has historically served as the homeport to various conventionally powered aircraft carriers of the United States Atlantic Fleet, including (1960–1971), (1956–1977), (1977–1993), (1957–1994), and, most recently, (1995–2007). With the decommissioning of all conventionally-powered aircraft carriers by the U.S. Navy, no carriers are presently assigned to Mayport. However, both houses of Congress have passed legislation authorizing about US$75 million for dredging and upgrades at NAVSTA Mayport to accommodate a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

On 29 January 2010, the &quot;Quadrennial Defense Review Report&quot; stated that a nuclear aircraft carrier would be homeported at NS Mayport. The action will help protect the fleet against a potential terror attack, accident or natural disaster, because all east coast aircraft carriers are currently based at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, according to the report. West coast aircraft carriers are split between Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California, Naval Base Kitsap and Naval Station Everett in Washington state and one carrier assigned to the Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) homeported at Naval Base Yokosuka, Japan.

In 2009, Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense, stated, &quot;Having a single (nuclear carrier) homeport has not been considered acceptable on the west coast and should not be considered acceptable on the east coast.&quot; The decision was opposed by elected officials in Virginia, who would lose 3,500 sailors and their dependents, $425 million in revenue each year, and most importantly, 6,000 support jobs. The Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce estimated the loss at 11,000 jobs and $650 million per year. Infrastructure changes and facility construction at Mayport were estimated to take five years and cost over half a billion dollars. The 2011 budget committed $590 million during the fiscal years from 2011 to 2019, so a carrier may not move to Mayport until 2019. An amphibious group was assigned sooner. The Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), consisting of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;, and relocated to Mayport between December 2013 and August 2014.

The Virginia congressional delegation fought the loss of even one of Naval Station Norfolk&#x27;s aircraft carriers boost to their economy by citing other areas such as shipbuilding to spend the Navy&#x27;s tight budget.

On 5 September 2018, the Royal Navy&#x27;s new aircraft carrier, and escort frigate , arrived at Mayport for resupplying, on her first deployment to the United States for &quot;Westlant 18&quot;.

===Littoral Combat Ship Squadron Two===
A 2013 report from the Navy revealed that they are considering basing as many as 14 littoral combat ships at NS Mayport. Littoral Combat Ship Squadron Two (LCSRON2) was established at the base on 7 November 2014. All &quot;Freedom&quot; variant LCSs, with the exception of the are assigned to LCSRON2. Currently , , , , Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Cooperstown, and Marinette are assigned to the squadron, with upcoming ships Nantucket, Beloit, and Cleveland expected to be added as they come into service.

===Commander Naval Surface Group Southeast===
Mayport had been the home of Destroyer Squadron 14 for years. On 31 July 2015, the squadron was merged with Cruiser-Destroyer Readiness Support Detachment Mayport to form Naval Surface Squadron Fourteen (NAVSURFRON14). In 2024, the SURFRON was renamed to Commander Naval Surface Group Southeast (CNSG-SE). This was to facilitate changes in the roles and responsibilities of the Commodore. Currently, the surface group (SURFGRU) consists of the destroyers &quot;Ramage&quot;, &quot;Carney&quot;, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, &quot;Donald Cook&quot;, Lassen&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot;, &quot;Farragut&quot;, &quot;Jason Dunham&quot;, &quot;Thomas Hudner&quot;, &quot;Delbert D. Black&quot;, and &quot;John Basilone&quot;.

===&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; Amphibious Ready Group===
The Amphibious Ready Group is no longer based in Mayport. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; shifted homeports to Naval Station Norfolk in December 2021, &quot;New York&quot; shifted in November 2021, and &quot;Fort McHenry&quot; was decommissioned in March 2021.

==Adm David L. McDonald Field==
On 1 April 1944, the air facility at Mayport was commissioned as Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) Mayport. Following World War II, the NAAS was decommissioned and placed in a caretaker status. The United States Coast Guard took over the base and operated a small &quot;Boot Camp&quot; there for several years, but they vacated Mayport in late 1947 due to budget cuts. Mayport was reactivated again in June 1948 as a Naval Outlying Landing Field under the cognizance of the Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station Jacksonville. As helicopter aviation evolved during the Cold War, Mayport became the East Coast home for the Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) MK III squadrons. As a reflection of growth, Naval Air Facility Mayport was re-designated as a naval air station in 1988.

<doc id="554871" wikidata="Q1146838" url="?curid=554871" title="Valentia Island">
<text>Valentia Island () is one of Ireland&#x27;s most westerly points. It lies off the Iveragh Peninsula in the southwest of County Kerry. It is linked to the mainland by the Maurice O&#x27;Neill Memorial Bridge at Portmagee. A car ferry also departs from Reenard Point to Knightstown, the island&#x27;s main settlement, from April to October. Another, smaller village named Chapeltown sits at roughly the midpoint of the island, from the bridge. Valentia Island&#x27;s permanent population is 658 (). It is about long by almost wide, making it the fifth-biggest island off the Irish coast.

==Name==
The English name &#x27;Valentia&#x27; or &#x27;Valencia&#x27; Island does not come from the Spanish city of Valencia. Instead it comes from the Irish name of Valentia Harbour, &quot;cuan Bhéil Inse&quot;, &quot;harbour-mouth of the island&quot;. It was anglicized as &#x27;Bealinche&#x27; and &#x27;Ballentia&#x27; before evolving into &#x27;Valentia&#x27;. It is possible the spelling was influenced by Spanish sailors; there is a grave marker to Spanish sailors lost at sea in the Catholic cemetery at Kylemore.

The Irish name for the island is &quot;Dairbhre&quot;, probably meaning &quot;oak isle&quot;. It was historically anglicized as &#x27;Dariry&#x27;.

==History==
Valentia was the eastern terminus of the first commercially viable transatlantic telegraph cable. The first attempt in 1857 to land a cable from Ballycarbery Strand on the mainland just east of Valentia Island ended in disappointment. After subsequent failures of cables landed at Knightstown in 1858 and Foilhommerum Bay in 1865, the vast endeavor finally resulted in commercially viable transatlantic telegraph communications from Foilhommerum Bay to Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland in 1866. Transatlantic telegraph cables operated from Valentia Island for one hundred years, ending with Western Union International terminating its cable operations in 1966.

Before the transatlantic telegraph, American longitude measurements had a uncertainty with respect to European longitudes. Because of the importance of accurate longitudes to safe navigation, the United States Coast Survey mounted a longitude expedition in 1866 to link longitudes in the United States accurately to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Benjamin Gould and his partner A. T. Mosman reached Valentia on 2 October 1866. They built a temporary longitude observatory beside the Foilhommerum Cable Station to support synchronized longitude observations with Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland. After many rainy and cloudy days, the first transatlantic longitude signals were exchanged between Foilhommerum and Heart&#x27;s Content on 24 October 1866.
The transatlantic cable is currently on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites. 

On 21 May 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh made his first landfall in Europe over Dingle Bay and Valentia Island on his solo flight from New York to Paris. On the 1927 Mercator chart used by the famous pilot, it was labeled Valencia.

In 1993 an undergraduate geology student discovered fossilised tetrapod trackways, footprints preserved in Devonian rocks, on the north coast of the island at Dohilla (). About 385 million years ago, a primitive vertebrate passed near a river margin in the sub-equatorial river basin that is now southwestern Ireland and left prints in the damp sand. The prints were preserved by silt and sand overlying them, and were converted to rock over geological time. The Valentia Island trackways are among the oldest signs of vertebrate life on land.

On 14 March 2021, Valentia Island was the site of the first walrus sighting in Ireland.

==Places of interest==

The combined features and history of the island make it an attractive tourist destination, easily accessible from the popular Ring of Kerry route.
*Geokaun Mountain and Fogher Cliffs: the highest mountain on Valentia Island and the sea cliffs of on its northern face.
*On the northeast of the island stands Glanleam House amid sub-tropical gardens. Protected by windbreaks from Atlantic gales and never touched by frost, these gardens provide the mildest microclimate in Ireland. Starting in the 1830s, Sir Peter George Fitzgerald, the 19th Knight of Kerry (1808–1880), planted these gardens and stocked them with a unique collection of rare and tender plants from the southern hemisphere, normally grown under glass in Ireland. The gardens are laid out in a naturalistic style as a series of walks. There are plants from South America, Australia, New Zealand (the tallest tree ferns in Europe), Chile and Japan. The gardens are memorialized in a selected golden-variegated &quot;Luma apiculata&quot; &quot;Glanleam Gold&quot; that originated as a sport in the garden. The gardens are open to the public.
*The slate quarry which reopened in 1998 provided slates for the British Houses of Parliament.
*The island also hosts a heritage centre which tells the story of the geology, human, natural and industrial history of the island, with exhibits on the Cable Station, the Marine Radio Station and the RNLI&#x27;s Valentia Lifeboat Station.
*The Telegraph Field (or Longitude Field) is the site of the first permanent communications link between Europe and North America Transatlantic telegraph cables operated from Valentia Island from 1866.

==Climate==
Valentia Island has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Sitting on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Valentia Island is, on average, the wettest weather station in Ireland. Despite its being on the same latitude as St. Anthony in Newfoundland on the opposite side of the Atlantic, it enjoys much milder winters thanks to the moderating effect of prevailing west or southwest winds, and the effects of the warming Gulf Stream current. Snow and frost are rare, and because of this the island can support many sub-tropical varieties of plants.
==Transport==
The R565 road is the main road onto the island. There are two connections to the Irish mainland, the fixed Maurice O&#x27;Neill Memorial Bridge to Portmagee, and a seasonal vehicle ferry service from Knightstown.

==Sport==
Valentia Young Islanders GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.

Valentia is a popular fishing location, and Valentia waters hold the Irish records for conger eel, red sea bream, Ray&#x27;s bream and lesser spotted dogfish.

==Notable people==

* Helen Blackburn who was a leading women&#x27;s rights campaigner in England was born here in 1842.
* Valentia was considered home to Mug Ruith, a powerful blind druid in Irish mythology.
* The O&#x27;Sullivans, headed by the O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, owned much of Valentia until the 17th century.
* The naturalist Maude Jane Delap lived and worked in Knightstown, carrying out research into the marine life surrounding Valentia and identifying many new species.
* Valentia is the home of former Gaelic footballer Mick O&#x27;Connell, and the birthplace of John J &quot;Sceilg&quot; O&#x27;Kelly, leader of Sinn Féin from 1926.
* Gaelic footballer Ger O&#x27;Driscoll was born on Valentia Island.
* The American solo rock climber Michael Reardon died on 13 July 2007 at the Fogher Cliffs of Valentia Island when he was swept out to sea following a climb.
* Gerald Spring Rice, 6th Baron Monteagle of Brandon was brought up on the island, as were many other members of the Spring Rice family.

<doc id="554877" wikidata="Q627902" url="?curid=554877" title="Thresher shark">
<text>Thresher sharks are large mackerel sharks of the family Alopiidae found in all temperate and tropical oceans of the world; the family contains three extant species, all within the genus Alopias.

All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable by the World Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN). All three are popular big-game sport fish, and additionally they are hunted commercially for their meat, livers (for shark liver oil), skin (for shagreen) and fins (for use in delicacies such as shark-fin soup).

Despite being active predatory fish, thresher sharks do not appear to be a threat to humans.

==Taxonomy==
The genus and family name derive from the Greek word , , meaning fox. As a result, the long-tailed or common thresher shark, &quot;Alopias vulpinus&quot;, is also known as the fox shark. The common name is derived from a distinctive, thresher-like tail or caudal fin which can be as long as the body of the shark itself.

===Species===
The three extant thresher shark species are all in the genus &quot;Alopias&quot;. The possible existence of a hitherto unrecognized fourth species was revealed during the course of a 1995 allozyme analysis by Blaise Eitner. This species is apparently found in the eastern Pacific off Baja California, and has previously been misidentified as the bigeye thresher. So far, it is only known from muscle samples from one specimen, and no aspect of its morphology has been documented.
==Phylogeny and evolution==

Based on cytochrome &quot;b&quot; genes, Martin and Naylor (1997) concluded the thresher sharks form a monophyletic sister group to the clade containing the families Cetorhinidae (basking shark) and Lamnidae (mackerel sharks). The megamouth shark (&quot;Megachasma pelagios&quot;) was placed as the next-closest relative to these taxa, though the phylogenetic position of that species has yet to be resolved with confidence. Cladistic analyses by Compagno (1991) based on morphological characters, and Shimada (2005) based on dentition, have both corroborated this interpretation.

Within the family, an analysis of allozyme variation by Eitner (1995) found the common thresher is the most basal member, with a sister relationship to a group containing the unrecognized fourth &quot;Alopias&quot; species and a clade comprising the bigeye and pelagic threshers. However, the position of the undescribed fourth species was only based on a single synapomorphy (derived group-defining character) in one specimen, so some uncertainty in its placement remains.

==Distribution and habitat==
Although occasionally sighted in shallow, inshore waters, thresher sharks are primarily pelagic; they prefer the open ocean, characteristically preferring water and less. Common threshers tend to be more prevalent in coastal waters over continental shelves. Common thresher sharks are found along the continental shelves of North America and Asia of the North Pacific, but are rare in the Central and Western Pacific. In the warmer waters of the Central and Western Pacific, bigeye and pelagic thresher sharks are more common. A thresher shark was seen on the live video feed from one of the ROVs monitoring BP&#x27;s Macondo oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. This is significantly deeper than the previously thought to be their limit.
A bigeye has also been found in the western Mediterranean, and so distribution may be wider than previously believed, or environmental factors may be forcing sharks to search for new territories.

==Anatomy and appearance==

Named for their exceptionally long, thresher-like heterocercal tail or &quot;caudal fins&quot; (which can be as long as the total body length), thresher sharks are active predators; the tail is used as a weapon to stun prey. The thresher shark has a short head and a cone-shaped nose. The mouth is generally small, and the teeth range in size from small to large. By far the largest of the three species is the common thresher, &quot;Alopias vulpinus&quot;, which may reach a length of and a mass of over . The bigeye thresher, &quot;A. superciliosus&quot;, is next in size, reaching a length of 4.9 m (16 ft); at just 3 m (10 ft), the pelagic thresher, &quot;A. pelagicus&quot;, is the smallest.

Thresher sharks are fairly slender, with small dorsal fins and large, recurved pectoral fins. With the exception of the bigeye thresher, these sharks have relatively small eyes positioned to the forward of the head. Coloration ranges from brownish, bluish or purplish gray dorsally with lighter shades ventrally.
The three species can be roughly distinguished by the primary color of the dorsal surface of the body. Common threshers are dark green, bigeye threshers are brown and pelagic threshers are generally blue. Lighting conditions and water clarity can affect how any one shark appears to an observer, but the color test is generally supported when other features are examined.

==Diet==
The thresher shark mainly feeds on schooling pelagic fish such as bluefish, juvenile tuna and mackerel, which they are known to follow into shallow waters, as well as squid and cuttlefish. Crustaceans and occasionally seabirds are also eaten. The thresher shark stuns its prey by using its elongated tail as a whipping weapon.

==Behavior==

Thresher sharks are solitary creatures that keep to themselves. It is known that thresher populations of the Indian Ocean are separated by depth and space according to sex. Some species however do occasionally hunt in a group of two or three contrary to their solitary nature. All species are noted for their highly migratory or oceanodromous habits. When hunting schooling fish, thresher sharks are known to &quot;whip&quot; the water. The elongated tail is used to swat smaller fish, stunning them before feeding. Thresher sharks are one of the few shark species known to jump fully out of the water, using their elongated tail to propel them out of the water, making turns like dolphins; this behavior is called breaching.
==Endothermy==
Two species of the thresher have been identified as having a modified circulatory system that acts as a counter-current heat exchanger, which allows them to retain metabolic heat. Mackerel sharks (family Lamnidae) have a similar homologous structure to this which is more extensively developed. This structure is a strip of red muscle along each of its flanks, which has a tight network of blood vessels that transfer metabolic heat inward towards the core of the shark, allowing it to maintain and regulate its body heat.

==Reproduction==

No distinct breeding season is observed by thresher sharks. Fertilization and embryonic development occur internally; this ovoviviparous or live-bearing mode of reproduction results in a small litter (usually two to four) of large well-developed pups, up to at birth in thintail threshers. The young fish exhaust their yolk sacs while still inside the mother, at which time they begin feasting on the mother&#x27;s unfertilized eggs; this is known as oophagy.

Thresher sharks are slow to mature; males reach sexual maturity between seven and thirteen years of age and females between eight and fourteen years in bigeye threshers. They may live for 20 years or more.

In October 2013, the first picture of a thresher shark giving birth was taken off the coast of the Philippines.

==Fisheries==
Thresher sharks are classified as prized game fish in the United States and South Africa. Common thresher sharks are the target of a popular recreational fishery off Baja, Mexico.

==Status==
Because of their low fecundity, thresher sharks are highly vulnerable to overfishing. All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable to extinction by the World Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN).

<text>Light &amp; Magic is the second studio album by English electronic music band Ladytron. It was released in the United States on 17 September 2002 by Emperor Norton and in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2002 by Telstar Records. The album has been reissued multiple times, most recently by Nettwerk in January 2011.

An earlier version of the song &quot;NuHorizons&quot; appeared as a B-side to the band&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;The Way That I Found You&quot;, under the title &quot;Holiday 601&quot;. &quot;Seventeen&quot; is part of the soundtrack to the 2003 film &quot;Party Monster&quot;, while its instrumental was used in television advertisements for Christina Aguilera&#x27;s 2008 fragrance Inspire.

&quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Light &amp; Magic&quot; at number 14 on its Top 41 Albums of the Year list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the album on its 50 Best Albums of 2002 list. British dance music magazine &quot;Muzik&quot; named it the best electropop album of 2002. &quot;NME&quot; included it at number 41 on their Albums and Tracks of the Year for 2002 list.

==&quot;Light &amp; Magic (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot;==
On 1 September 2009, Redbird Records and Cobraside Distribution released a compilation of remixes, B-sides and rarities titled &quot;Light &amp; Magic (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot;. The cover is the negative of the US cover for &quot;Light &amp; Magic&quot;. Nettwerk reissued &quot;Light &amp; Magic (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot; on 20 December 2011 with a slightly altered track listing, removing &quot;Cease2xist&quot; (Instrumental 2002) and adding &quot;Flicking Your Switch&quot; (Erol Alkan Remix).

<text>Type O Negative was an American gothic/doom metal band formed in Brooklyn, New York City in 1989 by Peter Steele (bass, lead vocals), Kenny Hickey (guitar, co-lead vocals), Josh Silver (keyboards, backing vocals), and Sal Abruscato (drums, percussion), who was later replaced by Johnny Kelly. Their lyrical emphasis on themes of romance, depression, and death resulted in the nickname &quot;the Drab Four&quot; (in homage to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Fab Four&quot; moniker). The band went platinum with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, and gold with 1996&#x27;s &quot;October Rust&quot;, and gained a fanbase through seven studio albums, two best-of compilations, and concert DVDs.

Steele died on April 14, 2010, at the age of 48; some sources report the cause of death as heart failure brought on by an aortic aneurysm, while others list sepsis caused by diverticulitis. Seven months after Steele&#x27;s death, the surviving members of Type O Negative announced that they would not continue as a band.

==History==

===Origins (1989–1991)===
Type O Negative was formed after frontman Peter Steele&#x27;s previous band, Carnivore, broke up. Steele formed a new band with childhood friends Sal Abruscato, Josh Silver, and Kenny Hickey, which they initially named Repulsion. The band later changed their name to Sub-Zero because another band with the name Repulsion already existed, then changed it again one final time, settling on the name Type O Negative. Steele was still tied to the multi-album contract he had made with Roadrunner Records during his time in Carnivore, despite the fact the band had broken up; after receiving a demo from Type O Negative, Roadrunner decided not to drop Steele, and the band signed to the record label in 1991. Shortly after signing, they released their debut, &quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot;.

===&quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot; and &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot; (1991–1992)===
Type O Negative&#x27;s first album, &quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot;, incorporated dragging Black Sabbath-esque dirge riffs, maniacal hardcore outbursts, and droning industrial and gothic atmospheres. The songs were long, multi-part theatrical epics, with lyrics loosely surrounding a story involving a man enacting revenge on a cheating girlfriend before ultimately contemplating his actions and committing suicide.

They began creating a new album, with the idea of presenting it as a live album. The subsequent 1992 album was entitled &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot; and a warning label was put on the album cover: &quot;Not Live at Brighton Beach&quot;. The album contains faux-live recordings of songs from &quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot;, as well as previously unreleased songs such as &quot;Are You Afraid&quot; and &quot;Hey Pete&quot; (a cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Hey Joe&quot; with altered lyrics) and Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;.

===&quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; and &quot;October Rust&quot; (1993–1998)===
Type O Negative&#x27;s third album, &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, was released in 1993 to critical and listener acclaim, and eventually became the first record for Roadrunner to reach certified gold status in the US. The newfound success brought by the album&#x27;s release reportedly put a lot of pressure on the band; initially, Peter Steele expressed disinterest in touring nationally. Monte Conner, who at the time was Vice President of A&amp;R at Roadrunner, said in a 2018 interview with Revolver Magazine, &quot;There was a lot of pressure for him to take the band to the next level, but he didn&#x27;t want to quit his job... There was a point where it looked like the band might break up.&quot;

&quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; mostly addressed loneliness and heartbreak, with songs like &quot;Too Late: Frozen&quot;, &quot;Blood &amp; Fire&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Lose You&quot;. The organ-driven &quot;Set Me on Fire&quot; is vintage 1960s garage rock, while &quot;Summer Breeze&quot; covered the 1972 Seals and Crofts hit. &quot;Christian Woman&quot; and &quot;Black No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All)&quot; became the most popular tracks, after having been edited down to radio-friendly lengths (the album versions were 9 and 11 minutes long respectively). In order to promote the album, Type O Negative embarked on a two-year world tour. During this time, the band was featured on MTV, VH1, and in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In the midst of this media blitz, drummer Sal Abruscato quit the band to join another Brooklyn quartet, Life of Agony. Johnny Kelly, the band&#x27;s drum technician, was therefore hired as a full-fledged member. &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; was re-released a year after the original release in a limited-edition Digipak form, including eight of the musical tracks from the original (omitting the &quot;filler&quot; tracks) and the previously unreleased &quot;Suspended in Dusk&quot;.

Type O&#x27;s &quot;October Rust&quot; picked up where &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; left off, exploring themes of sex, nature and sensuality, first in a humorous sense on the single &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; and then taken much darker with &quot;Love You to Death&quot;. This record also saw a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; as well as the fan favorite, semi-serene &quot;Green Man&quot;. While not quite as successful as &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, the album was certified gold in the US, and was the first Type O Negative album to enter the top half of the Billboard Top 200, debuting at No. 42.

===&quot;World Coming Down&quot; and &quot;The Least Worst of Type O Negative&quot; (1999–2001)===
With the completion of another successful world tour, writing for a fifth album began. In the period immediately following the release of &quot;October Rust&quot;, resulting in 1999&#x27;s &quot;World Coming Down&quot; (working titles included &quot;Prophets of Doom&quot; and &quot;Aggroculture&quot;).&quot;World Coming Down&quot; debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard Top 200 charts. &quot;World Coming Down&quot; featured a much darker, bleak tone than its predecessors, having been written after a series of deaths in frontman Peter Steele&#x27;s family.

A best of album followed in 2000, entitled &quot;The Least Worst of Type O Negative.&quot; Although most songs appear on previous albums, many are unreleased remixes or B-sides of previously released singles. Along with these songs are some unreleased numbers from the &quot;World Coming Down&quot; sessions, the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; by Black Sabbath (Peter Steele&#x27;s version with different lyrics, written from the perspective of Satan), and a cleaner version of &quot;Hey Pete&quot; (originally released on the mock live album &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot;).

===&quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot; and &quot;Dead Again&quot; (2002–2009)===
Type O Negative&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot; (originally called &quot;The Dream Is Dead&quot; after the closing song), was released in 2003. For this album, the band picked up the pace of their sound from the dirgeful slowness of &quot;World Coming Down&quot;. Songs such as &quot;Todd&#x27;s Ship Gods (Above All Things)&quot;, &quot;(We Were) Electrocute&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Me&quot; convey the band&#x27;s classic elements of melody, though the song lengths were much shorter on this outing, the longest being the 7 and a half-minute &quot;How Could She?&quot;, a list of female character names from television shows. The album includes a humorous cover of the song &quot;Angry Inch&quot; from the musical &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch,&quot; detailing a sex change operation gone terribly wrong. Type O Negative left Roadrunner after the album&#x27;s release, having fulfilled their contract for the label.

In June 2004, Type O Negative signed to the Steamhammer imprint of SPV Records. Their only album for the label, &quot;Dead Again&quot;, was released in 2007. &quot;Dead Again&quot; debuted at No. 27 in the United States, the band&#x27;s highest chart debut to date. They also continued to tour through October of that year, including a performance at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany.

===Peter Steele&#x27;s death, the end of Type O Negative and aftermath (2010–present)===
On April 14, 2010, frontman and bassist Peter Steele died, reportedly from heart failure. The cause of death was later reported to be sepsis, caused by diverticulitis. The following statement concerning Steele was released April 15 on the band&#x27;s official website:

In a November 2010 interview with &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine, Johnny Kelly and Kenny Hickey confirmed that following Steele&#x27;s death, Type O Negative had split up.

Roadrunner Records released a box set of all the band&#x27;s albums (with the exception of &quot;Dead Again&quot;) for Back to Black Friday 2011, a spinoff of Record Store Day, on November 25, 2011. Each vinyl cover has no text and &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot; uses its original cover art. The box set also contains various bumper stickers related to the band.

In a June 2023 interview with &quot;Loaded Radio&quot;, Hickey was asked about the future of Type O Negative. He said that he was against the idea of continuing the band with a new vocalist, noting, &quot;People have approached us to try and reform the band with a singer and go on the road...We personally don&#x27;t think Peter is replaceable by anyone and it just wouldn&#x27;t work.&quot; He did, however, mention that he would not be against the idea of some kind of tribute show with guest musicians saying &quot;If somebody had the idea and got it together and got the logistics together, sure – I would be into that.&quot; He also mentioned that Johnny Kelly would enjoy performing for a tribute show, but Josh Silver would more than likely not participate due to his current job as a paramedic. Kelly has also stated that a Type O Negative reunion without Steele would never happen, but believes the latter &quot;deserves some kind of celebration&quot; and did not rule out a tribute show.

== Musical style, influences and legacy ==
Type O Negative&#x27;s musical style has been described as gothic metal and doom metal. Regarding the band&#x27;s influences, Johnny Kelly has stated, &quot;The common denominators, for certain, were The Beatles and Black Sabbath. Those are the two bands that everybody agreed on. They were favorites. Everybody was into different, various things. Those were the two that there was never an argument when one of their songs was being played.&quot;

Additionally, Steele cited Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, Einstürzende Neubauten, Curve, Duran Duran, the Cure, Depeche Mode, Devo, and Laibach, as personal influences. In the past, Steele and his bandmates expressed the frontman&#x27;s appreciation for shoegaze acts Lush and My Bloody Valentine and for synth-pop bands A Flock of Seagulls and Simple Minds. According to Kelly, he and Josh Silver were influenced by grunge bands Alice In Chains and Soundgarden.

The band has gone on to influence numerous metal acts including Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet for My Valentine and Trivium, the latter having covered their single I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Me.

==Soundtracks and covers==

Type O Negative&#x27;s songs have appeared in numerous motion pictures, including &quot;Blood and Fire (Out of the Ashes Remix)&quot; on the 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; movie soundtrack (also on the bonus CD of &quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot;), &quot;Love You to Death&quot; in &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot;, &quot;Everyone I Love Is Dead&quot; in &quot;&quot;, &quot;(We Were) Electrocute&quot; in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason,&quot; and &quot;Summer Breeze&quot; in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. As a result of Howard Stern being a self-professed fan, &quot;Private Parts: The Album&quot; contains &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; with the band playing music and Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. &quot;Haunted&quot; also appears on &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; &quot;soundtrack CD&quot; (the album&#x27;s concept was to contain songs from &quot;a tape that was found in the woods with the students&#x27; gear&quot;). In 1998, Arrow Videos made their own version of the 1922 classic horror film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; by simply overdubbing the silent film with a soundtrack consisting entirely of Type O Negative tracks, taken from the first four albums. This version is now on DVD from DigiView Entertainment, a company that makes budget-priced DVDs. It also has an introduction by actor David Carradine.

In other media, the computer game &quot;Descent 2&quot; features a shortened, instrumental version of the track &quot;Haunted&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Descent 2: The Vertigo Series&quot; contains a full-length version of the instrumental; the compilation &quot;Duke Nukem: Music to Score By&quot; features &quot;Cinnamon Girl (Extended Depression Mix)&quot;; &quot;Love You to Death&quot; in the computer game &quot;Blood&quot;; &quot;Out of the Fire&quot; from the &quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot; bonus CD was a theme created for wrestler Kane, but was never used. The opening two seconds of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Me&quot; were used as a frequent sample in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, on the Liberty Rock Radio Station, and 2012 video game &quot;The Darkness II&quot; features Type O Negative&#x27;s &quot;Black No. 1&quot; in its multiplayer lobby, played at random amongst other songs.

Type O Negative performed and recorded numerous covers. The Doors&#x27; &quot;Light My Fire&quot; has been covered live numerous times, mostly during the 1990s. Steele has described the song as &quot;probably the greatest song ever written&quot; before apologizing for having &quot;destroyed it&quot;. Seals and Crofts&#x27; &quot;Summer Breeze&quot; appears on &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; appears on &quot;October Rust&quot;. The tongue-in-cheek &quot;Angry Inch&quot; (from &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;) appears on &quot;Life is Killing Me&quot;. &quot;World Coming Down&quot; includes a Beatles medley consisting of &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, and &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;. Other covers include a rendition of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;N.I.B.&quot;; Status Quo&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; with Ozzy Osbourne, two versions of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; (one with the original lyrics and one rewritten by Peter Steele to be from Satan&#x27;s perspective), Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (rewritten as &quot;Hey Pete&quot;); the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Highway Star&quot;, and Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. A medley of Santana&#x27;s &quot;Evil Ways&quot;, &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;, and &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; are also available on the CD accompanying the DVD &quot;Symphony for the Devil&quot;. The 2007 tour song set started with a cover of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; from the Beatles.

&quot;In the Flesh&quot;, originally written by Pink Floyd from their album &quot;The Wall&quot;, is another song that Type O Negative covered, used to open their 1999 World Tour. This version can be seen on the live DVD &quot;Symphony for the Devil&quot;. Also on the same DVD, in &quot;Too Late: Frozen&quot;, the intro began with Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Aqualung&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Northampton&quot; (CL/CA-26) was the lead in service with the United States Navy. She was commissioned in 1930, originally classified a light cruiser because of her thin armor but later reclassified a heavy cruiser because of her 8-inch guns. During World War II she served in the Pacific and was sunk by Japanese torpedoes during the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November 1942. She was named after the city of Northampton, Massachusetts, the home of former President Calvin Coolidge.

== Construction ==
&quot;Northampton&quot; was laid down on 12 April 1928, by Bethlehem Steel Corp.&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 5 September 1929; sponsored by Grace Coolidge (wife of the former president); and commissioned on 17 May 1930, Captain (later Vice Admiral) Walter N. Vernou in command.

== Inter-war period ==

Joining the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Northampton&quot; made a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean during the summer of 1930, then participated in the fleet training schedule which took her to the Caribbean, the Panama Canal Zone, and, occasionally, into the Pacific for exercises with other cruisers and ships of all types. Redesignated CA-26 in 1931 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, she operated primarily in the Pacific from 1932, homeported at San Pedro, and later at Pearl Harbor. &quot;Northampton&quot; was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940.

== World War II ==

&quot;Northampton&quot; was at sea with Admiral William Halsey, Jr. in task force during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, returning to port the next day. On 9 December, the force sortied to search northeast of Oahu, then swept south to Johnston Island, then north again to hunt the enemy west of Lisianski Island and Midway Atoll. On 11 December, was damaged when it collided with &quot;Northampton&quot; during underway refueling.

Through January 1942, &quot;Northampton&quot; joined in such searches until detached with to bombard Wotje on 1 February. The bombardment not only demolished buildings and fuel dumps on the island, but also sank two Japanese ships. A similar assault was fired against Wake Island on 24 February when, despite serious enemy counterfire, the guns of &quot;Northampton&quot; and her force started large fires on the island and sank a dredge in the lagoon. As &quot;Northampton&quot; retired from the island, enemy seaplanes, landbased planes, and patrol craft attacked, but all were destroyed or repulsed.

On 4 March, the force launched aircraft for a strike on Marcus Island, then turned east for Pearl Harbor. Early in April, &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s task force, including &quot;Northampton&quot;, sortied once again, and joined force for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo 18 April. Once again the ships replenished at Pearl Harbor, then sailed for the Southwest Pacific, arriving just after the battle of the Coral Sea. Returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Northampton&quot; prepared for the action soon to come at the battle of Midway, when she screened &quot;Enterprise&quot;. On 4–5 June, the American carriers launched their planes to win a great victory, turning the Japanese back in mid-Pacific, and dealing them a tremendous blow by sinking four carriers. Throughout the Battle of Midway, &quot;Northampton&quot; protected her carrier and with her returned undamaged to Pearl Harbor on 13 June.

In mid-August, &quot;Northampton&quot; sailed for the Southwest Pacific to join in the Guadalcanal operation. She patrolled southeast of San Cristobal, where on 15 September her force was attacked by submarines, which sank and damaged , and another torpedo hit badly damaged only off &quot;Northampton&quot;″s port beam. Now sailing with &quot;Hornet&quot;, &quot;Northampton&quot; screened the carrier during attacks on Bougainville Island on 5 October.

During the battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, which took place without surface contact with the enemy, &quot;Northampton&quot; went to the aid of &quot;Hornet&quot;, mortally wounded by enemy aircraft, and provided antiaircraft cover while attempting to take the stricken carrier in tow. Obviously doomed, the carrier was abandoned after failing to be scuttled and later finished by Japanese destroyer torpedo and gunfire, while the American force retired to the southwest.

=== Loss at the Battle of Tassafaronga ===
&quot;Northampton&quot; next operated with a cruiser-destroyer force, to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing their troops on Guadalcanal. The Battle of Tassafaronga began 40 minutes before midnight on 30 November 1942, when three American destroyers made a surprise torpedo attack on the Japanese. All American ships then opened fire, which the startled enemy did not return for seven minutes. Two of the American cruisers took torpedo hits within the space of a minute, and 10 minutes later, another was hit, all being forced to retire from the action. &quot;Northampton&quot; and , with six destroyers, continued the fierce action.

Close to the end of the engagement, &quot;Northampton&quot; was struck by two torpedoes, which tore a huge hole in her port side, ripping away decks and bulkheads. Flaming oil sprayed over the ship; she took on water rapidly and began to list. Three hours later, as she began to sink stern-first, she had to be abandoned. So orderly and controlled was the process that loss of life was surprisingly light. Most of the survivors were picked up within an hour by destroyers of Task Force 67. About 40 crewmen spent the rest of the night in two life rafts. Those survivors were later rescued by torpedo boat &quot;PT-109&quot; and landed on Tulagi Island. U. S. Navy archives contain a photo of &quot;PT-109&quot; entering the anchorage at Tulagi, her topside crowded by &quot;Northampton&quot; survivors, some of them seriously wounded or dying. Five months after this battle &quot;PT-109&quot; got a new skipper: Lt.jg John F. Kennedy. It was a tactical defeat, as three cruisers had been severely damaged and &quot;Northampton&quot; lost in exchange for the loss of only one Japanese destroyer; nevertheless the Japanese had been denied a major reinforcement.

The senior officer killed on &quot;Northampton&quot; during the battle of Tassafaronga was Chief Engineer, Commander (select) Hilan Ebert of Alliance, Ohio. Ebert was awarded the Navy Cross. In honor of Commander Ebert, the destroyer escort was launched 11 May 1944 by Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Tampa, Florida; sponsored by the widow of Commander Ebert; Mrs. Hilan Ebert. Commanding officer of the ship, Captain Willard A. Kitts survived the sinking and was also decorated the Navy Cross for handling the evacuation of &quot;Northampton&quot;.

 rescued survivors of &quot;Northampton&quot;, ingeniously using cork-floated cargo nets to take great groups of them from the water.

== Awards ==
&quot;Northampton&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

== In fiction ==

&quot;Northampton&quot; plays a prominent role in Herman Wouk&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; as Victor Henry&#x27;s first seagoing command in many years. The ship&#x27;s operations in the book are identical to those in its real life. The novel includes a discussion of the design compromises imposed on the &quot;Northampton&quot;-class by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ship also figured prominently in the War and Remembrance (miniseries).

&quot;Northampton&quot; was also used as a reference in the 1937 film &quot;Navy Blue and Gold&quot;, in which James Stewart played a seaman who was stationed on &quot;Northampton&quot; before being awarded an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Stewart&#x27;s character mentioned that he played football for &quot;Northampton&quot;, and that she was the fleet football champion.

<text>The Skellig Islands (), historically &quot;the Skellocks&quot;, are two small, steep, and rocky islands lying about west of Bolus Head off the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. The larger of the two is Skellig Michael (also known as Great Skellig), famous for an early Christian monastery that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Together with Little Skellig, they make up a Important Bird Area.

==Skellig Michael==

Also known as Great Skellig (&quot;Sceilig Mhichíl&quot; in Irish), this is the larger of the two islands, with two peaks rising to over above sea level. With a sixth-century Christian monastery perched at above sea level on a ledge close to the top of the lower peak, Great Skellig is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Birdwatch Ireland were concerned that the Irish government allowed filming on a seabird sanctuary without third party consent. During the 2014 nesting season, black-legged kittiwake chicks in nests were swept into the sea by the downdraught from a helicopter and devoured by gulls.

==Little Skellig==

The smaller of the two islands is Little Skellig (&quot;Sceilig Bheag&quot; in Irish). () It is Ireland&#x27;s largest northern gannet (&quot;Morus bassanus&quot;) colony with almost 30,000 pairs, and is closed to the public. It is also one of the world&#x27;s largest northern gannet colonies, and is of international importance. The island&#x27;s highest point is above sea level and is located approximately east-northeast of the island of Skellig Michael.

==Wildlife==
Both of the Skellig islands are known for their seabird colonies, and together compose one of the most important seabird sites in Ireland, both for the population size and for the species diversity. The islands have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support breeding populations of several species of seabirds. Among the breeding birds are European storm petrel, northern gannet, northern fulmar, Manx shearwater, black-legged kittiwake, common guillemot, razorbill and Atlantic puffin (with 4,000 or more puffins on Great Skellig alone). Red-billed choughs and peregrine falcons can also be seen.

The surrounding waters have abundant wildlife with many Grey seals. Basking sharks, minke whales, dolphins (Delphinidae), beaked whales and leatherback sea turtles have also been recorded. The islands have many interesting recreational diving sites due to the clear water, an abundance of life, and underwater cliffs down to 60 m (200 feet).

==In popular culture==
The final scene of &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; was shot on Skellig in July 2015, with additional filming taking place there in September 2015 for &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, the following film in the series. The remains of the Skellig Michael monastery appear in the film, representing an ancient Jedi temple.

Earlier, the Skellig Islands served as a location in the Werner Herzog 1976 movie &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;, where the islands feature in one of the prophecies by the seer Hias.

Certain scenes from the 2012 movie &quot;Byzantium&quot; were also filmed here.

In the &quot;Witcher&quot; fantasy literature series and its related video games, &#x27;Skellige&#x27; is an archipelago visited by protagonist Geralt of Rivia. In the video game &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;, the inhabitants of the islands can be heard speaking with an Irish accent.

<text>Ellen R. Malcolm (born February 2, 1947) is an American activist with a long career in American politics, particularly in political fundraising. She founded EMILY&#x27;s List in 1985 and served as its president until 2010.

== Early life ==
Malcolm&#x27;s great-grandfather is A. Ward Ford, an IBM founder.

Malcolm grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, the daughter of parents who met while working in the sales department at IBM. After her father died when she was 8 months old, she became the heir to an IBM fortune, which she was to inherit at age 21. Malcolm attended Montclair Kimberley Academy, graduating in the class of 1965. Upon entering Hollins College, an all women&#x27;s school, in 1965 Malcolm says she was &quot;apolitical&quot; and didn&#x27;t even realize the country was at war. She went to work for the campaign of Eugene McCarthy in 1968. McCarthy was a Democratic and anti-war senator for the state of Minnesota. After he won the popular vote in the Democratic presidential primary, Malcolm was eager to become more involved in politics. Malcolm cites the Vietnam War, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the riots that followed, the assassination of Robert Kennedy, and the counterculture of the &#x27;60s as the factors that led to her political awakening. Though both of her parents and much of her community were Republican, Malcolm says the turmoil of the time was shocking, and she felt compelled to help make a change. In the summer of 1968 she began volunteering at the Manpower Development Program in Newark. After graduating from Hollins College in 1969, she worked for Common Cause in the 1970s.

== Political activism ==
Malcolm began working for Common Cause in the very early stages of the organization. She was charged with overseeing a number of volunteers who were putting pressure on representatives to end the Vietnam War. Malcolm credits her time at Common Cause with teaching her the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of campaigning.

Malcolm became the press secretary of the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus after leaving Common Cause. Through her work at the NWPC, she came to know Lael Stegall, the development director for the organization. Stegall expressed her interest to advise wealthy philanthropic women on where to direct their money. Malcolm, inheriting her fortune at age 21, was just such a woman. Malcolm&#x27;s interest in giving money to worthy non-profits conflicted with her desire to advance her career based on her own merit, rather than her deep pockets. With Stegall as the executive director, together they started the Windom Fund in 1980.

After leaving the NWPC in 1979, Malcolm found work as the press secretary for Esther Peterson, who was then the special assistant for consumer affairs for the Carter administration. Malcolm cites both Peterson and Millie Jeffries, the head of the NWPC, as major influences on her political beliefs.

In 1982, Malcolm became involved with the campaign of Harriet Woods, a Democratic woman running for a spot in the US Senate. Woods lost the seat due to running out of funds a few weeks before the election, causing her television ads to lose air time. Because of her involvement in the campaign, Malcolm discovered that not a single woman had been elected to the US Senate, instead they had all been appointed. Malcolm identified the main cause of this to be insufficient funds for women&#x27;s campaigns.

In 1983, Malcolm hosted a breakfast for a small number of women that she knew were interested in political activism. Together, they identified a clear goal: use early funds or seed money to elect a woman to the US Senate. This was the beginning of EMILY&#x27;s List (Early Money Is Like Yeast), which Malcolm founded in 1985. EMILY&#x27;s list effectively set up a donor network composed mostly of women who, in exchange for their money, got information about whom to vote for from people they knew had similar interests to themselves. These interests were clear: elect pro-choice democratic women to public office.

In 2007, she served as co-chair of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s election campaign, and in 2010 she was appointed to the National Park Foundation Board of Directors.

Malcolm served as president of America Coming Together from 2003 to 2004.

Malcolm is Chair Emerita of the board of EMILY&#x27;s list, former Chair of the National Partnership for Women and Families, and a former member of the Board of Directors for the National Park Foundation.

== Book ==

Malcolm, along with Craig Unger, wrote &quot;When Women Win: EMILY&#x27;s List and the Rise of Women in American Politics&quot;, published in 2016.

== Accolades ==
She was named one of the Women of the Year by &quot;Glamour&quot; (1992), one of America&#x27;s most influential women by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1998), one of the 100 Most Important Women in America by &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; (1999), one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Women Who Made American Political History (2017), and Most Valuable Player by the American Association of Political Consultants, and given the Margaret Sanger Award by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

<doc id="554903" wikidata="Q7179403" url="?curid=554903" title="Petty officer third class">
<text>A Petty officer third class is a non-commissioned officer in some navies and coast guards.

==By country==

===United States===

Petty officer third class is the fourth enlisted rank in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, above seaman and below petty officer second class, and is the lowest rank of non-commissioned officer, equivalent to a corporal in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Petty officer third class shares the same pay grade as senior airman in the Air Force, which no longer has an NCO rank corresponding with E-4. Specialists in the Army are not recognized as NCOs either, even though they are also in the E-4 pay grade.

====History====
Unlike seaman and lower ranks, a sailor&#x27;s advancement to petty officer third class is not automatic given time in service, but is also contingent on performance evaluations by their superiors and rate examinations (tests of specialty knowledge), except for certain technical ratings which carry automatic advancement to PO3 after successful completion of that rating&#x27;s class &quot;A&quot; school and fulfillment of time in rate requirements. The advancement cycle is currently every six months. Only a certain number of billets (job openings for a given rate) open up biannually and all seamen compete for promotion. The top scorers are chosen for advancement, but only in sufficient numbers to fill the billets available.

Petty officers serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors who rate below them, there is no such thing as an undesignated petty officer. Every petty officer has both a rate and rating (job, similar to an MOS or AFSC in other branches). The pay grade and rating combined are known collectively as a sailor&#x27;s rate. A petty officer&#x27;s full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a petty officer third class who has the rating of Aviation Structural Mechanic is called an Aviation Structural Mechanic Third Class. The term petty officer is only used in abstract, the general sense, when referring to a group of petty officers of different ratings, or when the petty officer&#x27;s rating is unknown.

Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as AM for aviation structural mechanic. When combined with the petty officer level, this gives the shorthand for the petty officer&#x27;s rate, such as AM3 for aviation structural mechanic third class. It is common practice to refer to the petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence, such as printing an inscription on awards. Often the petty officer is referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus AM3 Anderson would be called AM3. To address a petty officer, one would say, &quot;Petty Officer Smith&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot;, or &quot;sailor&quot;, the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rate than the petty officer. It is uncommon to address a petty officer as simply &quot;petty officer&quot; the way one might address an NCO in the Army as &quot;sergeant&quot;. It is also acceptable, though archaic, to address a petty officer or chief petty officer of any grade as &quot;Mister Smith&quot; or &quot;Miss Smith&quot;. In the modern navy, however, the use of &quot;miss&quot; or &quot;mister&quot; is common only in reference to junior commissioned officers or warrant officers.

The rank insignia for a petty officer third class is a white perched eagle and one specialty mark (rating) above a chevron. On dress uniforms the symbol for the petty officer&#x27;s rating is placed between the two. On the dress white uniform, the eagle, rating, and chevron are navy blue. This has led to the eagle, and even the entire rating badge, being commonly referred to as &quot;the crow.&quot; On the dress blue uniform, the eagle and rating are white, and the chevron is red. The insignia worn on working uniforms, such as coveralls and the naval working uniform, and metal rate devices, like those worn on the collar of the naval service uniform, have the rating symbol omitted.

When a sailor is advanced to petty officer third class, it is traditional for sailors already holding that or a higher enlisted rank to &quot;tack on the crow.&quot; Originally this custom involved a recently advanced sailor&#x27;s fellow petty officers taking turns stitching the new rank insignia on the sailor&#x27;s uniform, the rushed needlework referred to as &quot;tacking.&quot; More recently the custom has taken on a different form, being done with a gesture ranging from a light tap to a hard punch over the new petty officer&#x27;s sleeve insignia. This, however, has lately been deemed &quot;hazing,&quot; and as such individuals involved in this practice can be subject to disciplinary action. This disciplinary action often includes the individual being demoted. The &quot;tacking on of the crow&quot; has also been known to cause serious injury. It is not just patches that are &quot;tacked on,&quot; but also metal insignia in the chest area that have sharp attachment pins, such as the insignia for surface warfare or submarine service. A hard enough punch can cause the attachment points to pierce a sailor&#x27;s skin. Commanding officers are also known to direct the ship corpsman to perform physical exams for possible abuse and to report all injuries to newly promoted personnel, so punishment cannot be avoided.

====High year tenure====
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s high year tenure policy has made the good conduct variation for a petty officer third class all but obsolete. Among enlisted sailors 12 consecutive years of good conduct (categorized as no court-martial convictions or non-judicial punishments) entitles the sailor to wear a good conduct variation of their rank insignia, with the normally red chevrons under the specialty mark and perched eagle worn as gold and the eagle itself worn as silver. However, the high year tenure initiative mandates that a petty officer third class may only have ten years of service. If a PO3 fails to make petty officer second class within those ten years, the petty officer is involuntarily separated for not meeting advancement requirements. This same restriction has been imposed upon the rates of petty officer second class and first class, allowing 16 years of service to a PO2 before advancement must be attained, and 22 years of service to a petty officer first class. All of these initiatives, however, may be waived in the event the sailor holds critical training qualifications, Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) job codes, or special clearances. Today the few instances in which a PO3 has gold chevrons are usually instances in which a sailor has previous military service. The single gold chevron is extremely rare, but can still be found in Navy uniform shops.

All U.S. Coast Guard petty officers wear red chevrons and red service stripes until the rate of chief petty officer, who wear gold chevrons and service stripes.

<doc id="554905" wikidata="Q733109" url="?curid=554905" title="Tidal bore">
<text>A tidal bore, often simply given as bore in context, is a tidal phenomenon in which the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travels up a river or narrow bay, reversing the direction of the river or bay&#x27;s current. It is a strong tide that pushes up the river, against the current.

== Description== 
Bores occur in relatively few locations worldwide, usually in areas with a large tidal range (typically more than between high and low tide) and where incoming tides are funneled into a shallow, narrowing river or lake via a broad bay. The funnel-like shape not only increases the tidal range, but it can also decrease the duration of the flood tide, down to a point where the flood appears as a sudden increase in the water level. A tidal bore takes place during the flood tide and never during the ebb tide.
A tidal bore may take on various forms, ranging from a single breaking wavefront with a somewhat like a hydraulic jump⁠to undular bores, comprising a smooth wavefront followed by a train of secondary waves known as whelps. Large bores can be particularly unsafe for shipping but also present opportunities for river surfing.

Two key features of a tidal bore are the intense turbulence and turbulent mixing generated during the bore propagation, as well as its rumbling noise. The visual observations of tidal bores highlight the turbulent nature of the surging waters. The tidal bore induces a strong turbulent mixing in the estuarine zone, and the effects may be felt along considerable distances. The velocity observations indicate a rapid deceleration of the flow associated with the passage of the bore as well as large velocity fluctuations. A tidal bore creates a powerful roar that combines the sounds caused by the turbulence in the bore front and whelps, entrained air bubbles in the bore roller, sediment erosion beneath the bore front and of the banks, scouring of shoals and bars, and impacts on obstacles. The bore rumble is heard far away because its low frequencies can travel over long distances. The low-frequency sound is a characteristic feature of the advancing roller in which the air bubbles entrapped in the large-scale eddies are acoustically active and play the dominant role in the rumble-sound generation.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;bore&quot; derives through Old English from the Old Norse word &quot;bára&quot;, meaning &quot;wave&quot; or &quot;swell.&quot;

==Effects==
Tidal bores can be dangerous. Certain rivers such as the Seine in France, the Petitcodiac River in Canada, and the Colorado River in Mexico to name a few, have had a sinister reputation in association with tidal bores. In China, despite warning signs erected along the banks of the Qiantang River, a number of fatalities occur each year by people who take too much risk with the bore. The tidal bores affect the shipping and navigation in the estuarine zone, for example, in Papua New Guinea (in the Fly and Bamu Rivers), Malaysia (the Benak in the Batang Lupar), and India (the Hooghly River bore).

On the other hand, tidal bore-affected estuaries are rich feeding zones and breeding grounds of several forms of wildlife. The estuarine zones are the spawning and breeding grounds of several native fish species, while the aeration induced by the tidal bore contributes to the abundant growth of many species of fish and shrimp (for example in the Rokan River, Indonesia). The tidal bores also provide opportunity for recreational inland surfing, such as the Seven Ghosts bore on the Kampar River, Indonesia.

===Scientific studies===
Scientific studies have been carried out at the River Dee in Wales in the United Kingdom, the Garonne and Sélune in France, the Daly River in Australia, and the Qiantang River estuary in China. The force of the tidal bore flow often poses a challenge to scientific measurements, as evidenced by a number of field work incidents in the River Dee, Rio Mearim, Daly River, and Sélune River.

==Rivers and bays with tidal bores==
Rivers and bays that have been known to exhibit bores include those listed below.

===Asia===
* Ganges–Brahmaputra, India and Bangladesh
* Indus River, India and Pakistan
* Sittaung River, Burma
* Qiantang River, China, which has the world&#x27;s largest bore, up to high, traveling at up to 
* Batang Lupar or Lupar River, near Sri Aman, Malaysia. The tidal bore is locally known as &quot;benak&quot;.
* Batang Sadong or Sadong River, Sarawak, Malaysia.
* Bono, Kampar River, at Meranti Bay, Pelalawan, Indonesia. The phenomenon is feared by the locals to sink ships. It is reported to break up to inland, but usually up to with height.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
* Styx River, Queensland
* Daly River, Northern Territory

====New Zealand====
*Wairoa River, Northland Region

====Papua New Guinea====
* Fly River
* Turama River

===Europe===
====Ireland====
* River Shannon, up the Shannon Estuary to Limerick, Ireland: 21 September 2013

====United Kingdom====
* River Dee, Wales and England
* River Mersey. The second highest tidal bore after the Severn bore, up to high. The bore tends to form around the Manchester Ship Canal.
* The Severn bore on the River Severn, Wales and England, up to high
* The Trent Aegir on the River Trent, England, up to high. Also other tributaries of the Humber Estuary.
* River Parrett
* River Welland
* The Arnside Bore on the River Kent
* River Great Ouse
* River Ouse, Yorkshire. Like the Trent bore, this is also known as &quot;the Aegir&quot;.
* River Eden
* River Esk
* River Nene. This was also known as the Eagre.
* River Nith
* River Lune, Lancashire
* River Ribble, Lancashire
* River Yealm, Devon
* River Leven, Cumbria
====Belgium====
* Durme, Flanders

====France====
The phenomenon is generally named &quot;un mascaret&quot; in French. but some other local names are preferred.
* Seine had a significant bore until the 1960s, locally named &quot;la barre&quot;. Since then, it has been practically eliminated by dredging and river training.
* Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel including Couesnon, Sélune, and Sée
* Arguenon
* Vire
*Sienne
* Vilaine, locally named &quot;le mascarin&quot;
* Dordogne
* Garonne

===North America===

====United States====

* The Turnagain Arm of Cook Inlet, Alaska. Up to and .
* Historically, the Colorado River had a tidal bore up to 6 feet, that extended 47 miles up river.
* The Savannah River up to inland.
* Small tidal bores, only a few inches in height, have been observed advancing up tidal bayous on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
* The bay inlet of the Crissy Field Marsh, in San Francisco, California, can exhibit tidal bores near high tide.

====Canada====
With the Bay of Fundy having the highest tidal range in the world, most rivers draining into the upper bay between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have significant tidal bores. They include:
* The Petitcodiac River formerly had the highest bore in North America at over in height, but causeway construction between Moncton and Riverview in the 1960s led to subsequent extensive sedimentation which reduced the bore to little more than a ripple. After considerable political controversy, the causeway gates were opened on April 14, 2010, as part of the Petitcodiac River Restoration Project and the tidal bore began to grow again. The restoration of the bore has been sufficient that in July 2013, professional surfers rode a -high wave up the Petitcodiac River from Belliveau Village to Moncton to establish a new North American record for continuous surfing.
* The Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. When the tidal bore approaches, completely drained riverbeds are filled. It has caused the deaths of several tourists who were in the riverbeds when the bore came in. Tour boat operators offer rafting excursions in the summer.
* The bore is fastest and highest on some of the smaller rivers that connect to the bay including the River Hebert and Maccan River on the Cumberland Basin, the St. Croix and Kennetcook rivers in the Minas Basin, and the Salmon River in Truro.

====Mexico====
Historically, there was a tidal bore on the Gulf of California in Mexico at the mouth of the Colorado River. It formed in the estuary about Montague Island and propagated upstream. It was once very strong, but diversions of the river for irrigation have weakened the flow of the river to the point the tidal bore has nearly disappeared.

===South America===

====Brazil====
* Amazon River in Brazil, up to high, running at up to . It is known locally as the &quot;pororoca&quot;.
* Mearim River in Brazil
* Araguari River in Brazil. Very strong in the past, it is considered lost since 2015, due to buffaloes farming, irrigation, and dam construction along the river, leading to substantial loss of water flow.

====Venezuela====
* Orinoco River in Venezuela
====Chile====
* Southern Channels, ex. Canal de Castro, Chiloé Island (fjord of Castro) in Chile

==Lakes with tidal bores==
Lakes with an ocean inlet can also exhibit tidal bores.

===North America===
* Nitinat Lake on Vancouver Island has a sometimes dangerous tidal bore at Nitinat Narrows where the lake meets the Pacific Ocean. The lake is popular with windsurfers due to its consistent winds.

* Tidal race
* Tsunami
* Tonlé Sap, a lake and river system in Cambodia where monsoon flooding can cause the river to flow backwards temporarily albeit not as a tidal bore

<text>USS &quot;Portland&quot; (CL/CA–33) was the lead ship of the &quot;Portland&quot; class of cruiser and the first ship of the United States Navy named after the city of Portland, Maine. Launched in 1932, she completed a number of training and goodwill cruises in the interwar period before seeing extensive service during World War II, beginning with the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942, where she escorted the aircraft carrier and picked up survivors from the sunken carrier . She screened for &quot;Yorktown&quot; again in the Battle of Midway, picking up her survivors as well. She then supported the carrier during the initial phase of the Guadalcanal Campaign later that year, and was torpedoed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The torpedo inflicted heavy damage which put her out of action for six months as she was repaired in Sydney, Australia, and later San Diego, California.

Returning to combat in mid-1943, &quot;Portland&quot; saw action in many of the major engagements of the Pacific War, conducting shore bombardments in support of campaigns at the Aleutian Islands, Gilbert and Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and New Guinea. She was involved in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf, engaging Japanese ships in the decisive Battle of Surigao Strait. She then conducted shore bombardments at Lingayen Gulf and Corregidor Island, and in 1945 supported landings during the Battle of Okinawa until the end of the war.

Following World War II, &quot;Portland&quot; accepted the Japanese surrender in the Caroline Islands and then undertook several Operation Magic Carpet cruises to bring U.S. troops home. She was decommissioned in 1946 and scrapped by 1962. In her extensive service she accrued 16 battle stars, making her one of the most decorated ships in the U.S. fleet.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Portland&quot; was the lead ship of the third class of &quot;treaty cruisers&quot; to be constructed by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, following the two vessels of the ordered in 1926 and the six vessels of the ordered in 1927. Ordered for the U.S. Navy in Fiscal Year 1930. &quot;Portland&quot; was originally designated as a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, and given the hull classification symbol CL-33. She was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns, with the symbol CA-33 on 1 July 1931, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

&quot;Portland&quot; was designed for a standard displacement of , and a full-load displacement of . However, &quot;Portland&quot; only displaced when completed. In 1943, a light tripod was added forward of the second funnel on the ship, and a prominent fire-control director was installed aft.

Her four Parsons GT geared turbines each drove a propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Yarrow boilers. &quot;Portland&quot;″s power plant generated and she had a designed maximum speed of . The ship reached, however, on sea trials. She rolled badly until fitted with bilge keels. &quot;Portland&quot; was designed for a range of at .

The ship was armed with a main battery of nine Mark 9 8&quot;/55 caliber guns arrayed in three triple mounts, a superfiring pair forward and one aft. She was armed with eight 5&quot;/25 caliber guns for anti-aircraft defense, and she also had two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns. In 1945, her anti-aircraft defenses were upgraded, receiving 24 Bofors 40 mm guns which were arranged in four quad mounts and four twin mounts. &quot;Portland&quot; was also upgraded with seventeen Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.

She was originally designed with of armor for deck and side protection, but during construction her armor was increased. As completed, the ship was protected with of belt armor which increased to around the magazines. Her armor was between and thick on the transverse bulkheads, while armor on her main deck was thick. Armor on her barbettes was thick, armor on her gunhouses was thick, and armor on her conning tower was thick.

Additionally, &quot;Portland&quot;-class cruiser USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; CA-35 was designed with space to be outfitted as a fleet flagship, with accommodations for an Admiral and his staff to operate. The class also featured two aircraft catapult amidships, and she could carry four aircraft which were stored in a hangar. Her total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 848, a wartime complement of 952, and a complement 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.

&quot;Portland&quot; was laid down by Bethlehem Steel at its Quincy Shipyard on 17 February 1930. The machinery was provided by the builders. &quot;Portland&quot; was launched on 21 May 1932 and commissioned on 23 February 1933. She was the first ship named for the city of Portland, Maine, and sponsored by the daughter of Mayor Ralph D. Brooks of Portland, and with Captain Herbert F. Leary as her first commander. Her sailors would later nickname her &quot;Sweet Pea.&quot;

== Service history ==

Departing Boston on 1 April 1933, the cruiser arrived Gravesend Bay, New York late in the day on 3 April. The next evening, she was dispatched on her first assignment to the scene of the airship , which had crashed at sea. Thirty six minutes after receiving the message, she was underway and en route to the crash site. She was the first Navy vessel on scene, and began coordinating the search and rescue effort with other ships arriving. In spite of her efforts, 73 were killed in the crash, including Admiral William Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics.

&quot;Portland&quot; steamed from San Diego, California, on 2 October 1935 along with , which was carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president spent much of his trip fishing with his party. After visiting Panama and several other ports, the two ships steamed to Charleston, South Carolina, where the President disembarked. &quot;Portland&quot; spent the remainder of the interwar era with the Scouting Force, Cruiser Division 5 and later in the United States Pacific Fleet conducting peacetime training and a number of goodwill missions. She crossed the equator for the first time on 20 May 1936 during fleet maneuvers.

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Portland&quot; was two days away, en route to Midway Atoll as part of a carrier group escorting aircraft carrier . From December 1941 to 1 May 1942, she operated between the West Coast, Hawaii, and Fiji on patrol.

=== Battle of Coral Sea ===

&quot;Portland&quot; joined Task Force 17 (TF 17), commanded by Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher and centered around the carrier escorted by &quot;Portland&quot; as well as cruisers and plus the destroyers , , , , , and and oiler and &quot;Tippecanoe&quot;. TF 17 departed Tongatabu on 27 April &quot;en route&quot; to the Coral Sea. On the morning of 1 May, TF 17 joined with Task Force 11 (TF 11) about northwest of New Caledonia. TF 17 completed refueling the next day, but TF 11 reported that they would not be finished fueling until 4 May. Fletcher elected to take TF 17 northwest towards the Louisiades.

At 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was notified that a force of Japanese troops had been sighted at Tulagi the day before, approaching the southern Solomons. TF 17 changed course and proceeded at towards Guadalcanal to launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning. On 4 May, from a position south of Guadalcanal (), TF 17 launched airstrikes against Japanese forces off Tulagi. After recovering its aircraft late in the evening of 4 May, TF17 retired towards the south. The next morning, TF 17 rendezvoused with TF 11 and Task Force 44 (TF 44) at a predetermined point south of Guadalcanal (). Prompted by reports the Japanese would attack Port Moresby, the force moved to the Louisiades to engage the Japanese the next day. &quot;Portland&quot; was assigned to Task Group 17.2 under Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid together with cruisers , , &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Chester&quot;, and five destroyers from Destroyer Squadron One. She screened for &quot;Yorktown&quot; throughout the operation, including during Japanese air attacks on the two carriers on 8 May. Following the battle, she was to escort the damaged &quot;Lexington&quot;, but after fires on that carrier became uncontrollable she was abandoned and sunk. &quot;Portland&quot; took on 722 of her survivors. She suffered no casualties herself, though at least four of her sailors were transferred to the &quot;Neosho&quot; shortly before the battle and were lost when that ship was sunk.

=== Battle of Midway ===
After brief repairs at Tongatabu, &quot;Portland &quot; took on a new commander, Captain Laurance T. DuBose. She then steamed for Pearl Harbor escorting &quot;Yorktown&quot;, before heading to Midway Atoll to set a trap for Japanese forces attacking there. On 4 June, after Dive-Bombers from carriers &quot;Yorktown&quot; and had sunk three Japanese carriers, aircraft from Japanese carrier &quot;Hiryū&quot; responded with an attack on &quot;Yorktown&quot; that afternoon. &quot;Portland&quot; was to her port, providing anti-aircraft defense along with cruisers and . A Japanese air attack came at 14:00 and another after 16:30, and &quot;Yorktown&quot; was struck several times with torpedoes. With increasing damage, the carrier was abandoned and its survivors picked up by five destroyers and then transferred to &quot;Portland&quot;. In all, 2,046 of &quot;Yorktown&quot;&#x27;s crew transferred to the cruiser. She then steamed toward Pearl Harbor and met the submarine tender and transferred the &quot;Yorktown&quot; survivors aboard her on 6 June. During 7 June she searched for downed naval aviators and the next day joined the group of carrier . They steamed for the Aleutian Islands to counter a Japanese force there but were recalled to Pearl Harbor two days later.
=== Guadalcanal campaign ===
&quot;Portland&quot; accompanied the invasion fleet to Guadalcanal, escorting &quot;Enterprise&quot;. She remained off the coast protecting the landings at Tulagi and Guadalcanal from 7–9 August. In this duty, she missed the Battle of Savo Island and withdrew two days later following &quot;Enterprise&quot;. She then remained in the area to support the Guadalcanal operations and to protect communications lines for the attacking forces.
Remaining with &quot;Enterprise&quot;, she later participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. On 24 August she was posted to air defense to the port of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and though she and her sisters were able to down a number of Japanese aircraft, the carrier was hit at 18:34. She continued to protect the carrier through 25 August, when Allied forces prevented reinforcement of Japanese units in the Solomons by a large naval armada under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Following the battle she escorted &quot;Enterprise&quot; to Pearl Harbor and was then ordered on a secret mission to the Gilbert Islands to conduct a raid on Tarawa with light cruiser . She took aboard Rear Admiral Mahlon S. Tisdale and was designated Task Unit 16.9.1. Between 14:10 and 14:51 on 15 October she attacked Japanese ships near the island, damaging a transport and a destroyer and suffering one damaged aircraft before she withdrew and rejoined the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task group near the Solomons.

She then steamed south to take part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands as one of the escorts for &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The carrier came under heavy air attack at 10:12 on 24 October, and &quot;Portland&quot; suffered her first wartime damage as one of her guns exploded in firing and again when one of her AA guns depressed too low and damaged the splinter shield, injuring 19 men. In heavy fighting &quot;Enterprise&quot; was hit once but &quot;Portland&quot; and the task group shot down several aircraft. At 11:53 the bridge lost control of steering, and before it could regain control, a Japanese submarine was spotted. The submarine struck &quot;Portland&quot; with three torpedoes, but none detonated, likely because the submarine had fired too close and they had no time to arm.

Two weeks later, she participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 12–15 November, which resulted in heavy damage to both forces but broke up the determined Japanese effort to disrupt the landing of 6,000 American troops on Guadalcanal, to bombard Henderson Field, and to land 7,000 reinforcements of their own. At the outbreak of the battle, &quot;Portland&quot; was escorting a convoy traveling to Guadalcanal from New Caledonia as part of Task Force 67. After a four-day journey they arrived and began to offload supplies on 12 November and were countered by a Japanese air attack of 46 aircraft. That night, she was among a force of five cruisers and eight destroyers under Daniel J. Callaghan which steamed to counter an approaching Japanese force. They spotted a Japanese force of two battleships, one cruiser and eleven destroyers and immediately opened fire, sinking the . Shortly thereafter, &quot;Portland&quot; was struck by a torpedo fired by either the destroyer or the destroyer at 01:58, causing heavy damage to her stern. The torpedo struck the starboard side, which blew off both inboard propellers, jammed the rudder five degrees to starboard, and jammed her Number Three turret in train and elevation. A four degree list was quickly corrected by shifting ballast, but the steering problem could not be overcome and the ship was forced to steam in circles to starboard. The blast disrupted her steering column, forcing her to steer in a circle. At the end of her first circle, she fired on the battleship , with her forward turrets. The Japanese ship returned fire, but all salvos passed over the cruiser. In the four six-gun salvos returned by &quot;Portland&quot;, she succeeded in starting fires in the Japanese ship. At dawn, she was one of three U.S. ships still too damaged to withdraw on their own power. Then again at 06:30, still circling, &quot;Portland&quot; opened fire on the abandoned hulk of the destroyer at a range of . After the sixth salvo, &quot;Yūdachi&quot; exploded, rolled over, and sank within five minutes. She was eventually able to correct the steering problem and withdraw on her own power. She later received a Navy Unit Commendation for her actions in the battle. She suffered 18 killed, 17 wounded in the battle.

With the assistance of Higgins boats, a YP, and a tug, &quot;Portland&quot; anchored at Tulagi on 14 November. From there, she was towed to Sydney, Australia, by the tugboat and escorted by the destroyers and for preliminary repairs prior to in the United States. She arrived at Sydney 30 November but did not enter drydock until 24 December after &quot;Chester&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot; were repaired. During this time the crew was given extended shore leave. Two of the ship&#x27;s sailors died in accidents during this leave. She left Australia after preliminary repairs, escorted by destroyer . Following short stops at Samoa and Pearl Harbor, the ship arrived at Mare Island Navy Yard on 3 March 1943.

===1943–1944===

After operational training in southern Californian waters, &quot;Portland&quot; steamed for the Aleutians late in May, arriving on 11 June and bombarding Kiska on 26 July. After covering a reconnaissance landing on Little Kiska on 17 August, she called at Pearl Harbor on 23 September, there to San Francisco in early October, then back to Pearl Harbor in mid-October. From November 1943 to February 1944, &quot;Portland&quot; participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns. She bombarded Tarawa on 20 November supporting landings there for several days. She was lightly damaged by a friendly depth charge when a nearby destroyer erroneously detected a Japanese submarine. In December 1943 she moved to the Marshall Islands escorting the new &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier . While &quot;Lexington&quot; came under air attack, none of the Japanese planes came within range of &quot;Portland&quot; and she did not open fire. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 December, and went into drydock to repair her rudder and propellers.

After repairs, she joined Task Group 51 under Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill for an attack on Darrit, steaming for that island on 23 January and arriving 30 January. After shelling the island for 30 minutes, it was discovered no Japanese were ashore. She then moved to support operations on Eniwetok Atoll on 8 February, providing shore bombardment on Parry Island ahead of landings which took place on 19 February. She then screened carriers conducting airstrikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai between 30 March and 1 April. She then joined with a carrier force assigned to cover the landings around Hollandia and Tanahmerah on New Guinea, which took place from 21 to 24 April. She steamed northward with the carrier force and struck Truk with five other cruisers and destroyers. &quot;Portland&quot; then bombarded Satawan in the Nomei Group. Following this series of operations, &quot;Portland&quot; returned to Mare Island for a more extensive overhaul, which was completed in August. She returned to the western Pacific for shore bombardments of Peleliu from 12 to 14 September. The cruiser supported the landing on Peleliu on 15 September, providing artillery to support the advance of Allied forces. She provided gunfire support at Peleliu through 29 September, and then steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island in the Admiralties.

===Battle of Leyte Gulf ===

&quot;Portland&quot; next joined Cruiser Division 4 for the next major campaign against the Philippines. She arrived off Leyte on 17 October, entering the Gulf the next day, and began two days of shore bombardments to prepare for the troop landings there. On the night of 24 October, a strong Japanese force consisting of two battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers headed for Surigao Strait with the apparent intent of raiding shipping in Leyte Gulf. The Japanese force advanced in rough column up the narrow strait during darkness, but was met with a large U.S. force of cruisers, destroyers and battleships, including &quot;Portland&quot;. She and her sisters steamed across the top of the strait, crossing the T of the Japanese force. The Japanese were first met by PT boats, then in succession by three coordinated destroyer torpedo attacks, and finally by devastating gunfire from American battleships and cruisers disposed across the northern end of the strait. &quot;Portland&quot; took the under fire, scoring four hits on her at 04:02, striking the compass platform and AA defense center. She continued firing on the &quot;Mogami&quot; for ten minutes She continued to fire on the stranded &quot;Mogami&quot; until 05:30, striking several hits, including on the ship&#x27;s bridge, killing the captain and executive officer. The Battle of Surigao Strait was a decisive defeat for the Japanese force, with most of its ships being destroyed.

===1945===
From 3 January to 1 March 1945, &quot;Portland&quot; participated in the operations at Lingayen Gulf and Corregidor. Arriving off Lingayen Gulf on 5 January, and bombarding the vicinity of Cape Bolinao, she entered the Gulf the same day and commenced bombardment of the eastern shore but discontinued immediately when a large wave of Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes approached. &quot;Portland&quot; entered Manila Bay on 15 February, and bombarded the south shore of Corregidor in preparation for landings there. She returned to Leyte Gulf on 1 March for repairs and replenishment, having seen five months of continuous action.

From 26 March to 20 April, she joined Task Force 54 (TF 54), which conducted shore bombardments of Okinawa in support of the Allied landings during the Okinawa campaign. The Japanese air arm had been decimated by this point in the war, and the lack of trained and experienced pilots led to the most extensive deployment of the &quot;kamikaze&quot;; &quot;Portland&quot; endured 24 air raids, shot down four Japanese aircraft, and assisted in downing two others. From 8 May to 17 June, she supported ground forces on Okinawa providing artillery support for ground forces, departing on 17 June for maintenance at Leyte before returning to Buckner Bay on 6 August, where she remained conducting shore bombardments until the end of the war.

==Post-war==

With the termination of hostilities, &quot;Portland&quot; was designated flagship of Vice Admiral George D. Murray, Commander Mariana Islands, who was to accept the surrender of the Carolines. The ship steamed to Truk Atoll and there Murray, acting for Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, accepted the formal capitulation of the senior Japanese military and civilian officials in ceremonies aboard &quot;Portland&quot;. She was then selected for Operation Magic Carpet duty, and returned to Pearl Harbor from 21 to 24 September embarking 600 troops for transportation to the United States. She transited the Panama Canal on 8 October and arrived at Portland, Maine, for Navy Day celebrations on 27 October. She then conducted two trans-Atlantic crossings in November and December, bringing troops home from the European Theater. She reported on 11 March 1946 to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for inactivation and assignment to the Reserve Fleet. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 12 July 1946 and was maintained in the United States Reserve Fleet. While she was identified as one of the few ships that had fought through the entire war and had not missed any major battle, no attempt was made to save her as a museum ship at either Portland, Maine, or Portland, Oregon. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 March 1959 and sold to Union Minerals and Alloys Corp. in New York on 6 October. She was scrapped at Wainwright Shipyard in Panama City, Florida, during 1961 and 1962.

Her tripod mast was preserved at Fort Allen Park, Portland. She received 16 battle stars for World War II service, making her among the most decorated US ships of World War II.

<doc id="554919" wikidata="Q7316245" url="?curid=554919" title="Conservation and restoration of rail vehicles">
<text>Conservation and restoration of rail vehicles aims to preserve historic rail vehicles. It may concern trains that have been removed from service and later restored to their past condition, or have never been removed from service, like UP 844, the only U.S. steam locomotive to never be retired. They are often operated in present-day service as moving examples of living history, as opposed to static exhibits. 

The majority of restored trains are operated at heritage railways and railway museums, although they can also be found on the main lines or branch lines of the commercial working railway, operated by specialist railtour companies or museum groups. In contrast, main line railway preservation is the practice of operating restored trains on a railway network which is also operational primarily for serious commercial use.

For authenticity, the location/route of preserved trains is often chosen to match the original trains used. Heritage railways and railway museums aim to restore and operate restored trains. Trains are often restored to the original authentic livery of their original owner.
== In the United States ==

The restoration of historic railway equipment has gained importance in the United States, primarily because of a large amount of steam locomotives and cabooses donated by railroads to cities and museums, many of which have been displayed in parks for many years. Often these restoration projects are accomplished by a local railroad club or chapters of a national organization.

Examples of major projects accomplished by clubs are D&amp;RGW 315, which was displayed in the city park in Durango, Colorado, until removed by the Durango Railway Historical Society and restored to operation, as well as D&amp;RGW 223, which was displayed at Liberty Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, until moved to Ogden and restored by the Golden Spike Chapter of the Railway &amp; Locomotive Historical Society.

Eureka &amp; Palisades 4, also known as the &quot;Eureka&quot;, was purchased by a lawyer from Reno, Nevada. She was restored and is still privately owned, operating occasionally on the Durango &amp; Silverton and Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroads in Colorado.

<text>The Illinois Country ( ; ; ), also referred to as Upper Louisiana ( ; ), was a vast region of New France claimed in the 1600s that later fell under Spanish and British control before becoming what is now part of the Midwestern United States. While the area claimed included the entire Upper Mississippi River watershed, French colonial settlement was concentrated along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in what is now the U.S. states of Illinois and Missouri, with outposts on the Wabash River in Indiana. Explored in 1673 from Green Bay to the Arkansas River by the &quot;Canadien&quot; expedition of Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, the area was claimed by France. It was settled primarily from the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; in the context of the fur trade, and in the establishment of missions from Canada by French Catholic religious orders. Over time, the fur trade took some French to the far reaches of the Rocky Mountains, especially along the branches of the broad Missouri River valley. The &quot;Illinois&quot; in the territory&#x27;s name is a reference to the Illinois Confederation, a group of related Algonquian native peoples.

The Illinois Country was governed from the French province of Canada until 1717 when, by order of King Louis XV, it was annexed to the French province of Louisiana, becoming known as &quot;Upper Louisiana&quot;. By the mid-18th century, major settlements included Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Chartres, Saint Philippe, and Prairie du Rocher, all on the east side of the Mississippi in present-day Illinois; and Ste. Genevieve across the river in what is now Missouri, as well as Fort Vincennes in what is now Indiana.

As a consequence of the French defeat in the French and Indian War in 1764, the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi River was ceded to the British and became part of the British Province of Quebec; the land west of the river was ceded to Spanish Louisiana.

During the American Revolutionary War, Virginian George Rogers Clark led the Illinois campaign against the British. Illinois Country east of the Mississippi River along with what was then much of Ohio Country became part of Illinois County, Virginia, claimed by right of conquest. The county was abolished in 1782. In 1784, Virginia ceded its claims to the U.S. government and the area was incorporated as part of the Northwest Territory. The name lived on as Illinois Territory between 1809 and 1818, and as the State of Illinois after its admission to the union in 1818. The Spanish-occupied portion of Illinois Country west of the Mississippi was acquired by the United States from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

==Location and boundaries==

The boundaries of the Illinois Country were defined in a variety of ways, but the region now known as the American Bottom was nearly at the center of all descriptions. One of the earliest known geographic features designated as &quot;Ilinois&quot; was what later became known as Lake Michigan, on a map prepared in 1671 by French Jesuits. Early French missionaries and traders referred to the area southwest and southeast of the lake, including much of the upper Mississippi Valley, by this name. &quot;Illinois&quot; was also the name given to an area inhabited by the Illiniwek. A map of 1685 labels a large area southwest of the lake &quot;les Ilinois&quot;; in 1688, the Italian cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli labeled the region (in Italian) as &quot;Illinois country.&quot; In 1721, the seventh military district of Louisiana was named &quot;Illinois&quot;. It included more than half of the present state, as well as the land between the Arkansas River and the line of 43 degrees north latitude, between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River. A royal ordinance of 1722—following the transfer of the Illinois Country&#x27;s governance from Canada to Louisiana—may have featured the broadest definition of the region, making it coterminous with Upper Louisiana: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes and north of the mouth of the Ohio River, including both banks of the Mississippi as well as the lower Missouri Valley. In 1723, the area around the Wabash River became a separate district.

A generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northeastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to &quot;le Rocher&quot; on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present-day Rock Island, Illinois). Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were near the limit of Louisiana&#x27;s reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Checagou, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien operated as dependencies of Canada.

This boundary between Canada and the Illinois Country remained in effect until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, after which France surrendered its remaining territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. (Although British forces had occupied the &quot;Canadian&quot; posts in the Illinois and Wabash countries in 1761, they did not occupy Vincennes or the Mississippi River settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia until 1764, after the ratification of the peace treaty.) As part of a general report on conditions in the newly conquered lands, Gen. Thomas Gage, then commandant at Montreal, explained in 1762 that, although the boundary between Louisiana and Canada was not exact, it was understood that the upper Mississippi above the mouth of the Illinois was in Canadian trading territory.

Distinctions became somewhat clearer after the Treaty of Paris in 1763, when Britain acquired Canada and the land claimed by France east of the Mississippi and Spain acquired Louisiana west of the Mississippi. Many French settlers moved west across the river to escape British control. On the west bank, the Spanish also continued to refer to the western region governed from St. Louis as the &quot;District of Illinois&quot; and referred to St. Louis as the &quot;city of Illinois&quot;.

==Exploration and settlement==

The first French explorations of the Illinois Country were in the first half of the 17th century, led by explorers and missionaries based in Canada. Étienne Brûlé explored the upper Illinois country in 1615 but did not document his experiences. Joseph de La Roche Daillon reached an oil spring at the northeasternmost fringe of the Mississippi River basin during his 1627 missionary journey.

In 1669–70, Father Jacques Marquette, a missionary in French Canada, was at a mission station on Lake Superior, when he met native traders from the Illinois Confederation. He learned about the great river that ran through their country to the south and west. In 1673–74, with a commission from the Canadian government, Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River territory from Green Bay to the Arkansas River, including the Illinois River valley. In 1675, Marquette returned to found a Jesuit mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois. Over the next decades missions, trade posts, and forts were established in the region. By 1714, the principal European, non-native inhabitants were &quot;Canadien&quot; fur traders, missionaries and soldiers, dealing with Native Americans, particularly the group known as the Kaskaskia. The main French settlements were established at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Sainte Genevieve. By 1752, the population had risen to 2,573.

From the 1710s to the 1730s, the Fox Wars between the French, French allied tribes and the Meskwaki (Fox) Native American tribe occurred in what is now northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and Michigan, in particular, over the fur trade. During the conflict, in what is now McLean County, Illinois, French and allied forces won a consequential battle against the Meskwaki in 1730.

===Fort St. Louis du Rocher===

French explorers led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle built Fort St. Louis on a large butte by the Illinois River in the winter of 1682. Called &quot;Le Rocher&quot;, the butte provided an advantageous position for the fort above the river. A wooden palisade was the only form of defenses that La Salle used in securing the site. Inside the fort were a few wooden houses and native shelters. The French intended St. Louis to be the first of several forts to defend against English incursions and keep their settlements confined to the East Coast. Accompanying the French to the region were allied members of several native tribes from eastern areas, who integrated with the Kaskaskia: the Miami, Shawnee, and Mahican. The tribes established a new settlement at the base of the butte known as Hotel Plaza.
After La Salle&#x27;s five-year monopoly ended New France governor Joseph-Antoine de La Barre wished to put Fort Saint Louis along with Fort Frontenac under his jurisdiction. By orders of the governor, traders and his officer were escorted to Illinois. On August 11, 1683, LaSalle&#x27;s armorer, Pierre Prudhomme, obtained approximately one and three-quarters of a mile of the north portage shore.

During the earliest of the French and Indian Wars, the French used the fort as a refuge against attacks by Iroquois, who were allied with the British. The Iroquois forced the settlers, then commanded by Henri de Tonti, to abandon the fort in 1691. De Tonti reorganized the settlers at Fort Pimitoui in modern-day Peoria.

French troops commanded by Pierre-Charles de Liette occupied Fort St. Louis from 1714 to 1718; De Liette&#x27;s jurisdiction over the region ended when the territory was transferred from Canada to Louisiana. Fur trappers and traders used the fort periodically in the early 18th century until it became too dilapidated. No surface remains of the fort are found at the site today. The region was periodically occupied by a variety of native tribes who were forced westward by the expansion of European settlements. These included the Potawatomi, Ottawa, and Ojibwe.

On April 20, 1769, an Illinois Confederation warrior assassinated Chief Pontiac while he was on a diplomatic mission in Cahokia. According to local legend, the Ottawa, along with their allies the Potawatomi, attacked a band of Illini along the Illinois River. The tribe climbed to the butte to seek refuge from the attack. The Ottawa and Potawatomi continued the siege until the Illini tribe starved to death. After hearing the story, Europeans referred to the butte as Starved Rock.

===Fort de Chartres===
On January 1, 1718, a trade monopoly was granted to John Law&#x27;s Company. Hoping to make a fortune mining precious metals in the area, the company with a military contingent sent from New Orleans built a fort to protect its interests. Construction began on the first Fort de Chartres (in present-day Illinois) in 1718 and was completed in 1720.

The original fort was located on the east bank of the Mississippi River, downriver (south) from Cahokia and upriver of Kaskaskia. The nearby settlement of Prairie du Rocher, Illinois, was founded by French-Canadian colonists in 1722, a few miles inland from the fort.
The fort was to be the seat of government for the Illinois Country and help to control the aggressive Fox Indians. The fort was named after Louis, duc de Chartres, son of the regent of France. Because of frequent flooding, another fort was built further inland in 1725. By 1731, the Company of the Indies had gone defunct and turned Louisiana and its government back to the king. The garrison at the fort was removed to Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1747, about 18 miles to the south. A new stone fort was planned near the old fort and was described as &quot;nearly complete&quot; in 1754, although construction continued until 1760.

The new stone fort was headquarters for the French Illinois Country for less than 20 years, as it was turned over to the British in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris at the end of the French and Indian War. The British Crown declared almost all the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River from Florida to Newfoundland a Native American territory called the Indian Reserve following the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The government ordered settlers to leave or get a special license to remain. This and the desire to live in a Catholic territory caused many of the &quot;Canadiens&quot; to cross the Mississippi to live in St. Louis or Ste. Genevieve. The British soon relaxed their policy and later extended the Province of Quebec to the region.

The British took control of Fort de Chartres on October 10, 1765 and renamed it Fort Cavendish. The British softened the initial expulsion order and offered the Canadien inhabitants the same rights and privileges enjoyed under French rule. In September 1768, the British established a Court of Justice, the first court of common law in the Mississippi Valley (the French law system is called civil law).

After severe flooding in 1772, the British saw little value in maintaining the fort and abandoned it. They moved the military garrison to the fort at Kaskaskia and renamed it Fort Gage. Chartres&#x27; ruined but intact magazine is considered the oldest surviving European structure in Illinois and was reconstructed in the 20th century, with much of the rest of the Fort.

===Agricultural settlement and slavery===
According to historian Carl J. Ekberg, the French settlement pattern in Illinois Country was generally unique in 17th- and 18th-century French North America. These were unlike other such French settlements, which primarily had been organized in separated homesteads along a river with long rectangular plots stretching back from the river (ribbon plots). The Illinois Country French, although they marked long-ribbon plots, did not reside on them. Instead, settlers resided together in farming villages, more like the farming villages of northern France, and practiced communal agriculture.

After the port of New Orleans, along the Mississippi River to the south, was founded in 1718, more African slaves were imported to the Illinois Country for use as agricultural and mining laborers. By the mid-eighteenth century, slaves accounted for as much as a third of the population.

===Other settlements===
*In 1675, Jacques Marquette founded the mission of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin at the Grand Village of the Illinois, near present-day Utica, Illinois, which was destroyed by Iroquois in 1680.

*Peoria was at first the southernmost part of New France, then the northernmost part of the French Colony of Louisiana, and finally the westernmost part of the newly formed United States. Fort Crevecoeur was first founded in 1680. Another fort, often called Fort Pimiteoui, and later Old Fort Peoria, was established in 1691. French interests dominated at Peoria for well over a hundred years, from the time the first French explorers came up the Illinois River in 1673 until the first United States settlers began to move into the area around 1815. A small French presence persisted for a time on the east bank of the river, but was gone by about 1846. Today, only faint echoes of French Peoria survive in the street plan of downtown Peoria, and in the name of an occasional street, school, or hotel meeting room: &quot;Joliet&quot;, &quot;Marquette&quot;, &quot;LaSalle&quot;.
*The Mission of the Guardian Angel was established near the Chicago portage between 1696 and 1700.

*Cahokia, established in 1696 by French missionaries from Quebec, was one of the earliest permanent settlements in the region. It became one of the most populous of the northern towns. In 1787, it was made the seat of St. Clair County in the Northwest Territory. In 1801, William Henry Harrison, then governor of Indiana Territory, enlarged St. Clair County to administer a vast area extending to the Canada–US border. By 1814, the county had been reduced to almost the size of present-day St. Clair County, Illinois. The county seat was shifted from Cahokia to Belleville. On April 20, 1769, the great Indian leader Chief Pontiac was murdered in Cahokia by a chief of the Peoria.
*Kaskaskia, established in 1703, was at first small mission station for the French. It flourished to become capital of the Illinois Territory, 1809–1818, and the first capital of the state of Illinois, 1818−1820. The French built a fort here in 1721, which was destroyed in 1763 by the British. (The fort was situated above what was then the lower course of the Kaskaskia River, but became the new channel of the Mississippi in 1881.) During the American Revolutionary War, General George Rogers Clark took possession of the village in 1778. The residents rang the church bell in celebration, and it became known as the &quot;liberty bell&quot;. (It had been sent in 1741 by King Louis XV.) Flooding and a lateral shift of the river channel in 1881 cut off the old settlement from the mainland of Illinois and destroyed some of the village and its archaeology. Much of the village cemetery was transferred to the higher ground of Fort Kaskaskia State Park across the river. Today visitors can reach the remnants of Kaskaskia only by a bridge and road from the Missouri side. In the Great Flood of 1993, the Mississippi submerged all but a few rooftops and the steeple of the Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception, built in 1843 and moved brick by brick to the new location on Kaskaskia Island about 1893.
*In 1720, Philip Francois Renault, the Director of Mining Operations for the Company of the West, arrived with about 200 laborers and mechanics and 500 African slaves from Saint-Domingue to work the mines. However, the mines yielded only unprofitable coal and lead, providing insufficient revenues for the Company of the West to survive. In 1723, Renault, with his workers and slaves, established the village of St. Philippe (on the Bottoms down from the present-day unincorporated community of Renault, Illinois in Monroe County, Illinois.) It was about 3 miles north of Fort de Chartres. This is the first record of African slaves in the region. Some of the French farmers also used slaves for labor, but most families held only a few, if any. The village quickly produced an agricultural surplus, with its goods sold to lower Louisiana, as well as to settlements less successful than those in the Illinois Country, such as Arkansas Post.
*As early as 1733, a trading post was established by Jean Baptiste de Girardot at Cape Girardeau and the town later formed in 1793.
*The original Ste. Genevieve was established around 1750 along the western banks of the Mississippi River. The village consisted of mostly farmers and merchants of French-Canadian descent from the settlements on the east side. Despite flooding, the town remained in that location until the great flood of 1785 destroyed much property. The villagers decided to move the entire village to higher ground about two miles north and half a mile back from the river floodplain. The city has retained the most buildings of French Colonial architecture in the US.
*The French established Fort Orleans in 1723 along the Missouri River near Brunswick, Missouri.
*Fort Vincennes, on the Wabash River, later known as &quot;St. Vincennes&quot; and eventually Vincennes, Indiana, was established in 1732. The British renamed it Fort Sackville after their capture of it in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years&#x27; War.) George Rogers Clark renamed it Fort Patrick Henry, for the Governor of Virginia, when he took it in the American Revolution. Although part of the original expansive Illinois Country, as part of the Northwest Territory, it became the seat of a separate county.
*The French built Fort de L&#x27;Ascension (later, de Massiac) on the Ohio River in 1757 near present-day Metropolis, Illinois.
*St. Louis was founded in 1764 by French fur traders. In 1765, it was made the capital of Upper Louisiana; and after 1767, control of the region west of the Mississippi was given to the Spanish (&quot;District of Illinois&quot;). In 1780, St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native Americans, during the American Revolutionary War.

==British province of Quebec==
Following the British occupation of the east bank of the Mississippi in 1765, some Canadien settlers remained in the area, while others crossed the river, forming new settlements such as St. Louis. The British faced an uprising of Native Americans known as Pontiac&#x27;s War. Longtime allies of the French, the Kaskaskia and Peoria tribes had resisted the British, and Pontiac led a coalition of the Illini, and Kickapoo, Miami, Ojibway, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Seneca, Wea, and Wyandot against the British. Pursuant to the Treaty of Paris (1763) Captain Thomas Sterling and the 42nd Regiment of Foot took command of Fort de Chartres, from the French commandant, Captain Louis St. Ange de Bellerive in 1765.

==Illinois Country under American control==

During the Revolutionary War, General George Rogers Clark took possession of the part of the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi for Virginia. In November 1778, the Virginia legislature created the county of Illinois, comprising all of the lands lying west of the Ohio River to which Virginia had any claim, with Kaskaskia as the county seat. Captain John Todd was named as governor. However, this government was limited to the former Canadien settlements and was rather ineffective.

For their assistance to General Clark in the war, settled Canadien and Indian residents of Illinois Country were given full citizenship. Under the Northwest Ordinance and many subsequent treaties and acts of Congress, the Canadien and Indian residents of Vincennes and Kaskaskia were granted specific exemptions, as they had declared themselves citizens of Virginia. The term &quot;Illinois Country&quot; was sometimes used in legislation to refer to these settlements.

Much of the Illinois Country region became an organized territory of the United States with the establishment of the Northwest Territory in 1787. In 1803, the old Illinois Country area west of the Mississippi was gained by the U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase.

<text>Petty officer second class (PO2) is a rank found in some navies and maritime organizations.

==Canada==

Petty officer, 2nd class, (PO 2), is a Naval non-commissioned member rank of the Canadian Forces. It is senior to the rank of master sailor (formerly master seaman) and its equivalents, and junior to petty officer 1st-class and its equivalents. Its Army and Air Force equivalent is sergeant (Sgt); together, Sgts and PO 2s make up the cadre of senior non-commissioned officers.

The rank insignia of the PO 2 is three gold chevrons, point down, surmounted by a gold maple leaf. A PO 2 is generally initially addressed as “Petty Officer &lt;name&gt;” or &quot;PO &lt;name&gt;&quot;, and thereafter as &quot;PO&quot;, although in correspondence the full rank or abbreviation is used before the member&#x27;s name. The full appellation Petty Officer 2nd Class or PO 2 in speech is generally used only when the second-class distinction must be made, such as to distinguish between members with similar names but differing ranks, or on promotion parades. The corresponding NATO rank is OR-6—however, a PO 2 with less than 3 years seniority are considered OR-5

PO 2s generally mess and billet with chief petty officers and other petty officers, and their army and air-force equivalents, warrant officers and sergeant. Their mess on naval bases or installations is generally named the &quot;Chiefs and POs Mess&quot;.

==United States==

Petty officer second class is the fifth enlisted rank in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, just above petty officer third class and below petty officer first class, and is a non-commissioned officer. It is equivalent to the rank of sergeant in the Army and Marine Corps, and staff sergeant in the Air Force. It is the most commonly held rank in the United States Navy, with around 25% of active-duty Navy enlisted personnel and 20% of all active duty Navy personnel (including commissioned officers) holding that rank.

===Overview===
Similar to petty officer third class, advancement to petty officer second class is dependent on time in service, performance evaluations by superiors, and rate (technical specialty) examinations. The advancement cycle is currently every 6 months. Only a certain number of billets (job openings for this rate) open up biannually and all third-class petty officers compete. The top scorers are chosen for advancement, but only in sufficient quantities to fill the billets available.

===Job description===
Petty Officers serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors below them, there is no such thing as an &quot;undesignated Petty Officer.&quot; Every Petty Officer has both a rate (rank) and rating (job, similar to an MOS in other branches). A Petty Officer&#x27;s full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a Petty Officer Second Class, who has the rating of interior communications electrician would properly be called an Interior Communications Electrician, Second Class. The term Petty Officer is, then, only used in abstract, the general sense, when referring to a group of Petty Officers of different ratings, or when the Petty Officer&#x27;s rating is unknown. Often, the Petty Officer is just referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus EM2 Reyes would just be called EM2. A Petty Officer Second Class may be generically referred to as PO2 when the sailor&#x27;s rating is not known, although some prefer to be called simply &quot;Petty Officer (Martinez).&quot; To address a Petty Officer, one would say, &quot;Petty Officer Meyer&quot;, &quot;Meyer&quot;, or &quot;Sailor&quot; (the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rate than the Petty Officer unless in a familiar setting, such as by those who work closely with the Petty Officer). It is uncommon to address a petty officer as simply &quot;Petty Officer&quot;, the way one might address an NCO in the Marine Corps as &quot;Sergeant&quot;. Also acceptable, but archaic, would be to address a Petty Officer or Chief Petty Officer of any grade as &quot;Mister Meyer&quot; or &quot;Ms. Meyer&quot;. The use of &quot;Ms.&quot; or &quot;Mister&quot; is commonly only in reference to junior commissioned officers or warrant officers.

===Short form naming===
Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as GM for gunner&#x27;s mate, BU for builder, or BM for boatswain&#x27;s mate. When combined with the petty officer level, this gives the shorthand for the petty officer&#x27;s rate, such as IT2 for &quot;information systems technician second class&quot;. It is common practice to refer to the petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Unlike most rates, the Aircrew survival equipmentman rate uses their former title of parachute rigger for abbreviation and are still referred as PRs and parachute riggers in the military community after undergoing a rating name change in 1986.

===Promotion system===
The Navy uses promotion points that they call &quot;final multiple score&quot; system, which considers the whole person by calculating a candidate&#x27;s performance, experience, and knowledge into the individual&#x27;s final multiple score. To advance a candidate must meet the time in rate eligibility, pass the advancement test, and have a final multiple higher than the minimum required to advance.

Among enlisted sailors, 12 consecutive years of good conduct (categorized as no court-martial convictions and no non-judicial punishments) entitles the sailor to wear a good conduct variation of their rate insignia: the chevrons which are normally red are replaced with gold. The perched eagle remains silver. However, the high year tenure initiative mandates that a petty officer second class may only have 16 years of service. If a PO2 fails to make petty officer first class within that time, the petty officer is involuntarily separated for not meeting advancement requirements. However, this may be waived in the event the sailor holds a critical rate, Navy Enlisted Classification or security clearance.

===Uniform===
All U.S. Coast Guard petty officers wear red chevrons and red service stripes, until the rate of chief petty officer, where both chevrons and service stripes are gold.

In the US Navy, all petty officers wear red stripes and chevrons until they reach 12 consecutive years of service with good conduct (as determined by eligibility for the Navy Good Conduct Medal as its criteria).

<doc id="554929" wikidata="Q7321497" url="?curid=554929" title="Rhosnesni High School">
<text>Rhosnesni High School, also known as Ysgol Rhosnesni High School or simply Ysgol Rhosnesni, is an English-medium mixed comprehensive secondary school in Rhosnesni, Wrexham, Wales. It was created in 2003 and maintained by Wrexham County Borough Council as a part of their controversial &quot;super schools&quot; plan.

== History ==

In 2002, plans were ratified by the Welsh Assembly to create two &#x27;super&#x27; schools in Wrexham, with an emphasis on vocational education. Opposition to the plans was received from parents, and a petition of over 1000 signatures was delivered to the Wrexham County Council in April 2002. Nearby Yale College, which was to offset the some costs of the project by buying the Groves school and selling land, dropped out.

By late 2003 it became apparent that the original £12 million budget for upgrades would fall short by about £10 million because inflation was not accounted for in estimates. Nonetheless, the county council approved overspends allowing the schools to be upgraded as planned. Both of the new schools serve around 2500 pupils age 11 through to 16.

Three secondary schools were merged into two schools: Rhosnesni (formerly known as St. David&#x27;s School), and Ysgol Clywedog (formerly known as Bryn Offa). The third school, Groves, was used as a temporary site for Rhosnesni, Ysgol Clywedog and another local school, St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic High School, while improvements were made to their permanent sites. The Groves was shut down entirely in 2006 and remained unused until its partial demolition in 2013/&#x27;14. As of 2022, the oldest part of the Groves school building still stands, and proposals for demolishing the site faced local opposition.

In 2014, a report by Wrexham Council showed that there had been a big fall in admissions to Wrexham&#x27;s super schools. The percentage of primary school pupils applying to Rhosnesni had fallen from 71% to 36%. Rhosnesni was one of 40 Welsh schools that was chosen to take part in a Welsh government scheme to improve standards.

In 2022, after Estyn’s inspection of the school in June 2022 they decided that the school made insufficient progress from their last core inspection in 2018. This led to Rhosnesni High entering special measures.

In 2023, after Estyn’s follow-up inspection of the school in March 2023 they decided that the school made sufficient progress from their last core inspection in 2022. This led to Rhosnesni High being removed out of special measures.

<text>Esther Eggertsen Peterson (December 9, 1906 – December 20, 1997) was an American consumer and women&#x27;s advocate.

==Background==
The daughter of Danish immigrants, Esther Eggertsen grew up in a family who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Provo, Utah. She graduated from Brigham Young University in 1927 with a degree in physical education, and a master&#x27;s from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1930. She held several teaching positions in the 1930s, including one at the innovative Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which brought milliners, telephone operators and garment workers onto the campus.

She moved to New York City where she married Oliver Peterson. In 1932, the two moved to Boston, where she taught at The Winsor School and volunteered at the YWCA.

==Career==
In 1938, Peterson became a paid organizer for the American Federation of Teachers and traveled around New England. In 1944, Peterson became the first lobbyist for the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C. In 1948, the State Department offered Peterson&#x27;s husband a position as a diplomat in Sweden. The family returned to Washington, D.C., in 1957 and Peterson joined the Industrial Union Department of the AFL–CIO, becoming its first woman lobbyist.

She was Assistant Secretary of Labor and Director of the United States Women&#x27;s Bureau under fellow Bostonian President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson named Peterson to the newly created post of Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs. She would later serve as President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs.

Peterson was also Vice President for Consumer Affairs at Giant Food Corporation, where she led an initiative to introduce the first nutrition labels in 1971, and was president of the National Consumers League.

She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981. Peterson was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board in 1982. In 1990, the American Council on Consumer Interests created the Esther Peterson Consumer Policy Forum lectureship, which is presented annually at the council&#x27;s conference. She was named a delegate of the United Nations as a UNESCO representative in 1993. In that same year, Peterson was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Peterson died on December 20, 1997.

<text>America Coming Together (ACT) (founded in 2003) was a progressive, political action 527 group dedicated to get-out-the-vote activities. ACT did not specifically endorse any political party but worked almost exclusively on behalf of Democratic candidates. It was the largest 527 (tax-exempt) group in 2004 and was planning to be involved in future races. The group was primarily funded by insurance mogul Peter Lewis, currency trader George Soros, and labor unions, especially the Service Employees International Union, and was led by Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the AFL–CIO.

== History ==
Starting in mid-2004, the album &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; was recorded by more than 90 musical acts under the direction of Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, for the purpose of getting more young adults to register and vote.

In the last three weeks before the 2004 presidential and congressional elections, ACT planned on funding over 12 million phone calls to targeted voters and having canvassers hand-deliver 11 million pieces of literature at targeted doorsteps. On Election Day, ACT had projected to have 45,000 paid canvassers in the battleground states and spent over $10 million on Election Day. It had 86 offices open every day, with a staff of 4,000 and a goal of reinforcing the army of 45,000 paid canvassers with 25,000 volunteers.

In the fall of 2004, ACT was featured in the Frontline Documentary &quot;The Persuaders&quot;, which described ACT&#x27;s use of narrowcasting.

In 2005 ACT was in the process of being wound down. Its website was not renewed and is no longer operational. 

The Federal Election Commission announced on August 29, 2007, that it had reached a settlement agreement with ACT for violations of various federal campaign finance laws during the 2004 US presidential campaign. ACT agreed to pay $775,000 in fines.

<doc id="554950" wikidata="Q427499" url="?curid=554950" title="Postmaterialism">
<text>In sociology, postmaterialism is the transformation of individual values from materialist, physical, and economic to new individual values of autonomy and self-expression.

The term was popularized by the political scientist Ronald Inglehart in his 1977 book &quot;The Silent Revolution&quot;, in which he discovered that the formative affluence experienced by the post-war generations was leading some of them to take their material security for granted and instead place greater importance on non-material goals such as self-expression, autonomy, freedom of speech, gender equality and environmentalism. Inglehart argued that with increasing prosperity, such postmaterial values would gradually increase in the publics of advanced industrial societies through the process of intergenerational replacement.
==History==
The sociological theory of postmaterialism was developed in the 1970s by Ronald Inglehart. After extensive survey research, Inglehart postulated that the Western societies under the scope of his survey were undergoing transformation of individual values, switching from materialist values, emphasizing economic and physical security, to a new set of postmaterialist values, which instead emphasized autonomy and self-expression. Inglehart argued that rising prosperity was gradually liberating the publics of advanced industrial societies from the stress of basic acquisitive or materialistic needs.

Observing that the younger people were much more likely to embrace postmaterialist values, Inglehart speculated that this silent revolution was not merely a case of a life-cycle change, with people becoming more materialist as they aged, but a genuine example of generational replacement causing intergenerational value change.

The theory of intergenerational change is based on the &quot;scarcity hypothesis&quot; and the &quot;socialization hypothesis&quot;.

===Scarcity hypothesis===
Inglehart assumed that individuals pursue various goals in something akin to a hierarchical order. While people may universally aspire to freedom and autonomy, the most pressing material needs like hunger, thirst and physical security have to be satisfied first, since they are immediately linked with survival. According to Inglehart&#x27;s interpretation of Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of human goals, while scarcity prevails, these &quot;materialistic&quot; goals will have priority over postmaterialist goals like belonging, esteem, and aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. However, once the satisfaction of the survival needs can be taken for granted, the focus will gradually shift to these &quot;non-material&quot; goods.

===Socialization hypothesis===
The relationship between material conditions and value priorities is not one of immediate adjustment. A large body of evidence indicates that people&#x27;s basic values are largely fixed when they reach adulthood, and change relatively little thereafter. Therefore, cohorts which often experienced economic scarcity would &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; (all things being equal) place a high value on meeting economic needs (such as valuing economic growth above protecting the environment) and on safety needs (will support more authoritarian styles of leadership, will exhibit strong feelings of national pride, will be strongly in favour of maintaining a large, strong army and will be more willing to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of law and order). On the other hand, cohorts who have experienced sustained high material affluence start to give high priority to values such as individual improvement, personal freedom, citizen input in government decisions, the ideal of a society based on humanism, and maintaining a clean and healthy environment.

Together, these two hypotheses carry the implication that, given long periods of material affluence, a growing part of society will embrace postmaterialist value systems, an implication which has been indeed borne out internationally in the past 30 years of survey data. The postmaterial orientations acquired by each cohort during socialization have been observed to remain remarkably steady over the time-frame of multiple decades, being a more stable value-system in contrast to the more volatile political and social attitudes.

===Measuring postmaterialism===
There are several ways of empirically measuring the spread of postmaterialism in a society. A common and relatively simple way is by creating an index from survey respondents&#x27; patterns of responses to a series of items which were designed to measure personal political priorities.

The theoretical assumptions and the empirical research connected with the concept of postmaterialism have received considerable attention and critical discussion in the human sciences. Amongst others, the validity, the stability, and the causation of postmaterialism has been doubted.

The so-called &quot;Inglehart-index&quot; has been included in several surveys (e.g., General Social Survey, World Values Survey, Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, Turning Points of the Life-Course). The time series in ALLBUS (German General Social Survey) is particularly comprehensive. From 1980 to 1990 the share of &quot;pure post-materialists&quot; increased from 13% to 31% in West Germany. After the economic and social stress caused by German reunification in 1990 it dropped to 23% in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards. The ALLBUS sample from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of postmaterialists (1991: 15%, 1992: 10%, 1998: 12%). International data from the 2000 World Values Survey show the highest percentage of postmaterialists in Australia (35%) followed by Austria (30%), Canada (29%), Italy (28%), Argentina (25%), United States (25%), Sweden (22%), Netherlands (22%), and Puerto Rico (22%).

As increasing postmaterialism is based on the abundance of material possessions or resources, it should not be mixed indiscriminately with asceticism or general denial of consumption. In some way postmaterialism may be described as super-materialism. German data show that there is a tendency towards this orientation among young people, in the economically rather secure public service, and in the managerial middle class.

Recently, the issue of a &quot;second generation of postmaterialism&quot; appearing on the scene of worldwide civil society, to a large extent conceived as their &quot;positive ideological embodiment&quot;, has been brought up by cultural scientist Roland Benedikter in his seven-volume book series &quot;Postmaterialismus&quot; (2001–2005).

<doc id="554953" wikidata="Q5020803" url="?curid=554953" title="2000 California Proposition 22">
<text>Proposition 22 was a law enacted by California voters in March 2000 stating that marriage was between one man and one woman. The Act was proposed by means of the initiative process and was authored by state Senator William &quot;Pete&quot; Knight, and is known informally as the Knight initiative. Voters adopted the measure on March 7, 2000, with 61% in favor to 39% against. The margin of victory surprised many, since a Field Poll immediately prior to the election estimated support at 53%, with 40% against and 7% undecided.

The Act added Section 308.5 of the Family Code, which read &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California&quot;. Because the Act was an ordinary statute, it could be struck down if it were inconsistent with the state constitution, as happened on May 15, 2008, when the state supreme court, ruling in &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;, declared that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry. This 4–3 decision invalidated Proposition 22 and some related California laws.

Proposition 22 provoked debate long after its passage. In November 2008, California voters overturned the &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot; decision by approving an amendment of the state constitution called Proposition 8. In June 2010, Proposition 8 was declared unconstitutional by U.S. district judge Vaughn Walker based on the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In June 2013, the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; ruled that the Intervenor-Defendants had no Article III standing to appeal Walker&#x27;s ruling, keeping Proposition 8 unenforceable throughout California and enabling same-sex marriage to resume just two days after the decision.

==Statutory framework==
Prior to 1977, marriage was defined in Section 4100 of the California Civil Code. This stated that marriage is &quot;a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which consent of the parties making that contract is necessary&quot;. While related sections of the law made references to sex, a State Assembly committee that was debating adding sex-specific terms to this section in 1977 noted: &quot;Under existing law it is not clear whether partners of the same sex can get married&quot;. That year, the legislature amended the legal definition of marriage to remove any ambiguity. In 1992 the legal definition of marriage was moved from the Civil Code to Section 300 of the Family Code.

When Proposition 22 came before voters, marriage was defined in the Family Code as &quot;a personal relation arising out of a civil contract &quot;between a man and a woman,&quot; to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary&quot; [&quot;italics&quot; added]. Even though the definition governing who may marry explicitly precluded contracting a same-sex marriage in California, a separate provision, Section 308, governed recognition of marriages contracted elsewhere. This stated that a &quot;marriage contracted outside this state that would be valid by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was contracted is valid in this state&quot;. Advocates of Proposition 22 described Section 308 as a &quot;loophole&quot;, apparently forcing California to recognize a same-sex marriage validly contracted in some other state.

To address this, Proposition 22 did not reword the existing provisions of the Family Code, but added to them the declaration that &quot;only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California&quot;. The official citation of Proposition 22, the &quot;California Defense of Marriage Act&quot;, is almost the same as that of a federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1996. This federal law had a similar purpose, and was intended to prevent any state from being obligated to recognize a same-sex marriage contracted in another state.

== Results of vote==

==Disputes over its effect==
Central to many subsequent disputes over Prop 22&#x27;s effect is a distinction between statutes enacted by the legislature and initiative statutes enacted directly by the electorate. The legislature is free to amend or rescind its own enactments, but voters must approve any attempt by the legislature to amend or repeal an initiative statute unless the initiative itself states otherwise.

===Controversy over domestic partnerships===

In 1999, California enacted the first in a series of domestic partnership provisions. California courts have entertained several challenges to legislative expansions of the domestic partnership scheme enacted after Prop 22. Generally, these challenges alleged that the legislature inappropriately amended Prop 22 by making California&#x27;s domestic partnership scheme too similar to marriage, or more broadly, that Prop 22 made &#x27;any&#x27; subsequent recognition of same-sex partnerships beyond the legislature&#x27;s inherent power. California Courts of Appeal rejected those claims, noting that domestic partnerships already existed as a legal institution separate from marriage at the time Prop 22 was enacted.

===Controversy over marriage licensing within California===

In September 2005, the California legislature passed a bill, A.B. 849, eliminating the gender requirements for marriage now found in Family Code section 300. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill. In his veto message, Schwarzenegger argued that passing a law that would implicitly repeal Section 308.5 required the assent of the electorate (and separately made note of pending court challenges). In ruling on the disputes between Prop 22 and the domestic partnership enactments, California Courts of Appeal have reached differing conclusions as to Prop 22&#x27;s scope within the marriage statutes. 

In &quot;Armijo v. Miles,&quot; the Second Appellate District Distinguished Prop 22 from the case at bar by noting, in part, that the initiative prevented the recognition of same-sex marriages conducted &quot;outside&quot; California:

The legislative analysis and the ballot arguments readily demonstrate that Proposition 22 was crafted with a prophylactic purpose in mind. It was designed to prevent same-sex couples who could marry validly in other countries or who in the future could marry validly in other states from coming to California and claiming, in reliance on Family Code section 308, that their marriages must be recognized as valid marriages. With the passage of Proposition 22, then, only opposite-sex marriages validly contracted outside this state will be recognized as valid in California.

The &quot;Armijo&quot; court may not have ruled that the historical purpose of Prop 22 limited its scope to out of state marriages. The court appears to have ultimately presumed that Proposition 22 did indeed apply to in-state arrangements deemed to be &quot;marriages,&quot; but held that the challenged wrongful death statute did not violate that prohibition:

The question remaining is whether the portion of AB 2580 that amends the wrongful death statute subverts Proposition 22. Defendants&#x27; position that it does is based on the faulty premise that the right to sue for wrongful death is an exclusive benefit of marriage. It is not.

Less than a week later, on April 4, 2005, the Third Appellate District ruled more explicitly, in &quot;Knight v. Superior Court,&quot; that Prop 22 also included within the initiative&#x27;s ambit marriages licensed &quot;within&quot; the state:

The plain language of Proposition 22 and its initiative statute, section 308.5, reaffirms the definition of marriage in section 300, by stating that only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid and recognized in California. This limitation ensures that California will not legitimize or recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions, as it otherwise would be required to do pursuant to section 308, and that California will not permit same-sex partners to validly marry within the state.

As with &quot;Armijo,&quot; the &quot;Knight&quot; court upheld the challenged statute on the grounds that it did not constitute a &quot;marriage&quot; for purposes of Prop 22 or Section 300. The cases differed, however, in that &quot;Armijo&quot; appeared to rely on a narrow observation that a particular benefit was not exclusive to marriage, while &quot;Knight&quot; upheld a broad domestic partnership statute against challenges it left almost no substantive difference between the two institutions. Parties in subsequent cases, including the same-sex marriage cases, have noted the apparent split between the appellate courts with respect to its scope.

As the ultimate rulings in these cases arguably did not require a finding that Prop 22 applies to in-state marriages (both were upheld against a challenge that they constituted marriage under Prop 22, the same result that would have obtained if they had ruled Prop 22 did not apply to in-state marriages), some argue that these findings are dicta. On the flip side, an argument can be made that these holdings are &quot;not&quot; dicta, as both courts ruled on the merits of whether or not a challenged in-state arrangement constituted a &quot;marriage&quot; for purposes of Prop 22, an allegation that would be moot if either court believed Prop 22 permitted in-state marriages. In 2008, the California Supreme Court resolved the controversy in ruling on the constitutionality of statutes limiting marriage to a man and a woman: &quot;this provision reasonably must be interpreted to apply both to marriages performed in California and those performed in other jurisdictions.&quot;

==Invalidation==

Separately, numerous challenges to the constitutionality of the opposite-sex requirements found in California&#x27;s marriage statutes, including Prop 22, came before the courts. A San Francisco trial court threw out all of the gender requirements on state constitutional grounds. On appeal, an intermediate court reversed that decision. In December 2006, the California Supreme Court voted unanimously to review all six cases and held oral argument on March 4, 2008, consolidating the cases as &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;. The Court ruled on May 15, 2008, that Proposition 22 violated the state Constitution and was therefore invalid. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger immediately issued a statement pledging to uphold the ruling, and repeated his pledge to oppose Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment initiative that would override the Court&#x27;s ruling and again ban same sex marriages by placing the text of Proposition 22 in the State Constitution. Proposition 22 has been officially repealed, effective January 1, 2015. Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 1306 on July 7, 2014.

<text>Finnish Sign Language () is the sign language most commonly used in Finland. There are 3,000 &quot;(2012 estimate)&quot; Finnish deaf who have Finnish Sign Language as a first language. As the Finnish system records users by their written language, not their spoken alone, nearly all deaf people who sign are assigned this way and may be subsumed into the overall Finnish language figures. Historically the aim was oralism, whereby deaf people were taught to speak oral Finnish, even if they could not hear it; thus older people are recorded under these figures. In 2014, only 500 people registered Finnish Sign Language as their first language. There are several sign languages that come under this label; FSL for those that can see; Signed Finnish, which does not follow the same grammatical rules, and a version for those who are blind and deaf. Thus, there are around 8,000 people that use a Finnish Sign Language linguistically. Many estimates say 5,000, but these are exaggerations derived from the 14,000 deaf people in Finland (many of whom do not speak Finnish Sign Language). Finnish Sign Language is derived from Swedish Sign Language, which is a different language from Finnish Swedish Sign Language (which is Swedish Finnish language derived from Finnish Sign Language, of which there are an estimated 90 speakers in Finland), from which it began to separate as an independent language in the middle of the 19th century.

Finnish legislation recognized Finnish Sign Language as one of Finland&#x27;s domestic languages in 1995 when it was included in the renewed constitution. Finland then became the third country in the world to recognize a sign language as a natural language and the right to use it as a mother tongue.

Courses in &quot;sign language&quot; have been taught in Finland since the 1960s. At that time, instruction taught signs but followed Finnish word order (see Manually Coded Language). Later, as research on sign languages in general and Finnish Sign Language in particular determined that sign languages tend to have a very different grammar from oral languages, the teaching of Finnish Sign Language and Signed Finnish diverged.

== History ==
Finnish Sign Language can be traced back to the mid-1800s when Carl Oscar Malm, a Finnish deaf individual who had studied in Sweden, founded Finland&#x27;s first school for the deaf in Porvoo in 1846. The Swedish sign language used by Malm spread among Finnish deaf individuals, evolving into its own language. The first association for the deaf in Finland was established in Turku in 1886. Albert Tallroth was involved in founding five different deaf associations and also the Finnish Association of the Deaf. By the late 1800s, oralism, or the speech method, began to be favored in the education of the deaf in Finland. This led to the prohibition of sign language in schools, even under threat of punishment. And as a result of oralism, Finnish Sign Language and Finnish-Swedish Sign Language began to diverge. Despite the ban, students in deaf schools continued to use sign language secretly in dormitories. The use of sign language persisted within the deaf community, while spoken language learned in school was used when interacting with hearing individuals.

Society started to have a more positive attitude towards the deaf and sign language after the 1970s. Sign language became a tool for rehabilitation and education, and it began to be taught in courses for parents of deaf children. In 1979, interpreter services became part of disability legislation, and in 1995, sign language gained constitutional status. In 1991, the possibility of sign language education was written into the Basic Education Act. The current Basic Education Act, as well as the latest curriculum framework for basic education in the 2014 Basic Education Curriculum, specify that &quot;if necessary, education should be provided in sign language for the hearing impaired.&quot; Education in sign language is mandatory for deaf individuals who have learned sign language as their first language.

== Education ==
Sign language can be studied as a major at the University of Jyväskylä, which also offers sign language teacher training. Additionally, it has been possible to complete basic studies in sign language and communication at the University of Turku.

One can study to become a sign language instructor at Pohjois-Savo Folk High School in Kuopio, at Rovala-Opisto in Rovaniemi, and at Turku Christian Institute.

Finnish Sign Language can be studied at the Finnish Association of the Deaf Folk High School, adult education centers, and summer universities.

<doc id="554960" wikidata="Q5240658" url="?curid=554960" title="David Viscott">
<text>David Steven Viscott (May 24, 1938 – October 10, 1996) was an American psychiatrist, author, businessman, and media personality. He was a graduate of Dartmouth (1959), Tufts Medical School and taught at University Hospital in Boston. He started a private practice in psychiatry in 1968 and later moved to Los Angeles in 1979 where he was a professor of psychiatry at UCLA. He founded and managed the Viscott Center for Natural Therapy in Beverly Hills, Newport Beach and Pasadena, California.

==Biography==
In 1980 Viscott began presenting his own full-time show on talk radio, and was notably one of the first psychiatrists to do so (talk station KABC). He screened telephone calls and gave considerable amount of free psychological counselling to his on-air &quot;patients.&quot;

In 1987 Viscott briefly had his own live syndicated TV show, &quot;Getting in Touch with Dr. David Viscott&quot;, providing much the same service as his radio show. In fact, the shows ran concurrently. In the early 1990s he had a weekly call-in therapy television program on KNBC in Los Angeles early Sunday morning after Saturday Night Live, titled &quot;Night Talk with Dr. David Viscott&quot;.

Viscott&#x27;s signature style was to attempt to isolate an individual&#x27;s source of emotional problems in a very short amount of time. Many of his books were of a self-help nature, written to assist the individual with his own examination of life. His autobiography, &quot;The Making of a Psychiatrist&quot;, was a best-seller, a Book of the Month Club Main Selection, and nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

Along with psychiatric advice, he would fall back on his medical knowledge to regularly devote entire segments of radio to answering medical questions. During these segments he would give medical advice. Many of the questions answered had to do with pharmacological advice. This was unique in the world of talk radio.

Viscott&#x27;s popularity peaked in the early 1990s, and then fell sharply. A separation from his wife, followed by declining health, occurred at about the same time that he left the air waves. He died in 1996 of heart failure complicated by a diabetic condition. At the time, he was living alone in Los Angeles. He is survived by three of his four children: Elizabeth, Penelope, and Jonathan.

==&quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
In the television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the character Dr. Marvin Monroe&#x27;s voice was based on Viscott. Monroe has been retired since the seventh season because voicing the character strained Harry Shearer&#x27;s throat. The character&#x27;s retirement was marked by the broadcast of a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital over Lou&#x27;s walkie-talkie in &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)&quot;. Since then, several references to Monroe being dead have been made: a glimpse of his gravestone in &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;, a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Gymnasium seen in &quot;Bye Bye Nerdie&quot;, and a trivia interstitial in the &quot;138th Episode Spectacular&quot; regarding which popular characters had recently died. However, Monroe is seen alive in the fifteenth season in &quot;Diatribe of a Mad Housewife&quot; purchasing a copy of Marge&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Harpooned Heart&quot;, stating simply that he had &quot;...been very sick&quot; when asked about his long absence by Marge. He was later seen as a ghost, claiming that he was &quot;stuck in limbo&quot; in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXV&quot;.

<doc id="554962" wikidata="Q2642390" url="?curid=554962" title="Mountbatten family">
<text>The Mountbatten family is a British family that originated as a branch of the German princely Battenberg family. The name was adopted by members of the Battenberg family residing in the United Kingdom on 14 July 1917, three days before the British royal family changed its name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. This was due to rising anti-German sentiment among the British public during World War I. The name is a direct Anglicisation of the German name , which refers to a small town in Hesse. The Battenberg family was a morganatic line of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, itself a cadet branch of the House of Hesse.

The family includes the Marquesses of Milford Haven (and formerly the Marquesses of Carisbrooke), as well as the Earls Mountbatten of Burma. The late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Queen Elizabeth II, adopted the surname of Mountbatten from his mother&#x27;s family in 1947, although he was a member of the House of Glücksburg by patrilineal descent. Another prominent member of the family was Lady Louise Mountbatten, who became Queen consort of Sweden after her husband ascended the Swedish throne as King Gustaf VI Adolf in 1950.

==Origins==
The Mountbatten family is a branch of the German house of Battenberg. The latter family was a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, which formerly ruled the Grand Duchy of Hesse in what is now Germany. The first member of the Battenberg family was Julia Hauke, whose brother-in-law (Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse) created her Countess of Battenberg with the style of &quot;Illustrious Highness&quot; (HIllH) in 1851, on the occasion of her morganatic marriage to Grand Duke Louis&#x27; brother, Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine. In 1858, Julia was elevated in title to Princess of Battenberg, with the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot; (HSH).

Two of Alexander and Julia&#x27;s sons, Prince Henry of Battenberg and Prince Louis of Battenberg, became associated with the British royal family. Prince Henry married The Princess Beatrice, youngest daughter of Queen Victoria. Prince Louis married Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, and became First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy.

Due to anti-German feelings prevalent in Britain during World War I, Prince Louis, his children and his nephews (the living sons of Prince Henry) renounced their German titles and changed their name to the more English-sounding Mountbatten. (They rejected an alternative translation, &quot;Battenhill&quot;.) Their cousin George V compensated the princes with British peerages. Prince Louis became the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Prince Alexander, Prince Henry&#x27;s eldest son, became the 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke.

==Members==

===Marquesses of Milford Haven===

The marquessate of Milford Haven was created in 1917 for Prince Louis of Battenberg, the former First Sea Lord, and a relation to the British royal family. He was at the same time made Earl of Medina and Viscount Alderney, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Princess Alice of Battenberg never took the name Mountbatten as she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903; her son, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, took the name upon becoming a naturalised British citizen.

Marquess of Carisbrooke was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1917 for Prince Alexander of Battenberg, eldest son of Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom and Prince Henry of Battenberg. He was made Viscount Launceston, in the County of Cornwall, and Earl of Berkhampsted at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

===Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh===

Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the son of Princess Alice of Battenberg and grandson of the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, took the name Mountbatten when he became a naturalised British subject. Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten married Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George VI of the United Kingdom, on 20 November 1947. In 1952, on the accession of his wife as Queen Elizabeth II, there was some dispute regarding the dynasty to which descendants of Elizabeth and Phillip would belong. Queen Mary (the new Queen&#x27;s grandmother) expressed to Prime Minister Winston Churchill her aversion to the idea of the House of Mountbatten succeeding the House of Windsor as the royal dynasty, and so it remained Windsor.

====Mountbatten-Windsor====

Mountbatten-Windsor is the personal surname of some of the descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh under an Order in Council issued in 1960, which has not been applied consistently. While the order specifically applies the surname &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; to Elizabeth&#x27;s male-line descendants not holding royal styles and titles, &quot;Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; has been formally used by some of her descendants who &quot;do&quot; hold royal styles. The surname was first officially used by Princess Anne in 1973, in the wedding register for her marriage to Mark Phillips. Prince William and his wife Catherine used the names &quot;Monsieur et Madame Mountbatten-Windsor&quot; when filing a French lawsuit against the French magazine &quot;Closer&quot;. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan named their children Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor from birth, although the children formally became a prince and princess on the accession of their grandfather to the throne on 8 September 2022.

Mountbatten-Windsor differs from the official name of the British royal family or royal house, which remains Windsor. The adoption of the Mountbatten-Windsor surname applies only to members of the royal family who are descended from Elizabeth, and not, for example, to her cousins, or descendants of her sister, Princess Margaret.

==Legacy==
The city of Ottawa, Ontario, erected &quot;Mountbatten Avenue&quot; in memory of the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. A Royal Canadian Sea Cadets corps, RCSCC No. 134 Admiral Mountbatten, was named after him in 1946. A bronze statue by Franta Belsky of Lord Mountbatten of Burma was erected in 1983 outside the Foreign Office, overlooking Horse Guards Parade. The earl is dressed in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet.

The Mountbatten Institute (formerly known as the Mountbatten Internship Programme), an organization based in New York and London dedicated to fostering work experience and cultural exchange by placing international graduate students abroad to earn postgraduate and degrees was set up by his eldest daughter, Patricia, 2nd Countess Mountbatten. It was named in honour of the countess&#x27;s father, the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma.

Despite the family&#x27;s well-known connections with the Royal Navy, the Mount Batten Peninsula, overlooking the Royal Naval Base of Devonport, England, is not named after them but after Sir William Batten, a 17th-century Surveyor of the Navy.
