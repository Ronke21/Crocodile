<text>Alien abduction (also called abduction phenomenon, alien abduction syndrome, or UFO abduction, Unidentified Flying Object capture) refers to the phenomenon of people reporting what they believe to be the real experience of being kidnapped by extraterrestrial beings and subjected to physical and psychological experimentation. People claiming to have been abducted are usually called &quot;abductees&quot; or &quot;experiencers&quot;. Most scientists and mental health professionals explain these experiences by factors such as suggestibility (e.g. false memory syndrome), sleep paralysis, deception, and psychopathology. Skeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between some of the aliens described by abductees and those depicted in science fiction films, in particular &quot;Invaders From Mars&quot; (1953).

Typical claims involve forced medical examinations that emphasize the subject&#x27;s reproductive systems. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuses and the dangers of nuclear weapons, or to have engaged in interspecies breeding. The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee. Unidentified flying objects (UFOs), alien abduction, and mind control plots can also be part of radical political apocalyptic and millenarian narratives.

Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made all around the world, but are most common in English-speaking countries, especially the United States. The first alleged alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961. UFO abduction claims have declined since their initial surge in the mid-1970s, and alien abduction narratives have found less popularity in mainstream media. Skeptic Michael Shermer proposed that the ubiquity of camera phones increases the burden of evidence for such claims and may be a cause for their decline.

== Overview ==
Mainstream scientists reject claims that the phenomenon literally occurs as reported. According to John E. Mack, a psychiatrist who gave credence to such claims, most of those who report alien abductions and believe their experiences were real are sane, common people, and psychopathology was associated only with some cases. Mack reported that some abduction reports are quite detailed, and an entire subculture has developed around the subject, with support groups and a detailed mythos explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens (Greys, Reptilians, &quot;Nordics&quot; and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either extraterrestrial or governmental interest in cover-up.

== History ==

=== Paleo-abductions ===
While the term &quot;alien abduction&quot; did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, modern speculation about some older stories interpreted them as possible cases. UFO researcher Jerome Clark dubbed them &quot;paleo-abductions&quot;.
* In the November 27, 1896, edition of the Stockton, California, &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by three tall, slender humanoids whose bodies were covered with a fine, downy hair who tried to kidnap the pair.
* In the October 1953 issue of &quot;Man to Man Magazine&quot;, an article by Leroy Thorpe titled &quot;Are the Flying Saucers Kidnapping Humans?&quot; asks the question &quot;Are an unlucky few of us, and perhaps not so few at that, being captured with the same ease as we would net butterflies, perhaps for zoological specimens, perhaps for vivisection or some other horrible death designed to reveal to our interplanetary invaders what makes us tick?&quot; 
* Rogerson writes that the 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Flying Saucers Uncensored&quot; declared that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed they were contacted by aliens, had disappeared under mysterious circumstances; Wilkins reported speculation that the duo were the victims of &quot;alleged abduction by flying saucers&quot;.

=== Two landmark cases ===
An early alien abduction claim occurred in the mid-1950s with the Brazilian Antônio Vilas-Boas case, which did not receive much attention until several years later. Widespread publicity was generated by the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961, culminating in a made-for-television film broadcast in 1975 (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.

Though these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson notes that these cases established a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that &quot;the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the &#x27;entirely unpredisposed&#x27; official history would have us believe.&quot; (The phrase &quot;entirely predisposed&quot; appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Bullard&#x27;s study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)

=== Later developments ===
R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon&#x27;s actuality and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually, Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989. Budd Hopkins had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s, he became interested in abduction reports and began using hypnosis to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.

The 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a plausible experience. Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Thomas E. Bullard&#x27;s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees.

With Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of ufology. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.

Furthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human–alien hybrids, the most advanced stage of which in the &quot;human hybridization program&quot; are known as hubrids, though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancy related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders.

The descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher&#x27;s emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized – though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better. The involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a sea change in the abduction studies.

According to &quot;Boston Globe&quot; writer Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, &quot;Abduction and contact stories aren’t quite the fodder for daytime talk show and New York Times bestsellers they were a few decades ago...Today, credulous stories of alien visitation rarely crack the mainstream media, however much they thrive on niche TV channels and Internet forums.&quot; Skeptic Michael Shermer noted that &quot;the camera-phone age is increasing the burden of evidence on experiencers&quot;.

==== John E. Mack ====
Harvard psychiatry professor John E. Mack believed in the credibility of alien abduction claims. Niall Boyce writing in &quot;The Lancet&quot; called him &quot;a well-meaning man uncritically elaborating on tales of alien abduction, and potentially both cementing and constructing false memories&quot;. Boyce observed that Mack&#x27;s work in hypnotic regression of claimants helped spread the Grey aliens meme into the culture.

Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T. E. Lawrence. Mack became interested in claims of alien abduction in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people and eventually writing two books on the subject. Due to Mack&#x27;s belief and subsequent promotion of the claims of those he interviewed, his professional reputation suffered, prompting Harvard to review his position in 1994. He retained tenure, but &quot;was not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore”.

== Abductees ==
The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population allege to have been abducted.

=== Demographics ===
Although abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often, these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.

=== Mental health ===
As a category, some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that &quot;as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence&quot;. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to &quot;mildly paranoid thinking&quot;, nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that &quot;none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.&quot;

=== Political conspiracy theories ===
Political scientist Michael Barkun, without taking a position on if UFOs and aliens are real, highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed &quot;improvisional millenarism&quot;. UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives, where alleged orthodoxy is claimed to be maintained in error for nefarious purposes and to keep society in ignorance. UFO and alien-related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards.

According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like &quot;The X-Files&quot; and its motion picture not only included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters but also featured demonization of FEMA, a common target of conspiracy theorists and millenarian scenarios. One conspiracy theory alleges that FEMA plans to incarcerate &quot;patriots&quot; suddenly in concentration camps during a disaster. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss &quot;consensus reality&quot; in favor of deviant alternative realities.

Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering it important to warn the world of such imminent danger.

== Abduction narrative ==
Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS&#x27;s definition of &quot;abductee&quot;, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or &quot;recovered&quot; through means like hypnosis.

Although different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical &quot;close encounter of the fourth kind&quot; (a popular but unofficial designation building on J. Allen Hynek&#x27;s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.

Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:

# Capture. The abductee is somehow rendered incapable of resisting, and taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien spacecraft.
# Examination and Procedures. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training &amp; testing, or sexual liaisons.
# Conference. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose, typically telepathically but sometimes using the abductee&#x27;s native language.
# Tour. The abductees are given a tour of their captors&#x27; vessel, though this is disputed by some researchers who consider this definition a confabulation of intent when just apparently being taken around to multiple places inside the ship.
# Loss of Time. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience, either as a result of fear, medical intervention, or both.
# Return. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.
# Theophany. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a &quot;high&quot; similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a &quot;mystical experience&quot;, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors. Whether this is the result of a metaphysical change, Stockholm syndrome, or prior medical tampering is often not scrutinized by the abductees at the time.
# Aftermath. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.

When describing the &quot;abduction scenario&quot;, David M. Jacobs says:
The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.
=== Capture ===
Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something &quot;familiar yet unknown&quot; will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet. This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent.

Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent &quot;shift&quot; into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness &quot;the Oz Factor&quot;. External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of &quot;limited self-willed mobility&quot;. As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report; sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors&#x27; UFO), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures.

As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light, with or without the abductors accompanying them, into the awaiting craft.

=== Examination ===
The examination phase of the so-called &quot;abduction narrative&quot; is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently alien beings against or irrespective of the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved and is sometimes described as appearing to be of a different species.

Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. This could result from a difference in the purpose of the examination – routine diagnosis or treatment or both versus scientific examination of an unfamiliar species –, or it could be due to a different level of technology that renders certain kinds of manual procedures unnecessary. The abductors&#x27; areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and to a lesser degree, the joints. Systems given less attention than a human doctor would – or omitted entirely – include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the &quot;examination&quot;. Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives, although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids. Injections also seem to be rare and IVs are almost completely absent. Miller says he has never heard an abductee claim to have a tongue depressor used on them.

=== Subsequent procedures ===
After the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.

&quot;Imaging&quot; procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. &quot;Envisioning&quot; is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer&#x27;s mind. &quot;Staging&quot; procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element. It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor.

&quot;Testing&quot; marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature. During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it. The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it. However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.

==== Child presentation ====
Abductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a &quot;child presentation&quot;. As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a &quot;child&quot;. Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same species as the abductors. Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of &quot;both&quot; species. These children are labeled by experiencers as hybrids between humans and their abductors, usually Greys.

Unlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports. Bullard says that the child presentation &quot;seems to be an innovation in the story&quot; and that &quot;no clear antecedents&quot; to descriptions of the child presentation phase exist before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.

=== Less common elements ===
Bullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims. He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:

# The conference
# The tour
# The journey
# Theophany

Chronologically within abduction reports, these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.

After allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed. They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination. The entities then hold a conference with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon. Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference &quot;phase&quot; of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies.

Tours of the abductors&#x27; craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative. The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination. Sometimes the abductees report traveling on a &quot;journey&quot; to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets. Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.

=== Return ===
Eventually, the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken. Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced &quot;missing time&quot; upon checking a timepiece.

Sometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives. UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about &quot;the cosmic application of Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; in response to this observation. Hopkins has estimated that these &quot;errors&quot; accompany 4–5 percent of abduction reports. One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially. This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house locked from the inside. Another common error is putting the abductee&#x27;s clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.

=== Realization event ===
Physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon. He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the &quot;realization event&quot;. The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode. Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the &quot;clinical horizon&quot; of the abduction experience.

== Trauma and recovery ==
Most people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies and some ascribe psychological trauma to their experiences. &quot;Post-abduction syndrome&quot; is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations. People who have a false memory which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder. People who believe they have been abducted by aliens usually have previous New Age beliefs, a vivid fantasy life, and suffer from sleep paralysis, according to a 2003 study by Harvard University.

=== Support groups ===
Support groups for people who believed they were abducted began appearing in the mid-1980s. These groups appear throughout the United States, Canada and Australia.

== Hypnosis ==
Many alien abductees recall much of their alleged abduction(s) through hypnosis. Due to the extensive use of hypnosis, and other methods which they view as being manipulative, skeptics explain the abduction narratives as false memories and suggestions.

=== Criticism ===
Alleged abductees seek out hypnotherapists to try to resolve issues such as missing time or unexplained physical symptoms such as muscle pain or headaches. This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients&#x27; lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information-gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction &quot;memories&quot;. Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories:
# A person is predisposed to accept the idea that certain puzzling or inexplicable experiences might be telltale signs of UFO abduction.
# The person seeks out a therapist, whom he or she views as an authority and who is, at the very least, receptive to this explanation and has some prior familiarity with UFO abduction reports.
# Alternatively, the therapist frames the puzzling experiences in terms of an abduction narrative.
# Alternative explanations of the experiences are not explored.
# There is increasing commitment to the abduction explanation and increasing anxiety reduction associated with ambiguity reduction.
# The therapist legitimates or ratifies the abductee&#x27;s experience, which constitutes additional positive reinforcement.
# The client adopts the role of the &quot;victim&quot; or abductee, which becomes integrated into the psychotherapy and the client&#x27;s view of self.

=== Supportive arguments ===
Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack counters this argument, noting &quot;It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word &quot;hypnosis&quot; at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer&#x27;s need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion.&quot;

== Perspectives ==
There have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between. Some have elected not to attempt explanations, noting instead similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.

Others are intrigued by the entire phenomenon but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. Psychiatrist John E. Mack concluded: &quot;The furthest you can go at this point is to say &quot;there&#x27;s an authentic mystery here.&quot; And that is, I think, as far as anyone &quot;ought&quot; to go&quot; (emphasis as in original). Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to &quot;take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences&quot;, up to and including &quot;missing time&quot;, directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children.

Putting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively &quot;real&quot;, literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction &quot;are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness&quot;. After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading ghost stories or watching horror movies, Matheson notes that people &quot;can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors&quot;. Matheson writes that when compared to the earlier contactee reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their &quot;relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public&quot;.

Some writers, have said abduction experiences bear similarities to pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations, noting as many as a dozen similarities. One notable example is the Orthodox monk Fr. Seraphim Rose, who devotes a whole chapter in his book &quot;Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future&quot; to the phenomena of UFOs and abductions, which, he concludes, are manifestations of the demonic.

As some studies suggest that in some UFO/alien encounters, these phenomena could be related to dissociative REM sleep states, like lucid dreams, sleep paralysis, and out-of-body experiences. In a 2021 study, published in &quot;International Journal of Dream Research&quot;, researchers focused on the hypothesis that if some of alien abduction stories are the products of REM sleep, then they could be deliberately emulated by lucid dreaming practitioners. To check the hypothesis, they instructed a group of volunteers to try to emulate alien encounters via lucid dreams. Of the volunteers, 114 (75%) were able to experience alien encounters. Regarding the successful cases, 20% were close to reality in terms of the absence of paradoxical dreamlike events. And only among this 20% sleep paralysis and fear were observed, which are common in &#x27;real&#x27; stories. In theory, random people might spontaneously encounter the same situation during REM sleep and confuse the events with reality.

== Testimonials ==
Abduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse reported to him 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a praying mantis-like entity two days after a V-shaped UFO sighting. This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the insectoid-type entity reported in some abduction accounts. He related this report to fellow researcher Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year.

While some corroborated accounts seem to support the literal reality of the abduction experience, others seem to support a psychological explanation for the phenomenon&#x27;s origins. Jenny Randles and Keith Basterfield both noted at the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference that of the five cases they knew of where an abduction researcher was present at the onset of an abduction experience, the experiencer &quot;didn&#x27;t physically go anywhere&quot;.

Brazilian researcher Gilda Moura reported on a similar case, the Sueli case, from her home country. When psychologist and UFO researcher Don Donderi said that these cases were &quot;evidence of psychological processes&quot; that did not &quot;have anything to do with a physical alien abduction&quot;, Moura replied: &quot;If the Sueli case is not an abduction, I don&#x27;t know what is an abduction any more&quot;. Gilda Moura noted that in the Brazilian Sueli case during the abduction UFOs were observed. Later, she claims the experiencer had eye burns, saw lights and there seemed to be residual poltergeist activity.

=== Attempts at confirmation ===
It has been argued that if actual &quot;flesh and blood&quot; aliens are abducting humans, there should be some hard evidence that this is occurring. Proponents of the physical reality of the abduction experience have suggested ways that could conceivably confirm abduction reports. One procedure reported occurring during the alleged examination phase of the experience is the insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman&#x27;s navel. Some have speculated that this could be a form of laparoscopy. If this is true, after the abduction there should be free gas in the woman&#x27;s abdomen, which could be seen on an X-ray image. The presence of free gas would be extremely abnormal and would help substantiate the claim of some sort of procedure being done to her.

<doc id="558882" wikidata="Q2420364" url="?curid=558882" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)">
<text>or Sonic the Hedgehog the Movie, is a 1996 Japanese two-part original video animation (OVA) based on the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video games by Sega. Produced by Pierrot and directed by Kazutaka Ikegami, the first episode was released in Japan on January 26, 1996, with the second following suit on March 22, 1996. 

The series was later licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films, whom released it as a single direct-to-video film on September 7, 1999, to coincide with the international release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. It features Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Dr. Eggman (Dr. Robotnik in the English release), Metal Sonic, and numerous supporting characters created exclusively for the OVA.

== Setting ==
Unlike other &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; media, the setting of the series is in the world of Planet Freedom, which is split into two distinct realms: the Land of the Sky and the Land of Darkness.

The Land of the Sky consists of an unknown number of continents that drift high in the stratosphere of the planet, all of them connected to a massive ice formation which also serves to anchor them to the planet&#x27;s surface below. According to Knuckles, if this ice network was destroyed, Planet Freedom&#x27;s rotation would hurl the Land of the Sky into outer space, killing everyone on it.

The Land of Darkness is the actual surface of Planet Freedom, a post-apocalyptic wilderness with the dastardly Ivo Robotnik as its sole living inhabitant. The Land of Darkness can only be accessed in one of two ways: by a whirlwind-like &quot;portal&quot; in the Land of the Sky, or via a warp zone, an extradimensional link between two points on Planet Freedom. Most of its terrain is untamed and mountainous, but the city ruins called Ancient Relics are the location of Robotnik&#x27;s empire. The city and terrain strongly imply that Planet Freedom is a post-apocalyptic Earth that was built upon with floating islands, with certain landmarks suggesting that the ruins are those of New York City.

== Plot ==
=== Part 1 ===
Sonic the Hedgehog is relaxing on the beach of South Island with Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, when Old Man Owl arrives with a message from the President asking Sonic to come to his office. Once there, they discover Dr. Ivo Robotnik has taken the President and his daughter Sara prisoner. After giving exposition of how Planet Freedom works (explaining the two &quot;dimensions&quot; of the planet, The Land of the Sky, and The Land of Darkness), Robotnik explains that a giant mecha named Metal Robotnik (&quot;Black Eggman&quot; in the original Japanese release) has exiled him from his utopian city of Robotropolis (&quot;Eggmanland&quot; in the original) and sabotaged the Robot Generator, which will explode by sunrise the next day. He asks Sonic to head to the Land of Darkness to stop it in exchange for the President and Sara&#x27;s lives. Once there, Metal Robotnik tries to stop them from reaching the generator. Knuckles the Echidna arrives and rescues them, and all three team up to destroy the mecha. Unbeknownst to them, Metal Robotnik is revealed to have been controlled by Robotnik, with Sara unwillingly in tow. The episode ends with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles heading to Robotropolis.

=== Part 2 ===
After entering Robotropolis, Knuckles distracts the enemy robots while Sonic and Tails try to stop the generator in the heart of the city. They arrive just in time, but when Sonic pulls the lever, the machine traps him and scans his body. Knuckles frees Sonic just as the machine crumbles to the ground, revealing Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s newest robot, Hyper Metal Sonic. Dr. Robotnik appears in Metal Robotnik&#x27;s remains and reveals he lured Sonic to copy his mind, personality, and abilities for Hyper Metal Sonic. Sonic and Metal battle, but Metal easily overpowers Sonic. Tails and Knuckles return to the Land of the Sky, where Tails learns that Metal is out to destroy the planet by digging into the ice caps that hold the Land of the Sky together, allowing lava to emerge and melt the ice. Sonic wakes up in Green Lake City and returns to the Presidential Palace, learning of Metal&#x27;s goal from the President.

Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles go to the ice caps, where Sara is being held hostage by Robotnik, planning to marry her so the two will rule over Planet Freedom after the Land of the Sky&#x27;s decimation. Sonic encounters Metal and the two have a lengthy battle. Tails manage to corrupt Metal&#x27;s data, and Sonic severely damages him. During the altercation, the President and Old Man arrive and are trapped in their aircraft, but Metal saves them. Sonic realizes that Metal does have emotions, as he was programmed with Sonic&#x27;s persona and instincts. Metal gets blown into a crack and falls into a subglacial volcano. Sonic reaches out his hand to help him, but Metal rejects it, telling him &quot;there is only one Sonic&quot; before being destroyed by the rising magma. Robotnik states he still has Sonic&#x27;s DNA and can re-build Metal Sonic, but one of his missiles from the fight inadvertently blows up the disc containing Sonic&#x27;s DNA. Knuckles then punches Sonic as revenge for Sonic accidentally stepping on him during the brawl, and the two get into a chase, with all the others following behind, ending the episode.

== Voice cast ==
== Production and release ==
The OVA series was produced by Studio Pierrot, Sega Enterprises and General Entertainment under the supervision of Sonic Team, Yuji Naka and Naoto Ohshima. It is directed and storyboarded by Kazutaka Ikegami, with Mayori Sekijima handling the story structure, Masashi Kubota writing the scripts, Tsuneo Ninomiya designing the characters and Mitsuhiro Tada composing the music. Both episodes feature an ending theme &quot;LOOK-ALIKE,&quot; composed and arranged by Tada and written and sung by Riyu Konaka. The OVA was originally distributed by Taki Corporation in Japan on a rental-only basis between January 26 and March 22 before being released for retail sale on May 31, 1996.

ADV Films announced they had licensed the OVA series at Project A-Kon 9, which took place in May 1998. It was dubbed in English and released as a single direct-to-video film under the name of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie&quot; on VHS and DVD on September 7, 1999, to coincide with the international release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; for the Dreamcast. It was later re-released on DVD on January 13, 2004. Due to ADV Films being dissolved and its assets being spun off into Section23 Films and Sentai Filmworks, both releases are now out of print.

Discotek Media has attempted to license the show for Blu-ray release in North America. However, Sega was unable to locate key documents related to the OVA&#x27;s music or voice actors.

== Reception ==
In the United States, the OVA reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; video sales chart and number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; kids&#x27; video sales chart.

The March 1996 issue of the &quot;DieHard Magazine&quot; gave the OVA a positive review stating that &quot;all in all, the artwork looks amazing, plus it&#x27;s an O.V.A., so the artists have been given quite an extensive budget. The animation is much cleaner than you could ever expect from a TV show, but the characters on-screen presence is what really makes Sonic so cool. It&#x27;s like playing the game, but in anime form. After the U.S. Sonic cartoon has been canceled, this anime is definitely a good choice.&quot;

Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar approved of the concept of a colorful, fast-paced anime adaptation of &quot;Sonic&quot;, noting the fights between Sonic and his evil counterpart, Metal Sonic, as &quot;cool.&quot; This is unfortunately accompanied by &quot;scenes of slapstick humor, anime cliches, and childish voice acting&quot; as well as the &quot;perpetually annoying&quot; Sara.

Chris Shepard of Anime News Network praised the OVA for its non-traditional action and said it was &quot;good for Sonic fans&quot;. He called the English dub poor, and said the story &quot;strayed from the video games a little too much&quot; and it was &quot;very basic&quot;.

John Sinnott of DVD Talk remarked &quot;it didn’t really pull me in at any time.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The &quot;Knuckles&quot; miniseries had the titular character wearing the hat he dons in the animation.

The &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; Archie Comics series contained various references to the OVA; in issue #101 the character Metal Robotnik appears in an alternate universe story, although his coloring altered from red to blue. Knuckles the Echidna also dons his hat from the film numerous times across the comic&#x27;s run.

The &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; IDW Comics series, like the Archie series before it, also contained many references to the O.V.A. In its ScrapNik Island miniseries, the character Mecha Knuckles from the game &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; (2001) makes his return with a new beaten up design, this new design sports a tattered version of Knuckles&#x27; OVA attire. In the final fight against Mecha Sonic in the Mini-Series, there are many homages to the film, including a scene mirroring the final interaction between Sonic and Metal Sonic in the OVA.

<text>Campus Club was one of the undergraduate eating clubs at Princeton University. Located on the corner of Washington Road and Prospect Avenue, Campus was founded in 1900. It was one of the eating clubs that abandoned the selective bicker process to choose members non-selectively, a status it held for over twenty years.

In an attempt to restore the waning popularity of the club, the club&#x27;s board pressured the undergraduate officers to reinstate bicker in 2004, causing Campus to become one of six selective clubs (out of eleven total clubs). However, due to the unpopularity of bicker among its members, the club returned to being a sign-in club in the spring of 2005. Facing another year of exceptionally low membership and resulting financial trouble, Campus Club closed later the same year.

In November 2005, the former members and alumni of Campus Club voted to donate the building to the university, under the condition that the mansion remain a social venue for Princeton students.

After undergoing renovations for over two years, Campus Club reopened on September 18, 2009, as a clubhouse open to all members of the Princeton community.

==History==

During the 1900–1901 school year, a number of undergraduates from the now-defunct Yama and Ovando Clubs took a lease on a small house on Olden Street in Princeton. Called &quot;The Incubator,&quot; the undergraduates used this house as a temporary location while they searched for a more permanent clubhouse.

In January 1901, the newly elected members of Campus Club began negotiations to purchase the residence of Professor Andrew Fleming West, which was located at the corner of Washington Road and Prospect Avenue (where Campus Club stands today). The club members financed the purchase of the West house through sale of approximately $45,000 of &quot;Princeton Campus Club Bonds.&quot; Once the residence was acquired, the new members began using the West residence as their clubhouse.

In 1909, the members of Campus Club elected to construct a new clubhouse, and the original West house was moved to the corner of Nassau Street and Princeton Avenue. The new clubhouse, designed by Raleigh C. Gildersleeve, who had previously designed McCosh Hall and completed alterations to Cap and Gown Club, was completed weeks prior to the 1910 commencement.

On November 24, 1951, a fire broke out inside of Campus Club. The fire caused extensive damage to the third floor, and a major renovation was required. Renovations were completed in 1953, and the club remained in this state until it was acquired by the university in 2005.

<doc id="558895" wikidata="Q334087" url="?curid=558895" title="Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves">
<text>Admiral Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves, KB (23 October 1725 – 9 February 1802) was a British officer of the Royal Navy and a colonial official. He served in the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American War of Independence. He was also the Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland for a period of time.

== Military career ==
Born in England in October 1725, Graves was the second son of Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves of Thanckes in Cornwall.

Graves&#x27; first military experience was as a volunteer with Commodore Henry Medley&#x27;s crew around 1740. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1743, and captain in 1755. In the first year of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Graves failed to confront a French ship which gave challenge. He was tried by court-martial for not engaging his ship, and reprimanded. Graves became Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland in 1761 and given the duty of convoying the seasonal fishing fleet from England to the island. In 1762 he learned that French ships had captured St. John&#x27;s. Graves, Admiral Alexander Colville and Colonel William Amherst retook the port city.

With the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Labrador came under his responsibility as French fishing fleets returned to the French Shore and St. Pierre and Miquelon. Graves strictly enforced the treaties to the extent that the French government protested. Graves&#x27; governorship ended in 1764. He returned to active service during the American War of Independence and became commander-in-chief of the North American Squadron in 1781. when Mariot Arbuthnot returned home.

During the American Revolution, his fleet was defeated by the Comte de Grasse in the Battle of the Chesapeake at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 5 September 1781, leading to the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown.

In September 1782, a fleet under his command was caught in a violent storm off the banks of Newfoundland. The captured French ships from the Battle of the Saintes (110 guns) and (74 guns), and the British ships (74 guns) and (74 guns) foundered, along with other merchant ships, with the loss of 3,500 lives. In 1786 Graves became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.

With the French Revolutionary Wars, Graves was second in command to Admiral Richard Howe at the British victory over the French at the Battle of the Glorious First of June 1794. Graves became a full admiral and was awarded an Irish peerage as Baron Graves, of Gravesend in the County of Londonderry.

== Personal life ==
Lord Graves married Elizabeth, daughter of William Peere Williams, in 1771. The couple had a son, Thomas, in 1775. Following several battle injuries, Graves retired to his Devon estate in 1794, and died in February 1802, aged 76.

<text>Elliot Budd Hopkins (June 15, 1931 – August 21, 2011) was an American artist, author, and ufologist. He was a prominent figure in alien abduction phenomena and related UFO research.

==Early life==
Elliot Budd Hopkins was born in 1931. He was raised in Wheeling, West Virginia. He lived with his parents, Elliot B. Hopkins and Eleanor A. Hopkins, brother, Stuart, and sister, Eleanor. At age two, Hopkins contracted polio. During the long recovery process, Hopkins developed an interest in drawing and watercolors, which eventually led him to Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio, where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art history in 1953. It was here, Hopkins was exposed to art with &quot;a capital A&quot;, and attended a lecture by Robert Motherwell that first introduced him to the &quot;automatic, gestural approach that Motherwell espoused.&quot;

From Oberlin, Hopkins moved to New York City, where he met Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and other abstract expressionists. For a time, Hopkins studied art history at Columbia University and worked a low-level job selling tickets at the Museum of Modern Art. His experimentation with collage techniques and style as an abstract expressionist won him national acclaim. 

==Art career==
Hopkins&#x27; first solo show was held in New York City in 1956, the same year he met and married his first wife of thirteen years, Joan Rich. In 1963, Hopkins&#x27; work was included in &quot;American Painters&quot;, a film documentary of American artists and styles with commentary from Alfred Barr of the Museum of Modern Art, Thomas Hess of Art News Magazine, Sidney Janis, gallery director, and Harold Rosenberg, art critic.

In 1969, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquired Hopkin&#x27;s &quot;Norbeck Yellow Vertical&quot;, describing him as &quot;a leading American painter who has successfully brought together the vocabularies of painterly abstraction and hard edge painting.&quot; In 1972, Hopkins was among five artists whose work was commissioned as part of a statewide effort to support the creative arts in West Virginia. It was, Governor Arch Moore claimed, &quot;the first project of this kind to be undertaken in the nation.&quot; The piece was to be displayed in the state&#x27;s cultural center located near the Capitol.

In 1976, Hopkins was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for painting.

===Exhibits===
Hopkins exhibited his paintings and sculptures in museums, galleries such as Andre Zarre, Levis Fine Art and Poindexter (New York) and Jan Cicero (Chicago), and universities throughout the United States.

Hopkins had a major retrospective exhibition at the Provincetown Art Association and Museum in mid-2017.

The Whitney Museum, Washington Gallery of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, the British Museum, include Hopkins&#x27; work in their permanent collections.

==Art style==
Hopkins&#x27; paintings in the 1960s combined the precise, hard-edge geometric shapes he was enthralled with and drawn to as a child with gestural, atmospheric painting characteristic of second- and later-generation Abstract Expressionists. &quot;I had come to understand that an abstract painting at its most powerful was a kind of aesthetic scrim behind which lurks a concealed, obsessive &#x27;thing&#x27; or image of some kind, transformed, made palatable by the artist&#x27;s mediating skills.&quot;

Hopkins viewed collage as an artistic technique and a philosophical, aesthetic means of unifying a disjointed and fragmented world. He saw collage, the assemblage of fragments and varying points of view, in the poetry, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, and, especially, motion pictures of his day:&quot;Consciously or unconsciously, contemporary artists work to create harmony from distinctly jarring material, forcing warring ideas, materials and spatial systems into a tense and perhaps arbitrary detente. Seen most broadly, the presence of the collage aesthetic is the sole defining quality of modernism in all the arts.&quot;

Hopkins worked to achieve harmony, clarity and precision while maintaining a sense of mystery: &quot;I like neither extreme in art wholeheartedly, neither the purified world of geometrical art nor the free, indulgent world of Expressionism.&quot;

In the 1970s, Hopkins&#x27; work included a series of assembled paintings, incorporating architectural elements. Sculptures such as &quot;Gallatin&#x27;s Drive I&quot;, &quot;White City Hall&quot;, &quot;New York Wall II&quot; and others bore urban names and echoed elements of New York City&#x27;s skyline. Many of his works during this time featured circular shapes with primary colors set against black and white backgrounds suggestive of Piet Mondrian.

Later, Hopkins included abstracted figures in his sculptural pieces. While moving away from Abstract Expressionism, Hopkins retained in his work the use of intense colors and hard-edged forms. His works of the 1980s, including Temples and Guardians, featured these &quot;sentinals&quot; who were, according to Hopkins, &quot;participating in a frozen ritual, fixed – absolutely – within a privileged space...&quot; Though Hopkins denied any connection, some critics viewed these ritualistic pieces as an extension of Hopkins&#x27; fascination with alien beings. Hopkins viewed his sculpted guardians not as human per se, but as magical, fierce, noble robots of the unconscious.

== Interest in UFOs ==
As a child, Hopkins experienced, firsthand, Orson Welles&#x27; 1938 radio play &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. This both terrified Hopkins and his family and left psychic scars. He considered the radio play a dramatic, theatrical hoax and, because of his childhood scare, felt it added to his skepticism about alien invasions rather than enamor him to the idea of it.

His interest in UFOs and alien visitations was renewed when, in August 1964, Hopkins and two others reported experiencing a day time sighting of an unidentified flying object, or UFO, in the form of a darkish, elliptical object off Cape Cod in Truro, MA. Dissatisfied with the response Hopkins received when he reported the incident to nearby Otis Air National Guard Base, he suspected a possible government cover-up. Hopkins began reading about UFOs and collecting stories of people who claimed to have experienced contact with alien beings.

In 1975, Hopkins was approached by George O&#x27;Barski who, purportedly, witnessed alien figures step out of a spacecraft and take soil samples at North Hudson Park in North Bergen, New Jersey. Hopkins, Ted Bloecher, then director of New York State&#x27;s Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and Jerry Stoehrer, also of MUFON, investigated the incident, interviewing the witness and taking soil samples.

After Hopkins&#x27; account of the O&#x27;Barski case appeared in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1976, he began receiving regular letters from other UFO witnesses, including a few cases of missing time, seemingly inexplicable gaps in abductees&#x27; memories. Hopkins, using data from his investigations with Bloecher and psychologist Aphrodite Clamar, expanded this idea in his book &quot;Missing Time&quot;.

Behavioral patterns extrapolated from abductee letters led Hopkins to identify core emotional responses based on their experiences: fear, awe or wonderment at alien technological abilities, affection toward their captors (which he likened to the &quot;Patty Hearst&quot; syndrome), anger, and helplessness. He believed aliens were either incapable of understanding the psychological effects of their encounters with humans or that they were a &quot;callous, indifferent, amoral race bent solely upon gratifying its own scientific needs at whatever cost to us.&quot;

After the publication of his book &quot;Missing Time&quot; in 1981, Hopkins became known as much for his UFO and abduction research as for his art. As a self-described humanist, Hopkins saw his work with alleged alien abduction victims as a way to bring attention to an otherwise marginalized part of society. His follow-up book &quot;Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods,&quot; published in 1987, helped establish Hopkins as a prominent leader in the UFO movement.

Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods&quot; (1987), spent four weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Paperback Best Seller list. It and other best-sellers on the phenomena, including Whitley Strieber&#x27;s 
&quot;Communion&quot; (1987), prompted stories of alien abduction by people who read the books. Abductee Linda Cortile had also participated in Hopkins&#x27; support group, starting five months before her alleged abduction, and read his book, &quot;Intruders&quot;.

In 1989, Hopkins organized the Intruders Foundation in Manhattan to provide support for alleged victims of alien abduction, conduct research and investigations, and promote public awareness of the phenomenon.

The 1992 made-for-television film &quot;Intruders&quot; featured fictionalized characters based on the works of Hopkins and psychiatrist John E. Mack, and, like Hopkins&#x27; book of the same name, portrayed abduction scenarios.

In 1996, Hopkins&#x27; book &quot;Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions&quot; was published. The book portrayed an abduction case that was alleged to have occurred in late 1989 near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.

Hopkins and his third wife, Carol Rainey, co-wrote the 2003 book &quot;Sight Unseen, Science, UFO Invisibility and Transgenic Beings&quot;.

===Alien abduction claims===

Hopkins is often credited with popularizing the idea of alien abductions as genetic experimentation through the publication of his book &quot;Intruders&quot;. He has been dubbed &quot;father of the abduction movement&quot; by some.

Hopkins, along with Elizabeth Slater, who conducted psychological tests of abductees, likened these experiences to rape, specifically for the purpose of human reproductive capabilities. In fact, Hopkins was inclined to dismiss his clients&#x27; conscious memory of abuse for more alien explanations. He was an alarmist, rather than a spiritualist, in his approach to the alien visitations, believing the visitations to be apocalyptic and that no good could come of these encounters. He described victims&#x27; experiences as severe and nightmarish.

While both men and women reported to Hopkins abductions by aliens that included sexual encounters, allegedly for some form of extraterrestrial eugenics, women in particular seemed to be a part of a &quot;highly technological colonization scheme.&quot; These victims were, reportedly, taken to spaceships, impregnated by extraterrestrials, then later as the hybrid baby developed, returned to the ship to have the fetus removed and given up to the alien parent. The alien parents, purportedly, had the ability to communicate telepathically with their child. On occasion, according to victims&#x27; reports as told by Hopkins, the human parents were allowed to see their human-alien hybrid, or transgenic, children. Once a victim, according to Hopkins, abductees were powerless over the intrusions and susceptible to additional kidnappings which may extend to their (human) children. &quot;If people have had one abduction experience,&quot; Hopkins said, &quot;then they will have others.&quot;

Critics of Hopkins&#x27; views on alien abductions state that the alien abduction phenomenon is not as mysterious as Hopkins makes it out to be. Much of the phenomenon can, according to researchers such as Ronald K. Siegel of the University of California, Los Angeles, be explained as the consequence of &quot;normal hallucinatory powers of the brain.&quot;

Sleep paralysis, for example, can produce the feeling that one is paralyzed or has difficulty moving. It can also produce the effect of floating or the sense of an out-of-body experience. Sleep paralysis occurs in a transition time and the person is in a dream-like state, hallucinations can occur just before falling asleep (hynogogic hallucination) or just after (hypnopompic hallucination). These hallucinations feel real to the person experiencing sleep paralysis and can often be accompanied by sensory features: musty smells, shuffling sounds, visions of ghosts, aliens, and monsters. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger of Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, believes that these sensations can spontaneously occur in some people, given the right set of circumstances, leading to the kind of feelings of &quot;tremendous meaningfulness and fear&quot; sometimes expressed by alleged alien abductees. Hopkins rejected the idea of sleep paralysis, calling it &quot;the big explanation du jour&quot;, and an inadequate explanation for those who experience abductions outside the bedroom.

====Roper poll====
Hopkins partnered with David M. Jacobs, history professor at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, and John Mack, psychiatry professor at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, to design a Roper poll to find out how many of the nearly 6,000 respondents surveyed had experienced what the three believed to be symptoms indicative of alien abductions. The poll was released in 1991. If generalized to the population at large, the survey results indicated that several million Americans are regularly affected by alien abductions.

Critics of the survey questioned the validity of the survey questions themselves and pointed out the implausibility that an average of 340 Americans could be abducted daily, given the fact that no physical evidence to date exists for any UFO abduction.

====Support groups====

Hopkins met and encouraged self-proclaimed abductees to discuss their experiences by holding free monthly group therapy sessions. Groups such as this were reported at the time as the most recent development in UFO-mania. Attendees represented people from all walks of life: attorneys, police officers, teachers, airline pilots, psychologists, psychiatrists, and the like. Drawing as many as 20 people each month, these support meetings were, according to Hopkins, like other New York social events, complete with &quot;dinner and a lot of social chatter.&quot;

Hopkins, trained as an artist not as a psychotherapist or social worker, described the people who attended these groups as veterans of trauma. They were, in his view, victims who experienced often intrusive and painful physical examinations by their alien abductors and whose stories were best told through hypnosis. Abduction memories, according to Hopkins, rarely emerged unaided and may, at first, present to the abductees as &quot;vague anxieties, specific phobias, bad dreams, fragmentary and disturbing memories, or what seemed like an explicable episode of missing time.&quot;

Many of his attendees contacted Hopkins after reading his books or newspaper advertisements that included his books as reference material, seeing him on television programs such as Will Shriner, Sally Jessy Raphael, the Marsha Warfield Show, Charles Grodin and others. Some critics interpreted these television appearances as a way for Hopkins and other UFO authors such as Whitley Strieber to recruit possible abductees.

Still other support group members attended the many UFO conferences held within the United States and internationally at which Hopkins was a speaker.

====Hypnosis====

Although Hopkins had no formal psychological training, he watched other professionals over an eight-year period and developed his own techniques. In his opinion, these professionals, notably Robert Naiman, Aphrodite Clamar, and Girard Franklin were quite skeptical of the reality of abduction claims, yet all uncovered detailed abduction scenarios from their patients.

According to Hopkins, any feeling of uneasiness about a place, or any sense of lost time (that is often accounted for by daydreaming), could be attributed to alien abduction. He believed aliens were capable of blocking or submerging memories in the people they abducted. Despite critics&#x27; warnings that practices such as the ones in which Hopkins engaged may cause serious psychological damage to the alleged abductees, Hopkins insisted that regressive hypnosis could unlock the experiences of his clients. He gave little credence to experts such as psychologist Robert A. Baker, University of Kentucky, whose scientific inquiries into the subject revealed that hypnosis can &quot;transform a dream, a hallucination or fantasy into a seemingly-real event.&quot; This transformation is known as the fabrication of spurious memories and is particularly common under hypnosis.

By 1995, Hopkins had worked with hundreds of abductees. It was during these hypnosis sessions that Hopkins&#x27; belief in UFO abduction deepened. To him, the purported similarities among client stories lent credibility to the abductees&#x27; stories. In actuality, the details of abductee stories varied greatly.

The idea of repressed memories has, largely, been dismissed by the scientific community. Psychological research demonstrates that, rather than forget what has happened in a traumatic event, most people find they are unable to stop thinking about it. What concerns critics is that the details of UFO abduction stories, such as the ones Hopkins describes in his work, usually occur only after consultation with some sort of UFO investigator who already has an inclination to believe in alien abduction scenarios. UFO critic Philip J. Klass characterizes these practices as a dangerous game.

UFO abductee stories are well-documented in the psychological literature and are considered culturally based. In other parts of the world, fairies, leprechauns, and other creatures replace aliens as abductors. Some liken extraterrestrial abduction to a secular version of the religious dream. According to Baker, &quot;These people are literally talked into believing they&#x27;ve been abducted.&quot;

The hypnotist can also, knowingly or unknowingly, create &quot;memories&quot; of an event that never occurred in their patients. In May 1987, psychologist and hypnotist Martin Reiser appeared on ABC&#x27;s 20/20 with host Lynn Sherr, an episode that also featured Hopkins and alleged UFO abductees, asserting that there are reasonable explanations for UFO sightings. His belief was that Hopkins pressured his subjects into believing UFOs exist.

Elizabeth Loftus, on NOVA&#x27;s &quot;Kidnapped by UFOs?&quot;, which aired on April 1, 1997 and included a taped hypnosis session conducted by Hopkins, identified &quot;subtle but powerful suggestive cues&quot; as Hopkins worked with two children as part of the investigative portion of the show. She cautioned that someone convinced of a false memory, can react emotionally to it and elaborate on the story as if it were real. Social psychologist Richard Ofshe concurred that suggestive influence may be a factor in Hopkins&#x27; support groups.

Of Hopkins&#x27; book, &quot;Intruders&quot;, Bettyann Kevles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;I am willing to believe that he believes everything he has written. I am also willing to believe that Kathie and the others experienced inexplicable time losses and strange dreams that may have not been dreams. But I am wary of the accuracy of the information he gathered through hypnosis. This kind of testimony is disallowed in most courts because hypnosis is not thoroughly understood and has proved unreliable as a source of evidence. Witnesses recall events that never occurred, but that they are later, on being brought out of hypnosis, convinced really happened.&quot;

Hopkins responded to critics by saying, &quot;I have often frequently invited interested therapists, journalists and academics to observe hypnosis sessions. Theoretical psychologist Nicholas Humphrey, who has held teaching positions at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and psychiatrist Donald F. Klein, director of research at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and professor of psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, are but two of those who have observed my work firsthand. None of these visitors ... have reported anything that suggested I was attempting to lead the subjects.&quot;

====Evidence====

Physical proof of alien abduction for Hopkins, came in the form of scoop marks, or indentations of the skin, scars or cuts on the mouth, nose, ears or genital, or unexplained bruises that might clear up in a day, and abductee claims of implants interpreted as control or monitoring devices similar to those used by (human) scientists to track and tag animals in the wild. He also believed the alien spacecraft left marks on the ground where they landed and that the aliens could be photographed.

Hopkins points to &quot;tightly imagined testimonies&quot; by abductees, included victims&#x27; stories of observing unconventional objects in the sky, in which they witnessed unusual activity (such as aliens digging for soil samples), flying through the air or being transported to a ship, a sense of being watched or the presence of hooded beings near the bed at night, a sense of paralysis or immobilization while lying in bed or in their cars, impressions of flying or passing through closed windows or walls, a feeling of having been outside upon awakening, invisibility (both alien and human) and, most especially, a sense of missing or lost time.

Hopkins believed in his data collection techniques, as outlined in &quot;Missing Time&quot;, and insisted, despite questions from other researchers and skeptics, that his findings were solidly based in evidence that, cumulatively, was overwhelming.
Despite Hopkins&#x27; oft-repeated assertion of &quot;powerful evidence&quot; for alien abduction, critics plagued his career with calls for tangible proof, which were never forthcoming: DNA from the hybrid babies, proof of implants that were alluded to (particularly in the case of alleged abductee Linda Cortile) but never recovered, photographs or videotapes of space craft or aliens. Critics, including his former wife, Rainey, expressed concern that UFO researcher leaders were not held to scholastic, scientific, or ethical standards.

Still others question whether it would be likely that alien abductors could actually float people through solid walls and, if they could, wonder at how these people could escape detection, particularly in urban settings where there would, potentially, be millions of people around to witness the event. Hopkins&#x27; response to the lack of UFO sightings by bystanders was to suggest that aliens could make themselves and their abductees invisible.

The lack of physical evidence and the inconsistencies and implausibility of the alien abduction stories led some critics, including Carl Sagan and author Jodi Dean, to question whether these memories are the product of internal, rather than external experiences.

==Criticism==
Critics of Hopkins&#x27; position that on alien abduction accounts had &quot;an absolute core of reality&quot; cautioned that media coverage might, inadvertently, be influencing alleged victims&#x27; stories. For example, &quot;The UFO Incident&quot;, a movie based on the Betty and Barney Hill case, aired on October 20, 1975, and exposed millions of viewers to the idea of alien abduction. Just one month later, O&#x27;Barski, Hopkins&#x27; neighbor and a New York City liquor store owner, approached him about seeing a spacecraft that, allegedly, landed in New Jersey&#x27;s North Hudson Park.

Conspiracy theories of government coverup of UFO sightings and visitations, such as the ones depicted in &quot;Nighteyes&quot; and &quot;Witnessed&quot; fueled the imaginations of those who belonged to UFO groups at the time. Some say the public&#x27;s interest in UFOs may have faded after the Cold War had it not been for the media&#x27;s depiction of and public sympathy for traumatized alien abductee television portrayals in the 1980s and 1990s.

Even Hopkins admitted that media attention had a way of &quot;contaminating the pool&quot; of subjects, but believed that he was able to cull the delusional stories from those he believed to be real. In his view, the repetition of certain experiences by abductees lent credibility to their stories, leading him to conclude that these accounts were not fantasy.

==Personal life and death==
By 1973, Hopkins was married to art critic, art historian, and curator April Kingsley, with whom he had a daughter, Grace Hopkins Their marriage ended in divorce in 1991.
In 1994, Hopkins met writer, filmmaker Carol Rainey, who became his third wife in 1996. They shared a mutual fascination with alien abduction stories and, according to Rainey, the possibility that people on Earth may have been &quot;seeded here by highly advanced beings or a Big Being from &#x27;out there&#x27;.&quot; The two co-wrote a book &quot;Sight Unseen, Science, UFO Invisibility and Transgenic Beings&quot;, which was published in 2003. They were married for 10 years.

On August 21, 2011, Hopkins died from complications of cancer. At the time of his death, he was in a relationship with journalist Leslie Kean.

<text>Frank T. Hopkins (August 11, 1865 unsubstantiated – November 5, 1951) was a self-proclaimed professional horseman who at one time performed with the Ringling Brothers Circus. He was a long-distance rider who claimed to have won 400 races and was recognized by his contemporaries as supporting the preservation of the mustang.

The film &quot;Hidalgo&quot; was based on Hopkins&#x27; purported story, and a few items in his accounts have been verified by outside, reliable, third-party sources. Some experts consider him to be a con-artist, but others side with assertions that he was not.

==Early life and education==
Hopkins said he was born to a Lakota mother, although this remains unsubstantiated, and European-American father, that he grew up in both cultures, and that he learned to ride and care for horses at an early age. He claimed that his father, Charles Hopkins, was a scout for George Armstrong Custer and he was captured by Chief Gall in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, but he was released four months later and returned to Fort Laramie, which is where Frank said he was born and raised (his father being with Custer cannot be substantiated). The Fort Laramie National Historic site has no record of his birth or family. There is a marriage certificate that Hopkins signed in New York in 1929 where his age was put at 44 which, if true, would place his birth in 1885. However, the photograph shown, said to have been taken in 1905, seems to show the appearance of a middle-aged man. Additionally, the Lakota Nation has no record of any member of his family being enrolled or associated with the nation.

==Career==
Hopkins claimed to have been a cowboy and professional horseman in the American West, where he gained a reputation for distance riding. In his autobiographical memoir (unpublished in his lifetime) and accounts to friends, he claimed to have been featured as one of the &quot;Rough Riders of the World&quot; in Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show, which toured in Europe as well as the United States.

A number of his stories have been debunked by many historians. Examples include:
* His claim to have been a rider with Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show was disputed by the curator of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, who said Hopkins&#x27; name is nowhere to be found in the archives. Hopkins has been found as listed in 1917 as being employed by the Ringling Brothers Circus as a horse handler.
* His claim to have brought &#x27;trick riding&#x27; to Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show has been disputed by the Georgian Cossack expert, Irakli Makharadze.
* His claim of being Native American, specifically Lakota, is not only unsubstantiated but the Lakota Nation has no record of him or his mother and does not claim either as members or any association.

In 1926 Hopkins was foreman of a construction crew, digging a subway tunnel in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In the 1940s, Hopkins claimed he was honorary chair at a Vermont Races, though the Vermont Historical Society has no knowledge of any races in Vermont. Hopkins also claimed to have won a Texas-to-Vermont endurance race at age 21, riding an 800-pound buckskin, but there is no evidence in contemporary sources that such a race was ever held. Up to the time of his death in 1951, he remained an outspoken champion of the threatened mustang which he called &quot;the most significant animal on the North American continent.&quot;

==Death==
Frank Hopkins is interred in Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens County, New York.

==In popular culture==
Hopkins&#x27; accounts of his life and the story of the race in Arabia were the inspiration for the 2004 film &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, written by John Fusco, directed by Joe Johnston, and starring Viggo Mortensen. The film marketed that it was &quot;based on a true story&quot; although subsequent investigations failed to find any evidence of such a race. Lakota scholar, historian and doctor Vine Deloria says &quot;Hopkins&#x27; claims are so outrageously false that one wonders why the people were attracted to this material at all.&quot;

<text>Joseph Albert &quot;Joe&quot; Morello (July 17, 1928 – March 12, 2011) was an American jazz drummer best known for serving as the drummer for pianist Dave Brubeck, as part of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, from 1957 to 1972, including during the quartet&#x27;s &quot;classic lineup&quot; from 1958 to 1968, which also included alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and bassist Eugene Wright. Morello&#x27;s facility for playing unusual time signatures and rhythms enabled that group to record a series of albums that explored them. The most notable of these was the first in the series, the 1959 album &quot;Time Out&quot;, which contained the hit songs &quot;Take Five&quot; and &quot;Blue Rondo à la Turk&quot;. In fact, &quot;Take Five&quot;, the album&#x27;s biggest hit (and the first jazz single to sell more than one million copies) was specifically written by Desmond as a way to showcase Morello&#x27;s ability to play in time.

Besides playing with Brubeck, Morello also served as an accompanist for other musicians, including Marian McPartland, Tal Farlow and Gary Burton, and recorded his own albums as well. He received numerous accolades during his life, including being named the best drummer by &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine five years in a row.

==Biography==

He was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States to Joseph Morello and Lillian LaPalme. His father was a French emigrant from Nice and his mother hailed from French Canada. Morello suffered from partial vision from birth, and devoted himself to indoor activities. At six years old, he began studying the violin. Three years later, he was a featured soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, playing Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto, and again three years later.

At the age of 15, Morello met the violinist Jascha Heifetz and decided that he would never be able to equal Heifetz&#x27;s &quot;sound&quot;. Therefore, he switched to drumming, first studying with a show drummer named Joe Sefcik and then George Lawrence Stone, author of the noted drum textbook &quot;Stick Control for the Snare Drummer&quot;. Stone was so impressed with Morello&#x27;s ideas that he incorporated them into his next book, &quot;Accents &amp; Rebounds&quot;, which is dedicated to Morello. Later, Morello studied with Radio City Music Hall percussionist, Billy Gladstone.

After moving to New York City, Morello worked with numerous notable jazz musicians including Johnny Smith, Tal Farlow, Stan Kenton, Phil Woods, Sal Salvador, Marian McPartland, Jay McShann, Art Pepper, and Howard McGhee. After a period of playing in McPartland&#x27;s trio, Morello declined invitations to join both Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s bands, favoring a temporary two-month tour with the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1955. Morello remained with Brubeck for well over a decade, departing in 1967. Morello later became an in-demand clinician, teacher and bandleader, whose former students include Danny Gottlieb, TigerBill Meligari, Bruce Springsteen E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg, Rich Galichon, Phish drummer Jon Fishman, Gary Feldman, Patrick Wante, Tony Woo, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons drummer Gerry Polci, Jerry Granelli, RIOT drummer Sandy Slavin, retired Army Blues drummer Steve Fidyk, Glenn Johnson, Pittsburgh drummer Bennett Carlise, &quot;Level System&quot; author and professional drummer Jeff W. Johnson, Jazz drummer John B. Riley, and Bon Jovi drummer Tico Torres.

Morello appeared in many Brubeck performances and contributed to over 60 albums with Brubeck. On &quot;Take Five&quot;, he plays an imaginative drum solo maintaining the 5/4 time signature throughout. Another example of soloing in odd time signatures can be heard on &quot;Unsquare Dance&quot;, in which he solos using only sticks without drums in 7/4 time. At the end of the track, he can be heard laughing about the &quot;trick&quot; ending. He also features on &quot;Blue Rondo à la Turk&quot;, &quot;Strange Meadow Lark&quot;, &quot;Pick-Up Sticks&quot; and &quot;Castilian Drums&quot;.

During his career, Morello appeared on over 120 albums. He authored several drum books, including &quot;Master Studies&quot;, published by Modern Drummer Publications, and also made instructional videos. Morello was the recipient of many awards, including &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s best drummer award for seven years in a row, and &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine&#x27;s best drummer award five years in a row. He was elected to the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine Hall of Fame in 1988, the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1993, and was the recipient of Hudson Music&#x27;s first TIP (Teacher Integration Program) Lifetime Achievement award in June, 2010.
Morello died at his home in Irvington, New Jersey, on March 12, 2011, aged 82, and is interred at Saint Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, Springfield, Massachusetts.

Upon his death, Morello&#x27;s wife Jean gave control of Joe Morello&#x27;s memorabilia and collections to Marvin Burock, one of Joe&#x27;s students, who had toured extensively with Morello and who was tasked with transcribing Morello&#x27;s &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; articles for ten years.

<text>Macular edema occurs when fluid and protein deposits collect on or under the macula of the eye (a yellow central area of the retina) and causes it to thicken and swell (edema). The swelling may distort a person&#x27;s central vision, because the macula holds tightly packed cones that provide sharp, clear, central vision to enable a person to see detail, form, and color that is directly in the centre of the field of view.

==Cause==
The causes of macular edema are numerous and different causes may be inter-related.

*It is commonly associated with diabetes. Chronic or uncontrolled diabetes type 2 can affect peripheral blood vessels including those of the retina which may leak fluid, blood and occasionally fats into the retina causing it to swell.
*Age-related macular degeneration may cause macular edema. As individuals age there may be a natural deterioration in the macula which can lead to the depositing of drusen under the retina sometimes with the formation of abnormal blood vessels.
*Replacement of the lens as treatment for cataract can cause pseudophakic macular edema (&#x27;pseudophakia&#x27; means &#x27;replacement lens&#x27;), also known as Irvine–Gass syndrome. The surgery involved sometimes irritates the retina (and other parts of the eye) causing the capillaries in the retina to dilate and leak fluid into the retina. This is less common today with modern lens replacement techniques. 
*Chronic uveitis and intermediate uveitis can be a cause. 
*Blockage of a vein in the retina can cause engorgement of the other retinal veins causing them to leak fluid under or into the retina. The blockage may be caused, among other things, by atherosclerosis, high blood pressure and glaucoma.
*A number of drugs can cause changes in the retina that can lead to macular edema. The effect of each drug is variable and some drugs have a lesser role in causation. The principal medications known to affect the retina are latanoprost, epinephrine, rosiglitazone, timolol and thiazolidinediones among others.
*A few congenital diseases are known to be associated with macular edema, for example retinitis pigmentosa and retinoschisis.

==Diagnosis==

===Classification===

Cystoid macular edema (CME) involves fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer secondary to abnormal perifoveal retinal capillary permeability. The edema is termed &quot;cystoid&quot; as it appears cystic; however, lacking an epithelial coating, it is not truly cystic. The cause for CME can be remembered with the mnemonic &quot;DEPRIVEN&quot; (diabetes, epinepherine, pars planitis, retinitis pigmentosa, Irvine-Gass syndrome, venous occlusion, E2-prostaglandin analogues, nicotinic acid/niacin).

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is similarly caused by leaking macular capillaries. DME is the most common cause of visual loss in both proliferative, and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

==Treatment==
Macular edema sometimes occurs for a few days or weeks (sometimes even much longer) after cataract surgery, but most such cases can be successfully treated with NSAID or cortisone eye drops. Prophylactic use of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported to reduce the risk of macular edema to some extent. Higher frequency use of topical steroids provides benefit in difficult to treat cases.

Diabetic macular edema may be treated with laser photocoagulation, reducing the chance of vision loss.

In 2010, the US FDA approved the use of Lucentis intravitreal injections for macular edema.

Iluvien, a sustained release intravitreal implant developed by Alimera Sciences, has been approved in Austria, Portugal and the U.K. for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic diabetic macular edema (DME) considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. Additional EU country approvals are anticipated.

In 2013 Lucentis by intravitreal injection was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK for the treatment of macular edema caused by diabetes and/or retinal vein occlusion.

On July 29, 2014, Eylea (aflibercept), an intravitreal injection produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., was approved to treat DME in the United States. On January 28, 2022, Vabysmo, a different injectable eye medication produced by Genentech was approved to treat both Wet AMD and DME in the United States.

==Research==
In 2005, steroids were investigated for the treatment of macular edema due to retinal blood vessel blockage such as CRVO and BRVO.

A 2014 Cochrane Systematic Review studied the effectiveness of two anti-VEGF treatments, ranibizumab and pegaptanib, on patients with macular edema caused by CRVO. Participants on both treatment groups showed a reduction in macular edema symptoms over six months.

Another Cochrane Review examined the effectiveness and safety of two intravitreal steroid treatments, triamcinolone acetonide and dexamethasone, for patients with from CRVO-ME. The results from one trial showed that patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide were significantly more likely to show improvements in visual acuity than those in the control group, though outcome data was missing for a large proportion of the control group. The second trial showed that patients treated with dexamethasone implants did not show improvements in visual acuity, compared to patients in the control group.

Intravitreal injections and implantation of steroids inside the eye may result in a small improvement of vision for people with chronic or refractory diabetic macular edema. There is low certainty evidence that there does not appear to be any additional benefit of combining anti-VEGF and intravitreal steroids when compared to either treatment alone.

Anti‐tumour necrosis factor agents have been proposed as a treatment for macular oedema due to uveitis but a Cochrane Review published in 2018 found no relevant randomised controlled trials.

<text>Lomonosov (; before 1948: Oranienbaum, ) is a municipal town in Petrodvortsovy District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, Russia, located on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, west of Saint Petersburg proper. Population: Lomonosov is the site of the 18th-century royal Oranienbaum park and palace complex, notable as being the only palace in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg that was not captured by Nazi Germany during World War II.

== History ==
Oranienbaum was granted town status in 1710, and was initially applied to the Oranienbaum palace complex, built between 1710 and 1725 opposite Kronstadt, in the neighbourhood of the royal residence Peterhof Palace, by the architects Giovanni Mario Fontana and Gottfried Johann Schadel, and was intended for Alexander Menshikov, a close associate of Peter the Great. The original name of the town translates to &quot;orange tree&quot; in German (in modern German, the word is &quot;Orangenbaum&quot;), and is believed to have been derived from the palace complex which had greenhouses to grow exotic plants such as orange trees. According to another version, the name means “Tree of Orange” in honour of William III of Orange, stadtholder of the Netherlands and king of England, who was the idol of Peter the Great, or it was borrowed from the toponymy of Germany (the city of Oranienbaum in the Principality of Anhalt named by Princess Henrietta Katharina Nassau-Oransky after her home place) simply as a “beautiful” name in the fashion spirit of the Petrine era.

During World War II the town was heavily involved in the Siege of Leningrad, where Red Army forces managed to 
establish a foothold at Oranienbaum, in the rear of the forces of Nazi Germany. This foothold had a major importance in the launching of the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive in early 1944, which finally ended the siege (see Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive). In 1948, the town was renamed to its current name Lomonosov, in honor of the scientist, poet and glassblower Mikhail Lomonosov. In 1754, Lomonosov had founded a colored-glass factory near Oranienbaum, in the village of Ust-Ruditsa. An unofficial nickname, &quot;Rambov&quot;, a Russified contraction of the old name Oranienbaum, is popular among the local residents.

Lomonosov can be reached by suburban train from St. Petersburg&#x27;s Baltic Terminal to Oranienbaum Station.

==People from Oranienbaum==
* Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), composer of modern classical music
* Aleksandr Mostovoi, footballer

==International relations==
===Twin towns and sister cities===
Lomonosov is twinned with:
* Mariehamn, Åland, Finland
* Framingham, Massachusetts, United States
* Anacortes, Washington, United States
* Oberursel (Taunus), Hesse, Germany (suspended in 2022)

<text>Rashied Ali, born Robert Patterson (July 1, 1933 – August 12, 2009), was an American free jazz and avant-garde drummer who was best known for performing with John Coltrane in the last years of Coltrane&#x27;s life.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Patterson was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His family was musical; his mother sang with Jimmie Lunceford. His brother, Muhammad Ali, is also a drummer, who played with Albert Ayler. Ali, his brother, and his father converted to Islam.

Starting off as a pianist, he eventually took up the drums, via trumpet and trombone. He joined the United States Army and played with military bands during the Korean War. After his military service, he returned home and studied with Philly Joe Jones, then toured with Sonny Rollins.

===Career===
Ali moved to New York in 1963 and worked in groups with Bill Dixon and Paul Bley. He was scheduled to be the second drummer alongside Elvin Jones on John Coltrane&#x27;s free jazz album &quot;Ascension&quot;, but he dropped out just before the recording was to take place. Coltrane did not replace him and settled for one drummer. Ali recorded with Coltrane beginning in 1965 on the album &quot;Meditations&quot;.

Among his credits are the last recorded work by Coltrane (&quot;The Olatunji Concert&quot;) and &quot;Interstellar Space&quot;, an album of duets recorded earlier in 1967. Ali &quot;became important in stimulating the most avant-garde kinds of jazz activities,&quot; playing what Coltrane described as &quot;multi-directional rhythms&quot;. After Coltrane&#x27;s death, Ali performed with his widow, pianist Alice Coltrane. During the early 1970s, he ran Ali&#x27;s Alley, a loft club in New York City, and founded his own label, Survival Records.
He was a visiting artist at Wesleyan University, sponsored by Clifford Thornton. Ali also briefly formed a non-jazz group called Purple Trap with Japanese experimental guitarist Keiji Haino and jazz-fusion bassist Bill Laswell. Their album, &quot;Decided...Already the Motionless Heart of Tranquility, Tangling the Prayer Called &quot;I&quot;&quot;, was released by Tzadik Records in March 1999.

During the 1980s, he was member of Phalanx, a group with guitarist James Blood Ulmer, tenor saxophonist George Adams, and bassist Sirone.

In 1985, Ali performed with the band There Goes the Neighborhood with Jaco Pastorius, Jorma Kaukonen, Doug McClean, Whitie Melvin, and Ben Prevo. From 1997 to 2003 he played extensively with Tisziji Munoz in a group that usually included Pharoah Sanders.

Though known for his work in jazz, Ali contributed to other experimental art forms, including multi-media performances with the Gift of Eagle Orchestra and Cosmic Legends, performances such as Devachan and the Monads, Dwarf of Oblivion, which took place at The Kitchen Center for Performance Art, and a tribute to John Cage in New York&#x27;s Central Park. Other artists of the orchestra and Cosmic Legends have included Hayes Greenfield (sax), Perry Robinson (clarinet), Wayne Lopes (guitar), Dave Douglas (trumpeter), Gloria Tropp (vocals), Louise Landes Levi (sarangi), director/pianist Sylvie Degiez along with poets and actors Ira Cohen, Taylor Mead, and Judith Malina.

===Later life===
During the last years of his life, Ali led his own quintet. A double album entitled &quot;Judgment Day&quot; was recorded in February 2005 and features Jumaane Smith on trumpet, Lawrence Clark on tenor saxophone, Greg Murphy on piano, and Joris Teepe on bass. This album was recorded at Ali&#x27;s own Survival Studio, which has been in existence since the 1970s.

In addition to his performance activities, Ali served as mentor to young drummers such as Matt Smith.

In 2007, Ali recorded &quot;Going to the Ritual&quot; in duo with bassist/violinist Henry Grimes with a second duo recording in post-production at the time of Ali&#x27;s death. Ali and Grimes also played five duo concerts together between 2007 and 2009 and a sixth concert in June 2007 with pianist Marilyn Crispell. Ali is the featured drummer on Azar Lawrence&#x27;s album &quot;Mystic Journey&quot;, recorded in April 2009 and released in May 2010.

==Death==
Rashied Ali died at the age of 76 in a Manhattan hospital after suffering a heart attack. He was survived by wife Patricia and three children.

<text>Bernard Joseph Baron (born June 26, 1955 in Richmond, Virginia) is an American drummer best-known for working in avant-garde jazz with Bill Frisell and John Zorn.

==Music career==
Baron, who is of Jewish heritage, was born on June 26, 1955, in Richmond, Virginia. When he was nine, he taught himself how to play the drums. As a teenager, he played in rock bands and dixieland jazz groups and was given his first gig opportunity at the age of 13 when pianist BJ Doyle&#x27;s regular drummer took ill and she knew he was a keeper after just minutes. After high school, he spent a year at the Berklee College of Music. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s and embarked on a professional career, playing with Carmen McRae and Al Jarreau. He worked as a freelance drummer and session musician with Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, and Hampton Hawes.

In 1982 he moved to New York City and joined guitarist Bill Frisell, with whom he would play often throughout his career. He also played in groups with Red Rodney, Fred Hersch, Enrico Pieranunzi, and Marc Johnson. Starting in the late 1980s, he became a bigger part of the avant-garde jazz scene when he played regularly at the Knitting Factory, recorded with singer Laurie Anderson, and began a long association with John Zorn. For several years he participated in Zorn&#x27;s projects Naked City and Masada.

Baron contributed to David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Outside&quot; (1995). Bowie would later praise Baron, stating: &quot;Metronomes shake in fear, he&#x27;s so steady.&quot;

<text>Port Hedland (Kariyarra: Marapikurrinya) is the second largest town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with an urban population of 15,298 as of the , including the satellite town of South Hedland, away. It is also the site of the highest tonnage port in Australia.

== Economy ==
Port Hedland has a natural deep anchorage harbour which, as well as being the main fuel and container receival point for the region, was seen as perfect for shipment of the iron ore being mined in the ranges located inland from the town. The ore is moved by railway from four major iron ore deposits to the east and south of the Port Hedland area. The port exported of iron ore (2017–2018).
Other major resource activities supported by the town include the offshore natural gas fields, salt, manganese, and livestock. Major deposits of lithium are being developed and exploited south of the town as well. Grazing of cattle and sheep was formerly a major revenue earner for the region, but this has slowly declined. Port Hedland was also formerly the terminus for the WAGR Marble Bar Railway, which serviced the gold mining area of Marble Bar from July 1911 until closure on 31 October 1951. The locomotive from the Port Hedland to Marble Bar rail service is now preserved at the Kalamunda Historical Village in the south of the state. 
Located between Port Hedland and South Hedland are the large salt hills of Dampier Salt, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. These large mounds have almost become a tourist attraction in their own right.

== History ==

Port Hedland is known by the Indigenous Kariyarra and Nyamal people as Marapikurrinya, which either means &quot;place of good water&quot; (as told by a Nyamal language speaker) and makes reference to the three reliable fresh water soaks that can still be seen in and around the town, or as the town council&#x27;s website says &quot;refers to the hand like formation of the tidal creeks coming off the harbour (marra - hand, pikurri - pointing straight and nya - a place name marker)&quot;. According to Dreamtime legend, there was a huge blind water snake living in the landlocked area of water known as Jalkawarrinya. This landlocked area is now the turning basin for the ships that enter the port and as the story goes, &quot;the coming of the big ships meant it was unable to stay&quot;.

The coastline in the area was seen by European mariners as early as 1628, when the Dutch merchant ship &quot;Vianen&quot;, captained by Gerrit Franszoon de Witt visited.

Swedish-born mariner Peter Hedland was the first European to note the harbour&#x27;s existence and the possibility of using it as a port. Peter Hedland arrived in the area in April 1863 on board his boat &quot;Mystery&quot;, which he had built himself at Point Walter on the banks of the Swan River. He named the harbour Mangrove Harbour and reported that it would make a good landing site with a well protected harbour, and that there was also fresh water available. However, the port was initially regarded as unusable, due to a sandbar that frequently sealed the entrance and thick mangroves around the shore; further, the narrow entrance made the harbour difficult to enter in bad weather.

Later in 1863, government surveyor Joseph Beete Ridley examined Mangrove Harbour while exploring the country between Nicol Bay and the Fitzroy River, describing it as &quot;an excellent anchorage and perfectly landlocked&quot;. He named it Port Hedland after the master of &quot;Mystery&quot;. Ridley located a firm landing place above the mangroves, and a practicable stockroute from there to the De Grey River.

In 1866, the Government Resident at Roebourne, Robert John Sholl, directed Charles Wedge to re-examine Port Hedland as an alternative port, because the distance from Tien Tsin Harbour (later known as Cossack) was discouraging settlement in areas such as the De Grey River. Wedge encountered difficulties in his efforts, as he was hampered by heavy rain and the tidal creeks around Mangrove Harbour and was unable to reach the proposed port site to survey its suitability.

In 1891, exploration of the area by Tom Traine, John Wedge (son of Charles Wedge) and Syd Hedley identified two landings and described the harbour as &quot;pretty as well as safe&quot;. In September 1895, Cossack residents requested the District Surveyor survey the headland at Port Hedland in order to establish a town and requested that the Government build a jetty.

In 1896, the Port Hedland town site was surveyed by government surveyor E.W. Geyer, who named the grid of streets after the pastoral pioneers, including Richardson, Withnell, Wedge and McKay streets, and in October 1896, the town site was gazetted.

By 1905, the Roads Board had made considerable improvements to the roads and streets. In 1909 port facilities were built, and in 1911 a rail link to Marble Bar commenced operation.

On 30 July 1942 the town was bombed by the Japanese, killing one soldier at the local airfield.

By 1946, approximately 150 people lived in the area.

The population of the town in 1968 was about 3,000 people.

=== Mining ===
Goldsworthy Mining developed an iron ore mine approximately 100 kilometres east of Port Hedland in the early 1960s and built the towns of Goldsworthy and later Shay Gap as mine sites. A rail line was then built to Port Hedland, where dredging was undertaken to deepen and widen the port&#x27;s channel, and a wharf was built opposite the township of Port Hedland on Finucane Island. Shipment of ore began on 27 May 1966, when the &quot;Harvey S. Mudd&quot; sailed from Port Hedland to Japan with 24,900 tonnes of ore.

In 1967, iron ore was discovered at Mount Whaleback, and a mining venture was undertaken that included the establishment of a new town, Newman, 426 km of rail from the mine to the port and the development of processing equipment at both Newman and Port Hedland. In 1986, at a cost of $87 million, the existing channel was dredged to allow larger ships to enter the port. Prior to dredging, the port was only able to load vessels of less than 2,000 tonnes, but today it is able to accommodate ships over 250,000 tonnes.

In 2013, finance was being raised for yet another iron ore mine, railway and port, this time for the Roy Hill project. It requires a 344 km railway.

With the neighbouring ports of Port Walcott and Dampier, Port Hedland is one of three major iron ore exporting ports in the Pilbara region.

=== 1968 plane crash ===

On 31 December 1968, a Vickers Viscount operated by MacRobertson Miller Airlines crashed at nearby Indee Station. The plane had flown from Perth without incident until about 10 minutes before landing at Port Hedland. The aircraft suffered catastrophic failure of the spar in the right wing. The wing suddenly separated from the fuselage. All 26 on board, including both pilots and two flight attendants, were killed.

=== Immigration detention facility ===
In 1991, an immigration detention facility, the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, was opened to deal with the arrival of boat people seeking asylum. Port Hedland was seen as a good location, as it is in an area where many asylum seekers arriving by boat were entering Australia, and it had an international airport that would allow for easy deportations when required. The detention centre, situated on the beach front, was formerly a single-men&#x27;s quarters for Mount Newman Mining Co. The centre was privatised by the first Howard Ministry in the late 1990s. It was closed in 2004 due to the falling number of asylum seekers arriving by boat in Australia&#x27;s north-west. The town mayor called for the federal government to allow the town to use the detention centre to accommodate the many new mine workers needed for the town&#x27;s mining boom. A lack of accommodation made it difficult for companies to operate efficiently, as they were unable to house staff or consultants within the town&#x27;s small number of hotels. The centre is now operating as the Beachfront Village.

=== West End ===

In October 2019 the state government announced an Improvement Plan would be imposed over the West End of Port Hedland. The purpose of the plan was to prohibit all future residential development due to the health impacts caused by dust levels generated by Port activities.

=== Cyclones ===

On 13 April 2023 Cyclone Ilsa, a large and destructive category 5 tropical cyclone, made landfall just east of the port city.

In January 2025, the port was closed by its operator Pilbara Ports Authority due to a tropical cyclone threat.

== Climate ==
Port Hedland has a hot desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;) although subject to the influence of tropical cyclones. Port Hedland is very warm to sweltering all year round, with mean maximum temperatures of in January and in July. Maximum temperatures in summer are usually moderated by a warm but humid sea breeze. Port Hedland is very sunny, averaging over 10 hours of sunshine per day annually and being in the sunniest region of Australia, receiving around 218.9 clear days annually. Dewpoint in the warmer months typically ranges from .

Annual rainfall (falling almost exclusively between December and June) averages but because of erratic cyclones is subject to some of the largest variations in annual precipitation in the world. As an illustration, in 1942, fell, but two years later in 1944 only fell and the town went for over 300 days with no rain. The town received record daily rainfall on 27 January 1967 when a total of of rainfall was recorded for 24 hours, which is more than the mean annual rainfall. The high summer temperatures experienced in Port Hedland mean that most tourists to the area choose to visit in the cooler months between May and September.

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the Western Pilbara, including Port Hedland is the sunniest place in Australia; being the only place to record an annual average of more than 10 hours a day of sunshine.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Harbour ===
Port Hedland&#x27;s harbour is managed by the Pilbara Ports Authority, a state government instrumentality. The Port Authority&#x27;s headquarters, control tower and heliport are at Mangrove Point, just to the west of The Esplanade at the western end of Port Hedland. The tugboat pen, customs office and public jetty are at nearby Laurentius Point.

The harbour&#x27;s wharves are located on both sides of the harbour: Finucane Island to the west and Port Hedland to the east. Access by oceangoing vessels into and out of the harbour is via a narrow curved channel.

The current control tower was opened in 2019.

===Education===
The area contains five primary schools (four government, one Catholic), along with Hedland Senior High School, Port Hedland School of the Air and the Cassia Education Support Centre.

== Fauna and flora ==
Port Hedland has a flatback sea turtle rookery, located on the main beach front. Several lookouts along the beach front path allow views of marine mammals including Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins.

The Port Hedland Saltworks Important Bird Area is a 103 km2 tract of originally intertidal land, now containing a saltern, about 20 km east of the port of Port Hedland. The site regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of red-necked stints and sharp-tailed sandpipers, as well as a population of the range-restricted dusky gerygone. Species that have strongly declined since the 1980s are broad-billed sandpipers, Asian dowitchers, curlew sandpipers, red-necked avocets, banded stilts, Oriental plovers, Oriental pratincoles and white-winged black terns. Other species present include Australian bustards, bush stone-curlews, western bowerbirds, painted finches and canary white-eyes.

Estuaries such as Pretty Pool support mangroves, marine fish, and birds.

== Environmental issues ==

Pollution from iron ore dust regularly exceeds national standards. The local hospitalisation rate for respiratory infections is 30% higher than the Western Australian average.

== Blackrock Stakes ==
The Blackrock Stakes was a 122 km race from Goldsworthy to Port Hedland in which competitors, either in teams or as individuals, push wheelbarrows weighed down with iron ore. It was first run in 1971, and competitors pushed a wheelbarrow full of iron ore from a remote mine site into Port Hedland. After that the race grew to raise more than $1 million for charity as a modified version where teams of 10, trios, duos and lone runners pushed modified wheelbarrows containing 11 kg of iron ore over the distance. The last race was run in 2010, as the growth in mining made the route too dangerous.

<text>Jim Black is an American jazz drummer who has performed with Tim Berne and Dave Douglas. He attended Berklee College of Music.

==Career==
His band AlasNoAxis includes Hilmar Jensson on electric guitar, Chris Speed on tenor saxophone and clarinet, and Skúli Sverrisson on bass guitar. The music is in some ways closer to post-rock than jazz, concentrating on rhythmic shifts and ensemble texture rather than featured solos. Since 2000 Winter &amp; Winter has released several of the band&#x27;s albums.

Pachora includes Black, Speed, Sverrisson, and Brad Shepik on tambura and electric saz. This band plays music that is rhythmically diverse and inspired by Balkan rhythms.

Black participated as drummer 12 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance on July 7, 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.

He is also one-third of the group BBC (Berne/Black/Cline) with alto saxophonist Berne and Nels Cline of Wilco. The group released the album &quot;The Veil&quot; in 2011.

<text>Michael Hardt (born 1960) is an American political philosopher and literary theorist. Hardt is best known for his book &quot;Empire&quot;, which was co-written with Antonio Negri. 

Hardt and Negri suggest that several forces which they see as dominating contemporary life, such as class oppression, globalization and the commodification of services (or production of affects), have the potential to spark social change of unprecedented dimensions. A sequel, &quot;&quot; was published in August 2004. It outlines an idea first propounded in &quot;Empire&quot;, which is that of the multitude as possible locus of a democratic movement of global proportions. The third and final part of the trilogy, &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, was published in 2009.

==Early life and education==
Hardt attended Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland. He studied engineering at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania from 1978 to 1983. In college during the 1970s energy crisis, he began to take an interest in alternative energy sources. Talking about his college politics, he said, &quot;I thought that doing alternative energy engineering for third world countries would be a way of doing politics that would get out of all this campus political posing that I hated. It seemed that way, but I was quickly disabused.&quot;

During college, he worked for various solar energy companies. Hardt also participated, after college, in the Sanctuary Movement and later helped establish a project to bring donated computers from the United States and put them together for the University of El Salvador. Yet, he says that this political activity did more for him than it did for the Salvadorans.

In 1983, he moved to Seattle to study comparative literature at the University of Washington. While working on his PhD, Hardt began to translate Antonio Negri&#x27;s book on Baruch Spinoza, &quot;The Savage Anomaly&quot;, in order to come into contact with him. He first met Negri in Paris in the summer of 1986 to discuss translation difficulties. After their meeting, Hardt decided to complete his graduate exams and move to Paris the following summer. He received an M.A. in 1986 and completed his dissertation on Gilles Deleuze in 1990, with which he earned his PhD.

After briefly teaching at the University of Southern California, Hardt began teaching in the Literature Program at Duke University in 1994. He is currently professor of Literature and Italian at Duke.

==Thought==
Hardt is concerned with the joy of political life, and has stated, &quot;One has to expand the concept of love beyond the limits of the couple.&quot; The politics of the multitude is not solely about controlling the means of productivity or liberating one&#x27;s own subjectivity. These two are also linked to love and joy of political life and realizing political goals.

Hardt does not consider teaching a revolutionary occupation, nor does he think the college is a particularly political institution. &quot;But thinking of politics now as a project of social transformation on a large scale, I&#x27;m not at all convinced that political activity can come from the university.&quot;

Hardt says visions of a public education and equal and open access to the university are gradually disappearing: the &quot;war on terror&quot; has promoted only limited military and technological knowledges, while the required skills of the biopolitical economy, &quot;the creation of ideas, images, code, affects, and other immaterial goods&quot; are not yet recognized as the primary key to economic innovation. Many of Hardt&#x27;s works have been co-written with Antonio Negri.

==Occupation movements of 2011–2012==

In May 2012 Hardt and Negri self-published an electronic pamphlet on the occupation and encampment movements of 2011-2012 called &quot;Declaration&quot; that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy.

<doc id="558946" wikidata="Q911894" url="?curid=558946" title="Brian Blade">
<text>Brian Blade (born July 25, 1970) is an American jazz drummer, composer, and session musician.

==Early life==

Born and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana, Blade was exposed to gospel and praise music while attending Zion Baptist Church at which his father, Brady L. Blade Sr., was pastor. Blade initially began learning violin and participated in the church choir, an experience which Blade later acknowledged was influential in his musical development. Following in the footsteps of his older brother, Brady Blade Jr., Blade developed skills on the drum kit while &#x27;depping&#x27; for his brother in the church band. Soon after Blade shifted his focus to the drums throughout middle and high school.

During high school, while studying with Dorsey Summerfield Jr., Blade began listening to the music of John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk, and became increasingly influenced by the drumming styles of Elvin Jones, Art Blakey, Papa Jo Jones, and Paul Motian. By the age of eighteen, Brian moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University. From 1988 through 1993, he studied and played with most of the master musicians living in New Orleans, including Johnny Vidacovich, Ellis Marsalis, Steve Masakowski, Bill Huntington, Mike Pellera, John Mahoney, George French, Germaine Bazzle, David Lee Jr., Alvin Red Tyler, Tony Dagradi and Harold Battiste.

== Career ==
In 1992 Blade settled in New York and quickly cultivated a reputation as a &#x27;first-call&#x27; drummer, including sideman work for Kenny Garrett, Mark Turner, and Joshua Redman. In 1997, Blade formed The Fellowship Band with pianist Jon Cowherd, bassist Chris Thomas, saxophonists Myron Walden and Melvin Butler, guitarist Jeff Parker, and pedal steel guitarist Dave Easley. The band released its debut album in 1998, &quot;Brian Blade Fellowship&quot;, and emerged as an innovative proponent of new jazz throughout subsequent decades.

Reviewing the ensemble&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Landmarks&quot; album, John Kelman wrote:

As the Fellowship Band has grown, it has moved away from overt traditional references, even though they&#x27;re an undercurrent throughout. Instead, as it explores milestones both inner and outer, Landmarks further speaks with the singular voice that the Fellowship Band has built upon since inception. Blending folkloric references, hints of church and spiritual concerns, jazz modality and countrified touchstones, Landmarks is the perfect name for Brian Blade &amp; The Fellowship Band&#x27;s fourth album; beyond its meaning to the group, it truly is yet another landmark recording in the core quintet&#x27;s evolutionary travels. It may have come after a long gap in time, but that only makes it a wait all the more worthwhile.
While continuing his work with the Fellowship Band, Blade emerged as an ongoing member of Wayne Shorter&#x27;s quartet, working with Shorter from 2000 until his death. Shorter&#x27;s quartet, also featuring Danilo Pérez and John Patitucci, became widely revered by jazz critics for their &quot;near-telepathic&quot; musical symbiosis. Blade&#x27;s creative contribution to Shorter&#x27;s quartet was frequently considered a key component of the group&#x27;s creativity. In addition to his collaborations with Wayne Shorter, Blade has remained an in demand drummer for the likes of Joshua Redman, Brad Mehldau, Christian McBride, Chick Corea, Wolfgang Muthspiel, Joni Mitchell, Ellis Marsalis Jr., Billy Childs, Herbie Hancock, Norah Jones, among many others.

During his career Blade has often performed outside his usual musical idiom, recording with the likes of Marianne Faithfull, Emmylou Harris, Bob Dylan, and Daniel Lanois. In 2009, Blade released &quot;Mama Rosa,&quot; his first album as a singer-songwriter, with songs dedicated to his grandmother and family. The live band includes Steven Nistor on drums.

On April 30, 2016, Blade played at the White House in Washington, D.C., as part of The International Jazz Day Global Concert.

== Honors ==
*2013: ECHO Jazz Award &quot;International Artist of the Year Drums/Percussion&quot;, for &quot;Quiver&quot;.
*2013: Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for &quot;Trilogy&quot; (Concord), with Chick Corea.

==Equipment==

Blade uses vintage Gretsch, Ludwig, Sonor and Slingerland drums. He plays Canopus drums when touring in Japan. He has used a variety of cymbals over the years, including multiple ride cymbals made by Roberto Spizzichino, vintage A Zildjians, and often a 22&quot; Zildjian K Constantinople Light Ride (discontinued model). His acoustic guitar is a mid-1950s Gibson LG-3.

<doc id="558954" wikidata="Q1701251" url="?curid=558954" title="John Oliver (British Columbia politician)">
<text>John Oliver (July 31, 1856 – August 17, 1927) was a British-Canadian politician and farmer, who served as the 19th premier of British Columbia. As a prominent figure in the province’s early political landscape, Oliver served in various capacities, including as leader of the Opposition and minister of Agriculture, and contributed significantly to the development of British Columbia’s agricultural and railway sectors.

A member of the former British Columbia Liberal Party, Oliver was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1900 provincial election. After serving as the leader of the Opposition, he lost his seat in 1909 but returned the legislature in the 1916 election. That year, he was appointed minister of Agriculture and minister of Railways in premier Harlan Carey Brewster&#x27;s cabinet. Following Brewster&#x27;s death in 1918, Oliver succeeded him as premier.

In addition to his role as premier, Oliver held the portfolios of minister of Agriculture (1918), minister of Railways (1918–1922), and minister of industry (1919–1922). Under his leadership, his administration prioritized agricultural development, notably in the Okanagan Valley, which became a hub for the province&#x27;s produce industry. Oliver&#x27;s government also advocated for reduced rail freight rates to improve the economic viability of British Columbia’s agricultural exports.

A notable moment in Oliver&#x27;s tenure was the 1923 visit of U.S. president Warren G. Harding to Vancouver, marking the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Canada.

Oliver served as premier until his death in 1927. His legacy endures through numerous places named in his honor, including John Oliver Secondary School in Vancouver, John Oliver Park in Delta, Mount John Oliver in the Cariboo Mountains&#x27; Premier Range, the town of Oliver, British Columbia, and Oliver Street in Williams Lake, British Columbia.

<doc id="558959" wikidata="Q388201" url="?curid=558959" title="Railway electrification">
<text>Railway electrification is the use of electric power for the propulsion of rail transport. Electric railways use either electric locomotives (hauling passengers or freight in separate cars), electric multiple units (passenger cars with their own motors) or both.
Electricity is typically generated in large and relatively efficient generating stations, transmitted to the railway network and distributed to the trains. Some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and transmission lines, but most purchase power from an electric utility. The railway usually provides its own distribution lines, switches, and transformers.

Power is supplied to moving trains with a (nearly) continuous conductor running along the track that usually takes one of two forms: an overhead line, suspended from poles or towers along the track or from structure or tunnel ceilings and contacted by a pantograph, or a third rail mounted at track level and contacted by a sliding &quot;pickup shoe&quot;. Both overhead wire and third-rail systems usually use the running rails as the return conductor, but some systems use a separate fourth rail for this purpose.

In comparison to the principal alternative, the diesel engine, electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency, lower emissions, and lower operating costs. Electric locomotives are also usually quieter, more powerful, and more responsive and reliable than diesel. They have no local emissions, an important advantage in tunnels and urban areas. Some electric traction systems provide regenerative braking that turns the train&#x27;s kinetic energy back into electricity and returns it to the supply system to be used by other trains or the general utility grid. While diesel locomotives burn petroleum products, electricity can be generated from diverse sources, including renewable energy. Historically, concerns of resource independence have played a role in the decision to electrify railway lines. The landlocked Swiss confederation which almost completely lacks oil or coal deposits but has plentiful hydropower electrified its network in part in reaction to supply issues during both World Wars.

Disadvantages of electric traction include: high capital costs that may be uneconomic on lightly trafficked routes, a relative lack of flexibility (since electric trains need third rails or overhead wires), and a vulnerability to power interruptions. Electro-diesel locomotives and electro-diesel multiple units mitigate these problems somewhat as they are capable of running on diesel power during an outage or on non-electrified routes.

Different regions may use different supply voltages and frequencies, complicating through service and requiring greater complexity of locomotive power. There used to be a historical concern for double-stack rail transport regarding clearances with overhead lines but it is no longer universally true , with both Indian Railways and China Railway regularly operating electric double-stack cargo trains under overhead lines.

Railway electrification has constantly increased in the past decades, and as of 2022, electrified tracks account for nearly one-third of total tracks globally.

== History ==
Railway electrification is the development of powering trains and locomotives using electricity instead of diesel or steam power. The history of railway electrification dates back to the late 19th century when the first electric tramways were introduced in cities like Berlin, London, and New York City.

In 1881, the first permanent railway electrification in the world was the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway in Berlin, Germany. Overhead line electrification was first applied successfully by Frank Sprague in Richmond, Virginia in 1887-1888, and led to the electrification of hundreds of additional street railway systems by the early 1890s. The first electrification of a mainline railway was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Baltimore Belt Line in the United States in 1895–96.

The early electrification of railways used direct current (DC) power systems, which were limited in terms of the distance they could transmit power. However, in the early 20th century, alternating current (AC) power systems were developed, which allowed for more efficient power transmission over longer distances.

In the 1920s and 1930s, many countries worldwide began to electrify their railways. In Europe, Switzerland, Sweden, France, and Italy were among the early adopters of railway electrification. In the United States, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was one of the first major railways to be electrified.

Railway electrification continued to expand throughout the 20th century, with technological improvements and the development of high-speed trains and commuters. Today, many countries have extensive electrified railway networks with of standard lines in the world, including China, India, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Electrification is seen as a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel or steam power and is an important part of many countries&#x27; transportation infrastructure.

== Classification ==
Electrification systems are classified by three main parameters:
* Voltage
* Current
** Direct current (DC)
** Alternating current (AC)
*** Frequency
* Contact system
** Overhead lines (catenary)
** Third rail
** Fourth rail
** Ground-level power supply

Selection of an electrification system is based on economics of energy supply, maintenance, and capital cost compared to the revenue obtained for freight and passenger traffic. Different systems are used for urban and intercity areas; some electric locomotives can switch to different supply voltages to allow flexibility in operation.

=== Standardised voltages ===
Six of the most commonly used voltages have been selected for European and international standardisation. Some of these are independent of the contact system used, so that, for example, 750VDC may be used with either third rail or overhead lines.

There are many other voltage systems used for railway electrification systems around the world, and the list of railway electrification systems covers both standard voltage and non-standard voltage systems.

The permissible range of voltages allowed for the standardised voltages is as stated in standards BSEN50163 and IEC60850. These take into account the number of trains drawing current and their distance from the substation.

== Direct current ==

=== Overhead lines ===

1,500V DC is used in Japan, Indonesia, Hong Kong (parts), Ireland, Australia (parts), France (also using , the Netherlands, New Zealand (Wellington), Singapore (on the North East MRT line), the United States (Chicago area on the Metra Electric district and the South Shore Line interurban line and Link light rail in Seattle, Washington). In Slovakia, there are two narrow-gauge lines in the High Tatras (one a cog railway). In the Netherlands it is used on the main system, alongside 25kV on the HSL-Zuid and Betuwelijn, and 3,000V south of Maastricht. In Portugal, it is used in the Cascais Line and in Denmark on the suburban S-train system (1650V DC).

In the United Kingdom, 1,500VDC was used in 1954 for the Woodhead trans-Pennine route (now closed); the system used regenerative braking, allowing for transfer of energy between climbing and descending trains on the steep approaches to the tunnel. The system was also used for suburban electrification in East London and Manchester, now converted to 25kVAC. It is now only used for the Tyne and Wear Metro. In India, 1,500V DC was the first electrification system launched in 1925 in Mumbai area. Between 2012 and 2016, the electrification was converted to 25kV 50Hz, which is the countrywide system.

3kV DC is used in Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Chile, the northern portion of the Czech Republic, the former republics of the Soviet Union, and in the Netherlands on a few kilometers between Maastricht and Belgium. It was formerly used by the Milwaukee Road from Harlowton, Montana, to Seattle, across the Continental Divide and including extensive branch and loop lines in Montana, and by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (now New Jersey Transit, converted to 25kVAC) in the United States, and the Kolkata suburban railway (Bardhaman Main Line) in India, before it was converted to 25kV 50Hz.

DC voltages between 600V and 750V are used by most tramways and trolleybus networks, as well as some metro systems as the traction motors accept this voltage without the weight of an on-board transformer.

==== Medium-voltage DC ====
Increasing availability of high-voltage semiconductors may allow the use of higher and more efficient DC voltages that heretofore have only been practical with AC.

The use of medium-voltage DC electrification (MVDC) would solve some of the issues associated with standard-frequency AC electrification systems, especially possible supply grid load imbalance and the phase separation between the electrified sections powered from different phases, whereas high voltage would make the transmission more efficient. UIC conducted a case study for the conversion of the Bordeaux-Hendaye railway line (France), currently electrified at 1.5kV DC, to 9kV DC and found that the conversion would allow to use less bulky overhead wires (saving €20 million per 100route-km) and lower the losses (saving 2GWh per year per 100route-km; equalling about €150,000 p.a.). The line chosen is one of the lines, totalling 6000km, that are in need of renewal.

In the 1960s the Soviets experimented with boosting the overhead voltage from 3 to 6kV. DC rolling stock was equipped with ignitron-based converters to lower the supply voltage to 3kV. The converters turned out to be unreliable and the experiment was curtailed. In 1970 the Ural Electromechanical Institute of Railway Engineers carried out calculations for railway electrification
at , showing that the equivalent loss levels for a system could be achieved with DC voltage between 11 and 16kV. In the 1980s and 1990s was being tested on the October Railway near Leningrad (now Petersburg). The experiments ended in 1995 due to the end of funding.

=== Third rail ===
Most electrification systems use overhead wires, but third rail is an option up to 1,500V. Third rail systems almost exclusively use DC distribution. The use of AC is usually not feasible due to the dimensions of a third rail being physically very large compared with the skin depth that AC penetrates to in a steel rail. This effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of DC. Third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels, an important factor for subway systems.

=== Fourth rail ===

The London Underground in England is one of few networks that uses a four-rail system. The additional rail carries the electrical return that, on third-rail and overhead networks, is provided by the running rails. On the London Underground, a top-contact third rail is beside the track, energized at , and a top-contact fourth rail is located centrally between the running rails at , which combine to provide a traction voltage of . The same system was used for Milan&#x27;s earliest underground line, Milan Metro&#x27;s line 1, whose more recent lines use an overhead catenary or a third rail.

The key advantage of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London&#x27;s underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails, which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.

The Expo and Millennium Line of the Vancouver SkyTrain use side-contact fourth-rail systems for their supply. Both are located to the side of the train, as the space between the running rails is occupied by an aluminum plate, as part of stator of the linear induction propulsion system used on the Innovia ART system. While part of the SkyTrain network, the Canada Line does not use this system and instead uses more traditional motors attached to the wheels and third-rail electrification.

==== Rubber-tyred systems ====
A few lines of the Paris Métro in France operate on a four-rail power system. The trains move on rubber tyres which roll on a pair of narrow roll ways made of steel and, in some places, of concrete. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two guide bars provided outside the running &#x27;roll ways&#x27; become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide , so at least electrically it is a four-rail system. Each wheel set of a powered bogie carries one traction motor. A side sliding (side running) contact shoe picks up the current from the vertical face of each guide bar. The return of each traction motor, as well as each wagon, is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the running rails. This and all other rubber-tyred metros that have a track between the roll ways operate in the same manner.

== Alternating current ==
Railways and electrical utilities use AC as opposed to DC for the same reason: to use transformers, which require AC, to produce higher voltages.
The higher the voltage, the lower the current for the same power (because power is current multiplied by voltage), and power loss is proportional to the current squared. The lower current reduces line loss, thus allowing higher power to be delivered.

As alternating current is used with high voltages, inside the locomotive, a transformer steps the voltage down for use by the traction motors and auxiliary loads.

An early advantage of AC is that the power-wasting resistors used in DC locomotives for speed control were not needed in an AC locomotive: multiple taps on the transformer can supply a range of voltages.
Separate low-voltage transformer windings supply lighting and the motors driving auxiliary machinery.
More recently, the development of very high power semiconductors has caused the classic DC motor to be largely replaced with the three-phase induction motor fed by a variable frequency drive, a special inverter that varies both frequency and voltage to control motor speed.
These drives can run equally well on DC or AC of any frequency, and many modern electric locomotives are designed to handle different supply voltages and frequencies to simplify cross-border operation.

=== Low-frequency alternating current ===
Five European countries Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden have standardized on 15kV Hz (the 50Hz mains frequency divided by three) single-phase AC. On 16 October 1995, Germany, Austria and Switzerland changed from Hz to 16.7Hz which is no longer exactly one-third of the grid frequency. This solved overheating problems with the rotary converters used to generate some of this power from the grid supply.

In the US, the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Philadelphia and Reading Railway adopted 11kV 25Hz single-phase AC. Parts of the original electrified network still operate at 25Hz, with voltage boosted to 12kV, while others were converted to 12.5 or 25kV 60Hz.

In the UK, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway pioneered overhead electrification of its suburban lines in London, London Bridge to Victoria being opened to traffic on 1December 1909. Victoria to Crystal Palace via Balham and West Norwood opened in May 1911. Peckham Rye to West Norwood opened in June 1912. Further extensions were not made owing to the First World War. Two lines opened in 1925 under the Southern Railway serving Coulsdon North and Sutton railway station. The lines were electrified at 6.7kV 25Hz. It was announced in 1926 that all lines were to be converted to DC third rail and the last overhead-powered electric service ran in September 1929.

=== Standard frequency alternating current ===
AC power is used at 60Hz in North America (excluding the aforementioned 25Hz network), Saudi Arabia, western Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan; and at 50Hz in a number of European countries, India, eastern Japan, countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union, on high-speed lines in much of Western Europe (including countries that still run conventional railways under DC but not in countries using 16.7Hz, see above). Most systems like this operate at 25kV, although 12.5kV sections exist in the United States, and 20kV is used on some narrow-gauge lines in Japan. On &quot;French system&quot; HSLs, the overhead line and a &quot;sleeper&quot; feeder line each carry 25kV in relation to the rails, but in opposite phase so they are at 50kV from each other; autotransformers equalize the tension at regular intervals.

=== Three-phase alternating current ===
Various railway electrification systems in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries utilised three-phase, rather than single-phase electric power delivery due to ease of design of both power supply and locomotives. These systems could either use standard network frequency and three power cables, or reduced frequency, which allowed for return-phase line to be third rail, rather than an additional overhead wire.

== Comparisons ==

=== AC versus DC for mainlines ===
The majority of modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid that is delivered to a locomotive, and within the locomotive, transformed and rectified to a lower DC voltage in preparation for use by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be three-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to variable frequency three-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. The difference between AC and DC electrification systems lies in where the AC is converted to DC: at the substation or on the train. Energy efficiency and infrastructure costs determine which of these is used on a network, although this is often fixed due to pre-existing electrification systems.

Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. However, the higher voltages used in many AC electrification systems reduce transmission losses over longer distances, allowing for fewer substations or more powerful locomotives to be used. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.

Standard AC electrification systems use much higher voltages than standard DC systems. One of the advantages of raising the voltage is that, to transmit certain level of power, lower current is necessary (). Lowering the current reduces the ohmic losses and allows for less bulky, lighter overhead line equipment and more spacing between traction substations, while maintaining power capacity of the system. On the other hand, the higher voltage requires larger isolation gaps, requiring some elements of infrastructure to be larger. The standard-frequency AC system may introduce imbalance to the supply grid, requiring careful planning and design (as at each substation power is drawn from two out of three phases). The low-frequency AC system may be powered by separate generation and distribution network or a network of converter substations, adding the expense, also low-frequency transformers, used both at the substations and on the rolling stock, are particularly bulky and heavy. The DC system, apart from being limited as to the maximum power that can be transmitted, also can be responsible for electrochemical corrosion due to stray DC currents.

=== Electric versus diesel ===
==== Energy efficiency ====
Electric trains need not carry the weight of prime movers, transmission and fuel. This is partly offset by the weight of electrical equipment.
Regenerative braking returns power to the electrification system so that it may be used elsewhere, by other trains on the same system or returned to the general power grid. This is especially useful in mountainous areas where heavily loaded trains must descend long grades.

Central station electricity can often be generated with higher efficiency than a mobile engine/generator. While the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly the same in the nominal regime, diesel motors decrease in efficiency in non-nominal regimes at low power while if an electric power plant needs to generate less power it will shut down its least efficient generators, thereby increasing efficiency. The electric train can save energy (as compared to diesel) by regenerative braking and by not needing to consume energy by idling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coasting. However, electric rolling stock may run cooling blowers when stopped or coasting, thus consuming energy.

Large fossil fuel power stations operate at high efficiency, and can be used for district heating or to produce district cooling, leading to a higher total efficiency. Electricity for electric rail systems can also come from renewable energy, nuclear power, or other low-carbon sources, which do not emit pollution or emissions.

==== Power output ====
Electric locomotives may easily be constructed with greater power output than most diesel locomotives. For passenger operation it is possible to provide enough power with diesel engines (see e.g. &#x27;ICE TD&#x27;) but, at higher speeds, this proves costly and impractical. Therefore, almost all high speed trains are electric. The high power of electric locomotives also gives them the ability to pull freight at higher speed over gradients; in mixed traffic conditions this increases capacity when the time between trains can be decreased. The higher power of electric locomotives and an electrification can also be a cheaper alternative to a new and less steep railway if train weights are to be increased on a system.

On the other hand, electrification may not be suitable for lines with low frequency of traffic, because lower running cost of trains may be outweighed by the high cost of the electrification infrastructure. Therefore, most long-distance lines in developing or sparsely populated countries are not electrified due to relatively low frequency of trains.

==== Network effect ====
Network effects are a large factor with electrification. When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines. If through traffic is to have any benefit, time-consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive dual mode engines must be used. This is mostly an issue for long-distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic, which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car, also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.

A problem specifically related to electrified lines are gaps in the electrification. Electric vehicles, especially locomotives, lose power when traversing gaps in the supply, such as phase change gaps in overhead systems, and gaps over points in third rail systems. These become a nuisance if the locomotive stops with its collector on a dead gap, in which case there is no power to restart. This is less of a problem in trains consisting of two or more multiple units coupled together, since in that case if the train stops with one collector in a dead gap, another multiple unit can push or pull the disconnected unit until it can again draw power. The same applies to the kind of push-pull trains which have a locomotive at each end. Power gaps can be overcome in single-collector trains by on-board batteries or motor-flywheel-generator systems.
In 2014, progress is being made in the use of large capacitors to power electric vehicles between stations, and so avoid the need for overhead wires between those stations.

==== Maintenance costs ====
Maintenance costs of the lines may be increased by electrification, but many systems claim lower costs due to reduced wear-and-tear on the track from lighter rolling stock. There are some additional maintenance costs associated with the electrical equipment around the track, such as power sub-stations and the catenary wire itself, but, if there is sufficient traffic, the reduced track and especially the lower engine maintenance and running costs exceed the costs of this maintenance significantly.

==== Sparks effect ====
Newly electrified lines often show a &quot;sparks effect&quot;, whereby electrification in passenger rail systems leads to significant jumps in patronage / revenue. The reasons may include electric trains being seen as more modern and attractive to ride, faster, quieter and smoother service, and the fact that electrification often goes hand in hand with a general infrastructure and rolling stock overhaul / replacement, which leads to better service quality (in a way that theoretically could also be achieved by doing similar upgrades yet without electrification). Whatever the causes of the sparks effect, it is well established for numerous routes that have electrified over decades. This also applies when bus routes with diesel buses are replaced by trolleybuses. The overhead wires make the service &quot;visible&quot; even in no bus is running and the existence of the infrastructure gives some long-term expectations of the line being in operation.

==== Double-stack rail transport ====

Due to the height restriction imposed by the overhead wires, double-stacked container trains have been traditionally difficult and rare to operate under electrified lines. However, this limitation is being overcome by railways in India, China and African countries by laying new tracks with increased catenary height.

Such installations are in the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in India where the wire height is at to accommodate double-stack container trains without the need of well-wagons.

==== Advantages ====

There are a number of advantages including the fact there is no exposure of passengers to exhaust from the locomotive and lower cost of building, running and maintaining locomotives and multiple units. Electric trains have a higher power-to-weight ratio (no onboard fuel tanks), resulting in fewer locomotives, faster acceleration, higher practical limit of power, higher limit of speed, less noise pollution (quieter operation). The faster acceleration clears lines more quickly to run more trains on the track in urban rail uses.
* Reduced power loss at higher altitudes (for &quot;power loss&quot; see Diesel engine)
* Independence of running costs from fluctuating fuel prices
* Service to underground stations where diesel trains cannot operate for safety reasons
* Reduced environmental pollution, especially in highly populated urban areas, even if electricity is produced by fossil fuels
* Easily accommodates kinetic energy brake reclaim using supercapacitors
* More comfortable ride on multiple units as trains have no underfloor diesel engines
* Somewhat higher energy efficiency in part due to regenerative braking and less power lost when &quot;idling&quot;
* More flexible primary energy source: can use coal, natural gas, nuclear or renewable energy (hydro, solar, wind) as the primary energy source instead of diesel fuel
* If the entire network is electrified, diesel infrastructure such as fueling stations, maintenance yards and indeed the diesel locomotive fleet can be retired or put to other uses – this is often the business case in favor of electrifying the last few lines in a network where otherwise costs would be too high. Having only one type of motive power also allows greater fleet homogeneity which can also reduce costs.

==== Disadvantages ====
* Electrification cost: electrification requires an entire new infrastructure to be built around the existing tracks at a significant cost. Costs are especially high when tunnels, bridges and other obstructions have to be altered for clearance. Another aspect that can raise the cost of electrification are the alterations or upgrades to railway signalling needed for new traffic characteristics, and to protect signalling circuitry and track circuits from interference by traction current. Electrification typically requires line closures while new equipment is being installed.
* Appearance: the overhead line structures and cabling can have a significant landscape impact compared with a non-electrified or third rail electrified line that has only occasional signalling equipment above ground level.
* Fragility and vulnerability: overhead electrification systems can suffer severe disruption due to minor mechanical faults or the effects of high winds causing the pantograph of a moving train to become entangled with the catenary, ripping the wires from their supports. The damage is often not limited to the supply to one track, but extends to those for adjacent tracks as well, causing the entire route to be blocked for a considerable time. Third-rail systems can suffer disruption in cold weather due to ice forming on the conductor rail.
* Theft: the high scrap value of copper and the unguarded, remote installations make overhead cables an attractive target for scrap metal thieves. Attempts at theft of live 25kV cables may end in the thief&#x27;s death from electrocution. In the UK, cable theft is claimed to be one of the biggest sources of delay and disruption to train services – though this normally relates to signalling cable, which is equally problematic for diesel lines.
* Incompatibility: Diesel trains can run on any track without electricity or with any kind of electricity (third rail or overhead line, DC or AC, and at any voltage or frequency). Not so for electric trains, which can never run on non-electrified lines, and which even on electrified lines can run only on the single, or the few, electrical system(s) for which they are equipped. Even on fully electrified networks, it is usually a good idea to keep a few diesel locomotives for maintenance and repair trains, for instance to repair broken or stolen overhead lines, or to lay new tracks. However, due to ventilation issues, diesel trains may have to be banned from certain tunnels and underground train stations mitigating the advantage of diesel trains somewhat.
* Birds may perch on parts with different charges, and animals may also touch the electrification system. Dead animals attract foxes or other scavengers, bringing risk of collision with trains.
* In most of the world&#x27;s railway networks, the height clearance of overhead electrical lines is not sufficient for a double-stack container car or other unusually tall loads. To upgrade electrified lines to the correct clearances () to take double-stacked container trains, besides renewing bridges over it, would normally mean need for special pantographs violating standardisation and requiring custom made vehicles.

== Railway electrification around the world ==

As of 2012, electrified tracks accounted for nearly one third of total tracks globally.

As of 2018, there were of railways electrified at 25kV, either 50 or 60Hz; electrified at ; electrified at 15kV 16.7 or Hz and electrified at .

As of 2023, the Swiss rail network is the largest fully electrified network in the world and one of only eleven countries or territories to achieve this, as listed in List of countries by rail transport network size. The percentage then continues falling in order with Laos, Montenegro, India, Belgium, Georgia, South Korea, Netherlands, and Japan, with all others being less than 75% electrified. 
 Overall, China takes first place, with around of electrified railway, followed by India with over of electrified railway, and continuing with Russia, with over of electrified railway. A number of countries have zero electrified railways, instead relying on diesel multiple units, locomotive hauled services and many alternate forms of transport. The European Union contains the longest amount of electrified railways (in length), with over of electrified railway, however only making up around 55% of the total railway length.

Several countries have announced plans to electrify all or most of their railway network, including Indian Railways and Israel Railways.

The Trans-Siberian Railway mainly in Russia is completely electrified, making it one of the longest stretches of electrified railways in the world.

<text>Lester Bowie (October 11, 1941 – November 8, 1999) was an American jazz trumpet player and composer. He was a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and co-founded the Art Ensemble of Chicago.

==Biography==
Born in the historic village of Bartonsville in Frederick County, Maryland, United States, Bowie grew up in St Louis, Missouri. At the age of five, he started studying the trumpet with his father, a professional musician. He played with blues musicians such as Little Milton and Albert King, and rhythm and blues stars such as Solomon Burke, Joe Tex, and Rufus Thomas. In 1965, he became Fontella Bass&#x27;s musical director and husband. He was a co-founder of Black Artists Group (BAG) in St Louis.

In 1966, he moved to Chicago, where he worked as a studio musician, and met Muhal Richard Abrams and Roscoe Mitchell and became a member of the AACM. In 1968, he founded the Art Ensemble of Chicago with Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, and Malachi Favors. He remained a member of this group for the rest of his life, and was also a member of Jack DeJohnette&#x27;s New Directions quartet. He lived and worked in Jamaica and Nigeria, and played and recorded with Fela Kuti. Bowie&#x27;s onstage appearance, in a white lab coat, with his goatee waxed into two points, was an important part of the Art Ensemble&#x27;s stage show.

In 1984, he formed Lester Bowie&#x27;s Brass Fantasy, a brass nonet in which Bowie demonstrated jazz&#x27;s links to other forms of popular music, a decidedly more populist approach than that of the Art Ensemble. With this group he recorded songs previously associated with Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Marilyn Manson, along with other material. His New York Organ Ensemble featured James Carter and Amina Claudine Myers. In the mid-1980s, he was also part of the jazz supergroup The Leaders, which included tenor saxophonist Chico Freeman, alto saxophonist Arthur Blythe, drummer Famoudou Don Moye, pianist Kirk Lightsey, and bassist Cecil McBee. In 1991, Bowie recorded the opening theme for the eighth and final season of the television series &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

Although seen as part of the avant-garde, Bowie embraced techniques from the whole history of jazz trumpet, filling his music with humorous smears, blats, growls, half-valve effects, and so on. His affinity for reggae and ska is exemplified by his composition &quot;Ska Reggae Hi-Bop&quot;, which he performed with the Skatalites on their 1994 &quot;Hi-Bop Ska&quot;, and also with James Carter on &quot;Conversin&#x27; with the Elders&quot;. He also appeared on the 1994 Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, which was produced to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;.

In 1993, he played on the David Bowie album &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, including the song &quot;Looking for Lester&quot;, which was named after him. (Lester and David Bowie are not related—David Bowie&#x27;s birth name was David Jones.)

Bowie took an adventurous and humorous approach to music and criticized Wynton Marsalis for his conservative approach to jazz tradition. 

Bowie died of liver cancer in 1999 at his Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, New York house he shared with second wife Deborah for 20 years. The following year, he was inducted into the &quot;Down Beat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame. In 2001, the Art Ensemble of Chicago recorded &quot;Tribute to Lester&quot;. In 2020, Bowie was featured in a mural painted by Rafael Blanco in his hometown of Frederick, Maryland.

<doc id="558970" wikidata="Q174374" url="?curid=558970" title="The Secret of NIMH">
<text>The Secret of NIMH is a 1982 American animated fantasy adventure film directed by Don Bluth in his directorial debut and based on Robert C. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot;. It features an ensemble cast consisting of Elizabeth Hartman in her final film role as its protagonist, Mrs. Brisby, with Peter Strauss, Arthur Malet, Dom DeLuise, John Carradine, Derek Jacobi, Hermione Baddeley and Paul Shenar in supporting roles. It was produced by Bluth&#x27;s production company Don Bluth Productions in association with Aurora Productions.

&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; was released in the United States on July 2, 1982, by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. under the United Artists label. It was praised by critics, and won a Saturn Award for Best Animated Film of 1982. Though the film only made $14.7 million against a $7 million budget at the box office, it turned a solid profit through home video and overseas releases. It was followed in 1998 by a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue&quot;, which was made without Bluth&#x27;s involvement or input and met with poor reception.

In 2015, a live-action/animated remake was reported to be in the works. A television series adaptation was also revealed to be in development since 2021.

== Plot ==
Mrs. Brisby, a widowed field mouse, lives in a cinder block with her children on a farm owned by the Fitzgibbons family. She intends to move her family out of the field as plowing time approaches, but her son Timothy has fallen ill, putting it to a halt.

Brisby visits Mr. Ages, a friend of her late husband Jonathan, who diagnoses the illness as pneumonia, provides Brisby with medicine and warns her that Timothy must stay inside for at least three weeks to avoid death. On her way home, Brisby befriends Jeremy, a clumsy but friendly crow, before they both narrowly escape from the Fitzgibbons&#x27; family cat, Dragon. The next morning, Brisby discovers that the Fitzgibbons&#x27; patriarch and the farm&#x27;s owner has begun to plow early. Although her neighbor, Auntie Shrew, helps her disable his tractor, Brisby knows she must devise another plan. Jeremy takes her to meet the Great Owl, who tells her to visit a colony of rats that live beneath a rose bush on the farm and ask for the services of Nicodemus, their wise and mystical leader.

Brisby enters the rose bush and encounters an aggressive guard rat named Brutus, who chases her away. She is led back in by Ages and is amazed to see the rats&#x27; use of electricity and other technology. Brisby meets Justin, the friendly captain of the guard; Jenner, a ruthless and power-hungry member opposed to Nicodemus; and finally Nicodemus himself. From Nicodemus, she learns that many years ago the rats, along with her husband and Ages, were part of a series of experiments at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH for short). The experiments boosted their intelligence, as well as making them capable of speech, rationalization and abstract thought, thereby enabling them to escape, as well as extending their lifespans and slowing their aging processes. However, they are unable to live as typical rats would and need human technology to survive, which they have accomplished only by stealing, placing them at great risk of discovery. To avoid being at the mercy of humankind again, the rats have settled on a decision for them to leave the farm and live independently in an area they refer to as Thorn Valley. Nicodemus then gives Brisby a magical amulet that will activate when the wearer is courageous. Meanwhile, Jenner, who wishes for the rats to remain in the rose bush, plots with his reluctant accomplice, Sullivan, to eliminate Nicodemus.

Because of the rats&#x27; relationship with Jonathan, they agree to help her move her home. First, they need to drug Dragon so that it can be done without interference. Only Brisby can do this, as the rats cannot fit through the hole leading into the house; Jonathan was killed by Dragon in a previous attempt, while Ages broke his leg in another. That night, she puts the drug into Dragon&#x27;s dish, but the Fitzgibbons&#x27; son catches her. While trapped in a birdcage, she overhears a telephone conversation between the Fitzgibbons&#x27; patriarch and the staff of NIMH and learns that the institute intends to exterminate the rats in the morning. Brisby then escapes from the cage and runs off to warn them.

As a thunderstorm approaches, the rats begin moving the Brisby home, with the children and Auntie Shrew inside, using a rope and pulley system. Disregarding Sullivan&#x27;s protests, Jenner sabotages the assembly, causing it to fall apart and crush Nicodemus to death. Brisby soon arrives to warn the rats about NIMH&#x27;s arrival, but Jenner attacks her and attempts to steal the amulet as Sullivan alerts Justin, who comes to Brisby&#x27;s aid. Jenner fatally wounds Sullivan and engages Justin in a sword fight that ends with him being killed by the dying Sullivan.

The Brisby home suddenly begins to sink into the muddy ground it landed on and Brisby and the rats are unable to raise it. All appears lost until Brisby&#x27;s will to save her family gives power to the amulet, which she uses to lift the house and move it to safety. The next day, the rats, with Justin as their new leader, have departed for Thorn Valley as Timothy begins to recover. Jeremy then meets and falls in love with a female crow who is just as clumsy yet good-hearted as he is.

=== Background ===
The film rights to the book &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; had reportedly been offered to Walt Disney Productions in 1972, but they were turned down.

&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; was the first feature film to be directed by Don Bluth. On September 13, 1979, Bluth, fellow animators Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy and eight other animation staff left the feature animation department at Disney to set up their own independent studio, Don Bluth Productions. The studio worked, at first, out of Bluth&#x27;s house and garage, but moved to a two-story, facility in Studio City, California, several months later.

While they were still working at Disney, they produced the 27-minute short film &quot;Banjo the Woodpile Cat&quot; (1979) as a side project to gain other production skills that the company and their animation program were not addressing. Bluth asked Ron W. Miller, Walt Disney&#x27;s son-in-law and the president and CEO of the company at the time, to view &quot;Banjo&quot;, but Miller declined. As Goldman recalled, &quot;that pulled the enthusiasm rug out from under us. We had hoped that the studio might like what we were doing and agree to buy the film and allow us to finish the short film in the studio, which would allow us to recoup what we had spent in terms of money and the many hours that we and the other members of the team had invested in the film&quot;.

Before they started making &quot;Banjo&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; was read by artist and story writer Ken Anderson, who called it &quot;a wonderful story&quot;. He gave the book to Bluth for him to read and make a film out of after Bluth finished the animation direction of &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977). Bluth later showed the novel to Disney animation director Wolfgang Reitherman, who turned down Bluth&#x27;s offers to make a film based on the book, explaining that Disney has already a mouse named Mickey Mouse and they had recently made a similar film about mice named &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977). However, Bluth also presented the novel to the other staff that would work for Don Bluth Productions later on and they all loved it. Two months later, former Disney executive James L. Stewart, who now had started Aurora Productions, called Goldman and told him about Anderson&#x27;s idea of making a film based on &quot;NIMH&quot;. At Bluth, Goldman and Pomeroy&#x27;s request, Aurora Productions acquired the film rights and offered Don Bluth Productions a budget of US$5.7 million and 30 months to complete the film, tighter in both budget and schedule than most Disney animated features at the time.

=== Writing ===

One of the earliest drafts of the film was written by Steven Barnes, who received a creative consultant credit in the final product and was closer to the original novel. The story would have focused more on the rats and their time at NIMH as it did in the book, which was reduced to a short flashback in later revisions to bring Mrs. Brisby and her plight into the forefront. It also included (from the book) a female rat named Isabella (described as &quot;a young, cute, somewhat motor-mouthed rat with a crush on Justin&quot;), who was ultimately left out, with much of her dialogue given to Nicodemus. A revised synopsis dated July 2, 1980, by an unattributed author would take the film closer to its completed form, which ended with the mysterious disappearance of the rats, leading the characters and audience to wonder if they ever really existed, or were just an elaborate illusion.

Bluth himself would later make several changes to the story, most notably with the addition of mystical elements not present in the original novel. He explained that &quot;regarding magic, we really believe that animation calls for some magic, to give it a special &#x27;fantastic&#x27; quality&quot;. This was most apparent in the magic amulet given to Mrs. Brisby, which was meant to be a visual representation of her character&#x27;s internal power, something harder to show on film. The object was also meant to introduce a spiritual aspect to the plot, with the director remarking: &quot;The stone or amulet is just a method of letting the audience know that Mrs. Brisby has found &#x27;Courage of the Heart&#x27;. Magic? Maybe. Spiritual? Yes&quot;. In the same vein, Nicodemus was made into a wizard to &quot;create more mystery&quot; about himself and the rats&#x27; colony.

Among other changes, the antagonist Jenner was given much more prominence in the film, being only mentioned in the book as a traitor who leaves, to &quot;add drama&quot; to the narrative by giving it a more visible enemy. In the movie, Justin succeeds Nicodemus as the leader of the rats to give his character more of an arc and to allow him an opportunity to &quot;grow and change&quot;. Unlike the original work, Justin does not rescue Mrs. Brisby from the cage at the Fitzgibbons&#x27; house; instead, she helps her children without the rats&#x27; assistance by using the amulet, once again giving focus to her personal story. As Bluth put it, &quot;&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; is really a story about Mrs. Brisby and her need to save her children. If the rats save her children, then she hasn&#x27;t grown in the film&quot;.

During the film&#x27;s production, Aurora contacted Wham-O, the manufacturers of Frisbee flying discs, with concerns about possible trademark infringements if the &quot;Mrs. Frisby&quot; name in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s original book was used in the film. Wham-O rejected Aurora&#x27;s request for waiver to use the same-sounding name to their &quot;Frisbee&quot;, in the film. Aurora informed Bluth &amp; company that Mrs. Frisby&#x27;s name would have to be altered. By then, the voice work had already been recorded for the film, so the name change to &quot;Mrs. Brisby&quot; necessitated a combination of re-recording some lines and, because John Carradine was unavailable for further recordings, careful sound editing had to be performed, taking the &quot;B&quot; sound of another word from Carradine&#x27;s recorded lines, and replace the &quot;F&quot; sound with the &quot;B&quot; sound, altering the name from &quot;Frisby&quot; to &quot;Brisby&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Goldman described the casting process as &quot;exciting, fun, and sometimes strange&quot;. He stated that focusing on the characteristics of each character, the voices and acting abilities were crucial, saying that using voices that added to a film&#x27;s texture was part of the team&#x27;s philosophy in the development of a film. Goldman found the most memorable casting decision to be Dom DeLuise for Jeremy the Crow, which Goldman, Bluth, and Pomeroy all considered when they watched the 1978 film &quot;The End&quot; in their respective homes, independently of each other. Elizabeth Hartman was cast as Mrs. Brisby, with Goldman calling her performance in &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; &quot;so believable and sincere that we all felt that she was right for the part&quot;. Pomeroy suggested Derek Jacobi, who starred in the 1976 miniseries &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, to play the part of Nicodemus. Peter Strauss, whom the team previously saw in another miniseries from 1976, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, was cast as Justin. Paul Shenar was assigned to play Jenner since the staff liked his &quot;dark, powerful voice&quot;. Shakespearean actor John Carradine was &quot;perfect for the dark, ominous Great Owl&quot;, while Aldo Ray was assigned to voice Jenner&#x27;s reluctant accomplice, Sullivan, whom Goldman said &quot;also had a great distinctive voice&quot;.

=== Animation ===

The production of &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; lasted from January 1980 to early June 1982. The studio set out with the explicit goal in mind of returning feature animation to its &quot;golden era&quot;, concentrating on strong characters and story and experimenting with unusual and often more labor-intensive animation techniques. Bluth believed that older techniques were being abandoned in favor of lower production costs and that the only way that animation could survive was to continue traditional production methods.

Among the techniques experimented with on &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; were rotoscoping, multiple passes on the camera to achieve transparent shadows, backlit animation (where animated mattes are shot with light shining through color gels to produce glowing areas for artificial light and fire effects), and multiple color palettes for characters to fit in different lighting situations, from daylight, to night, to warm environments, to underwater. Mrs. Brisby had 46 different lighting situations; therefore there were 46 different color palettes, or lists of color, for her. Two modern, computerized versions of the multiplane camera were also manufactured for this production.

To achieve the film&#x27;s detailed full animation while keeping to the tight budget, the studio strove to maximize its use of time and resources. The crew often worked long hours with no immediate financial reward (though they were offered a cut of the film&#x27;s profits, a practice common for producers, directors and stars of live action films, but never before offered to artists on an animated feature). Producer Gary Goldman recalled working 110-hour weeks during the final six months of production. Around 100 in-house staff worked on the film, with the labor-intensive cel painting farmed out to 45 people working from home. Many minor roles, including incidental and crowd voice work, were filled in by the in-house staff. The final cost of the film was $6.385 million. The producers, Bluth, Goldman and Pomeroy and the executive producers at Aurora mortgaged their homes collectively for $700,000 to complete the film, with the understanding that their investment would be the first to be repaid. The film was the sixth animated feature to be presented in the Dolby Stereo sound system.

In animating Justin and Jenner&#x27;s sword fight, the animators referenced similar sequences in films such as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958).

== Music ==


&quot;The Secret of NIMH: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; contains songs from the film written by Jerry Goldsmith and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. One song, &quot;Flying Dreams&quot; was vocally performed by Paul Williams and Sally Stevens. It was Goldsmith&#x27;s first composition for an animated feature, which he admitted was such a departure from his normal work that in the end he approached the project like a live action score, employing the same kind of extended themes and structural development. What made the scoring process hard for Goldsmith was that he had to score scenes that were unfinished: &quot;I was on the phone constantly with them. My dupe [copy of the film] was in black and white, and they&#x27;d bring their color copy over so I could see it. They were constantly adding footage, and it was constantly, &#x27;What&#x27;s going on here?&#x27; and &#x27;What&#x27;s happening here?&#x27;&quot;

David M. Horton spent a year on the sound design for the film, which was supervised by Goldman. Goldman found the sound work by Horten his second favorite part of the production process, recalling that some of his &quot;most beautiful efforts&quot; had to make way for the recordings of Goldsmith&#x27;s music: &quot;I remember hearing David&#x27;s orchestration of ambient sounds and specific sound effects for the 8-minute tractor sequence without Jerry&#x27;s music cue. It was amazing. But then, so was Jerry&#x27;s 8-minute music cue, it remains extremely powerful. We were able to combine a lot of David&#x27;s sounds, treating them like part of the orchestra. It came out great, but I couldn&#x27;t help but feel empathy for David&quot;.

The album was released on July 2, 1982, on vinyl and a re-released reissue on March 3, 1995, on CD with a rearranged track listing. Intrada Records issued a remastered limited edition album on CD on August 17, 2015, with one previously unreleased cue (&quot;At Your Service&quot;, running 3:39) and three demos of &quot;Flying Dreams&quot; (as performed by Sally Stevens, Paul Williams and as a piano duet) totaling 10:09. Varese Sarabande did release the soundtrack on CD prior to the 1995 re-released reissue in 1986 with the artwork as the same as the LP jacket, but with a black background and a different track arrangement.

== Release ==
Tim Hildebrandt spent two weeks painting &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;&#x27;s promotional poster.

The film&#x27;s distributor, MGM/UA Entertainment Co., barely did any promotion for the film, leading Aurora to finance the advertising campaign themselves. The financiers had expected the film to open in wide release in 1,000 venues, but MGM opted for a limited opening weekend in 100 theaters, with its widest release in only 700. Although it faced competition with the blockbuster &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (directed by future Bluth partner Steven Spielberg), it performed better in those theaters alone in its opening week than &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, &quot;Rocky III&quot;, &quot;Firefox&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. &quot;NIMH&quot; grossed nearly $14.7 million in North America, though it was more successful on home video, cable, and foreign releases, ultimately turning a profit.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; debuted on Super 8 film and several home video formats in 1983, including VHS, Betamax, CED Videodisc, Video8 and LaserDisc, which were distributed by MGM/UA Home Video in North America and Warner Home Video in Europe, Australia and Japan. A Video 2000 version was also released exclusively in Europe. With a $79 purchase price in the United States, the VHS edition sold approximately 25,000 copies within the first few months.

On September 6, 1990, the film was re-released on both VHS and LaserDisc in a new advertising campaign with lower retail prices. It was this new wide availability on video, as well as broadcasts on cable, that helped &quot;NIMH&quot; garner a cult following long after its theatrical debut. This was followed by another VHS release under the MGM/UA Family Entertainment label in 1994, along with a Philips CD-i video disc version that same year, which was available exclusively through Warner Home Video worldwide.

The film was released on DVD for the first time on November 17, 1998, which was reprinted numerous times in the ensuing years, both as a stand-alone release or bundled with other animated films from MGM or 20th Century Fox. Don Bluth and Gary Goldman later oversaw a high-definition restoration of the film, which was released on June 19, 2007, in a 2-disc DVD set called the &quot;Family Fun Edition&quot;. Improvements in the transfer over the 1998 DVD include color correction and dirt and dust removal and included special features such as audio commentary from both individuals and an interview featurette. A Blu-ray version was released on March 29, 2011, which retained the special features of the &quot;Family Fun Edition&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; received positive reviews upon its release. It holds an approval rating of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; seeks to resurrect the classical style of American animation and succeeds, telling a mature story with rapturous presentation.&quot; The film also has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the movie two &quot;yes&quot; votes on a July 15, 1982, episode of their television program &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, stating that Don Bluth and his team had succeeded in their goal of matching the high-quality animation of Disney&#x27;s heyday while also incorporating a deeper plot and greater variety of settings than other recent animated films. In his print review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;an artistic success&quot;, praising the quality of its animation and saying that it &quot;contains that absolute rarity among feature-length animated cartoons, an interesting premise&quot;. 

Ebert found that &quot;NIMH&quot; may not resonate as well on an emotional level with younger viewers, since &quot;it has so many characters and involves them in so many different problems that there&#x27;s nobody for the kids in the audience to strongly identify with&quot;. Siskel, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, found the film &quot;charming&quot; but stated that the narrative was &quot;littered with too many unimportant characters&quot; and that Dom DeLuise &quot;insert[ed] too much of himself&quot; into the character of Jeremy. Despite this, Siskel found the film, particularly the second half, to be a &quot;genuine pleasure&quot; and felt that even adults will be drawn into the story by the end, giving it three stars out of four.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the film&#x27;s animation was &quot;something of a technical and stylistic triumph&quot; comparable to that of Disney&#x27;s golden age, but he expressed dismay at the narrative, finding it too complicated and lacking in an &quot;easily identifiable central character&quot;. In his review for the 1990 VHS re-release, Jeff Unger of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; an A grade, calling it &quot;a wonderful adaptation&quot; of the original book, adding that &quot;Bluth and his animators, bless them, chose to revive an endangered art form – classically detailed animation. They drew their characters exquisitely and gave them individual personalities. The entire ensemble – artists, actors, animals, and musicians – created something unique: the world&#x27;s first enjoyable rat race.&quot; Similarly, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;something gorgeous to look at&quot;.
=== Accolades ===
&quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; won Best Animated Film of 1982 at the 10th annual Saturn Awards, where it also received a nomination for Best Fantasy Film, losing to &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. In his acceptance speech, Bluth remarked: &quot;Thanks. We didn&#x27;t think anyone had noticed&quot;. The film was also nominated for Best Family Feature for Animation, Musical or Fantasy at the 4th annual Youth in Film Awards, being beaten by &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, while the home video release received an Award of Excellence from the Film Advisory Board. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list.

== Sequel ==

A direct-to-video sequel directed by Dick Sebast and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation titled &quot;The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue&quot; was released on December 22, 1998. Set several years after the events of the first film, the plot focuses on Mrs. Brisby&#x27;s son Timothy as he struggles to live up to his father&#x27;s prestigious reputation. Apart from Dom DeLuise and Arthur Malet reprising their roles as Jeremy and Mr. Ages, respectively, none of the original voice cast returned for the film. The film was made without Don Bluth&#x27;s input or involvement and was panned by critics and fans upon release.

== Live-action remake and television series ==
In 2009, Paramount Pictures was working with Neil Burger on a remake of &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;; nothing has materialized since.

In 2015, MGM re-acquired the rights to produce a new film based on the original novel &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot;. The film was to be produced by the team of Daniel Bobker and Ehren Kruger, with screenplay by &quot;Ice Age&quot; series writer Michael Berg. The film was to be James Madigan&#x27;s directorial debut. Planned as a CGI/live-action hybrid in the style of films like &quot;The Smurfs&quot; and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, the film was to be &quot;an origin story in which an imperiled mouse protagonist befriends a comical crew of lab rats as they turn hyper-intelligent. They escape a secret laboratory and become the great minds of vermin civilization, forced to outwit the humans hot on their tails&quot;. The studio planned to turn the novel into a family franchise.

The Russo brothers were attached as executive producers of the remake as of April 2019.

A television series based on the books was in development at Fox as an event series in September 2021.

<text>GQ (short for Gentlemen&#x27;s Quarterly and previously known as Apparel Arts) is an international monthly men&#x27;s magazine based in New York City and founded in 1931. The publication focuses on fashion, style, and culture for men, though articles on food, movies, fitness, sex, music, travel, celebrities&#x27; sports, technology, and books are also featured.

== History ==
The magazine &quot;Apparel Arts&quot; was launched in 1931 in the United States as a men&#x27;s fashion magazine for the clothing trade, aimed primarily at wholesale buyers and retail sellers. Initially it had a very limited print run and was aimed solely at industry insiders to enable them to advise their customers. The popularity of the magazine among retail customers, who often took the magazine from the retailers, spurred the creation of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 1933.

&quot;Apparel Arts&quot; continued until 1957 when it was transformed into a quarterly magazine for men, which was published for many years by Esquire Inc. Apparel was dropped from the logo in 1958 with the spring issue after nine issues, and the name &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; was established.

&quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; was re-branded as &quot;GQ&quot; in 1967. The rate of publication was increased from quarterly to monthly in 1970. In 1979 Condé Nast bought the publication, and editor Art Cooper changed the course of the magazine, introducing articles beyond fashion and establishing &quot;GQ&quot; as a general men&#x27;s magazine in competition with &quot;Esquire&quot;. 

Nonnie Moore was hired by &quot;GQ&quot; as fashion editor in 1984, having served in the same position at &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Jim Moore, the magazine&#x27;s fashion director at the time of her death in 2009, described the choice as unusual, observing that &quot;She was not from men&#x27;s wear, so people said she was an odd choice, but she was actually the perfect choice&quot;. Jim Moore also noted that she changed the publication&#x27;s more casual look: &quot;She helped dress up the pages, as well as dress up the men, while making the mix more exciting and varied and approachable for men.&quot;

&quot;GQ&quot; has been closely associated with metrosexuality. The writer Mark Simpson coined the term in an article for British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; about his visit to a &quot;GQ&quot; exhibition in London: &quot;The promotion of metrosexuality was left to the men&#x27;s style press, magazines such as &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;, the new media which took off in the Eighties and is still growing ... They filled their magazines with images of narcissistic young men sporting fashionable clothes and accessories. And they induced other young men to study them with a mixture of envy and desire.&quot; The magazine has expanded its coverage beyond lifestyle issues. &quot;GQ&quot; has been called the &quot;holy text of woke capital&quot; by &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;GQ&quot; launched the spinoff quarterly &quot;GQ Style,&quot; headed by then-style editor Will Welch, who was later promoted to creative director of the magazine.

In 2018, writing for &quot;GQ&quot;, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for her article about Dylann Roof, who had shot nine African-Americans in a church in Charleston. In September 2018, Will Welch was named the new editor-in-chief of GQ, succeeding Jim Nelson.

In 2020, GQ launched its webstore and first merch drop. The GQ Shop lineup was designed by the editors and art directors behind the GQ website.

== Men of the Year ==
&quot;GQ&quot; (U.S.) first named their Men of the Year in 1996 and featured the award recipients in a special issue of the magazine. British &quot;GQ&quot; launched its annual Men of the Year awards in 2009 and &quot;GQ&quot; India launched its version the following year. Spanish and Brazilian &quot;GQ&quot; launched their Men of the Year awards in 2011 and &quot;GQ&quot; Australia launched its version in 2007.

== Controversies ==

=== &quot;Glee&quot; controversy ===
In 2010, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine had three adult members of the television show &quot;Glee&quot; (Dianna Agron, Lea Michele and Cory Monteith) partake in a photoshoot. The sexualization of the actresses in the photos caused controversy among parents of teens who watch the show &quot;Glee&quot;. The Parents Television Council was the first to react to the photo spread when it was leaked prior to &quot;GQ&quot;″s planned publishing date. Their president Tim Winter stated, &quot;By authorizing this kind of near-pornographic display, the creators of the program have established their intentions on the show&#x27;s directions. And it isn&#x27;t good for families&quot;. The photoshoot was published as planned and Dianna Agron went on to state that the photos did push the envelope, that they did not represent who she is, any more than other magazine photo shoots, but that she was a 24-year-old adult in the photo shoot, and wondered why the concerned parents allowed their eight year old daughters to read any racy issue of the adult magazine &quot;GQ&quot;.

=== Russian apartment bombings ===
&quot;GQ&quot;″s September 2009 U.S. magazine published, in its &quot;backstory&quot; section, an article by Scott Anderson, &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot;. Before &quot;GQ&quot; published the article, an internal email from a Condé Nast lawyer referred to it as &quot;Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Dark Rise to Power&quot;. The article reported Anderson&#x27;s investigation of the 1999 Russian apartment bombings, and included interviews with Mikhail Trepashkin who investigated the bombings while he was a colonel in Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service.

The story, including Trepashkin&#x27;s own findings, contradicted the Russian Government&#x27;s official explanation of the bombings and criticized Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia.

Condé Nast&#x27;s management tried to keep the story out of Russia. It ordered executives and editors not to distribute that issue in Russia or show it to &quot;Russian government officials, journalists or advertisers&quot;. Management decided not to publish the story on &quot;GQ&quot;″s website or in Condé Nast&#x27;s foreign magazines, not to publicize the story, and asked Anderson not to syndicate the story &quot;to any publications that appear in Russia&quot;.

The day after the magazine&#x27;s publication in the United States, bloggers published the original English text and a translation into Russian on the internet.

=== Criticism of the Bible and Western literary canon ===

On April 19, 2018, the editors of &quot;GQ&quot; published an article titled &quot;21 Books You Don&#x27;t Have to Read&quot; in which the editors compiled a list of works they think are overrated and should be passed over, including the Bible as well as &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;Catch-22&quot;. The article generated a backlash among Internet commentators.

=== Karol G&#x27;s photo retouching ===
On April 6, 2023, the Colombian singer Karol G took to social media to share that the photo used on the cover of an issue of GQ Mexico was &quot;disrespectful&quot; and a misleading depiction of the way her body and face naturally looks. She wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to start this message. Today my GQ magazine cover was made public, a cover with an image that does not represent me. My face doesn&#x27;t look like that, my body doesn&#x27;t look like that and I feel very happy and comfortable with how I look naturally.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s disrespectful to me. It&#x27;s to the women that every day we wake up looking to feel comfortable with ourselves despite society&#x27;s stereotypes.&quot;

== Circulation ==
The magazine reported an average worldwide paid circulation of 934,000 in the first half of 2019, down 1.1% from 944,549 in 2016 and 2.6% from 958,926 in 2015.

According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK), &quot;British GQ&quot; had an average circulation of 103,087 during the first half of 2019, down 6.3% from 110,063 during the second half of 2018, and down 10.3% from 114,867 during the second half of 2013.

<doc id="558976" wikidata="Q2069673" url="?curid=558976" title="Tien Shinhan">
<text>, known as Tenshinhan in Japanese media and Viz Media&#x27;s release of the manga, is a fictional character in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise created by Akira Toriyama. He made his appearance in chapter #113 &quot;The 22nd Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, first published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on February 24, 1987, entering the World Martial Arts Tournament to defeat Son Goku and his fellow-students. However, he later teams up with them to defeat King Piccolo, accompanied by his best friend Chiaotzu. Tien becomes Goku&#x27;s rival for a period and is notable for being the first person in the series to fly using and to use the technique.

The character of Tien has received praise from reviewers of manga and anime. They praised his quest for redemption in the King Piccolo arc and his fights have been celebrated as dramatic, intense, and entertaining. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing his likeness including action figures, key chains, and capsule toys.

==Design==
The character&#x27;s is named after &quot;tenshindon&quot;, a chūka dish consisting of a crabmeat omelet over rice. Toriyama said that although Tien is strong and cool, he based his name on a well-known Chinese food just to be &quot;silly.&quot;
Tien is loosely based on Erlang Shen from Journey to the West, a three-eyed taoist deity who first appears as an adversary of Sun Wukong, later becoming his ally and rival.

==Abilities==
Tien Shinhan is one of the strongest humans on Earth in the series. Through training with Master Shen, he became superhuman, gaining super strength, speed, agility, reflexes, the ability to fly, with telepathy, telekinesis, generate energy from his very being called ki, produce energy blasts, absorb energy and energy blasts, control as well as sense energy around him and enhance his abilities by increasing his energy through force of will.

==Voice actors==
Tien was voiced by Hirotaka Suzuoki in most media, with the exception of episodes 82 and 84 of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, where he is voiced by Kōichi Yamadera. Suzuoki said that despite joining the cast while the show had already been in production for a while, it was easy for him to relax and find his place. After Suzuoki&#x27;s death in 2006, Mitsuaki Madono voiced Tien in several video games such as &quot;Burst Limit&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Adventure&quot;, before Hikaru Midorikawa took over the role for &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot; and all media since.

In the Funimation dub of the series, Tien is voiced by Chris Cason and John Burgmeier.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;===
Tien is introduced as the star pupil of Master Roshi&#x27;s rival, , who has him and Chiaotzu enter the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; to prove his students&#x27; superiority. He begins as an arrogant, but talented martial artist, antagonizing Goku, Krillin, and especially Yamcha. He first fights Yamcha in the tournament, whose leg he ruthlessly breaks to win. Upon learning that Goku killed Tao Pai Pai, the younger brother of Master Shen and a mentor of Tien&#x27;s, he decides to kill Goku in revenge. He fights Master Roshi (disguised as Jackie Chun) in his next match, and Roshi shakes his resolve to kill Goku. In the final fight, he battles Goku and brutally beats him down early in the fight, before Goku uses his full power, making the fight more even. Chiaotzu interferes with the fight by using his psychic powers to paralyze Goku without Tien&#x27;s knowledge or consent, but once Tien realizes that Chiaotzu is cheating, he defies his master and refuses to kill Goku. Tien wins the tournament after destroying the stage with the powerful but potentially life-threatening &quot;Kikōhō&quot;, and after abandoning Master Shen with Chiaotzu. Launch falls in love with him and asks him to live at Kame House with her and Roshi, but Tien refuses, saying that he does not want to live with the rival of his former master.

After the death of Krillin at the hands of King Piccolo, Tien and Chiaotzu offer to help Roshi in the search for the Dragon Balls. But when Chiaotzu and Roshi are both killed and Piccolo wishes for his youth, he learns the suicidal &quot;Mafūba&quot; technique in order to seal away King Piccolo. After Piccolo chooses to attack West City, Tien intercepts him despite knowing that he cannot be revived by the Dragon Balls, but must defeat Piccolo&#x27;s strongest son Drum first, having to be rescued by Goku. In the final battle against King Piccolo, Tien uses the last of his energy to save Goku from Piccolo&#x27;s strongest attack, but is then taken hostage by Piccolo as he cripples Goku. After Goku kills Piccolo, he is taken by Yajirobe to be healed at Korin Tower, while Tien reunites with Bulma, Yamcha, and Launch, the latter of which nurses him back to health. Tien participates in the next &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, where he fights the previously assumed dead Tao Pai Pai, who had been saved by cybernetics and wants revenge on both Tien, for turning his back on him and his brother, and Goku. Tien easily outmatches Tao Pai Pai, but does not want to humiliate his former master and tries to drag him out of the ring peacefully. Tao Pai Pai catches Tien by surprise and gives him a scar across his chest, which he retains for the rest of the series, before Tien defeats him with a single punch. Tien then fights Goku again in the semi-finals, is defeated, and later protects their allies from being caught up in Piccolo Jr.&#x27;s attacks during the final fight.

Tien prepares for training along with the other heroes at Kami&#x27;s in order to fight the invading Saiyans. Tien manages to defeat a Saibaman, but when Chiaotzu sacrifices his life in a failed attempt to kill Nappa, he knowingly uses the last of his power attempting to kill Nappa, but fails. Along with Yamcha, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo, he goes to King Kai&#x27;s planet to train under him in the afterlife. He is revived by the Dragon Balls and prepares to fight against the returning Frieza, before Future Trunks appears and beats them to it. He trains for the battle against the Androids, but does not bring Chiaotzu as he believes that he is not strong enough. He accompanies Piccolo and Goku to fight Android 20 and Android 19. He searches for Doctor Gero&#x27;s hideout. After Androids 17 and 18 are released, he tries to fight them with Vegeta, Piccolo, and Trunks, but they are all defeated. He saves Android 18 and Android 16 from being absorbed by Cell and gives them time to escape by continuously attacking Cell (who had just easily defeated Piccolo and Android 16), expending all his energy and having to be rescued by Goku. He then participates in the battle against the Cell Jr.s. When Goku returns from the afterlife and asks where Tien is, Krillin says that he is not coming. However, after Majin Buu is released, Tien appears and saves, Gohan, Dende, and Mr. Satan from being killed by Buu. He fights Buu, but is unable to damage him, and is defeated by a single kick. He and Chiaotzu later contributed their energy for Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki Dama&quot; attack to defeat Buu once and for all.

In a filler episode of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, during the Saiyan arc, Tien trains for the Saiyans by fighting members of their race in the past using the Pendulum Room.

===In &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;===
In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, Tien, Android 18 and Piccolo attack Beerus after Buu angers him, the three being defeated; and in &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot;, Tien assists in the battle against the resurrected Frieza and his henchmen, being saved from death by Whis. The events of &quot;Battle of Gods&quot; and &quot;Resurrection &#x27;F&quot;&#x27; have been adapted as the first two story arcs for the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; anime, with Tien&#x27;s role in the &quot;Super&quot; retelling of the story arcs relatively unchanged.

After these two events and beyond, Goku decides to recruit Tien for the Tournament of Power team for Universe 7, and learns that he and Chiaotzu have formed a martial arts dojo. Tien initially turns down Goku&#x27;s request and works with Goku, Chiaotzu, and Master Roshi to reverse the brainwashing of his students by Yurin, a woman that Tien used to be classmates with during his time at Crane School who had sworn revenge on him after he left and declined to fight with her. After Yurin brainwashes Master Roshi, the latter defeats Tien, who agrees to join the Tournament of Power as he believes the ten million Zeni falsely promised by Goku will help repair the village. Tien agrees to participate in a fight against Gohan and Piccolo with Goku, calling off the match after Piccolo destroys the mountain fighting stage. Tien is part of the group that adheres to Gohan&#x27;s plan of remaining together and later fights Universe 2&#x27;s Harmira, using his multiplication technique to give himself time against Harmira. Three of Tien&#x27;s four clones are defeated by Harmira, who shoots the ground from underneath Tien to knock him off stage and is grabbed by Tien&#x27;s three other clones, eliminating them both from the tournament.

=== In other media ===
Tien appears in two non-canon &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; movies; in the third, Tien battles the henchmen of Turles; in the ninth, Tien is involved with an intergalactic tournament and helps Gohan with Bojack&#x27;s minions.

He makes very brief appearances in &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, the anime-only sequel to the series.

Tien appears in most &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; games. In the 2003 game &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2&quot;, Tien and Yamcha can be absorbed by Majin Buu to create a form exclusive to the game. In the 2009 game &quot;Dragon Ball: Raging Blast&quot;, Chiaotzu is told by Burter and Jeice that he drags Tien down, the latter arriving during Chiaotzu&#x27;s fight with the pair and defeating them both, Tien afterward asserting that the duo&#x27;s claim was false. The two are subsequently challenged by Goten and Trunks, who fuse into Gotenks, and Goku and Vegeta, defeating both pairs to assert themselves as the best tag team. In the 2018 game &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot;, Tien is guarded by Chiaotzu while the two are approached by clones until Goku and Krillin arrive. After Krillin explains the situation, Tien states his intent to fight alongside them against the clones and agrees to Chiaotzu&#x27;s help on the condition that he does not leave his side. After Android 21 follows the heroes to the Kaioshin planet, Tien uses the Neo Tri-Beam to aid in destroying her.

He is referenced by American rapper Soulja Boy in the uncut version of his song &quot;Goku&quot;, where he states that he &quot;feels like Tien&quot; along with other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters and Pikachu.

==Reception==
Tien is a popular character in the series, in 2004 fans of the series voted him the sixteenth most popular character for the book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. Tien&#x27;s voice actor for the original broadcast, Hirotaka Suzuoki, said despite the character not being an ordinary human, the character&#x27;s interactions with Chiaotzu showed his humanity. Tien has received both praise and criticism from numerous publications. Theron Martin of Anime News Network stated that it was &#x27;fun&#x27; seeing the groundwork for Tien being laid and reflecting on how he later changed. Martin went on to say that Goku&#x27;s fight with Tien &quot;presents the most dramatic and intense duel to date in the series.&quot; Davey C. Jones of Active Anime noted that &quot;Tien&#x27;s redemption made an interesting side story&quot; and that it was &quot;crucial in the final episodes&quot; of the King Piccolo arc.

Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment commented on episodes 62-92 of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, saying, &quot;there are some dull moments to be had, especially as I don&#x27;t find Tien or Chaozu to be interesting characters.&quot; However he went on to say that Tien&#x27;s fight with Goku &quot;was really quite good&quot; and expressed mixed feelings about the character, saying that as a villain &quot;he was fairly one dimensional.&quot; But after being influenced by Master Roshi&#x27;s teachings Beveridge said, he &quot;becomes a much more interesting character&quot; and was disappointed that he did not have a really &quot;strong story told for him after this series.&quot; Sean Connolly of the same site said that Tien &quot;shows his worth&quot; by holding off Cell &quot;with a flurry of high powered attacks.&quot; ANN&#x27;s D.F. Smith said that Tien&#x27;s fight against King Piccolo&#x27;s minions was entertaining, but the conclusion of his fight against Goku was random.

<text>Tadoussac () is a village municipality in La Haute-Côte-Nord RCM (Regional County Municipality), on the north shore of the maritime section of the estuary of St. Lawrence river, in Côte-Nord region, Quebec, Canada.

== Geography ==
Tadoussac is located in a bay on the north shore of the lower estuary of the St. Lawrence River, at the mouth of the Saguenay River fjord. Tadoussac offers a backdrop of mountains, water, rock and greenery. The village municipality is a point of convergence between the Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Charlevoix.
The entire area is either rural or still in a wilderness state, with several federal and provincial natural parks and preserves nearby which protect natural resources. Tadoussac encompasses the first marine national park of Canada. The nearest urban agglomeration is Saguenay about west.

== History ==

Jacques Cartier came to the site in 1535 during his second voyage. He found Innu people using it as a base for hunting seal. Later that same century, Basques conducted whaling expeditions on the river, as well as engaging in hides trade with the natives based in the shore at the mouth of the Saguenay.

Tadoussac was founded in 1599 by François Gravé Du Pont, a merchant, and Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit, a captain of the French Royal Navy, when they acquired a fur trade monopoly from King Henry IV. Gravé and Chauvin built the settlement on the shore at the mouth of the Saguenay River, at its confluence with the St. Lawrence, to profit from its location. But the frontier was harsh and only five of the initial sixteen settlers survived the first winter. In 1603, the tabagie or &quot;feast&quot; of Tadoussac reunited Gravé with Samuel de Champlain and with the Montagnais, the Algonquins, and the Etchimins.&quot; In 1615, the Mission of L&#x27;Exaltation-de-la-Sainte-Croix-de-Tadoussac, named in memory of a cross planted by Jean de Quen, was founded by the Récollet Order. Their missionary brothers sang the first Mass there two years later.

Tadoussac remained the only seaport on the St. Lawrence River for 30 years. Colonists from the Tadoussac area were involved in whaling from 1632 until at least the end of the century.

Historians believe the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, who inhabited the St. Lawrence valley upriver to the west, were defeated and pushed out by the Mohawk before the early 17th century. By the late 17th and early 18th century, Tadoussac was the centre of fur trade between the French and First Nations peoples. Competition over the fur trade increased among the nations. In 1720, the trading post became part of the King&#x27;s Domain Posts. Between 1762 and 1786, it was operated by Dunn, Gray and Murray.

In 1802, the North West Company obtained the lease on the trading posts in the King&#x27;s Domain. When the North West Company (NWC) and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) merged in 1821, it was operated by the HBC for one year until the original NWC lease expired. The renewal of the 20-year lease was awarded to John Goudie, the highest bidder, but in 1831, the HBC reacquired the King&#x27;s Posts by buying the lease from William Lampson. The Tadoussac post (also called Totoushack) was the administrative headquarters for all the King&#x27;s Posts until 1849, when the headquarters were relocated to Ile Jérémie. Due to a decline in the fur trade, Tadoussac became just a summer fishing post in 1851. In 1859, the HBC sold the salmon fishery, including its ice house and store, and ceased operations in Tadoussac.

In the 19th century, with industrialization reaching other parts of Canada, tourists discovered the appeal of this rural village. Wealthy Québécois built a number of vacation villas. A Victorian hotel called the Hotel Tadoussac was built in 1864; it was expanded around 1900 and demolished in 1942, and replaced by a newer Hotel Tadoussac.

In 1855, the geographic township of Tadoussac was established. In 1899, it was incorporated as a village municipality. In 1937, the Parish Municipality of Tadoussac was formed, but dissolved in 1949 because it had less than 500 inhabitants.

=== Contemporary ===
The modern village of Tadoussac lies close to the site of the original settlement at the mouth of the Saguenay River. It is known as a tourist destination because of the rugged beauty of the Saguenay fjord and its facilities for whale watching. The authority for the Port of Tadoussac was transferred in April 2012 to the Municipality of Tadoussac.

== Demographics ==

<doc id="558983" wikidata="Q164652" url="?curid=558983" title="Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 10 in E minor, Op. 93, by Dmitri Shostakovich was premiered by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky on 17 December 1953. It is not clear when it was written. According to the composer, the symphony was composed between July and October 1953, but Tatiana Nikolayeva stated that it was completed in 1951. Sketches for some of the material date from 1946.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes (first flute with B foot extension, second flute doubling piccolo), three oboes (third doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (third doubling E-flat clarinet), three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, snare drum, triangle, cymbals, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, and strings.

==Composition==

The symphony has four movements and a duration of approximately 50-60 minutes:
=== I. Moderato ===
The first and longest movement is a slow movement in rough sonata form. As in his Fifth Symphony, Shostakovich alludes to one of his settings of Pushkin: in the first movement, from the second of his &quot;Four Monologues on Verses by Pushkin&quot;, entitled &quot;What Does My Name Mean to You?&quot;.

=== II. Allegro ===
The second movement is a short and loud scherzo with syncopated rhythms and semiquaver (sixteenth note) passages. The book &quot;Testimony&quot; said:

I did depict Stalin in my next symphony, the Tenth. I wrote it right after Stalin&#x27;s death and no one has yet guessed what the symphony is about. It&#x27;s about Stalin and the Stalin years. The second part, the scherzo, is a musical portrait of Stalin, roughly speaking. Of course, there are many other things in it, but that&#x27;s the basis.

Shostakovich biographer Laurel Fay wrote, &quot;I have found no corroboration that such a specific program was either intended or perceived at the time of composition and first performance.&quot; Musicologist Richard Taruskin called the proposition a &quot;dubious revelation, which no one had previously suspected either in Russia or in the West&quot;. Elizabeth Wilson adds: &quot;The Tenth Symphony is often read as the composer’s commentary on the recent Stalinist era. But as so often in Shostakovich’s art, the exposition of external events is counter-opposed to the private world of his innermost feelings.&quot;

=== III. Allegretto ===
The third movement is built around two musical codes: the DSCH theme representing Shostakovich, and the Elmira theme ():

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \once \omit Score.MetronomeMark \tempo 4 = 120
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot;
 \key c \major
 \time 3/4
 e2. ~e2. a2. e2. ~e4 d2 a&#x27;2. ~a2. ~a8 r8 r4 r4
&lt;/score&gt;
At concert pitch one fifth lower, the notes spell out &quot;E La Mi Re A&quot; in a combination of French and German notation. This motif, called out twelve times on the horn, represents , a student of the composer with whom he fell in love. The motif is of ambiguous tonality, giving it an air of uncertainty or hollowness.

In a letter to Nazirova, Shostakovich himself noted the similarity of the motif to the ape call in the first movement of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, a work which he had been listening to around that time: ()
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \once \omit Score.MetronomeMark \tempo 2. = 66
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot;
 \key c \major
 \time 3/4
 \partial8 e8 a2. e4. \autoBeamOff d8 \autoBeamOn e a e2.
&lt;/score&gt;
The same notes are used in both motifs, and both are repeatedly played by the horn. In the Chinese poem set by Mahler, the ape is a representation of death, while the Elmira motif itself occurs together with the &quot;funeral knell&quot; of a tam tam. Over the course of the movement, the DSCH and Elmira themes alternate and gradually draw closer.

=== IV. Andante, Allegro ===
In the fourth and final movement, a slow &quot;Andante&quot; introduction segues abruptly into an &quot;Allegro&quot; wherein the DSCH theme is employed again. The coda effects a transition to E Major and, at in the final measures, several instruments glissando from an E to the next E.

The DSCH-motif is anticipated throughout the first movement of the 10th Symphony: In the 7th bar of the start of the symphony the violins doubled by the violas play a D for 5 bars which is then directly followed by an E; 9 bars before rehearsal mark 29 the violins play the motif in an inverted order D-C-H-S (or D-C-B-E).

<doc id="558984" wikidata="Q3400611" url="?curid=558984" title="Wick, Vale of Glamorgan">
<text>Wick () is a small village and community in the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales, situated approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the coast. The closest towns are Llantwit Major, Cowbridge and Bridgend. The community includes Broughton.

== Amenities ==
The village has two pubs, a village shop and a primary school. There are several footpaths and bridleways linking Wick with the surrounding countryside and the village is popular with cyclists. Walks from Wick include those to the local beaches, Traeth Bach and Traeth Mawr, via the Cwm Nash footpath at Monknash or from Dunraven Bay at Southerndown. The cliffs here form part of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence (such as the earthworks associated with burial mounds, settlements and enclosures) suggests that there was settlement in Wick from around 1600BC when a small proto-Celtic community may have developed, probably farming the surrounding land on a subsistence basis. The site of an ancient beacon tower lies just north-west of the village and to the south-west, on the cliff edge at Whitmore Stairs, is the earthworks of an Iron Age univallate hillfort, part of an ancient monument known as the Cwm Bach Camps. It is thought probable that the larger of the forts that make up this monument, situated approximately away on the Trwyn y Witch (Witches Point) headland, was at one time occupied by Caratacus (who led the Silures in resistance to the Roman occupation). Given its proximity to Tusker Rock, a small island named after Tuska (a Danish Viking), it is likely that Wick was a focus for Viking attacks on the south Wales coast. Local folklore suggests that beacons were lit on high ground around the village to warn of such raids and that attacks were fiercely resisted. It is thought that the village eventually came under Norman control in around 1097AD. Scheduled ancient monuments in Wick include Buarth Mawr (comprising a barn) and Rhyle round barrow. Various archaeological finds have been made in Wick, including the discovery of a hoard of five Late Bronze Age socketed axes by Mr. Adrian Jones in 2005.

In later times it is likely that Wick formed part of a medieval drovers route, by-passing the toll road through nearby Cowbridge. &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales&quot; by Nicholas Carlisle, published 1811, recorded that in 1801 the population of Wick was 259. From 1822 parts of the village and areas of the surrounding land became part of the Dunraven Estate under the 1st Earl of Dunraven. By 1833 the population had risen to 349 according to &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Wales&quot; by Samuel Lewis, published 1833, and in 1861 the population had reached 432 according to the 1880 &quot;Slaters Commercial Directory&quot;. This then decreased to 384 by 1871 (according to the same source) and decreased further to 327 by the time of the 1891 census (the current population is 694 according to the 2001 census). The &quot;Slaters Commercial Directory&quot; also recorded that there were once 6 public houses in the village (The Carpenter Arms, The Lamb and Flag, The Royal Oak, The Star, The Steady Pointer and The Swan) of which only The Lamb and Flag and The Star remain as public houses today. There are some interesting historical features in the village, the most obvious being the windmill tower, &#x27;Melin Du&#x27;, built in 1825, and the single storey remnants of a much earlier stone windmill, &#x27;Wick Old Windmill&#x27;, near to the school. At nearby Broughton there are former brewery malthouses, used from the 1930s to the 1960s by the Quakers as holiday accommodation for children and the elderly, now converted into private flats. Some of the buildings in the village are known to be several hundred years old and 34 are now listed as &#x27;County Treasures&#x27;.

The coastline to the south and west of Wick is formed of rocks of the Lower Lias series that display horizontal stratification and are fossil bearing. It is from the top of these cliffs that, according to local folklore, the &#x27;Wreckers of Wick&#x27; would, in the times before modern navigation, lure ships onto the rocks by showing false lights and then plunder the cargo. It is recorded that the bodies of drowned sailors were recovered from the beaches by Monks from the monastic grange at nearby Monknash and taken to what is now the Plough &amp; Harrow Inn where they were prepared for burial. Historically this stretch of coastline has one of the highest instances of shipwrecks in Wales, its exposure to the Atlantic swell, south-westerly winds, shallow reefs and the Nash sands bar making it treacherous to shipping. Recorded wrecks on the 5 km stretch of coastline between Trwyn y Witch and Nash Point include: the Royal Hunter (1747), the Indian Prince (1752), the Elizabeth (1753), the Prince (1764), the George (1770), the Industry (1786), the Thomas (1806), the Bee (1820), the Harriet (1827), the Jessie Orasie (1831), the Frolic (1831), the Providence (1832), the Mayflower (1841), the New Felicity (1841), the Vigo (1842), the Betsey (1849), the Lucie (1854), the Williams (1854), the Mary &amp; Deffus (1861), the Gillies (1862), the Elphis (1865), the Amelie (1870), the New Dominian (1872), the Bessie (1872), the John &amp; Eliza (1876), the Jane &amp; Susan (1882), the Ben-y-gloe (1886), the Malleny (1886), the Caterina Camogle (1887), the Denbigh (1888), the Tilburnia (1888), the Claymore (1892), the Lizzie (1892), the Elizabeth Couch (1913), the Narcissus (1916), the Pollensa (1919) and the Cato (1951).

The parish church of Wick is dedicated to Saint James the Great, and like many of the other churches in the parish dates from the twelfth century. It began as a chapel, but was later gifted to Ewenny Priory. It is a Grade 2* listed building and consists of a chancel, nave, south porch and western &#x27;saddle back&#x27; tower. The church is built in the Early English Period style, although the oldest parts of the structure such as the chancel arch, the south door and a small window in the chancel, all date from the 12th century. The church has a medieval stone mensa (rectangular) altar, views of which are provided through the &#x27;squints&#x27; (hagioscopes) from the nave. The altar has unusual niches on either side, which probably contained statues of St James and the Blessed Virgin in centuries past. St James&#x27; was the subject of a major Victorian restoration 125 years ago and further additions have been made since then. The registers date from 1813. Wick also has a Unitarian and General Baptist Chapel that has held regular services since 1792.

Approximately to the west of the village is Monks Wood, a plantation of mixed native woodland species managed by the Woodland Trust and the Monks Wood Committee. The wood was planted with native broadleaved trees and shrubs by villagers from Wick in November 2000. A wide mown path follows a circular route through the site and there is an information display for visitors. Another area of ecological importance is Clemenstone Meadows, directly to the north of the village, comprising 2 traditionally managed meadows on either side of a brook that support a number of rare plant species.

The village was the birthplace of Sir Keith Thomas in 1933 and is currently home to the family of the Olympic gold medallist and World Champion cyclist Nicole Cooke.

Sports clubs in the village include Wick Rugby union Club and the Wick &amp; District Cricket Club.

On 28 November 2006 the village of Wick became the first community in the UK to be switched over to British Telecom&#x27;s &quot;21st Century Network&quot; (21CN); an advanced high-speed broadband network that will be rolled out throughout the UK over the coming years, replacing all of BT&#x27;s existing networks. Laura Wess, 11, made the first call using the system from Wick and Marcross Primary School to the Right Reverend John Stewart Davies, bishop of St Asaph, in North Wales.

The village won the South Wales Region Award for the 2008 Calor Village of the Year.

<doc id="558988" wikidata="Q450931" url="?curid=558988" title="Katharine Merry">
<text>Katharine Merry (born 21 September 1974) is an English former sprinter. She achieved the bronze medal in the 400 metres at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was the fastest woman in the world over 400 m in 2001, with her career best of 49.59 seconds. She also represented Great Britain at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and won the 200 metres at the 1993 European Junior Championships.

==Career==
Born in Dunchurch, Warwickshire, Merry had a career that spanned 20 years. A member of the Birchfield Harriers athletics club, at the age of 12 she topped the UK Under 13 rankings in seven different events. She was the fastest girl in the world aged 14 years, and started her international GB career aged just 13, staying on the junior team for a record six years, winning five Junior Championships and a total of six medals. She became a successful senior athlete with her Olympic medal in Sydney in the &quot;Race of the Games&quot;, achieving bronze behind the Australian favourite, Cathy Freeman, in front of 112,000 people at Stadium Australia.

The following year she became World number One. She was coached by fellow Olympic medallist Linford Christie in his Cardiff-based training squad, which included fellow Olympic medallist Darren Campbell. She is also with Christie&#x27;s sports agency, Nuff Respect. Merry still holds various UK age-record bests, including U/13 high jump and several sprints, as well as the Senior UK Indoor 200 m record of 22.83 secs. She also holds World age-records, including 7.35 secs for 60 m indoors, when aged 14. She is third-fastest on the UK All Time 400 m list with a time of 49.59 seconds.

After suffering from a bone spur growth on her right heel bone, and two operations, Merry announced her official retirement from athletics in July 2005. She had been affected by the injury since 2001 and was struggling to get it fully healed. It had prevented her from resuming proper training, meaning she could not get back to her year 2000 form. Despite that, she still ended the 2001 season as the world&#x27;s fastest female 400 m runner.

===Post-athletics===
Merry now works freelance in the media on radio and TV. She worked for the BBC at the Olympics in Beijing and London and was the sole field event commentator for the Channel 4 coverage of the Paralympic Games in 2012. At the inaugural Invictus Games in 2014, Merry did live trackside interviews. She has also worked for Sky TV, Eurosport and Channel Five. A multi-tasker, Merry now commentates, presents and hosts sporting events around the world.

Merry appeared on the BBC One gameshow &quot;All New Celebrity Total Wipeout&quot; on 25 September 2010, where she struck up a rivalry with John Regis, the man who, in her words, &quot;ate all the pies&quot;. She &quot;ran&quot; the qualifier in 2:16, beating Regis by 50 seconds, and then beating him again in the next two rounds, but losing finally in the Wipeout Zone, finishing third behind Regis and eventual winner DJ JK. She won overall, 3 events to 1.

She is a regular on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; and BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;. In December 2013, Merry came third out of four contestants on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; on BBC One. Her specialist subject was Aston Villa F.C. 1980–1990.

Merry was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame in 2018.

At the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Merry became the first female in-stadium announcer at an Olympic Games.

In January 2024, Merry was named by Aston Villa as a member of the &quot;Honorary Anniversary Board&quot; ahead of the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary season.

==Personal life==
Merry was based in Cardiff while training with Linford Christie, before moving to Bristol after retirement. Merry married her partner Leon Daniels, a recruitment consultant, in September 2014. Their son was born in February 2011 and their daughter in March 2014. The family lives in Birmingham.

<doc id="558990" wikidata="Q161810" url="?curid=558990" title="UEFA Euro 1992">
<text>The 1992 UEFA European Football Championship was hosted by Sweden between 10 and 26 June 1992. It was the ninth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.

Denmark won the 1992 championship, having been invited as qualifiers runners-ups only after Yugoslavia was disqualified as a result of the breakup of the country and the ensuing warfare there. Eight national teams contested the final tournament.

The CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States), representing the recently dissolved Soviet Union, whose national team had qualified for the tournament, were present at the tournament. It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.

It was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.

==Bid process==
On 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event. Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

==Summary==
Seven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.

Originally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia&#x27;s qualifying group, was invited to take part instead. After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they faced the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten&#x27;s kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against the reigning world champions, Germany. Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.

==Qualification==

Scotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.

As of 2024, this was the last time that both the Czech Republic and Slovakia (until 2016) (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal, and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.

===Qualified teams===
===Final draw===
The draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders). The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.

In the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last two in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.


The draw resulted in the following groups:

==Venues==
==Squads==
Each national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.

==Match ball==
Adidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament. The ball was previously used in the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

==Match officials==
;Fourth officials

==Group stage==
The teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;

===Tiebreakers===
If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:
#Goal difference in all group matches
#Greater number of goals scored in all group matches
#Drawing of lots

===Group 1===

----

===Group 2===

==Knockout stage==

In the knockout phase, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary. As with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;

===Slogan and theme song===
&quot;Small is Beautiful&quot; was the official slogan of the contest. The official anthem of the tournament was &quot;More Than a Game&quot;, performed by Towe Jaarnek and Peter Jöback.

===Logo and identity===
It was the last tournament to use the UEFA plus flag logo, and before the tournament was known as &quot;Euro&quot; (it is known as &quot;Euro 1992&quot; only retrospectively). It was also the first major football competition in which the players had their names printed on their backs, around the time that it was becoming a trend in club football across Europe.

===Mascot===
The official mascot of the competition was a rabbit coincidentally named Rabbit, dressed in a Swedish football jersey, as well as head and wristbands.

<doc id="558994" wikidata="Q17120688" url="?curid=558994" title="Sawbuck">
<text>In woodworking, a sawbuck is a structure for holding wood so that it may be cut into pieces. Easily made in the field from rough material, it consists of an &quot;X&quot; form at each end which are joined by cross bars below the intersections of the X&#x27;s. The wood to be cut is placed in the V&#x27;s formed above the intersections of the X&#x27;s.

In Canada, Britain, and the United States, a sawbuck is sometimes called a &quot;sawhorse&quot; or sawstool, although this term also refers to a similar device used (often in pairs) to support wood planks.

== United States ten-dollar bill ==

&quot;Sawbuck&quot; is also a slang term for a U.S. $10 bill, thought to be derived from the similarity between the shape of a sawbuck device and the Roman numeral X (10), which formerly appeared on $10 bills.
However, there is some question whether this etymology is accurate, as the first known appearance of the word in print refers to the $10 bill, not to the device. A twenty-dollar bill is sometimes called a &quot;double sawbuck.”

<text>Creidne was a woman warrior of the Fianna in Irish mythology. She became the champion of a warrior band after fleeing from an incestuous relationship with her father, which produced three sons.

A legend related to the Conaille Muirtheimne states that Conall Constamail mac Finnchada fathered three sons, Rúntar, Glass and Ímda (eponyms of the Dál Rúntar, Glasraige and Dál nÍmda) upon his own daughter Creidne; out of shame he banished her and her sons; she fought against her parents and only after seven years of exile did she reach a settlement.

A sail training yacht owned by the Irish Naval Service, used as a replacement for the Asgard II, is named &quot;Creidne&quot; for the mythical warrior.

<text>Aleksandras Stulginskis (26 February 1885 – 22 September 1969) was the second President of Lithuania (1920–1926). Stulginskis was also acting President of Lithuania for a few hours later in 1926, following a military coup that was led by his predecessor, President Antanas Smetona, and which had brought down Stulginskis&#x27;s successor, Kazys Grinius. The coup returned Smetona to office after Stulginskis&#x27;s brief formal assumption of the Presidency.

He began his theological studies in Kaunas and continued in Innsbruck, Austria. However, he decided not to become a priest and moved to the Institute of Agricultural Sciences in University of Halle. He graduated in 1913 and returned to Lithuania. There he started to work as a farmer. He published many articles on agronomy in Lithuanian press. In 1918 he started to publish journals &quot;Ūkininkas&quot; (&quot;Farmer&quot;) and &quot;Ūkininko kalendorius&quot; (&quot;Farmer&#x27;s Calendar&quot;).

During World War I he moved to Vilnius. He was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and the head of its Central Committee in 1917. He signed the memorandum for the president Woodrow Wilson, addressing the question of the recognition of the Lithuanian statehood by the United States. Contrary to Smetona&#x27;s views, Stulginskis was oriented towards the Entente. He was one of co-organizers of the Vilnius Conference. After, he was elected to the Council of Lithuania.

On 16 February 1918 he signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania. He was an advocate of the democratic republic as the form of the Lithuanian state. Thus, he strongly opposed the idea of monarchy (actually, Mindaugas II was the King of Lithuania from 11 July to 2 November 1918). In independent Lithuania Stulginskis was in charge of organizing the national army to defend the country against the aggressions of Bolsheviks and Poles.

Many times served as a minister, May 1920 – 1922 he was Speaker of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania and thus acting president of the republic. From 1922 to 1926 he was the second President of Lithuania. Stulginskis was Speaker of the Seimas from 1926 to 1927.

He withdrew from politics in 1927, and worked on his farm. In 1941 Stulginskis and his wife were arrested by the Soviet NKVD and deported to a gulag in the Krasnoyarsk region, while his wife was deported to the Komi area. After World War II in 1952 he was officially sentenced by the Soviet authorities to 25 years in prison for his &quot;anti-socialist and clerical policies in pre-war Lithuania&quot;.

Released after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1956, he was allowed to emigrate, yet he refused and returned to Lithuanian SSR. Stulginskis settled in Kaunas, where he died on 22 September 1969, aged 84, the last of the Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania.

<text>CITIC Group Corporation Ltd., formerly the China International Trust Investment Corporation (CITIC), is a state-owned investment company of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, established by Rong Yiren in 1979 with the approval of Deng Xiaoping. Its headquarters are in Chaoyang District, Beijing. it is China&#x27;s biggest state-run conglomerate with one of the largest pools of foreign assets in the world. In 2023, the company was ranked 71st in the Forbes Global 2000.

==Businesses==

Its initial aim was to &quot;attract and utilize foreign capital, introduce advanced technologies, and adopt advanced and scientific international practice in operation and management.&quot; It now owns 44 subsidiaries including China CITIC Bank, CITIC Limited, CITIC Trust and CITIC Merchant (mainly banks) in Mainland China, Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

==History==

CITIC Group was founded as the China International Trust Investment Corporation (; CITIC), a Chinese state-owned enterprise in 1979. In the 1980s, Chinese government founded many for profit corporations, which CITIC was under the leadership of Rong Yiren, a former businessman and politician at that time, who chose to stay in the mainland China in the 1950s after his family business was nationalized. His son, Larry Yung, was the former chairman of CITIC Group&#x27;s listed subsidiary CITIC Pacific. Larry also led the Hong Kong office and parent company of CITIC Pacific since 1986; Larry became a Hong Kong–based businessman since 1978. Throughout the 1980s, Xiong Xianghui served as CITIC vice chair and significant CITIC leadership was drawn from the Intelligence Bureau of the Joint Staff Department.

CITIC Group headquarters was based in Beijing; Hong Kong office was formally opened in 1985. The Mainland-based CITIC Bank was founded by the group in 1984. The group also acquired 12.5% stake of the Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific in 1987, and became a member of a shareholders&#x27; agreement in 2006; the stake was sold to fellow state-owned company Air China in 2009. The group also acquired Hong Kong–based Ka Wah Bank in 1986. In 1990, the group also absorbed some of the subsidiaries of another state-owned company, . Other notable acquisitions included 38.3% stake of another airline Dragonair, 20% stake of Hong Kong Telecom, etc.

CITIC also acquired a Hong Kong listed company and renamed to CITIC Pacific in the 1990s.

===2000s===

Beginning in 2008, CITIC Group had the lead role in developing Quilamba in Angola as part of an exchange of Chinese construction materials and expertise for Angolan natural resources.

Its subsidiary, CITIC Pacific (, now known as CITIC Limited), made unauthorized bets on the foreign currency market in October 2008 and lost HK$14.7 billion (US$1.9 billion, when accounted for in mark-to-market terms). Senior executives such as Financial Controller Chau Chi-Yin and Group Finance Director Leslie Chang resigned. Its stock price plunged 55.1 percent upon the resumption of trade.

In 2015, CITIC Group sold 10% stake of CITIC Limited to a joint-venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion); the joint venture also subscribed new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (or US$5.9 billion). It was reported it was the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company. The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.

In 2023, China Huarong Asset Management, the company that manages the troubled assets, contracted to buy 5.01 percent of Citic Limited for HK$13.6 billion (US$1.7 billion). Huarong will acquire a stake from CITIC Group’s subsidiary, Citic Polaris. In addition, Huarong plans to change the name to China Citic Financial Asset Management. The deal is a return on the investment that CITIC invested in 2021, leading the rescue of Huarong.

== CITIC CEFC bond default ==

In November 2016, CITIC CLSA acted as the sole bookrunner for CEFC Shanghai&#x27;s US$250 bond issuance. CITIC CLSA hid from the market that the bond deal was only 60% subscribed at pricing. It manipulated the bond price in the secondary market in an effort to offload the 100mm USD bond CITIC CLSA held on its balance sheet.

In May 2018, CITIC Group announced they would repay ca 450 million euros owed by CEFC Europe to finance and banking group J&amp;T within days but since the debt was not paid a week later, J&amp;T announced it had taken over shareholder rights and installed crisis management at CEFC Europe. Several days later, CEFC Shanghai defaulted on $327 million in bond payments, and offered to make the payments six months after the maturity date.

<doc id="559004" wikidata="Q2117500" url="?curid=559004" title="Puey Ungphakorn">
<text>Puey Ungphakorn, MBE (; ; IPA:; ; 9 March 1916 – 28 July 1999), was a Thai economist who served as Governor of the Bank of Thailand and Rector of Thammasat University. He was the author of &quot;From Womb to Tomb: The Quality of Life of a South-East Asian&quot;, which to date remains one of the most influential writings about social security in Thailand.

Born to a Thai Chinese family, Puey was a graduate of the first class of Thammasat University, teaching as a lecturer of French until winning a scholarship to study economics at the London School of Economics in 1938. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, when he joined the Free Thai resistance movement opposed to the pro-Japanese military regime of Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He was captured as a prisoner of war in 1944 after parachuting into Chai Nat Province on a reconnaissance mission.

Puey completed his studies after the war, receiving a doctorate in 1948. He joined the Ministry of Finance in 1949, serving in a progression of senior posts before becoming central bank governor in 1959. At 43, and serving for over 12 years, until 1971, Puey is to date both the youngest person appointed as, and the longest serving, Governor of the Bank of Thailand. As governor, he played a central role in shaping Thailand&#x27;s economic development policies during the governments of Field Marshals Sarit Thanarat and Thanom Kittikachorn. He also was a proponent of financial co-operation in Southeast Asia, leading to the establishment of regional financial and institutions such as the South East Asian Central Banks Research and Training Centre (SEACEN). He was awarded the Magsaysay Award in the field of government service in 1965.

An active academic, Puey was simultaneously Dean of the Faculty of Economics of Thammasat University from 1964 to 1972. In 1975 he was appointed Rector of Thammasat University, but resigned in protest following the massacre of student protesters on 6 October 1976. Tarred by nationalists as a leftist subversive, he was subsequently forced to flee the country for fear of his safety, residing in the United Kingdom until his death in 1999.

==Early life and education==
Puey was born the fourth child of an immigrant Chinese fishmonger and a second generation Thai Chinese mother, with ancestry from Raoping. In 1934 he was among the first group of students to enrol at the newly opened Thammasat University, from which he graduated in 1937. After having briefly worked as a translator, Puey earned a government scholarship to study economics at the London School of Economics in 1938.

===Free Thai movement===
Thailand joined the Second World War on the side of the Axis in January 1942, following its invasion by Japan the previous month and the subsequent decision of Thailand&#x27;s military ruler, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, to ally with rather than resist the Japanese invaders. Puey&#x27;s studies were as a result interrupted, and he joined the Free Thai Movement resisting the pro-Japanese government, helping to organise the movement in the United Kingdom. Puey was commissioned as a Captain into the British Army and underwent vigorous training with the Special Operations Executive, In November 1944 he parachuted into Chai Nat Province in northern Thailand as part of Operation APPRECIATION, intended to establish contact with the influential and anti-Japanese politician Pridi Banomyong. He was captured almost immediately, and remained technically a prisoner of war until the Japanese surrender in September 1945, though he in fact made contact with Free Thai members of the Thai police and was able to work with them from his jail cell.

After the war, Puey was promoted to the rank of Major in the British forces and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He resumed his studies, having won a Leverhulme Trust scholarship, and in 1948 received a doctorate in economics from the London School of Economics, becoming one of the first Thais to do so. His thesis, dated 1949, was titled The economics of tin control.

==Government service==
===Ministry of Finance===
In 1949 Puey became an economist in the Ministry of Finance. In 1953 he was appointed managing director of the National Economic Council.

===Bank of Thailand===
In 1953, Puey was appointed Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand. Upon becoming governor in 1959, Puey quickly attracted the attention of international agencies, foreign governments, and the international financial community for the integrity of his financial planning and management. His international stature was recognised ceremoniously in 1964 when he became the first Thai to receive the Magsaysay Award for public service. Equally important, this international recognition gave him an influence with Field Marshals Sarit Thanarat, Thanom Kittikachorn, and their cohorts which far exceeded his bureaucratic position. They sought his aid and advice as a troubleshooter for Thailand&#x27;s monetary interests, particularly in matters they had botched or in which they were suspected to have their own private interests, such as remedying Sarit&#x27;s mishandling of Thailand&#x27;s participation on an international tin council and preventing a kickback scandal over the foreign printing of Thailand&#x27;s currency.

===Other positions===
After stepping down as central bank governor, Puey was appointed to the un-elected National Legislative Assembly established under the interim constitution of December 1972 in the aftermath of Thanom&#x27;s 1971 &quot;auto-coup&quot;. After Thanom&#x27;s junta was ousted in a popular uprising in 1973, Puey was chosen by caretaker prime minister Sanya Dharmasakti, who had also served as Rector of Thammasat University, to chair the government&#x27;s Economic Advisory Council. He served in both posts until Sanya&#x27;s ministry was succeeded by the elected government of Seni Pramoj following elections in 1975.

==Academic career==
In 1966 Puey became the dean of the Faculty of Economics at his alma mater, Thammasat University, where his work with the Rockefeller Foundation and with foreign scholars dramatically upgraded the training of Thailand&#x27;s future technocrats. He also instituted a long-term research project on raising the productivity and economic level of Thai villagers. It was during this period that he was invited to serve as a visiting professor at both Cambridge and Princeton universities and was appointed to the governing boards of such organisations as the International Council for Educational Development, the East-West Center (EWC), the Asian Institute of Management, and the International Food Policy Research Institute.

Puey played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Bangkok-based Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), previously the Graduate School of Engineering of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1967. Dr Puey became the first chairperson of the AIT Board of Trustees from 1968 to 1973.

After the ousting of Thanom&#x27;s regime in October 1973, Puey was catapulted into political prominence and, along with M.R. Kukrit Pramoj, was broadly promoted as one of the two major candidates for the post of prime minister in the elected government that would follow the palace-picked interim administration of Sanya Thammasak. However, after a great deal of self-examination, Puey disavowed all interest in such a candidacy and returned to Thammasat, where he was appointed rector. Puey&#x27;s explanation was that when he had joined the Free Thai Movement he had taken an oath never to seek or accept political appointment until after reaching the age of retirement. Some have argued, however, that Puey&#x27;s withdrawal was based upon his mature understanding of the nature of society and that he had accurately foreseen that the upcoming democratic period would be inherently unstable, dangerous, and short-lived.

==Exile==

Despite his service, honesty and international reputation, Puey was branded a communist and &quot;destroyer of unity&quot; by the political right of Thailand. Although he spoke out against the unending student demonstrations of 1975–76 as being both ineffective and self-destructive, and even denied his students any use of the Thammasat campus as a base for mounting public demonstrations, he was nevertheless assigned blame for their occurrence.

On the evening of the bloody 6 October 1976 Massacre, Puey resigned from his position as rector of Thammasat in protest against the bloodbath that had occurred that day on the university campus. Realising he was a marked man, Puey went to Don Mueang airport where he was met by a lynch mob. Only with the help of the Royal Thai Air Force Air Police, who had been instructed by King Bhumibol&#x27;s privy council office to help him leave, did he evade death and get on a plane bound for London.

While living abroad, Puey met with Thais and influential figures in several countries, including those in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, and Australia to speak about the incident and to call for a peaceful transition to democracy in Thailand. In 1977, Puey gave testimonials before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs investigating human rights in Thailand following the incident of 6 October 1976 Massacre.

In September 1977, Puey suffered a haemorrhagic stroke and was confined to a hospital for three months. The illness left Puey with a speech impediment resulting in mumbling speech. He could walk by himself, but was unable to control his right hand. Puey died in London on 28 July 1999.

==Legacy==
In 2015 he was recognised by UNESCO for his high ethical standards.

<text>Kazys Grinius (, 17 December 1866 – 4 June 1950) was the third President of Lithuania, holding the office from 7 June 1926 to 17 December 1926. Previously, he had served as the fifth Prime Minister of Lithuania, from 19 June 1920 until his resignation on 18 January 1922. He was posthumously awarded the Lithuanian Life Saving Cross for saving people during the Holocaust and was recognised as a Righteous Among the Nations in 2016.

Grinius was born in , near Marijampolė, in the Augustów Governorate of Congress Poland, which was part of the Russian Empire. He studied medicine at the Imperial Moscow University and became a physician. As a young man, he became involved in Lithuanian political activities, and was persecuted by the Tsarist authorities. In 1896, he was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP) and Lithuanian Popular Peasants&#x27; Union (LVLS) party. That same year he married Joana Pavalkytė. For some time they lived in Virbalis. In 1899, their son Kazys (later head of the Lithuanian National Council) was born, and in 1902, their daughter Gražina was born. During World War I they lived in Kislovodsk. In 1918, during a Red Army attack, his wife and daughter were murdered by Russian terrorists. They were buried in Kislovodsk cemetery.

When Lithuania regained its independence in 1918, Grinius became a member of the Constituent Assembly as a member of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants&#x27; Union party. He served as prime minister from 1920 until 1922, and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union. He was elected president by the Third Seimas, but served for only six months, as he was deposed in a coup led by Antanas Smetona on the pretext of an imminent communist plot to take over Lithuania. Grinius then practiced medicine in Kaunas. When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania in 1941, Grinius refused to collaborate with the Germans because of his opposition to the occupation of Lithuania by any foreign power. He fled to the West when the Soviet army reoccupied Lithuania in 1944, and he emigrated to the United States in 1947.

He died in Chicago in 1950. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, his remains were returned and buried near his home village.

==Early life==

===Family===
Of noble (&quot;szlachta&quot;) lineage, the Griniai family moved to the region of Suvalkija during the Volok Reform of 1560. Kazys Grinius was born on 17 December 1866, in the village of , then known as &quot;Selemos Būda&quot;. The village belonged to the Augustów Governorate of Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. Grinius was the third child out of the family&#x27;s eleven (two of whom would die in infancy). His father, Vincas Grinius (1837–1915) was a farmer who owned 15 hectares of land. A nephew of writer and leader of the January Uprising Mikalojus Akelaitis, Vincas could speak Russian and Polish, and owned a small library containing prayer books and the works of Laurynas Ivinskis, Motiejus Valančius and Petras Vileišis. Grinius&#x27;s mother Ona Griniuvienė née Vosyliūtė (1839–1919) was a strict and religious Catholic. Two of Grinius&#x27; siblings, Jonas Grinius (1877–1954) and Ona Griniūtė-Bacevičienė (1884–1972) were book smugglers during the Lithuanian press ban. Ona&#x27;s nephew Vytautas Bacevičius-Vygandas was an officer in the Lithuanian Liberty Army, Povilas Plechavičius&#x27;s Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, as well as chief of headquarters of the Tauras military district of the Lithuanian partisans.
===School years (1876–1887)===
Grinius learned to read from his mother, and to count and write from his father. In 1876, at the age of nine, Grinius began to attend the Oszkinie Russian primary school, three months later switching to school in Gudeliai. He also attended school in Marijampolė before being accepted at the Marijampolė Gymnasium in 1879 at the age of twelve. Since the Lithuanian language in the region wasn&#x27;t banned but rather acted as an optional school subject, Grinius mostly spoke Polish with his classmates before beginning to attend Lithuanian classes in third grade. His tutors were Petras Arminas-Trupinėlis and Petras Kriaučiūnas. Inspired by the release of the first Lithuanian newspaper &quot;Aušra&quot; in 1883, Grinius and future poet Jonas Mačys-Kėkštas published their own newspaper entitled &quot;Priešaušris&quot;. Grinius was also adamant that prayer would be conducted in Lithuanian rather than Polish. Grinius then began smuggling &quot;Aušra&quot; and other illegal publications, sometimes bringing them from Prussia by himself.

===Studies and activism (1887–1914)===
After graduating in 1887, Grinius began studying medicine at Moscow State University, where he became a member of a secret society of Lithuanian students. He was its chairman from 1889 until his graduation. The society organized self-education and self-sufficiency of students and distributed Lithuanian press, cooperating with Latvian and Polish student societies. Grinius suggested that the 300 rubles the society won through a lottery should be used for the publication of Lithuanian books; the students subsequently established a fund to publish Lithuanian books (&quot;Fondas lietuvių knygoms leisti&quot;). Grinius also published his first article in a United States-based newspaper &quot;Lietuviškasis balsas&quot;. In 1888 at the age of twenty-two, along with Vincas Kudirka, Grinius and six others participated in a gathering in Marijampolė, in the so-called first congress of Lithuanian democrats, where they decided to begin the publication of the newspaper &quot;Varpas&quot;. In 1893, he was elected member of the Varpininkai organization committee. Grinius organized the publishing of &quot;Ūkininkas&quot;. Along with other students he wrote &quot;A Short History of Ancient Lithuanians&quot; (&quot;Trumpa senovės Lietuvių istorija&quot;), which was published in 1892 in Tilsit (modern-day Sovetsk). During vacation, Grinius would travel across Lithuania and distribute Lithuanian newspapers, lead &quot;anti-state propaganda&quot;, and collect folklore. As a member of the 1899 Russian student strike, Grinius was arrested for 9 days and put in Butyrka prison. In 1892, he was a doctor who treated cholera patients in Minsk. During his study years, Grinius lived a poor and ascetic life. After graduating, Grinius did not have enough money to settle in Lithuania, and so became a ship doctor in the Caspian Sea for about nine months.

After returning to Lithuania in 1894, Grinius earned a living as a free-for-hire doctor in Marijampolė. After two years he moved to Virbalis, and later to Kudirkos Naumiestis. Grinius helped establish the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in 1896, preparing its first newspaper &quot;Lietuvos darbininkas&quot; and translating the party&#x27;s program from Polish into Lithuanian. He also was one of the establishers of the Lithuanian Democratic Party in 1902 who prepared its program in 1906, as well as writing the program of the Peasant Union. An active member of the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party, Grinius edited the last edition of &quot;Varpas&quot;. From 1898 to 1902 he lived in Pilviškiai, replacing Stasys Matulaitis as the local book smuggler. From 1897 to 1899 he edited the newspaper &quot;Ūkininkas&quot;. After returning to Marijmapolė, he was briefly imprisoned for Lithuanian cultural activism. His family home became a center of the Lithuanian cultural movement in the region of Užnemunė (west of the Nemunas river). Grinius helped write petitions from local peasants to the governor of the Suwałki Governorate. In his opinion, these few years when Lithuanians became more culturally active became the foreground for the Great Seimas of Vilnius. In 1905, he lived in Vilnius, moving back to Marijampolė in 1906 only to be imprisoned along with his wife for two weeks. 

Grinius was also one of the founding members of &quot;Šviesa&quot; in 1905, a society dedicated to the establishment of schools, pedagogical evening courses, bookstores, distribution of Lithuanian publications, and assisting young students. Although the society was illegal and soon had to be closed down, it was made legal again in 1907 and expanded into as many as twenty-three chapters in the Suwałki Governorate. Nonetheless the society experienced a search by Tsarist authorities in 1908, after which Grinius among many others were arrested and imprisoned in a prison in Kalvarija. After that, Grinius&#x27;s family was ordered to leave their home, after which they moved to Vilnius. The society was fully liquidated in 1911. In 1906, a text he wrote entitled &quot;The Correct Land Management in Lithuania&quot; (&quot;Teisingas žemės valdymas Lietuvoje&quot;) was published as a separate book which contained many ideas that were to be found later in the 1922 Lithuanian land reform. From 1908 to 1910 he lived in Vilnius. In 1909, along with Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė he edited &quot;Lietuvos žinios&quot;, and in 1910, he edited &quot;Lietuvos ūkininkas&quot; with Albinas Rimka. Once again, he was imprisoned in Marijampolė for a month and a half. A member of the secret book smuggling Sietynas organization, Grinius also published on topics such as botany, medicine, and history.

==First World War==
During the First World War Grinius and his family moved away from the front deeper into Russia. He arrived in the northern Caucasus in 1915, and worked there until 1918, firstly at Nalchik and then as head doctor in a war hospital near Grozny. While in the Caucasus, Grinius took care of Lithuanian refugees. In 1917, Grinius, Jonas Jablonskis, and Pranas Mašiotas established the Supreme Council of Lithuanians in Russia in Voronezh, whose purpose was to unite all political parties under a new authority. During the start of the Russian Civil War Grinius and his family lived in Kislovodsk, where Bolshevik forces shot his wife and fatally injured his daughter on 8 October 1918. They were buried in the nearby Orthodox cemetery. Grinius and his two sons, Kazys and Jurgis, fled to Novorossiysk, from where he boarded a ship to the Mediterrannean Sea to travel to France, before returning to Lithuania in November. Jurgis at this point was sick, and died not having reached Lithuania. He is buried in southern France.

==Political career==

===Constituent Assembly (1920)===
In 1919, Grinius was chairman of the Paris-based Lithuanian Repatriation Commission which helped Lithuanian prisoners of war in Germany return home. That same year he returned to Lithuania to prepare for Constituent Assembly of Lithuania&#x27;s elections as leader of a bloc between the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party and the Peasant Union. During the election campaign, Grinius criticized the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. Grinius actively advocated convening the parliament mentioned in the Act of Independence of Lithuania, which was supposed to determine the nature of the structure of the country, criticizing the delay of the right-wing parties in convening it, using the Estonians as an example who elected the parliament in 1919. In 1920, he was elected to the city council of Marijampolė, becoming its chairman. After the Kaunas garrison mutiny he urged president Antanas Smetona to hold elections as quickly as possible. The elections were held on 14–15 April, with Grinius&#x27;s bloc getting second place before the Christian Democratic Party. Grinius urged the assembly&#x27;s speaker Aleksandras Stulginskis to leave his party and prepare laws carefully. Grinius defended the interests of minorities; he proposed to include Polish representatives in the commission&#x27;s work, and to allow the Jews to speak in the language of their choice. He also formed a resolution in which it was stated that the death penalty would not be done until amnesty was declared. On 19 June 1920, Grinius became the prime minister of the Christian Democrat and Peasant Union-led government coalition, a title he kept until 2 February 1922.

===Prime minister (1920–1922)===
During his tenure, Grinius&#x27;s government finished negotiations with the Soviet Union by signing a peace treaty, finalized the border with Poland, and rejected Paul Hymans&#x27;s suggested union with the country. Lithuania was also accepted into the League of Nations. The tax system was reformed, hospitals and schools were established and expanded, and public transport was developed. Funds were allocated for the establishment of the Lithuanian Drama Theater and the conservation of Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis&#x27;s paintings, and the Vytautas Magnus University (then the University of Lithuania) was founded. Corruption was fought and preparatory works for land reform were completed. However, the government coalition dissolved as the Christian Democrat Party, which sought to recover land for the Catholic church that was confiscated and given to the Orthodox in the Russian Empire, disagreed with the Peasant Union. On 13 January 1922, a fraction of the Peasant Union discharged Grinius from the position of prime minister, with Grinius officially resigning on 18 January. The government was succeeded by Ernestas Galvanauskas&#x27;s cabinet of ministers.

===Member of the Seimas (1922–1926)===
After his resignation, Grinius continued to be an active member of the Lithuanian Seimas. He helped prepare the permanent Lithuanian constitution, which was initiated on 1 August 1922. That same year, he became the head of the medical and sanitation department of the Kaunas city municipality. As a representative of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants&#x27; Union, Grinius was elected to the first, second, and third Seimas. Grinius was a member of the political opposition who defended freedom of the press, minority rights, advocated for bigger attention to healthcare and education, and criticized peoples&#x27; such as Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, Augustinas Voldemaras, Antanas Smetona, and Juozas Purickis call to focus diplomatic efforts towards the USSR; it was hoped that this way Lithuania could get the Vilnius region back under its control and defend itself from Poland. In 1924, Grinius published an article entitled &quot;Mūsų rusofilai&quot; (Our Russophiles) in which he wrote that, &quot;It&#x27;s naive to believe that the USSR, which hasn&#x27;t abandoned in Tsarist Russian imperialism, will give Vilnius to Lithuania&quot;, encouraging the government to rather ally itself with Great Britain and other Baltic countries.

===President (1926)===
On 7 June 1926, Grinius was elected President of Lithuania. During his tenure, Grinius enacted a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, by which it recognized Lithuanian rights to the Vilnius region. Savings were also allocated to road construction, industry, education, and cultural affairs. Martial law and restrictions on censorship were abolished. The country also began trade negotiations with Germany and the Soviet Union. As president, Grinius did not use state transportation, preferring to travel to villages in passenger cars. When family would inquire about his choice, Grinius would respond that the Lithuanians live too poorly. However, Grinius&#x27;s democratic reforms were met with disapproval from conservatives. Kazys Škirpa&#x27;s army reforms caused resentment from the officers as well.

====Coup d&#x27;état====
On 17 December 1926, on the evening of Grinius&#x27;s birthday, a coup was arranged that replaced the government with an authoritarian one headed by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the most conservative party at the time. Grinius called the coup a crime against society, and blamed the nationalists, Christian Democrats, and part of the army for it, stating that the factual and psychological reasons for the coup were deep, reaching back to the first years of independence, when nationalists who represented the wealthiest strata of society had monarchical ambitions. Augustinas Voldemaras noted to a German envoy that the thoughts of a coup reached back as early as 1922. The nationalists, using the fact that all commanders of military units were invited to Grinius&#x27;s birthday, took control of military and civilian institutions, arresting Mykolas Sleževičius and Grinius. According to Grinius&#x27;s own memoirs, Povilas Plechavičius, one of the main instigators, became &quot;dictator&quot; not by his own choice. Grinius promptly resigned to &quot;save Lithuania from possible misfortunes&quot;. Smetona and his party justified the coup by saying that a Communist takeover was imminent. According to Grinius&#x27;s own memoirs, the claim was false.

==Post-political career==
After the coup, Grinius continued working in the Kaunas city municipality, building the foundation for a healthcare system. On 6 December 1928, he was given a permanent pension of 1,200 Litai. He continued his medical career by heading some health societies, editing the newspaper &quot;Battle with Consumption&quot; (&quot;Kova su džiova&quot;) and &quot;Drop of Milk&quot; (&quot;Pieno lašas&quot;), and translating fictional and scientific literature. In a 1939 journal entitled &quot;Varpininkų kelias&quot; he wrote an article explaining the benefits of democratic society, that in the future Lithuania will be democratic, and that the citizens should elect a President directly rather than the parliament. In another journal he promoted non-violence against Lithuanian Jews.

===Occupation===
During Soviet occupation, Grinius edited the newspaper &quot;Liaudies sveikata&quot; and headed the Kaunas Hygiene Museum. In 1942, during Nazi German occupation, Grinius, Konradas Aleksa, and Mykolas Krupavičius signed a memorandum for the German general commissar in Kaunas on the killing of Jews and colonization of Lithuania. The authors of the memorandum were promptly arrested. Aleksa and Krupavičius were driven to Germany, while Grinius was deported to his home village of Selema.

==Emigration and last years==

In 1944, with help from his family, Grinius emigrated to the West. His archive of photos, letters, etc. was destroyed in the process. He began writing his memoirs anew in a German displaced persons camp in Germany. Its first volume was published in 1947 in Tübingen. That same year he moved to the United States and collaborated with the Lithuanian émigré press. Grinius wrote to sixteen country leaders asking them for aid.

Grinius died on 4 June 1950 in Chicago. His urn and remains were moved to Lithuania on 8 October 1994 and buried near Selema in Mondžgirė.

<doc id="559009" wikidata="Q239506" url="?curid=559009" title="Dragon Ball (TV series)">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation that ran for 153 episodes from February 26, 1986, to April 19, 1989, on Fuji TV. The series is an adaptation of the first 194 chapters of the manga series of the same name created by Akira Toriyama, which were published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1984 to 1995. It was broadcast in 81countries worldwide and is the first television series adaptation in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise. The series follows the adventures of Goku, a young eccentric boy with a monkey tail and exceptional strength who has a passion for fighting and battling evil-doers.

Film adaptations include: &quot;Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies&quot; (1986), &quot;Dragon Ball: Sleeping Princess in Devil&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1987), and &quot;Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure&quot; (1988). The series was followed by a sequel, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, which had its own follow-ups with &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. The English dubbed version of the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series released in the United States was edited for content and dialogue.

==Plot==
=== Emperor Pilaf Saga ===
The series begins with a young monkey-tailed boy named Goku who lives alone in a forest befriending a teenage girl named Bulma, who is in search of the seven mystical , one of which is in Goku&#x27;s possession. Together, they go on an adventure to find the balls, which summon the eternal dragon Shenron and grants whoever summons him any wish. The journey leads Goku to meeting Master Roshi and a confrontation with the shape-shifting pig Oolong, as well as a desert bandit named Yamcha and his companion Pu&#x27;ar, and the Ox-King, who all later become allies; Chi-Chi, whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry; and Emperor Pilaf, a blue-skinned imp who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his desire for world domination. Oolong stops Pilaf from getting his wish by wishing for a pair of perfect panties. After each wish, all the Dragon Balls are scattered all over the world and take one full year to take on their distinctive appearance.

=== World Martial Arts Tournament Saga ===
After finding the Dragon Balls and using them, Goku undergoes rigorous training under world renowned martial artist Master Roshi in order to fight in the , a competitive fighting tournament that attracts fighters from all around the world. A monk named Krillin becomes Goku&#x27;s training partner and rival, but they quickly become best friends. After training with Master Roshi for a few months, Goku and Krillin start in the tournament, which is held every five years. They battle through with various opponents and Yamcha fights a mysterious man named Jackie Chun, who looks and fights oddly similar to Master Roshi. As the tournament continues, Goku and Jackie Chun are the final fighters, and after hours of battle, Jackie Chun realizes Goku is mimicking all of his moves. Recognizing that Goku is shorter, he lunges a flying kick at Goku. Knowing that Goku will do one right back, Jackie Chun&#x27;s longer leg can reliably reach Goku and knock him out, defeating him.

=== Red Ribbon Army Saga ===
After the tournament, Goku sets out on his own to recover the Dragon Ball his deceased grandfather left him and encounters a terrorist organization known as the Red Ribbon Army, whose diminutive leader, Commander Red, wants to collect the Dragon Balls so he can use them to become taller. Goku mostly single-handedly defeats the entire group, including Mercenary Tao, a feared assassin the Red Ribbon hired; whom Goku originally loses to, but after training under the hermit Korin, easily beats. After defeating Tao, Goku sets his sights on the Red Ribbon Army headquarters, where he plans to take the two Dragon Balls in the army&#x27;s possession. After defeating the Red Ribbon Army, Goku reunites with his friends and they go to Fortuneteller Baba to locate the last remaining Dragon Ball in order to resurrect Upa&#x27;s father, who was defeated by Tao, but they have to defeat all five of Baba&#x27;s fighters first. After defeating Baba&#x27;s fighters and finding the last Dragon Ball, Goku resurrects Upa&#x27;s father, Bora, and sets out on his own to train for three years.

=== King Piccolo Saga ===
Goku and his friends reunite at the World Martial Arts Tournament three years later and meet Master Roshi&#x27;s rival and Tao&#x27;s brother, Master Shen, and his students Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, who vow to exact revenge for Tao&#x27;s apparent death at the hands of Goku. Krillin is murdered after the tournament and Goku tracks down and is defeated by his killer, Tambourine, and the evil Demon King Piccolo, who was freed by Emperor Pilaf after being sealed away by Master Mutaito after destroying and trying to take over the world. Goku meets the overweight samurai Yajirobe, who takes Goku to Korin after being defeated by Tambourine and receives healing and a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo kills both Master Roshi and Chiaotzu, and uses the Dragon Balls to give himself eternal youth before destroying Shenron, which results in the Dragon Balls&#x27; destruction. As King Piccolo prepares to destroy West City as a show of force, Tien Shinhan arrives to confront him, but is defeated and nearly killed by one of Piccolo&#x27;s spawns. Goku arrives in time to save Tien and then kills King Piccolo by blasting a hole through his chest.

=== Piccolo Junior Saga ===
Just before Piccolo dies, he spawns his final son, Piccolo Junior. Korin informs Goku that Kami, the creator of the Dragon Balls, might be able to restore Shenron and the Dragon Balls so that Goku can wish his fallen friends back to life, which he does. He also stays and trains under Kami for the next three years, once again reuniting with his friends for the World Martial Arts Tournament, as well as a now-teenaged Chi-Chi and a revived cyborg Mercenary Tao. Piccolo Junior enters the tournament to avenge his father, leading to the final battle between him and Goku. After Goku narrowly wins and defeats Piccolo Junior, he leaves with Chi-Chi and they get married, leading to the events of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

==Production==
Kazuhiko Torishima, Toriyama&#x27;s editor for &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; and the first half of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, said that because the &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; anime was not successful in his opinion, he and Shueisha were a lot more hands on for the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime. Before production even began, they created a huge &quot;bible&quot; for the series detailing even merchandise. He himself studied the best way to present anime and its business side, discussing it with the Shogakukan team for &quot;Doraemon&quot;.

Toriyama had some involvement in the production of the anime. When it began he did mention to the staff that they seemed to be making it too colorful by forcing the color palette of &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; on it. He also listened to the voice actors&#x27; audition tapes before choosing Masako Nozawa to play Goku. He would go on to state that he would hear Nozawa&#x27;s voice in his head when writing the manga. Toriyama specified Kuririn&#x27;s voice actress be Mayumi Tanaka after hearing her work as the main character Giovanni in &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot;. Tōru Furuya remarked that there were not many auditions for the characters because the cast was made up of veteran voice actors. Performing the roles was not without its difficulties, Toshio Furukawa, the voice of Piccolo, said it was difficult to constantly perform with a low voice because his normal lighter voice would break through if he broke concentration.

Shunsuke Kikuchi composed the score for &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. The opening theme song for all of the episodes is performed by Hiroki Takahashi in Japanese and Jimi Tunnell in English. The ending theme is performed by Ushio Hashimoto in Japanese and Daphne Gere in English.

Feeling that the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime&#x27;s ratings were gradually declining because it had the same producer that worked on &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, who had a &quot;cute and funny&quot; image connected to Toriyama&#x27;s work and was missing the more serious tone, Torishima asked the studio to change the producer. Impressed with their work on &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, he asked its director Kōzō Morishita and writer Takao Koyama to help &quot;reboot&quot; &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;; which coincided with the beginning of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

===English localization and broadcasting===
In 1989 and 1990, Harmony Gold USA licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. In the voice dubbing of the series, Harmony Gold renamed almost all of the characters, including the protagonist Goku, who was renamed &quot;Zero.&quot; This dub consisting of 5 episodes and one movie (an 80-minute feature featuring footage of movies 1 and 3 edited together) was cancelled shortly after being test marketed in several US cities and was never broadcast to the general public, thus earning the fan-coined term &quot;The Lost Dub.&quot;

A subtitled Japanese version of the series was first broadcast in the United States by the Hawaii-based Nippon Golden Network. The series aired in a 6AM slot on Tuesdays from 1992 to 1994, before the network moved on to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

In 1995, Funimation (founded a year earlier in California) acquired the license for the distribution of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in the United States as one of its first imports. Licensing director Bob Brennan firmly believed he had found the Japanese equivalent of Mickey Mouse but had trouble convincing Americans of this. They contracted Josanne B. Lovick Productions and voice actors from Ocean Productions to create an English version for the anime and first movie in Vancouver, British Columbia. The dubbed episodes were edited for content, and contained different music. Thirteen episodes aired in first-run syndication during the fall of 1995 before Funimation canceled the project due to low ratings and moved on to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

In March 2001, due to the success of their dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, Funimation announced the return of the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series to American television, featuring a new English version produced in-house with slightly less editing for broadcast (though the episodes remained uncut for home video releases), and they notably left the original background music intact. The re-dubbed episodes aired on Cartoon Network from August 20, 2001, to December 1, 2003. Funimation also broadcast the series on Colours TV and their own Funimation Channel starting in 2006. This English dub was also broadcast in Australia and New Zealand. In Canada and Europe, an alternative dubbed version was produced by AB Groupe (in association with Blue Water Studios) and was aired in those territories instead of the Funimation version.

====Content edits====
The US version of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was aired on Cartoon Network with numerous digital cosmetic changes, which were done to remove nudity and blood, and dialogue edits, such as when Puar says why Oolong was expelled from shapeshifting school, instead of saying that he stole the teacher&#x27;s panties, it was changed to him stealing the teacher&#x27;s papers. Some scenes were deleted altogether, either to save time or remove strong violence. Nudity was also covered up; for Goku&#x27;s bathing scene, Funimation drew a chair to cover his genitals where it was uncensored previously. References to alcohol and drugs were removed, for example, when Jackie Chun (Master Roshi) uses Drunken Fist Kung Fu in the 21st &quot;Tenkaichi Budokai&quot;, Funimation called it the &quot;Mad Cow Attack.&quot; Also, the famous &quot;No Balls!&quot; scene was deleted from episode 2, and when Bulma places panties on the fishing hook to get Oolong (in fish form), they digitally painted away the panties and replaced it with some money.

Changes also led to confusing context and the content of the scenes; such as when Bulma helps Goku take a bath. In the Japanese version, the two characters do not cover their privates because Goku is innocent of the differences in gender and Bulma believes Goku to be a little boy. While bathing Bulma asks Goku his age and only when Goku reveals himself to be fourteen does Bulma throw things at Goku before kicking him out of the bath. In the BLT and Funimation versions, the dialogue was changed; with Goku remarking that Bulma did not have a tail and it must be inconvenient for her when bathing.

==Other media==

===Home media===
In Japan, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; did not receive a proper home video release until July 7, 2004, fifteen years after its broadcast. Pony Canyon announced a remastering of the series in a single 26-disc DVD box set, that was made-to-order only, referred to as a &quot;Dragon Box&quot;. Since then, Pony Canyon content of this set began being released on mass-produced individual 6-episode DVDs on April 4, 2007, and finished with the 26th volume on December 5, 2007.

==== Original releases ====
&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;&#x27;s initial VHS release for North America was never completed. Funimation released their initial dub, the edited and censored first thirteen episodes, on six tapes from September 24, 1996, to February 28, 1998, together with Trimark Pictures. These episodes and the first movie were later released in a VHS or DVD box set on October 24, 2000. Funimation began releasing their in-house dub beginning with episode 14 by themselves on December 5, 2001, in both edited and uncut formats, only to cease VHS releases two years later on June 1, 2003, in favor for the DVD box sets. Including the initial 1996-1998 releases with Trimark, 86 episodes of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; across 28 volumes were produced on VHS for North America.

Funimation released their own in-house dub to ten two-disc DVD box sets between January 28 and August 19, 2003. Each box set, spanning an entire &quot;saga&quot; of the series, included the English and Japanese audio tracks with optional English subtitles, and uncut video and audio. However, they were unable to release the first thirteen episodes at the time, due to Lions Gate Entertainment holding the home video rights to their previous dub of the same episodes, having acquired them from Trimark after the company became defunct. After Lions Gate Family Entertainment&#x27;s license and home video distribution rights to the first thirteen episodes expired in 2009, Funimation has released and remastered the complete &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series to DVD in five individual uncut season box sets, with the first set released on September 15, 2009, and the final on July 27, 2010.

Funimation&#x27;s English dub of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; has been distributed in other countries by third parties. Madman Entertainment released the first thirteen episodes of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and the first movie uncut in Australasia in a DVD set on March 10, 2004. They produced two box sets containing the entire series in 2006 and 2007. Manga Entertainment began releasing Funimation&#x27;s five remastered sets in the United Kingdom in 2014.

&quot;Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!&quot; (ドラゴンボール オッス！帰ってきた孫悟空と仲間たち！！ Doragon Bōru: Ossu! Kaette Kita Son Gokū to Nakama-tachi!!) is the second &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; OVA and features the first &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; animation in nearly a decade, following a short story arc in the remade &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; anime series featuring Goku and the Red Ribbon Army in 1999. The film premiered in Japan on September 21, 2008, at the Jump Super Anime Tour in honor of Weekly Shōnen Jump&#x27;s fortieth anniversary. &quot;Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!&quot; is also in the extra DVD included in the &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot; limited edition, which was released on September 13, 2013.

===Manga===
===Films===
During the anime&#x27;s broadcast, three theatrical animated &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; films were produced. The first was &quot;Curse of the Blood Rubies&quot; in 1986, followed by &quot;Sleeping Princess in Devil&#x27;s Castle&quot; in 1987, and &quot;Mystical Adventure&quot; in 1988. In 1996 &quot;The Path to Power&quot; was produced in order to commemorate the anime&#x27;s tenth anniversary.

===Video games===

Several video games based on &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; have been created, beginning with &quot;Dragon Daihikyō&quot; in 1986. &quot;Shenlong no Nazo&quot;, produced that same year, was the first to be released outside Japan. 1988&#x27;s North American version was titled &quot;Dragon Power&quot; and was heavily Americanized with all references to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; removed; characters&#x27; names and appearances were changed. Additional games based on the series include &quot;Advanced Adventure&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball: Origins&quot;, its sequel, and &quot;Revenge of King Piccolo&quot;.

===Soundtracks===

&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; has been host to several soundtrack releases, the first being &quot;Dragon Ball: Music Collection&quot; in 1986. &quot;Dragon Ball: Saikyō e no Michi Original Soundtrack&quot; is composed entirely of music from the tenth anniversary film. In 1995 &quot;Dragon Ball: Original USA TV Soundtrack Recording&quot; was released featuring the music from the Funimation/Ocean American broadcast.

==Reception==
The show&#x27;s initial U.S. broadcast run in 1995 met with mediocre ratings.

In 2000 satellite TV channel Animax together with &quot;Brutus&quot;, a men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan&#x27;s largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; coming in fourth. TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; came in second in the nationwide survey conducted among multiple age-groups and third in the online poll. On several occasions the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime has topped Japan&#x27;s DVD sales.

&quot;Otaku USA&quot;″s Joseph Luster called &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; &quot;one of the most memorable animated action/comedy series of all time.&quot; He cited the comedy as a key component to the show, noting that this might surprise those only familiar with &quot;Z&quot;. Todd Douglass of DVD Talk referred to it as &quot;a classic among classics [that] stands as a genre defining kind of show.&quot; and wrote that &quot;It&#x27;s iconic in so many ways and should be standard watching for otaku in order to appreciate the genius of Akira Toriyama.&quot; He had strong praise for the &quot;deep, insightful, and well-developed&quot; characters, writing &quot;Few shows can claim to have a cast quite like Dragon Ball&#x27;s, and that&#x27;s a testament to the creative genius of Toriyama.&quot;

T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews&#x27; Tim Jones gave the show four out of five stars, referring to it as a forerunner to modern fighting anime and still one of the best. He also stated that it has much more character development than its successors &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; as &quot;an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure.&quot; Kimlinger and Theron Martin, also of Anime News Network, noted Funimation&#x27;s reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub.

The positive impact of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;&#x27;s characters has manifested itself in the personal messages Masako Nozawa sent to children as taped messages in the voice of Goku. Nozawa takes pride in her role and sends words of encouragement that have resulted in children in comas responding to the voice of the characters.

<doc id="559011" wikidata="Q133598" url="?curid=559011" title="Lactococcus lactis">
<text>Lactococcus lactis is a gram-positive bacterium used extensively in the production of buttermilk and cheese, but has also become famous as the first genetically modified organism to be used alive for the treatment of human disease. &quot;L. lactis&quot; cells are cocci that group in pairs and short chains, and, depending on growth conditions, appear ovoid with a typical length of 0.5 - 1.5 μm. &quot;L. lactis&quot; does not produce spores (nonsporulating) and are not motile (nonmotile). They have a homofermentative metabolism, meaning they produce lactic acid from sugars. They&#x27;ve also been reported to produce exclusive -(+)-lactic acid. However, reported -(−)-lactic acid can be produced when cultured at low pH. The capability to produce lactic acid is one of the reasons why &quot;L. lactis&quot; is one of the most important microorganisms in the dairy industry. Based on its history in food fermentation, &quot;L. lactis&quot; has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, with few case reports of it being an opportunistic pathogen.

&quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; is of crucial importance for manufacturing dairy products, such as buttermilk and cheeses. When &quot;L. lactis&quot; ssp.&quot; lactis&quot; is added to milk, the bacterium uses enzymes to produce energy molecules (ATP), from lactose. The byproduct of ATP energy production is lactic acid. The lactic acid produced by the bacterium curdles the milk, which then separates to form curds that are used to produce cheese. Other uses that have been reported for this bacterium include the production of pickled vegetables, beer or wine, some breads, and other fermented foodstuffs like soymilk kefir, buttermilk, and others. &quot;L. lactis&quot; is one of the best characterized low GC Gram positive bacteria with detailed knowledge on genetics, metabolism and biodiversity.

&quot;L. lactis&quot; is mainly isolated from either the dairy environment, or plant material. Dairy isolates are suggested to have evolved from plant isolates through a process in which genes without benefit in the rich milk were lost or downregulated. This process, called genome erosion or reductive evolution, has been described in several other lactic acid bacteria. The proposed transition from the plant to the dairy environment was reproduced in the laboratory through experimental evolution of a plant isolate that was cultivated in milk for a prolonged period. Consistent with the results from comparative genomics (see references above), this resulted in &quot;L. lactis&quot; losing or downregulating genes that are dispensable in milk and the upregulation of peptide transport.

Hundreds of novel small RNAs were identified by Meulen et al. in the genome of &quot;L. lactis MG1363&quot;. One of them, LLnc147, was shown to be involved in carbon uptake and metabolism.

==Cheese production==
&quot;L. lactis&quot; subsp. &quot;lactis&quot; (formerly &quot;Streptococcus lactis&quot;) is used in the early stages for the production of many cheeses, including brie, camembert, Cheddar, Colby, Gruyère, Parmesan, and Roquefort. The use of &quot;L. lactis&quot; in dairy factories is not without issues. Bacteriophages specific to &quot;L. lactis&quot; cause significant economic losses each year by preventing the bacteria from fully metabolizing the milk substrate. Several epidemiologic studies showed the phages mainly responsible for these losses are from the species &quot;936&quot;, &quot;c2&quot;, and &quot;P335&quot; (all from the family Siphoviridae).

The state Assembly of Wisconsin, also the number one cheese-producing state in the United States, voted in 2010 to name this bacterium as the official state microbe; it would have been the first and only such designation by a state legislature in the nation, however the legislation was not adopted by the Senate. The legislation was introduced in November 2009 as Assembly Bill 556 by Representatives Hebl, Vruwink, Williams, Pasch, Danou, and Fields; it was cosponsored by Senator Taylor. The bill passed the Assembly on May 15, 2010, and was dropped by the Senate on April 28.

==Therapeutic benefits==
The feasibility of using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as functional protein delivery vectors has been widely investigated. &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for the delivery of functional proteins because of its noninvasive and nonpathogenic characteristics. Many different expression systems of &quot;L. lactis&quot; have been developed and used for heterologous protein expression.

Lactose fermentation
In one study that sought to prove that some fermentation produced by &quot;L. lactis&quot; can hinder motility in pathogenic bacteria, the motilities of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Vibrio&quot;, and &quot;Leptospira&quot; strains were severely disrupted by lactose utilization on the part of &quot;L. lactis&quot;. Using flagellar &quot;Salmonella&quot; as the experimental group, the research team found that a product of lactose fermentation is the cause of motility impairment in &quot;Salmonella&quot;. It is suggested that the &quot;L. lactis&quot; supernatant mainly affects &quot;Salmonella&quot; motility through disruption of flagellar rotation rather than through irreversible damage to morphology and physiology. Lactose fermentation by &quot;L. lactis&quot; produces acetate that reduces the intracellular pH of &quot;Salmonella&quot;, which in turn slows the rotation of their flagella. These results highlight the potential use of &quot;L. lactis&quot; for preventing infections by multiple bacterial species.

Secretion of Interleukin-10
Genetically engineered &quot;L. lactis&quot; can secrete the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), since IL-10 has a central role in downregulating inflammatory cascades and matrix metalloproteinases. A study by Lothar Steidler and Wolfgang Hans shows that in situ synthesis of IL-10 by genetically engineered &quot;L. lactis&quot; requires much lower doses than systemic treatments like antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or recombinant IL-10.

The authors propose two possible routes by which IL-10 can reach its therapeutic target. Genetically engineered &quot;L. lactis&quot; may produce murine IL-10 in the lumen, and the protein may diffuse to responsive cells in the epithelium or the lamina propria. Another route involves &quot;L. lactis&quot; being taken up by M cells because of its bacterial size and shape, and the major part of the effect may be due to recombinant IL-10 production in situ in intestinal lymphoid tissue. Both routes may involve paracellular transport mechanisms that are enhanced in inflammation. After transport, IL-10 may directly downregulate inflammation. In principle, this method may be useful for intestinal delivery of other protein therapeutics that are unstable or difficult to produce in large quantities and an alternative to the systemic treatment of IBD.

Tumor-suppressor through Tumor metastasis-inhibiting peptide KISS1
Another study, led by Zhang B, created a &quot;L. lactis&quot; strain that maintains a plasmid containing a tumor metastasis-inhibiting peptide known as KISS1. &quot;L. lactis&quot; NZ9000 was demonstrated to be a cell factory for the secretion of biologically active KiSS1 protein, exerting effects on human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells.

KiSS1 secreted from recombinant &quot;L. lactis&quot; strain effectively downregulated the expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9), a crucial key in the invasion, metastasis, and regulation of the signaling pathways controlling tumor cell growth, survival, invasion, inflammation, and angiogenesis. The reason for this is that KiSS1 expressed in &quot;L. lactis&quot; activates the MAPK pathway via GPR54 signaling, suppressing NFκB binding to the MMP-9 promoter and thus downregulating MMP-9 expression. This, in turn, reduces the survival rate, inhibits metastasis, and induces dormancy of cancer cells.

In addition, it was demonstrated that tumor growth can be inhibited by the LAB strain itself, due to the ability of LAB to produce exopolysaccharides. This study shows that &quot;L. lactis&quot; NZ9000 can inhibit HT-29 proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by itself. The success of this strain&#x27;s construction helped to inhibit migration and expansion of cancer cells, showing that the secretion properties of &quot;L. lactis&quot; of this particular peptide may serve as a new tool for cancer therapy in the future.

<doc id="559013" wikidata="Q169965" url="?curid=559013" title="Symphony No. 11 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 11 in G minor, Op. 103 (subtitled The Year 1905), by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in 1957 and premiered by the USSR Symphony Orchestra under Natan Rakhlin on 30 October 1957. The subtitle of the symphony refers to the events of the Russian Revolution of 1905, which the symphony depicts. The first performance given outside the Soviet Union took place in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall on 22 January 1958 when Sir Malcolm Sargent conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The United States premiere was performed by Leopold Stokowski conducting the Houston Symphony on 7 April 1958. The symphony was conceived as a popular piece and proved an instant success in the Soviet Union, his greatest one since the &quot;Leningrad&quot; Symphony fifteen years earlier. The Eleventh Symphony earned him a Lenin Prize in April 1958.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, orchestral bass drum, tam-tam, xylophone, tubular bells, 2 harps (preferably doubled), celesta and strings.

It has become common professional performance practice for the tubular bells part (only used at the conclusion of the fourth movement) to be played on 4 large church bells, each chromatically tuned to the four notes required (G, C, B flat and B natural).

==Structure==

The symphony has four movements played without break, and lasts approximately one hour.
The Eleventh is sometimes dubbed &quot;a film score without the film&quot;. An additional thread is provided by the nine revolutionary songs that appear during the work. Some of these songs date back to the 19th century, others to the year 1905. Shostakovich integrates them into the textures of his symphony. This use of folk and revolutionary songs was a departure from his usual style. They were also songs the composer knew well. His family knew and sang them regularly while he was growing up. In his study of Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonies, Hugh Ottaway praised the Eleventh as one of the great achievements in program music.

==Overview==
===Composition===
Shostakovich originally intended the Eleventh Symphony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and would have written it in 1955. Several personal factors kept him from composing the work until 1957. These factors included his mother&#x27;s death, his tumultuous second marriage and the arrival of many newly freed friends from the Gulag. Events in Hungary in 1956 may have stirred Shostakovich out of his compositional inertia and acted as a catalyst for his writing the symphony.

===Requiem for a generation===
According to the composer&#x27;s son-in-law Yevgeny Chukovsky, the original title sheet for this symphony read not &quot;1905&quot; but &quot;1906&quot;, the year of the composer&#x27;s birth. This causes critics to view the Eleventh Symphony as a requiem not only for the composer himself but for his generation. Still, because the work was composed for the Revolution, its purpose is not lost. The 1905 Revolution was not politicized by the Party, so the piece maintained its romantic aura in the eyes of later generations. Because of this romantic aura, The Eleventh Symphony is among a group of diverse works that embody a spirit of struggle for a just cause, such as Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; and Boris Pasternak&#x27;s narrative poems &quot;1905&quot; and &quot;Lieutenant Schmidt.&quot;

The title, &quot;The Year 1905&quot;, recalls the start of the first Russian Revolution of 1905, which was partially fired by the events on 9 January (9 January by the Julian calendar still in use in Russia at the time, modern date of 22 January 1905) of that year. Some Western critics characterized the symphony as overblown &quot;film music&quot; – in other words, as an agitprop broadsheet lacking both substance and depth.

===Most Mussorgskian symphony===
Shostakovich considered this work his most &quot;Mussorgskian&quot; symphony. He wrote the Eleventh in a simple, direct manner. According to Solomon Volkov, Shostakovich allegedly told him that the symphony was &quot;about the people, who have stopped believing because the cup of evil has run over.&quot;

=== &quot;Testimony&quot; and the Hungarian Revolution ===

In the wake of the publishing of &quot;Testimony&quot;, the Eleventh has attracted speculation over its possible references to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. According to Solomon Volkov, Shostakovich said that the Eleventh Symphony &quot;deals with contemporary themes even though it&#x27;s called &#x27;1905.&#x27;&quot; According to Zoya Tomashevskaya, Shostakovich also allegedly remarked to Igor Belsky not to forget that he &quot;wrote the symphony in the aftermath of (the) Hungarian Uprising&quot;. Shostakovich&#x27;s widow Irina has also said that he had the Hungarian Revolution &quot;in mind&quot; during composition. Extant evidence and the chronology of the symphony&#x27;s composition suggests that this could not have been the case. When Sofia Khentova asked Shostakovich in 1974 whether the Eleventh was a veiled reference to the Hungarian Revolution, he replied: &quot;No, it is 1905, it is Russian history&quot;.

<text>Hugh Williamson (December 5, 1735 – May 22, 1819) was an American Founding Father, physician, and politician. He is best known as a signatory to the U.S. Constitution and for representing North Carolina at the Constitutional Convention.

Williamson was a scholar of international renown. His erudition had brought him into contact with some of the leading intellectuals of the Patriot cause and, in turn, with the ferment of political ideas that eventually found expression in the Constitution. During the American Revolution, Williamson contributed his talents as physician and natural scientist to the American war effort. His experiences in that preeminent event of his generation transformed the genial scholar into an adroit politician and a determined leader in the campaign for effective national government. His leadership was evident not only at the Convention in Philadelphia but also, with telling effect, during the ratification debates in North Carolina.

Williamson&#x27;s career demonstrates the rootlessness that characterized the lives of many Americans even in the 18th century. Born on the frontier, he lived for significant periods of his long life in three different regions of the country. That mobility undoubtedly contributed to the development of his nationalistic outlook, an outlook strengthened by wartime service with interstate military forces and reinforced by the interests of the planters and merchants that formed his North Carolina constituency. His experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation.

==Early years==
Williamson was born in West Nottingham Township, in what was then the frontier region of the Province of Pennsylvania. His fragile health as a youth weighed against his beginning a career in the family&#x27;s clothier business. His parents instead sent him to Francis Alison&#x27;s New London Academy and, in 1754, to the College of Philadelphia (today&#x27;s University of Pennsylvania). Williamson graduated in the school&#x27;s first class, on May 17, 1757, five days before his father died. After teaching at Philadelphia Academy, Williamson studied theology with his West Nottingham neighbor, the Rev. Samuel Finley (later president of the College of New Jersey, today&#x27;s Princeton). He moved to Connecticut and obtained a preacher&#x27;s license but his disillusionment with factional disputes within the Presbyterian Church and a resurgence of ill health led him to abandon a career in the ministry. Upon completing a master&#x27;s degree at Philadelphia in 1760, Williamson joined his alma mater&#x27;s faculty as a professor of mathematics.

In another career shift four years later, Williamson turned to the study of medicine and doctricity. After spending a year at the University of Edinburgh, he matriculated in 1760s at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, wrote a brief thesis, and received his Medical Degree on August 6, 1764. He returned to Philadelphia to open a private practice. At the same time, he pursued a number of independent scientific and educational projects, and his work in these areas eventually led to membership in the American Philosophical Society as well as acclaim in Europe&#x27;s intellectual circles.

Interest in science and education indirectly led Williamson to politics and the Patriot cause. Sailing for England in 1773 to raise funds for a local educational project, Williamson stopped en route at Boston. There he witnessed the famous Boston Tea Party, in which Patriots dressed as American Indians destroyed a cargo of tea in protest over a newly enforced Parliamentary tax on imported commodities. On reaching London he was summoned before the Privy Council to testify on this act of rebellion and on colonial affairs in general.

Williamson came of age politically during this encounter. In response to questions by Council members, who were in the process of formulating punitive measures against Massachusetts, he bluntly warned that repression would provoke rebellion. He then went on to express the argument that was becoming the core of the Patriot position: Americans were entitled to the full rights of Englishmen, including representation in the decisions of the English government. This testimony brought him to the attention of other Americans in London. A mutual interest in scientific matters cemented a solid working relationship with Benjamin Franklin, and Williamson soon found himself joined with the famous American scientist and others in appealing for support among those Englishmen who, in opposition to their own government, sympathized with American claims. 
Williamson continued on to the Netherlands where, taking advantage of the cover afforded by his attendance at meetings on scientific and educational subjects, he organized the publication of pamphlets and other papers that supported the Patriot cause. While there he learned that the colonies had declared their independence. He rushed back to Philadelphia in early 1777 and volunteered for service in the Medical Department of the Continental Army. The department had no opening at that time, so Williamson decided to form a partnership with a younger brother to import medicines and other scarce items from the West Indies through the British blockade. Believing that he could best contribute to the war effort by using his contacts and reputation in this manner, Williamson made Edenton, North Carolina, his base of operations. Settlement in North Carolina soon led to his establishing a medical practice to serve the planters and merchants of the region.

==Military physician==
These various activities brought Williamson to the attention of North Carolina&#x27;s political leaders. Facing the threat of a British invasion of the region from the sea and bases in Florida, the state legislature voted to raise a force of 4,000 men to assist South Carolina. When Governor Richard Caswell, with the rank of major general, took to the field at the head of these citizen-soldiers, he named Williamson to serve as the state&#x27;s Physician and Surgeon General, a post Williamson held until the end of the war.

The siege of Charleston in 1780 marked a stunning defeat for American forces and signaled the end of the first phase in a new British war strategy. Under this strategy British forces would continue to tie down General George Washington&#x27;s main army in the north while a Royal army under General Charles Cornwallis would advance northward. Using Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston as their bases of operations, the British expected their regular units to push through North Carolina and Virginia while a militia composed of local Loyalists secured areas captured by the regular forces. If successful, this strategy would have led to the conquest of the colonies from the south. To counter Cornwallis&#x27; efforts, the Continental Congress sent Horatio Gates to command a small force composed of a division of continentals, Caswell&#x27;s units from North Carolina, and a group of hastily assembled Virginia militia units.

Gates attempted to attack the British advance base near Camden, South Carolina, but his tired militia units, which were still forming when the battle began, were routed, and the Americans suffered another defeat. Williamson, who witnessed the disaster, volunteered to pass behind enemy lines to care for the American wounded. He spent two months on this mercy mission. When smallpox threatened the prison camp, he argued strenuously with Cornwallis and other British officers over the proper method to combat the disease. His perseverance and scientific reputation paid off. The British followed his advice, and an epidemic was averted.

In the fall of 1780 Williamson returned to the field. Major General Nathanael Greene, Gates&#x27; replacement, had begun his brilliant campaign to recover the south through the joint efforts of continentals and militia. While his main force engaged the British in a series of battles, the militiamen concentrated on picking off small outposts and isolated enemy parties. Francis Marion, nicknamed &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;, and others who operated mainly in South Carolina are most remembered for this type of guerrilla warfare, but North Carolina units also adopted these tactics. Williamson was attached to a force under Brigadier General Isaac Gregory whose mission was to limit British activity in eastern North Carolina. Gregory established his base in the vast reaches of the Dismal Swamp where he could pin the British down in Wilmington without jeopardizing his small force. Williamson&#x27;s bold innovations in preventive medicine, especially his strenuous efforts to indoctrinate raw troops in the importance of sanitation and diet, kept the command virtually free of disease during the six months that it inhabited the swamp-—a rare feat in 18th-century warfare.

==Statesman==

In 1782 Williamson was elected to the lower house of the North Carolina legislature, where he served for several terms. He sat on numerous committees, including those formed to regulate veterans&#x27; rights, and he authored the state&#x27;s copyright law. He was chosen to serve in the Continental Congress in 1782. Appointment to this national body represented a natural political progression for Williamson, who was evolving into a champion of federalism. His experiences during the Revolution, especially his exposure to the pressing need for interstate cooperation during the 1780 and 1781 campaigns in the Carolinas, had convinced him of the military importance of strong national government. This interest increased when he came to realize the economic benefits that might accrue from the binding interstate association. In 1786 North Carolina chose Williamson to attend the Annapolis Convention, a meeting called to settle economic questions affecting the middle Atlantic states. Although he arrived too late to play a role in the Maryland proceedings, he was prepared to discuss interstate issues the following year when his state-appointed him as a representative at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.

Williamson, a faithful attendee at Convention sessions, lodged with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, two of the country&#x27;s best-known nationalist leaders. His intellectual stature and international background also propelled him into a leadership role in the North Carolina delegation. A capacity for hard work and his innate good humor made him invaluable to the Federalists as they worked out the many political compromises necessary for consensus on the new instrument of government. On 11 July 1787, James Wilson of Pennsylvania proposed the three fifths compromise. It failed to pass (4:6), but a substantially similar motion was passed two days later. Williamson, like many other Founders, was opposed to the institution of slavery.

Shortly before the Convention adjourned, Williamson wrote a series of public letters in defense of a strong federal system. These &quot;Letters of Sylvius&quot; addressed many of the practical concerns of his state, where the rural and frequently debt-ridden farmers favored minimal government regulations, while the mercantile-planter group from the seaboard region wanted an economy strictly regulated by a central government. Using simple examples, Williamson explained to both groups the dual dangers of inflationary finances and of taxes that would stunt the growth of domestic manufacture. He exhorted North Carolinians to support the Constitution as the basis for their future prosperity. The ratification process, he explained, would decide whether the United States would remain a &quot;system of patchwork and a series of expedients&quot; or become &quot;the most flourishing, independent, and happy nation on the face of the earth.&quot;

Following adjournment in Philadelphia, Williamson returned to New York to participate in the closing sessions of the Continental Congress and to serve as one of the agents settling North Carolina&#x27;s accounts with that body. These duties caused him to miss the Hillsboro Convention, where North Carolina first considered and rejected the Constitution, but he played a major role at a second convention that met in Fayetteville in 1789. Here he participated in a successful effort to rally support for the Constitution.
Williamson was elected to the first federal Congress. He served two terms before retiring and settling in New York City, where he continued to pursue a wide range of scholarly interests. He wrote extensively about his research, joined numerous learned societies, and contributed to many charities. He also served as one of the original trustees of the University of North Carolina.

Thomas Jefferson described Williamson&#x27;s role at the Philadelphia Convention in the following terms: &quot;he was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of a high degree of erudition.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Williamson married Maria Apthorpe in January 1789; she died after the birth of their second child in 1790. They had two sons, both of whom died young (the older one at the age of 22 in 1811, the younger, shortly thereafter, according to Hosack&#x27;s Memoir of Hugh Williamson). Williamson was a Presbyterian, though some sources have identified him as a Deist.

== Death and legacy ==
On May 22, 1819, Williamson died suddenly in New York City, at the age of 83, while driving in his carriage; he was buried in New York City in Trinity Churchyard near the grave of Alexander Hamilton. Williamson County, Tennessee, was named after him, and subsequently Williamson County, Illinois, was named after Williamson County, Tennessee. Williamson Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named after him. Willy Street Coop on Williamson Street in Madison is named for his street. Williamson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.

<text>The following outline is provides an overview of Sikhism, or Sikhi (its endonym).

Sikhism has been described as being either a panentheistic or monotheistic religion—emphasizing universal selflessness and brotherhood—founded in the 15th century upon the teachings of Guru Nanak and the ten succeeding Gurus. It is the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, and one of the fastest-growing.

The sacred text and last Guru of Sikhism, &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, teaches humans how to unite with the all cosmic soul; with God, the creator: &quot;Only those who selflessly love everyone, they alone shall find God.&quot;

==History==

On December 11, 1821, officials from the United States arrived aboard the vessel &quot;Alligator&quot; under the command of Captain Robert F. Stockton at Mesurado Bay. Stockton and Dr. Eli Ayers negotiated to acquire the land in and around the bay from the native chiefs for a settlement by free people of color before sailing to Sierra Leone to pick up these colonists.

On January 7, 1822, free people of color arrived and settled on Providence Island on the Mesurado River under the auspices of the American Colonization Society (ACS), and by April they had moved to the mainland. A Kentucky state affiliate of the ACS was formed in 1828, and members raised money to transport Kentucky blacks—freeborn volunteers as well as slaves set free on the stipulation that they leave the United States—to Africa. The Kentucky society bought a site along the Saint Paul River and named it Kentucky in Africa. Clay-Ashland was the colony&#x27;s main town.

Within the next two decades, approximately 3,200 free people of color arrived in the Montserrado County area from Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Jamaica. As opportunities increased, these people moved through Grand Cape Mount, Bomi County, Montserrado, and Margibi County to seek employment and prosperity. Many of the communities in the county are named for the pioneers who settled the area and their former homes in America.

&quot;The Liberian Herald&quot; began printing in 1830 in Monrovia and was the first newspaper in Liberia. In 1832, the Dey-Golah War erupted between the colonists and the native tribes. There was one battle, with the colonists from Monrovia defeating the Dey and Golah (Gola) combined group. In 1847, the colony declared its independence and Montserrado was the first of the Republic of Liberia&#x27;s counties to sign the Declaration of Independence on July 26, 1847. At the time of creation, the county was composed of three administrative districts in Bomi, Gibi, and Marshall with Monrovia as the county capital. In 1885, the first municipal water supply system was completed in Monrovia.

The first County Inspector was appointed in 1949 by President Tubman, followed by President Tolbert’s appointment of the first County Superintendent in 1973. A railroad was constructed in the mid-1960s from Monrovia&#x27;s port to Todee District by the Bong Mining Company. The Mount Coffee Hydropower Project&#x27;s first phase was completed in 1966. Rubber and palm oil plantations were started in the 1960s and 1970s, while a factory for producing clothing was built in 1979 in Bentol City.

In 1974, the county capital was moved by President Tolbert from Monrovia to his hometown of Bensonville. In 1976, an Assistant Superintendent was added to focus on development in Montserrado County. Bomi Territory in the western portion of the county became Bomi County in 1983. In 1984, Marshall and Gibi territories were combined and became neighboring Margibi County to the east.

Virginia saw the construction of the Unity Conference Center and Hotel Africa in 1979. During the civil strife of the 1980s into the early 2000s much of the county’s infrastructure was looted and left unmaintained. In July 2008, parts of the county received the worst flooding in its recorded history.

The Dandy Warhols were the subject of the 2004 documentary film &quot;Dig!&quot;, along with San Francisco psychedelic outfit The Brian Jonestown Massacre. They have released 12 studio albums, two compilation albums, six EPs, and 27 singles to date.

==Biography==

===Early years (1994–1995)===

The Dandy Warhols were formed in Portland, Oregon in 1994 by Courtney Taylor-Taylor and Peter Holmström. Soon after, drummer Eric Hedford joined, and, following an unsuccessful experiment with Taylor-Taylor&#x27;s girlfriend on bass guitar, Zia McCabe joined the band as keyboardist after Taylor-Taylor saw her working in a coffeehouse. Taylor-Taylor described the band&#x27;s beginning as a group of friends who &quot;needed music to drink to&quot;.

Early in their career, The Dandy Warhols performed in bars throughout Portland and became well known for their nudity-filled live shows. At their first gig in 1994, they were approached by record label Tim/Kerr, who offered to pay for the recording of an album. The result was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Dandys Rule OK&quot;. Musically, &quot;Dandys Rule OK&quot; combined elements of 1960s garage rock, the then-popular Britpop genre, and a shoegaze approach.

===Signing to Capitol and &quot;...The Dandy Warhols Come Down&quot; (1996–1998)===
Major record label Capitol Records were impressed by &quot;Dandys Rule OK&quot;, and decided to sign the band. In 1997, they released their second studio album, &quot;...The Dandy Warhols Come Down&quot;. It was their second attempt at a follow-up album, after their first attempt was rejected by Capitol, who claimed it did not have any &quot;hits&quot;. Three singles were released for &quot;Come Down&quot;, all of which entered the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Being their first record on a major label, &quot;Come Down&quot; featured a more commercial, polished psychedelic and power pop-influenced sound.

In 1998, drummer Eric Hedford left the band after a dispute over royalties, and was replaced by Taylor-Taylor&#x27;s cousin Brent DeBoer.

===&quot;Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia&quot; and mainstream popularity (1998–2001)===
In 2000, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia&quot;. It was a critical and commercial success, due mainly to the single &quot;Bohemian Like You&quot; being featured in a popular Vodafone advertisement as well as on the TV show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The song has also been featured in the animated movie &quot;Flushed Away&quot; in a chase scene, and on the soundtrack album for the film &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot;.

&quot;Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia&quot; featured a less overdriven sound, with less overt psychedelia and more stylings in common with the power pop genre.

Around this time, Taylor-Taylor took out a loan to acquire an industrial warehouse space in northwest Portland, dubbed &quot;The Odditorium&quot; and occupying a quarter city block. The Odditorium is the band&#x27;s eclectic rehearsal space and recording and mixing studio. It also serves as an art space and clubhouse for parties and other events. It opened on November 15, 2001.

===&quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; (2001–2003)===
Becoming a fan of the band after seeing them play at the Glastonbury Festival in 2000, David Bowie personally selected The Dandy Warhols to play at the 2002 Meltdown festival. Bowie and the Dandys played a rendition of The Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; together as an encore to the July 29 gig, which was billed as The New Heathens Night. The band also supported Bowie on his 2003 A Reality Tour.

In September 2001, the band began work on their next studio album. The result was &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;, released in 2003. Produced by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, the album featured a major shift towards a 1980s-influenced synthpop sound.

The album was spearheaded by its first single, &quot;We Used to Be Friends&quot;, which went on to become one of the band&#x27;s most popular tracks, gaining exposure through use as the theme song for the American cult television show &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, as well as an appearance in &quot;The O.C.&quot; Two further singles, &quot;You Were the Last High&quot; and &quot;Plan A&quot;, were released in promotion of the album. This song was also featured in EA Sport FIFA 2004.

===&quot;Dig!&quot;, and other developments (2004)===
Along with band The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols were the subjects of the 2004 documentary film &quot;Dig!&quot;. The film captured a love–hate relationship between the two bands, highlighting the interaction of Taylor-Taylor and BJM frontman Anton Newcombe. It was recorded over the course of seven years by filmmaker Ondi Timoner, and won the Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.

In the same year, the band released a double album, comprising &quot;The Black Album&quot; – the album recorded before &quot;...The Dandy Warhols Come Down&quot; that was rejected by Capitol Records and also dismissed by the band themselves – and &quot;Come on Feel The Dandy Warhols&quot;, a collection of B-sides, cover versions and unreleased songs.

The Dandy Warhols appeared in the 2004 film &quot;9 Songs&quot;, performing a live rendition of the song &quot;You Were the Last High&quot; as one of the film&#x27;s titular &quot;nine songs&quot;.

===&quot;Odditorium or Warlords of Mars&quot; (2004–2007)===

The Dandy Warhols started work on their next studio album in mid-2004. The result was &quot;Odditorium or Warlords of Mars&quot;, released the following year. It was partially named after and recorded in the band&#x27;s own studio, The Odditorium. 

&quot;Odditorium or Warlords of Mars&quot; was largely a return to the psychedelic, guitar-orientated rock of &quot;...The Dandy Warhols Come Down&quot;, moving away from the synth-heavy sound of their previous album, &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Smoke It&quot; and &quot;All the Money or the Simple Life Honey&quot;. The album received a mixed response from music critics.

Around this time, the band contributed to the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse&quot; with a cover of &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; by The Everly Brothers.

On July 17, 2006, the band released a stand-alone single, &quot;Have a Kick Ass Summer (Me and My Friends)&quot;. The song was later re-recorded as &quot;Mis Amigos&quot; for their 2008 album &quot;...Earth to The Dandy Warhols...&quot; It was later featured in the downloadable song pack for the Xbox video game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 4&quot;, and was also re-recorded as &quot;Mis Amigos&quot; for their later album &quot;...Earth to The Dandy Warhols&quot;. In 2007, the band recorded the song &quot;Good Luck Chuck&quot; for the 2007 film of the same name. It was released as a digital single.

===Split with Capitol, Beat the World Records launch (2008)===
In 2007, The Dandy Warhols formed Beat the World Records, a third-party record label of Caroline Records. Portland shoegaze outfit The Upsidedown were signed, followed by independent electropop artist Logan Lynn. In 2008, the band split with long-time record company Capitol Records. Bands Rockers Monstrous, The Hugs, Spindrift and 1776 were signed in the years which followed.

The band covered The Cure&#x27;s song &quot;Primary&quot; for the charity album &quot;Perfect as Cats: A Tribute to The Cure&quot;, released in 2008 on Manimal Vinyl Records, with profits going to Invisible Children, Inc. The band also contributed to the Love and Rockets tribute album &quot;No New Tales to Tell: A Tribute to Love and Rockets&quot; in the same year, covering the song &quot;Inside the Outside&quot;.

===&quot;...Earth to The Dandy Warhols...&quot;, Beat the World Records roster (2008–2010)===

In 2008, The Dandy Warhols released their sixth studio album, &quot;...Earth to The Dandy Warhols...&quot;. It was the first official release on Beat the World. Shortly thereafter, they put out an EP, &quot;Earth to the Remix E.P. Volume One&quot;, consisting of electronic remixed versions of tracks from &quot;...Earth...&quot; as well as &quot;Earth to the Remix E.P. Volume Two&quot;. The label also released Logan Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Feed Me to the Wolves&quot; EP and a full-length album from The Upsidedown.

Also in 2008, The Dandy Warhols announced they were releasing a collaborative album called &quot;Breathe Easy&quot; to benefit conservation projects. The recordings, which started on October 21, 2008, took place at the band&#x27;s Odditorium studio. They collaborated with bands such as The Bravery, The Kooks, Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s J Mascis and Spoon. Not much is known about the status of the project, and recordings are not readily available.

Logan Lynn released his critically acclaimed album &quot;From Pillar to Post&quot; on Beat the World in September 2009.

In November 2009, The Dandy Warhols released a cover of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Blackbird&quot; in tribute to the death of Michael Jackson. This references the lyrics of their 2003 song &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;: &quot;When Michael Jackson dies/We&#x27;re covering Blackbird&quot;.

In an interview from 2010 with the Australian &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; tabloid newspaper, Taylor-Taylor was quoted as saying: &quot;We&#x27;re terrible at business, terrible. We don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s like trying to have children run a household. We need to hook up with some indie label.&quot; In an interview with German magazine Catch Fire from later that same year, Logan Lynn is quoted as saying, &quot;I love the Warhols and everybody had really great intentions going in but ... No radio, no real distribution, no licensing, no PR. Without those things in place, artists fail ... and my last record fell victim to that.&quot; Monstrous, The Hugs and Spindrift never officially released anything on Beat the World.

===&quot;The Capitol Years&quot;, split with Caroline/EMI, signing with The End Records===
In 2010, The Dandy Warhols released &quot;The Capitol Years 1995–2007&quot;, a greatest hits album chronicling the band&#x27;s years with Capitol Records. In addition to containing popular singles and songs from their Capitol albums, it also included a few alternative mixes as well as a new track, &quot;This Is the Tide&quot;. The song debuted on Australian radio station Triple J on June 18, 2010. Three different music videos were released for the song.

Beat the World Records cut ties with Caroline Records in 2010 and began working with The End Records in 2011. 1776 released their debut album on Beat the World in 2011.

===&quot;This Machine&quot; (2011–2013)===

That same year, the band announced they were recording a new album. While playing in Sydney&#x27;s Enmore Theatre in May 2011 as part of their 2011 Australian tour, lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor announced the new album would be titled &quot;This Machine&quot; (after previously jokingly that it would be called either &quot;The Pastor of Muppets&quot;, &quot;Shitty Shitty Band Band&quot; or &quot;Whirled Piece&quot; in blog posts on the band&#x27;s official website). On the same tour, the band debuted two new tracks from the album, &quot;Seti vs. the Wow! Signal&quot; and &quot;Rest Your Head&quot;.

The Dandy Warhols &quot;re-arranged and performed&quot; the theme music to the popular science-based television show &quot;MythBusters&quot;. The updated theme music first appeared midway through the 2011 season, in the episode &quot;Bikes and Bazookas&quot;. This subsequent theme was a revamp of the original and was used until the show had an overhaul starting in the 2015 season (thereby discontinuing the theme at the end of the 2014 season).

The band announced the release of the new album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Well They&#x27;re Gone&quot;, on March 1, 2012, allowing visitors to download the track for free after entering their email address. A video for the track &quot;Sad Vacation&quot; was released on April 16.

&quot;This Machine&quot; was released on April 24, 2012. The album featured a collaboration with David J on the track &quot;Autumn Carnival&quot;. It was seen as a more musically stripped-back and reserved album in comparison to their previous records.

===&quot;Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia Live at the Wonder&quot;, &quot;Distortland&quot; and &quot;Why You So Crazy&quot; (2014–present)===

On January 28, 2014, The Dandy Warhols announced plans to release their first live album, which was recorded at The Wonder Ballroom during the band&#x27;s thirteenth anniversary tour of &quot;Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia&quot;. The album, entitled &quot;Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia Live at the Wonder&quot;, was released on March 25, 2014.

The band released the single &quot;Chauncey P vs. All the Girls in London&quot; in March 2015.

On January 29, 2016, the band announced their ninth studio album, &quot;Distortland&quot;. It was their first release for Dine Alone Records. It was released on April 8, 2016, in time for their promotional tour starting in the United States. The track &quot;You Are Killing Me&quot; was released as a single. A music video was produced featuring noted Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro.

On February 11, 2017, the band released a new single, &quot;Thick Girls Knock Me Out (Richard Starkey)&quot;, to streaming services. The band has returned to the studio after the end of the promotional tour for &quot;Distortland&quot; and intends to spend the rest of the year recording new material.

On October 12, 2018 The Dandy Warhols released a collaboration with Logan Lynn titled “Like Before”, which appeared on Lynn’s multi-media double album &quot;My Movie Star&quot;, produced by Jay Mohr. On October 24, 2018, the band released a new single, &quot;Forever&quot;, to streaming services. This is the first single off their 10th studio album, released in January 2019, titled &quot;Why You So Crazy&quot;. Two more singles preceded its release, &quot;Be Alright&quot; and &quot;Motor City Steel&quot;. During the same month, the band started their 25th anniversary tour with a string of dates in Europe &amp; UK. 

In May 2023, the (digital) EP &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was released. The title track, originally written by Gordon Lightfoot, was a leftover for the 2004 Black Album sessions. The other two tracks, Untitled 1 and Alien, remained unreleased at the time.

IWNSLY is the title of the track released in July 2023. The song is a collaboration with Debbie Harry and NALA.

<text>William Samuel Johnson (October 7, 1727 – November 14, 1819) was an American Founding Father and statesman. He attended all of the four founding American Congresses: the Stamp Act Congress in 1765, the Congress of the Confederation in 1785–1787, the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787 where he was chairman of the Committee of Style that drafted the final version of the United States Constitution, and as a senator from Connecticut in the first United States Congress in 1789-1791. He also served as the third president of Columbia University (then known as Columbia College).

==Early life==

William Samuel Johnson was born in Stratford, Connecticut, on October 7, 1727, to Samuel Johnson, a well-known Anglican clergyman, educator, and later president of King&#x27;s College, and Johnson&#x27;s first wife, Charity Floyd Nicoll. Johnson received his primary education from his father who ran a small Stratford Academy boarding students. He then graduated from Yale College in 1744, winning the George Berkely Scholarship. He went on to receive a master&#x27;s degree from Yale in 1747 and an honorary degree from Harvard the same year. He would later receive an honorary master&#x27;s from King&#x27;s College in 1761 and a Doctorate of Law from Oxford in 1766.

==Career==
Although his father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided instead to pursue a legal career. Self-educated in the law, he quickly developed an important clientele and established business connections extending beyond the boundaries of his native colony and was frequently consulted on inter-colony legal issues. He also held a commission in the Connecticut colonial militia for over 20 years, rising from ensign to the rank of colonel. He served in the lower house (1761 and 1765) and the upper house (1766 and 1771–1775) of the Connecticut Legislature.

Johnson was first attracted to the Patriot cause by what he and his associates considered Parliament&#x27;s unwarranted interference in the government of the colonies. At this time he was somewhat of a radical, writing about “chains and shackles,” “stamps and slavery,” and the “late fatal acts” that would reduce America to “Roman provinces in the time of the Caesar.” He started forming alliances with the Connecticut Son&#x27;s of Liberty and working against the re-election of Loyalist Governor Thomas Fitch.

He was elected one of three delegates from Connecticut to the Stamp Act Congress, where in 1765 he served on the committee defining the rights of British Colonists arguing the right of the colonies to decide tax policies for themselves. According to his biographer Beardsley, Johnson &quot;was a guiding and controlling spirit in the Assembly.&quot; He authored the seminal &quot;Report of Committee at Congress on Colonia Rights,&quot; that evolved into the &quot;Stamp Act Declaration of Rights and Grievances,&quot; the final version of which is in his hand. He was also on the committee that authored the &quot;Petition to the King&quot;.

The declaration, petitions, and pressure from London merchants forced Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act in 1766. But that year, Connecticut faced a new problem with a seventy year old unsettled legal case involving Mohegan Indians lands. The British wanted to use the case as a pretext to cancel Connecticut&#x27;s Royal Charter of 1662. Johnson agreed to become a special Colonial Agent to fight the case. Johnson left his family, his political career, and his legal practice to argue in London for Connecticut&#x27;s charter, where he lived from 1767 to 1771.

===American Revolution===

While a Colonial Agent he sharply criticized British policy toward the colonies. His experience in Britain convinced him that Britain&#x27;s policy was shaped more by ignorance of American conditions, not through the sinister designs of a wicked government, as many Patriots alleged. As the Patriots became more radical in their demands, Johnson found it difficult to commit himself wholeheartedly to the cause. Although he believed British policy unwise, he found it difficult to break his own connections with the mother country. A scholar of international renown, he had many friends in Britain and among the British and American Loyalists. The English author Samuel Johnson said of him, &quot;Of all those whom the various accidents of life have brought within my notice, there is scarce anyone whose acquaintance I have more desired to cultivate than yours.&quot; He was also bound to Britain by religious and professional ties. He enjoyed close associations with the Anglican Church in England and with the scholarly community at Oxford, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1766.

Fearing the consequences of independence for both the colonies and the mother country, Johnson sought to avoid extremism and to reach a compromise on the outstanding political differences between the protagonists. However, his court case against the British government that was supposed to take a few months was dragged out for five years, during which time he was away from his family, lost his law firm&#x27;s clients, and received little thanks, little reward, and endured criticism for his association with the British. He returned home late in 1771, just in time to spend three months with his father before he died. He was appointed a member of the colony&#x27;s Supreme Court (1772–1774).

He was elected as a delegate in 1774 to the Continental Congress but turned down the honor in favor of his protégée Roger Sherman. The Connecticut assembly, after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, over his strong personal objections, sent him on a dangerous visit through both Patriot Massachusetts militia and British army lines in Boston to the British commander General Thomas Gage to negotiate an end to the fighting by making a separate peace with the British. He succeeded, but on returning back across the lines again to Connecticut, he found the Assembly had changed their mind, voted for war, then adjourned, leaving no instructions for Johnson. Even after the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;, he believed that the American Revolution was not necessary and that independence would be bad for everyone concerned. He retired from the Assembly, and from his law practice. In July, 1779, after Tryon&#x27;s raid on the Connecticut shoreline burnt down the towns of Fairfield and Norwalk, the panicking citizens of Stratford begged him to intercede with General Tyron and save their town. He declined to undertake yet another dangerous mission he opposed, but a town meeting was called and resolutions were passed insisting he should visit Tyron. A committee was appointed to accompany him, and a subscription paper implying Johnson supported the peace effort was printed without Johnson&#x27;s approval. The paper was seized on by his political enemies, leading to his arrest for communicating with the enemy, but the charges were soon dropped.

===New nation===
Once independence was achieved, Johnson felt free to participate in the government of the new nation. He resumed the practice of his profession, and some time subsequent to the declaration of peace was reinstated in his old office as a member of the Upper House of the General Assembly, where he also served as a legal counsel for Connecticut in its dispute with Pennsylvania over western lands (1779-80). He was appointed as a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation (1785–1787). His influence there was recognized by his contemporaries. Jeremiah Wadsworth wrote of him to a friend, &quot;Dr. Johnson has, I believe, much more influence than either you or myself. The Southern Delegates are vastly fond of him.&quot; In 1785, the Vermont Republic granted Johnson a town in the former King&#x27;s College Tract in thanks for representing the interests of Vermont before the Congress of the Confederation. The town of Johnson, Vermont; the former Johnson State College; and Johnson Street in Madison, Wisconsin, bear his name.

===Constitutional Convention===
In 1787, Johnson played a major role as one of the Philadelphia Convention&#x27;s delegates. His eloquent speeches on the subject of representation carried great weight during the debate. He looked to a strong federal government to protect the rights of Connecticut and the other small states from encroachment by their more powerful neighbors. He supported the New Jersey Plan, which called for equal representation of the states in the national legislature.

In general, he favored extension of federal authority. He argued that the judicial power &quot;ought to extend to equity as well as law&quot; (the words &quot;in law and equity&quot; were adopted at his motion). He denied that there could be treason against a separate state since sovereignty was &quot;in the Union.&quot; He opposed prohibition of any ex post facto law, which made an act a criminal offense retroactively, because he considered that such a prohibition implied &quot;an improper suspicion of the National Legislature.&quot;

Johnson was influential even in the final stages of framing the Constitution. He gave his fullest support to the Connecticut Compromise, which foreshadowed the final Great Compromise, with a national legislature with a Senate that provided equal representation for all states and a House of Representatives based on population. He also served on and chaired the five-member Committee of Style, which framed the final form of the document.

In her 1966 book, &quot;Miracle at Philadelphia&quot;, Catherine Drinker Bowen calls Johnson &quot;the perfect man to preside over these four masters of argument and political strategy [i.e. fellow committee members Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Rufus King]... His presence on the committee must have been reassuring; the doctor&#x27;s quiet manner disarmed.&quot;

<text>Vytautas Landsbergis (; born 18 October 1932) is a Lithuanian politician and former Member of the European Parliament. He was the first Speaker of Reconstituent Seimas of Lithuania after its independence declaration from the Soviet Union. He has written 20 books on a variety of topics, including a biography of Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis, as well as works on politics and music. He is a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration, and a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

== Biography ==
Vytautas Landsbergis, member of an old German Landsberg family, was born in Kaunas, Lithuania. His father was the architect Vytautas Landsbergis-Žemkalnis. His mother, ophthalmologist Dr. Ona Jablonskytė-Landsbergienė, assisted her sister&#x27;s family in sheltering a Jewish child, Avivit Kissin, from the Holocaust. She brought Kissin to her sister&#x27;s home and produced a forged birth certificate with a Lithuanian for Kissin. Her sister and brother-in-law were named Righteous Among the Nations. Jablonskytė-Landsbergienė was also named as Righteous Among the Nations for her efforts to help hide a 16-year old Jewish girl named Bella Gurvich (later Rozenberg).

In 1952 he placed third in the Lithuanian chess championship, after Ratmir Kholmov and Vladas Mikėnas. In 1955, he graduated from the Lithuanian Conservatory of Music (now Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre). In 1969, he wrote his thesis for his PhD degree. In 1978, he became a professor at the Lithuanian Conservatory. From 1978 to 1990, he was a professor at both the Lithuanian Conservatory and the Vilnius Pedagogical University. In 1994, he wrote a thesis for his doctor habilitus degree.

== Family ==
Landsbergis was married to Gražina Ručytė-Landsbergienė (1930–2020), who was a well-known Lithuanian pianist and associate Professor of the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theater. His daughters Jūratė and Birutė are also musicians. His son, Vytautas, is a well-known Lithuanian writer and film director. His grandson Gabrielius Landsbergis (b. 1982) is the former (2015-2024) leader of the conservative party, a former member of Lithuanian Parliament and the former Foreign Minister of Lithuania.

== Political career ==
Landsbergis entered politics, in 1988, as one of the founders of Sąjūdis, the Lithuanian pro-independence political movement. In 1989 elections to the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union, Landsbergis was elected as one of the People&#x27;s Deputies from Lithuanian SSR. After Sąjūdis&#x27; victory in the 1990 elections, he became the Chairman of the Supreme Council of Lithuania.

On 11 March 1990, he headed the Parliamentary session during which the restoration of Lithuanian independence from the Soviet Union was declared. Lithuania became the first Soviet Republic to do so. According to the Temporary Primary Law (&quot;de facto&quot; temporary Constitution, until the permanent Constitution comes to power) of Lithuania, Landsbergis was both: the highest officer of State and the Speaker of the Parliament. He held this post from March 1990 until the next elections in November 1992.

The Soviet Union attempted to stifle this activity by economic blockade in 1990, but it failed, and other Soviet Republics soon followed suit and declared their independence from Moscow, as well. He was also extremely dubious of the view that Mikhail Gorbachev was trying to liberalize the Soviet Union and that Lithuania should not prevent him from doing so. Landsbergis also played a crucial role during the confrontation between the Lithuanian independence movement and Soviet armed forces in January 1991. Iceland was the first state that officially recognized the restoration of Lithuanian independence; Landsbergis was somewhat critical of certain Western powers (such as the United States and United Kingdom) for not showing enough support in Lithuania&#x27;s bid to restore its independence after more than 40 years of Soviet occupation, although he did accept the recommendation from his government that the newly independent Lithuania immediately seek to establish full diplomatic relations with the UK and US.

In 1993, Landsbergis led much of Sąjūdis into a new political party, the Homeland Union (&quot;Tėvynės Sąjunga&quot;). It gained a landslide victory in the 1996 parliamentary elections. Landsbergis served as Speaker of the Seimas from 1996 until 2000. He ran, although unsuccessfully, for president in 1997 (coming up the third after receiving 15.9% of the votes). During the runoff, he supported Valdas Adamkus, who had finished second in the first round. Adamkus eventually became president.

In 2004, Landsbergis was elected by Lithuanian voters to the European Parliament in Brussels (the total number of MEPs from Lithuania in Brussels was 13), and has been returned at every election until 2014.

In 2005, Landsbergis became an international patron of the newly formed Henry Jackson Society.

Since 2015 Landsbergis is together with Roswitha Fessler-Ketteler, MEP Heidi Hautala, Aleksi Malmberg and Frank Schwalba-Hoth member of the advisory board of the Caucasian Chamber Orchestra association and its German &quot;Förderverein&quot;.

==Attempt to ban Communist and Nazi insignia==
In January 2005, Landsbergis, backed by Member of the European Parliament from Hungary Jozsef Szajer, urged that Communist symbols be banned in the European Union, in addition to Nazi symbols. He also sent a letter to Franco Frattini, the European Commissioner of Justice and Internal Affairs, suggesting that in case the EU decides to ban Nazi symbols, Communist symbols should be banned too. The Commissioner became interested in this proposal and said: &quot;I am ready to join this discussion. The Communist dictatorships no less than the Nazi ones are responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people&quot;. A bit later, however, the Commissioner decided that he would not attempt to ban any symbols, as there was no agreement as to which symbols should be banned.

Landsbergis&#x27;s proposal caused quite a stir in Italy, where leftists strongly protested such a move. The Communist Refoundation Party and Party of Italian Communists were outraged at the proposal. It became the center of Italian media&#x27;s attention. One of the most influential Italian dailies, &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, published an interview with Landsbergis outlining his proposal. It was the first time the daily allocated a full page to a politician from Lithuania.

Landsbergis&#x27;s proposal found few supporters among Italian politicians. One was Alessandra Mussolini, a granddaughter of former Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who commented: &quot;To implement the proposal of the Members of the European Parliament regarding Communist symbols is our moral duty&quot;.

Landsbergis&#x27;s proposal was opposed by the Russian Parliament as well. The First Vicespeaker of the Russian State Duma called the proposal &quot;abnormal&quot;. Another Russian MP, a communist, commented that &quot;somebody in Europe became insolent and forgot who saved them from the fascists&quot;.

The debate came to an end when, in the beginning of February 2005, the European Commission rejected calls for a proposed Europe-wide ban on Nazi symbols to be extended to cover Communist Party symbols as well. Frattini said it would not be appropriate to include the red star and the hammer and sickle in a draft EU law on racism.

Finally, at the end of February 2005, the European Union dropped proposals to ban Nazi symbols across its 25 member states. Luxembourg withdrew the plan when it became clear that members could not reach a consensus on which symbols to ban. There were also concerns that the proposed ban was a threat to freedom of expression.

Landsbergis is a fierce critic of Russia&#x27;s intentions to impose any kind of influence on the Baltic states and publicly questions Russia&#x27;s actions vis-à-vis the Baltic States on both local and international media, as well as in the European Parliament. He warns that Russia might have intentions to control Lithuania and the other Baltic States economically and politically through a wide network of former KGB agents and other clandestine activities. Landsbergis is one of the most active politicians who urge Russia to compensate Lithuania and other post-Soviet republics for damage done to them during their occupations.
==Controversies==

=== Comments on Vilnius street and memorial renaming controversy ===
In 2019, Vilnius&#x27;s mayor, Remigijus Šimašius, renamed a street that had been named after Kazys Skirpa (who formed the Lithuanian Activist Front, which massacred Jews across Lithuania) and removed a memorial to Jonas Noreika (who ordered and oversaw the killings of Lithuanian Jews in Plungė during the Plungė massacre). Landsbergis posted a poem on social media that referred to the Virgin Mary as a &quot;žydelka&quot; (&quot;jew-girl&quot;), and Faina Kukliansky, chair of the Jewish Community of Lithuania, condemned it. Landsbergis said the poem was an attempt to show the ignorance of Lithuanian antisemites and requested support from &quot;at least one smart and brave Jew ... who does not agree with Simasius.&quot;

=== Recognition as the head of state of Lithuania ===
The question of whether V. Landsbergis should be officially acknowledged as the head of state of Lithuania from 1990 to 1992 has been polarising the Lithuanian public for many years. On 25 June 2022, the Lithuanian Seimas officially approved the bill regarding V. Landsbergis&#x27; recognition as the head of state. &quot;The bill is a symbol of respect and acknowledgement of a person who played a significant role in Lithuania’s history,&quot; the Speaker of Seimas, V. Čmilytė-Nielsen, said. The opposition claimed that such a step was a &quot;falsification of history&quot; as the Provisional Constitution along with other historical records state that &quot;[t]he functions of the head of state during the transitional period remain with the collegial Parliament body—the Presidium of the Supreme Council of Lithuania.&quot; The latter was a collective political entity consisting of 11 deputies possessing equal powers, which was disbanded on 22 November 1992, when the current Constitution of Lithuania was adopted. The decision made by Seimas proved to be unpopular among the public. According to one survey done by &quot;Lietuvos rytas&quot;, 68% of respondents disagree with such an initiative with 42% of them believing that it is baseless and 26% doubting its validity. On 30 June 2022, Vytautas Landsbergis was officially recognized as the first post-soviet Lithuania&#x27;s head of state. &quot;Should I be congratulated? I don&#x27;t know... Lithuania is the one that should be congratulated more as it is finally on a par with Estonia. Estonia has already sorted it out in a way that Arnold Rüütel was President since March of 1990,&quot; V. Landsbergis commented. The opposition threatened to renounce Landsbergis&#x27; status as the head of state in the next parliamentary elections.

<text>Anna Elizabeth Burke (born 1 January 1966) is an Australian former politician who served as the 28th speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from October 2012 to August 2013, and was Acting Speaker from May to October 2012. A member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), she was the member of parliament (MP) for the division of Chisholm from 1998 to 2016.

Burke was a trade union representative before being selected by the Australian Labor Party to stand for the seat of Chisholm in 1998. She served as deputy speaker of the Australian House of Representatives twice from 2008 to 2010 and again from 2011 until the resignation of Speaker Peter Slipper due to allegations of fraud and sexual harassment in 2012. She was the second woman to become Speaker and held the office until the 2013 federal election, in which the Rudd government was defeated.

While in parliament, both as a member of the government and the opposition, Burke campaigned against offshore processing and mandatory detention of refugees, policies all of the major parties supported at the time. Burke retired from politics at the 2016 federal election. She is a current member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and an Officer of the Order of Australia. Since leaving politics, Burke has also served on the boards of several foundations and companies.

==Early life and education==
Anna Elizabeth Burke was born on 1 January 1966 in Melbourne and was one of five children. Her father was an electrician and her mother a was kindergarten teacher.

Burke attended Presentation College, Windsor, and was diagnosed with dyslexia in grade 5, which led to her taking her high-school exams orally. In 1988, she graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours in English Literature, and in 1994, she graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Master of Commerce with Honours in Industrial Relations and Human Resource Management.

== Career ==
Before entering politics, Anna Burke worked as a trade union official and a human resources manager. In these capacities, she worked for VicRoads from 1988 to 1993 and for Victoria University (then the Victorian Institute of Technology) from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, Burke joined the Finance Sector Union as National Industrial Officer, and was responsible for coordinating campaigns and being a spokesperson.

=== Entry into politics ===
In 1996, Burke joined the Ashwood branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and in 1997, the ALP selected her as an electoral candidate for the Division of Chisholm, which was then held by Liberal Minister for Health and Family Services Michael Wooldridge, who had held it for more that 11 years. Burke was not expected to win the seat but after Wooldridge switched to the Division of Casey, she won the seat at the 1998 federal election against the Liberal Paty candidate Peter Vlahos with a 4.67% swing to Labor (2PP).

=== Time in parliament ===
In 2005, Anna Burke submitted a private member&#x27;s bill to the house that proposed an early form of the subsequently created Do Not Call Register, which allows people with fixed telephone lines to opt out from telemarketing. After Labor&#x27;s win at the 2007 federal election, Burke was elected as Deputy Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, who presides over the House in the Speaker&#x27;s absence. In February 2008, just a few sitting days into the Parliament, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was absent from the House while he was visiting flood victims in Mackay, Queensland. To protest Rudd&#x27;s absence, the Opposition took a cardboard cut-out of Rudd into the chamber. Burke requested the &quot;offensive article&quot; be removed from the House, which caused some laughter from the opposition, along with the Member for Cowper Luke Hartsuyker. Hartsuyker refused to leave the house, causing Burke to suspend the sitting of parliament. While Deputy Speaker, Burke argued for the banning of websites that promote eating disorders but was not successful. Burke continued to advocate for awareness of eating disorders throughout her time in parliament.

In 2011, Speaker Harry Jenkins announced his resignation from the Speakership, saying he wanted to be more involved in Labor Party matters as a backbencher. The government nominated Peter Slipper, the member for the Division of Fisher, to become Speaker. In response, the Manager of Opposition Business Christopher Pyne nominated a number of government members to become Speaker, starting with Burke. All nominated government members declined their nominations. Slipper accepted his nomination and took the chair as Speaker. On the same day, Burke accepted the Government&#x27;s nomination for the position of Deputy Speaker and was elected to that position in a ballot.

In April 2012, Slipper announced he was standing aside, meaning he would remain Speaker but would not attend sessions of the House until fraud allegations made against him were resolved. The Opposition called for Slipper to stay away from the chamber until sexual harassment charges were resolved as well. In October 2012, Slipper resigned as Speaker of the House. Later that evening, Burke was nominated and elected the new Speaker of the House of Representatives unopposed, becoming the second woman to hold the position after Joan Child. As Speaker, Burke instructed members not to refer to her as &quot;Madam Speaker&quot; but rather as &quot;Speaker&quot;. This precedent was not followed by her successor Bronwyn Bishop, who requested to be called &quot;Madam Speaker&quot;. Burke also gained a reputation as &quot;straight-talking&quot; and for using a &quot;death stare&quot; as Speaker.

In May 2012, Labor-turned-independent Member of Parliament Craig Thomson, who was embattled with the Health Services Union expenses affair, unexpectedly sided with the Opposition during a parliamentary division. To avoid accepting the &quot;tainted vote&quot; of Thomson, several Opposition members, including the leader Tony Abbott, ran for the doors. Burke had already asked for the doors to be locked so members were prevented from leaving the chamber. While Speaker, Burke unsuccessfully called for a national ban on child beauty pageants. In August 2012, Burke invoked Standing Order 94A to eject Abbott from the House for one hour for refusing to withdraw a statement &quot;without qualification&quot;. The ejection of an opposition leader was rare and had not occurred since the ejection of John Howard in 1986, and has not happened again since. In 2013, people in the public gallery interrupted question time several times by calling Prime Minister Julia Gillard a liar. This led to Burke stating: &quot;This is Question Time. It is not a football match&quot;, and several individuals were removed from the gallery. In August 2013, Burke&#x27;s Melbourne electorate office was vandalised with graffiti that said &quot;fre [sic] the refugees&quot; and the windows were smashed in protest of the federal government&#x27;s policy on asylum seekers. Opposition finance spokesperson Andrew Robb&#x27;s nearby office was similarly vandalised.

In the 2013 federal election, Burke suffered a 4.18% swing (2PP) against her in Chisholm but was re-elected with 51.6% of the 2PP vote. Her tenure as Speaker ended with the defeat of the Rudd government, after which the incoming Abbott government appointed Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker. Burke then sought to become chief Opposition whip in the Bill Shorten–led Opposition but was not successful. Burke stated she had been unsuccessful in being appointed to the frontbench because of factional manoeuvring and that Labor had &quot;failed women&quot; by not appointing ministers based on merit, overlooking qualified women. In 2014, Burke appeared on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC) panel show &quot;Q+A&quot;, which was disrupted by protesters unfurling a banner and voicing criticism of education minister Christopher Pyne. In 2015, Burke announced she would not re-contest her seat at the 2016 federal election. She was replaced as the Member for Chisholm by Liberal MP Julia Banks, who was the only Liberal–National Coalition candidate to win a seat held by an opposition party in 2016.

=== Career after politics ===
Anna Burke&#x27;s official portrait as Speaker of the House was painted in 2015 by Sydney artist Jude Rae, making it the first portrait in Parliament&#x27;s Historical Memorials Collection that both depicts and was painted by a woman. The portrait was unveiled at Parliament House, Canberra, in 2017. In the 2019 Australia Day Honours, Burke was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly as Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to the community&quot;.

From 2016 to 2018, Burke served as the chair of Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia. , Burke is a board member of the Institute for Breathing and Sleep since 2016, a board member of RedR Australia since 2018, and chair of the Monash University Accident Research Centre since 2019.

In 2017, Burke was appointed a full-time member of the General, Freedom of Information, and Veterans&#x27; Appeals Divisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where her term is due to end in 2024. In 2024, Burke was the lead decision-maker on a case involving a New Zealand-born man referred to as CHCY, who had his visa cancelled due to being convicted for child sexual abuse. The AAT overturned the cancellation of CHCY&#x27;s visa, stating that CHCY should be allowed to stay in Australia due to his ties to the community, and that his wife and children would move to New Zealand with him were he to be deported, and that the victim in this case had moved to New Zealand already.

== Political beliefs ==

=== Refugee policy ===
Burke is an outspoken critic of Labor policy on asylum seekers. She is an opponent of offshore detention, a policy that was supported by all major parties during her time in parliament. Burke opposed the Gillard Government&#x27;s Malaysian Solution, a deal by which Malaysia would accept 800 asylum seekers from Australia. Burke stated she felt &quot;deeply uneasy with the [government&#x27;s] approach&quot; of using Manus Island as an offshore detention site, and that she was &quot;not in favour of mandatory detention, particularly of women and children&quot;. She added her role as Speaker prevented her from strongly advocating on this matter in parliament. In 2013, in a discussion of refugee policy at a community forum in her electorate, Burke said she &quot;sometimes wondered [why she ran for the Labor party]&quot;. In 2014, following the death of an asylum seeker in Australian detention on Manus Island, Burke wrote an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; to call for a total end to offshore detention. Together with fellow Labor parliamentarian Melissa Parke, Burke tabled a motion at ALP caucus in 2014 to cease the transfer of asylum seekers to Manus Island and Nauru, and to close the detention centres there. The motion was defeated. In 2016, Burke joined a working group that included Members of Parliament and religious leaders to formulate new policy on asylum seekers. Responding to Burke&#x27;s announcement of her retirement from parliament in 2016, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten described Burke as a &quot;fearless and tireless advocate for the rights of asylum seekers&quot;. In her parliamentary valedictory speech, Burke described offshore detention centres as a &quot;festering wound&quot;.

=== Food allergies ===
Because her son has a severe peanut allergy, Burke became interested in policy on food allergies. In 2014, Burke proposed the creation of a National Allergen register, and in 2015, she established the Parliamentary Allergy Alliance in cooperation with Australian Greens leader Richard Di Natale and ALP MP Tony Zappia.

==Personal life==

In 1994, Burke married Stephen Burgess. The couple have two children; in 1999, when her first child was born, Burke became the second woman to give birth while a sitting Member of the Australian Parliament. Burke had her second child in 2002.

<text>The Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE) is the local bus system serving Nassau County, New York. It also serves parts of western Suffolk County, New York as well as eastern portions of the New York City borough of Queens. It was formerly operated under the name of MTA Long Island Bus (the public name of the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority) – a division of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The MTA took over the operation of county buses in 1973 from ten private bus companies. In 2011, the owner, Nassau County, decided to outsource the system to a private operator, Veolia Transport, due to a funding dispute with the MTA.

==History==
===Private companies (pre-1973)===
On February 20, 1967, at the request of Nassau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson, County Supervisor Michael N. Petito introduced legislation to the Board of Supervisors to allow the county to takeover operation of 17 private bus companies serving it. County operation was last considered in 1963.

On August 22, 1970, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) authorized Hempstead Bus Corporation, Schenck Transportation, Rockville Centre Bus Company, and Stage Coach Lines to take over the routes operated by Semke Bus Lines and Mid Island Transit effective August 24. Those two companies had ended operations on August 14 after the PSC had denied their requests to increase fares from 20 to 35 cents.

On April 13, 1971, the president of Hempstead Bus sent a letter to Nassau County Executive Ralph G. Caso saying that it might have to significantly reduce service, noting increasing costs for materials and labor, competition from cars, and the high interest rates needed to finance the 20 new buses it placed into service in August 1970. One of the routes that might need to be cut was an experimental route set up on August 21 between county office buildings in Mineola and the South Shore. Caso announced an agreement with the company on April 23 in which the county would purchase the 20 new buses the company had acquired in 1970 and lease them back to the company, which would have to repay the county within five years.

On May 22, 1971, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Chairman William J. Ronan committed to Caso that the MTA would conduct a thorough study of Nassau&#x27;s bus transportation needs, focusing on cross-county routes, and routes that feed Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) stations. On August 20, 1971, Caso announced an agreement with the MTA to seek $500,000 from the state&#x27;s supplemental budget to push off Stage Coach Lines&#x27; planned abandonment of its four routes, primarily to the Mid-Island Shopping Plaza that were set to begin that weekend. Schenck also planned to make cuts in evening and weekend service on September 1, 1971. Under the agreement, it would not make those cuts, and would take over Stage Coach&#x27;s routes.

In his State of the County speech on February 7, 1972, Caso recommended having the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) take over the operations of some of the county&#x27;s bus companies, and said a formal request to the MTA for a takeover would be made within 90 days. In April 1972, Schenck filed with the New York State Department of Transportation for a fare increase of about 30 percent, or 10 cents a zone for the first two fare zones, to take effect on July 3, 1973. The one-zone fare would go from 35 to 45 cents, and the two-zone fare would go from 50 to 60 cents, while three-zone trips would stay at 75 cents. The increase would replace state and county subsidies that were in place for the previous 18 months. The county was providing $256,000 for six months through June 30, while the state was providing $400,000 for a year. Schenck said it planned to eliminate all or most service after 9 p.m. and to eliminate weekend service. Saturday service on the N23, N25, and N57B, and Sunday service on the N22B, N24, N32C, N32W, and N33 would be eliminated.

Caso announced on June 14, 1972 that the county&#x27;s 10 private bus operators would be taken over by a public agency for $10 million, and would either be operated by an authority set up by the county or the MTA. The takeover would be completed-either through condemnation or negotiated purchases-by the first quarter of 1973. After resisting for several years, Caso decided to push for public operation after the operators of the bus companies asked the county to continue and increase the subsidies they had been provided by the county for the previous six months to maintain service. Nassau had paid the ten operators $409,000 in the first six months of the year, and would pay $400,000 more through the end of 1972. Caso said he preferred a takeover by the MTA. $3 million of the $10 million for the takeover would come from the MTA and the state. The county was expected to have to cover the operation&#x27;s deficit of $500,000 to $1 million a year. A report by the Nassau County Department of Transportation on the planned takeover said that Nassau&#x27;s bus ridership had decreased by 112 percent in the previous year. The report said takeover would allow for the acquisition of new buses, including 50 new buses immediately, a revised fare structure including lower fares in many cases, and rationalized and expanded bus service, including the coordination of routes and schedules with those of the LIRR.

The County Board of Supervisors voted to take over ownership of the ten companies on October 30, 1972. The law did not specify whether the county or MTA would operate the bus routes. On December 27, 1972, Nassau County Executive Ralph G. Caso and MTA Chairman William J. Ronan announced the creation of a new MTA subsidiary, the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority, to take over the operations of 10 private bus companies by April 1, 1973. The Nassau County Transportation Commissioner Andrew G. Schiavone would lead the agency. The county was expected to pay $14 million to the companies in condemnation proceedings, with $9 million from Federal funds.
===MTA Long Island Bus===

During the first week of April 1973, Nassau County took over operation of four of the ten private bus companies (Bee Line, Rockville Centre Bus, Utility Lines, Stage Coach). This had been set to take place the previous week, but was postponed due to legal technicalities. The other six companies (Roosevelt Bus Line, Schenck Transportation, Branch Bus Corporation, Jerusalem Avenue Bus Line, Universal Auto Bus, Hempstead Bus Corporation) were expected to be taken over later in April. In March 1973, County Executive Caso said that an agreement had been reached with the Amalgamated Transit Union and the United Transportation Union following discussions in Washington that would allow the county and the MSBA to modify, eliminate, or add new bus routes, consolidate bus garages, and assign personnel to those routes and garages without needing to take into consideration the union or geographical areas the workers belong to. It would cost the county approximately $29 million over five years to purchase and operate the routes. The agreement with the MTA would be renewed every year, and both sides had the right to end the agreement on 60 days&#x27; written notice.

On May 30, 1973, Nassau County signed a contract to take over all ten private bus companies in the county. The county would subsidize service until it could become self-sustaining, and would have to pay $5.6 million by June 15, which was the original offer it had made to the companies for their capital assets. The county would lease its buses to the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority (MSBA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The federal government would pay $9 million, which was about two-thirds of the capital cost. 18 new buses were ordered for $40,000 each. The MSBA started operating the system in June 1973. Of the 298 vehicles acquired, 50 required major repairs, and 24 were unusable. Nassau County implemented a half-fare program for the elderly during certain weekday hours and on weekends following county ownership.

In October 1974, the MSBA said it started a comprehensive study on how to improve bus service in the county. It was funded by a $108,000 grant from the MTA, and a $212,000 grant from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA). The same month, the first 15 of 50 new buses were placed into service.

Service was eliminated on seven routes and cut on three other routes on January 5, 1975 due to the MSBA&#x27;s budget crisis. Nassau had budgeted $5.2 million to fill part of the MSBA&#x27;s potential deficit of $6.8 million in 1975. These cuts were expected to save $1 million. Headcount at the MSBA would have to decrease by 25. The MSBA hoped to use federal and state aid to cover the remainder. The N19 would be truncated from Patchogue to Babylon since it operated at a deficit, despite high ridership, and was used by a large number of residents of Suffolk County Suffolk County Executive Klein met with directors of four bus companies in the county to take over this route section. Three Saturday-only bus routes (N7, N72, N74) and two weekday-only routes (N20, N67), along with special event buses from Queens and Nassau to the Nassau County Coliseum would be discontinued. The N52 and N52B would terminate at the Hempstead bus terminal instead of running along Fulton Avenue or Broad Street in West Hempstead, and the N79 would be rerouted between the Walt Whitman Shopping Center and Mineola. N79 bus service would no longer run along Broadway to Old Country Road and Round Swamp Road, but would continue along Plainview Road to Old Country Road and Manetto Hill Road. Some late night and early morning trips on routes were also discontinued, as were some trips during the day. The need for cuts was announced by the MSBA on November 14, 1974. The executive assistant to the head of the MSBA had said that the cut in the N19 could have been averted if Suffolk was willing to give the agency $250,000.

A public hearing was held on March 24, 1976, on the MTA&#x27;s proposed simplified fare structure, which would replace the system of zone fares that was in place before the MSBA takeover. Fares consisted of 25 to 40 cents for the first zone and a charge of 5 to 20 cents for each additional zone, and zones covered areas with distances anywhere between 1 and 10 miles apart. The MTA&#x27;s proposal would have a flat fare of 50 cents for buses in Nassau, and 75 cents between Nassau and Suffolk. Fares from Queens would be 50 cents to the Nassau County line, 65 cents to Great Neck, Franklin Square, Lynbrook, Elmont, New Hyde Park, Valley Stream, and most of Roslyn and Mineola, and 75 cents to points further east. There would be free transfers in Nassau for up to two trips on buses in the same general direction. Student fares would be 35 cents on all routes, and 50 cents on routes into Queens. In addition, half fares would be implemented for the handicapped and elderly, and the UniTicket discount program for riders to and from Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) stations would be expanded to be available at all 43 stations on the LIRR served by the MSBA on Long Island, along with Far Rockaway in Queens. Unitickets had been available for sale on a pilot basis at Massapequa Park, Freeport, Little Neck, Great Neck, and Rockville Centre since fall of 1975. The fare structure would also include a lower 35 cent fare for short trips, such as between Point Lookout and Long Beach, and on short loops to the Massapequa Park, Freeport, Rockville Centre, and Great Neck LIRR stations. On May 17, 1976, a spokesperson for the MTA said the new fare structure would take effect on May 30.

In September 1976, a bus transit center opened at the Great Neck LIRR station to allow the creation of a system of buses timed to arrive at the stations at the same time, permitting short transfers to many other bus routes, and to enable short connections to LIRR trains. Buses would run to Great Neck every 30 or 60 minutes outside rush hour, when some routes would run more frequently. One windy route was split into two more direct routes, a short section of one route was discontinued, routes were rerouted, and one bus was renumbered. The N21 was rerouted to detour from Northern Boulevard to serve the station, N21 trips that begin in Roslyn would be renumbered the N20 and be extended from Old Northern Boulevard and Mineola Avenue to Roslyn station via Mineola Avenue and Warner Avenue. The N20 would operate hourly on weekdays, with more frequent service during rush hours. Other buses would be rerouted, and the N77 would become the N27. The N20, N21, N25, N56, N57, N58, and N59 would start to serve the station starting September 13, 1976.

On September 4, 1977, major changes were made to three bus routes. Service on the N79 would be extended to the Plainview County Complex, and would be doubled to operate every 30 minutes instead of every 60 minutes. The N82 would be extended through Hicksville to Jericho Turnpike and North Broadway to serve the Mid-Island Plaza and provide a new north-south route with connections to the LIRR at both Bellmore and Hicksville. The N72B would be extended to the Sunrise Mall via South Farmingdale and be relabeled as the N71. Buses would run every hour between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. The N71 would take a more direct route to Farmingdale than the N72B, by operating via Hempstead Turnpike, instead of operating through North Levittown and Bethpage, saving up to ten minutes. In addition, the N51 was slightly rerouted to serve Nassau Community College and Hoftra University, and peak service was increased on busy routes, including the N4, N6, N15, N40, and N41. Due to low ridership, Saturday service on the N56, N57, N72C, and N72G would be discontinued.

The MTA Board, on June 9, 1978, voted to seek a $605,000 grant from the UMTA to create four new bus transfer centers at the Mineola, Lynbrook, Rockville Centre, and Freeport LIRR stations. The county would contribute $108,000 to the project. Most of the funds would go to hiring 30 new employees, mainly bus operators. The MSBA wanted to implement the plan at Freeport and Rockville Centre by January 1979, and at Mineola and Lynbrook by June 1979.

In November 1978, an MTA spokespersons said that five routes (N51, N53, N59, N79A, N82) might be eliminated as early as January, affecting 5,000 riders, and service on 21 other routes might be cut if Nassau did not provide an additional $1.5 million in subsidy. The cuts would cause 20 to 30 of the 450 bus operators to be laid off.

On August 27, 1980, the MSBA held a public hearing on proposed changes to bus service. These included the extension of N22 Sunday service from Roosevelt Field to Mid-Island Plaza to match Monday to Saturday service, and the creation of the N51 route, which would operate between Merrick and Roosevelt Field via Nassau Community College and Merrick Avenue. Service would run every 60 minutes, and would operate between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays, and between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Saturday. On December 17, 1980, the MSBA held a public hearing on proposed changes to bus service. These included the start of Sunday bus service on the N71, the extension of N39 Sunday service from Nassau County Medical Center to Mid-Island Plaza to match Monday to Saturday service, and the creation of the N55, which would mainly replace the N52. The N52 ran between Hempstead and Seaford via Jerusalem Avenue, while the N55 would run between Hempstead and the Sunrise Mall via Jerusalem Avenue, Broadway, and Sunrise Highway.

In March 1981, officials from Nassau County announced that a new bus depot would be constructed at Mitchel Field for $23.5 million. Construction was set to start in 1983 if the plan got approved that month. The maintenance shops at Uniondale and Amityville would close after the new facility was completed in 1984.

On September 6, 1981, the N20 route was extended from Roslyn to Hicksville to serve the New York Institute of Technology, the New York Chiropractic College, C. W. Post College Center, and SUNY-Old Westbury. Buses would no longer stop at Roslyn station. Buses would arrive at the schools 15 minutes before classes and depart 10 to 30 minutes after they end. In addition, new weekend service would begin on the Hempstead to Sunrise Mall route. On January 3, 1982, Sunday service began on the N1 and N25 routes, weekday N23 service began running every 30 minutes instead of every 60 minutes, the N36 was truncated from Hempstead to Lynbrook, and the N31 and N32 were extended from Lynbrook to Hempstead.

The MSBA held a public hearing on May 4, 1982 on several proposed changes to bus service. The N39D would be renumbered the N48, the N39C would be renumbered the N49, the N38 would be renumbered the N47, the N42 would be discontinued, a new N46 route would be created between Hempstead, the N27 would be rerouted during rush hours from Clinton Road and Stewart Avenue via Westbury Boulevard, Oak Street, Commercial Avenue, and Quentin Roosevelt Boulevard, weekday and Saturday N37 service would be extended from Atlantic Avenue and Grand Avenue to Baldwin Harbor Junior High School via Atlantic Avenue and Grand Boulevard, a new N50 route would be created, providing new weekday service between Bellmore and Hicksville via Bellmore Avenue, North Jerusalem Road and Newbridge Road, a new N70 route would be created to run on weekdays between Hempstead and Farmingdale via Hempstead Turnpike, Melville Road, Smith Street, and Pinelawn Road, serving the Route 110 corridor and SUNY-Farmingdale, the N72 would be improved, the N72C and N72G loop routes would be discontinued and replaced by the N70, N71, N72,and N73. A new N74 route would be created, running between Wantagh and Hicksville on weekdays via Wantagh Avenue, Hempstead Turnpike, and Jerusalem Avenue.

Changes would also be made to summer Jones Beach bus service. The JB53 route from Farmingdale would be discontinued due to low ridership, the JB21 route from Flushing would be combined with a portion of the JB57 route from Great Neck by running via the Great Neck LIRR station, with the remainder of the JB57 eliminated, the Queens portion of the JB22 route from Jamaica via Jamaica Estates, Fresh Meadows, and Glen Oaks would be discontinued, the JB24 from Jamaica via Jericho Turnpike would be combined with a portion of the JB51, and he JB39 from Hicksville via Newbridge Road would be renumbered JB50. In addition, fares on the buses to Jones Beach (other than the routes from Freeport and Wantagh) would increase by 25 to 75 cents depending on distance traveled. The new N46, N50, N70, and N74 routes would serve growing industrial areas in the eastern and central portions of the county and a new Hicksville transit hub. On June 11, 1982, the MTA approved these changes, which took effect on June 20. This was the largest increase in bus routes since the MSBA takeover.

A public hearing was held on March 15, 1984 on proposed service adjustments. The MSBA proposed eliminating the N69 on March 20, 1984 with service to be replaced by the City of Long Beach. On June 17, 1984, the N56 and N57 Great Neck routes would be discontinued, weekend service would be implemented on the N20, and Sunday N23 service would be extended from Roslyn to Manorhaven to match weekday service. For the 1984 summer season for Jones Beach, the JB21 would be discontinued, and the JB80, JB73, and JB50 would be consolidated into a new JB50 route from Mid-Island Plaza in Hicksville.

On June 17, 1985, the MSBA began a pilot route, the N28, between Roslyn and the Roslyn North Industrial Park. The route would operate every 30 minutes on weekdays between 6:50 and 9:20 a.m. and between 3:35 and 6:05 p.m. The route was created after a request was made by multiple businesses in the complex to the Town of North Hempstead. In December 1985, the route was made permanent. At the time, the route was used by 150 riders a day. On June 22, 1987, rush hour N24 bus service was extended from Roosevelt Field to 90 Merrick Avenue via the Mitchel Field complex, Hempstead Turnpike, and Glenn Curtiss Boulevard.

The 1990s saw the creation of a shuttle around Roosevelt Field (N93, now discontinued), two shuttles designed to take customers from train stations to work sites (the N94 and N95, both discontinued), and a service connecting Nassau County to JFK Airport (the N91, now discontinued). The system&#x27;s name was also changed from Metropolitan Suburban Transportation Authority to MTA Long Island Bus in 1994. 

On April 30, 1994, the MSBA started a new shuttle bus between Woodbury and Hicksville station in coordination with the LIRR. Buses would make four rush hour round trips to Gateways Commercial Park and Crossways Commercial Park, and run from the two office parks to Woodbury Commons Mall at lunch time. The shuttle was expected to reduce car use by about 200 cars a day.

On November 18, 2002, LI Bus introduced the Merrick Shuttle routes (N52 and N53) on a pilot basis to connect to the LIRR station and help ease a shortage of parking at the station. Service consisted of approximately 25-minute long western and eastern loops that met LIRR trains during rush hours. Two minibuses provided the service. Riders could flag down the buses anywhere along their routes. The routes for the N52 and N53 were determined using LIRR Mail and Ride data. An introductory fare was provided until January 3, 2003. This project followed an unsuccessful attempt by the New York State Department of Transportation, the Town of Islip, Suffolk Transportation, and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign to run a jitney to and from the Central Islip LIRR station. In December 2002, ridership on the Merrick Shuttle was about 50 a day.

In 2003, Long Island Bus improved service to Hempstead using Federal funding available through the Job Access Reverse Commute (JARC) program from the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. LI Bus created the N8 and N43 routes, and added Sunday service on the N27.

In 2007, Long Island Bus averaged over 109,000 weekday riders, many of which include customers connecting to other MTA services in the region. By 2011, the MTA had averaged 101,981 weekday riders by the time of the agency&#x27;s exit from operating the service.

===Privatization and NICE===

In 2010, the future of MTA Long Island Bus became uncertain, as the MTA threatened drastic cuts due to Nassau County&#x27;s disproportionately small contributions to the operation. Since 2000, the MTA had provided a unique subsidy (of $24 million in 2011 and over $140 million since 2000) to the Nassau County bus system that the other New York City suburban county bus systems did not receive. The county&#x27;s contribution was $9.1 million per year out of a total budget of $133.1 million, and the MTA wanted this contribution to increase to $26 million. Critics noted that Westchester County subsidized its similarly sized Bee-Line Bus System service by $33 million/year, and that Suffolk subsidized its substantially smaller Suffolk County Transit system by $24 million/year. The county hoped to reduce its contribution from $9.1 million to $4.1 million by using a private contractor; the planned county contribution was later decreased to $2.5 million/year.

By March 2011, the MTA—citing Nassau&#x27;s refusal to pay its contracted amount—proposed a set of major service reductions which would have eliminated 27 of its 48 routes and affected about 15 percent of its ridership, with the greatest impact on southeastern Nassau County, eliminating all routes operating south of Hempstead Turnpike and east of the Meadowbrook State Parkway (except for the N71). Service would have been eliminated entirely on the N1, N2, N8, N14, N19, N31, N33, N36, N45, N46, N47, N50, N51, N54, N55, N57, N58, N62, N72, N74, N78, N79, N80, and N81, on Saturday on the N16, and on Sunday on the N25. In addition, Able-Ride paratransit service along the fixed route services would be discontinued. A public hearing was held on March 23 on the proposed route changes and on the possible termination of the lease and operating agreement with Nassau County.

After reviewing the service cut plans, County Executive Ed Mangano considered severing ties with the MTA and privatizing the Long Island Bus system. A temporary reprieve, via additional state funding, would have sustained service through the end of 2011. In April 2011, the MTA voted to cease all bus service in Nassau County after the end of 2011. Mangano then announced that he had retained Veolia Transport to operate the system beginning in 2012 through a public-private partnership, pending legislative approval.

In November 2011, Veolia and Mangano announced that the service was going to be renamed Nassau Inter-County Express (or NICE), upon Veolia&#x27;s takeover of the system. All buses, including Able-Ride vehicles, would receive a new paint scheme to reflect the change. On December 12, 2011, the county legislature unanimously approved the Veolia contract, which was subsequently approved by the state-controlled Nassau County Interim Finance Authority on December 22, 2011. Veolia took over operations on January 1, 2012. The Veolia plan was the subject of heated county public hearings in which Long Island Bus riders and employees criticized the plan.

In February 2012, Veolia announced service cuts and adjustments to take effect in April 2012. While there were no route cancellations planned, just over $7 million in cuts to existing routes were planned, with service reductions and route concentrations planned for routes primarily serving northern and eastern Nassau County, beginning in spring 2012, with resources redirected towards busier routes. These cuts ultimately included decreased service on 30 routes, including the elimination of weekend service and decreased midday service on seven routes. These cuts were criticized as occurring too soon, only six weeks after starting service. 

In 2013, the NICE bus system obtained a &quot;windfall&quot; from increased New York State aid of $5 million and $3 million from a fare increase for MetroCard bus riders. In March 2014, the NICE bus system faced another $3.3 million budget deficit. At that time, the bus system expected an additional $1.2 million in state aid. On October 31, 2014, the Nassau County Legislature adopted a 2015 budget that would increase Nassau County&#x27;s contribution to NICE bus from $2.6 million to $4.6 million in 2015 and promised not to raise fares outside of MetroCard fare increases. This new $4.6 million contribution was hailed as a victory for Nassau County bus riders, although it still left NICE bus with a $6 million operating deficit. However, on December 11, 2014, Nassau County executive Ed Mangano proposed cutting $4 million from Nassau County&#x27;s NICE bus contribution, in addition to cuts to numerous other Nassau County services, to replace the $30 million that would be lost after the shutdown of Nassau County&#x27;s controversial school speed zone cameras.

On January 17, 2016, NICE eliminated fifteen routes due to a budget deficit and low ridership and restructured three other routes. On June 27, 2016, NICE restored service on two routes (n80/81) and restored two others (n14, n17) as shuttles. On September 6, 2016, NICE restored service on one route (n51) and restored three others (original n2, n62, n73) as shuttles. In December 2016, NICE announced a $12 million budget shortfall for FY2017 and warned of additional service cuts. These cuts were proposed to the Transit Advisory Committee, but failed to pass. A more severe set of cuts was passed in February, eliminating ten routes and reducing service on four routes. Many of these routes were the ones restored in 2016. Additional last-minute state funding allowed service on three routes to be saved. The cuts took effect on April 9, 2017.

In July 2018, a multi-year plan to restructure and improve service on the system was released for public comment. Improvements included a more developed frequency network, the restoration of former services, and new express bus service to Manhattan.

==Fare==
Fares can be paid with a MetroCard (including unlimited cards), coins, or on the GoMobile app. Neither dollar bills nor OMNY are accepted on any NICE fixed-route buses. Transfers are available upon request with coins, and are included automatically with MetroCard. The transfers are valid for two hours and can be used on two connecting NICE bus routes. Transfers are also valid on Suffolk County Transit, Long Beach Bus, Huntington Area Rapid Transit (HART) or MTA New York City Transit, with the following restrictions:
*Transfers to non-MetroCard buses are with coins only.
*Transfers to the New York City Subway, or New York City Bus or MTA Bus express service, are available with MetroCard only (express buses require additional fare).
*Transfers from Suffolk Transit, Huntington Area Rapid Transit (HART) or Long Beach Bus require payment of a $0.25 fare.
The full-fare fare is $2.90, the senior and disabled fare is $1.45, and the children&#x27;s fare is $2.25. Children under 44 inches ride for free. A single-ride GoMobile Ticket is $3.25. 20-trip packages are available for regular and senior and disabled fares, with one free ticket provided. Student fares are free and student passes are issued to students on request by their school system. These passes are only valid for travel in Nassau County on Mondays to Fridays during the school year from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. for travel to or from school. The Able-Ride paratransit fare is $4.00, payable in Able-Ride tickets or exact fare.

Fares were increased to $2.90 ($1.45 for seniors and disabled customers) from $2.75 ($1.35) on August 20, 2023.

==Bus depots==

Nassau Inter-County Express has two operating depots, one each for its fixed route and paratransit operations, as well as an additional depot that was closed in 2017.

===Current===
====Senator Norman J. Levy Transit Facility====
Senator Norman J. Levy Transit Facility (originally Mitchel Field Depot) is located at 700 Commercial Avenue in the East Garden City section of Uniondale, and is the headquarters and central garage for Nassau Inter-County Express fixed route service. The garage was initially named after the Mitchel Air Force Base that operated there from 1918 until 1961. All routes are dispatched from this garage. It handles both 60 ft articulated buses and 40 ft buses.

====Stewart Avenue Depot====
The Stewart Avenue Depot is located at 947 Stewart Avenue – also in the East Garden City section of Uniondale. All Able-Ride Nassau County shared-ride ADA paratransit service is dispatched from this garage.

===Former===
====Rockville Centre Depot====
The Rockville Centre Bus Depot is located at 50 Banks Avenue in Rockville Centre. This garage was originally the home of Bee Line, Inc, and was closed in 2017 as part of a cost-cutting move. It is currently used as a storage garage for retired NICE buses; the future of this depot is unknown at this time.

==Fleet==
All fixed-route NICE buses are ADA compliant and semi low-floor. All buses are also equipped with &quot;smart bus&quot; technology from Woodbury-based Clever Devices, which includes automated onboard route and stop announcements. However, Nassau Inter-County Express has recently hired Clever Devices again to replace its original &quot;smart bus&quot; system in most of the fleet with new on-board units and software that use GPS data to calculate the next stop announcements instead of odometer-based data with the older system. The new system will also provide maintenance with vehicle diagnostics data and provide customers and dispatchers alike with real-time bus location data accessible online (akin to MTA Bus Time).

===Active bus fleet===
====Fixed-route fleet====
====Future Fixed-route fleet====
NICE Bus has more electric buses pending for arrival by 2026. As with the MTA, NICE also plans to use only zero emissions buses from 2040 onward. 

====Paratransit &amp; Shuttle fleet====
All NICE Paratransit buses are 26 ft (7.9 m) long and use diesel fuel.
==Routes==

NICE runs fixed-route service on 41 routes, plus three shuttles, servicing the towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead, and the southern part of Oyster Bay, along with parts of the cities of Long Beach and Glen Cove. Non-shuttle routes are designated with a lowercase &quot;n&quot; for Nassau County, with service provided daily (although not all routes operate 7 days a week), and 24-hour service provided on the n40/41 Mineola - Freeport, n4 Merrick Road and n6 Hempstead Turnpike routes.
NICE routes operating to Jamaica (being the n1, n4, n4X, n6, n6X, n22, n22X, n24 &amp; n26) and Flushing, Queens (being the n20G &amp; n20X) operate closed-door service in Queens (that is, local service is not provided solely for travel within Queens; appropriate MTA bus services must be used instead). There are two exceptions to this: the n24, where one side of Jericho Turnpike/Jamaica Avenue is in New York City, but the other side of the street is in the Town of Hempstead (eastbound drop-off begins at 225th Street, where state maintenance of Jamaica Avenue begins, and westbound pickups occur as far west as 239th Street); and the n31, n31X, n32 and n33, which operate open-door in a portion of Far Rockaway where no other bus service is available. In addition, the n33 operates closed-door within the City of Long Beach, where local service is provided by Long Beach Bus.

<text>A Cobra probe is a device to measure the pressure and velocity components of a moving fluid. It is a multi-holed pressure probe with rotational axis of the probe shaft coplanar with the measurement plane of the instrument. Because of this geometry, when the instrument is rotated around the shaft&#x27;s axis, the measurement elements of the probe remain in the same location. The name cobra probe comes from the shape of the probe head which gives it this property.

Cobra probes come in three-, four-, and five-hole configurations, the former used for two-dimensional flow measurement, the latter two for three-dimensional flow measurement. In the three-hole kind of instrument, there are two yaw direction tubes which are chamfered and silver soldered symmetrically on the two sides of a pitot tube. It is otherwise similar to the other kinds of yawmeters. In the four- and five-hole configurations, the central pitot tube is surrounded by three or four chamfered tubes, respectively.

<text>Gunning Bedford Jr. (1747 – March 30, 1812) was an American Founding Father, delegate to the Congress of the Confederation (Continental Congress), Attorney General of Delaware, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 which drafted the United States Constitution, a signer of the United States Constitution, and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

==Education and career==

Bedford was born in 1747, in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania, British America, the fifth of eleven children to a wealthy family. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) on September 25, 1771, with honors, as a classmate of James Madison. He was admitted to the Delaware bar and entered private practice in Dover from 1779 to 1783. 

On July 17, 1775, the Second Continental Congress resolved to elect Bedford to deputy-muster-general for New York in the Continental Army, during the American Revolutionary War. On February 28, 1776, he was assigned to the northern army in Canada to muster troops there monthly. On June 18, 1776, he was promoted to muster-master-general and assigned to New York. He served briefly as an aide to General George Washington.

He was a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation from 1783 to 1785. He was Attorney General of Delaware from April 26, 1784, to September 26, 1789. He was appointed a commissioner to the Annapolis Convention in September 1786 but did not attend. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the United States Constitution and was a signer of the Constitution. During the convention, Bedford&#x27;s threat, &quot;the small ones would find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice&quot; was shouted down as treasonous by the other delegates. 

He was a member of the Delaware convention which ratified the Constitution in 1787. He was a member of the Delaware Legislative Council (now the Delaware Senate) in 1788, and was a candidate in the 1789 United States House of Representatives election for Delaware&#x27;s at-large seat. Bedford was nominated by President George Washington on September 24, 1789, to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, to a new seat authorized by . He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 26, 1789, and received his commission the same day. Bedford was a leading advocate for the abolition of slavery.

==Family==

Bedford was a cousin of Gunning Bedford Sr., a Governor of Delaware. In late 1772 or early 1773, Bedford married Jane Ballareau Parker, the daughter of James Parker, a printer who had learned his trade from Benjamin Franklin. He had 5 children, none of whom married. In 1793, he purchased Lombardy Hall on 250 acres in Brandywine Hundred.

==Death and legacy==

He died in office as a federal judge on March 30, 1812. He was interred first in the Presbyterian Cemetery in Wilmington. His remains were moved to the Masonic Home Cemetery at Christiana, Delaware. The cemetery is now the location of the Wilmington Institute Library.

<doc id="559076" wikidata="Q668312" url="?curid=559076" title="Tentacle erotica">
<text>is a type of pornography most commonly found in Japan that integrates traditional pornography with elements of bestiality, fantasy, horror, and science fiction. It is found in some horror or hentai titles, with tentacled creatures (usually fictional monsters) having sexual intercourse, predominantly with females or, to a lesser extent, males. Tentacle erotica can be consensual but mostly contains elements of rape.

The genre is well known enough in Japan that it is the subject of parody. In the 21st century, Japanese films of this genre have become recognized in the United States and Europe, although it remains a small, fetish-oriented part of the adult film industry. While most tentacle erotica is animated, there are also a few live-action films that depict it.

==History==
The earliest examples of tentacle erotica were woodblock prints depicting women being violated by octopuses, such as Kitao Shigemasa&#x27;s &quot;Programme of Erotic Noh Plays&quot; (1781) and Shunshō Katsukawa&#x27;s &quot;Lust of Many Women on One Thousand Nights&quot; (1786). 

Another early instance is an illustration from the 1814 Hokusai book , known as &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot;. It is an example of shunga (Japanese erotic woodblock art) and has been reworked by a number of artists, such as Masami Teraoka, who brought the image up to date with his 2001 work &quot;Sarah and Octopus/Seventh Heaven&quot;, which was part of his &quot;Waves and Plagues&quot; collection. 

While Western audiences in many cases interpret Hokusai&#x27;s famous design as rape, Japanese audiences of the Edo period would have viewed it as consensual, recognizing the print as depicting the legend of the female abalone diver Tamatori. In the story, Tamatori steals a jewel from the Dragon King. During her escape, the Dragon King and his sea-life minions (including octopuses) pursue her. The dialogue in the illustration shows the diver and two octopuses expressing mutual enjoyment.

Contemporary censorship in Japan dates to the Meiji period. The influence of European Victorian culture was a catalyst for legislative interest in public sexual practices. After World War II, the Allies imposed a number of reforms on the Japanese government, including censorship laws. The legal proscriptions against pornography, therefore, derive from the nation&#x27;s penal code. Presently, &quot;obscenity&quot; is still prohibited. How this term is interpreted, however, has not remained constant. While exposed genitalia (and, until recently, pubic hair) is illegal, the diversity of permissible sexual acts is now fairly wide, relative to other liberal democracies.

Leaders within the tentacle porn industry have stated that much of their work was initially directed at circumventing this policy. According to the mangaka Toshio Maeda:

==Culture==

===Animation===
The earliest animated form of tentacle erotica was in the 1985 original video animation (OVA) &quot;Dream Hunter Rem&quot;, though the scene in question was excised when the OVA was re-released in a form with sexual scenes removed. The first purely non-erotic anime portraying a tentacle assault would be the 1986 anime OVA &quot;&quot;, where a female Chronos soldier named Valcuria is enshrouded by the second (damaged) Guyver unit that surrounds her in tentacle form and assaults her.

Numerous animated tentacle erotica films followed in the next couple decades. Popular titles like 1986&#x27;s &quot;Urotsukidoji&quot;, 1992&#x27;s &quot;La Blue Girl,&quot; and 1995&#x27;s &quot;Demon Beast Resurrection&quot; became common sights in large video store chains in the United States and elsewhere. The volume of films in this genre has slowed since the peak years in the 1990s, but they continue to be produced through the present day.

===Manga===

While manga has featured stories of heroes being attacked by monsters with tentacles since its early days, the earliest examples of tentacle erotica in manga belong to &quot;real life&quot; erotic comedy manga magazines, which predate &quot;ero-gekiga&quot;. Multiple scenes were found in the March 12, 1968 issue of &quot;Weekly Manga Q&quot;, where several creatures with tentacles attacked women. Another early example belonged to Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s sci-fi story &quot;The Returnees&quot; (1973), where a scene depicts a woman being assaulted and impregnated by a space creature. &quot;Legend of Lyon: Flair&quot; (1986), directed by Yorihisa Uchida, featured scenes of tentacle rape, and is arguably the first known animated hentai title to include it.

Toshio Maeda&#x27;s &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; was a pioneer in the tentacle rape genre with its mix of sex, and tentacles. Maeda&#x27;s depiction of tentacles was more creature-like and possessed at will, imitating male genitalia. However, six years prior to &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; in 1976, Maeda created his first tentacle work in an experimental short story called &quot;SEX Tearing&quot;, which is considered the origin for &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot; as well as the earliest work depicting sex between women and tentacles.
In 1989, Maeda&#x27;s manga &quot;Demon Beast Invasion&quot; created what could be considered the modern Japanese paradigm of tentacle porn, in which the elements of sexual assault are emphasized. Maeda explained that he invented the practice to get around strict Japanese censorship regulations, which prohibit the depiction of the penis but do not prohibit showing sexual penetration by a tentacle or similar appendages.

Go Nagai has also been known for including scenes of tentacle rape in his stories, the most notable examples being &quot;Barabanba&quot; and &quot;MazinSaga&quot;.

===Live action===
The use of sexualized tentacles in live-action films, while much rarer, started in American B-movie horror films and has since migrated to Japan. B-movie producer Roger Corman used the concept of tentacle rape in a brief scene in his 1970 film &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, a film adaptation of the H. P. Lovecraft short story of the same name. &quot;Vice&quot; magazine identifies this as &quot;perhaps cinema history&#x27;s first tentacle-rape scene&quot;.

A decade later, Corman would again use tentacle rape while producing &quot;Galaxy of Terror&quot;, released in 1980. Corman also directed a scene in which actress Taaffe O&#x27;Connell, playing an astronaut on a future space mission, is captured, raped, and killed by a giant, tentacled worm. The film borrows the concept of the &quot;Id Monster&quot; from the 1950s film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, with the worm being a manifestation of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s character&#x27;s fears. The scene was graphic enough that the film&#x27;s director, B. D. Clark, refused to helm it, and O&#x27;Connell refused to do the full nudity required by Corman, so Corman directed the scene himself and used a body double for some of the more graphic shots. Initially given an X-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, small cuts were made to the scene, which changed the film&#x27;s rating to &quot;R.&quot;.

Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; includes a scene where actress Ellen Sandweiss&#x27; character is attacked by the possessed woods she walks through. The evil spirit inhabiting the woods uses tree limbs and branches to ensnare, strip, and rape her, possessing her through the sexual acts in a way reminiscent of that in which tentacles are depicted in other pieces of media. The scene was repeated in a shorter version in the sequel, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, released in 1987. 

The 1981 Japanese film &quot;Edo Porn&quot;, about the life of artist Katsushika Hokusai, featured the &quot;Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot; painting in a live-action depiction. In the 1981 film &quot;Possession&quot;, a woman copulates with a tentacled creature, although the tentacles themselves are never explicitly shown to penetrate her.

The popularity of these films has led to the subsequent production of numerous live-action tentacle films in Japan from the 1990s to the present day. The theme rarely appears in adult American cinema and art; one example is American artist Zak Smith, who painted several works featuring octopuses and porn stars in various stages of intercourse. In 2016, Amat Escalante directed the art-house film &quot;The Untamed&quot;, which depicts a live-action scene between the female protagonist and a tentacled space alien.

<doc id="559077" wikidata="Q17163284" url="?curid=559077" title="Individual events (speech)">
<text>Individual events in speech include public speaking, limited preparation, acting and interpretation are a part of forensics competitions. These events do not include the several different forms of debate offered by many tournaments. These events are called individual events because they tend to be done by one person unlike debate which often includes teams. This distinction however is not entirely accurate any more given the addition of duo interpretation events and forms of single person debate. Competitive speech competitions and debates comprise the area of forensics. Forensics leagues have a number of speech events, generally determined by geographical region or league preference. While there are several key events that have been around a long time, there are several experimental events around the country every year that can be limited to individual tournaments. Forensics leagues in the United States includes the National Speech and Debate Association, the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association, the American Forensics Association, the National Forensics Association, the Interstate Oratorical Association and Stoa USA. Organized competitions are held at the high-school and collegiate level. Outside of the rules for each event provided by the individual leagues, there are several cultural norms within each region that are not written into law but are almost always followed. Rules for time limits vary by event and by individual tournaments, but there are penalties in every event for exceeding the time limits though the severity of the penalty widely varies.

== Public-speaking events ==
The public speaking events are typically memorized speeches that can be on any topic the competitor desires. Typically, the same speech is used for the entire competitive season but may not be used in more than one season. For the public speaking events, they are performed with the purpose to use information to relate a message to an audience.

=== Original Oratory ===

In Original Oratory, a competitor prepares an original speech which may be informative or persuasive in nature. A competitor may use one speech for the entire season. The purpose of Oratory is to inspire belief or reinforce conviction.

At the high-school level, the speech is generally delivered without visual aids or notes. In many leagues (including the two U.S. tournaments), the number of directly quoted words from other sources in the speech is limited; at the NFL nationals, the limit is 150 words. Speeches are generally eight to ten minutes in length, with a warning often given when the allowed time has expired; most tournaments have a 30-second grace period.

=== Persuasion ===

Persuasion is often considered the collegiate equivalent of Oratory. The focus of the event is to change, reinforce, or instill the attitudes, beliefs, and values of the audience. Although few rules that dictate what topics or formats are permissible in persuasion, most persuasion speeches are policy-based; speakers advocate a specific policy proposal to address a need, offering their recommendation in a problem-cause-solution or cause-effect-solution format. In 2006, the winning persuasion topics at the American Forensics Association (AFA) and National Forensics Association (NFA) were how to improve teacher retention and encourage citizens to correspond with their members of Congress. This style of speech is also featured at the Interstate Oratorical Association - the oldest public speaking organization in the US - where the top persuasive speakers from each state compete at an annual national contest.

=== Informative ===

Informative speaking, also known as Expository Address, is a speech meant to inform the audience. The speech may range from the newest, high tech inventions from around the world to cure cancer to lighthearted topics, such as Wikipedia. The speech is supposed to be objective, without any judgement or evaluation of the topic. The speaker&#x27;s job is to make a complex topic easier to understand. In intercollegiate competition, the time limit is ten minutes and the speech is typically memorized. In high-school competition, time limits vary by U.S. state. Some informative speeches use visual aids; visual aids and puns (or wordplay) are emphasized in California, although neither are required.

===Declamation ===

Declamation, or memorized speech, is the high-school interpretation and presentation of a non-original speech. Speeches may be historical (such as Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech) or adapted from magazine articles, commencement addresses, or other adaptations of non-original material (including forensics speeches from previous years). Declamations are generally persuasive, and the competition is similar to Original Oratory. Like Oratory, speeches are about eight minutes long.

===Rhetorical criticism ===

Rhetorical criticism, or communication analysis, is an individual collegiate event in which the speaker has ten minutes to present a speech. The speech usually consists of an introduction, the presentation of a rhetorical artifact, a communication theory or model, the application of the communication theory to the artifact, the implications of that analysis, and a conclusion.

The artifact may be anything of rhetorical significance, such as a book, a speech, an advertising campaign, or a protest movement. The speaker identifies the goals the artifact seeks to accomplish. They then select a model form of analysis (typically borrowed from communication scholars) to determine the effectiveness of the artifact in reaching its goal; for example, in analyzing an anti-smoking campaign the speaker might choose a model discussing the most effective methods of employing fear to persuade a mass audience. They would then apply the model to the artifact and draw conclusions about the artifact&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, the success or failure of the model as an analytical tool, and other insight gained from the analysis.

===Special-occasion speaking ===

Special-occasion speaking, a high-school event, is similar to Oratory but focuses on lighter subjects and addresses a specific audience. Although comedy is frequently heard in special-occasion speaking, it should not detract from the message the speaker is trying to relate. The speech is not as strictly persuasive as in Oratory, but can be designed to inform. Speeches are typically six to eight minutes long.

===After-dinner speaking / Speech to entertain ===

After-dinner speaking or speech to entertain is a public-address event which makes greater sense of a topic with humor. Although it can take the form of any of the accepted public-speaking structures, it often takes the form of an informative or persuasive speech. The event covers a variety of topics, but the use of humor is central to its execution. The speech should not resort to base humor, but should be topical and relevant to the idea presented. This type of speech, found at the collegiate level, is typically six to ten minutes long. Generally, it is a humorous speech with a serious undertone or point.

==Limited-preparation events ==

A limited-preparation event is an event in which the speakers have no prior knowledge of the speech they will give, with a set amount of preparation time to write a short speech. Preparation times vary by event and range from two minutes to an hour, after which the competitors deliver their speeches.

=== Broadcasting ===

A radio speech is a prepared event which includes news stories and a commercial. Speakers receive a packet with a prepared newscast and must edit and compile these stories into a five-minute newscast that is unique and engaging. Preparation time varies by state from 15 to 45 minutes. Transitions are expected to be smooth, and the newscast should be as close as possible to five minutes. Scoring is based on reading clarity, adherence to the time limit, and the appeal of the stories chosen.

=== Extemporaneous speaking ===

Extemporaneous speaking is a speech given with little preparation and traditionally without access to the internet for citation (Though many states have opted to allow the use of internet). At the beginning of a round, speakers are usually given three questions relating to current events and asked to choose one on which to prepare a speech. During the preparation period (usually thirty minutes), periodicals may be used to prepare the speech. The speech, presented with limited notes, is six to eight minutes long on the collegiate circuit. The main purpose of the speech to make an argument answering the question given at the beginning of the round and convince the audience that this interpretation is the most correct. Although some high-school competitions divide extemporaneous speaking into domestic and international categories, few collegiate competitions do so.

=== Impromptu speaking ===

In impromptu speaking, competitors are given a topic (usually a word or phrase which may be a person, thing, a well-known saying, a less well-known quotation, a current event, or an object) and compose a speech based on the prompt. Impromptu speeches are usually four to six minutes long (with 15 seconds to seven minutes of preparation time), but other tournaments have no limits on preparation time or speech length. Judging typically focuses on speaking ability (such as enunciation, pace, and vocal variety), creativity, and overall balance of the speech (such as points of roughly-equal length and appropriate length of introduction and conclusion). In many states, impromptu speaking is a contest combining wit and humor with insight; speeches should be funny, but also make a point.

=== Extemporaneous commentary ===

Competitors in extemporaneous commentary are given a topic of national, regional or local importance, and prepare a speech on that topic during a preparation period. Judging focuses on the quality of the vocal presentation, the organization of the speech and the use of sources to back up assertions. The speech is usually presented seated. According to the National Forensic League, the event imitates the work of media commentators who speak about trends or community problems.

=== Extemporaneous programmed reading ===

Extemporaneous programmed reading is a high-school tournament event in North Dakota. It is more similar to interpretation than limited-preparation events, since each round is an interpretation; however, it differs in that each competitor receives the piece for each round in a one-hour draw and read and cut the piece for interpretation. Three kinds of interpretation are represented in different rounds, one of which is used for the finals: humorous, serious, and poetry. Each competitor has seven minutes to deliver the cut interpretation before the judge.

=== Storytelling ===

In storytelling, a high-school event, competitors are given a children&#x27;s book, fairy tale, fable, myth, legend, or ghost story to read. They have a half-hour to read the given piece and recast it in their own words before presenting their version to the judge in under eight minutes. Stage make-up, costumes, and props are prohibited. Different voices and characters are used, and each character should be easily distinguished.

=== Apologetics ===

In this NCFCA and Stoa USA event, competitors are given four minutes to prepare a six-minute speech on a question relating to Christianity. The questions are published online in advance, and the rules are generally the same as for impromptu speaking.

== Acting and interpretation events ==
Though the purpose of each event differs based on if it is an acting event or an interpretation event, all of these events seek to use different forms of literature to tell a certain theme or story.

=== Dramatic Interpretation ===

In Dramatic Interpretation, a competitor interprets a selection from a dramatic theatrical script. A competitor plays several parts, which are differentiated with a variety of positions and voices. Each character should be clearly distinguishable, and a competitor can also play a single character. The use of a manuscript depends on the individual tournament and circuit, though typically it is required at the college level and not allowed at the high school level.

=== Humorous Interpretation ===

In Humorous Interpretation (shortened to HI or humorous), the humorous alternative to DI at the high-school level, a competitor performs an eight- to ten-minute selection from a humorous literary work. Much of the rules for HI are identical to its dramatic counterpart with the only difference being that the presentation is funny.

=== Original comedy ===

Original comedy is an entirely original event in which competitors write a comic story, the structure of which is entirely up to them. The story often involves a main character and several different side characters which the competitor will &quot;pop&quot; in and out of quickly. No introduction is required and no props or manuscript are allowed. This is a high school event with a time limit of 8 minutes.

=== Serious interpretation ===

Serious interpretation, a high-school event, is open to any literary work.

=== Duo Interpretation ===

Similar to DI and HI, Duo Interpretation pieces have at least two parts performed by two people. In the collegiate level of this event, the presenters are not allowed to make physical or eye contact or use props, can only touch the ground with their feet. There are no props, costumes, or visual aids allowed however in the collegiate circuit a manuscript is often used The body of work can be from one literary source.

=== Duet acting ===

Differing from the college Duo Interpretation, in high school there are two events of duet acting called humorous duet acting and dramatic duet acting. Despite addressing slightly different themes of humor and drama, both events have similar rules. A cutting from only one script is used and though there are still no costumes or visual aids, most tournaments allow for the use of one table and two chairs provided by the tournament. The use of a manuscript is typically not allowed. Differing from the college version, participants are allowed to look and touch their duet partners.

=== Prose interpretation ===

Prose interpretation is the interpretation of a single or multiple works of prose. In many styles of competition, since competitors interpret the literature with facial expression and eye contact, memorization is helpful; however, points may be deducted if a speech is too memorized and the competitor does not appear to be reading. However, in many other styles of competition, such as the MSHSL, memorization is actually encouraged. In college forensics the maximum time allowed is 10 minutes, including an introduction.

=== Poetry interpretation ===

Poetry interpretation is the interpretation of a single or multiple works of poetry centered around a single literary theme. The poetry used can have traditional poetic meter though it is not required. The separate pieces are cut together into a single program that lasts a maximum of 10 minutes, on the college level, with an introduction 

=== Program Oral Interpretation ===
Program Oral Interpretation is an event all about intertextuality—this specific event differs from the rest because it focuses on the interrelationship between works of literature. Through the medium of performance, we take what constitutes a text to be almost anything when recorded somehow. Unlike other categories in the Speech and Debate medium, this means you can use anything that is considered text throughout your program to construct a cohesive story. That specifically allows prose, poetry and drama. Program Oral Interpretation means going above and beyond the usual places to find literature and reading anything for all intents and purposes. The intention of Program Oral Interpretation is to seek and demonstrate how different texts relate and speak to one another as if they were having a conversation for the first time. All texts chosen should inevitably be related upon on cohesive topic. Documentaries, spoken word pieces, statistics, news reports, memoirs, and almost anything else, speak to one another through your arrangement to form a cohesive argument. The core of this event is to focus on the argumentation and have the text be a catapult to drive your argumentation. This event is offered at the college level as well as in some high school regions.

== Individual-events tournaments ==

Individual-events tournaments usually last for six to twelve hours to complete, with the longest tournaments lasting several days. Tournaments have preliminary rounds, followed by possible semifinal and final round for each event.

A speech round consists of performances by five to eight competitors, who are then ranked by a judge. Competitors from the same school usually do not compete against each other in preliminary rounds, and are identified by an alphanumeric code to prevent bias by judges.

In a round, a competitor earns points for themselves and their team according to their ranking by a judge. The top competitors from each team in each event score points. At the awards ceremony, medals or trophies are given to individuals and team awards are given to the teams with the most points.

<text>Valdas Adamkus (; born Voldemaras Adamkavičius; 3 November 1926) is a Lithuanian politician, diplomat and civil engineer who served as the fifth and seventh president of Lithuania from 1998 to 2003 and again from 2004 to 2009.

Adamkus&#x27; first tenure as president lasted for five years, from 26 February 1998 to 28 February 2003, following his defeat by Rolandas Paksas in the 2003 presidential election. Paksas was later impeached and removed from office by a parliamentary vote on 6 April 2004. Soon afterwards, when a new election was announced, Adamkus again ran for president and was re-elected. His approval ratings increased during this period and become a highly regarded moral authority in the state. He was succeeded as president on 12 July 2009 by Dalia Grybauskaitė. He is considered by some as being one of the best Lithuanian leaders in modern history.

He was married to Alma Adamkienė, who was involved in charitable activities in Lithuania. Following the end of his term as president, Adamkus remained involved in international development, and is a member of the European Academy of Diplomacy.

== Early life ==
Valdas Adamkus was born on 3 November 1926 into a Roman Catholic family in Kaunas. He was originally given the name &quot;Voldemaras Adamkavičius&quot; but had it changed to &quot;Valdas Adamkus&quot; in 1955. His father was one of the first heads of the Lithuanian Air Force School in the Republic of Lithuania. His uncle was Edvardas Adamkavičius, who was a general in the Lithuanian Armed Forces during the interwar period. During his youth, Adamkus was interested in track and field. He also set the national record for running 100 meters.

As a young man, Adamkus joined the underground resistance against the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940. Under the Nazi occupation, while attending high school, he distributed an anti-German underground newspaper. In 1944, as the Soviets were invading Lithuania for a second time in four years, he fought against the second occupation by joining the Fatherland Defense Force, which was crushed by the numerically superior Soviet forces. He and his family fled Lithuania in order to avoid the second Soviet occupation.

===Emigration to the United States===
He attended the University of Munich in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1949. Fluent in five languages – Lithuanian, Polish, English, Russian, and German – he served as a senior non-commissioned officer with the United States 5th Army Reserve&#x27;s military intelligence unit in the 1950s. 

After arriving in Chicago, Illinois, as a displaced person, he first worked in an automobile factory and later as a draftsman. Adamkus graduated as a civil engineer from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1961. While a student, Adamkus, together with other Lithuanian Americans, collected about 40,000 signatures petitioning the United States government to intervene in the ongoing deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia by the Soviets. The petition was presented to then-Vice President Richard Nixon. Adamkus also raised concerns about other Soviet activities in occupied Lithuania to United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld in 1958, and to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.

== Career in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ==

He joined the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at its inception in 1970, working in Cincinnati. In 1981, he was appointed regional administrator by President Ronald Reagan, and was responsible for all air, water, hazardous waste, and other pollution control programs in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 1985, President Reagan presented him with the Distinguished Executive Presidential Rank Awardthe highest honor that can be bestowed upon a civil servant.

In 1972, Adamkus visited Lithuania for the first time in almost thirty years. He was a member of the official delegation from the United States attending an environmental conference in Moscow. As &quot;perestroika&quot; took root in the Soviet Union, Adamkus&#x27;s visits to his homeland became more frequent. Valdas Adamkus served as regional administrator of the EPA for sixteen years, and retired in 1997, after twenty-nine years of service. Upon his retirement, he received a congratulatory letter from President Clinton and a Distinguished Career Award from EPA Administrator Carol Browner. EPA Region 5 presented him with the newly established &quot;Valdas V. Adamkus Sustained Commitment to the Environment Honor Award&quot;.

== President of Lithuania ==
=== First administration (1998–2003) ===

Shortly after leaving the EPA, Valdas Adamkus moved back to Lithuania. Soon after his decision to run for presidency in 1998, he faced a legal battle in the Lithuanian courts. Doubts arose whether Adamkus was eligible to run for the presidency due to having spent over half a century abroad, raising the possibility that he might not meet minimum residency requirements. However, the court resolved the case in Adamkus&#x27; favor, and no other obstacles remained other than his U.S. citizenship, which he officially renounced at the American Embassy in Vilnius. He was elected as President of Lithuania in 1998, defeating Artūras Paulauskas in the runoff, serving from then until 2003, when he ran for re-election, but was unexpectedly defeated by Rolandas Paksas.

He returned to politics after the presidential scandal of 2003 and 2004, when his former rival Paksas was impeached and removed from office. In the first round of the 2004 election, held on 13 June 2004, Adamkus securing 30% of the vote – more than any other candidate. Paksas could not run for office again, because a ruling from Lithuania&#x27;s Constitutional Court disallowed him from running for public office and he was, therefore, unable to register as a candidate. A runoff election was held on 27 June 2004, which Adamkus won with about 52% of the votes against Kazimira Prunskienė. By 2009, he had served the two presidential terms permitted by the Constitution of Lithuania and was succeeded as president by Dalia Grybauskaitė.

In 2003, Valdas Adamkus was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Construction of Knowledge Societies. The Director-General of UNESCO, Koïchiro Matsuura, noted that Adamkus was named as Ambassador &quot;in recognition of his dedication to the Organization&#x27;s aims and ideals and with a view to benefiting for the construction of knowledge societies from his wisdom and extensive experience in many of UNESCO&#x27;s areas of concern, in particular promotion of social development, cultural diversity, dialog and international cooperation.&quot;

=== Second administration (2004–2009) ===

====Foreign affairs====

Under his second administration, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and Ján Kubiš, served as a mediator during Ukraine&#x27;s political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled in an interview that &quot;when I asked what we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop whatever they were doing and come to Kiev immediately.&quot;. The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held.

Valdas Adamkus and his Estonian counterpart Arnold Rüütel rejected an invitation to participate in a commemorative celebration of the end of World War II in Europe in 2005. President Adamkus expressed the view that the war&#x27;s end, in Lithuania, marked the beginning of a fifty-year Soviet occupation and repression. In response, on 22 July, the United States Congress unanimously passed a resolution that Russia should &quot;issue a clear and unambiguous statement of admission and condemnation of the illegal occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991 of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania&quot;, but Russia refused.

President Adamkus supports an active dialog between European Union member states and former Soviet republics such as Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, that are actively seeking membership in the EU. He expressed support for these candidate members during the Community of Democratic Choice in 2005, at the Vilnius Conference 2006, and on several other occasions.

Valdas Adamkus is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

====Domestic affairs====

Valdas Adamkus enjoyed a very high approval rating in Lithuania. He was also recognized for the second time for his support of Lithuanian youth. President Adamkus was actively involved in government reorganizations in 2004 and 2006. In his 2006 State of the Nation address, Adamkus stated that his top priorities were:
* Increasing public participation in the political realm
* Targeted and transparent use of the EU funds and opportunities for building a greater well-being in Lithuania
* Reforms in public governance, education and science, social support and health care
* The development of professional competence among civil servants, especially in assessing regulatory impacts
* Approval of a political code of ethics
* Direct mayoral elections, and elimination of the county system
* Construction of a new nuclear power unit in Ignalina
* Legislation regulating the selection, appointment, and promotion of judges
* Controlling &quot;brain drain&quot; by supporting research and higher education infrastructure

==Personal life==
In 1951, Adamkus married Alma Nutautaite. They had no children. They funded the manufacturing and installment of the largest bell of Kaunas Carillon which weights 751 kg. Nutautaite died in May 2023 at the age of 96.

On 3 January 2025, Adamkus was hospitalized at the Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos in Vilnius after experiencing a &quot;worsening&quot; cardiac condition.

<text>Antanas Merkys (; 1 February 1887 – 5 March 1955) was the last Prime Minister of independent Lithuania, serving from November 1939 to June 1940. When the Soviet Union presented an ultimatum to Lithuania demanding that it accept a Soviet garrison, President Antanas Smetona fled the country leaving Merkys as acting president. Merkys ostensibly cooperated with the Soviets, and illegally took over the presidency in his own right. After three days, Merkys handed power to Justas Paleckis, who formed the People&#x27;s Government of Lithuania. When Merkys attempted to flee the country, he was captured and deported to the interior of Russia, where he died in 1955.

==Biography==

Merkys was born at Bajorai, near Skapiškis. Educated in law, he served in the Russian Army during World War I (1914–18). In 1919, he served as the newly independent Lithuania&#x27;s Minister of Defence before serving with the Lithuanian Army until his decommissioning in 1922. He then practised as a lawyer.

After the Klaipėda Revolt of 1923, Merkys became secretary to the Klaipėda Region Commissioner, Antanas Smetona. Following the 1926 Lithuanian coup d&#x27;état, he became Minister of Defence again until 1927, when he was made Governor of Klaipėda Region. In 1932, German demands prompted his removal as Governor and Merkys returned to practising law. He became Mayor of Kaunas in 1933 and served in this position until 1939. In 1936 was elected to the Fourth Seimas of Lithuania. When the Vilnius region came under Lithuanian administration as a result of the German-Soviet invasion of Poland and the Lithuanian-Soviet agreements, Merkynas became the government commissioner for Vilnius and the Vilnius region. He was soon replaced by Kazys Bizauskas. On 17 November 1939 he became prime minister.

==Soviet ultimatum and occupation==
When, on 14 June 1940, the Soviet Union presented an ultimatum to Lithuania, Smetona proposed armed resistance. Merkys suggested accepting the ultimatum and offered to resign as prime minister, but he temporarily remained in office. Merkys agreed to Soviet demands that Smetona be arrested, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Rather than accept the demands, Smetona fled to Germany and then to Switzerland. Before leaving the country, he symbolically turned over his presidential duties to Merkys. Under the Constitution of 1938, the prime minister served as acting president whenever the president was unable to carry out his duties.

The day after Smetona&#x27;s departure, Merkys announced on national radio that he had removed Smetona and was now president in his own right. The following morning, the cabinet resolved that Smetona had effectively resigned by leaving the country, and confirmed Merkys as president. On 17 June 1940 Merkys acceded to more Soviet demands—a) dispatch police to arrest Skučas and Povilaitis near the Lithuanian border and b) appointing Justas Paleckis as the new prime minister. Merkys resigned later that day, making Paleckis acting president as well. The Soviets then used Paleckis as a puppet to provide the ostensibly legal sanction for its annexation of Lithuania a month later.

Since Lithuania regained independence from the Soviet Union, it has maintained that Merkys&#x27; takeover of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional, since Smetona never formally resigned. For that reason, Merkys is not recognized as a legitimate president in Lithuanian government records. When Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, it took the line that since Merkys&#x27; seizure of the presidency was illegal, all actions leading up to Lithuania&#x27;s annexation by the Soviet Union later that year were &quot;ipso facto&quot; void. Therefore, Lithuania contended that it did not need to follow the secession process outlined in the Soviet Constitution, since it was reasserting an independence that still existed under international law.

A month later Merkys attempted to escape to Sweden, but was arrested in Riga. He and his family were deported to Saratov in Russia. In 1941 Merkys was imprisoned. In 1954, during the period of de-Stalinization, Merkys was released from prison, but not allowed to return to Lithuania. He lived in Vladimir until his death the following year, on 5 March 1955. Subsequently, his grave could not be located, but a symbolic cenotaph dedicated to Merkys&#x27; memory is in the Petrašiūnai Cemetery in Kaunas.
