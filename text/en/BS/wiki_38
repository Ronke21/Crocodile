<text>Boris Tadić (, ; born 15 January 1958) is a Serbian politician who served as the president of Serbia from 2004 to 2012.

Born in Sarajevo, he graduated from the University of Belgrade with a degree in psychology. He later worked as a journalist, military psychologist, and teacher at the First Belgrade Gymnasium. Tadić joined the Democratic Party (DS) in 1990 and was elected to the National Assembly after the 1993 election. After the downfall of Slobodan Milošević in 2000, he was appointed as the minister of telecommunications in the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a role which he held until 2003, after which he was appointed minister of defence in the government of Serbia. Tadić was elected president of DS a year after the assassination of Zoran Đinđić after previously serving as a member of its provisional leadership. He stood as a candidate for DS in the 2004 presidential elections, which he won after beating Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Radical Party in the second round.

During his first mandate, he advocated cooperation and reconciliation of the former Yugoslav countries, became the first Serbian head of state or head of government to visit the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial, and launched an initiative for the Serbian parliament to adopt a resolution condemning the Srebrenica massacre. He successfully ran for re-election in 2008 after again beating Nikolić in the second round. During his second mandate, DS formed a coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia, its former opponent, which signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), while the EU abolished visas for Serbian citizens travelling to Schengen Area countries and Serbia received EU candidate status. Additionally, Serbia also completed its obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The period during his second mandate was also characterised by the challenges of the Kosovo declaration of independence and the global financial crisis, leading to low rates of economic growth.

After being pressured by protests that were organised by Nikolić&#x27;s Serbian Progressive Party in 2011, Tadić announced that snap elections will be held in 2012. He lost in the second round to Nikolić, who succeeded him as president of Serbia. Tadić was replaced by Dragan Đilas as the president of DS in November 2012, after which Tadić unsuccessfully sought to become the party&#x27;s president again in 2014. He then left DS and formed the New Democratic Party, later renamed to Social Democratic Party, which remained a parliamentary party up to the 2020 election, which it boycotted. A self-described liberal, he is an advocate of closer ties with the European Union (EU), supports the accession of Serbia to the European Union, and is widely regarded as pro-Western-orientated, while favouring balanced relations with Russia, China, United States, and the European Union.

==Early life==
Tadić was born in Sarajevo, the capital of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a republic within the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. His father, Ljubomir, was a philosopher and a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. His mother, Nevenka, was a psychologist. His maternal grandfather and up to six other relatives were killed by the Croatian Ustaše during World War II.

The Tadićs are descendants of the Serb clan of Piva, in the region of Old Herzegovina, Montenegro. The family&#x27;s slava (patron saint) is Saint John the Baptist. His parents frequently relocated between various cities and had moved to Sarajevo from Paris, where they pursued their doctoral studies, only a few days prior to his birth. Tadić and his family moved to Belgrade when he was three years old, and his father got a job at the newspaper &quot;Liberation (&quot;Oslobođenje&quot;)&quot;.

Tadić finished &quot;Pera Popović Aga&quot; (today &quot;Mika Petrović Alas&quot;) elementary school and matriculated at the First Belgrade Gymnasium in Dorćol. During his teenage years he played water polo for VK Partizan, but had to quit due to injuries. He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy with a degree in psychology, specifically social psychology in the department of clinical psychology.

He was arrested during his studies in July 1982 for protesting the arrest of a group of students, arrested for protesting against martial law in Poland and in support of the Solidarity movement. Tadić spent one month in penal labour prison in Padinska Skela.

He worked as a journalist, military clinical psychologist and as a teacher of psychology at the First Belgrade Gymnasium. Until 2003, Tadić also worked at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts at the University of Arts in Belgrade as a lecturer of political advertising. He is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

==Early political career==
Tadić joined the newly founded Democratic Party in 1990. He served as an MP and member of the parliamentary Science and Technology Committee following the 1993 Serbian parliamentary election.

Boris Tadić founded the Centre of Modern Skills (Centar modernih veština, CMV) in 1998, an NGO dealing with political and civic education, and the development of the political culture and dialogue.

The Democratic Party was part of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a grand coalition of anti-Milošević parties which played a key role in his downfall in 2000. Tadić was elected deputy leader of the Democratic Party twice, in February 2000 and then in October 2001.

Tadić served as Minister of Telecommunications in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from November 2000 to March 2003 and as Minister of Defence from March 2003 until he started his presidential campaign in April 2004. He served as an MP of the Democratic Party in the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Assembly and later went on to be the acting parliamentary leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition in 2003, the president of the Security Services Control Committee, as well as the parliamentary leader of the Democratic Party in the National Assembly of Serbia starting in February 2004.

The assassination of Zoran Đinđić in March 2003 led to a leadership convention of the Democratic Party in February 2004, which was won by Tadić against Zoran Živković. He was later reelected unopposed in regular leadership conventions in 2006 and 2010.

==Presidency==
===President of Serbia within state union (2004–2008)===

Tadić, as the newly elected Democratic Party leader, was chosen as the candidate for the presidential election. He defeated Tomislav Nikolić of the nationalist Radical Party in the run-off of the 2004 presidential election with 53% of the vote. He was inaugurated on 11 July of that year.

During the 2004 election campaign, Tadić promised to form a new special institution called the People&#x27;s Office. The People&#x27;s Office of the President of the Republic was opened on 1 October 2004. The role of the People&#x27;s Office is to make communication between the citizens and the President easier, and to cooperate between other state bodies and institutions, in order to enable the citizens of Serbia to exercise their rights. The People&#x27;s Office of the President is divided into four divisions: Legal Affairs Division, Social Affairs Division, Projects Division and General Affairs Division. The first Director of the People&#x27;s Office was Dragan Đilas. When he joined the Government of Serbia as the Minister in charge of the National Investment Plan in 2007, Tatjana Pašić became the new Director.

Tadić advocated cooperation and reconciliation of the former Yugoslav countries, strained by the burden of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. On 6 December 2004, Boris Tadić made an apology in Bosnia and Herzegovina to all those who suffered crimes committed in the name of the Serbian people. In July 2005, Tadić visited the Bosnian town of Srebrenica on the 10th anniversary of massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces. In 2007, Tadić issued an apology to Croatia for any crimes committed in Serbia&#x27;s name during the war in Croatia.

Tadić presided during the independence referendum in Montenegro (2006). He was the first foreign head of state to visit Montenegro after it became independent on 8 June, and promised to continue friendly relations. Serbia declared independence as well, and Tadić attended the first raising of the flag of Serbia at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

On 6 September 2007, Tadić was a signatory of the agreement that led to the formation of the Council for Cooperation between Serbia and Republika Srpska, together with Milorad Dodik and Vojislav Koštunica. In late 2007, he stated that Serbia does not support a break-up of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that, as a guarantor of the Dayton Accords that brought peace to Bosnia, he supports its territorial integrity. Tadić also said that Serbia supports the accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the EU, and NATO.

As President, Tadić has pursued a pro-Western foreign policy. On 28 September 2005, he met with Pope Benedict XVI in Vatican City, making him the first Serbian head of state to be granted an audience with a pope. This helped improve traditionally strained Catholic-Orthodox relations.

On 22 June 2007, Tadić presided over the 1000th meeting of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in Belgrade.

Contrary to his earlier decision in the 2004 Kosovan parliamentary election, Tadić stated that he had no right to call on Kosovo Serbs to vote in the 2007 Kosovo parliamentary election, as the standards he asked for in 2004 were not reached.

===Reelection campaign===
Boris Tadić has advocated an early presidential election that is required under constitutional law, since the adoption of the new Constitution of Serbia, after the successful constitutional referendum in October 2006. On 13 December 2007, the speaker of the Parliament, Oliver Dulić, set the election date for 20 January 2008. The Democratic Party submitted the candidacy of its leader to the Republic Electoral Commission on 21 December. Tadić held his first election convention on 22 December, in Novi Sad. The re-election campaign was led under the slogan ”For a strong and stable Serbia“ (&quot;За Јаку и Стабилну Србију&quot;) in the first round and &quot;Let&#x27;s win Europe together!&quot; (Да освојимо Европу заједно!) in the second. Tadić advocated integration of Serbia into the European Union but also territorial integrity of Serbia with sovereignty over Kosovo and Metohija. As a part of a campaign, Boris Tadić answered the 10 most interesting questions every week through the campaign website in the form of video response on YouTube.

Tadić received support from G17 Plus and Sanjak Democratic Party, partners from the Government. He also received support of various national minority parties including Hungarian and Romani parties. He received 1,457,030 votes (35.39 per cent) in the first round. In the second round on 3 February 2008, he faced Tomislav Nikolić and won the election with 2,304,467 votes (50.31 per cent). After the election he assured Serbian citizens in Kosovo that they would never be betrayed.

===President of Serbia (2008–2012)===
Tadić was sworn in at the inauguration ceremony on 15 February 2008 in the National Assembly of Serbia.

The Assembly of Kosovo proclaimed a declaration of independence on 17 February 2008. Boris Tadić urged a United Nations Security Council meeting to react urgently and annul the act. He also said that Belgrade would never recognise the independence of Kosovo and would never give up the struggle for its legitimate interests. Russia backed Serbia&#x27;s position and President Vladimir Putin said that any support for Kosovo&#x27;s unilateral declaration is immoral and illegal.
On 21 February Tadić met President of Romania Traian Băsescu in Bucharest where he thanked him for Romanian support and stated that &quot;Serbia will not give up its future in Europe&quot;.

Tadić said that Serbia would never recognise an independent Kosovo. He stated that the problem of Kosovo was not solved by the unilaterally declared independence and that the decade-long problems between Serbs and Albanians still exist. He called the international institutions to find a solution within the UN Security Council, for the continuation of negotiations. He also called a decision made by the US President George W. Bush to send arms to Kosovo &quot;bad news&quot;.
Tadić also said that Serbia would not accept the legality of the EU&#x27;s planned policing and judiciary mission for Kosovo. On 25 February 2008, Boris Tadić met with Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei Lavrov in Belgrade where Medvedev stated that &quot;We proceed from the understanding that Serbia is a single state with its jurisdiction spanning its entire territory, and we will adhere to this principled stance in the future, We have made a deal to coordinate together our efforts in order to get out of this complicated situation&quot;. Agreement on the South Stream pipeline was also signed during this visit.
On 5 April 2008, Tadić called the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj &quot;disgraceful because of the innocent victims&quot; and demanded the ICTY to appeal. He said that Serbia wishes to help the Tribunal to collect evidence &quot;because Haradinaj’s place is in prison&quot;. He said that former Hague Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte had said that witnesses in the case against Haradinaj had been intimidated and even murdered to prevent them testifying to his crimes.

Following the Republic of Kosovo&#x27;s formation of the Kosovo Security Forces in January 2009, he sent protest letters both to the and NATO Secretaries-General. The letter states that Serbia views those forces as an illegal paramilitary organisation that constitutes a threat to the country&#x27;s security and a danger to peace and stability in the Western Balkans. Tadić drew attention to the fact that the KSF were formed on the basis of the Ahtisaari Plan that was never adopted by the Security Council and added that the creation of these forces constitutes a breach of the Serbian Constitution and international law, which is why they should be disbanded. He called for the demilitarisation of Kosovo.

On 13 March 2008, President Tadić signed a decree dissolving the country&#x27;s parliament and slating early parliamentary elections for 11 May. Boris Tadić gathered a large pro-EU coalition around his Democratic Party and G17 Plus for the Serbian parliamentary election in 2008, named “For a European Serbia – Boris Tadić&quot;. The coalition list was led by Dragoljub Mićunović and it also included Sanjak Democratic Party, Serbian Renewal Movement and League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina. The coalition won 38% of the vote, more than any other list. He condemnеd remarks regarding the election made by Javier Solana and Pieter Feith and called on the European Union not to interfere with Serbian elections.

Tadić said that he was ready, authorised as per Vienna Convention, to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union if it were offered on 28 April, but not at the price of recognising Kosovo&#x27;s unilaterally declared independence. Tadić attended the signing of the SAA ceremony in Luxembourg on 29 April, where the Deputy Prime Minister Božidar Đelić signed the document on behalf of Serbia, as per the authorisation of the Government from December 2007. He was opposed by the then Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica who believed that Serbia ought not to sign &quot;any&quot; agreements with the European Union. While, on 1 May, Koštunica said that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was right when he said that the SAA should have been signed, he nonetheless vowed to annul the agreement after the parliamentary elections, calling it &quot;not in the service of Serbia&#x27;s territorial integrity.&quot;

On 27 June 2008, Tadić named Mirko Cvetković for the new Prime Minister, following the victory of his party coalition in parliamentary election that took place in May. Cvetković was sworn in after giving the oath in the National Assembly on 7 July 2008.

Following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, and Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Tadić refused to follow suit, saying that even though he respects the Russian support to Serbia regarding Kosovo, &quot;Serbia is not going to recognise these so-called new countries&quot;. He stated that &quot;Serbia is not going to do something that is against our interest, because we are defending our territorial integrity and sovereignty by using international law&quot; and that by constitution he must defend the interests of Serbia, and not the interests of any other country in the world.
Tadić invoked his constitutional powers of Commander-in-Chief of the Military of Serbia and dismissed the Chief of the General Staff Zdravko Ponoš on 30 December 2008. Ponoš made public accusations against the Defence Minister Dragan Šutanovac in the media. It was also revealed that he ignored the minister and has not submitted a single report in a year.
In April 2009, Tadić announced a constitutional reform proposal. His initiative includes the proposal to reduce the number of the National Assembly members from 250 to 150 to better reflect the size of the country followed by changes in law on party registration and financing in order to consolidate similar parties and limit those with little support which should bring Serbia closer to a two-party system. The second proposed amendment would change the administrative division of Serbia by dividing it into more autonomous regions in order to achieve a more balanced development. This change would lead to Serbia&#x27;s being divided into seven regions instead of the current asymmetrical division which includes two autonomous provinces but where the majority of the territory has no special autonomy. However, the proposals haven&#x27;t came to fruition.

During his visit to Serbia in May 2009, Lech Kaczyński, President of Poland, stated that he doesn&#x27;t agree with the decision of the Polish Government to recognise the independence of Kosovo and that he as the President &quot;favours the policy pursued by Serbian President Boris Tadić&quot;. They also discussed energy, particularly Europe&#x27;s dependence on natural gas from just one source, and agreed that there is a need for a common EU energy policy that should also include the Balkan states.
On 21 May 2009, Dragan Marić, a former businessman who was revolted over the court decision in his dispute with the national air carrier Jat Airways, entered the Presidency office carrying two hand grenades and seeking an out-of-court settlement signed by President or Government. Members of the Battalion of Military Police Cobras, providing security to the President of Serbia, managed to take one of the grenades immediately and isolate the attacker, however the perpetrator removed the pin from the second grenade and threatened to detonate it by releasing the lever. The negotiations were handled by the special team of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, supported by the officials of the Ministry of Justice, and lasted for several hours until the man was disarmed and arrested. After the incident, Tadić, who was present in the secured area of the building, congratulated the police and army special units, the security and negotiation team for doing a terrific job, peacefully and with no casualties and also said that problems, no matter what kind, cannot be resolved by force and by jeopardising citizens&#x27; lives.

In October 2009, after the Serbia national team qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Tadić and other Serbian ministers celebrated at the end of the match in Belgrade&#x27;s Red Star Stadium by toasting the winning team with a glass of champagne. It is illegal to consume alcohol at Serbian sporting events, in order to stop violence. Tadić pleaded guilty, saying &quot;I did not know that consumption of alcohol, even if only for a toast, has been forbidden so I fully take responsibility for the violation&quot; and was fined €400.

Some observers have describe that the coalition government led by Tadić&#x27;s Democratic Party introduced some media control mechanisms, which were further developed by the Aleksandar Vučić regime to severely curtail media freedom. Ljiljana Smajlović, editor-in-chief of &quot;Politika&quot;, has accused Tadić several times of pressuring editorial politics. Following his defeat at the 2012 presidential elections, Tadić and main opposition candidate Tomislav Nikolić had similar media coverage, but the campaign coverage was characterised by the lack of analytical and critical reporting, while some media outlets such as the weekly &quot;NIN&quot; and tabloid &quot;Blic&quot; showed a preference for Tadić.

===Advisors===
Advisors to the President of the Republic carry out the analytical, advisory and other corresponding tasks for the needs of the President of the Republic as well as other expert tasks in relations of the President with the Government and the Parliament.

Chief of Staff is Miodrag Rakić. Acting Secretary General of the Office of the President was Vladimir Cvijan from 2008 to 2010.

Previous advisors who served from 2005 to 2008 are Biserka Jevtimijević Drinjaković (economic issues), Vladimir Cvijan (legal issues) and Dušan T. Bataković and Leon Kojen (political issues). Most of the former advisors are now serving as directors of public enterprises and ambassadors.

==Post-presidency==
===2012 elections and aftermath===
On 5 April 2012, a day after announcing his decision, Tadić submitted his resignation to the speaker of parliament, Slavica Đukić-Dejanović, who then took over as acting president. This led to bringing forward the presidential election to coincide with the parliamentary election on 6 May.

Amid controversy regarding the legitimacy of the third mandate and the legality of certain decisions, incumbent Tadić lost the presidential elections to his opponent, Tomislav Nikolić from the Serbian Progressive Party. Nikolić won 49.7% of the votes in the runoff vote, versus 47% for Tadić, according to data from the Serbian Center for Free Elections and Democracy. The result was considered somewhat of a surprise, as Tadić had exploited his resignation for the presidential vote to coincide with parliamentary elections.

Tadić was criticised both inside and outside the party for the manoeuvre of calling early presidential elections without a clear goal, and entering them with over-confidence. Dragan Đilas, long-time mayor of Belgrade and one of rare Democrats who remained in his seat after 2012 elections, announced that he would challenge Tadić in December party elections. After a period of gauging the odds, it became obvious that Đilas would receive majority support. Before the electoral conference, Đilas and Tadić reached a face-saving agreement whereby Tadić would step down from the race and remain the party&#x27;s honorary president, and Đilas thus became the only major candidate. Đilas was elected president of the Democratic Party on 25 November 2012.

===New Democratic Party===
In early 2014, after losing the internal reelections in the Democratic Party to Dragan Đilas, Tadić resigned from his position of honorary president and left the party. Subsequently, a number of prominent party members defected from the party and stated that they intend to form a list in the forthcoming parliamentary election with Tadić as its leader. A coalition was agreed upon with the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina. A political party, named the &quot;New Democratic Party&quot;, was then formed and registered. In the same year the party was renamed Social Democratic Party (Serbia). In the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election, SDS took part as part of the Good Morning Serbia alliance.

==Policy and criticism==
===Coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia===
Following the 2008 election, Tadić&#x27;s Democratic Party was unable to form a pro-European government with the hard-line Liberal Democratic Party. Faced with the possibility of a eurosceptic government led by the Democratic Party of Serbia, the Serbian Radical Party and the post-Milošević Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Tadić proposed a coalition with the SPS. On 7 June 2008 at an assembly of the Main Board of the Democratic Party, Tadić compared the DS and the SPS saying that both grieved over the loss of their presidents, Đinđić and Milošević. His address was heavily criticised by members of the Liberal Democratic Party, the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina and the Social Democratic Union.

On 18 October 2008 Tadić and Ivica Dačić, President of the Socialist Party of Serbia, signed a &quot;Declaration of Political Reconciliation&quot; drafted in July, agreeing on further EU integration and negotiations with Kosovo based on UN Resolution 1244. The Declaration was again viewed as exonerating Milošević&#x27;s regime and the G17 Plus, the Serbian Renewal Movement and League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina refused to sign it despite supporting the government. It was also criticised by the right-wing Dveri and the Serbian Radical Party who called the declaration a reconciliation of the two wings of the League of Communists who split at the 8th Session. Tadić defended the reconciliation after the 2012 presidential election reiterating that Serbia was in need of consensus-building policies.

===Press freedom===

In 2011 Report, the Freedom House described the media situation as generally free and stated that press operated with little government interference, although most media outlets are thought to be aligned with specific political parties. Some observers have describe that the coalition government led by Tadić&#x27;s Democratic Party introduced some media control mechanisms, which were further developed by the Aleksandar Vučić regime to severely curtail media freedom.
Media associations criticised the ruling coalition for adopting the controversial Law on Public Information proposed by the G17 Plus.

On 8 April 2011 the European Federation of Journalists wrote to Tadić that press freedom in Serbia was seriously compromised, that the safety of investigative journalists in Loznica and Belgrade was threatened and that independent newspapers were struggling against economic pressure and political interference, sometimes even against undue judiciary pressure through court decisions. The two main journalism associations and the journalists&#x27; union stated support for the letter. Ljiljana Smajlović, editor-in-chief of &quot;Politika&quot;, has accused Tadić several times of pressuring editorial politics.

In September 2011 the Anti-Corruption Council, led by Verica Barać and with the support of Commissioner for Information of Public Importance Rodoljub Šabić, Ombudsman Saša Janković, and presidents of the two main journalism associations Ljiljana Smajlović and Vukašin Obradović, published a report detailing the state of the freedom of the press in Serbia from January 2008 to June 2010. The Council concluded that the media in Serbia was overwhelmed by strong political pressure, that full control over the media was established, that no medium broadcast objective and complete information, and that events were censored or reported on selectively and incompletely. The report concluded that marketing agencies owned by senior Democratic Party officials and Tadić&#x27;s close associates, namely Srđan Šaper and Dragan Đilas, held a significant share of the advertising market.

Following his defeat at the 2012 presidential elections, Tadić and main opposition candidate Tomislav Nikolić had similar media coverage, but the campaign coverage was characterised by the lack of analytical and critical reporting, while some media outlets such as the weekly &quot;NIN&quot; and tabloid &quot;Blic&quot; showed a preference for Tadić. On the other hand, the election observation organisations highlighted the many national-frequency televisions broadcast more affirmative content about the opposition parties.

==Personal life==

Tadić&#x27;s sister, Vjera, is a psychologist and currently teaches psychology in the First Belgrade Gymnasium. Besides his native language, Boris Tadić is reportedly fluent in English, French, Italian and German.

He was previously married to journalist Veselinka Zastavniković from 1980 to 1996, but they divorced, having had no children. They met in the 1970s. Throughout their marriage they were actively involved in various socio-political activities including protests and petitions against human-rights abuses and so-called &#x27;verbal delict&#x27; in SFR Yugoslavia in the 1980s as well as anti-Milošević protests in the 1990s.

Tadić was married to Tatjana Rodić, with whom he has two daughters. The couple separated in 2019.

He is tall.

Tadić&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Strahinja Kićanović, a wealthy tradesman and landowner who unsuccessfully ran twice for the office of member of parliament. He was killed during World War II at the Jadovno camp. Although this is today a well-known fact stated by Tadić on several occasions, Yugoslav communist authorities falsely listed Strahinja Kićanović as being killed simultaneously both at Jadovno and Jasenovac. This false claim was later even restated by institutions in Croatia and the United States.

==Honours and awards==
On 4 August 2007, Tadić was awarded the European Prize for Political Culture that is given by the Swiss Foundation &quot;Hans Ringier&quot; of the Ringier Publishing House in Locarno. Previously it was awarded to Jean-Claude Juncker. Tadić decided to donate the financial part of the award for humanitarian purposes for the maternity hospital in a town near Gračanica.

Tadić received the Quadriga award in September 2008, an annual German award sponsored by Werkstatt Deutschland, a non-profit organisation based in Berlin. The award recognises four people or groups for their commitment to innovation, renewal, and a pioneering spirit through political, economic, and cultural activities. The other three winners were Wikipedia, represented by Jimmy Wales; Eckart Höfling, Franciscan and director; and Peter Gabriel, musician and human rights activist. The award given to Tadić was named &quot;The Courage of Perseverance&quot; and was presented by Heinz Fischer, the Federal President of Austria.
In March 2010, Tadić received the Steiger Award &quot;Europe&quot; of the Rhine-Ruhr for &quot;respectfulness, openness, humanity, and tolerance&quot;.

In 2011, Tadić won the North-South Prize awarded by the Council of Europe and distinguishing his deep commitment and actions for the promotion and protection of human rights, defence of pluralist democracy, and the strengthening partnership of the north–south solidarity.

In 2012, in Brussels, Tadić, together with the ex-President of Croatia Ivo Josipović, was awarded the European Medal of Tolerance by the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, in recognition of the Balkan statesmen&#x27;s &quot;significant contribution to promoting, seeking, safeguarding or maintaining Tolerance and Reconciliation on the European continent&quot;.

Brentwood was located in between Rue Kimber and Chemin Chambly. Chemin Noble was among the main streets in the area, with Cousineau Boulevard becoming important much later on. Chemin Noble was named for Benjamin Noble, superintendent and resident of the area, upon its founding in the late 1910s. Brentwood was considered a &quot;summer hideaway&quot; by many Montrealers. It had no streets, electricity or telephone service. A small &quot;hut-like&quot; train station was located next to the railroad tracks and provided service to Montreal via the Montreal and Southern Counties Railway.

;Brookline
Brookline was also located in between Rue Kimber and Chemin Chambly. Mountainview Boulevard was the locale&#x27;s main street, with Cousineau Boulevard becoming a major artery much later on.

<doc id="544279" wikidata="Q4829273" url="?curid=544279" title="Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings">
<text>Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings is an open-air museum of rescued buildings which have been relocated to its site in Stoke Heath, a district of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, England. Founded in 1963 and opened in 1967, the museum was conceived following the dismantling of a 15th-century timber-framed house in Bromsgrove in 1962 to provide a location for its reconstruction. It became England&#x27;s first open-air museum and, after the St Fagans National Museum of History in Wales, the second in the United Kingdom. This building is known as the medieval &#x27;Town House&#x27; today, though it has been known by other names in the past, including the &#x27;Bromsgrove House&#x27; and the &#x27;Merchant&#x27;s House&#x27;. It now houses a collection of domestic, industrial, agricultural and other forms of historic building, the majority dismantled and re-erected.

The museum&#x27;s collection comprises more than 30 buildings and structures which have been relocated from their original sites under threat of demolition, being rebuilt and restored at the museum. This includes a fully functioning windmill and a post WW2 prefab house as used in many towns and cities after the Second World War to provide quick affordable replacements for houses destroyed by bombing. The Arcon V prefabricated house was originally constructed on Moat Lane in Yardley, Birmingham and was transported to the museum in 1981.

Weddings and receptions are frequently held in The New Guesten Hall, a building at the museum which was built to incorporate the preserved timber roof of Guesten Hall, originally built next to Worcester Cathedral for entertaining the Prior&#x27;s guests. The New Guesten Hall is also used by outside parties for concerts, conferences, exhibitions and meetings. The museum&#x27;s Victorian church, originally built in 1891 at Bringsty Common, Herefordshire, was opened and re-dedicated in 1996 and services are held there during the museum&#x27;s open season. The church is also licensed for wedding blessings.

The other exhibits, which span over 700 years of history, include a perry mill from Redditch, a toll house from Little Malvern, a fibreglass spire from Smethwick, an earth closet, a cruck-frame barn and a counting house.

==Exhibits==
The buildings and structures at the museum were all moved there to save them from demolition they would have faced in their previous locations, either through wilful destruction or neglect. Together, they represent over 700 years of history from the Midlands and a little further beyond.

The town house, windmill and granary were dismantled, restored and fully reconstructed by Gunolt Daniel Greiner (born 1915 in Jugenheim) and his son Francis Benedict Joseph Greiner. These were the only buildings restored by him in Avoncroft. They then also dismantled, restored and fully reconstructed other 15th century buildings at various open-air museums in England, for example the Bayleaf house and Market Guildhall at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum near Chichester. Gunolt always kept to the original style of the buildings and when the original format was unknown he would put a simple plain unembellished section. An example of this is a plain oak block stairway (demonstrated in the town house).

The buildings include industrial buildings (for example the chain shop), residential / domestic buildings (for example the prefab and toll house), religious buildings (such as the church), agricultural buildings (such as the windmill, barn and stable), buildings for entertainment (such as the cockpit) and others that don&#x27;t fit these categories (such as the cell block, earth closet and ice house).

Some of the buildings are furnished internally to present a view of life in a particular era in that building. Others are empty, or contain other display materials.

The museum also has a small objects collection which support the large objects collection. Some of these are displayed in the buildings, whilst the rest are kept in the museum store.

The museum also contains the UK&#x27;s National telephone kiosk Collection. This is the largest collection of telephone kiosks in the country and is part of the Connected Earth heritage project. There are also three fully working analogue telephone exchanges (one of them a mobile TXE2), a manual switchboard and early automatic systems. The collection shows the complete history of telephone kiosks in the UK from 1912 to the 1990s together with demonstrations of how telephone calls were routed and connected before the advent of digital technology.

==Events==
The museum has a wide and varied events programme that changes every year. Events are largely family-focussed, with some events aimed at an older adult audience. Because of the family focus, events are largely centred on bank holiday weekends and school holidays.

Events often have historical themes and feature re-enactors from various time periods, including Wars of the Roses, Victorian, and 1940s.

<text>Fiona Elizabeth Bruce (born 25 April 1964) is a British journalist, newsreader and television presenter. She joined the BBC as a researcher for their current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot; in 1989, and became the first female newsreader on &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;, as well as presenting many other flagship programmes for the corporation, including &quot;BBC News at Six&quot;, &quot;Crimewatch&quot;, &quot;Real Story&quot;, &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; and &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot; Since 10 January 2019, she has been the presenter of the BBC One television programme &quot;Question Time&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Fiona Elizabeth Bruce was born on 25 April 1964 in what was then the State of Singapore, Malaysia. She had an English mother and a Scottish father, who had a long career at Unilever, becoming a regional managing director. Before that, the Bruce family had lived for several generations in the fishing village of Hopeman in Moray in the north-east of Scotland. Bruce has two elder brothers. She was educated at Gayton Primary School on the Wirral, the International School of Milan, and then, from the age of 14 until 18, attended Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham College in New Cross, London. During the latter period she modelled for the stories in the teenage girls&#x27; magazine &quot;Jackie&quot;.

Bruce&#x27;s great-grandfather, Frederick Crouch, died in fighting on the Western Front in World War I.

Bruce read French and Italian at Hertford College, Oxford. During that period, she was briefly a punk, singing in rock bands and, at one point, colouring her hair blue for one week. She graduated with an upper second-class honours degree. She attended the University of London Institute in Paris as a scholar and is a fluent speaker of Italian and French.

==Career==
After leaving university, Bruce joined a management consulting firm for a year, but found the experience dull. After that, she worked at a number of advertising agencies, including Boase Massimi Pollitt, where she met her future husband, a company director. She then went on to meet Tim Gardam – at that time the editor of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; – at a wedding and, in 1989, he gave her a job as a researcher on the programme.

===News and current affairs===
After becoming an assistant producer on &quot;Panorama&quot;, she made the change to reporting in 1992 on &quot;Breakfast News&quot;. She then moved to BBC South East, appearing as an occasional presenter and reporter on &quot;Newsroom South East&quot; and a weekly current affairs programme, &quot;First Sight&quot;. From 1994 to 1995, she was a reporter on the BBC2 current affairs programme &quot;Public Eye&quot;. She then reported for &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot;; she was also a presenter of Newsnight between 1995 and 1998. She then moved to presenting &quot;Breakfast News&quot; and the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; in 1996. 

In 1999, as part of a major relaunch of the BBC&#x27;s news output, Bruce was named secondary presenter of the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. She presented the programme as a cover for the main presenter Huw Edwards, as well as regularly on Fridays, until a presenter reshuffle in January 2003, to coincide with the retirement of Michael Buerk and the move of Peter Sissons to the BBC News channel. Both Bruce and Edwards moved to the &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and both presented the programme, until the suspension of Huw Edwards by the BBC in July 2023. Bruce continues to present the &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (now known as the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;).

Bruce was the first female presenter of the bulletin. In 2007, Bruce returned to presenting the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot;. After an eleven-year tenure, she stepped down from the Friday editions of the programme (which she was presenting at the time) in January 2019. 

From 2003 to 2007, Bruce presented and reported in the BBC One current affairs series &quot;Real Story&quot;.

Following the murder of Jill Dando, Bruce took over the position of co-presenter on &quot;Crimewatch&quot; alongside Nick Ross, until both were replaced by Kirsty Young towards the end of 2007. In 2001, Bruce became one of the presenters of the BBC general election results programme.

In 2006, following a court case involving British Airways requesting that a Christian employee conceal her cross because it infringed the airline&#x27;s dress code, the BBC disclosed it had some concerns over the fact that Bruce often wore a cross necklace, although she was not banned from doing so.

On 10 January 2019, Bruce succeeded long-time host David Dimbleby on the BBC&#x27;s debate programme &quot;Question Time&quot; as the first full-time female host. Her tenure as host was almost immediately embroiled in controversy, and in May 2020, Bruce stated &quot;QT is without doubt the hardest job I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

In 2023, during an episode of &quot;Question Time&quot;, when journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown claimed that Stanley Johnson, the father of former British prime minister Boris Johnson, had broken his wife&#x27;s nose, Bruce interrupted to comment that Johnson&#x27;s friends had said that the incident occurred, but was a &quot;one-off&quot;. Following the episode, Labour MP Kate Osborne, and chief executive of domestic violence charity Women&#x27;s Aid, Farah Nazeer, among others, criticised the comment, saying that it downplayed domestic violence. The BBC defended Bruce, commenting that, as the host, she had a duty to present an avenue of reply by accused parties and it was not her personal comment. Bruce apologised for her comments after the incident and said that she was &quot;required to legally contextualise&quot; the statement, and that her comments were &quot;not&quot; reflective of her own opinions. Bruce subsequently resigned as an ambassador for the domestic violence charity Refuge, a role she had been in for over 25 years. 

Following an October edition of the show from Wolverhampton, also in 2023, Bruce apologised to an audience member for identifying him as &quot;the black guy&quot; on air.

In May 2024 Bruce sparked further controversy during a BBC &quot;Question Time&quot; broadcast from Aberdeen when, after persistently interrupting Stephen Flynn MP, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, and after remaining silent while Flynn was interrupted by other panel members, Bruce again interrupted Flynn and incorrectly said &quot;you&#x27;ve interrupted everybody here,&quot; sparking laughter from the audience. After Flynn was interrupted nearly 40 times in the programme, the BBC was accused of having a &quot;general antipathy&quot; towards the SNP. This seeming antipathy was apparently confirmed when on a subsequent programme Bruce again persistently interrupted an SNP representative on the &quot;Question Time&quot; panel, this time Deputy First Minister of Scotland Kate Forbes, resulting in 145 complaints to the BBC.

===Other programmes===
In September 1998, Bruce became the presenter for BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Show&quot;, which was in its fourth series. She presented it for a further two series, showing her interest in presenting antiques programmes nearly a decade before presenting &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. On 22 June 2007, it was announced that Bruce was to replace the retiring Michael Aspel as presenter of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; the following spring, which initially caused some controversy. However, average viewership increased during Bruce&#x27;s first year as presenter.

In 2007, Bruce wrote and presented a BBC documentary about Cherie Blair as Tony Blair left office.

Bruce also occasionally presented special editions of &quot;The Money Programme&quot;. In one, she profiled the entrepreneur Alan Sugar. She said of the experience: &quot;It was a bit like being in front of a hair dryer at very close quarters. He&#x27;s not backwards in coming forward in his opinions.&quot; During the documentary, Bruce – who has always publicly identified herself as a feminist – challenged Sugar&#x27;s view that women should openly disclose their childcare commitments to a potential employer. Her point was that if men were not required to declare their ability to meet the demands of their job, it was not right that women should do so.

&quot;Victoria: A Royal Love Story&quot; (2010) is a BBC documentary, written and presented by Bruce, charting the story of the love affair between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and documenting the collection of paintings, sculptures, and jewellery they gave each other.

Since 2011, she has co-hosted the BBC television series &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot; alongside Philip Mould, which involves the process of establishing the authenticity of works of art, including the use of modern techniques. In 2011, Bruce wrote and presented &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Palaces&quot;, a three-part BBC documentary telling the story of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s three official residences, Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Holyrood Palace. In 2012, Bruce wrote and presented a BBC documentary about Leonardo da Vinci.

In 2015 and 2016, she presented the BBC Four quiz programme &quot;Hive Minds&quot;. 

In 2017, it was reported that Bruce was paid between £350,000 and £400,000 as a BBC presenter. In early 2019, she stated that she did not keep track of her salary which, for 2018, was reportedly £170,000, an amount that did not include her earnings from &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;.

===Parody and humour===
Bruce was featured in an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; (series 10, episode 3), sharing a lift with one of its presenters, Jeremy Clarkson, and then having to push him out (as he was stuck in a Peel P50, which has no reverse gear). As she walked away, Clarkson commented, without her knowledge until the programme was aired, &quot;She has got quite a nice bottom... I said that out loud, didn&#x27;t I?&quot; Bruce returned to &quot;Top Gear&quot; in the next series (series 11, episode 4), alongside fellow newsreader Kate Silverton, for the &quot;Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car&quot; feature. As a comeback to the &quot;nice bottom&quot; comment, she slapped Clarkson&#x27;s and declared that it &quot;needs a bit of work&quot;. Since then, she has also occasionally stood in for a holidaying Clarkson in his &quot;Sunday Times&quot; car review column, which she referred to as the ultimate revenge: &quot;perching my bottom – nice or otherwise – on his patch.&quot;

In the BBC Two version of the satirical impressions show &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, Bruce was parodied by Jan Ravens, who ruthlessly exaggerated her mannerisms through sexual innuendo. For example: &quot;Hello, my name is Fiona Bruce sitting on the luckiest chair in Britain&quot;, and &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Fiona Bruce; don&#x27;t touch what you can&#x27;t afford.&quot;

She appeared in a tongue-in-cheek BBC HD advertisement in 2008, featuring a parody of the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, in which she drove a car through a wall, before running towards a falling vase, with the car exploding as she jumped to save the vase from crashing.

Bruce has regularly appeared on the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon, performing musical routines alongside fellow BBC newsreaders. Her rendition of &quot;All That Jazz&quot; in the 2007 edition, while performing as Velma Kelly, led the directors of the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; to invite her to the London performance of the 10th-anniversary gala, where she appeared on stage in a parade of Velmas.

Referring to Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s adoration of her – he once described her as &quot;agonisingly gorgeous&quot; – she remarked, &quot;In my twenties I was virulently opposed to anyone commenting on my appearance, lest it come at the expense of my ability. But it&#x27;s not an issue for me now. If Jeremy Clarkson pays me a compliment, then fine, how nice, &#x27;Thanks Jeremy&#x27;.&quot;

==Political causes==
Bruce has often been outspoken regarding her commitment to feminism, expressing concern at a 2006 poll that suggested almost three-quarters of women no longer saw feminism as necessary: &quot;The contradictions are still there [in society] which is why I think feminism is still very relevant for me and it&#x27;s just such a shame that it&#x27;s become a byword for mustachioed, man-hating women from Lebanon.&quot; Despite her firm views on the subject – including a &quot;disappointment&quot; in women who dislike working with other women – she claims to have softened her feminist views from her university days, where she once ran an anti-pornography campaign.

===Fathers 4 Justice controversy===
Bruce was criticised for showing &quot;blatant bias&quot; when interviewing Matt O&#x27;Connor, founder of Fathers 4 Justice, for a BBC programme in 2004. Bruce, who had featured in advertising campaigns for the charity Women&#x27;s Aid, was accused of having an axe to grind on the issue of domestic violence. Many, including O&#x27;Connor, felt she let her own personal view on domestic violence as an issue of gender take over the programme. There were also concerns that O&#x27;Connor had originally been invited to speak about CAFCASS and the Family Courts, yet the programme was changed to focus on domestic violence.

Later, a BBC committee, investigating on behalf of the BBC Governors, concluded that there were &quot;some weaknesses&quot; in the programme when considered against the BBC&#x27;s journalistic values of &quot;Truth and Accuracy, Serving the Public Interest, Impartiality and Diversity of Opinion, Independence and Accountability&quot;, but that the programme &quot;still made a valuable contribution to the debate on parental rights&quot;. Overall the committee &quot;did not think that these matters were sufficient to constitute a serious breach of editorial standards&quot; and found that &quot;the programme had provided appropriate and balanced information around the allegation that violent men had infiltrated F4J&quot;.

===Charity work===
Bruce is an honorary vice-president of optical charity Vision Aid Overseas (VAO), alongside fellow newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald. In February 2005, Bruce did the voice-over for VAO&#x27;s Lifeline Appeal. In 2007, Bruce launched VAO&#x27;s Annual Review. Later that year she was one of nine prominent women to take part in the &quot;What&#x27;s it going to take?&quot; campaign for the charity Women&#x27;s Aid.

In 2009, the NSPCC inducted her into its Hall of Fame in honour of her continued work on their behalf. In accepting the honour, she said, &quot;The work of the NSPCC and ChildLine is desperately important and I do little compared to what needs to be done. But I&#x27;m very honoured to be included in the Hall of Fame.&quot;

Bruce was ambassador for the domestic violence charity Refuge but was forced to step back from the role in 2023 when she appeared to downplay the historic incident of Stanley Johnson breaking his wife Charlotte Fawcett&#x27;s nose on Question Time. Her remarks saw well over 800 complaints to the BBC.

==Personal life==
Bruce met Nigel Sharrocks (born 1956) when he was director of the advertising agency where she worked. He is non-executive chairman of Digital Cinema Media. They married in July 1994 in Islington, London and have two children, a son born in January 1998 and a daughter born in November 2001. Their main residence is in Belsize Park, London, and they have a second home in Sydenham, Oxfordshire. In 2014, Bruce stated that she did not use social media because of the misogynistic abuse directed towards female celebrities. 

She was awarded the female Rear of the Year title in 2010, and accepted it in person. The following year, however, she declared that her acceptance of it had been &quot;hypocritical&quot; and that the award was &quot;demeaning&quot;.

<text>Taston is a hamlet in Spelsbury civil parish, about north of Charlbury and southeast of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

Taston is about north of the Akeman Street Roman road.

==Name==
The survey of English Place-Names records Taston as Thorstan in 1278–9, Thorstane in 1316, Torstone in 1492 and Taston in 1608–9.

The name element &quot;Thor&quot; is a reference to the Norse God Thor. The name element &quot;stan&quot; is from Old English &quot;stān&quot; (stone ). The toponym might be Thor stone or Thor&#x27;s stone.

==Thor Stone==
The Thor Stone is a standing stone that stands about seven-foot tall in the centre of Taston. It is a menhir, meaning that it was manhandled there by humans. A local myth maintains that the stone portrays the image of a thunderbolt, and that it was created by a thunderbolt from Thor himself. It is a scheduled monument.

==Listed buildings==
At the centre of Taston are the base and broken shaft of a Medieval preaching cross. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Middle Farmhouse is a house built of coursed rubble in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Part of the roof is of Stonesfield slate. The farmstead has a four-bay barn that was built of stone early in the 18th century and altered in 1884.

The Firkins is a small house near Thorsbrook Spring. It is built of rubble and probably dates from early in the 18th century.

At Thorsbrook Spring, about southeast of the preaching cross, is a Victorian Gothic Revival memorial fountain. It was built in 1862 in memory of Henrietta, Viscountess Dillon, wife of Henry Dillon, 13th Viscount Dillon.

<doc id="544286" wikidata="Q290299" url="?curid=544286" title="ADFGVX cipher">
<text>In cryptography, the ADFGVX cipher was a manually applied field cipher used by the Imperial German Army during World War I. It was used to transmit messages secretly using wireless telegraphy. ADFGVX was in fact an extension of an earlier cipher called ADFGX which was first used on 1 March 1918 on the German Western Front. ADFGVX was applied from 1 June 1918 on both the Western Front and Eastern Front.

Invented by the Germans signal corps officers Lieutenant (1891–1977) and introduced in March 1918 with the designation &quot;Secret Cipher of the Radio Operators 1918&quot; (&quot;Geheimschrift der Funker 1918&quot;, in short &quot;GedeFu 18&quot;), the cipher was a fractionating transposition cipher which combined a modified Polybius square with a single columnar transposition.

The cipher is named after the six possible letters used in the ciphertext: , , , , and . The letters were chosen deliberately because they are very different from one another in the Morse code. That reduced the possibility of operator error.

Nebel designed the cipher to provide an army on the move with encryption that was more convenient than trench codes but was still secure. In fact, the Germans believed the ADFGVX cipher was unbreakable.

== Operation ==
For the plaintext message, &quot;Attack at once&quot;, a secret mixed alphabet is first filled into a 5 × 5 Polybius square:

 and have been combined to make the alphabet fit into a 5 × 5 grid.

By using the square, the message is converted to fractionated form:

The first letter of each ciphertext pair is the row, and the second ciphertext letter is the column, of the plaintext letter in the grid (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;AF&quot; means &quot;row A, column F, in the grid&quot;).

Next, the fractionated message is subject to a columnar transposition. The message is written in rows under a transposition key (here &quot;CARGO&quot;):

 C A R G O
 _________
 A F A D A
 D A F G F
 D X A F A
 D D F F X
 G F X F

Next, the letters are sorted alphabetically in the transposition key (changing CARGO to ACGOR) by rearranging the columns beneath the letters along with the letters themselves:

 A C G O R
 _________
 F A D A A
 A D G F F
 X D F A A
 D D F X F
 F G F X

Then, it is read off in columns, in keyword order, which yields the ciphertext:
 FAXDF ADDDG DGFFF AFAX AFAFX
In practice, the transposition keys were about two dozen characters long. Long messages sent in the ADFGX cipher were broken into sets of messages of different and irregular lengths to make it invulnerable to multiple anagramming. Both the transposition keys and the fractionation keys were changed daily.

== ADFGVX ==
In June 1918, an additional letter, , was added to the cipher. That expanded the grid to 6 × 6, allowing 36 characters to be used. That allowed the full alphabet (instead of combining and ) and the digits from to . This mainly had the effect of considerably shortening messages containing many numbers.

The cipher is based on the 6 letters ADFGVX. In the following example the alphabet is coded with the Dutch codeword &quot;. This results in the alphabet: NACHTBOMEWRPDFGIJKLQSUVXYZ. Digits are inserted after the first occurrences of the letters A (1), B (2) to J (0). This creates the table below with the letters ADFGVX as column headings and row identifiers:

The text &#x27;attack at 1200am&#x27; translates to this:
Then, a new table is created with a key as a heading; the following example uses &#x27;PRIVACY&#x27; as a key, but usually much longer keys or even phrases were used.
The columns are sorted alphabetically, based on the keyword, and the table changes to this:
Then, appending the columns to each other results in this ciphertext:

DGDD DAGD DGAF ADDF DADV DVFA ADVX

With the keyword, the columns can be reconstructed and placed in the correct order. When using the original table containing the secret alphabet, the text can be deciphered.

This cipher might be modified by transposing the rows as well as the columns, creating a harder but improved cipher.

== Cryptanalysis ==

ADFGVX was cryptanalysed by French Army Lieutenant Georges Painvin, and the cipher was broken in early June 1918. The work was exceptionally difficult by the standards of classical cryptography, and Painvin became physically ill during the process. His method of solution relied on finding messages with stereotyped beginnings, which would fractionate them and then form similar patterns in the positions in the ciphertext that had corresponded to column headings in the transposition table. (Considerable statistical analysis was required after that step had been reached, all done by hand.) It was thus effective only during times of very high traffic, but that was also when the most important messages were sent.

However, that was not the only trick that Painvin used to crack the ADFGX cipher. He also used repeating sections of ciphertext to derive information about the likely length of the key that was being used. Where the key was an even number of letters in length he knew, by the way the message was enciphered, that each column consisted entirely of letter coordinates taken from the top of the Polybius Square or from the left of the Square, not a mixture of the two. Also, after substitution but before transposition, the columns would alternately consist entirely of &quot;top&quot; and &quot;side&quot; letters. One of the characteristics of frequency analysis of letters is that while the distributions of individual letters may vary widely from the norm, the law of averages dictates that groups of letters vary less. With the ADFGX cipher, each &quot;side&quot; letter or &quot;top&quot; letter is associated with five plaintext letters. In the example above, the &quot;side&quot; letter &quot;D&quot; is associated with the plaintext letters &quot;d h o z k&quot;, and the &quot;top&quot; letter &quot;D&quot; is associated with the plaintext letters &quot;t h f j r&quot;. Since the two groups of five letters have different cumulative frequency distributions, a frequency analysis of the &quot;D&quot; letter in columns consisting of &quot;side&quot; letters has a distinctively different result from those of the &quot;D&quot; letter in columns consisting of &quot;top&quot; letters. That trick allowed Painvin to guess which columns consisted of &quot;side&quot; letters and which columns consisted of &quot;top&quot; letters. He could then pair them up and perform a frequency analysis on the pairings to see if the pairings were only noise or corresponding to plaintext letters. Once he had the proper pairings, he could then use frequency analysis to figure out the actual plaintext letters. The result was still transposed, but to unscramble a simple transposition was all that he still had to do. Once he determined the transposition scheme for one message, he would then be able to crack any other message that was enciphered with the same transposition key.

Painvin broke the ADFGX cipher in April 1918, a few weeks after the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. As a direct result, the French army discovered where Erich Ludendorff intended to attack. The French concentrated their forces at that point, which has been claimed to have stopped the Spring Offensive.

However, the claim that Painvin&#x27;s breaking of the ADFGX cipher stopped the German spring offensive of 1918, while frequently made, is disputed by some. In his 2002 review of Sophie de Lastours&#x27; book on the subject, &quot;La France gagne la guerre des codes secrets 1914-1918&quot;, in the Journal of Intelligence History, (&quot;Journal of Intelligence History&quot;: volume 2, Number 2, Winter 2002) Hilmar-Detlef Brückner stated:

Regrettably, Sophie de Lastours subscribes to the traditional French view that the solving of a German ADFGVX-telegram by Painvin at the beginning of June 1918 was decisive for the Allied victory in the First World War because it gave timely warning of a forthcoming German offensive meant to reach Paris and to inflict a critical defeat on the Allies. However, it has been known for many years, that the German &quot;Gneisenau&quot; attack of 11 June was staged to induce the French High Command to rush in reserves from the area up north, where the Germans intended to attack later on.

Its aim had to be grossly exaggerated, which the German High Command did by spreading rumors that the attack was heading for Paris and beyond; the disinformation was effective and apparently still is. However, the German offensive was not successful because the French had enough reserves at hand to stop the assault and so did not need to bring in additional reinforcements.

Moreover, it is usually overlooked that the basic version of the ADFGVX cipher had been created especially for the German Spring Offensive in 1918, meant to deal the Allies a devastating blow. It was hoped that the cipher ADFGX would protect German communications against Allied cryptographers during the assault, which happened.

Telegrams in ADFGX appeared for the first time on 5 March, and the German attack started on 21 March. When Painvin presented his first solution of the code on 5 April, the German offensive had already petered out.

The ADFGX and ADFGVX ciphers are now regarded as insecure.

<doc id="544292" wikidata="Q1054464" url="?curid=544292" title="Century Series">
<text>The Century Series is a popular name for a group of US fighter aircraft representing models designated between F-100 and F-106 which went into full production. They included the first successful supersonic aircraft designs in the United States Air Force&#x27;s service, which remained in active service well into the 1970s and 1980s with the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. Three later variants, the QF-100, QF-102, and QF-106, also continued in service, primarily as aerial target drones, until the late 1990s. The F-104G stayed in service with the Italian military until 2004. The NASA airborne science program maintains a group of F-104G in airworthy condition for use as test platforms and chase aircraft.

==Century Series aircraft==
The name &quot;Century Series&quot; stems from the fighter (F-) designation number being in the 100–109 range. The term became popular to refer to a group of generally similar designs of the 1950s and early 1960s.

As it evolved, the attribution of the Century Series moniker reflects models designated between F-100 and F-106 which went into full production:
* North American F-100 Super Sabre
* McDonnell F-101 Voodoo
* Convair F-102 Delta Dagger
* Lockheed F-104 Starfighter
* Republic F-105 Thunderchief
* Convair F-106 Delta Dart

The term &quot;Century Series&quot; does not include less successful models between the F-100 and F-109 that did not go past design or prototype stage: the Republic XF-103 and North American XF-108 Rapier interceptor concepts, the North American F-107 tactical fighter prototype (cancelled in favor of the F-105), and designation &quot;F-109&quot; which was originally assigned to the F-101B Voodoo and later requested but not granted for the Bell XF-109 VTOL concept.

The F- series number sequence used in USAF was a continuation of the pre-USAF pursuit aircraft (P- series) numbering, stretching back as far as to the 1920s. The numbering would continue sequentially up to the General Dynamics F-111, and after this number, the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system restarted the numbering back from 1. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter-bomber was briefly known as the F-110 Spectre. The USAF continued the naming convention with the Constant Peg program as an operations security measure. The last known aircraft with an F-1xx designation is the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft, which is unrelated to other F-1xx aircraft but received the designation as an additional layer of obscuration for this highly secretive program.

===Characteristics===
The Century Series aircraft represented a mix of fighter-bombers (F-100, F-101A, F-105) and pure interceptors (F-101B, F-102, F-104, F-106).

The unifying characteristic of the Century Series aircraft was advanced performance and avionics when they were introduced. The F-100 was the first aircraft in the USAF capable of exceeding the speed of sound in level flight. The F-101 was the first aircraft in the USAF capable of exceeding 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h). The F-102 was the first aircraft in the world to utilize area rule in its design. The F-104 was the first combat aircraft capable of Mach 2 flight, and the only aircraft in history to simultaneously hold the world speed, rate-of climb and altitude records. Three of the Century Series aircraft—F-101, F-102, and F-106—were armed with nuclear air-to-air missiles. These weapons, designed to destroy incoming nuclear-armed Soviet bombers even when not scoring a clear hit (due to the nuclear explosion radius, shock wave, and radiation burst), were the only nuclear weapons in the USAF arsenal at the time to be under sole control of their pilots (during a mission).

Similar advancements were made in this period by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps with the Douglas F4D Skyray (later F-6), Vought F8U Crusader and F4H Phantom II carrier-based aircraft, but US Naval Aviation lacked a similar naming group.

<doc id="544294" wikidata="Q1755539" url="?curid=544294" title="City Beautiful movement">
<text>The City Beautiful movement was a reform philosophy of North American architecture and urban planning that flourished during the 1890s and 1900s with the intent of introducing beautification and monumental grandeur in cities. It was a part of the progressive social reform movement in North America under the leadership of the upper-middle class, which was concerned with poor living conditions in all major cities. The movement, which was originally associated mainly with Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City and Washington, D.C., promoted beauty not only for its own sake, but also to create moral and civic virtue among urban populations.

Advocates of the philosophy believed that such beautification could promote a harmonious social order that would increase the quality of life, while critics would complain that the movement was overly concerned with aesthetics at the expense of social reform; Jane Jacobs referred to the movement as an &quot;architectural design cult.&quot;

==History==
===Origins and effect===
The movement began in the United States in response to crowding in tenement districts, a consequence of high birth rates, increased immigration and internal migration of rural populations into cities. The movement flourished for several decades, and in addition to the construction of monuments, it also achieved great influence in urban planning that endured throughout the 20th century, particularly in regard to United States public housing projects. The &quot;Garden City&quot; movement in Britain influenced the contemporary planning of some newer suburbs of London, and there was cross-influence between the two aesthetics, one based in formal garden plans and urbanization schemes and the other, with its &quot;semi-detached villas&quot; evoking a more rural atmosphere.

===Architectural idioms===

The particular architectural style of the movement borrowed mainly from the contemporary Beaux-Arts and neoclassical architectures, which emphasized the necessity of order, dignity, and harmony.

===World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition===
The first large-scale elaboration of the City Beautiful occurred in Chicago at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. The planning of the exposition was directed by architect Daniel Burnham, who hired architects from the eastern United States, as well as the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, to build large-scale Beaux-Arts monuments that were vaguely classical with uniform cornice height. The exposition displayed a model city of grand scale, known as the &quot;White City&quot;, with modern transport systems and no poverty visible. The exposition is credited with resulting in the large-scale adoption of monumentalism for American architecture for the next 15 years. Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s Monument Avenue is one expression of this initial phase.

===Louisiana Purchase Exposition===

The popularization begun by the World Columbian Exposition was increased by the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, held in St. Louis. Its commissioner of architects selected Franco-American architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray to be Chief of Design. Within three years he designed the following fair buildings in the prevailing Beaux Arts: the Palace of Agriculture; the cascades and colonnades; the Palace of Forestry, Fish, and Game; the Palace of Horticulture; and the Palace of Transportation. All these were widely emulated in civic projects across the United States. Shortly after the fair opened in 1904, Masqueray resigned, having accepted an invitation from Archbishop John Ireland in St. Paul, Minnesota to design a cathedral there in the Beaux-Arts style. Other celebrated architects of the fair&#x27;s buildings—notably Cass Gilbert who designed the Palace of the Fine Arts, now the Saint Louis Art Museum, applied City Beautiful ideas from the exposition throughout their careers.

===McMillan Plan===

An early use of the City Beautiful ideal with the intent of creating social order through beautification was the McMillan Plan (1902), named for Michigan Senator James McMillan. The plan emerged from the U.S. Senate Park Commission&#x27;s redesigning of the monumental core of Washington, D.C., to commemorate the city&#x27;s centennial and to fulfill unrealized aspects of the city plan of Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant a century earlier.

The Washington, D.C., planners, which included Burnham, Saint-Gaudens, Charles McKim of McKim, Mead, and White, and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., visited many of the great cities of Europe. They hoped to make Washington, D.C., monumental and green like the European capitals of the era; they believed that state-organized beautification could lend legitimacy to government during a time of social disturbance in the United States. The essence of the plan surrounded the United States Capitol with monumental government buildings to replace &quot;notorious slum communities&quot;. At the heart of the design was the creation of the National Mall and eventually included Burnham&#x27;s Washington Union Station. The implementation of the plan was interrupted by World War I, but resumed after the war, culminating in the construction of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922.

===Influence in other cities===

The success of the City Beautiful philosophy in Washington, D.C., is credited with influencing subsequent plans for beautification of many other cities, including Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland (The Mall), Columbus (with the axis along State Street from the Ohio State Capitol building east to the Metropolitan Library and west to the Scioto River), Des Moines, Denver, Detroit (the Cultural Center, Belle Isle and Outer Drive), Jersey City (City Hall, Hudson County Courthouse, Dickinson High School, Lincoln Park and Dr. Leonard J. Gordon Park), Madison (with the axis from the capitol building through State Street and to the University of Wisconsin campus), Montreal, New York City (notably the Manhattan Municipal Building), Philadelphia (the Benjamin Franklin Parkway museum district between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art), Pittsburgh (the Schenley Farms district in the Oakland neighborhood of parks, museums, and universities), San Antonio (San Antonio River development), San Francisco (manifested by its Civic Center), and the Washington State Capitol Campus in Olympia, and the University of Washington&#x27;s Rainier Vista in Seattle. In Wilmington, Delaware, it inspired the creation of Rodney Square and the surrounding civic buildings. In New Haven, Connecticut, John Russell Pope developed a plan for Yale University that eliminated substandard housing and relocated the urban poor to the peripheries. Kansas City, Missouri, and Dallas undertook the installation of parkways and parks under the influence of the movement. The City Beautiful philosophy was also heavily incorporated into Florida cities, such as in Coral Gables and Orlando.

====Chicago====
Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Plan of Chicago is considered one of principal documents of the City Beautiful movement. The plan featured a dynamic new civic center, axial streets, and a lush strip of parkland for recreation alongside the city&#x27;s lakefront. Of these, only the lakefront park was implemented to any significant degree.

In 1913, the City of Chicago appointed a commission with a mandate to &quot;make Chicago Beautiful.&quot; As part of the plan, the Pennsylvania Union Railroad Depot was to be moved to the west side of the city and replaced with a new modern depot. The West Side Property Owner’s Association was among those that objected. As reported by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the association’s attorney Sidney Adler of Loeb &amp; Adler said, &quot;As I saw the beautiful picture of the city beautiful we will have fountains in West Madison Street, with poets and poetesses walking along Clinton, and the simple minded residents of the west side, after work is done, will take their gondolas and row on the limpid bosom of the Chicago River idlely strumming guitars.&quot;

====Coral Gables====
Planned out as a suburb of Miami in the early 1920s by George Edgar Merrick during the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Coral Gables was developed entirely upon the City Beautiful movement, with obelisks, fountains, and monuments seen in street roundabouts, parks, city buildings and around the city. Today, Coral Gables is one of Miami&#x27;s most expensive suburban communities, long known for its strict zoning regulations which preserve the City Beautiful elements along with its Mediterranean Revival architecture style, which is prevalent throughout the city. Coral Gables has many parks and a heavy tree canopy with an urban forest planted largely in the 1920s.

====Denver====
In Denver, Colorado, Mayor Robert W. Speer endorsed City Beautiful planning, with a plan for a Civic Center, disposed along a grand esplanade that led to the Colorado State Capitol. The plan was partly realized, on a reduced scale, with the Greek amphitheater, Voorhies Memorial and the Colonnade of Civic Benefactors, completed in 1919. The Andrew Carnegie Foundation funded the Denver Public Library (1910), which was designed as a three-story Greek Revival temple with a colossal Ionic colonnade across its front; inside it featured open shelves, an art gallery and a children&#x27;s room. Monuments and vistas were an essential feature of City Beautiful urban planning: in Denver, Paris-trained American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies was commissioned to design a monument marking the end of the Smoky Hill Trail. The bronze Indian guide he envisaged was vetoed by the committee and replaced with an equestrian Kit Carson.

====Harrisburg====
Harrisburg&#x27;s movement of beautification and improvement was one of the early and more successful urban reform movements in the U.S. It began when local minded residents became convinced that their city was unattractive, unhealthy, and filthy, and lacked the appearance and facilities appropriate to its status as Pennsylvania&#x27;s state capital. The causes of the city&#x27;s defects were well known: industrialization in the previous half century had left the city poorly planned with unpaved streets and undeveloped water management systems. Residents of Harrisburg suffered disease and illnesses caused by the lack of good filtration systems that could filter the sewage dumped by populations further up the Susquehanna River. A disastrous fire that consumed the state capitol in 1897 had spawned new conversation about the suitability of Harrisburg as a state capital.

The improvement campaign was sparked by a riveting speech of conservationist Mira Lloyd Dock to the Harrisburg Board of Trade on December 20, 1900. Dock wanted to publicly challenge the horrific conditions in Harrisburg, and she set out to gain public sentiment in support of changing them. 
Dock’s speech was titled &quot;The City Beautiful&quot; or &quot;Improvement Work at Home and Abroad&quot;, and this was the starting point for Harrisburg’s city improvements. Dock’s contemporary and closest ally in her drive for urban beautification was J. Horace McFarland, who was the president of the American Civic Association. With McFarland and Dock working together, they were able to push the process of municipal improvement in Harrisburg by convincing prominent community leaders to donate money, and by gathering the support of the majority of citizens. In April 1901, the Harrisburg Telegraph, a city newspaper, published a front-page article on the city’s problems, which stressed Dock’s message of beautification and recreation, paved streets, clean water, a city hall, land for parks, and a covered sewer interceptor along the river. The following February 1901, the population voted in favor of a bond issue that funded $1.1 million in new constructions and city planning. These improvements, combined with a new state capitol building in 1906, quickly transformed Harrisburg into a proud modern city by 1915.

====Louisville====
After the Southern Exposition of 1883–1887, Louisville grew rapidly with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Specifically, the Old Louisville neighborhood, that was planned and designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the image of the City Beautiful movement, became the largest Victorian neighborhood in the United States. Central Park sits in the middle of Old Louisville and is home to an annual free public Shakespeare festival. Adjacent to the park is the St. James–Belgravia Historic District which hosts the annual St. James Court Art Show every October. South of St. James Court is the University of Louisville&#x27;s Belknap Campus which is home to Grawemeyer Hall and the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law. Each of these areas of Louisville display the features of beautification and monumental grandeur that typified the City Beautiful movement of the 1890s.

====Memphis====

In Memphis, Tennessee, the City Beautiful Commission was officially established by a city ordinance on July 1, 1930, making it the first and oldest beautification commission in the nation. It was the brainchild of the mayor, E. H. Crump. The first Commission was appointed and had operating expenses of $1,500. A small office was set up in The Nineteenth Century Club. Mrs. E. G. Willingham was chosen as chairman and Mrs. William B. Fowler served as vice chairman. In 1935, the Riverside Drive project was dedicated. Costing nearly $1,000,000 (largely WPA funds) the City Beautiful Commission landscaped the bluffs with crape myrtle, redbuds, magnolias, dogwoods and Paul Scarlet roses. White roses were planted at each guardrail post. In 1936, Mrs. William B. Fowler became chairman of the City Beautiful Commission and served for many years. City Beautiful grew under her leadership and soon had to relocate to larger headquarters. Through the efforts of City Beautiful, Memphis gained the title of cleanest city in Tennessee in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946. Memphis also received the Ernest T. Trigg &quot;Nation’s Cleanest City&quot; award in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951. During this time, volunteers were organized into Wards and Block Clubs with Ward Chairmen and Block Captains. The City Beautiful staff grew to include 30 inspectors by 1954 who worked through these organizations to identify and improve eyesores. Memphis participated with the American Coatings Association headquartered in Washington, D.C. In 1978, the Commission was reorganized, eliminating the field inspectors. In February 1989, the Commission moved to its present location at The Massey House in Victorian Village, Memphis.

====Orlando====
According to the author Even Bacon in his book &quot;“Orlando: A Centennial History,”&quot; Orange County sent a group of agricultural exhibitors to the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. This greatly influenced city officials and planners at the turn of the century in incorporating diverse trees (such as oak trees, Palm trees, and azaleas) and other natural fixtures into the city&#x27;s design. 

With the arrival of the middle-aged couple William S. and Jessie Branch from Parker, South Dakota, in 1903, led to the creation of brochures extolling the virtues of Florida and its climate, highlighting from the Orlando area. Five years later, the city sponsored a contest to replace Orlando’s nickname which was previously “Phenomenal City”, in response to the city&#x27;s beautifications efforts. Out of the many suggestions, the proposed nickname “The City Beautiful” was chosen and adopted.

The city has since continued in their preservation and revitalization of its natural habitat in its city design, notably at Lake Eola Park and at Leu Gardens.

====Palos Verdes Estates====
In the 1920s, Palos Verdes Estates, California, was established as a master planned community by noted American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. The community was designed as a &quot;City Beautiful.&quot; Among its early structures were the buildings comprising Malaga Cove Plaza, designed in a Mediterranean Revival style popular with the City Beautiful movement.

== In Australia ==
Both European and North American cities provided models for the Australian City Beautiful movement. A combination of elements about 1900 also influenced the movement:
* It was thought that Australia, being a country that was relatively newly settled by Europeans, had wasted an opportunity to design cities comprehensively and aesthetically.
* Australian cities were seen as lacking beauty and civic pride.
* The lack of architectural features, and extensive street advertising, were also concerns. This was attributed to &quot;materialism, apathy, short-sightedness, political interference and indifference&quot;.
* Utopian city plans were another influence on the Australian City Beautiful movement. A better Brisbane, for example, was described by Louis Esson and illustrated by Lloyd Rees with a Parisian influence.

However, City Beautiful was not solely concerned with aesthetics. The term ‘beautility’ derived from the American city beautiful philosophy, which meant that the beautification of a city must also be functional. Beautility, including the proven economic value of improvements, influenced Australian town planning.

There were no formal city beautiful organisations that led this movement in Australia; rather it was influenced by communications among professionals and bureaucrats, in particular architect-planners and local government reformers. In the early Federation era some influential Australians were determined that their cities be progressive and competitive. Adelaide was used as an Australian example of the &quot;benefits of comprehensive civic design&quot; with its ring of parklands. Beautification of the city of Hobart, for example, was considered a way to increase the city’s popularity as a tourist destination.

===Canberra===

Walter Burley Griffin incorporated City Beautiful principles for his design for Canberra. Griffin was influenced by Washington, D.C., &quot;with grand axes and vistas and a strong central focal point: with specialised centres and, being a landscape architect, used the landscape to complement this layout. John Sulman, however, was Australia&#x27;s &quot;leading proponent&quot; of the City Beautiful movement and, in 1921, wrote the book &quot;An Introduction to Australian City Planning&quot;. Both the City Beautiful and the Garden City philosophies were represented by Sulman’s &quot;geometric or contour controlled&quot; designs of the circulatory road systems in Canberra. The widths of pavements were also reduced and vegetated areas were increased, such as planted road verges.

===Melbourne===

Melbourne’s grid plan was considered dull and monotonous by some people, and so the architect William Campbell designed a blueprint for the city. The main principle behind this were diagonal streets, providing sites for new and comprehensive architecture and for special buildings. The designs of Paris and Washington were major inspirations for this plan.

===City Beautiful in Australia today===
World War I prolonged the City Beautiful movement in Australia, where more memorials were erected than in any other country. Although City Beautiful, or artistic planning, became a part of comprehensive town planning, the Great Depression of the 1930s largely ended this fashion.

<text>The parish of Trinity Church has three separate burial grounds associated with it in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The first, Trinity Churchyard, is located in Lower Manhattan at 74 Trinity Place, near Wall Street and Broadway. Alexander Hamilton and his wife Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, Albert Gallatin, and Robert Fulton are buried in the downtown Trinity Churchyard.

The second Trinity parish burial ground is the [[St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel]] Churchyard, which is also located in lower Manhattan (roughly ), six blocks north of Trinity Church. It was established in 1766. Both of these churchyards are closed to new burials.

Trinity&#x27;s third place of burial, Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum, located in Hamilton Heights in Upper Manhattan, is one of the few active burial sites in Manhattan. Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum is listed on the National Register of Historic places and is the burial place of notable people including John James Audubon, John Jacob Astor IV, Mayor Edward I. Koch, Governor John Adams Dix, Ralph Ellison, and Eliza Jumel. In 1823, all burials south of Canal Street became forbidden by New York City due to city crowding, yellow fever, and other public health fears.

After considering locations in the Bronx and portions of the then-new Green-Wood Cemetery, in 1842 Trinity Parish purchased the plot of land now bordered by 153rd Street, 155th Street, Amsterdam Avenue, and Riverside Drive to establish the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum. The cemetery is located beside the Chapel of the Intercession that Audubon co-founded in 1846, but this chapel is no longer part of Trinity parish. James Renwick, Jr., is the architect of Trinity Church Cemetery and further updates were made by Calvert Vaux. The uptown cemetery is also the center of the Heritage Rose District of New York City.

A no-longer-extant Trinity Parish burial ground was the Old Saint John&#x27;s Burying Ground for St. John&#x27;s Chapel. This location is bounded by Hudson, Leroy and Clarkson streets near Hudson Square. It was in use from 1806 to 1852 with over 10,000 burials, mostly poor and young. In 1897, it was turned into St. John&#x27;s Park, with most of the burials left in place. The park was later renamed Hudson Park, and is now James J. Walker Park. (This park is different from a separate St. John&#x27;s Park, a former private park and residential block approximately one mile to the south that now serves as part of the Holland Tunnel access.)

In the northeast corner stands the Soldiers&#x27; Monument, with a plaque reading: &quot;At a meeting of Citizens held at the City Hall of the City of New York June 8, 1852: It was resolved That the Erection of a becoming Monument with appropriate inscriptions by Trinity Church to the Memory of those great and good Men who died whilst in Captivity in the old Sugar House and were interred in Trinity Church Yard in this City will be an act gratifying not only to the attendants of this Meeting but to Every American Citizen.&quot;

The claim those prisoners are buried in Trinity Churchyard is disputed by Charles I. Bushnell, who argued in 1863 that Trinity Church would not have accepted them because it supported Great Britain. Historian Edwin G. Burrows explains how the controversy related to a proposal to build a public street through the churchyard.

<doc id="544303" wikidata="Q7030309" url="?curid=544303" title="Nicollet Mall">
<text>Nicollet Mall ( ) is a twelve-block portion of Nicollet Avenue running through Downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It is a shopping and dining district of the city, and also a pedestrian mall and transit mall. Along with Hennepin Avenue to the west, Nicollet Mall forms the cultural and commercial center of Minneapolis.

Several notable Minneapolis buildings line the Mall, including the IDS Center, the former Dayton&#x27;s flagship store, Orchestra Hall, the Minneapolis Central Library, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. The studios and offices of CBS-TV affiliate WCCO are on the southern part of the Mall. Several major companies have their headquarters along the Mall, including Target Corporation and US Bank.

==History==
By the beginning of the 20th century, Nicollet Avenue had defined itself as the city&#x27;s primary shopping street, as department stores such as G.W. Hale Dry Goods Co. (opening 1867), Donaldson&#x27;s (1881), and Dayton&#x27;s (1902) all opened on this stretch. Elizabeth Quinlan, the first woman clothing buyer in the country, opened her store in the Young–Quinlan Building, also on Nicollet.

The first commercial district in Minneapolis centered on the intersection of Nicollet and Hennepin Avenues, an area known as Bridge Square and later the Gateway District. As the city grew and the area became more congested, businesses started moving south from Washington Avenue. When Bridge Square arose in 1906, residents bought hay, dry goods, and supplies at the city market and small stores on Hennepin and Nicollet. Gateway Park replaced the Square in 1913, a green center with a classical pavilion, but was later razed in 1953. Until demolition began in 1959, most of Gateway District remained: a notorious skid row, two parks, large commercial buildings, and hundreds of businesses. The district was seen as suffering from social problems due to the number of flophouses, pawnshops, burlesque theaters, and bars in addition to a high crime rate.

With hopes to solve these problems, city officials began ordering improvements on the area in the 1950s, culminating in the Gateway Center Urban Renewal project, which was approved in 1958 by unanimous City Council vote. Demolition began in 1959. Simultaneously, American shopping habits had begun changing in the mid-20th century, resulting in shopping centers moving to the suburbs. Southdale Center, the nation&#x27;s first modern enclosed shopping mall, opened in neighboring Edina in 1956. In response, several efforts were undertaken in order to help downtown compete for retail. One was the construction of the renowned skyway system; the second was the creation of Nicollet Mall.

In 1962 the Downtown Council adopted a plan for the mall that was approved by the Minneapolis City Council. The project began construction in 1967 and complete in November 1967 at a cost of $3.875 million. The mall was originally an eight block, 3,200 feet, stretch of Nicollet Avenue that was converted into a curving, tree-lined mall closed to automobile traffic, with an 80-foot right-of-way. The mall was later renovated in 1990 with parts of the underground portion being rebuilt at a cost of $22 million. The original mall had a curvilinear &quot;S&quot; curve alignment with a road width of 24 feet, while the renovated mall has a &quot;C&quot; curve alignment. The 1967 design was done by Lawrence Halprin Associates, while the 1990 redesign was done by BRW, Inc.
The summer of 2015 started a two-year, $50-million renovation of the mall. The improvements added additional green space, pedestrian amenities and connectivity to surroundings. The redesign was led by James Corner Field Operations who also helped design the High Line in New York City. The mall reopened in November 2017.

==Transportation==

Nicollet Mall is known as the first transit mall and pedestrian mall in the United States, and it inspired the creation of such corridors in other cities, including Portland, Oregon and Denver, Colorado. Civic and business leaders, including the Dayton Company and downtown Minneapolis business owners, were instrumental in this transition.

As a transit mall and pedestrian mall, Nicollet Mall is served by many Metro Transit buses, including several high frequency routes. Aside from buses and Metro Mobility vehicles, only bicycles, pedi-cabs and emergency vehicles are allowed on the two-lane street. With 635 trips on Routes 10, 11, 17, 18, and 25 using Nicollet Mall every weekday in 2023, the street is busiest transit corridor in Minnesota. Almost 11,000 riders get on or off buses within the corridor. Vehicle speeds on the mall are limited to 10 miles per hour.

Light rail service connects at Nicollet Mall station at 5th Street, providing access to the Metro Blue Line and Green Line. The Blue Line, opened June 2004, connects to the airport and Mall of America in Bloomington. The Green Line, opened June 2014, connects to the University of Minnesota and downtown Saint Paul. Bus rapid transit service connects at 7th-8th Street &amp; Nicollet station, providing access to both the Metro C Line and Metro D Line. The C Line, opened June 2019, connects to Brooklyn Center. The D Line, opened December 2022, connects Brooklyn Center and the Mall of America. Local Routes 10 and 18 provide a free trips along Nicollet Mall from the Minneapolis Convention Center to the Washington Avenue.

Starting in June 2023, the city of Minneapolis began exploring removing buses from Nicollet Mall and only allowing pedestrians and bicycles. The street would function as more of a public plaza with regular event programming.

The Loring Greenway links the south end of the Mall to nearby Loring Park.

==Today==
The Dayton&#x27;s department store between 7th and 8th Streets was rebranded Marshall Field&#x27;s in 2001, and then Macy&#x27;s in 2006. It closed in 2017 and was renovated as an indoor shopping mall and office space. Renamed The Dayton&#x27;s Project, the shopping center opened in 2021 with an open concept retail space on the first and second floor. In late 2019, the original Dayton&#x27;s signage, removed in 2001, was restored. The corporate descendant of Dayton&#x27;s, Target Corporation, has a large presence on the Mall, with both its corporate headquarters at 10th Street and a two-level retail store at 9th Street.

National retailers and local boutiques cluster around several locations, namely the Crystal Court, Minneapolis City Center and Gaviidae Common located on the Mall, although most of these areas have seen business departures since 2020. Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s Nicollet Mall location was the company&#x27;s only store in the Twin Cities upon its closing in 2004. Discount store Saks Off 5th remained on Nicollet Mall until 2020; it was one of the largest Saks Off 5th stores in the United States. City Center has a handful of shops like GNC. Brooks Brothers reopened on the second floor of City Center after closing its store in Bloomington at the Mall of America, and then closed in 2020. Gaviidae Center is home to the Downtown Minneapolis YMCA. Other shops are either local boutiques, specialty stores, or fast food eateries that operate almost exclusively during the weekday lunch hour. The Hyatt Regency and the Millennium Minneapolis hotels anchor the southern end of Nicollet Mall. Prominent hotels adjacent to the mall include the Westin, The Four Seasons, and the Marquette. 

Over the years, Nicollet Mall has seen the closing of several national clothing brands, including Polo Ralph Lauren and Cole Haan, which was its only store in the Twin Cities. Cole Haan relocated to the Galleria in Edina. Additional closures included Gap, Banana Republic, Men&#x27;s Wearhouse, Nordstrom Rack, and Marshall&#x27;s. The Macy&#x27;s downtown location was the division headquarters of Macy&#x27;s North from 2006 to 2008 before it was integrated into Macy&#x27;s East headquartered in New York City. Since 2000, the century-old local menswear store Hubert White has operated in the IDS Center, selling upscale men&#x27;s clothing, mainly by Ermenegildo Zegna.

In addition to Target Corporation, Fortune 500 companies U.S. Bancorp and Xcel Energy have their headquarters on Nicollet, while WCCO-TV (CBS Channel 4) is located on the southern part of the Mall. A block south of the TV station is one of the oldest buildings on the mall, Westminster Presbyterian Church. The church has been located at three locations on Nicollet since 1860.

While Nicollet Mall is no longer the retail destination it once was, future revitalization plans continue to spark discussion amongst local lawmakers and business interest groups.

==Holidazzle Parades==
The Holidazzle Parades were a series of evening parades on Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis. The parades were held from the day after Thanksgiving until a couple days before Christmas. The event started in the early 1990s to increase business for downtown stores.

Macy&#x27;s, sponsor of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City and the Celebrate the Season Parade in Pittsburgh, was a sponsor, as was Minneapolis–based Target.

In 2013, organizers announced the parades would be discontinued in favor of a new German-style Christmas market called &quot;Holidazzle Village&quot;. Located on Nicollet Mall at Peavey Plaza during its first two years, the village features live music, fireworks and local and international vendors. It moved in 2015 to Loring Park and runs during a period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

A fictionalized version of the parade appeared in the 1996 Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;Jingle All The Way&quot;. The parade event in the movie was called the &quot;Wintertainment Parade,&quot; was shown occurring during the day instead of at night, and was not shot in Minneapolis, although much of the film was shot locally.

==In popular culture==

The mall is featured in The Mighty Ducks when the team goes rollerblading.
The tam o&#x27;shanter cap toss by television character Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) in the opening credits of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; was filmed on Nicollet Mall, in front of what was then the flagship Donaldson&#x27;s department store. In 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named this scene the second greatest moment of television history. The Mall was also the setting of numerous location shots during the run of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

In May 2002, a bronze sculpture of Moore&#x27;s character, created by Gwen Gillen and commissioned by TV Land, was dedicated at the corner of 7th Street and Nicollet Mall. Gillen&#x27;s design was chosen from a group of 21 sculptors who submitted applications for the sculpture.

<doc id="544304" wikidata="Q6925062" url="?curid=544304" title="Mountain Language">
<text>Mountain Language is a one-act play written by Harold Pinter, first published in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (TLS) on 7–13 October 1988. It was first performed at the Royal National Theatre in London on 20 October 1988 with Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson. Subsequently, it was published by Faber and Faber (UK) and Grove Press (USA). &quot;Mountain Language&quot; lasts about 25 minutes in production. It was most recently performed as part of &quot;Theatre of Menace (2016)&quot; at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, starring Alisa Belonogina, Paul Carmichael, Lana O&#x27;Kell, Jaime Peacock, Louis Tappenden and Natasha Ryan

==Background==
According to a letter from Pinter to &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, where it was first published and advertised, that publication&#x27;s &quot;advertisement ... stat[ing] that the play was &#x27;inspired&#x27; by [Pinter&#x27;s] trip to Turkey with Arthur Miller and is a &quot;parable about torture and the fate of the Kurdish people&quot; ... [are] ... assertions ... made without consultation with the author [Pinter]&quot;; he continues: &quot;The first part of the sentence [that it was inspired by Pinter&#x27;s trip to Turkey with Miller] is in fact true. The play is not, however, &#x27;about the fate of the Kurdish people&#x27; and, above all it is not intended as a &#x27;parable&#x27;.&quot; As Grimes points out, &quot;Pinter evidently believes his political plays are too direct to be seen as metaphors or parables&quot; (90). As Pinter insists in that letter, the text has more universal relevance: &quot;this play is not about the Turks and the Kurds. I mean, throughout history, many languages have been banned––the Irish have suffered, the Welsh have suffered and the Urdu and the Estonians&#x27; language banned.&quot; The dialogue does contain some identifiably contemporary British or Western cultural references, thereby showing its applicability to the Great Britain of the present, but the text of the play contains no explicit geographical place setting and no explicit time setting, rendering its setting in place and time simultaneously indeterminate and thus also broadly relevant.

==Characters==
The play involves four main characters: a Young Woman (Sara Johnson), an Elderly Woman, a Hooded Man (Charley Johnson, husband of the Young Woman) and an unnamed Prisoner (son of the Elderly Woman). These characters are in stark contrast to the Officer, Sergeant and guards of the prison where the Hooded Man and the Prisoner are captives.

==Thematic relevance of language==
Like the world of Pinter&#x27;s 1984 play &quot;One for the Road&quot;, the world of this play exposes the power of language (Merritt 171–209; 275; Grimes 80–100). 
Pinter&#x27;s play may allude to political and cultural contexts of Great Britain in the 1980s headed by the Conservative Party of Margaret Thatcher, which, for example, forbade the television networks from broadcasting the voice of the leader of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams.

== Mountain Language rehearsal in Harringey, London ==
In 1996, the play Mountain Language was to be performed by Kurdish actors of the &quot;Yeni Yasam&quot; company in Harringey. The actors obtained plastic guns and military uniforms for the rehearsal. But a worried observer alarmed the police, which lead to an intervention by the police with about 50 police officers and a helicopter. The Kurdish actors were detained and forbidden to speak in Kurdish language. After a short time, the police realized they have been informed of the performance being played in Harrington, and allowed the performance to go ahead.

<doc id="544306" wikidata="Q2896924" url="?curid=544306" title="Heracleum maximum">
<text>Heracleum maximum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is the only member of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; native to North America. It is also known as American cow-parsnip, Satan celery, Indian celery, Indian rhubarb, poison turnip or pushki.

==Description==

Cow parsnip is a tall herbaceous perennial plant, reaching heights of . The stems are hollow and densely hairy. The leaves are very large, up to across and divided into three lobes. Cow parsnip has the characteristic flower umbels of the carrot family (Apiaceae), blooming from February to September. The umbels can reach across, flat-topped or rounded, and composed of small white flowers. Sometimes the outer flowers of the umbel are much larger than the inner ones. The seeds are long and wide.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;Heracleum maximum&quot; is commonly confused with &quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot; (giant hogweed), a much larger plant that typically has purplish spots on the stems, as well as more sharply serrated leaves.

Other tall invasive &quot;Heracleum&quot; species include &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot;, &quot;H. sosnowskyi&quot;, and &quot;H. persicum&quot;. Other similar species include wild carrot, cow parsley, poison hemlock, wild parsnip, and species of the genus &quot;Angelica&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The Plant List (which was last updated in 2013) classified &quot;H. maximum&quot;, &quot;H. lanatum&quot;, and &quot;H. sphondylium&quot; subsp. &quot;montanum&quot; as distinct species. According to both the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) or the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS), &quot;H. lanatum&quot; and &quot;H. maximum&quot; are synonyms for &quot;H. sphondylium&quot; subsp. &quot;montanum&quot;, a name proposed by Brummitt in 1971.

According to the Plant List and Plants of the World Online, &quot;H. lanatum&quot; and &quot;H. maximum&quot; are both accepted names, the latter with no infraspecific taxa. On the other hand, neither are recognized as accepted names by either the ITIS or NPGS. Besides &quot;H. lanatum&quot; and &quot;H. maximum&quot;, various scientific names have been attributed to this species.

Synonyms of the grouping previously classified &quot;H. lanatum&quot; include:
* &quot;Heracleum montanum&quot;
* &quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot; subsp. &quot;lanatum&quot;
* &quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot; var. &quot;lanatum&quot;
* &quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot; subsp. &quot;montanum&quot;

Synonyms listed at Plants of the World Online include:
As &quot;H. lanatum&quot;, it is listed as having the variety &quot;asiaticum&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Heracleum&quot; (from &quot;Heracles&quot;) refers to the very large size of all parts of these plants.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to North America, being distributed throughout most of the continental United States (except the Gulf Coast and a few neighboring states), ranging from the Aleutian Islands and Alaska in the far northwest to Newfoundland on the east coast, extending south as far as California, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, and Georgia. It occurs from sea level to elevations of about . It is especially prevalent in Alaska, where it is often found growing amongst plants like devil&#x27;s club, which is nearly identical in size and somewhat similar in appearance, and monkshood, a very toxic flower. In Canada, it is found in every province and territory except Nunavut. It is listed as &quot;Endangered&quot; in Kentucky and &quot;Special Concern&quot; in Tennessee. The plant is also found in Siberia, East Asia, and the Kuril Islands.

== Ecology ==
The species is widely recognized as a valuable pasture plant for cows, sheep, and goats. It is also known to be important in the diets of numerous wild animals, especially bears, both grizzly bears and black bears. It is a host plant for the black swallowtail butterfly (&quot;Papilio polyxenes&quot;), short-tailed swallowtail butterfly (&quot;Papilio brevicauda&quot;), old world swallowtail butterfly (&quot;Papilio machaon&quot;), anise swallowtail butterfly (&quot;Papilio zelicaon&quot;), and the moths &quot;Eupithecia tripunctaria&quot;, &quot;Papaipema harrisii&quot;, &quot;Papaipema impecuniosa&quot;, &quot;Agonopterix clemensella&quot;, &quot;Agonopterix flavicomella&quot;, and &quot;Depressaria pastinacella&quot;.

== Toxicity ==
The plant contains furanocoumarins such as xanthotoxin, angelicin, pimpinellin and isopimpinellin, isoimperatorin, bergapten and isobergapten, , and sphondin. In one study, the young leaves did not contain xanthotoxin, but older, senescing leaves contained &quot;substantial amounts&quot;. Some of these furanocoumarins found in cow parsnip are known to have antimicrobial properties and are responsible for a rash producing erythematous vesicles (burn-like blisters) and hyperpigmentation that occurs after getting the clear sap onto one&#x27;s skin. They are photosensitive, with the rash occurring only after exposure to ultraviolet light. Because of this, phytophotodermatitis causing skin blistering may occur after coming into contact with the sap on a sunny day. The scars and pigmentation from these blisters caused by some &quot;Heracleum&quot; species can last for months or years.

== Uses ==
The thick flower stems, coming into season in early summer, can be peeled and eaten cooked when young, as was done by Native Americans. Caution should be taken as the flowers resemble those of the extremely poisonous &quot;Cicuta maculata&quot;.

Indigenous North Americans have had a variety of uses for cow parsnip, often traveling long distances in the spring— or more—to find the succulent plant shoots. The young stems and leafstalks were peeled and usually eaten raw, while early American settlers cooked the plant. In terms of taste, texture, and nutrients, the peeled stalks resembled celery, which gave rise to the common name &quot;Indian celery&quot;. The natives were aware of the toxic effects of the plant, knowing that if the outer skin were not removed, one would get an &quot;itchy mouth&quot; or blistering skin. Pregnant women were warned away from the flower bud stalks to prevent newborns from asphyxiating when crying.

At least seven native groups in North America used the plant as a dermatological aid. It could be an ingredient in poultices applied to bruises or sores. A poultice prepared from the roots of cow parsnip was applied to swellings, especially of the feet. The dried stems were used as drinking straws for the old or infirm, or made into flutes for children. An infusion of the flowers can be rubbed on the body to repel flies and mosquitoes. A yellow dye can be made from the roots.

<doc id="544313" wikidata="Q1054921" url="?curid=544313" title="List of islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong">
<text>Hong Kong comprises the Kowloon Peninsula and 263 islands over , the largest being Lantau Island and the second largest being Hong Kong Island. Ap Lei Chau is one of the most densely populated islands in the world.

Hong Kong Island is historically the political and commercial centre of Hong Kong. It was the site of the initial settlement of Victoria City, where the financial district of Central is now located. Most of the other islands are commonly referred to as the &quot;Outlying Islands&quot;.

The Kowloon Peninsula, across Victoria Harbour from Hong Kong Island is another notable commercial centre in Hong Kong.

In terms of the districts of Hong Kong, while one of the 18 districts is called the Islands District, many islands of Hong Kong are actually not part of that district, which only consists of some twenty large and small islands in the southern and the south-western waters of Hong Kong. These islands belong to respective districts depending on their locations.
==Peninsulas==

* Kowloon Peninsula – Geographically, it refers to the area south of the mountain ranges of Beacon Hill, Lion Rock, Tate&#x27;s Cairn, Kowloon Peak, etc. and covers five districts itself. Historically, only the portion south of Boundary Street was ceded to Britain by the Convention of Peking in 1860, covering the area of only one district in its entirety (Yau Tsim Mong) and portions of two other districts (southwestern part of Kowloon City, Stonecutters Island of Sham Shui Po).

Leung Shuen Wan was connected to the mainland in the 1970s to form the High Island Reservoir. It historically had an area of 8.511 km2 and was in 1960 the 4th largest island of Hong Kong. At that time, the airport platform had not yet been built and the area of Tsing Yi increased later as a consequence of land reclamation.

The original Chek Lap Kok had an area of 3.02 km2 (other sources mention 2.8 km2). By the time when the airport was open the size of the island was cited to be 1,248 hectares.

<text>Roger David Griffin (born 31 January 1948) is a British professor of modern history and political theorist at Oxford Brookes University, England. His principal interest is the socio-historical and ideological dynamics of fascism, as well as various forms of political or religious fanaticism.

== Education and career ==
Griffin obtained a First in French and German Literature from Oxford University, then began teaching History of ideas at Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes). Becoming interested in the study of extremist right-wing movements and regimes which have shaped modern history, Griffin obtained a PhD from Oxford University in 1990. He first developed his palingenesis theory of fascism in his PhD thesis. His best known work is &quot;The Nature of Fascism&quot; (1991). In May 2011, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Leuven in recognition of his services to the comparative study of fascism.

== Research and writing ==

Griffin&#x27;s theory, set out first in &quot;The Nature of Fascism&quot; in 1991, and more recently in &quot;Fascism: An Introduction to Comparative Fascist Studies&quot; (2017), offers a heuristically useful ideal type of fascism as a form of revolutionary organic nationalist movement, or palingenetic ultranationalism. For Griffin, fascism directly mobilises popular energies or works through an elite to eventually achieve the cultural hegemony of new values and the total rebirth of the &#x27;ultranation&#x27;, whether conceived as a historic nation-state or as a race or ethnos, from what it defines as the present state of decadence. Fascism is an ideology that has assumed a large number of specific national permutations and several distinct organizational forms. Moreover, it is a political project that continues to evolve to this day throughout the Europeanized world, though it remains highly marginalised compared with the central place it occupied in inter-war Europe, and its central role in identity politics has been largely replaced by non-revolutionary forms of radical right-wing populism.

Griffin&#x27;s approach, though still highly contested in some quarters, has nonetheless influenced the comparative literature on fascism of the last 25 years, drawing on the work of George Mosse, Stanley Payne, and Emilio Gentile to highlight the revolutionary and totalising politico-cultural nature of the fascist revolution in marked contrast to Marxist approaches. His book, &quot;Modernism and Fascism&quot;, locates the mainspring of the fascist drive for national rebirth in the modernist bid to achieve an alternative modernity, which is driven by a rejection of the decadence of &#x27;actually existing modernity&#x27; under liberal democracy or tradition. The fascist attempt to institute a different civilisation and a new temporality in the West found its most comprehensive expression in the &#x27;modernist states&#x27; of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Since 1945 fascism has diversified and can no longer form a mass movement that is populist and charismatic, having been reduced instead to terroristic attacks on liberal democratic society and those it deems &#x27;enemies&#x27; of the &#x27;true&#x27; nation/race and its rebirth.

His most recent research has been on terrorism. In his &quot;Terrorist&#x27;s Creed: Fanatical Violence and the Human Need for Meaning&quot; he studies the origins and motivations behind terrorism. He compares the origins of terrorism to the extremes of the National Socialists in the 1930s, noting that &quot;fanatics&quot; separate the world into good and evil, and then undergo &quot;heroic doubling&quot; where they see themselves as warriors in the battle between good and evil.

This theme will be pursued and deepened in his next monograph &quot;The Divisible Self: Heroic Doubling and the Origins of Modern Violence&quot; (Columbia: Agenda, Columbia University Press, September 2021).

Griffin was co-founder of the open access journal &quot;Fascism&quot; (Brill) and co-founder of COMFAS, International Association for the Comparative Study of Fascism, directed by Professor Constantin Iordachi (Central European University).

Griffin has translated works by Norberto Bobbio and .

Griffin used to count trance music and rave culture among his interests. He wrote the sleeve notes for the two CD volume &quot;Return To The Source: Deep Trance &amp; Ritual Beats&quot;, explaining his liking of the genre and how it relates to society.

<text>&quot;&quot; (&quot;God Save Emperor Franz&quot;) is an anthem to the Austrian Emperor Francis II, set to music by Joseph Haydn. The anthem served as the national anthem of Austria-Hungary.

The German lyrics were written by Lorenz Leopold Haschka (1749–1827). The anthem was translated and adapted into many of the languages that were spoken in the Empire.

Tartsa Isten, óvja Isten&lt;poem lang=&quot;hu&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Tartsa Isten, óvja Isten
Királyunk s a közhazát!
Erőt lelve a szent hitben
Ossza bölcs parancsszavát!
Hadd védnünk ős koronáját
Bárhonnét fenyítse vész!
Magyar honnal Habsburg trónját
Egyesíté égi kéz.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;May God keep, may God protect
Our King and his parliament!
Finding strength in the holy faith
may it share in his wise command!
Let us protect his ancient crown
From wherever calamity would threaten it! 
Hungarian homeland with Habsburg throne
Was united by the celestial hand.&lt;/poem&gt;

Czech translation of the Austrian anthem during the reign of Franz Joseph I (1848–1916)
&lt;poem lang=&quot;cs&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Lidová hymna
Zachovej nám, Hospodine
Císaře a naši zem
Dej, ať z víry moc mu plyne
Ať je moudrým vladařem
Hajme věrně trůnu Jeho
Proti nepřátelům všem!
Osud trůnu Habsburského
Rakouska je osudem.

Plňme věrně povinnosti
Braňme právo počestně
A když třeba, s ochotností
V boj se dejme statečně
Na paměti věčné mějme
Slávu vojska vítěznou
Jmění, krev i život dejme
Za Císaře, za vlast svou!

Čeho nabyl občan pilný
Vojín zbraní zastávej
Uměním i vědou silný
Duch se vzmáhej, jasně skvěj
Bože račiž přízeň dáti
Naší vlasti milené
Slunce Tvé ať věčně svítí
Na Rakousko blažené.

Stůjme k sobě v každou chvíli
Svornost jenom moci dá
Spojené kde vládnou síly
Vše se snadno překoná
Když se ruka k ruce vine
Tak se dílo podaří
Říš Rakouská nezahyne
Sláva vlasti, Císaři!

Císaři po boku vládne
Rodem, duchem spřízněná
V kráse, která neuvadne
Císařovna vznešená
Bože račiž přízeň svoji
Habsburskému domu dát
Františkovi Josefovi
Alžbětě rač požehnat!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt; 
Bless us, oh Lord
The emperor and our land
Use our faith to give him power
Let him be our wise ruler
We shall protect his holy throne
Against all our enemies!
The destiny of the Habsburg throne
Is the destiny of Austria.

We shall follow our laws truly
We shall protect all our laws
And if needed, with all loyalty
we shall battle fearlessly
We shall remember, you gratefully
Our victorious armies
Property, blood and our lives we will give
For our Emperor, for our Empire!

What was given to good people
our soldiers should protect
Strong by knowledge, strengthened by all its art
Spirit of our lands will grow
God please wish glory to our land
God bless our loved homeland
Your light, your sun, shall light peacefully
Upon Austria, our blessed land.

Let us stand together at all times
Only unity gives power
Where united powers reign
All struggles are easier
When a hand reaches out to another
The work meets success
The Austrian Empire will not fall
Glory to our land, to the Emperor!

By the Emperor’s side
Reigns bound by spirit and house
In beauty, which doesn’t fade
The Excellent Empress
God, may you give your favour
To the Habsburg house
Francis Joseph
Elisabeth may you bless!

&lt;poem lang=&quot;hr&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Kraljevka (also called; Carevka)
Bože živi, Bože štiti
Kralja našeg i naš dom.
Vječnom Ti ih slavom kiti,
Snagom Ti ih jačaj svom.
Ti nam sretne dane množi,
Habsburškoj ih kući daj,
S njenom snagom zauvijek složi
Hrvatske nam krune sjaj.

Ti u našim stvori grud&#x27;ma
Živi ponos, krotku ćud,
Da smo mili svijem ljud&#x27;ma,
Na poštenju prvi svud.
Ti nas krijepi svojom vjerom,
Ravnaj naše sreće brod,
Da nam pođe pravim smjerom
Sav naš složan mili rod.

No kad domu zlo zaprijeti,
&quot;U boj!&quot; zovne Kraljev glas,
Tad na ovaj poziv sveti
Lavom budi svaki nas,
Da pred stijegom našim gine
Dušman svaki, Bože daj!
A nad nama s nova sine
Blagog mira vedri sjaj!

Bože živi, srećom zlati
Kraljevski nam sjajni dom,
Naša ljubav nek ga prati
Do kraj međa žiću tom;
Blago, život Kralju svome
Svaki od nas rado daj,
Vječan bud&#x27; na svijetu tome
Slavne naše krune sjaj.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt; 
God save, God protect
Our King and our Homeland.
With Eternal glory You adorn them,
With your force You strengthen them,
Joyful days You multiply,
And to the House of Habsburg grant them,
With its power may for ever bound
The splendor of the Croatian Crown.

You created us in our hearts 
Live pride, meek temper,
That we are kind to all people,
In honesty, first everywhere. 
You strengthen us with your faith, 
Steer the ship of our happiness, 
To take us in the right direction 
All our harmonious kindred.

But when evil threatens the home, 
&quot;To battle!&quot; the King&#x27;s voice calls,
Then on this call the saint 
Let each of us be a lion, 
To die before our flag 
Every enemy, God forbid! 
A new son is upon us 
Good peace bright shine! 

God lives, good luck to you 
Our royal splendid home, 
May our love follow him 
To the end of the border I will live that; 
Bless, life to your King 
Each of us is happy to give, 
Eternal life in that world 
Our glorious crowns shine.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;pl&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Hymn Ludowy
Boże wspieraj, Boże ochroń
Nam Cesarza i nasz kraj,
Tarczą wiary rządy osłoń,
Państwu Jego siłę daj.
Brońmy wiernie Jego tronu,
Zwróćmy wszelki wroga cios,
Bo z Habsburgów tronem złączon
Jest na wieki Austrii los.

Obowiązkom swoim wierni
Strzeżmy pilnie świętych praw
W ich obronie niech się spełni
powołanie do cnych spraw!
Pomni, jak to skroń żołnierza
Świetnie zdobi lauru krzew
Nieśmy chętnie za Monarchę,
Za Ojczyznę mienie, krew!

Ludu pilnej pracy zbiory
Niech osłania zbrojna moc
Niechaj kwitną ducha twory
Niech rozświetla światło noc!
Austrii Boże daj wsławienie
Na szczyt chwały racz ją wznieść
Słońca swego skłoń promienie
Ku jej chwale, na jej cześć!

Spólność, jedność powołania,
Niech przenika wszystkek lud,
Bo złączonych sił działania
Zdolne przemóc wszelki trud.
Dążąc społem ku celowi,
Chciejmy bratnio siły zlać,
Szczęść Monarsze, szczęść Krajowi,
Austria będzie wiecznie trwać!

Przy Cesarzu mile włada
Cesarzowa pełna łask,
Cały lud Jej hołdy składa,
Podziwiając cnót Jej blask.
Franciszkowi Józefowi
I Elżbiecie, Boże szczęść,
Habsburskiemu szczęść Domowi;

For ages the fate of Austria.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;sl&quot;&gt;Cesarska pesem
Bog ohrani, Bog obvari
Nam cesarja, Avstrijo!
Modro da nam gospodari
S svete vere pomočjo.
Branimo mu krono dedno
Zoper vse sovražnike;
S habsburškim bo tronom vedno
Sreča trdna Avstrije.

Za dolžnost in za pravico
Vsak pošteno, zvesto stoj;
Če bo treba, pa desnico
S srčnim upom dvigni v boj!
Naša vojska iz viharja
Prišla še brez slave ni:
Vse za dom in za cesarja,
Za cesarja blago, kri!

Meč vojščaka naj varuje,
Kar si pridnost zadobi;
Bistri duh pa premaguje
Z umetnijo, znanostmi!
Slava naj deželi klije,
Blagor bod&#x27; pri nas doma:
Vsa, kar solnce se obsije,
Cveti mirna Avstrija!

Trdno dajmo se skleniti:
Sloga pravo moč rodi;
Vse lahko nam bo storiti,
Tako združimo moči.
Brate vode vez edina
Nas do cilja enega:
Živi cesar, domovina,
Večna bode Avstrija!

In s cesarjem zaročnica,
Ene misli in krvi,
Vlada milo cesarica,
Polna dušne žlahtnosti.
Kar se more v srečo šteti,
Večni Bog naj podeli:
Franc Jožefu, Lizabeti,
Celi hiši Habsburški!&lt;/poem&gt;

Nella fé che gli è sostegno
Regga noi con saggio amor
Difendiamo il serto avito
Che gli adorna il regio crin
Sempre d&#x27;Austria il soglio unito
Sia d&#x27;Asburgo col destin.

Pia difesa e forte insieme
Siamo al dritto ed al dover;
E corriam con lieta speme
La battaglia a sostener!
Rammentando le ferite
Che di lauri ci coprir;
Noi daremo beni e vite
Alla patria, al nostro Sir.

Dell&#x27;industria a&#x27; bei tesori
Sia tutela il buon guerrier;
Incruenti e miti allori
Abbian l&#x27;arti ed il saper!
Benedica il Cielo e renda
Glorioso il patrio suol,
E pacifico risplenda
Sovra l&#x27;Austria ognora il sol!

Siam concordi, in forze unite
Del potere il nerbo sta;
Alte imprese fian compite,
Se concordia in noi sarà.
Siam fratelli, e un sol pensiero

Duri eterno questo Impero,
Salvi Iddio l&#x27;Imperator!&lt;/poem&gt;

That adorns his royal hair.
May the united throne of Austria
Always be with the fate of Habsburg.

Let us be together a pious and strong defense
Of right and duty;
And let us with happy hope run
To sustain the battle!
Remembering the wounds
That covered us with laurels;
We will give possessions and lives
To country and lord.

To the beautiful treasures of industry
May the good warrior be guardian;
May skills and learning
Have bloodless and gentle triumphs!
May Heaven bless and make
Glorious our country&#x27;s ground,
And may the sun always shine peacefully
Over Austria!

Let us be in agreement; in united strength
Is the core of power;
Old undertakings will be completed
If there is concord among us.
Let us be brothers, and may one thought
And one heart join us;
May this Empire last eternally,
God save the Emperor!&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Eugene Franklin Mallove (June 9, 1947 – May 14, 2004) was an American scientist, science writer, editor, and publisher of &quot;Infinite Energy&quot; magazine, and founder of the nonprofit organization New Energy Foundation. He was a proponent of cold fusion, and a supporter of its research and related exploratory alternative energy topics, several of which are sometimes characterised as &quot;fringe science&quot;.

Mallove authored &quot;Fire from Ice&quot;, a book detailing the 1989 report of tabletop cold fusion from Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann at the University of Utah. Among other things, the book claims the team did produce &quot;greater-than-unity&quot; output energy in an experiment successfully replicated on several occasions, but that the results were suppressed through an organized campaign of ridicule from mainstream physicists, including those studying controlled thermonuclear fusion, trying to protect their research and funding.

Mallove was murdered in 2004 while cleaning out his former childhood home, which had been rented out. Three people have been arrested and charged in connection with the killing; two were convicted of first-degree manslaughter and murder; the third pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice.

==Biography==
Eugene Franklin Mallove was born on June 9, 1947, to Gladys (nee&#x27; Alexander) and Mitchell Mallove. He grew up in Norwich, Connecticut and graduated from the Norwich Free Academy in 1965. From an early age, he showed great interest in science and especially astronomy. While in Boston, he met Joanne Smith, who was a student at Boston University. On September 9, 1970, Gene and Joanne married. They had two children, Kimberlyn, born in 1974, and Ethan, born in 1979.

Eugene Mallove held a BS (1969) and MS degree (1970) in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from MIT and a ScD degree (1975) in environmental health sciences from Harvard University. He had worked for technology engineering firms such as Hughes Research Laboratories, the Analytic Science Corporation, and MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory, and he consulted in research and development of new energies.

In 1981, he and Gregory Matloff wrote a paper about using solar sails to reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. They calculated that the trip would take several hundred years and that the ship would have to withstand accelerations of 60 g. They wrote several papers on that and other proposed methods of space travel, such as laser propulsion, the Bussard ramjet, and exotic fuels that could give very high power.

Mallove taught science journalism at MIT and Boston University and was chief science writer at MIT&#x27;s news office, a position he left as part of a dispute with the school over cold fusion. Mallove resigned from MIT in 1991 because he said MIT was hiding cold fusion data, partly to protect funding for and reputation of traditional fusion research. 

He was a science writer and broadcaster with the Voice of America radio service and author of three science books: &quot;The Quickening Universe: Cosmic Evolution and Human Destiny&quot; (1987, St. Martin’s Press), &quot;The Starflight Handbook: A Pioneer’s Guide to Interstellar Travel&quot; (1989, John Wiley &amp; Sons, with co-author Gregory Matloff), and &quot;Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truth Behind the Cold Fusion Furor&quot; (1991, John Wiley &amp; Sons). He also published articles for numerous magazines and newspapers.

Mallove was a member of the Aurora Biophysics Research Institute (ABRI), one of the founders of the International Society of the Friends of Aetherometry, a member of its Organizing Committee, a co-inventor of the HYBORAC technology and one of the main evaluators of ABRI technologies.

His alternative energy research included studying the reproduction of Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s Orgone Motor by Dr. Paulo Correa and Alexandra Correa, as well as the evolution of heat in the Reich-Einstein experiment. He was among the scientists and engineers who claimed to have confirmed the output of excess electric energy from tuned pulsed plasmas in vacuum arc discharges.

Mallove&#x27;s combative stance against what he saw as the hypocrisy of mainstream science gave him a high-profile. Among other things, he was a frequent guest on the American radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;.

In 1992, Mallove was a consultant on the ERR (Electromagnetic Radiation Receiver) project at the Noah’s Ark Research Facility in the Philippines. He is also credited as a &quot;cold fusion technical consultant&quot;, for providing advice to the producers of the movie &quot;The Saint&quot; from 1997, with a plot revolving around cold fusion formulas.

Eugene Mallove was a notable proponent and supporter of research into cold fusion. He authored the book &quot;Fire from Ice&quot;, which details the 1989 report of table-top cold fusion from Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann at the University of Utah. The book claims the team did produce &quot;greater-than-unity&quot; output energy in an experiment that was successfully replicated on several occasions. Mallove claims that the results were suppressed through an organized campaign of ridicule from mainstream physicists.

==Death==
Eugene Mallove was killed on May 14, 2004, in Norwich, Connecticut, while cleaning a recently vacated rental property owned by his parents, the home he grew up in. The nature of Mallove&#x27;s work led to some conspiracy theories regarding the homicide, but police suspected robbery as the motive.

In 2005, two local men were arrested in connection with the killing. The case proceeded slowly and the charges against the two men were finally dismissed on November 6, 2008.

On February 11, 2009, the State of Connecticut announced a $50,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the murder. On April 2, 2010, the police made two arrests in connection with the murder and said that more arrests were expected.
On May 22, 2011, a state prosecutor said that they were charging a third person in connection with the killing. Court testimony indicated that Mallove may have been killed by an evicted tenant who was angry about belongings being disposed of during the clearout.

On April 20, 2012, the Norwich Bulletin stated that: &quot;An ongoing murder trial came to an abrupt halt Friday when Chad Schaffer, of Norwich, decided to accept an offer of 16 years in prison, pleading guilty to the lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter in the 2004 beating death of Eugene Mallove.&quot; Mallove had just evicted Schaffer&#x27;s parents, and he was cleaning the evicted house when Schaffer arrived and confronted him.

A third individual was arraigned on November 21, 2013.

Mozelle Brown was convicted of Mallove&#x27;s murder in October 2014 and on January 6, 2015, was sentenced to 58 years in prison. Schaffer&#x27;s girlfriend, Candace Foster, testified against Brown and Schaffer, and pleaded guilty to a charge of hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence.

<text>Ma Wan is an island of Hong Kong, located between Lantau Island and Tsing Yi Island, with an area of . Administratively, it is part of Tsuen Wan District.

The Lantau Link that passes through Ma Wan was constructed in the mid-1990s as part of the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s Rose Garden plan to connect the new Hong Kong International Airport to the city centre. Its development fostered plans to develop the island. Today, a large part of Ma Wan is occupied by the Park Island apartment complex. A theme park, named Ma Wan Park, was built to accompany the housing project, with its first phase opened on 1 July 2007.
==Geography==

Ma Wan has an area of . Its highest point is Tai Leng Tau () in the southeast. Two channels separate Ma Wan and other major islands.
* to the east is the Ma Wan Channel, separating it from Tsing Yi Island. The channel is crossed by the Tsing Ma Bridge.
* to the southwest is Kap Shui Mun, separating it from the Tsing Chau Tsai Peninsula of Lantau Island. The channel is crossed by the Kap Shui Mun Bridge.
* the north seafront is opposite Tsing Lung Tau and Sham Tseng on the mainland Tsuen Wan District, part of the New Territories.
* The south faces the small Tang Lung Chau island.

==Geology==
Ma Wan surface rocks are mostly volcanic rocks called Yim Tin Tsai Formation. This is a coarse ash crystal tuff containing lapilli. Some layers of fine volcanic ash are found in the far north of the island. The contained mafic minerals are biotite and amphibole. The tuff contains mostly quartz and alkali and plagioclase feldspar. Other minerals include apatite, magnetite, monazite and zircon.

The Ma Wan granite is fine grained. It contains microcline, and few feldspar phenocrysts. The main minerals are quartz, perthitic orthoclase, and plagioclase. The dark mineral is mostly biotite. Also contained is zircon, fluorite, and allanite. It is found on the south of the east coast.

Dykes formed later with a mafic dyke injected first followed by a felsic material. A feldsparphyric dyke crosses the island east–west near the ferry pier.

Several Cenozoic age quartzphyric rhyolite dykes cross the island. These are also injected with narrow dacitic dykes, and last of all very fine grained mafic basaltic dykes.

A north east trending fault crosses Ma Wan from the typhoon shelter on the west side to the Tun Wan. The island is separated from Lantau Island by a fault under the channel called the Kap Shui Mun Fault. This is angled to the North West, and has its direction controlled by the major tectonic zone it is in called the Linhua Shan Fault System that extends from the coast of Guangdong to Fujian.

Prominent joints are at 85° parallel to the dykes. Other joints are close to horizontal, can cause rocks to form sheets.

==History==
Remains have been found from the Mid-Neolithic Age (about 3000 BC), the late Neolithic Age (about 2000 BC), the early to late Bronze Age of coastal South China (1500–500 BC), the period of the Warring States to the Han dynasty (206 BC −220 AD), the Tang dynasty (618–917 AD) and the Qing dynasty (1644–1911 AD).

In 1997, a joint excavation by the Antiquities and Monuments Office and the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences found complete Neolithic human skeletal remains in tombs at the Tung Wan Tsai North site. 20 tombs were found spanning from the late Neolithic to the early Bronze Age.

The prehistoric island had late neolithic inhabitants as proved by recent excavations. There were also inhabitants here during the Han dynasty.

Foreign visitors first arrived on the island in 1794.

Ma Wan once had a Customs house, still recorded by a stone monument named &quot;Kowloon Gate&quot; monument. (near the old Rural Committee building). It ceased activity on 4 October 1899. Similar customs stations had been established at Fat Tau Chau and Cheung Chau.

In 1965 as part of the United States CARE program, 12 two storey housing units, and one communal house were donated and built on a top of a hill near the Fishermen&#x27;s Association. The new village costed around HK$ 200,000 to build, and could house 24 families. After naming it Ma Wan Fishermen&#x27;s Village (), it was officially opened on the 7th of December 1965 by Arthur Patrick Richardson (李作新), the Assistant Director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

In the early 1970s, the island across from Ma Wan was occupied by three families. Their family names were Woo, Pang, and Woo. The children of these families attended the kindergarten and Fong Yuen School in Ma Wan. Water transportation to Ma Wan was signalled by waving a flag at the pier. 

As of 1995, fish farming was the predominant economic activity on Ma Wan.

Ma Wan had a population of 800 in 2000. With the development of the Park Island apartment complex, villagers were rehoused in the northern part of the island. As part of the compensation package, they could choose either a 3-storey traditional village house of or 3 separate units, each of in one single block.

==Features==


===Park Island===
Park Island is a private housing estate that was mainly developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties as part of the Ma Wan Development joint venture project and completed from 2002 to 2006 in six phases.

==Transport==

===Road===
Although the Hong Kong government originally claimed it would be &quot;physically impossible&quot; to give the island a road connection via the Lantau Link, this was disproved with the beginning of construction of Park Island. The island is now connected to Tsing Yi by the Tsing Ma Bridge (a suspension bridge), and to Lantau Island by the Kap Shui Mun Bridge (a cable-stayed bridge). Both bridges are part of the Lantau Link.

Park Island Transport Co., Ltd. operates bus services from Park Island to Tsing Yi MTR station, Kwai Fong Metroplaza, Hong Kong International Airport, Tsuen Wan West and Tsuen Wan (close to the Tsuen Wan MTR station).

Starting from 3 July 2008, urban taxis were permitted access into Ma Wan between 8 pm and 7 am the following morning to meet residents&#x27; transport needs. Starting from 14 December 2012, urban taxi were permitted access into Ma Wan 24 hours daily.

Private vehicles are generally not permitted to enter the island, an arrangement which also exists in Discovery Bay on the nearby Lantau Island; however a permit can be requested from the Transport Department of Hong Kong. Minibuses are not allowed, but the Park Island management company operates cars in case of emergency or special situations, though their availability is not guaranteed. Lorries may enter the island between 10 am to 4 pm daily without the need for a special permit.

===Water===
There are several ferry piers on the island: Park Island Ferry Pier on the northeast, one on the old Tin Liu village on the west (formerly hosting Sham Tseng ferries), Man Wan Public Pier on the southwest at Ma Wan Main Street Village, Tai Pai Tsui Pier on the south of the island facing Tang Lung Chau, one on the north of the island used for the garbage removal, one on the southeast side (but on a Government land not open).

Park Island Transport Co., Ltd. operates ferry services between Park Island and Central Piers (Pier 2). Another route to Tsuen Wan Pier (near West Rail Tsuen Wan West station) is also available.

==Education==
Ma Wan is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 62, which includes schools in Tsuen Wan and areas nearby. The net includes multiple aided schools and one government school, Hoi Pa Street Government Primary School.

<text>Droylsden is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, east of Manchester city centre and west of Ashton-under-Lyne, with a population at the 2011 Census of 22,689.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, in the mid-19th century Droylsden grew as a mill town on the Ashton canal. Beginning in the early 1930s, Droylsden&#x27;s population expanded rapidly as it became a housing overflow area for neighbouring Manchester.

Since 1785, the Fairfield area of Droylsden has been home to a Moravian Church.

==History==

Droylsden was settled around AD 900.
Before Droylsden became a part of Greater Manchester, it was popularly referred to by Mancunians as &quot;The Silly Country&quot;. One suggestion as to the source of that nickname is that once a year, some of the townsfolk used to watch an annual carnival by bringing a pig and sitting it on a wall to watch the passing entertainment with them. The Pig on the Wall public house, converted from a farm in 1978, takes its name from that story.

The first machine woven towel in the world – the terry towel – was produced by W. M. Christy and Sons of Fairfield Mills, in Droylsden, in 1851. William Miller Christy&#x27;s son, Henry Christy, had brought back a looped towel from Turkey in the 1840s, which Christy&#x27;s managed to copy on an adapted loom. Their Royal Turkish towels became famous, with Queen Victoria having a regular order. The mill closed at the end of the 1980s, and in 1997 Tesco opened a supermarket on the site.

Construction of a marina began in 2007, and was completed in 2012. The marina has 92 three and four-bedroom houses, and 291 one and two-bedroom apartments as well as waterside offices, restaurants, and shops.

==Geography==
Droylsden is located at (53.4826, −2.1582), about to the east of Manchester city centre, close to Ashton-under-Lyne, Failsworth, Clayton, Openshaw and Newton Heath.


==Transport==
===Rail===

Droylsden is not directly served by railway with the nearest station being Fairfield railway station approximately 1 mile south of the town centre, providing a service to Manchester Piccadilly and Rose Hill Marple. The town&#x27;s former railway station was open between 1846 and 1968 and located on Lumb Lane, approximately 1 mile north of the town centre on the Huddersfield Line. The nearest station on this line is Ashton-under-Lyne.

===Metrolink===

From 2013, Droylsden became a terminus on the East Manchester line of the Manchester Metrolink tram network, with services running to Manchester and Bury. Trams now run from Droylsden to Ashton-under-Lyne via Audenshaw and Ashton Moss.

===Bus===
The town has frequent bus services, the majority operated by Stagecoach Manchester. Buses 7, 7A and 7B run between Ashton-under-Lyne and Stockport. Bus 216 runs a main-road service between Manchester city centre and Ashton-under-Lyne, sometimes extending to Stalybridge in the evening. Bus 217 runs between Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Piccadilly, taking a more indirect route. Buses 230 and 231 run between Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester city centre.

==Education==
In January 2009, the closure of Droylsden School Mathematics and Computing College for Girls and Littlemoss High School for Boys was approved by Tameside Council. This was conditional on the Secretary of State signing an Academy Funding Agreement by 30 April 2009 for the two schools to be replaced by Droylsden Academy. Droylsden Academy, which was sponsored by Tameside College, opened in September 2009, in the existing buildings of the two former schools. The new Droylsden Academy building opened on the school site of Droylsden School Mathematics and Computing College for Girls in January 2012.

Fairfield High School for Girls was unaffected by these changes and has been granted Specialist Science College status.

Tameside College also operates a Local Learning Centre for adult learners in Droylsden.

==Governance==

Droylsden was anciently a chapelry in the parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. It became an urban district of the administrative county of Lancashire under the Local Government Act 1894, and was granted its arms on 16 October 1950. In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, Droylsden became a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

Droylsden was once a large township, including Big Droylsden, Little Droylsden, and Clayton. In 1889 Little Droylsden was subsumed into Openshaw, and in 1890 Clayton was ceded from Droylsden&#x27;s control to become part of Manchester.

From 1918 until 1950, Droylsden was represented by the parliamentary constituency of Mossley. Manchester&#x27;s expansion to the east and the increase in the electorate, resulted in the seat being divided in the 1950 boundary change. The areas adjacent to Manchester, including Droylsden, formed the new Droylsden constituency, with the remainder forming part of Ashton-under-Lyne. The Droylsden constituency was abolished in 1955, when Droylsden itself became part of the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency.

David Heyes MP represented the constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne from 2001 to 2015. He was replaced by his fellow Labour Party member Angela Rayner in the 2015 UK General Election.

==Culture==

The Droylsden Little Theatre has been running amateur productions since 1931.

Horror film production company Fade To Blood Films is based in Droylsden

==Population change==
==Economy==

During the 1930s, Droylsden&#x27;s population expanded rapidly, as it became a housing overflow area for Manchester. Today the area is predominately occupied by employed home owners.

Robertson&#x27;s Jam was a significant employer in the area. The factory was established in 1891, on the banks of the Ashton Canal, on Ashton Hill Lane. At its peak it employed around 1,000 workers; that number was reduced to around 400 before closing during 2008. The factory was demolished during the early part of 2010.

==Sport==
Droylsden is home to Droylsden F.C. who won the Conference North league in 2006–07, gaining promotion to the Conference National for the 2007–08 season, although they were relegated back to Conference North for 2008–09, and into the Northern Premier League Premier Division in 2012–13. Now Droylsden play in the Northern Premier League Division One North.

Droylsden is one of a number of locations which are promoted as the birthplace of speedway racing in the UK. Britain&#x27;s first ever Speedway meeting was staged in Droylsden on 25 June 1927, billed as dirt track racing.

==Notable people==
England&#x27;s rugby union captain from 1956 to 1958, Eric Evans, was born in Droylsden in 1921.

Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was born in the town in 1890.

Rev Arthur Herbert Procter, Victoria Cross recipient, was Rector of St Mary&#x27;s parish church from 1946 to 1951. A Blue Plaque is at the church.

Scott Bruton, &quot;X Factor&quot; finalist in 2008, was raised in the town. Other notable people who grew up in the town include 10cc&#x27;s Eric Stewart, Howard Donald of Take That, cult author Jeff Noon, professional boxer Prince Arron, and the musician known as &quot;Damian&quot;.

Cyril Lord (1911–1984), &#x27;the Carpet King&#x27;, was born and raised in Droylsden. He later established a huge carpet factory in Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland.

Criminal Dale Cregan was a resident of Droylsden, in which one of the more news notable incidents was performed near Droylsden Town Hall prior to his arrest following the murder of two police women in Hattersley

Eric Stewart, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer, was born in Droylsden.

<doc id="544351" wikidata="Q7647102" url="?curid=544351" title="Survey township">
<text>A survey township, sometimes called a Congressional township or just township, as used by the United States Public Land Survey System and by Canada&#x27;s Dominion Land Survey is a nominally-square area of land that is nominally six survey miles (about 9.66 km) on a side. Each 36-square-mile (about 93.2 km2) township is divided into 36 sections of one square mile (640 acres, roughly 2.6 km2) each. The sections can be further subdivided for sale.

The townships are referenced by a numbering system that locates the township in relation to a principal meridian (north-south) and a base line (east-west). For example, Township 2 North, Range 4 East is the 4th township east of the principal meridian and the 2nd township north of the base line.

== History in the US ==
Township (exterior) lines were originally surveyed and platted by the United States General Land Office using contracted private survey crews. Later survey crews subdivided the townships into section (interior) lines. Virtually all lands covered by this system were sold according to those boundaries and are marked on the U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps.

Prior to standardization, some of the Ohio Lands (the United States Military District, the Firelands and the Connecticut Western Reserve) were surveyed into townships of on each side. These are often known as Congressional Townships.

Sections are divided into quarter-sections of each and quarter-quarter sections of each. In the Homestead Act of 1862, one quarter-section of land was the amount allocated to each settler. Stemming from that are the idiomatic expressions, &quot;the lower 40&quot;, the 40 acres on a settler&#x27;s land that is lowest in elevation, in the direction towards which water drains toward a stream, and the &quot;back forty&quot;, the portion farthest from the settler&#x27;s dwelling.

== History in Canada ==
In western Canada, the Dominion Land Survey adopted a similar format for survey townships, which do not form administrative units. These townships also have an area of approximately 36 square miles (six miles by six miles).

These townships include road allowances, so their nominal dimensions are a bit longer than six miles. In the first and second phases of the survey (Manitoba and parts of Saskatchewan), townships are nominally east-west and north-south. In the third phase of the survey (British Columbia, Alberta and most of Saskatchewan), townships are nominally east-west and north-south. The actual area of a given township differs from the nominal because of systematic effects (due to the design of the survey) and surveying errors.

== Survey township vs. civil township ==
Survey townships are distinct from civil townships. A survey township is used to establish boundaries for land ownership, while a civil township is a form of local government. In states with civil townships, the two types of townships often coincide. County lines, especially in western states, usually follow survey township lines, leading to the large number of rectangular counties in the Midwest, which are agglomerations of survey townships.

<text>Diss is a market town, civil parish and electoral ward in South Norfolk, England; it is near to the boundary with Suffolk. It had population of 7,572 in 2011. It lies in the valley of the River Waveney, round a mere covering and up to deep, although there is another of mud.

==Toponymy==

The town&#x27;s name originates from , an Anglo-Saxon word meaning . 

==History==
Diss has several historic buildings, including an early 14th-century parish church and an 1850s Corn Hall, which is still in use. Under Edward the Confessor, Diss was part of the Hartismere hundred of Suffolk, It was recorded as such in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is recorded as being in the king&#x27;s possession as demesne (direct ownership) of the Crown, there being at that time a church and a glebe of 24 acres (9.7 ha).

This was thought to be worth £15 per annum, which had doubled by the time of William the Conqueror to £30, with the benefit of the whole hundred and half belonging to it. It was then found to be a league long, around and half that distance wide, and paid 4d. in Danegeld. From this it appears that it was still relatively small, but it soon grew, when it subsumed Watlingsete Manor, a neighbouring area as large as Diss, and seemingly more populated according to the geld or tax that it paid. The town includes part of Heywode, as appears from its joining to Burston, into which the manor extended.

Diss was granted by King Henry I to Richard de Lucy, some time before 1135. The &quot;Testa de Neville&quot; finds it not known whether Diss was rendered to Richard de Lucy as an inheritance or for his service, but adds it was doubtless for the latter. Richard de Lucy become Chief Justiciar to King Stephen and Henry II. 

In 1152, Richard de Lucy received the right to hold a market in Diss, and before 1161 he gave a third of a hundred of Diss (Heywood or Hewode) together with the market in frank marriage with his daughter Dionisia to Sir Robert de Mountenay. After Richard de Lucy&#x27;s death in 1179, the inheritance of the other two parts of Diss hundred passed to his daughter Maud, who married Walter FitzRobert.

The whole estate later fell to the Lordship of the FitzWalters, who were raised to Baron FitzWalter in 1295. In 1299, the then Lord FitzWalter obtained a charter of confirmation for a fair every year at his manor of Diss, to be held around the feast day of Saint Simon and Jude (28 October) and several days after. A grant made in 1298 to William Partekyn of Prilleston (now Billingford) presented for homage and half a mark of silver two homesteads in Diss, with liberty of washing his wool and cloths in Diss Meer. This came on the express condition that the gross dye be washed off first. It seems that Diss church was built by the same Lord, as his arms appear in the stone of the south porch of the church several times.

Soon after the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, Edward Plantagenet, Duke of York and Earl of Rutland, came to hold Diss manor, hundred and market, together with Hemenhale, and the title of Lord FitzWalter became attached to the estate. It was part of a larger estate that included Hemenhale and Diss manors, with the hundred of Diss in Norfolk, the manors of Shimpling and Thorne in Suffolk, of Wodeham-Walter (now Woodham Walter), Henham, Leiden (now part of Leaden Roding), Vitring, Dunmow Parva (now Little Dunmow), Burnham (possibly the modern village of Burnham-on-Crouch), Winbush, and Shering (now Sheering) in Essex. Shortly afterwards, the estate was acquired by the Ratcliffe family, which inherited the title of Baron FitzWalter. The family owned the land until at least 1732, styling themselves Viscounts FitzWalter.

John Skelton, tutor and court poet to Henry VIII, was appointed rector at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Diss in about 1503. He retained the benefice until his death. Events there formed the subject of some of his poems, such as the humorous invective &quot;Ware the Hauke&quot;, in which another priest goes falconing in St Mary&#x27;s, barring the doors against him and causing chaos in the church.

Opposite the 14th-century parish Church of St Mary the Virgin stands a 16th-century building known as the Dolphin House. This was one of the town&#x27;s major buildings, as its impressive dressed-oak beams denote. It may have been a wool merchant&#x27;s house. Formerly a pub, the &quot;Dolphin&quot;, from the 1800s to the 1960s, the building now houses some small businesses.

Next to Dolphin House is the town&#x27;s market place, the town&#x27;s geographical and social centre. The market is held every Friday (except Good Friday and other holidays, when it is rescheduled to Thursday): a variety of local traders sell fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, fish and cheeses. It was first granted a charter by Richard the Lionheart. The town&#x27;s post office and main shopping street, Mere Street, are also near the marketplace, and Diss Town Hall is located nearby on Market Hill.

Early in 1871, alterations at a house in Mount Street about north of the parish church led workmen to remove the brick flooring of a ground-floor room and insert the joists of a boarded floor. They found in the centre, some from the surface, a hoard of over 300 coins, all silver but for two gold nobles.

From 1927 until 1982, Cambridge businessman Jack Baldry and his son Derek operated a factory in the town that produced soda water, lemonade and cola for the pubs of East Anglia. Baldry also owned soft drinks factories in Cambridge and Sawston The old brewery in Diss that Jack converted into a soda factory is still known locally as Baldry&#x27;s Yard.

The 100th Bomb Group Memorial Museum is located east of Diss at the former RAF Thorpe Abbotts airfield.

In March 2006, Diss became the third UK town to join Cittaslow, an international body promoting a concept of &quot;Slow Towns&quot;. However, it has since withdrawn.

A railway journey from London to Diss forms the subject of a poem by Sir John Betjeman: &quot;A Mind&#x27;s Journey to Diss&quot;. He also made a short documentary film in 1964, entitled &quot;Something about Diss&quot;.

==Climate==
==Religion==
Diss has at least nine places of worship. They include the 13th-century Anglican parish church, the Catholic (St Henry Morse), with Methodist, Baptist and community churches.

The civil parish is formed by the town of Driffield and the village of Little Driffield. By road, it is north-east of Leeds, east of York and north of Hull.

Driffield, being near the centre of the Yorkshire Wolds, is named &quot;The Capital of the Wolds&quot;.

According to the 2011 UK census, Driffield parish had a population of 13,080, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 11,477.

The town was listed in the 2019 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; report on the Best Places to Live in northern England.

==History==

Driffield is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and the name is first attested in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; where King Aldfrith of Northumbria died on 14 December 705. It is also found in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, meaning &quot;dirty (manured) field&quot;.

A Bronze Age mound outside Driffield was excavated in the 19th century, the contents of which are now kept in the British Museum. It includes a knife, a dagger, a beaker and a greenstone wrist-guard all dating to between 2200 and 1500 BC.

The remains of Driffield Castle, a motte-and-bailey castle, sit at Moot Hill.

RAF Driffield was targeted by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. On 15 August 1940, a raid by Junkers Ju 88s resulted in 14 deaths and many injuries. RAF Driffield was the site of the first death in the WAAF during the Second World War.

==Governance==
The town is a major part of the Driffield and Rural electoral ward. This ward stretches north-west to Sledmere with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 15,199. It is part of the Bridlington and the Wolds constituency for elections to Westminster. Driffield Town Hall is no longer used for public events and was acquired by The Bell Hotel in 1986.

==Culture and amenities== 
Driffield is centred around &quot;Middle Street&quot;, its main high street of both independent and chain shops and retail. On a Thursday, a market is held in the town centre. Its original cattle market closed in 2001.

The town is home to Driffield Show, the United Kingdom’s largest one-day annual agricultural show, as well as the Driffield Steam and Vintage Rally – an event held each August showcasing historical vehicles including traction engines, fairground organs, tractors and vintage cars and trucks. A particular focus is placed upon agricultural history, with demonstrations of ploughing and threshing often taking place. The rally is particularly known for the Saturday evening road-run of the steam engines and other vehicles into Driffield town centre, an event which invariably attracts large crowds of spectators.

Driffield also has a small community hospital (known as Alfred Bean Hospital), a fire station, a local police station, and several churches.

Driffield lies in the Yorkshire Wolds, on the Driffield Navigation canal, and near the source of the River Hull. This is maintained by the Driffield Navigation Trust and the group hosts an annual raft race and open day gala at the &quot;River Head&quot;.

The Driffield Beck runs roughly parallel to the main high street. Some stretches of Driffield Beck are popular for fishing, particularly for brown trout and grayling.

<doc id="544369" wikidata="Q1173598" url="?curid=544369" title="David Astor">
<text>Francis David Langhorne Astor (5 March 1912 – 7 December 2001) was an English newspaper publisher, editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; at the height of its circulation and influence, and member of the Astor family, &quot;the landlords of New York&quot;.

==Early life==

David Astor was born in London, England, the third child of American-born English parents, Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor (1879–1952), and Nancy Witcher Langhorne (1879–1964). The product of an immensely wealthy business dynasty, and raised in the grandeur of a great country estate where the political and intellectual elite gathered, he nevertheless showed compassion for the poor and those who were victims of destructive socioeconomic policies.

An extremely shy man, David Astor was greatly influenced by his father, but as a young man he rebelled against his strong-willed mother. After an education at West Downs School in Winchester, Hampshire, followed by Eton College in Berkshire, he attended Balliol College, Oxford, where he suffered a nervous breakdown and left in 1933 without graduating. He was psycho-analysed by Anna Freud, and during World War II, he served with distinction as a Royal Marines officer and was wounded in France. While at Balliol in 1931, he met a young anti-fascist German, named Adam von Trott zu Solz, who was to become the most influential figure in his life. Von Trott&#x27;s involvement in the 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler led to his execution.

==Career==
In 1936, Astor joined the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; newspaper, where he worked for a year before joining his father&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Observer&quot;, which he would edit for 27 years. With his father&#x27;s advancing age, and high inheritance taxes in England, in 1945 David Astor and his brother transferred ownership of the paper to a board of trustees. The trust contained restrictions so that the paper could not be subject to a hostile takeover but also stipulated that its profits go towards improving the newspaper, promoting high journalistic standards, and required a portion of the profits to be donated to charitable causes.

In 1945, Astor purchased the Manor House at Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire, living there and restoring The Abbey in the village, which he bought in 1958 and was across the road from the Manor House. He leased The Abbey to the Ockenden Venture, which used it as a home for refugee children.

===&quot;Observer&quot; editor===
Astor became the editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1948 and by the mid-1950s, he had made &quot;The Observer&quot; a successful and influential paper that published points of view from the right and left. Astor&#x27;s policies were passionate about the plight of black Africans and the violation of human rights. He wrote against the death penalty and opposed all censorship. But, he took a more conservative view on the economic problems caused by high taxes and believed British trades unions had become too powerful and were hindering economic progress. He warned of the dangers of big government and of big business, influenced by his friend and employee of &quot;The Observer&quot;, George Orwell.

Astor broadly supported the Cold War containment policies of Atlantic alliance and consequently had difficulties with &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s foreign editor, the German emigre Sebastian Haffner. Haffner was unwilling to dismiss the March 1952 Stalin Note with its offer of Soviet withdrawal in return for German neutrality. In 1954 he accepted a financially generous offer to transfer to Berlin as &quot;The Observer&#x27;s&quot; German correspondent but again broke with Astor in 1961 when &quot;The Observer&quot; refused to call for a more forceful allied response to the building of the Berlin Wall.

With Haffner, in the late 1940s Astor was one of the so-called Shanghai Club (named after a restaurant in Soho) of liberal/left-leaning and emigre journalists that included Orwell, Isaac Deutscher (who as a roving European correspondent also wrote for the &quot;Observer&quot;), E. H. Carr, Barbara Ward, and Jon Kimche.

In 1956, David Astor and his newspaper came under fire when it accused Prime Minister Anthony Eden of lying to the people about important matters in Suez Crisis. Although he ultimately was shown to have been right, the situation harmed the paper&#x27;s image and its circulation and advertising revenue began to decline. Astor&#x27;s causes included playing a main role in establishing Amnesty International in 1961 after his paper published &quot;The Forgotten Prisoners&quot; by Peter Benenson. He also voiced strong opposition to the apartheid policy of the white South African government and supported the African National Congress (ANC). Nelson Mandela would refer to Astor as one of the best and most loyal of friends who had supported the ANC when other newspapers ignored them.

Despite his great wealth, David Astor lived modestly, putting his money to good use through a network of benefactions and charities. Although he proved a brilliant editor, he lacked the drive for profits like other newcomers to the business who took advantage to increase rapidly both their advertising and circulation at the expense of &quot;The Observer&quot;. When &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; launched a Sunday edition in 1961 it changed what had been a staid industry and the ensuing battles for advertising changed the character of how and what newspapers were all about. The aggressive marketing by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; under Canadian newspaper tycoon Roy Thomson hurt circulation while the paper&#x27;s unions were making repeated demands that drove costs to a point where the operation became an unsustainable business.

In April 1962, Astor gave a speech about the roots of political extremism, which led to the formation of the Columbus Centre, led by Professor Norman Cohn, and which became a research centre at the University of Sussex.

==Later life==
In 1975, Astor resigned as editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; but continued as a trustee. In 1977 the paper was sold by his family to Robert O. Anderson, the American owner of the Atlantic Richfield Oil Company. In his retirement Astor continued to support a number of charities and to finance pressure groups for causes that he strongly believed in. He was appointed as a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1994 New Year Honours &quot;for public and charitable services&quot;. In 1995 David Astor was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from Plymouth University.

===Campaign for Myra Hindley===
During the 1980s and 1990s, he campaigned alongside Lord Longford to try and gain parole for the Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, claiming that she was a reformed character and no threat to society, and had therefore qualified for parole from the life sentence imposed on her in 1966 for her role with Ian Brady in the murder of three children. He continued his campaign even after Hindley admitted taking part in two more murders in 1986. In September 1990, he even claimed that her continued imprisonment was comparable to that of Nelson Mandela, who had just been released from prison in South Africa after serving 27 years of a life sentence for his part in the battle against the oppression of black people under that country&#x27;s apartheid regime. Astor had also been a supporter of the campaign for Mandela&#x27;s release from prison. Along with Longford, he claimed that she was being kept in prison to serve the interests of successive Home Secretaries and their governments (who had the power to decide on minimum terms for life sentence prisoners from 1983 until 2002); these politicians gradually increased Hindley&#x27;s original minimum of 25 to 30 years and from 1990 to a whole life tariff. The campaign to win parole for Myra Hindley was unsuccessful, with her appeal against the whole life tariff being rejected three times by the High Court, and she remained in prison until her death in November 2002, almost a year after Astor&#x27;s own death. Longford had died earlier in 2001.

Astor had been a supporter of Mandela and an opponent of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime since shortly after Mandela was jailed in 1964. He continued to support the campaign for Mandela&#x27;s release until he was finally set free from prison in February 1990 and continued to oppose the apartheid regime until it was finally completely abolished four years later, just before Mandela became the president of South Africa.

Astor was one of the founders of the Koestler Trust in the 1960s and continued to support the scheme until his death. The Koestler Trust was set up as a charity to promote creative arts in prisons; Astor was the Trust&#x27;s chair for a period.

==Personal life==
In 1945, he married for the first time to Melanie Hauser, with whom he had one child:
* Frances Christine Langhorne Astor (b. 1947)

After his divorce from Melanie in 1951, he married Bridget Aphra Wreford (1928-2019) in 1952. David and Bridget had five children:
* Alice Margaret Frances Astor (b. 1953)
* Richard David Langhorne Astor (b. 1955)
* Lucy Aphra Nancy Astor (b. 1958)
* Nancy Bridget Elizabeth Astor (b. 1960)
* Thomas Robert Langhorne Astor (b. 1962)
David Astor died in December 2001 at the age of 89, and is buried in All Saints&#x27; parish churchyard, Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire, in a grave with a simple headstone bearing only his name and years of birth and death. In an adjacent grave is his friend Eric Arthur Blair, better known by his pen name George Orwell. Astor bought both burial plots when he learned that Orwell had asked to be buried in an English country churchyard.

<text>Ma Wan Tung Wan Beach is a gazetted beach near Noah&#x27;s Ark on Ma Wan island, Hong Kong. The beach is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. The beach is 140 metres long and is rated as Grade 4 by the Environmental Protection Department for its water quality. It is the only gazetted beach in Ma Wan and offers views of Ting Kau Bridge as well as Tsing Ma Bridge.

==History==
In 1991, the beach was gazetted by the Hong Kong Government and was officially opened in May 1993. However, in 1995, the beaches in Tsuen Wan District were closed due to the construction of the nearby Ting Kau and Tsing Ma Bridges and no longer allowed the public to swim due to its poor water quality. In 2001, when the water quality of Tung Wan in Ma Wan had gradually improved, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department had decided to reopen the beach. It was the only beach in Tsuen Wan that was officially approved for swimming from 2001 to 2011.

Since Park Island, a housing estate near Tung Wan in Ma Wan, was completed in 2002, the use of beaches had increased significantly, and it had become a good place for residents of this housing estate in summer.

==Usage==
The beach is a flat stretch of fine golden sand with superb views of Tsing Ma and Ting Kau Bridges as well as passing ships.

==Features==
The beach has the following features:
* Changing rooms
* Showers
* Toilets

<doc id="544374" wikidata="Q1253266" url="?curid=544374" title="Downham Market">
<text>Downham Market, sometimes simply referred to as Downham, is a market town and civil parish in Norfolk, England. It lies on the edge of the Fens, on the River Great Ouse, approximately 11 miles south of King&#x27;s Lynn, 39 miles west of Norwich and 30 miles north of Cambridge.

The civil parish has an area of 5.2 km² and in the 2011 census had a population of 9,994 in 4,637 households.

It was an agricultural centre, developing as a market for the produce of the Fens with a bridge across the Ouse. During the Middle Ages, it was famed for its butter market and also hosted a notable horse fair. The market is now held Fridays and Saturdays.

Notable buildings in the town include its medieval parish church, dedicated to St Edmund, and the Victorian clock tower, constructed in 1878. The town is also known as the place where Charles I hid after the Battle of Naseby. In 2004 the town completed a regeneration project on the Market Place, moving the market to the town hall car park. The decorative town sign depicts the crown and arrows of St Edmund with horses to show the importance of the horse fairs in the town&#x27;s history.

A heritage centre, Discover Downham, opened in a former fire station in 2016. The town is twinned with Civray, Vienne, France.

== Toponymy ==
The towns name means &quot;Hill homestead/village&quot; with a market. The town is situated on a terrace overlooking the Great Ouse.

==Governance==
For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk. The Norfolk County Council electoral division of Downham Market covers a lesser area than that of the parish; the population of this division taken at the 2011 Census was 7,988. In February 2022, eight town councillors, including the mayor Jenny Groom, resigned over claims of bullying. The town is part of South West Norfolk parliamentary constituency.

== Economy ==
Historically, Downham Market was an important market centre for the surrounding agricultural area. It incorporated a famous horse fair and weekly livestock and butter markets. There were several maltings in the town supplying the brewing trade in the town at a time when beer was often safer to drink than well water.

Before the arrival of the railway in 1846, the riverside was largely agricultural with warehousing for river transport centred on the Great Ouse at Downham West. With the coming of the railway, there was a rapid industrial and residential development into Downham Market.

Jacob Mason Bird built his steam mill by the railway. The mill, now run by Heygates, is still known as Bird’s Mill. Other industries grew as the railway became the focus for warehousing, the loading of cattle and products, and the building of railway housing.

Today, Downham Market has seen rapid residential development and has become commuter town for Cambridge. The town has a market on Fridays and Saturdays.

== Landmarks ==

=== Town clock ===
The Town Clock, erected by William Cunliffe in 1878, is a Grade II listed structure. Made of cast iron, the clock was originally bronzed and relieved on the prominent parts with gold. Later the clock was painted bottle green, and its current black-and-white finish was applied during the 2004 restoration.

=== War memorial ===
The town&#x27;s war memorial stands at the junction of London Road and Church Road. It was dedicated in October 1921 to the dead of World War I. It was paid for by public subscription and built by H. J. Long, a local stonemason. The memorial originally commemorated 73 local servicemen who fell in the First World War with the names of the dead of World War II added later. In 2005, Evelyn Irene Murrell, who died in 1918, a member of the WRAF was belatedly added to the list of names. The memorial bears the crown-and-arrows symbol of the town and of the martyred King St Edmund of East Anglia to whom the church is dedicated.

=== Notable buildings ===
Downham Market is sometimes known as the &quot;Gingerbread Town&quot; because of the characteristic local carrstone used for buildings since medieval times. 

St Edmund&#x27;s Church is a good example of this and is Downham&#x27;s only Grade I listed building. It stands in a prominent position overlooking the flat Fenlands to the west. The church, like the town, was probably an Anglo-Saxon foundation but rebuilt in the 13th century (Early English period) and extensively altered in the 15th and 16th centuries (Perpendicular and Tudor periods).

The Old Court House, located on London Road, was where the magistrates dispensed justice in the Clackclose Hundred from 1861.

The Castle Hotel is Grade II listed and features a distinctive battlemented parapet. It is a mainly 18th-century building, but the core is probably earlier. In the past, visitors stayed here for hunting, shooting and fishing in the local area. The hotel had its own transport to and from railway station, and out on shooting parties. The building closed as a hotel and restaurant in 2020 and is set to be redeveloped into flats.

Downham Market Town Hall, on the west side of the old Market Hill, was built by public subscription in 1887/8.

Opposite the Town Hall is a coaching inn, the Crown Hotel. Just inside the arched entrance are steps leading to a mounting block for horsemen. Before the Court House was built, magistrates met here. In May 1816 it was the scene of riots when the magistrates were besieged by angry, starving agricultural labourers demanding a living wage of two shillings a day and the release of poachers. Two of the Downham rioters, Daniel Harwood and Thomas Thody, were hanged on 31 August 1816.

The 18th century Dial House, located on Station Road, was once a private school for gentlemen in the 1860s. Its name is derived from the sundial painted high on the wall. Today the building is a bed and breakfast.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
The town is served by Downham Market railway station, which is on the Fen Line between London and King&#x27;s Lynn. It opened in 1846. The station has hourly services to London Kings Cross and operated by Great Northern.

The town signal box is one of five rare examples across the region to have been granted Grade II listed status in 2013. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport listed 26 signal boxes across the country as part of a joint project between Network Rail and English Heritage to secure the nation&#x27;s railway signalling heritage. Downham&#x27;s signal box was built in 1881 for the Great Eastern Railway.

In 2017, the station was renovated to commemorate former British Rail division Network SouthEast.

=== Bus ===
The town is served on Mondays - Saturdays by Lynx route 37 to Southery and King&#x27;s Lynn. and by less regular &quot;Go to town&quot; services 47, 60 and 61 to Fincham, Three Holes, Swaffham and King&#x27;s Lynn. There are no buses serving the town on Sundays.

=== Road ===
Downham Market is on the north–south A10 road from London to King&#x27;s Lynn. The east-west A1122 from Outwell to Swaffham runs south of the town.

=== River ===
The River Great Ouse and Great Ouse Relief Channel flows through the western boundary of the town. 

The Great Ouse Relief Channel was made navigable in 2001, when the Environment Agency constructed a lock at Denver to provide access. Moorings are located next to the Station Road bridge. The river is a popular spot for boating and swimming.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in Downham Market: Hillcrest Primary School and Nelson Academy.

Nelson Academy, situated on Nursery Road, was originally named Clackclose Community Primary School after Clackclose Hundred. The school opened in 1873 on Snape Lane. It was the first primary education academy sponsored by the CWA Academy Trust, founded by the College of West Anglia, in 2014. It is named after Lord Nelson who, according to local folklore, attended his first school in Downham Market.

Hillcrest Primary School is on Bexwell Road, and was opened in 1980 as Hillcrest First and Middle School. It is named after Hillcrest, the road connecting Bexwell Road and Civray Avenue. In 2018, the school began work on a new £4.5m nine classroom building.

Downham Market Academy, formerly Downham Market GM High School, is a secondary school and sixth form with academy status, The academy was launched on 1 July 2013, sponsored by the CWA Academy Trust founded by the College of West Anglia. Teaching is shared between two sites, with the main Bexwell campus housing pupils years 7–11 (ages 11–16) and the Downham Market Academy Sixth Form (formerly Downham Market College) campus offering A-levels to sixth form pupils years 12–13 (ages 16–18).

Downham Preparatory School and Montessori Nursery is a non-selective Independent Preparatory School for girls and boys aged three months to 13 years. The school was founded by its present (2021) owner, Elizabeth Laffeaty-Sharpe, in 1984 for children aged two to five years.

The Priory Centre holds the Downham Market Library.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either the Tacolneston or Sandy Heath TV transmitters. It is also possible to receive reception from the Belmont transmitter which broadcasts BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire, and the Waltham TV transmitter that broadcast BBC East Midlands and ITV Central.

<text>Downham is a district of South East London, England, primarily within the London Borough of Lewisham and some parts in the London Borough of Bromley. It is located north of Bromley and south of Catford.

Downham was named in honour of Lord Downham, who was chairman of the London County Council between 1919 and 1920.

The Prime Meridian passes just to the west of Downham.

British Film-maker Luna Carmoon was raised in the area and made her first two shorts and her debut feature Hoard in the area. She refers to them as her Downham Trilogy&#x27;.

==History==

===Origins of the Downham Estate===
Before 1920, the area had no houses, apart from a shooting range close to Rangefield Road and areas of farmland in the period around 1890. Some belonged to Holloway Farm and others to Shroffolds Farm. Following the First World War, local boroughs like Deptford and Bermondsey as well as the London County Council [LCC] felt it was essential to reduce overcrowding by erecting more residential property and exceed that which was provided by private landlords. The final spur for the LCC to commence works in the area was the new law of 1923 that provided government funding to enable residential developments to be built by local governments. As a result, the Downham Estate was developed towards the end of the 1920s by the LCC.

===Historic demography===
The area of the estate was in the region of 522 acres (2.1 km2), with 461 acres (1.9 km2) in the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, (from 1965 the London Borough of Lewisham) and 61 acres (0.2 km2) in the Municipal Borough of Bromley (from 1965 the London Borough of Bromley); the estate stretched for about 1.25 miles (2 km). Prior to this, most of the terrain was countryside. However, parts around Grove Park railway station to the east had already begun to experience some building works. In this territory, which was the then furthest extreme of London, 5659 homes of different sizes were built. 408 apartment complexes of four storeys were also erected.

At the time of development, the area was considered &#x27;a showpiece, a cottage estate&#x27;. With less than 20 houses to an acre, and shops and abundant greenery, the area was of relatively low population density. An official Lewisham publication around 1930 considered Downham to be &#x27;a Garden City&#x27;.

===Downham estate in the 1920s===
Those who were the first to live on the Downham estate late in the 1920s had mostly been relocated from certain less pleasant parts of the inner city like Rotherhithe and East London, and these new homes were of a much higher standard than their previous homes.

The arrival of new people in the Downham area led to some unexpected results. In 1926, residents of Alexandra Crescent (at that time, a private street in Bromley) appointed Albert Frampton, who had developed Alexandra Crescent, to build a dividing wall (the Downham Wall). Some private home owners in Bromley wanted to prevent the working class &#x27;vulgar people&#x27; from the Downham estate from accessing the neighbouring middle-class area. They also wanted to prevent them from using this as an access route into the town centre of Bromley. Frampton made a formal application to Bromley Council on 16 February 1926 to build the dividing wall. The council refused to make a decision on the application, but the brick wall was built nonetheless across Valeswood Road at its junction with Alexandra Crescent and was known as a &#x27;class wall&#x27;. It was seven feet high and was fortified at the top with broken pieces of glass.

That pre-war class wall was a stark reminder of the great increase in gated communities, barrier-walls and the use of private security by wealthier people in various parts of the growing metropolis.

The first Shopping Week took place in June 1929, and both the Downham Tavern and Splendid Super Cinema opened in 1930.

===Downham estate from the 1930s to the 1950s===
By the 1930s, lack of clarity had arisen in regard to responsibilities in relation to the dividing class wall following complaints by LCC to authorities at Lewisham Council. The Town Council of Bromley was firm in its decision not to take down the wall, and curiously neither the LCC nor Lewisham Council felt able to do it either. There were many arguments and controversies about this class wall for close to 25 years. Eventually Bromley Council removed it in 1950 by which time World War 2 had ended. Action was taken largely because passage routes were required for the fire engines.

Despite this minor glitch, the Downham Estate illustrates the nature of developments of council housing in Britain in the period between the first and second world wars. The Downham estate and other projects of this nature around the time (for example Becontree) were built in efforts to reduce the serious housing problem around the city. It was timely in the aftermath of the Second World War when much more housing was needed. The government felt the need to demonstrate the huge potential of public-sector home development especially as there was a need to de-slum and modernise the city. The central government also funded and subsidised such development project which were done in the name of the London County Council.

Among many new developments, Downham Health Clinic opened in Churchdown Road in 1932, Good Shepherd School opened in Moorside Road in 1933, Beckenham Place Park Recreation Area opened in 1936, and both the Downham Library and the Swimming Pool were opened to the public in June 1937.

==Geography==

Downham is bordered by Grove Park, Plaistow, Bromley Hill, Beckenham, Bellingham, Southend and Whitefoot. Green spaces in and close to Downham include Forster Memorial Park, Beckenham Place Park and Downham Fields. Whilst the area lost Woolworths and all its banks, new facilities include Downham Sports and Leisure Centre as well as a Tesco Local. Marks and Spencers now serves as the grocery shop at the BP station which stands on the spot where the 2244-seater Splendid Cinema was in the 1930s. A Quasar Laser tag is located at the south of Downham Way near the Bromley Court Hotel. Bonus Pastor Catholic College is located in Downham with two sites, Churchdown and Winlaton and has a large playing field at Whitefoot Lane with the Green Chain Walk running through.

Neighbourhood Renewal Unit and Lewisham Strategic Partnership have been implementing many projects in the area which include Housing and Environment, Health, Crime and Community Safety, Neighbourhood Management, Community Development, Children and Young People and Employment and Enterprise.

==Education==
Downham has two secondary schools, Bonus Pastor Catholic College and Haberdashers&#x27; Knights Academy (formerly Malory School until 2005).
Primary Schools include Launcelot Primary School, Downderry Primary School, Merlin Primary School (now also part of the academy), Good Shepherd Primary School, Rangefield Primary School, Burnt Ash Primary School and Pendragon Special School for students aged 11 to 16 years.

<doc id="544382" wikidata="Q4887460" url="?curid=544382" title="Benefit tourism">
<text>Benefit tourism is a political term coined in the 1990s and later used for the perceived threat that a huge number of citizens from eight of the ten new nations given membership in the European Union in the 2004 enlargement of the European Union would move to the existing member states to benefit from their social welfare systems rather than to work. This threat was in several countries used as a reason for creating temporary work or benefit restrictions for citizens from the eight new member states.

== Criticism ==
Claims of benefit tourism by EU citizens have been described as unfounded and misleading by research organisations. A major study by the Centre for Research and Migration at University College London, published in 2009, demonstrated that EU migrants to Britain from the new member countries were better educated, more likely to be in employment and much less likely to be claiming benefits than UK-born nationals.

Scare stories of benefits tourism propagated by some media in the UK have been described as &#x27;baseless&#x27; by the Migrants&#x27; Rights Network, which in March 2011 pointed out that EU migrants must meet the usual Habitual Residence Tests in order to register for British National Insurance (without a National Insurance number you can&#x27;t receive any benefits), and are in fact moving to other areas of the EU where employment opportunities are better.

In 2013 the European Commission ordered an EU wide study on the impact of mobile EU citizens on national social security systems. This study confirmed that the vast majority of EU migrants move to find or take up employment. No evidence was found that the main motivation of EU citizens to migrate was benefit-related. On average immigrants received less benefits than nationals of the Member State where they are residing.

Another study conducted in 2014 concentrated on the UK specifically. This study showed that from 2001 to 2011, EU migrants that recently arrived in the UK had paid £20 billion in taxes to the UK treasury, after deduction of the benefits they received in that same period.

<doc id="544386" wikidata="Q117540" url="?curid=544386" title="Collegium Musicum">
<text>The Collegium Musicum was one of several types of musical societies that arose in German and German-Swiss cities and towns during the Reformation and thrived into the mid-18th century.

Generally, while societies such as the (chorale) cultivated vocal music for church performance and the convivium musicum discussed musical philosophy over a banquet, the collegia musica performed both vocal and instrumental music for pleasure; they focused on instrumental music as it rose in stature during the Baroque era. Though closed amateur societies in concept, collegia frequently included professionals to fill out the music and admitted non-members to performances. Moreover, they often provided music for church, state, and academic occasions and gained the patronage of leading citizens. From the 1660s, their functions largely constituted the beginnings of public concert life in Germany.

==Leipzig==
Leipzig collegia musica, consisting mostly of university students, enjoyed a succession of particularly illustrious directors, including Johann Kuhnau (1688), refounded by Telemann (1702), and Bach (1729–1737), who composed several concertos and dramme per musica for weekly performances at Café Zimmermann, Gottfried Zimmerman&#x27;s coffeehouse, and for &quot;extraordinary&quot; concerts. Telemann went on to promote professional concerts by Frankfurt and Hamburg collegia in the late 1720s, thus fostering the emergence of public subscription concerts in Germany. With the Moravian emigration, American collegia sprang up beginning in 1744 in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, and the Carolinas.

In 1909, Hugo Riemann refounded the Leipzig collegium within the university, initiating a widespread modern trend in German and American universities to foster the performance of early music on original instruments or replicas. The term &quot;collegium musicum&quot; has thus come to be associated in large measure with university ensembles that perform early music, though from a historical perspective, the term need not imply any restriction in repertory.

==Other cities==
Although the became the most famous, due to its association with Bach, other cities had similar institutions. The Collegium Musicum (Hamburg) was an amateur musical ensemble founded in Hamburg in the 17th century by Matthias Weckmann, as a complement to the professional Hamburger Ratsmusik.

==Modern ensembles==

<doc id="544389" wikidata="Q332783" url="?curid=544389" title="John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel John Jacob Astor V, 1st Baron Astor of Hever, DL (20 May 1886 – 19 July 1971) was an American-born English newspaper proprietor, politician, sportsman, and military officer. He was a member of the Astor family.

==Biography==
===Early life===
John Jacob Astor V was born in Manhattan, New York City in 1886, the fourth child of William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor (1848–1919), and Mary Dahlgren Paul (1858–1894). He was five years old when his family left New York to live in England. He was raised on an estate purchased by his father at Cliveden-on-Thames in Buckinghamshire. He was educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford. Astor was British Public Schools rackets champion in 1904–1905, spent a year at Oxford, and finally, in 1906, joined the 1st Life Guards.


Astor represented Great Britain in rackets at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal in the men&#x27;s doubles competition together with Vane Pennell and winning bronze in the men&#x27;s singles event. In the same year he played singles and doubles in the British Army rackets championships. He was then Aide-de-Camp to Baron Hardinge, Viceroy of India between 1911 and 1914 and was promoted Captain in 1913.

===First World War===
In World War I, he was wounded while serving with his regiment at Messines in October 1914. After recovering, he returned to the Western Front, returning briefly to marry Lady Violet Mary Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound (28 May 1889 - 3 January 1965) on 28 August 1916. She was the third daughter of Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto and his wife, Lady Mary Caroline Grey. From her previous marriage to Major Lord Charles George Francis Mercer Nairne Petty-Fitzmaurice, who was killed in action at Ypres in 1914, Lady Violet had two children, Margaret and George.

At the start of 1918, he was put in command of the 520 Household Siege Battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery, his bravery with that unit earning him the rank of &quot;Chevalier&quot; in France&#x27;s &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;. In September that year, near Cambrai, his right leg was shattered by a shell and later amputated, though he was still able to play and win against younger opponents at squash on a prosthetic limb.

===1919-1949===
Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1919, Astor inherited Hever Castle, near Edenbridge, Kent, where he lived the life of an English country gentleman. He was promoted to Major in the Army in 1920. In 1922, he purchased &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper following the death of its owner, Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe. He was a director of the Great Western Railway (1929-1946), Hambros Bank (1934-1960) and Barclays Bank (1942-1952). 

In addition to his directorships and newspaper business, John Jacob V served in politics as Alderman of the London County Council between 1922 and 1925 and in the Parliament of the United Kingdom for 23 years as Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover from 1922 to 1945. In March 1924, Astor caused the 1924 Dover by-election to be held after having voted before taking the oath of allegiance - doing so means an MP&#x27;s seat is vacated &quot;as if he were dead&quot;. He was returned unopposed just six days after losing his seat.
In 1926, he was made Lieutenant of the City of London, then held the offices of Justice of the Peace from 1929 and Deputy Lieutenant of Kent from 1936 until 1962. 

In 1927, he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Kent and Sussex Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery, a post he held until 1946, then Honorary Colonel of the 23rd London Regiment in 1928, holding that post until 1949. During World War II, he also became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 5th Battalion, City of London Home Guard, a unit drawn from newspaper employees, between 1940 and 1944.

===Middlesex Hospital===
John Astor was a great benefactor of the Middlesex Hospital, London W 1, both financially and in service given. He was a member of its Board of Governors for 40 years and the Board&#x27;s chairman for 24 years. He also endowed the Chair of Physiology in 1920 and gave the money for the Nurses&#x27; Home in Foley Street, which survived the demolition of the Hospital. For many years, the name of the donor was unknown, but it was later named John Astor House in his honour. He gave money towards the Windeyer Building of the Medical School and Astor College, the medical students&#x27; residence.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, Astor became Chairman of Phoenix Insurance (1952-1958), having previously served as its vice-chairman (1941-1952). In 1953, he had &quot;The Times&quot; sponsor Edmund Hillary&#x27;s expedition that made the first successful climb to the summit of Mount Everest and became the first chairman of the newly-established General Council of the Press, a post he held until resigning due to ill-health in April 1955. 

On 21 January 1956, he was created Baron Astor of Hever, &quot;of Hever Castle in the County of Kent&quot;, taking his seat in the House of Lords on 21 March. He remained chairman of &quot;The Times&quot; until 1959 when his son Gavin took over, seven years before it was sold to Canadian newspaper tycoon, Roy Thomson.

===Death===
In 1962, he moved from England to France. He died on 19 July 1971 in Cannes, France. Selected artworks from the family&#x27;s vast collection were bequeathed to the National Gallery including the prized &quot;Thames below Westminster&quot; by Claude Monet. John Jacob V and Violet are buried together on the grounds of Hever Castle, and his eldest son Gavin succeeded him as Baron.

==Issue==
Lord and Lady Astor had three sons:

* Gavin Astor, 2nd Baron Astor of Hever (1 June 1918 - 28 June 1984), married Lady Irene Haig, youngest daughter of Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, and Dorothy Maud Vivian, and had five children including John Jacob &quot;Johnny&quot; Astor VIII.
* Lt Col Hugh Waldorf Astor (20 November 1920 - 7 June 1999) married Emily Lucy Kinloch, a niece of Diana Vreeland, and had five children.
*John Astor (26 September 1923 - 27 December 1987), married Diana Kathleen Drummond, a grandniece of Herbert Samuel Holt, and had three children.

Through his son Gavin Astor, 2nd Baron Astor of Hever, he is a great-grandfather of Harry Marcus George Lopes (b. 1977), who married Laura Rose Parker Bowles, the second child of Andrew Parker Bowles and Queen Camilla, thus making her the stepdaughter of King Charles III.

<doc id="544390" wikidata="Q844266" url="?curid=544390" title="Special territories of members of the European Economic Area">
<text>The special territories of members of the European Economic Area (EEA) are the 32 special territories of EU member states and EFTA member states which, for historical, geographical, or political reasons, enjoy special status within or outside the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.

The special territories of EU member states are categorised under three headings: nine Outermost Regions (OMR) that form part of the European Union, though they benefit from derogations from some EU laws due to their geographical remoteness from mainland Europe; thirteen Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) that do not form part of the European Union, though they cooperate with the EU via the Overseas Countries and Territories Association; and ten special cases that form part of the European Union (with the exception of the Faroe Islands), though EU laws make &quot;ad hoc&quot; provisions. The Outermost Regions were recognised at the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, and confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that both primary and secondary European Union law applies automatically to the outermost regions, with possible derogations due to the particularities of these territories. The Overseas Countries and Territories are recognised by Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which allows them to opt into EU provisions on the freedom of movement for workers and freedom of establishment, and invites them to join the Overseas Countries and Territories Association (OCTA) in order to improve cooperation with the European Union. The status of an uninhabited territory, Clipperton, remains unclear since it is not explicitly mentioned in primary EU law and has a &quot;sui generis&quot; status at the national level. Collectively, the special territories encompass a population of some 6.1 million people and a land area of about 2,733,792 square kilometres (1,055,500 sq mi). Around 80 percent of this area is represented by Greenland. The largest region by population, the Canary Islands, accounts for more than a third of the total population of the special territories. The smallest by land area is the island of Saba in the Caribbean (13 km2 or 5 sq mi). The French Southern and Antarctic Lands is the only special territory without a permanent population.

== Outermost Regions ==
The Outermost Regions (OMR) are territories forming part of a member state of the European Union but situated a significant distance from mainland Europe. Due to this situation, they have derogation from some EU policies despite being part of the European Union.

According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, both primary and secondary European Union law applies automatically to these territories, with possible derogations to take account of their &quot;structural social and economic situation (...) which is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development&quot;. All form part of the European Union customs area; however, some fall outside of the Schengen Area and the European Union Value Added Tax Area.

Seven Outermost Regions were recognised at the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. The Treaty of Lisbon included two additional territories (Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin) in 2007. Saint Barthélemy changed its status from OMR to OCT with effect from 1 January 2012. Mayotte, which was an OCT, joined the EU as an OMR with effect from 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD 2013/61/EU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9 Outermost Regions of the European Union are:

=== Autonomous Regions of Portugal ===
Azores and Madeira are two groups of Portuguese islands in the Atlantic. Azores and Madeira are integral parts of the Portuguese Republic, but both have the special status as Autonomous Regions, with a degree of self-governance. Some derogations from the application of EU law apply in regards to taxation, fishing and transportation. Their VAT is lower than the rest of Portugal, but they are not outside the EU VAT Area.

=== Canary Islands ===
The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago off the African coast which form one of the 17 autonomous communities of Spain–the country&#x27;s principal first-level administrative division. They are outside the EU VAT Area. The Canary Islands are the most populous and economically strongest territory of all the outermost regions in the European Union. The outermost regions office for support and information is located in these islands, in the city of Las Palmas on the island of Gran Canaria.

=== French overseas regions ===
French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion are five French overseas regions (which are also overseas departments) which under French law are, for the most part, treated as integral parts of the Republic. The euro is legal tender; however, they are outside the Schengen Area and the EU VAT Area.

Mayotte is the newest of the five overseas departments, having changed from an overseas collectivity with OCT status on 31 March 2011. It became an outermost region, and thus part of the EU, on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD 2013/61/EU2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collectivity of Saint Martin ===
Saint Martin is the only overseas collectivity of France with the status of being an Outermost Region of the EU. As with the French overseas departments, the euro is legal tender in Saint Martin, and it is outside the Schengen Area and the EU VAT Area.

On 22 February 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were broken away from the French overseas department of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities. As a consequence their EU status was unclear for a time. While a report issued by the French parliament suggested that the islands remained within the EU as outermost regions, European Commission documents listed them as being outside the European Community. The legal status of the islands was clarified on the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which listed them as an outermost region. However, Saint Barthélemy ceased being an outermost region and left the EU, to become an OCT, on 1 January 2012.

== Overseas countries and territories ==
The overseas countries and territories (OCT) are dependent territories that have a special relationship with one of the member states of the EU. Their status is described in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and they are not part of the EU or the European Single Market. The Overseas Countries and Territories Association was created to improve economic development and cooperation between the OCTs and the EU, and includes most OCTs except three territories which do not have a permanent local population.

The OCTs have been explicitly invited by the EU treaty to join the EU-OCT Association (OCTA). They were listed in the Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which aside from inviting them to join OCTA, also provided them the opportunity to opt into EU provisions on the freedom of movement for workers and freedom of establishment. Yet, the freedom of establishment is limited by Article 203 TFEU and the respective Council Decision on OCTs. Its Article 51(1)(a) prescribes only that &quot;the Union shall accord to natural and legal persons of the OCTs a treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment applicable to like natural and legal persons of any third country with whom the Union concludes or has concluded an economic integration agreement.&quot; Again this can be, according to Article 51(2)(b) limited. The obligations provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to treatment granted under measures providing for recognition of qualifications, licences or prudential measures in accordance with Article VII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) or the GATS Annex on Financial Services.

The OCTs are not subject to the EU&#x27;s common external customs tariffs but may claim customs on goods imported from the EU on a non-discriminatory basis. They are not part of the EU and the EU acquis does not apply to them, though those joining OCTA are required to respect the detailed rules and procedures outlined by this association agreement (Council Decision 2013/755/EU). OCTA members are entitled to ask for EU financial support.

When the Rome Treaty was signed in March 1957, a total of 15 OCTs existed: French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Comoros Archipelago, French Madagascar, French Somaliland, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, French Togoland, French Cameroons, Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, Trust Territory of Somalia, Netherlands New Guinea. The list was since then revised multiple times, and comprised—as noted by the Lisbon Treaty—25 OCTs in 2007. One of the French territories subsequently switched status from OMR to OCT (Saint Barthélemy), while another French territory switched from OCT to OMR (Mayotte). As of July 2014, there are still 13 OCTs (six with France, six with the Netherlands and one with Denmark) of which all have joined OCTA.

The 13 Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union are:

===Overseas Countries and Territories Association===
The Overseas Countries and Territories Association (OCTA) is an organisation founded on 17 November 2000 and headquartered in Brussels. All OCTs have joined OCTA as of February 2020. Its purpose is to improve economic development in overseas countries and territories, as well as cooperation with the European Union. On 25 June 2008, a Cooperation Treaty between the EU and OCTA was signed in Brussels. The current chairman is Louis Mapou.

=== French overseas territories ===

The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (which also include the French Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean, and the French claim of Adélie Land) are a disputed French Overseas Territory embodying the French claims to Antarctica but has no permanent population. It has &quot;sui generis&quot; status within France.

Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna are overseas collectivities (formerly referred to as overseas territories) of France, while New Caledonia is a &quot;&quot;sui generis&quot; collectivity&quot;. Saint Barthélemy and Saint Pierre and Miquelon use the euro, while New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna use the CFP Franc, a currency which is tied to the euro and guaranteed by France. Natives of the collectivities are European citizens owing to their French citizenship and elections to the European Parliament are held in the collectivities.

On 22 February 2007, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin were separated from the French overseas department of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities. As a consequence, their EU status was unclear for a time. While a report issued by the French parliament suggested that the islands remained within the EU as outermost regions, European Commission documents listed them as being outside the European Community. The legal status of the islands was clarified on the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty which listed them as outermost regions. However, Saint Barthélemy ceased being an outermost region and left the EU, to become an OCT, on 1 January 2012. The change was made to facilitate trade with countries outside the EU, notably the United States, and was made possible by a provision of the Lisbon Treaty which allows the European Council to change the EU status of a Danish, Dutch, or French territory on the initiative of the member state concerned.

=== Dutch overseas territories ===

Six territories of the Netherlands—all of which are Caribbean islands—have OCT status. As such, they benefit from being able to have their own export and import policy to and from the EU, while still having access to various EU funds (such as the European Development Fund). The inhabitants of the islands are EU citizens owing to their Dutch citizenship, with the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Initially they did not have voting rights for such elections, but the European Court of Justice granted them such rights, when they ruled their exclusion from the franchise was contrary to EU law, as all other Dutch citizens resident outside the EU did have the right to vote. None of the islands use the euro as their currency. The US dollar is used on Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, while Curaçao and Sint Maarten utilize their own shared currency the Antillean guilder, and finally the currency of Aruba is the Aruban florin.

Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are classified as &quot;countries&quot; under Dutch law, and have considerable internal autonomy. In June 2008, the Dutch government published a report on the projected effect on the islands were they to join the EU as outermost regions. It concluded that the choice would be for the islands themselves to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of becoming part of the EU as outermost regions, and that nothing would be done absent the islands specifically requesting it.
Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba (collectively called Caribbean Netherlands) are &quot;special municipalities&quot; of the Netherlands proper. Their current OCT status, and the prospect of advancing their status to become part of the EU as new OMRs (outermost regions), was reviewed by the Dutch parliament in 2015, as part of the planned review of the Dutch law (WOLBES and FINBES) concerning the quality of their recently implemented new public administration bodies. In October 2015, the review concluded the present legal structures for governance and integration with European Netherlands was not working well within the framework of WolBES, but no recommendations were made in regards of whether a switch from OCT to OMR status would help improve this situation.

The islands inherited their OCT status from the Netherlands Antilles which was dissolved in 2010. The Netherlands Antilles were initially specifically excluded from all association with the EEC by reason of a protocol attached to the Treaty of Rome, allowing the Netherlands to ratify on behalf of the Netherlands in Europe and Netherlands New Guinea only, which it subsequently did. Following the entry into force of the Convention on the association of the Netherlands Antilles with the European Economic Community on 1 October 1964, however, the Netherlands Antilles became OCTs.

=== Greenland ===

Greenland joined the then European Community in 1973 as a county along with Denmark, but after gaining autonomy with the introduction of home rule within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland voted to leave in 1982 and left in 1985, to become an OCT. The main reason for leaving is disagreements about the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and to regain control of Greenlandic fish resources to subsequently remain outside EU waters. Greenlandic nationals (OCT nationals) are, nonetheless, EU citizens due to Greenland&#x27;s associated relationship with the EU within the meaning of EU treaties as well as holding Danish nationality.

The EU–Greenland relationship is a comprehensive partnership, which is complementary to the OCT association arrangements under &quot;Council Decision 2013/755/EU&quot;; based specifically on &quot;Council Decision 2014/137 of 14 March 2014&quot; (outlining the relations) and the Fisheries Partnership Agreement of 30 July 2006.

==Special cases==
While the outermost regions and the overseas countries and territories fall into structured categories to which common mechanisms apply, this is not true of all the special territories. 10 member state territories have &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangements in their relationship with the EU. In those special cases, VAT rules do not apply and they may also be exempt from customs or excise rules.

=== Åland ===
Åland, an autonomous archipelago belonging to Finland, but with partial autonomy, located between Sweden and Finland, with a Swedish-speaking population, joined the EU along with Finland in 1995. The islands had a separate referendum on accession and like the Finnish mainland voted in favour.

EU law, including the fundamental four freedoms, applies to Åland. However, there are some derogations due to the islands&#x27; special status. Åland is outside the VAT area and is exempt from common rules in relation to turnover taxes, excise duties and indirect taxation.
In addition, to protect the local economy, the treaty of accession allows for a concept of &quot;hembygdsrätt/kotiseutuoikeus&quot; (regional citizenship). Consequently, there are restrictions on the holding of property and real estate, the right of establishment for business purposes and limitations on who can provide services in Åland, for people not holding this status. The status may be obtained by any Finnish citizen legally resident in Åland for 5 years who can demonstrate an adequate knowledge of the Swedish language.

===Büsingen am Hochrhein===
The German village of Büsingen am Hochrhein is an exclave entirely surrounded by Switzerland and as such is for practical purposes, in a customs union with the latter non-EU country. The euro is legal tender, though the Swiss franc is preferred. Büsingen is excluded from the EU customs union and the EU VAT area. Swiss VAT generally applies. Büsingen was also outside of the Schengen area until Switzerland joined on 12 December 2008.

===Campione d&#x27;Italia and Livigno===
The Italian exclave village of Campione d&#x27;Italia is enclaved by Switzerland&#x27;s Ticino canton as well as Lake Lugano (or Ceresio), and is a &quot;comune&quot; in the Province of Como, whilst Livigno, a small and remote mountain resort town, is a &quot;comune&quot; in the Province of Sondrio. Both &quot;comuni&quot; are part of the Lombardy region. Although part of the EU, Livigno is excluded from the customs union and VAT area, with Livigno&#x27;s tax status dating back to Napoleonic times. Campione is excluded from the EU VAT area. It was excluded from the EU customs area until the end of 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;2019/474&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shops and restaurants in Campione accept payments in both euros and Swiss francs and prices are displayed in both currencies.

===Ceuta and Melilla===

Ceuta and Melilla are two Spanish cities on the North African coast. They are part of the EU but they are excluded from the common agricultural and fisheries policies. They are also outside the customs union and VAT area, but no customs are levied on goods exported from the Union into either Ceuta and Melilla and certain goods originating in Ceuta and Melilla are exempt from customs charges.

While nominally part of the Schengen Area (Schengen visas are valid), Spain performs identity checks on all sea and air passengers leaving the enclaves for elsewhere in the Schengen Area.

===Cyprus===

When the Republic of Cyprus became part of the European Union on 1 May 2004, the northern third of the island was outside of the effective control of its government due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, a United Nations buffer zone of varying width separated the two parts, and a further 3% of the island was taken up by UK sovereign bases (under British sovereignty since the Treaty of Establishment in 1960). Two protocols to the Treaty of Accession 2003—numbers 3 and 10, known as the &quot;Sovereign Base Areas Protocol&quot; and the &quot;Cyprus Protocol&quot; respectively – reflect this complex situation.

EU law only applies fully to the part of the island that is effectively controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus. EU law is suspended in the northern third of the island (the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, whose independence is recognised only by Turkey) by article 1(1) of the Cyprus Protocol. If the island is reunified, the Council of the European Union will repeal the suspension by a decision. Four months after such a decision has been adopted, new elections to the European Parliament will be held on the island to elect Cypriot representatives from the whole of the island.

Cypriot nationality law applies to the entire island and is accordingly available to the inhabitants of Northern Cyprus and the British sovereign base areas on the same basis as to those born in the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus. Citizens of the Republic of Cyprus living in Northern Cyprus are EU citizens and are nominally entitled to vote in elections to the European Parliament; however, elections to that Parliament are not organised in Northern Cyprus as it is governed de facto by a separate state, albeit a state recognized only by Turkey.

====Akrotiri and Dhekelia====
The United Kingdom has two sovereign base areas on Cyprus, namely Akrotiri and Dhekelia. Unlike other British overseas territories, their inhabitants (who are entitled to British Overseas Territories Citizenship) have never been entitled to British citizenship.

Prior to Cypriot accession to the EU in 2004, although the United Kingdom was an EU member at the time, EU law did not apply to the sovereign base areas. This position was changed by the Cypriot accession treaty so that EU law, while still not applying in principle, applied to the extent necessary to implement a protocol attached to that treaty. This protocol applied EU law relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, customs, indirect taxation, social policy and justice and home affairs to the sovereign base areas. The sovereign base areas&#x27; authorities also made provision for the unilateral application of directly applicable EU law. The UK also agreed in the Protocol to keep enough control of the external (i.e. off-island and northern Cyprus) borders of the base areas to ensure that the border between the sovereign base areas and the Republic of Cyprus could remain fully open and would not have to be policed as an external EU border. Consequently, the sovereign base areas would have become a &quot;de facto&quot; part of the Schengen Area if and when Cyprus implemented it. The base areas are already &quot;de facto&quot; members of the eurozone due to their previous use of the Cypriot pound and their adoption of the euro as legal tender from 2008.

Because Cypriot nationality law extends to Cypriots in the sovereign base areas, Cypriot residents, as citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, are entitled to EU citizenship. Just under half of the population of the sovereign base areas are Cypriots, the rest are British military personnel, support staff and their dependants. In a declaration attached to the Treaty of Establishment of the Republic of Cyprus of 1960, the British government undertook not to allow new settlement of people in the sovereign base areas other than for temporary purposes.

Under a protocol to the Brexit withdrawal agreement, certain provisions of EU law on agriculture, customs, indirect taxation, social security and border control continue to apply to the sovereign base areas.

====United Nations buffer zone====
The United Nations buffer zone between north and south Cyprus ranges in width from a few metres in central Nicosia to several kilometres in the countryside. While it is nominally under the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, it is effectively administered by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The population of the zone is 8,686 (as of October 2007), and one of the mandates of UNFICYP is &quot;to encourage the fullest possible resumption of normal civilian activity in the buffer zone&quot;. Inhabited villages located in the buffer zone are legally administered by the Republic of Cyprus but policed by UN peacekeepers. Article 2.1 of the Cyprus Protocol allows the European Council to determine to what extent the provisions of EU law apply in the buffer zone.

===Faroe Islands===
The Faroe Islands have never been part of the EU. Danish citizens residing on the islands are not considered citizens of a member state within the meaning of the treaties or, consequently, citizens of the European Union. However, Faroese people, who are Danish citizens i.e. citizens of the Danish Realm, may become EU citizens by changing their registered residence to the Danish mainland.

The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area, and Schengen visas are not valid. However, the islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Agreement provides that travellers passing between the islands and the Schengen Area are not to be treated as passing the external frontier of the Area. This means that there is no formal passport control, but an identity check at check-in for air or boat travel to the islands where Nordic citizens on intra-Nordic travel need no passport, only showing the ticket plus identity card.

===Heligoland===

Heligoland is an archipelago of Germany situated in the North Sea off the German north-western coast. It is part of the EU, but is excluded from the customs union and the VAT area.

===Monastic community of Mount Athos===
The Monastic community of Mount Athos is an autonomous monastic region of Greece. Greece&#x27;s EU accession treaty provides that Mount Athos maintains its centuries-old special legal status, guaranteed by article 105 of the Greek Constitution. It is part of the customs union but outside the VAT area. Notwithstanding that a special permit is required to enter the peninsula and that there is a prohibition on the admittance of women, it is part of the Schengen Area. The monastery has certain rights to house monks from countries outside the EU. A declaration attached to Greece&#x27;s accession treaty to the Schengen Agreement states that Mount Athos&#x27;s &quot;special status&quot; should be taken into account in the application of the Schengen rules.

===Plazas de Soberanía===
Small islands scattered along the northern coast of Africa, collectively known as the &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot; have been integral parts of Spain since the 15th century and therefore also part of the European Union. Their currency is the euro.

==Areas of extraterritoriality==
The Saimaa Canal and Värska–Ulitina road are two of several distinct travel arrangements that exist or existed because of changes in borders over the course of the 20th century, where transport routes and installations ended up on the wrong side of the border. Some have become superfluous thanks to the Schengen Agreement. These listed examples pass the external EU border.
===Saimaa Canal===
Finland leases the -long Russian part of the Saimaa Canal from Russia and is granted extraterritoriality rights. The area is not part of the EU, it is a special part of Russia. Under the treaty signed by Finnish and Russian governments, Russian law is in force with a few exceptions concerning maritime rules and the employment of canal staff which fall under Finnish jurisdiction. There are also special rules concerning vessels travelling to Finland via the canal. Russian visas are not required for just passing through the canal, but a passport is needed and it is checked at the border. Euros are accepted for the canal fees. Prior to the 50-year lease renewal coming into effect in February 2012, the Maly Vysotsky Island had also been leased and managed by Finland. Since then it has been fully managed by Russian authorities, and is no longer part of the concession territory.

===Värska–Ulitina road===
The road from Värska to Ulitina in Estonia, traditionally the only road to the Ulitina area, goes through Russian territory for one kilometre (0.6 mi) of its length, an area called Saatse Boot. This road has no border control, but there is no connection to any other road in Russia. It is not permissible to stop or walk along the road. This area is a part of Russia but is also a de facto part of the Schengen area.

===Switzerland===
Some roads, railways and tram lines along the border of Switzerland allow transit between two Swiss places through neighbouring countries, or between the border and international airports and railway stations, without customs controls (and before 2008 without passport controls when those where otherwise needed at the Swiss border). See Privileged transit traffic#Switzerland.

== Non-EU countries and territories with partial EU integration ==
Special territories of some other European countries are strongly connected to the European Union. These are as follows:
*special areas of the member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA):
**Norway
***Jan Mayen
***Svalbard: not part of the Schengen area, Norwegian VAT area or the EU single market; free movement of people into the territory regardless of nationality
***Bouvet Island
***Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land are disputed Norwegian territories embodying the Norwegian claims to Antarctica but have no permanent population.
**Switzerland
***Samnaun and Val Sampuoir: outside Swiss VAT area
***Basel Badischer Bahnhof platforms: part of EU Customs Union, VAT area and single market
*the United Kingdom is not a member state of the EU anymore, nevertheless, it has remained an associated country of the Euratom and is set to continue as participant in the EU&#x27;s Joint European Torus and Fusion for Energy joint undertakings, as well as participant in the Euratom Supply Agency, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the executive agencies of the EU, while some of its territories and the Crown Dependencies are to remain partially integrated with the EU:
**Northern Ireland remains under the Northern Ireland Protocol of the Brexit withdrawal agreement de facto part of the European Single Market and the European Union Customs Union for the purposes of goods only, in order to prevent the creation of a customs border on the island of Ireland; along with the remainder of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and the Republic of Ireland, it has continued to form the Common Travel Area outside of the Schengen Area.
**Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a British territory, is partially integrated with Cyprus in the areas of agriculture, currency, customs, indirect taxation, social security and border control.
**Gibraltar, also a British territory, is in negotiations with the EU for an arrangement to participate in the Schengen Area and (with exceptions) the Single Market, pending implementation.

== Summary ==
===Special territories of EU member states===
This table summarises the various components of EU laws applied in the special territories of EU member states. 
===Special territories of other European states===
Special territories of EFTA states and some other European countries also have a special status in regard to EU laws applied.

==Former special territories==
Many currently independent states or parts of such were previously territories of the following EU members since the latter joined the EU or, previously the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC):
* Belgium (with multiple territories, from ECSC formation until 1962)
* France (with multiple territories, from ECSC formation)
* Italy (with Italian Somaliland, from ECSC formation until 1960)
* The Netherlands (with multiple territories, from ECSC formation)
* Portugal (with multiple territories, from 1986 enlargement until 1999 &quot;(de facto)&quot;/2002 &quot;(de jure)&quot;)
* United Kingdom (with multiple territories, from 1973 enlargement)
Most of these territories seceded before the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 and the following years, meaning that cooperation like the EU citizenship, the VAT union or the Eurozone did not exist, so it made less difference to be a special territory then.

These were:
* Cambodia (gained independence from France in 1953), no Community treaty applied there, besides ECSC preferences
* Laos (gained independence from France in 1954), no Community treaty applied there, besides ECSC preferences

* Kiribati (gained independence from the UK in 1979), had OCT status
* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (gained independence from the UK in 1979), had OCT status
* Zimbabwe (gained &quot;de jure&quot; independence from the UK in 1980), no Community treaty applied there, besides ECSC preferences
* Vanuatu (gained independence from the UK and France in 1980), generally had OCT status
* Belize (gained independence from the UK in 1981), had OCT status
* Antigua and Barbuda (gained independence from the UK in 1981), had OCT status
* Saint Kitts and Nevis (gained independence from the UK in 1983), had OCT status

* Timor-Leste (East Timor) (gained independence from Indonesia in 2002, considered under Portuguese administration before that), no Community treaty applied there 

The United Kingdom left the EU in 2020. When it was a member, some of its Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories were partially integrated with the EU.
*Gibraltar was part of the EU and partially inside its single market.
*Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man were not part of the EU, but were in its customs union and enjoyed free trade.
*Akrotiri and Dhekelia continue to have partial integration with Cyprus, an EU member state, even after the UK is no longer an EU member.
*Other territories which were Overseas Territories that year had OCT status.

Additionally in Europe there were special territories in the past that had different status than their &quot;mainland&quot;, because of various reasons, but now are part of a member state. Some of these territories were as follows:
* The Austrian areas of Kleinwalsertal and Jungholz formerly enjoyed a special legal status. The two areas have road access only to Germany, and not directly to other parts of Austria. They were in customs and currency union with Germany and there were no border controls between Kleinwalsertal and Jungholz, respectively, and Germany. When Austria entered the EU (and its customs union) in 1995, the customs union became defunct. The entry into force of the Schengen Agreement for Austria (1997) and the introduction of the euro (2002) caused Kleinwalsertal and Jungholz to lose their remaining legal privileges. It is now legally treated in the same manner as the rest of Austria.
* Saar (merged with the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957), was fully part of the Community as French-administered European territory
* West Berlin (merged with the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990), was subject to the full application of the treaties
* German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was until 1972 on paper a part of one Germany and the European Community, since West Germany, the NATO countries and the European Community did not recognize the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) until 1972. East Germany did not recognize any membership of the EC. The West German government treated trade with East Germany as inter-German trade and not subject to the EC trade tariffs.

The following areas are still special member state territories, but have changed their status. See their entries in the article for details.
* Greenland
* Saint Barthélemy
* Mayotte

<text>The Lantau Link, formerly known as the Lantau Fixed Crossing, is a roadway in Hong Kong forming part of Route 8 linking Lantau Island to Tsing Yi, from which other roads lead to the urban areas of Kowloon and the rest of the New Territories. It is part of the Airport Core Programme centred on the new Hong Kong International Airport on Lantau. The link was officially opened on 27 April 1997, and it opened to traffic on 22 May the same year.

==Infrastructure==
The Lantau Link is long and consists of:
* the Tsing Ma Bridge, a suspension bridge linking Tsing Yi to Ma Wan island
* the Ma Wan Viaduct, a viaduct crossing Ma Wan
* the Kap Shui Mun Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge linking Ma Wan to Lantau Island

Link is split into two traffic levels; the upper level is an open, 3-lane divided highway, while the lower level is a double-track railway line used by the MTR Airport Express and Tung Chung line and also contains two single-lane roads for emergency use in both directions. The speed limit is on the upper level and on the lower level. In normal situations, the lower level is not used except in special circumstances such as strong wind or serious accidents which could lead to the closure of the upper level. The lower level is not connected to Ma Wan.

The Lantau Link is one of the two land passageway connecting Lantau and other parts of Hong Kong; Tuen Mun–Chek Lap Kok Link via Tuen Mun opened on 27 December 2020 as the second land connection, reducing the traffic pressure on Lantau Link.

Near the Tsing Yi end of the Lantau Link is the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge, and the Cheung Tsing and Nam Wan tunnels, the latter of which leads to the Stonecutters Bridge. Tsing Yi is also home to the Lantau Link Visitors Centre, a museum and viewing platform for the Lantau Link.

<text>Nathan Heard (November 7, 1936 – March 16, 2004), sometimes known as Nathan C. Heard, was a best-selling author in the United States, noted for the grim realism of his novels. He is also known as one of the forefathers of street and prison literatures, having written his most famous book, &quot;Howard Street&quot; (1968), while serving time in the Trenton State Penitentiary for armed robbery.

Heard is the son of Blues singer Gladys Heard Johnson (nee&#x27; Pruitt) and laborer Nathan E. Heard. He grew up in Newark, New Jersey, spending much of his life there. After the notoriety of Howard Street, Heard turned his life around and went on to become a guest lecturer.

Heard was also speech writer to Newark&#x27;s first African American Mayor Ken Gibson. He also worked as a contributing writer for Essence Magazine and the New York Times.

He spent some time teaching creative writing at Fresno State College (now known as California State University, Fresno), where he won a teaching award in 1970. He also taught creative writing at Rutgers University.

His other books include &quot;A Cold Fire Burning&quot;, &quot;House of Slammers,&quot; &quot;To Reach a Dream&quot; and &quot;When Shadows Fall&quot;.

His movie credits include &quot;Gordon&#x27;s War&quot; (1973).
He was the featured narrator of the &quot;Ballad of Little Jimmy Scott&quot; (PBS).

He died of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="544400" wikidata="Q846324" url="?curid=544400" title="Polybius square">
<text>The Polybius square, also known as the Polybius checkerboard, is a device invented by the ancient Greeks Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and made famous by the historian and scholar Polybius. The device is used for fractionating plaintext characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols, which is useful for telegraphy, steganography, and cryptography. The device was originally used for fire signalling, allowing for the coded transmission of any message, not just a finite number of predetermined options as was the convention before.

==Basic form==
According to Polybius&#x27; &quot;Histories,&quot; the device was invented by Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and further developed by Polybius himself. The device partitioned the alphabet into five tablets with five letters each (except for the last one with only four). There are no surviving tablets from antiquity. Letters are represented by two numbers from one to five, allowing the representation of 25 characters using only 5 numeric symbols.

The original square used the Greek alphabet laid out as follows:
Modern Greek still uses that same alphabet, as do implementations of the Polybius square in that language. 

With the Latin alphabet, this is the typical form:

This alphabet, and this latter form of the Polybius square, is used when implementing the square in other Western European languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch. 

Each letter is then represented by its coordinates in the grid. For example, &quot;BAT&quot; becomes &quot;12 11 44&quot;. The 26 letters of the Latin/English alphabet do not fit in a 5 × 5 square, two letters must be combined (usually I and J as above, though C and K is an alternative). Alternatively, a 6 × 6 grid may be used to allow numerals or special characters to be included as well as letters.

A 6 × 6 grid is also usually used for the Cyrillic alphabet (the most common variant has 33 letters, but some have up to 37) or Japanese hiragana (see cryptography in Japan).

A key could be used to reorder the alphabet in the square, with the letters (without duplicates) of the key being placed at the beginning and the remaining letters following it in alphabetical order. For example, the key phrase &quot;polybius cipher&quot; would lead to the reordered square below.
== Encryption Principle ==
There are several encryption methods using the Polybius square. Three of them are described below. 
=== Method 1 ===
Let&#x27;s encrypt the word &quot;SOMETEXT&quot; with a Caesar cipher using a shift equal to the side of our square (5). To do it, locate the letter of the text and insert the one immediately below it in the same column for the ciphertext. If the letter is in the bottom row, take the one from the top of the same column.

Thus, after encryption, we get:

=== Method 2 ===
A more complicated method involves a Bifid cipher without a key (or, in other words, with a key of plain alphabet):

The message is transformed into coordinates on the Polybius square, and the coordinates are recorded vertically:

Then the coordinates are read row by row:
 34 25 45 34 43 31 41 54 
Next, the coordinates are converted into letters using the same square:

Thus, after encryption, we get:
=== Method 3 ===

An advanced variation, which involves the following: the obtained primary ciphertext (result From Method 2) is encrypted again. In this case, it is written out without being split into pairs.

 3425453443314154

The resulting sequence of digits is cyclically shifted to the left by one step (an odd number of steps (move 3 to the end)):

 4254534433141543

This sequence is again divided into groups of two:

 42 54 53 44 33 14 15 43

And is replaced with the final ciphertext according to the table:

Thus, after encryption, we get:

==Applications ==

=== Telegraphy ===

In his &quot;Histories,&quot; Polybius outlines the need for effective signalling in warfare, leading to the development of the square. Previously, fire-signalling was useful only for expected, predetermined messages, with no way to convey novel messages about unexpected events. According to Polybius, in the 4th century BCE, Aeneas Tacticus devised a hydraulic semaphore system consisting of matching vessels with sectioned rods labelled with different messages such as &quot;Heavy Infantry&quot;, &quot;Ships&quot;, and &quot;Corn&quot;. This system was slightly better than the basic fire-signalling, but still lacked the ability to convey any needed message. The Polybius square was used to aid in telegraphy, specifically fire-signalling. To send a message, the sender would initially hold up two torches and wait for the recipient to do the same to signal that they were ready to receive the message. The sender would then hold up the first set of torches on his left side to indicate to the recipient which tablet (or row of the square) was to be consulted. The sender would then raise a set of torches on his right side to indicate which letter on the tablet was intended for the message. Both parties would need the same tablets, a telescope (a tube to narrow view, no real magnification), and torches.

The Polybius square has also been used in the form of the &quot;knock code&quot; to signal messages between cells in prisons by tapping the numbers on pipes or walls. It is said to have been used by nihilist prisoners of the Russian Czars and also by US prisoners of war during the Vietnam War.

Arthur Koestler describes the code being used by political prisoners of Stalin in the 1930s in his anti-totalitarian novel &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. (Koestler had been a prisoner-of-war during the Spanish Civil War.) 
Indeed, it can be signalled in many simple ways (flashing lamps, blasts of sound, drums, smoke signals) and is much easier to learn than more sophisticated codes like the Morse code. However, it is also somewhat less efficient than more complex codes.

=== Steganography ===
The simple representation also lends itself to steganography. The figures from one to five can be indicated by knots in a string, stitches on a quilt, contiguous letters before a wider space or many other ways.

=== Cryptography ===
The Polybius square is also used as a basic cipher called the Polybius cipher. This cipher is quite insecure by modern standards, as it is a substitution cipher with characters being substituted for pairs of digits, which is easily broken through frequency analysis.

== Adaptations ==
The Polybius square and the Polybius cipher can be combined with other cryptographic methods such as the ADFGVX cipher, Homophonic cipher and more.

<doc id="544413" wikidata="Q1538710" url="?curid=544413" title="Speak (2004 film)">
<text>Speak is a 2004 American coming-of-age teen drama film written and directed by Jessica Sharzer in her feature directorial debut, based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Laurie Halse Anderson. Starring Kristen Stewart, Michael Angarano, Robert John Burke, Eric Lively, Elizabeth Perkins, D. B. Sweeney, and Steve Zahn, the film follows Melinda Sordino (Stewart), a high school freshman who stops talking after senior student Andy Evans (Lively) rapes her at a party.

&quot;Speak&quot; premiered out of competition at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2004, and was broadcast on Showtime and Lifetime on September 5, 2005. The film received critical acclaim, with particular praise for Stewart&#x27;s performance.

==Plot==

Fourteen-year-old Melinda Sordino begins her first year in high school and struggles on the first day. She has no friends, and appears uncomfortable when speaking to others. On the bus to school, she meets Heather, whom she somewhat befriends. Throughout the day, she is made fun of by several students, repeatedly called a &quot;squealer&quot;. It&#x27;s revealed that that Melinda called the police to a house party during the previous summer. However, her reason for doing so was because she was raped at the party, by popular senior student Andy Evans, but her trauma prevented her from reporting her assault over the telephone or to the police when they arrived.

Melinda’s poor grades on her recent report card prompt her parents to order that she meets with history teacher Mr. Neck, to review options for improving her current grade. In response, she is assigned an essay on a history topic of her choice relating to the turn of the 20th century, to which she chooses the suffragette movement. After refusing to read her paper aloud to her class, Melinda is sent to the principal&#x27;s office, where a meeting occurs with her parents. Despite seemingly befriending Melinda, Heather soon abandons her when the chance for social advancement arises. The only other student with whom Melinda gets along with is her lab partner, Dave Petrakis, who has successfully managed to avoid affiliating himself with a clique.

Over the year, the restoration of Melinda&#x27;s confidence progresses at a slow rate, with some help from Dave and her art teacher, Mr. Freeman. When her former best friend, Rachel Bruin starts dating Andy, Melinda fears that Rachel will be assaulted as well. Melinda meets Rachel at the library and reveals, by writing it on a piece of paper, that Andy raped her. Rachel initially refuses to believe Melinda, thinking that Melinda is lying out of jealousy. However, Rachel soon realizes the truth when confronting Andy; who mentions Melinda&#x27;s name, despite supposedly never meeting any of Rachel&#x27;s friends before. Seeing Andy&#x27;s lies and misogyny, Rachel leaves him and spreads the truth of Melinda&#x27;s assault to the other students.

Exposed as a rapist and a liar, Andy soon corners and threatens Melinda in a custodian closet. Andy demands Melinda take back her accusation, attempting to rape her again. In the struggle, Melinda overpowers him, blinding him with turpentine and holding a shard of glass from a broken mirror to his neck, threatening to kill him. They are found by Melinda&#x27;s distant friend Nicole, as well as other girls from her field hockey team, and the altercation removes any doubt about what happened at the house party. The girls help restrain a now-helpless Andy, as Melinda leaves. Mr. Neck sees Melinda walking away from the scene and asks what was going on, but Melinda doesn&#x27;t respond.

On the way back from the hospital after being treated for her injuries, Melinda rolls down the car window and breathes in deeply. She finally finds the strength to tell her mother, who already suspects something awful, the truth about what happened at the party.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development and Pre-production===
Producer and screenwriter Annie Young Frisbie read the novel and successfully made a bid to get the rights to a film version. Production took place in Columbus, Ohio because a production partner, Matthew Myers, was relocating there with his wife.

===Filming===
Film production took 21 days in August 2003, on a budget of $1 million. Flooding during an especially heavy summer rain caused filming to be temporarily postponed and during that time author Laurie Halse Anderson visited the set with her daughter. Anderson cameos in the film as the lunch lady who gives Melinda the mashed potatoes.

The school scenes for the movie were shot at Eastmoor Academy on the east side of Columbus.

== Release ==
The film premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival and played the film festival circuit, including the Woodstock Film Festival. It later aired simultaneously on the cable networks Showtime and Lifetime on September 5, 2005.

===Reception===
Marilyn Moss of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; gave an overwhelmingly positive write-up, describing the film as, &quot;well-made and extremely touching.&quot; She praised Stewart&#x27;s performance, saying she gave an &quot;understated performance that will touch everyone who sees [the film].&quot; Moss also praised the score and editing, saying it &quot;merges [Stewart&#x27;s] character&#x27;s interior and exterior worlds beautifully.&quot; On his YouTube channel, critic Chris Stuckmann gave the film a retrospective positive review, praising Stewart and Zahn&#x27;s performances, the cinematography, and direction. Stuckmann also said the film feels &quot;at home&quot; for him, because of the filming that took place in Ohio (Stuckmann&#x27;s home state). Barbara Shulgasser-Parker of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the film a rating of four out of five stars, and called it, &quot;a startlingly good film on what has become a familiar subject in both fiction and life.&quot; She praised Stewart&#x27;s performance and the direction. Although Neil Genzlinger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined the film &quot;comes nowhere near capturing the wise, subtle tone of the book it&#x27;s based on&quot;, &quot;[it] is still an effective treatment of a difficult subject, thanks almost entirely to the performance of Kristen Stewart as the young victim.&quot;

Christopher Null of &quot;ContactMusic.com&quot; gave the film a rating of three out of five stars, saying it &quot;is decent, even pretty good at times, but ultimately this material feels so familiar that we see every turn in the story telegraphed from miles away.&quot; Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; called the production values &quot;OK,&quot; but said, &quot;Eventual coming-to-terms (plus the culprit’s public humiliation) would’ve been much more potent with less caricatured adult characters and more nuanced direction.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
In 2006, the film was nominated for a Writers Guild Award. Jessica Sharzer was also nominated for a Directors Guild Award in the category of Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Children&#x27;s Programs.

<text>Hampton Comes Alive is a six-disc live album by the American rock band Phish, released on November 23, 1999, by Elektra Records. It is the band&#x27;s third live album and the first time complete live Phish concerts were released in their entirety (though fan recordings of most Phish shows are widely circulated). &quot;Hampton Comes Alive&quot; consists of two full concerts recorded on November 20 and 21, 1998, at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. The album title is a play on Peter Frampton&#x27;s classic live album &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;.

Twenty of the album&#x27;s forty-five tracks are covers or other songs from the band&#x27;s large catalog that do not appear on any previous Phish album. The album&#x27;s many cover songs include: &quot;Rock and Roll, Pt. 2&quot; by Gary Glitter, &quot;Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)&quot; by Bob Dylan, &quot;Funky Bitch&quot; by Son Seals, &quot;Roses Are Free&quot; by Ween, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy Wit It&quot; by Will Smith, &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; by The Beatles, &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman&quot; by Stevie Wonder, &quot;Nellie Kane&quot; by Hot Rize, &quot;Bold as Love&quot; by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, &quot;Sabotage&quot; by Beastie Boys and &quot;Tubthumping&quot; by Chumbawamba. As usual with covers sung by Jon Fishman, the band (as a trio with Trey Anastasio on drums) also performs a brief instrumental version of &quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot; by Argent before and after &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy Wit It.&quot; The album marked the first time that the songs &quot;Tube&quot;, &quot;Driver&quot;, &quot;Axilla I&quot;, &quot;Possum&quot;, &quot;Piper&quot;, &quot;Farmhouse&quot;, &quot;Big Black Furry Creature from Mars&quot;, &quot;NICU&quot;, &quot;Dogs Stole Things&quot; and &quot;Ha Ha Ha&quot; had appeared on an official Phish release. &quot;Piper&quot; and &quot;Farmhouse&quot; later appeared on the band&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Farmhouse&quot;.

Each CD is packaged in its own sleeve and collected together in an innovative box. The liner notes include fan-contributed photographs and art. The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Boxed Set Packaging.

&quot;Hampton Comes Alive&quot; was certified gold by RIAA January 14, 2000.
In February 2009, this album was made available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.

<doc id="544422" wikidata="Q536985" url="?curid=544422" title="Apostolic Fathers">
<text>The Apostolic Fathers, also known as the Ante-Nicene Fathers, were core Christian theologians among the Church Fathers who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD who are believed to have personally known some of the Twelve Apostles or to have been significantly influenced by them. Their writings, though widely circulated in early Christianity, were not included in the canon of the New Testament. Many of the writings derive from the same time period and geographical location as other works of early Christian literature which came to be part of the New Testament.

== Background ==
The label &quot;Apostolic Fathers&quot; has been applied to these writers only since the 17th century, to indicate that they were thought of as representing the generation that had personal contact with the Twelve Apostles. The earliest known use of the term &quot;Apostolic(al) Fathers&quot; was by William Wake in 1693, when he was chaplain in ordinary to King William and Queen Mary of England. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the use of the term &quot;Apostolic Fathers&quot; can be traced to the title of a 1672 work by Jean-Baptiste Cotelier, &quot;SS. Patrum qui temporibus apostolicis floruerunt opera&quot; (&quot;Works of the holy fathers who flourished in the apostolic times&quot;), which was abbreviated to &quot;Bibliotheca Patrum Apostolicorum&quot; (&quot;Library of the Apostolic Fathers&quot;) by L. J. Ittig in his 1699 edition of the same. The term &quot;apostolic father&quot; first occurs in the Hogedos of Anastasius of the seventh-century, however states that it was never used to refer to a body of writings until later.

The history of the title for these writers was explained by Joseph Lightfoot, in his 1890 translation of the Apostolic Fathers&#x27; works:

...[T]he expression [&#x27;Apostolic Fathers&#x27;] itself does not occur, so far as I have observed, until comparatively recent times. Its origin, or at least its general currency, should probably be traced to the idea of gathering together the literary remains of those who flourished in the age immediately succeeding the Apostles, and who presumably therefore were their direct personal disciples. This idea first took shape in the edition of Cotelier during the last half of the seventeenth century (A.D. 1672). Indeed such a collection would have been an impossibility a few years earlier. The first half of that century saw in print for the first time the Epistles of Clement (A.D. 1633), and of Barnabas (A.D. 1645), to say nothing of the original Greek of Polycarp&#x27;s Epistle (A.D. 1633) and the Ignatian Letters in their genuine form (A.D. 1644, 1646). The materials therefore would have been too scanty for such a project at any previous epoch. In his title page however Cotelier does not use the actual expression, though he approximates to it, &quot;SS. Patrum qui temporibus Apostolicis floruerunt opera&quot;; but the next editor [Thomas] Ittig (1699), adopts as his title &quot;Patres Apostolici&quot;, and thenceforward it becomes common.

==List of works==
The following writings are generally grouped together as having been written by the Apostolic Fathers (in italics are writings whose authors are unknown):
*Letters attributed to Clement of Rome
**The First Epistle of Clement
**The &quot;Second Epistle of Clement&quot; (contested authorship; see § Clement of Rome)
*Seven epistles of Ignatius of Antioch
*The &quot;Martyrium Ignatii&quot;
*The Epistle of Polycarp
*The &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot;
*Fragments of the writings of Papias of Hierapolis, which have survived as quotations in later writers
*One short fragment of the Apology of Quadratus of Athens
*The &quot;Didache&quot;
*The &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot;
*The &quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot;
*The &quot;Shepherd of Hermas&quot;
Additionally some have argued that the Odes of Solomon was written by a student of the Apostle John around the middle of the first century.

All or most of these works were originally written in Greek. Older English translations of these works can be found online in the &quot;Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot; series on the Christian Classics Ethereal Library website. Published English translations have also been made by various scholars of early Christianity, such as Joseph Lightfoot, Kirsopp Lake, Bart D. Ehrman and Michael W. Holmes. The first English translation of the Apostolic Fathers&#x27; works was published in 1693, by William Wake, then rector of Westminster St James, later Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;.&quot; It was virtually the only English translation available until the mid-19th century. Since its publication many better manuscripts of the Apostolic Fathers&#x27; works have been discovered.

==Fathers==

===Clement of Rome===
Clement of Rome (–99) was bishop of Rome from 88 to 99. Irenaeus and Tertullian list him as the fourth bishop after Peter, Linus and Anacletus. He was said to have been consecrated by Peter the Apostle, and he is known to have been a leading member of the Church in Rome in the late 1st century.

The First Epistle of Clement () was copied and widely read and is generally considered to be the oldest Christian epistle in existence outside of the New Testament. The letter is extremely lengthy, twice as long as the Epistle to the Hebrews, and it demonstrates the author&#x27;s familiarity with many books of both the Old Testament and New Testament. The epistle repeatedly refers to the Old Testament as scripture and includes numerous references to the Book of Judith, thereby establishing usage or at least familiarity with Judith in his time. Within the letter, Clement calls on the Christians of Corinth to maintain harmony and order. Tradition identifies the author as Clement, bishop of Rome, and scholarly consensus is overwhelmingly in favor of the letter&#x27;s authenticity.

The Second Epistle of Clement was traditionally ascribed by some ancient authors to Clement, but it is now generally considered to have been written later, , and therefore could not be the work of Clement, who died in 99. Doubts about the authorship of the letter had already been expressed in antiquity by Eusebius and Jerome. Whereas 1 Clement was an epistle, 2 Clement appears to be a transcript of an oral homily or sermon, making it the oldest surviving Christian sermon outside of the New Testament.

===Ignatius of Antioch===
Ignatius of Antioch (also known as Theophorus, from the Greek for &quot;God-bearer&quot;) () was bishop of Antioch. He may have known the apostle John directly, and his thought is certainly influenced by the tradition associated with this apostle. En route to his martyrdom in Rome, Ignatius wrote a series of letters which have been preserved as an example of the theology of the earliest Christians. Important topics addressed in these letters include ecclesiology, the sacraments, the role of bishops, and the nature of biblical Sabbath. He clearly identifies the local-church hierarchy composed of bishop, presbyters, and deacons and claims to have spoken in some of the churches through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. He is the second after Clement to mention the Pauline epistles.

===Polycarp of Smyrna===

Polycarp ( – ) was bishop of Smyrna (now İzmir in Turkey). His student Irenaeus wrote that he &quot;was not only instructed by the apostles, and conversed with many who had seen the Lord, but was also appointed bishop by apostles in Asia and in the church in Smyrna&quot;, and that he had, as a boy, listened to &quot;the accounts which (Polycarp) gave of his intercourse with John and with the others who had seen the Lord&quot;. The options for this John are John the son of Zebedee, traditionally viewed as the author of the Fourth Gospel, or John the Presbyter. Traditional advocates follow Eusebius in insisting that the apostolic connection of Papius was with John the Evangelist, and that this John, the author of the Gospel of John, was the same as the apostle John.

Polycarp tried and failed to persuade Anicetus, bishop of Rome, to have the West celebrate Easter on 14 Nisan, as in the East. He rejected the bishop&#x27;s suggestion that the East use the Western date. In 155, the Smyrnans demanded Polycarp&#x27;s execution as a Christian, and he died a martyr. His story has it that the flames built to kill him refused to burn him, and that when he was stabbed to death, so much blood issued from his body that it quenched the flames around him. Polycarp is recognized as a saint in both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

=== Papias of Hierapolis ===
Papias of Hierapolis () was bishop of Hierapolis (now Pamukkale in Turkey). Irenaeus describes him as &quot;an ancient man who was a hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp&quot;. Eusebius adds that Papias was Bishop of Hierapolis around the time of Ignatius of Antioch. The name &quot;Papias&quot; (Παπίας) was very common in the region, suggesting that he was probably a native of the area.

Papias&#x27;s major work was the &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; (Greek: Λογίων Κυριακῶν Ἐξήγησις) in five books; it has been lost and only survives in excerpts from Iraeneus and Eusebius. Other fragments come from the works of Philip of Side and George Hamartolos, but the authenticity of those are dubious.

=== Quadratus of Athens ===
Quadratus of Athens (died ) was bishop of Athens. Eusebius reports that he was a disciple of the apostles (&quot;auditor apostolorum&quot;) and that he was appointed as bishop after the martyrdom of his predecessor Publius. Quadratus&#x27;s major work is the &quot;Apology&quot;, which was apparently read to Emperor Hadrian to convince him to improve imperial policy toward Christians. It has been lost and only survives in an excerpt from Eusebius.

== Other sub-apostolic literature ==

===&quot;Didache&quot;===
The &quot;Didache&quot; () is a brief early Christian treatise, dated anywhere from as early as AD 50 to the end of the 1st century. It contains instructions for Christian communities. The text, parts of which may have constituted the first written catechism, has three main sections dealing with Christian lessons, rituals such as baptism and the Eucharist, and church organization. It was considered by some of the Church Fathers as part of the New Testament but rejected as spurious (non-canonical) by others. Scholars knew of the &quot;Didache&quot; through references in other texts, but the text had been lost; it was rediscovered in 1873 by Philotheos Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicomedia, in the Codex Hierosolymitanus.

===&quot;Shepherd of Hermas&quot;===
The 2nd-century &quot;The&quot; &quot;Shepherd of Hermas&quot; was popular in the early church and was even considered scriptural by some of the Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Tertullian. It was written in Rome in Koine Greek. The &quot;Shepherd&quot; had great authority in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The work comprises five visions, 12 mandates, and 10 parables. It relies on allegory and pays special attention to the Church, calling the faithful to repent of the sins that have harmed it.

===&quot;Epistle to Diognetus&quot;===
The Epistle to Diognetus, sometimes called Mathetes or Epistle of Mathetes to Diogentus, is the first extant Christian apology. In the apology, the anonymous author explains to a pagan friend who wants to know more about the new religion. The epistle talks mainly about the incarnation of Logos (Jesus Christ), the errors of paganism and Judaism, and explain about the Christian lifestyle. This work is thought to have been written around 130 AD.

==Theology==
The writings of the Apostolic Fathers reveal the development of distinct theological schools or orientations: Asia Minor and Syria, Rome, and Alexandria. The school of Asia Minor (represented by the Johannine literature, Ignatius, Polycarp, and Papias) stressed union with Christ for attaining eternal life. For Ignatius, the eucharist unites the believer to the passion of Christ. He wrote that it was &quot;the medicine of immortality, the antidote which results not in dying but in living forever in Jesus Christ&quot;. The writings of Papias taught historic premillennialism—the belief that the Second Coming will inaugurate Jesus&#x27; thousand year reign on earth (the millennium).

Roman Christianity (represented by Clement and Hermas) was influenced by Stoicism and stressed ethics and morality. Hermas taught that a person could be forgiven once for postbaptismal sin (sins committed after baptism). Hermas also introduced the idea of works of supererogation (to do more than the commandments of God require). This concept would contribute to the later development of the treasury of merit and the Western Church&#x27;s penitential system.

The Alexandrian school (represented by the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot;) was influenced by Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism. It combined a focus on ethics with an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament in the tradition of Philo. The author of the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot; used an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament to harmonize it with Christian teachings. The stories of the Old Testament were understood to be types that point to the saving work of Jesus.

The Apostolic Fathers, all of whom were Gentiles, struggled with the authority of the Old Covenant and the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. The claimed the tablets of the covenant were destroyed at Sinai and that Israel had no covenant with God.

The Apostolic Fathers use Trinitarian language, such as that written by Clement: &quot;Have we not one God and one Christ and one Spirit of grace, the Spirit that has been poured out on us?&quot; While Christology remained undeveloped, the Apostolic Fathers agreed on the pre-existence of Christ, as well as both his divinity and humanity. Ignatius referred to Jesus as &quot;our God&quot; and wrote that &quot;The one God manifested himself through Jesus Christ his Son who is his Word that proceeded from silence&quot;. When opposing Docetism—a movement that denied the humanity of Jesus and therefore his Incarnation—Ignatius wrote, &quot;There is one Physician: both flesh and spirit, begotten and unbegotten, in man, God, in death, true life, both from Mary and from God, first passible and then impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord&quot;. In &quot;The Shephard of Hermas&quot;, the Holy Spirit is conflated with the Son of God: &quot;the holy pre-existent Spirit which created the whole creation God made to dwell in flesh that he desired. This flesh therefore in which the Holy Spirit dwelt was subject to the Spirit... He chose this flesh as a partner with the Holy Spirit&quot;.

The Apostolic Fathers do not seem to share a single concept of church polity or organization. In the &quot;Didache&quot;, prophets are the preeminent leaders of the church with bishops and deacons in subordinate roles. It is possible this arrangement represents &quot;a period of transition between the primitive system of charismatic authority and the hierarchical organization that was slowly developing within the church&quot;. Other writers stress the importance of bishops as leaders of the church. In an early articulation of apostolic succession, Clement teaches that the apostles appointed bishops (or presbyters) and deacons to lead the church. Ignatius provided the earliest description of a monarchical bishop, writing that &quot;all are to respect the deacons as Jesus Christ and the bishop as a copy of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and the band of the apostles. For apart from these no group can be called a church&quot;.

The Apostolic Fathers placed great importance on baptism. According to theologian Geoffrey Hugo Lampe, the Fathers considered baptism to be &quot;the seal with which believers are marked out as God&#x27;s people, the way of death to sin and demons and of rebirth to resurrection-life, the new white robe which must be preserved undefiled, the shield of Christ&#x27;s soldier, the sacrament of the reception of the Holy Spirit.&quot; The Apostolic Fathers also clearly considered the eucharist to be the center of Christian worship. Ignatius identified the eucharist closely with the death and resurrection of Christ—&quot;it is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins and which the Father raised up&quot;.

<doc id="544429" wikidata="Q2474750" url="?curid=544429" title="Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet">
<text>Roy Herbert Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet, (5 June 1894 – 4 August 1976) was a Canadian-born British newspaper proprietor who became one of the moguls of Fleet Street in London.

He first came to prominence when he was selling radios in Ontario, and to give his customers more programmes to listen to, decided to launch his own radio station. He then moved into newspapers, becoming as wealthy and important in Canada as the press barons in the United Kingdom. He aspired to a peerage but was denied it unless he moved residence to the UK. He invited British newspaper owners to sell to him, the first doing so being &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and he soon formed a commercial television company which gained the first ITV franchise in Scotland, the Scottish Television, today known as STV, which is also nowadays the last ITV franchise not to be owned by ITV plc. From the substantial profits of commercial television, he bought many titles such as &quot;The Times&quot; and Kemsley Newspapers which published &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;; both of these are nowadays owned by News UK, a division of News Corp.

==Early life==
Thomson was born on 5 June 1894 as Roy Herbert Thomson in Toronto, then part of York County, Ontario, Canada. His father was Herbert Thomson, a telegraphist turned barber who worked at Toronto&#x27;s Grosvenor Hotel (at the corner of Yonge and Alexander streets – now the site of the Courtyard Marriott), and English-born Alice Maud. The family lived at 32 Monteith Street, off Church Street in Toronto. Thomson&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Hugh Thomson and Mary Nichol Sylvester. Hugh was one of ten children of George Thomson, son of Archibald Thomson (born May 1749).

Thomson&#x27;s ancestors were small tenant farmers on the estates of the Dukes of Buccleuch at Bo&#x27;ness, in the parish of Westerkirk, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. Archibald Thomson emigrated from Westerkirk to Canada (then British North America) in 1773, and married Elizabeth McKay of Quebec. The family eventually settled in Upper Canada, but retained a sentimental attachment to their country of origin. Archibald&#x27;s brother David Thomson was the first European settler of Scarborough, Ontario.

==Career==
During World War I, Roy Thomson attended a business college, and owing to bad eyesight, avoided conscription. He went to Manitoba after the war to become a farmer, but was unsuccessful. Thomson returned to Toronto, where he held several jobs at different times, one of which was selling radio receivers. However, he found selling radios difficult because the only district left for him to work in was Northern Ontario. In order to give his potential customers something to listen to, he undertook to establish a radio station. By a stroke of luck, he was able to procure a radio frequency and transmitter for $201. CFCH officially went on the air in North Bay, Ontario, on 3 March 1931. He sold radio receivers for some time after that, but his focus gradually shifted to the radio station.

Thomson purchased the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot; in Timmins, Ontario, his first newspaper, with a down payment of $200 in 1934 (an equivalent of $3,816 in 2021). He began an expansion of radio stations and newspapers in various Ontario locations in partnership with fellow Canadian Jack Kent Cooke. In addition to his media acquisitions, by 1949 Thomson was the owner of a diverse group of companies, including several ladies&#x27; hairstyling businesses, a fitted kitchen manufacturer, and an ice-cream cone manufacturing operation. By the early 1950s, he owned 19 newspapers and was president of the Canadian Daily Newspaper Publishers Association, and then began his first foray into the British newspaper business by starting up the &quot;Canadian Weekly Review&quot; to cater to expatriate Canadians living in Britain. He aspired to a peerage, similar to the press barons of the UK, and moved across the Atlantic, settling in Edinburgh.

In 1952, Thomson bought &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper in Edinburgh from its impecunious owners. In 1957, Thomson launched a successful bid for the commercial television franchise for Central Scotland, named Scottish Television, basing it in the Theatre Royal, Glasgow. It became highly profitable, with Thomson describing it as a &quot;licence to print money&quot;. In 1959, Thomson purchased the Kemsley group of newspapers, the largest in Britain, which included &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Over the years, Thomson expanded his media empire to include more than 200 newspapers in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. His Thomson Organization became a multinational corporation, with interests in publishing, printing, television, and travel. In 1966, Thomson bought &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper from members of the Astor family.

In the 1970s, Thomson joined with J. Paul Getty in a consortium that successfully explored for oil in the North Sea.

A modest man, who had little time for pretentious displays of wealth, in Britain he got by virtually unnoticed, riding the London Underground to his office each day. Nonetheless, he made his son Kenneth promise to use the hereditary title that he had received in 1964, if only in the London offices of the firm.

== Personal life ==
On 29 July 1916, Thomson married Edna Annis Irvine (1895–1951) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Edna A. Irvine was the daughter of John Irvine and Rebecca Caldwell. 
Thomson had three children: Kenneth Roy Thomson (1923–2006), Irma Jacqueline Thomson (b. 20 October 1918 - d. 1966) and Phyllis Audrey Thomson (b. 6 July 1917 - d. 2007).

On 22 February 1951, Thomson&#x27;s wife Edna died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

In 1952, Thomson moved to Edinburgh.

As of 1964 and 1965, Thomson owned a residence near Port Credit, on Mississauga Road.

In 1976, Thomson died in London, England. A plaque was placed in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

After Thomson&#x27;s death in 1976, his son Kenneth became chair of Thomson Corporation and inherited the baronial title becoming the 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet. With the Thomson operations now principally again in Canada, the younger Thomson did not use his title in Canada though he did so in Britain, and used two sets of stationery reflecting this dichotomy. In any case, as the peerage title he had was inherited, it did not debar him from retaining his Canadian citizenship, and he never took up his right to a seat in the pre-1999 House of Lords.

=== Legacy ===
Roy Thomson Hall, one of Toronto&#x27;s main concert halls, is named in his honour as the Thomson family donated $5.4 million to its construction.
Thomson Student Centre at Memorial University of Newfoundland was named in his honour. It opened 25 May 1968, by the Right Honourable Lord Thomson of Fleet, chancellor of Memorial University of Newfoundland from 1961 to 1968.

=== Descendants ===

Thomson&#x27;s family continues to use the British hereditary title of Baron Thomson of Fleet. A select family tree is shown below:




==Honours==
In the 1964 New Year Honours, it was announced that Thomson would be elevated to the peerage as a Baron &quot;for public services&quot;. On 10 March 1964 he was made Baron Thomson of Fleet, of Northbridge in the City of Edinburgh. In order to receive this title, it was necessary for Thomson to acquire British citizenship, as the Canadian government had made it common practice since 1919 to disallow the conference of titular honours from the sovereign on Canadians. However, the Canadian &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; between 1947 and 1977 stated that any Canadian who became a citizen of another country through means other than marriage would cease to be a Canadian citizen. Thus, Thomson lost his Canadian citizenship in the process.

He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1970 New Year Honours.

In 1972, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<text>Kenneth Roy Thomson, 2nd Baron Thomson of Fleet (September 1, 1923 – June 12, 2006), known in Canada as Ken Thomson, was a Canadian/British businessman and art collector. At the time of his death, he was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the richest person in Canada and the ninth richest person in the world, with a net worth of approximately US $19.6 billion.

==Early life and career==
Thomson was born on September 1, 1923, in Toronto, Ontario. He was the son of Roy Thomson, the founder of the Thomson Corporation.

Thomson was first educated at Upper Canada College before going up to St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he received a degree in economics and law. During World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Following the war, he completed his education and entered the family business, working as a reporter for the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot;, then for the next five years, first as a salesman, later as general manager, for the &quot;Galt&quot; &quot;Reporter&quot;. In 1953, he was appointed head of Thomson Newspapers, and lived in Toronto for thirteen years.

==Business owner==
His father purchased &quot;The Times&quot; in September 1966. Thomson moved to London the following year to become vice-chairman, and a year later chairman, of Times Newspapers Ltd. He returned to Toronto three years later, and in 1971 became joint-chairman, with his father, of the Thomson Organization.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in August 1976, Ken Thomson became chairman of the Thomson Corporation, and succeeded his father as The Lord Thomson of Fleet. Thomson never used his title in Canada, however, and never took up his seat in the House of Lords. In a 1980 interview with &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine, he spoke of honouring a promise to his father: &quot;In London I&#x27;m Lord Thomson; in Toronto I&#x27;m Ken. I have two sets of Christmas cards and two sets of stationery. You might say I&#x27;m having my cake and eating it too.&quot;

At the age of fifty-three, Thomson inherited a media empire of over two-hundred newspaper and television holdings, which also continued to reap profits from a subsidiary North Sea oil investment his father had made a few years earlier. He acquired the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1979, and purchased &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in Toronto in 1980.

In the 1980s and 90s Thomson presided over a number of divestitures, selling &quot;The Times&quot; to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation in 1981, the North Sea oil holdings in 1989, and Thomson Travel in 1998. In 2001, The &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; was combined with BCE&#x27;s cable and television assets (including CTV and The Sports Network) to form Bell Globemedia, controlled by BCE with Thomson as a minority shareholder. The company then sold all of its community newspapers to become a financial data services giant and one of the world&#x27;s most powerful information services and academic publishing companies. Today, the company operates primarily in the US from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. In 2002, The Thomson Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, TOC.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2005, the Thomson family was the richest in Canada, and Kenneth Thomson was the fifteenth richest person in the world, with a personal net worth of US $17.9 billion. At the time of his death a year later, he had climbed to ninth richest, with assets of $19.6 billion.

== Art collector ==
Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Thomson distinguished himself as one of North America&#x27;s leading art collectors. In the 1940s, he began collecting paintings by Cornelius Krieghoff.

In 1977, the famously private Thomson suddenly found his collection had become a top news story—from The Globe and Mail in Toronto, to The Times of London—after he’d quietly invited English art forger Tom Keating to come to his office at the top of Thomson Tower and check if any of his cherished Krieghoffs were fakes. Keating was under investigation by the Art and Antiques squad at Scotland Yard for selling several fake Krieghoffs in the UK, and he claimed to have painted over a hundred of them, mostly in the 1950s. Keating denied finding any of his pastiches in Thomson&#x27;s office, and said it was a marvellous experience to see such a fine collection. In 1989, Thomson opened an eponymous Gallery in downtown Toronto to display some of these pieces.

In November 2002, he announced he would donate in trust around two thousand art works to the Art Gallery of Ontario, including two major acquisitions he had purchased that July: Paul Kane&#x27;s &quot;Scene in the Northwest: Portrait of John Henry Lefroy,&quot; at CA$5.1 million, the highest price ever paid for a Canadian painting, and the highlight of his European collection, Peter Paul Rubens&#x27; 17th-century masterpiece &quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot; for CA$117 million.

The collection features essential works of over a dozen eminent 19th to mid-20th century Canadian artists, including some three hundred paintings from Tom Thomson (no relation) and the Group of Seven, a hundred and forty-five wintry habitant scenes by Cornelius Krieghoff, a hundred mostly impressionistic, modern landscapes by luminary David Milne, as well as works by Paul Kane, Paul-Emile Borduas and William Kurelek.

The lesser-known European Collection includes an assortment of 17th to 20th century British ship models, a series of Medieval and Baroque ivory carvings, and features the 12th-century &quot;Malmesbury châsse,&quot; an ornate casket which once held the bones of a Scottish missionary.

The unprecedented donation of his CA$300 million art collection helped lure Toronto-native starchitect Frank Gehry to design a major expansion and renovation of the AGO, towards which Thomson gave an additional CA$50 million. He also gifted a CA$20 million endowment for gallery operations.

==Retirement==
In 2002, Thomson stepped down as chairman of Thomson Corporation, installing his elder son, David. He retained his positions as Chairman of The Woodbridge Company, the family&#x27;s holding company, which owned a controlling share of Thomson Corporation.

In his final years, Thomson lived at 8 Castle Frank Road (gated estate) in the Rosedale area. Thomson loved to walk his Wheaton terrier in the Rosedale area. He died in 2006 at his Toronto office of an apparent heart attack.

== Personal life ==
In 1956, Thomson married Nora Marilyn Lavis (July 27, 1930 – May 23, 2017) They had three children: David (born 1957), Lynne, who changed her name to Taylor (born 1959), and Peter (born 1965). Taylor, a one-time actress and film producer, became known for her lawsuit against Christie&#x27;s auction house, when in 1994 she bought urns supposedly from Louis XV of France that were discovered instead to be 19th century reproductions.

<doc id="544433" wikidata="Q239816" url="?curid=544433" title="MPTP">
<text>MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) is an organic compound. It is classified as a tetrahydropyridine. It is of interest as a precursor to the monoaminergic neurotoxin MPP+, which causes permanent symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease by destroying dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. It has been used to study disease models in various animals.

While MPTP itself has no psychoactive effects, the compound may be accidentally produced during the manufacture of MPPP, a synthetic opioid drug with effects similar to those of morphine and pethidine (meperidine). The Parkinson-inducing effects of MPTP were first discovered following accidental injection as a result of contaminated MPPP.

==Toxicity==

Injection of MPTP causes rapid onset of Parkinsonism, hence users of MPPP contaminated with MPTP will develop these symptoms.

MPTP itself is not toxic, but it is a lipophilic compound and can therefore cross the blood–brain barrier. Once inside the brain, MPTP is metabolized into the toxic cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) of glial cells, specifically astrocytes. MPP+ kills primarily dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. MPP+ interferes with complex I of the electron transport chain, a component of mitochondrial metabolism, which leads to cell death and causes the buildup of free radicals, toxic molecules that contribute further to cell destruction.

Because MPTP itself is not directly harmful, toxic effects of acute MPTP poisoning can be mitigated by the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as selegiline. MAOIs prevent the metabolism of MPTP to MPP+ by inhibiting the action of MAO-B, minimizing toxicity, and preventing neural death.

Dopaminergic neurons are selectively vulnerable to MPP+ because DA neurons exhibit dopamine reuptake which is mediated by DAT, which also has high-affinity for MPP+. The dopamine transporter scavenges for excessive dopamine at the synaptic spaces and transports them back into the cell. Even though this property is exhibited by both VTA and SNc neurons, VTA neurons are protective against MPP+ insult due to the expression of calbindin. Calbindin regulates the availability of Ca2+ within the cell, which is not the case in SNc neurons due to their high-calcium-dependent autonomous pacemaker activity.

The gross depletion of dopaminergic neurons severely affects cortical control of complex movements. The direction of complex movement is based from the substantia nigra to the putamen and caudate nucleus, which then relay signals to the rest of the brain. This pathway is controlled via dopamine-using neurons, which MPTP selectively destroys, resulting, over time, in parkinsonism.

MPTP causes Parkinsonism in primates, including humans. Rodents are much less susceptible. Rats are almost immune to the adverse effects of MPTP. Mice were thought to only suffer from cell death in the substantia nigra (to a differing degree according to the strain of mice used) but do not show Parkinsonian symptoms; however, most of the recent studies indicate that MPTP can result in Parkinsonism-like syndromes in mice (especially chronic syndromes). It is believed that the lower levels of MAO-B in the rodent brain&#x27;s capillaries may be responsible for this.

==Discovery in users of illicit drugs==
The neurotoxicity of MPTP was hinted at in 1976 after Barry Kidston, a 23-year-old chemistry graduate student in Maryland, US, synthesized MPPP with MPTP as a major impurity and self-injected the result. Within three days he began exhibiting symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The National Institute of Mental Health found traces of MPTP and other pethidine analogs in his lab. They tested the substances on rats, but due to rodents&#x27; tolerance for this type of neurotoxin, nothing was observed. Kidston&#x27;s Parkinsonism was treated with levodopa but he died 18 months later from a cocaine overdose. Upon autopsy, Lewy bodies and destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were discovered.

In 1983, four people in Santa Clara County, California, US, were diagnosed with Parkinsonism after having used MPPP contaminated with MPTP, and as many as 120 were reported to have been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s symptoms. The neurologist J. William Langston in collaboration with NIH tracked down MPTP as the cause, and its effects on primates were researched. After performing neural grafts of fetal tissue on three of the patients at Lund University Hospital in Sweden, the motor symptoms of two of the three patients were successfully treated, and the third showed partial recovery.

Langston documented the case in his 1995 book &quot;The Case of the Frozen Addicts&quot;, which was later featured in two &quot;NOVA&quot; productions by PBS, re-aired in the UK on the BBC science series &quot;Horizon&quot;.

== Contribution of MPTP to research into Parkinson&#x27;s disease ==
Langston &quot;et al.&quot; (1984) found that injections of MPTP in squirrel monkeys resulted in Parkinsonism, symptoms of which were subsequently reduced by levodopa, the drug-of-choice in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease along with carbidopa and entacapone. The symptoms and brain structures of MPTP-induced Parkinson&#x27;s disease are fairly indistinguishable to the point that MPTP may be used to simulate the disease in order to study Parkinson&#x27;s disease physiology and possible treatments within the laboratory. Mouse studies have shown that susceptibility to MPTP increases with age.

Knowledge of MPTP and its use in reliably recreating Parkinson&#x27;s disease symptoms in experimental models has inspired scientists to investigate the possibilities of surgically replacing neuron loss through fetal tissue implants, subthalamic electrical stimulation and stem cell research, all of which have demonstrated initial provisional successes.

It has been postulated that Parkinson&#x27;s disease may be caused by minute amounts of MPP+-like compounds from ingestion or exogenously through repeated exposure and that these substances are too minute to be detected significantly by epidemiological studies.

In 2000, another animal model for Parkinson&#x27;s disease was found. It was shown that the pesticide and insecticide rotenone causes Parkinsonism in rats by killing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Like MPP+, rotenone also interferes with complex I of the electron transport chain.

==Synthesis and uses==
MPTP was first synthesized as a potential analgesic in 1947 by Ziering &quot;et al.&quot; by reaction of phenylmagnesium bromide with 1-methyl-4-piperidinone. It was tested as a treatment for various conditions, but the tests were halted when Parkinson-like symptoms were noticed in monkeys. In one test of the substance, two of six human subjects died.

MPTP is used in industry as a chemical intermediate; the chloride of the toxic metabolite MPP+, cyperquat, has been used as a herbicide. While cyperquat is not used anymore, the closely related substance paraquat is still being used as a herbicide in some countries.

==Analogues==
Analogues of MPTP include 2′-NH2-MPTP (2′-amino-MPTP) and 2′-CH3-MPTP (2′-methyl-MPTP).

The haloperidol-derived monoaminergic neurotoxins HPTP and HPP+ are structurally related to MPTP.

==In popular culture==
* In the novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, authored by William Gibson, MPTP is used as a means of inducing Parkinsonism in another character. 
* MPTP-induced Parkinson&#x27;s disease is featured in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Stiff.&quot;

* In Roger Williams&#x27; novel &quot;The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect&quot; the protagonist administers MPTP to the anti-heroine’s former nurse, who had stolen her painkillers in life, doing so as a means of neurodegenerative torture.

<doc id="544435" wikidata="Q3442064" url="?curid=544435" title="Rory Underwood">
<text>Rory Underwood, (born 19 June 1963) is an English former rugby union player. He is &#x27;s record international try scorer, with 49 tries in 85 internationals between 1984 and 1996. Underwood&#x27;s principal position was wing and he played 236 games for Leicester Tigers between 1983 and 1997, he also played for Middlesbrough, Bedford Blues and the Royal Air Force. Underwood toured with the British and Irish Lions in 1989 and 1993 playing in six tests and scoring one try. In 1992 Underwood played for England alongside his younger brother Tony Underwood, becoming the first brothers to play together for England since 1937.

Playing during the amateur era his profession was as a Royal Air Force pilot.

==Early life==
Underwood was born in Middlesbrough, England, of Chinese-English parentage. His father was a Yorkshire engineer who worked in Malaysia where he met and married Underwood&#x27;s Chinese-Malaysian mother.

Underwood was educated at Barnard Castle School (with fellow rugby international Rob Andrew), followed by initial officer training at RAF College Cranwell.

Underwood&#x27;s early life was spent in Malaysia. His family moved to Yorkshire in 1976, but his father was posted to Singapore and did not rejoin the family for another three years.

==Royal Air Force==
In the Royal Air Force (RAF), Underwood played for the Strike Command and main RAF rugby team. As flying officer he flew with No. 360 Squadron RAF, an electronic countermeasures training squadron, on Canberras at RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire. He then flew the Canberra TT18 with No. 100 Squadron RAF, also at Wyton.

Underwood took a ground-instruction job in 1995 at RAF Cranwell, becoming a flight lieutenant, while playing for Leicester. He became station flight safety officer, then joined No. 55 Squadron RAF (navigator training, now referred to as a weapon systems officer) on the twin-engined Dominie (British Aerospace 125), and continued in the RAF until 1999, although he could have stayed until 2001.

==Rugby==
Having first played as a youngster at Middlesbrough Rugby Club (with Rob Andrew and Bernie Coyne), Underwood went on to become one of the greatest wings in rugby union. Underwood is the leading try scorer for England in international matches. He first played for England in February 1984 against Ireland at Twickenham. He won 85 England and 6 Lions caps between 1984 and 1996 (then an English record, later surpassed by Jason Leonard – it remained the highest total for an English back, though that has since been overtaken by Jonny Wilkinson), scoring a record 49 tries for England, and 1 for the British Lions, making him one of the leading try scorers of all time. He played for England in the Rugby World Cups of 1987, 1991 and 1995.

Underwood was capable of playing on either right or left wing depending on who was selected on the opposite side. More usually seen on the left wearing shirt number 11, in 1988 he switched to the right (and shirt number 14) to accommodate Chris Oti: in 1990 on the right opposite Mark Bailey, but on the left when partnering Simon Halliday, continuing on the left in 1991 opposite Nigel Heslop: in the 1991 World Cup he played on the right in partnership with Oti early on, then on the left in partnership with Heslop until the quarter-final and Halliday for the final two rounds, an arrangement that persisted throughout the 1992 Five Nations championship – which was initially billed as his final season before retirement, Underwood scoring tries in each of the first three matches of the championship, and coming close to scoring against Wales. However, Underwood changed his mind and opted to carry on, initially for the next match against South Africa (their first match since their readmission to international sport), and eventually for several more years – playing mostly now on the left, to accommodate his younger brother, Tony, on the right wing. They were the first brothers to represent England at the same time since 1937: and, in the 1993 match against Scotland, the first pair of brothers to score tries in the same match for England. He has been described as one of the greatest wingers to ever play the game.

==Recent career==
Underwood has worked as a management consultant. When leaving the RAF he planned on setting up a company called Teamwork with his friend John Peters. He planned on acquiring a Commercial Pilot Licence.

Underwood set up UPH, a management and teamwork training company, with John Peters and Martyn Helliwell on 20 May 1999. Two years later, he appeared on Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank.

Like John Peters, Underwood is also a motivational speaker. He held a role as a non-executive director on the board of Leicester Tigers F.C, but left this role in November 2020. His new company is called Wingman Ltd.

==International tries==
==Personal life==
Underwood&#x27;s wife was an air traffic controller in the RAF. He has two daughters. He has two younger brothers, Gary and Tony, and also has a sister, Wendy. His brother Tony Underwood became a commercial pilot after retiring and also played rugby for England and has two daughters.

Underwood&#x27;s long-lasting relationship with the RAF was put under strain when his wife was unfairly dismissed from the RAF for being pregnant, for which she received an undisclosed sum after settling out of court in 1995.

Underwood lives in a small village near Grantham in Lincolnshire, having lived in the area for many years whilst at Cranwell. He has often been invited to be a local dignitary, or to play for local charity sports matches. He is President of the Grantham National Malaya and Borneo Veterans Association.

<doc id="544448" wikidata="Q612595" url="?curid=544448" title="Tintin and the Picaros">
<text>Tintin and the Picaros () is the twenty-third volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The final instalment in the series to be completed by Hergé, it was serialized in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from September 1975 to April 1976 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1976. The narrative follows the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus as they travel to the (fictional) South American nation of San Theodoros to rescue their friend Bianca Castafiore, who has been imprisoned by the government of General Tapioca. Once there, they become involved in the anti-government revolutionary activities of Tintin&#x27;s old friend General Alcazar.

Hergé began work on &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; eight years after completing the previous volume in the series, &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, creating it with the aid of his team of artists at Studios Hergé. The setting and plot was inspired by Hergé&#x27;s interest in Latin American revolutionaries, particularly those active in the Cuban Revolution. The book reflected changes to the appearance and behaviour of several key characters in the series; influenced by his design in the animated films &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot;, Tintin is depicted wearing bell-bottoms instead of his trademark plus fours.

The volume was published to a poor reception and has continued to receive negative reviews from later commentators on Hergé&#x27;s work. Early criticism of the story focused on what was seen as its pessimistic handling of its political themes, while later reviews concentrated on the poor characterisation and lack of energy. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot;, a story that he never completed, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for an episode of the 1991 animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; by Ellipse and Nelvana.

==Synopsis==

Tintin and his dog Snowy come to the home they share with their friends, Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus, at Marlinspike Hall. There, they learn that Bianca Castafiore, her maid Irma, pianist Igor Wagner and the detectives Thomson and Thompson have been imprisoned in San Theodoros for allegedly attempting to overthrow the military government of General Tapioca. Tapioca&#x27;s government have further alleged that the plot was masterminded by Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus themselves.

Tapioca invites the trio to visit San Theodoros, promising them safe passage, but Tintin deems it to be a trap, leaving Haddock and Calculus to go alone. Once there, the Captain and Professor are taken to a rural villa, where they are closely monitored by the security services.
Tintin joins his friends a few days later, where he points out to Haddock and Calculus that their villa is bugged. He recognises one of the staff as Pablo, a man who had saved his life in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;. From Pablo, Tintin learns that the entire scenario is a plot organised by Colonel Sponsz, a figure in the Bordurian military who is assisting Tapioca&#x27;s government in order to gain revenge against Tintin for the events of &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;.

With Pablo&#x27;s assistance, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus escape from their guards on a pyramid and seek refuge with General Alcazar and his small band of anti-Tapioca guerrillas, the Picaros, who are hiding in the South American jungle. After realising that Pablo is a double agent working for Tapioca, they escape an assault by a field gun and then shelter for a time with the Arumbaya, an indigenous community who live within the forest. Here, Tintin is reunited with his old acquaintance, the eccentric explorer Ridgewell, who is living with the Arumbaya. Leaving the Arumbaya settlement, they eventually arrive at the Picaros&#x27; encampment, where they meet Alcazar&#x27;s wife, Peggy.

However, Tapioca has been air-dropping loads of whiskey into the jungle to intoxicate the Picaros. Alcazar realises that the Picaros will fail to launch a successful coup against Tapioca while they remain drunkards, and to combat this problem, Calculus provides them with tablets which render the taste of alcohol disgusting. Soon afterward, Jolyon Wagg and his troupe of carnival performers, the &quot;Jolly Follies&quot;, arrive at the camp, having lost their way to Tapiocapolis where they mean to take part in the carnival. At Tintin&#x27;s suggestion, the Picaros disguise themselves in the Follies&#x27; costumes and enter Tapiocapolis during the carnival. There, they storm the presidential palace and seize control; Thomson and Thompson are rescued from a firing squad while Castafiore and her assistants are released from prison. Afterward, Alcazar becomes president, with Tapioca and Sponsz being exiled from the country as punishment for their crimes. Tintin, Snowy, Haddock and Calculus return home to Belgium.

==History==

===Background===
Hergé began &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; eight years after completing his previous &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot;, &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;. It would prove to be the only book that he completed during the final fifteen years of his life. He decided to develop the story around a group of Latin American revolutionaries, having had this idea since the early 1960s, prior to embarking on &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. In particular, he had been inspired by the activities of Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement when they were launching a guerrilla war from the Sierra Maestra during the Cuban Revolution against President Fulgencio Batista. Specifically, Hergé was interested in Castro&#x27;s statement that he would not cut his beard until the revolution had succeeded. Adopting this idea of the revolutionaries&#x27; facial hair, he initially planned to refer to Alcazar&#x27;s group as the Bigotudos, a reference to the Spanish word &quot;bigotudos&quot;, meaning &quot;moustached&quot;. As such, the story&#x27;s initial working title was &quot;Tintin et los Bigotudos&quot;, before Hergé later settled on &quot;Tintin et les Picaros&quot;.

Hergé&#x27;s depiction of a band of Latin American revolutionaries was also influenced by the French leftist activist Régis Debray&#x27;s accounts of his time spent fighting in the Bolivian Andes alongside the Argentine Marxist–Leninist revolutionary Che Guevara. Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Bordurian support for Tapioca&#x27;s government was a reference to the Soviet Union&#x27;s support for various Latin American regimes, most notably that of Castro&#x27;s Cuba, with San Theodoros being depicted as having been governed under the ideological system of Borduria&#x27;s political leader, Kurvi-Tasch. Similarly, Hergé included a reference to Alcazar being backed by the International Banana Company in order to reflect the influence of Western multinational corporations in Latin America.

Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the city of Tapiocapolis was visually based on the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. His depiction of a public sculpture in the city was inspired by the work of sculptor Marcel Arnould, while the paintings that he designed for the Tapiocapolis hotel in which Tintin and Haddock stay are based on the work of Serge Poliakoff.

Hergé incorporated many characters from previous &quot;Adventures&quot; into &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;; these include Pablo, Ridgewell, and the Arumbaya tribe from &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, as well as Colonel Sponz from &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;. The character of General Tapioca, who had been mentioned in previous &quot;Adventures&quot; but never depicted, was also introduced.
Hergé also introduced a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy as the daughter of arms dealer Basil Bazaroff – the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;. He also introduced the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the &quot;Turlupins&quot;, &quot;Turlurans&quot;, and &quot;Boutentrins&quot;.

For this &quot;Adventure&quot;, Hergé decided to update his depiction of Tintin&#x27;s clothes, having been influenced in doing so by the depiction of the character in the 1969 animated film &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot; and its 1972 sequel &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot;. As such, in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, the young reporter is depicted wearing a sheepskin flight jacket and open-faced helmet emblazoned with a CND symbol, while he also wears new bell-bottoms rather than the plus-fours that he had worn in previous instalments. Later commenting on the inclusion of the CND peace symbol, Hergé stated that for Tintin, &quot;That&#x27;s normal. Tintin is a pacifist, he was always anti-war.&quot; Hergé also changed the behaviour of several characters in the story, for instance by depicting Tintin practising yoga and Nestor the butler both eavesdropping and drinking Haddock&#x27;s whisky. Another new development that Hergé added to the story was Haddock&#x27;s first name, Archibald.

Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, &quot;Barelli&quot;. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé&#x27;s own birthday, 22 May.

===Publication===

&quot;Tintin et les Picaros&quot; began serialisation in both Belgium and France in &quot;Tintin-l&#x27;Hebdoptmiste&quot; magazine in September 1975. It was then published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1976. For this publication, a page was removed from the story so that it would fit the standard 62-page book format. The page in question was located between pages 22 and 23 of the published book, and featured Sponz attempting to smash a glass, but accidentally breaking a statue of Bordurian political leader Kurvi-Tasch instead. A launch party was held at the Hilton Hotel in Brussels.

Upon publication, it proved a commercial success with one and a half million copies soon sold.
It was nevertheless critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned what they deemed to be the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé&#x27;s depiction of regime change in San Theodoros does not bring about any improvement for the nation&#x27;s populace, with the critics from Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Hebdo 76&quot; and France&#x27;s &quot;Révolution&quot; thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, &quot;Tintin in the Picaros&quot; was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that &quot;The criticism that has been leveled at &quot;Picaros&quot; is astonishing. There is no talk of revolution; the people are in the favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see everywhere. You can give as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want.&quot; In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen&#x27;s launch of the story&#x27;s English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.

==Critical analysis==
Harry Thompson felt that Hergé&#x27;s use of various characters from earlier stories lent &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; &quot;the air of a finale&quot;. Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters felt that in this story, the characters were &quot;more passive than in the earlier adventures, submitting to events more than setting them off&quot;, with this being particularly evident for the character of Tintin. Michael Farr stated that &quot;Tintin has changed&quot;, as is evidenced by the change in his clothing, however he felt that &quot;such image modernising only succeeds in dating the adventure&quot;, adding that &quot;to alter Tintin&#x27;s appearance at the end of his career was not only superfluous but a mistake&quot;.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier stated that in this story, Alcazar was &quot;a deflated version of what he used to be&quot;, noting that by the end of the story he had become &quot;a prisoner in his own palace. A sad, yet somehow appropriate, ending&quot;. Farr suggested that the changes to the characters represented &quot;an element of dismantling of the characters and their traits&quot;, something that he believed had also been present in the previous two adventures, &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; and &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. In his psychoanalytical study of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès expressed the view that, as with &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; served as &quot;a kind of retrospective&quot; due to the return of various characters. He also suggested that the carnival revelers in San Theodoros evoked the figures from the previous stories: &quot;Scots, Africans, Chinese, Indians, cowboys, bullfighters, and, of course, the inevitable parrot&quot;. The Lofficiers saw the adventure as a partial sequel to &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, which was also set in San Theodoros and which contained many of the same characters.

Thompson considered &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; to be &quot;Hergé&#x27;s most overtly political book for many years&quot; but felt that, unlike Hergé&#x27;s earlier political works, &quot;no campaigning element&quot; is present. Peeters agreed, noting that &quot;Tintin in the Picaros&quot; is &quot;a far cry from the denunciation of a political system found in &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, and also from the almost militantly anti-Japanese tone of &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;.&quot; He thought that in this story, &quot;a sense of disillusionment has taken over&quot;, for it is &quot;quite clear that [Alcazar&#x27;s seizure of power] is no real revolution but a palace coup&quot;. Farr noted that this story showed that &quot;the idealist of 1930s is by 1970s a realist&quot;, in that while &quot;totalitarianism ... and the manipulation of the multinational concerns ... are still condemned ... Tintin accepts he can do little to change them&quot;.

The Lofficiers were ultimately highly critical of &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, awarding it two out of five, and describing it as &quot;just sad&quot;. Specifically, they felt that the &quot;undefinable magic of the Hergé line&quot; was &quot;sometimes missing&quot; from the story, believing that this had been caused by too much of the work having been turned over to his assistants in the Studios Hergé. Further, they felt that the &quot;characters seem tired: Tintin is totally reactive — even on the book cover, it is Haddock who takes the lead&quot;. Thompson echoed similar views, believing that &quot;life has not been breathed into the characters as normal&quot; and that there was &quot;something indefinable absent&quot; from the drawings, &quot;enjoyment, perhaps&quot;. He added that while it contained &quot;many fine vignettes&quot;, &quot;over all it is a lacklustre story, missing the sparkle of a genuine Tintin adventure&quot;. Peeters thought that &quot;the comedy here seems mechanical&quot; and &quot;neither the characters, nor the plot, nor the drawings ring true&quot;.

The literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; reflected a number of themes found throughout &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. For instance, he believed that the theme of eavesdropping was exhibited in the scene in which Nestor the butler listens in on Tintin and Haddock&#x27;s argument. He also expressed the view that Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus&#x27; imprisonment in their Los Dopicos hotel reflected the &quot;uneasy host–guest relationship&quot; theme.

McCarthy believed that the inclusion of the CND symbol on Tintin&#x27;s motorcycle helmet at the start of the story was a sign that Hergé&#x27;s left-wing tendency had won out over the right-wing perspectives which dominated his early work. He also placed emphasis on the fact that no executions were held during Alcazar&#x27;s revolution, adding that &quot;its blood ... will fail it: it will be anaemic&quot;, thus being a reference to Hergé&#x27;s anaemia. Further, he suggested that the loss of the ability to drink alcohol served as a symbolic castration.

Apostolidès expressed the view that many of the characters in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; could be divided into pairs. He considered Calculus and Alcazar to be one such pair, noting that they are &quot;both masters of power and control, the former in science and the latter in politics&quot;. He also placed Castafiore and Peggy together as a pair, noting that they each embody &quot;love, both maternal and romantic&quot;. Haddock and Wagg were also paired together, both being &quot;driven to succeed, but the former is happy with playing out his success in private life, whereas the latter tries to aggrandize himself everywhere&quot;. Finally, he paired together Ridgewell and Tintin, noting that while in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; they had a father-son style relationship, at this point they have become equals.

==Adaptations==
In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; was one of the stories included in the television series. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

<text>Kenneth Max Copeland (born December 6, 1936) is an American televangelist associated with the charismatic movement. He is the founder of Eagle Mountain International Church Inc. (EMIC), which is based in Tarrant County, Texas. Copeland has also written several books and other resources, and is known for his broadcast &quot;Believers Voice of Victory&quot;. 

Copeland preaches prosperity theology and is part of the Word of Faith movement, which teaches that divine favor is expressed in material and financial blessing, and that giving to ministries unlocks this favor.

==Life and career==
Kenneth Max Copeland was born on December 6, 1936, and raised in West Texas near a United States Army Air Forces airfield. This inspired him to become a pilot.

Copeland was a recording artist on the Imperial Records label, having one &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 hit, &quot;Pledge of Love&quot;, which charted in the Top 40 on April 20, 1957, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks, and peaked at No. 17.

In the fall of 1967, he enrolled in Oral Roberts University, where he soon became pilot and chauffeur to Oral Roberts.

==Kenneth Copeland Ministries==

In 1967, after attending Kenneth E. Hagin&#x27;s Pastor Seminars, Copeland and his wife Gloria founded Kenneth Copeland Ministries (KCM) in Fort Worth, Texas. The ministry&#x27;s motto is &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot;. Kenneth Copeland Ministries has six international offices in Canada, Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Ukraine. He preaches prosperity theology and is part of the Word of Faith movement, which teaches that financial blessing and physical well-being are the will of God for believers, and that material and financial success are a sign of divine favor. This may be unlocked through giving to ministry, and Copeland has written that parishioners will get a &quot;hundredfold&quot; return on their investment through &quot;giving to God&quot; by giving to his ministry.

Throughout several decades of ministry Kenneth Copeland has supported and partnered with other notable ministers of the Gospel. In 1986 Copeland supported and prayed over Reinhard Bonnke during Bonnke&#x27;s Fresh Fire Conference. Daniel Kolenda, who was the successor to Reinhard Bonnke, said that Kenneth Copeland told Bonnke that one day Bonnke would preach to a million people on one day. 

===Television and other programming===
Since 1967, Copeland&#x27;s ministry has held three-to-six-day conventions across the United States. KCM still holds an annual Southwest Believer&#x27;s Convention in his hometown of Fort Worth during the first week of August. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland also preach and minister at other conventions and conferences throughout the world. These events stream live on Copeland&#x27;s website, , as well as being shown on Christian television stations such as GOD TV and the Daystar Television Network. Portions of recorded conferences are shown on Sundays. The Monday through Friday television broadcasts feature a Copeland family member, either alone or with another minister, discussing subjects from the Bible.

On May 27, 1971, KCM began a one-hour television program called &quot;The Word of Faith&quot;. In 1972, another television program was launched called &quot;The Prayer Group&quot;. This was a half-hour television program aired across the United States. In 1989, the weekly show &quot;The Word of Faith&quot; was replaced by a daily series called &quot;Believer’s Voice of Victory&quot;.

Along with their television programming and television network, Kenneth Copeland has produced and starred in several films, including &quot;The Rally&quot; (2010), &quot;Superkid Academy: The Mission&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Rally-LA&quot; (2016).

===Victory Channel===
In 2015, KCM launched the Believer&#x27;s Voice of Victory Network on channel 265 on Dish Network. Believer&#x27;s Voice of Victory Network was renamed Victory Channel in 2019, and is available over-the-air and on some cable providers. On October 2, 2020, the Believer&#x27;s Voice of Victory (BVOV) stopped broadcasting on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). At the start of 2022, it was added on several national cable systems under a new channel lease with Olympusat, which had previously offered Hillsong Channel and Living Faith Network, then Bulldog Shopping Network, on the channel space. 

The Victory Channel&#x27;s popular &quot;FlashPoint&quot; current-events prophecy program is hosted by pastor Gene Bailey and reaches approximately 11,000 households. &quot;FlashPoint&quot; commonly features nationally known ministry leaders such as Lance Wallnau and Hank Kunneman; other guests have included Donald Trump, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor Greene and former Ambassador to Israel David Friedman.

===Facilities and aircraft===
Kenneth Copeland Ministries is located in Fort Worth, Texas, on a property that was once Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake (MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake), a United States Marine Corps air base, valued in 2008 at $554,160 () by Tarrant Appraisal District. The site includes the Eagle Mountain International Church, television and radio production facilities, warehouse and distribution facilities, residences for the Copeland family, and Kenneth Copeland Airport. As of 2024, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records indicated that no aircraft were based at the airport, and that it had a single usable runway; that same year, KCM told the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; that it was raising money to resurface the second runway so it could be used again, and it was using the former Marine Corps hospital building as a medical clinic for church members. In 2008, approximately 500 people were employed by KCM. Copeland&#x27;s son John Copeland was the ministry&#x27;s chief operating officer until his divorce from Marty Copeland in 2018. He remains a consultant to the ministry.

KCM owns several business jets, including a 1998 Cessna 550 Citation Bravo, which it received from a donor in October 2007 and is used for domestic flights, and a 2005 Cessna 750 Citation X, which it uses for international flights. In 2018, KCM acquired a Gulfstream V that was formerly owned by Tyler Perry, and was restoring a 1962 Beech H-18 Twin, which the ministry plans to use for disaster relief efforts.

===Kenneth Copeland Bible College===
Kenneth Copeland Bible College (KCBC) is located on the property of Kenneth Copeland Ministries and Eagle Mountain International Church (EMIC). KCBC is an accredited member with Transworld Accrediting Commission International. On August 28, 2003, Kenneth Copeland Bible College opened an extension campus in Langley, British Columbia.

=== Israel ===
For several decades Copeland and KCM has been a public and vocal supporter for Israel. On August 17, 2022 the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, called and personally thanked Copeland and KCM for their support of Ukrainian and Russian Jews. In 2020 he was listed by the Israel Allies Foundation as one of the top supporters of Israel along with Paula White, John Hagee, Mike Huckabee, and other Christian leaders. Copeland and other Christian leaders such as Greg Laurie and John Hagee have received criticism for their support of Israel.

==Personal life==
Copeland has been married three times. His first marriage was to Ivy Bodiford in October 1955. They had one child, and divorced in 1958. He was then married to Cynthia Davis from 1958 to 1961.

Copeland married Gloria (née Neece) in 1963. They are the parents of John Copeland and Kellie Copeland. Gloria co-hosts the ministry&#x27;s flagship broadcast, &quot;The Believer&#x27;s Voice of Victory&quot;, alongside her husband.

Kellie preaches throughout the United States, as does Copeland&#x27;s daughter Terri, who also preaches at Eagle Mountain International Church, which is pastored by her husband George Pearsons.

Copeland has amassed significant wealth during his career and has referred to himself as a &quot;very wealthy man&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; referred to him as the wealthiest pastor in America, allegedly having a net worth of $750 million in 2021. As of 2024, Copeland&#x27;s net worth was estimated to be $300 million.

===Donald Trump advisory board===
Copeland sat on the evangelical executive advisory board that Donald Trump assembled during his campaign for the presidency. Appointment to the board did not require endorsement of his bid for presidency, and Copeland clarified that he did not endorse Trump at the time. Before the 2016 election, Copeland said that Christians who did not vote for Trump would be guilty of murder, referring to the pro-choice stance of Hillary Clinton. After a state dinner at the White House that Copeland attended, he stated in an interview that Trump was &quot;led by the Spirit of God&quot;, and that his most important legacy as president would be the appointments of conservative judges. 

On November 5, 2022, Copeland spoke at a Donald Trump rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, stating that Trump is the only president he has ever seen wear the red, white, and blue in office. During the 2024 Southwest Believers&#x27; Convention in Fort Worth, Texas, Copeland told the thousands in attendance and online that voting is a sacred trust. His involvement in politics as a nationally prominent ministry leader has drawn both praise and criticism.

== Controversy ==

KCM has been criticized for its use of private aircraft. KCM promised from 2006 to 2010 to create an aviation relief assistance program called &quot;Angel Flight 44&quot;, to help Haiti. A spokesperson responded &quot;This was not a specific promise with a timeline attached&quot;, and said that the money was spent on airplane repairs. In 2008, the ministry owned five airplanes and continued to purchase more. In February 2007, Copeland was accused of using KCM&#x27;s Citation X for personal vacations. The Copelands&#x27; financial records and a list of KCM&#x27;s board of directors are not publicly available; the information is held in confidence by the Internal Revenue Service. Responding to media questions, Copeland pointed to an accounting firm&#x27;s declaration that his jet travel complied with federal tax laws. 

In December 2008, KCM&#x27;s Citation Bravo was denied tax exemption after KCM refused to submit a standardized Texas Comptroller form that some county appraisal districts use to make determinations, which would have required making public the salary of all ministry staff. KCM subsequently filed suit with the Tarrant Appraisal District in January 2009 and its petition to have the aircraft&#x27;s tax-exempt status restored was granted in March 2010.

KCM has utilized an FAA program that blocks enrolled aircraft on flight tracking websites; in 2010, the flights of five of the ministry&#x27;s aircraft were kept private, including the Citation X and a North American T-28 Trojan. United States Senator Chuck Grassley has questioned some of the flights taken by these aircraft, including layovers in Maui, Fiji, and Honolulu. The ministries say that the stopovers were for preaching or for allowing pilot rest.

Copeland raised funds for the building of a hangar, upgrading of the runway, and maintenance. Copeland&#x27;s and other televangelists&#x27; use of private jets, luxury cars and lavish houses has been widely criticized. In 2015, Copeland, in a broadcast alongside fellow televangelist Jesse Duplantis, defended the use of private jets as a necessary part of their ministry.

Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential primary candidate who made six appearances on Copeland&#x27;s program &quot;Believer&#x27;s Voice of Victory&quot; rented KCM&#x27;s facilities for a fundraiser, which was criticized by the Trinity Foundation. As a result of the Huckabee appearances, KCM was one of six ministries investigated in the United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. KCM was one of four that did not co-operate or volunteer to make reforms. The investigation did not conclude the Copelands had done anything wrong.

In 2013, a measles outbreak with 25 confirmed cases in Tarrant County was attributed in the press to anti-vaccination sentiments expressed by members of the Copeland Ministries. The church denied making any such statements and urged members to get vaccinations, even offering free immunizations through the church itself. Pastor Terri Copeland Pearsons, who is Kenneth Copeland&#x27;s daughter, offered free vaccination clinics and advised those who did not attend one of the clinics to quarantine themselves at home for two weeks. In a statement on the church website, Pearsons said she was not against immunizations, but also raised concerns about them.

Copeland and his wife were featured in a 2015 episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;. John Oliver criticized the Copelands for using tax laws to live in a $6.3 million mansion as the parsonage allowance for their home is not subject to income taxes, for using church donations to buy a $20 million jet that was used for trips to a ski resort and a private game ranch, and for promotion of healing through faith and skepticism of medicine.

In May 2019, he received criticism for his lavish lifestyle after &quot;Inside Edition&quot; released an interview where he defended his purchase of a private jet. He stated &quot;If I flew commercial, I&#x27;d have to stop 65% of what I&#x27;m doing&quot; and he additionally defended a previous comment where he said that he did not fly commercial because he likened it to flying with demons.

Copeland had drawn criticism for his comments on the Joe Biden presidency. He also gained attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing pastors should not cancel services, and repeatedly saying the pandemic had ended or would end soon. On March 29, 2020, in a televised sermon, Copeland &quot;executed judgment&quot; on COVID-19. He claimed that it was &quot;finished&quot; and &quot;over&quot; and that the US was now &quot;healed and well again&quot;. In another sermon shortly thereafter, he claimed to destroy the virus with the &quot;wind of God&quot;. He urged followers to continue to give tithes to his ministry even if they had lost their jobs through economic hardship brought about by the pandemic.

On August 3–8, 2020, the Kenneth Copeland Ministries hosted the Southwest Believers&#x27; Conference at the Fort Worth Convention Center in Fort Worth, Texas, despite restrictions on social gatherings to limit the spread of the pandemic. Local leaders criticized the event, attended by hundreds of people, but were unable to enforce public health restrictions because religious gatherings were exempt under Governor Greg Abbott&#x27;s executive orders.

<doc id="544458" wikidata="Q6194819" url="?curid=544458" title="Jim Edwards (Canadian politician)">
<text>James Stewart Edwards (born August 31, 1936) is a former Canadian politician from Alberta.

==Early life==
James Stewart Edwards was born on August 31, 1936, in Edmonton, Alberta to Donald Stewart Edwards and Verna May Armstrong. Edwards attended the University of Alberta attaining a Bachelor of Arts. He married Sheila Mary Mooney on September 10, 1960, and had four children together. Edwards served as the Commissioner of the Alberta Human Rights Commissioner from 1979 to 1980.

==Political career==

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1984 general election as a Progressive Conservative (PC) from Alberta. He served as a parliamentary secretary to several ministers in the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

Following Mulroney&#x27;s resignation as PC leader and prime minister in 1993, Edwards was a candidate at the PC leadership convention held to choose a successor. He placed third. Edwards ran on a platform of cutting federal spending by $10 billion per year until the deficit and national debt were wiped out, reducing the size of Cabinet from 35 to 20, reviewing defence spending, freezing support to the European Bank for Renewal and Development, privatizing all Crown Corporations including Canada Post, and reducing international funding.

He was appointed chief government Whip and President of the Treasury Board in the short-lived cabinet of Prime Minister Kim Campbell. He lost his seat in that year&#x27;s 1993 election that reduced the Tories to only two members of Parliament in the House.

==Later life==

Edwards was the president and CEO of Economic Development Edmonton from 1998 to 2002 and served as the chair of the board of governors at the University of Alberta from March 2002 to 2006. Edwards received an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Alberta in 2006.

<doc id="544459" wikidata="Q6016486" url="?curid=544459" title="Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland">
<text>The Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland was established in 1998 as part of the Belfast Agreement, intended as a major step in the Northern Ireland peace process. Chaired by Conservative politician and the last Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten (later the Lord Patten of Barnes), it was better known as the Patten Commission and it produced a report in 1999 known as the Patten Report. The other members of the Commission were Maurice Hayes, Peter Smith, Kathleen O&#x27;Toole, Gerald W. Lynch, Sir John Smith, Lucy Woods and Professor Clifford Shearing. The Secretary to the Commission was Bob Peirce, who drafted the report.

==Terms of reference==
Under the terms of reference defined in the Belfast Agreement, the Commission was to inquire into policing in Northern Ireland, consult widely, and make proposals for future policing structures and arrangements, including the police force composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos and symbols.

The aim of the proposals was to create a police service that would be effective, operate in partnership with the community, cooperate with the Garda Síochána and other police forces, and be accountable both to the law and the community which it was to serve.

==Report==
On 9 September 1999 the Commission produced its report, entitled &quot;A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland&quot; popularly known as the &quot;Patten Report&quot;, which contained 175 symbolic and practical recommendations. Key recommendations included:
* renaming the Royal Ulster Constabulary the Police Service of Northern Ireland;
* a new Policing Board and District Policing Partnership Boards to ensure accountability;
* creation of a Police Ombudsman and a Complaints Tribunal;
* removal of most visible symbols of Britishness from the police service;
* a 50-50 recruitment policy for Catholics and Protestants;
* a new code of ethics and oath of office, including a strong emphasis on human rights;
* an emphasis on community policing and normalisation;
* proposals for training, community liaison, cooperation with other police services, and recruitment from outside Northern Ireland; and
* repeal by the Gaelic Athletic Association of its Rule 21, which prohibited members of the police or Army in Northern Ireland from being members of the Association.

==Effect==
The recommendations contained in the report have been partly implemented by the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 and the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003. Sinn Féin, which represents a quarter of Northern Ireland&#x27;s voters, refused to endorse the new force until the Patten recommendations had been implemented in full, however voted to support the force in 2007 and now take their seats on the Northern Ireland Policing Board. The recommendation to change the RUC name to Northern Ireland Police Service was changed to Police Service of Northern Ireland instead. A Gaelic Athletic Association convention repealed Rule 21 (a ban on members of the British army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary from playing Gaelic games), although almost all of the votes to do so came from the Republic (there were exceptions Kerry, Cavan and Monaghan voted against repealing the rule) . Of the six associations in Northern Ireland, only County Down voted to repeal it.

== Affirmative action measures ==
Affirmative action in Northern Ireland denotes proactive measures seeking to redress inequalities experienced by a particular group. The Equalities Review defines the goal of equality in a democratic society as: ‘An equal society [which] protects and promotes equal, real freedom and … removes the barriers that limit what people can do and can be.’ The backdrop to affirmative action in Northern Ireland (NI) was, &quot;[t]hirty years of internal war [which] intensified already deeply etched fissures and suspicions&quot; between the Roman Catholic and Protestant communities. The recognition of the dominance of the two populace lead to proactive measures in anti-discrimination legislation.

== Context ==

===Policing in Northern Ireland===
Traces of proactive equality measures can be traced back to the Fair Employment Act (NI) 1976. This legislation recognised the importance of equality in the workplace between Protestant and Roman Catholic communities. With the 1989 Amendment imposing positive duties on employers to prevent discrimination. Such actions have led to the NI approach of addressing inequality of opportunity to be considered as &quot;radically different&quot; to the rest of the United Kingdom (UK).

The Good Friday Agreement 1998 provided the agenda of creating a &quot;new beginning to policing [in] Northern Ireland, with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole.&quot; The Cameron Report identified that incidents of misconduct in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), such as the widely televised unrest erupting from the Civil Rights March on 5 October 1968, added weight its public perception as a Protestant organisation. The NI Affairs Committee noted that ‘whether criticism of the force has been justified or not, it is the case that any settlement in Northern Ireland involves policing issues’.

Whilst the RUC had an affirmative action programme in place, this was largely ineffective. A reflection of the data demonstrates the Roman Catholic representation of the police force to increase from 7.4% in 1991 to a mere 8.2% seven years later.

===Patten Report===

A post conflict solution arising from the Independent Commission on Policing, led by Chris Patten, included proposals for more inclusive policing arrangements. The aim was to create a police force more representative of the society it serves. The immediate rebranding of policing to the &quot;PSNI&quot; (Police Service of Northern Ireland) sought to overcome the backdrop of discrimination that had become synonymous with the former institution. The report was a comprehensive plan including proactive measures regarding gender equality, community awareness training and changing the culture and ethos of the police.

A key focus was placed on the 50:50 recruitment measure, which proposed that ‘an equal number of Protestant and Catholics would be drawn from the pool of qualified candidates.’

The pursuit of a more proportional representation was critical in adopting this temporary measure (See table, fig 12) in addition to the certainty of results it was likely to produce within a reasonable timeframe. A broader reading of the contemporary political context in NI implicates the measure with the long term goal of achieving peace within NI. The Patten Report noted the findings from the, &quot;Community Attitudes Survey which found that over three quarters of all Catholics thought there were too few Catholics represented and over 60% of all Protestants agreed.&quot; The Report also recognised that for effective policing in a democracy, it must be based on consent across the community. It was particularly important to restore the police’s legitimacy and public confidence.

Whilst the Patten proposals were largely accepted by the Secretary of State, the temporary 50:50 recruitment measure was not universally welcomed. In particular, the measure was not welcomed by Unionist political parties. The temporary 50:50 recruitment measure came into effect by the enactment of the Police (NI) Act 2000.

== Evaluation ==

=== Academic commentary ===
Advocates of such measures, such as Sandra Fredman point to a number of advantages and justifications for supporting affirmative action. Fredman argues that affirmative action programmes can lead to greater integration of minorities within the community which can, in turn, help to reduce inequalities. These improvements help to reverse the negative effects of past discrimination. However, Fredman also recognises the ability of affirmative action to change inequality in the future. One benefit she notes is the creation of role models for other individuals within the traditionally disadvantaged community. This can pave the way for a change in attitude and thus predicate institutional change.

The &quot;merit principle&quot; has long been an important term in determining the appropriate scope of affirmative action. As Son Hing, Bobocel and Zanna note, typically people who strongly endorse the merit principle and believe that outcomes should be given to those most deserving, oppose affirmative action programmes that violate this principle. Sally Wokes highlights that affirmative action violates the essential principle of equality, suggesting that it is likely to increase tensions between communities and lead to the stigmatisation of those groups which benefit. She also questions the validity of the ‘role model’ argument on the basis that the perceived lack of merit undermines the legitimacy of their position, thus negating their positive influence as a role model. Furthermore, Wokes suggests that affirmative action will only benefit the least deprived members of a minority, therefore doing little to tackle the underlying disadvantage.

===Impact on Northern Ireland policing===
In December 1998, the Catholic proportion of the police service represented 8.3% this had significantly increased by March 2011 to 29.7%. Owen Paterson viewed this result as a ‘tremendous change’ which was at the top end of the Patten Report’s critical mass. In August 2014, the Catholic proportion had increased to 30.75%.

Catholic confidence in the PSNI has continued to increase. In December 2006, 79% had some level of confidence in the PSNI, as compared to 75% in September 2005. This is broadly similar to Protestant confidence levels which have remained static at 80%. However, critics point to questions around falling levels of public confidence in some loyalist and republican communities.

Nevertheless, the discriminatory impact on other communities, specifically Protestant, has been acknowledged against this context of increasing Catholic representation and support for the police. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for NI, Ian Pearson, stated that &quot;our figures on discrimination against the Protestant community by the policy show that, to date 440 people have been discriminated against&quot;.

Furthermore, Patrick Yu (Executive Director of the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities) criticises the 50:50 measure, for categorising Catholics and ‘non-Catholics,’ highlighting that the legislation addresses only two communities, with all other minorities, ’fall(ing) through the gap.’ It is however noted that by August 2014, ethnic minorities employed as police officers stood at 0.51% of the population, which is broadly in line with census data.

Policing in NI continues to evolve and its effectiveness will be subject to ongoing review and evaluation by the Policing Board. A Public Accounts Committee report stated almost 40% of all temporary workers were former police officers and nearly 20% of Patten retirees were reemployed by the PSNI as temporary staff. This has provoked criticism that the results produced by the Patten recommendations are somewhat superficial.

Given the close alignment between the political context and policing, the affirmative action measures and their effectiveness will constantly be subject to review and evaluation. It is possible that the compositional improvements of the PSNI may have influenced the Metropolitan Police in London to call for positive action measures to increase the representation of ethnic minorities.

<doc id="544460" wikidata="Q1198555" url="?curid=544460" title="Unweaving the Rainbow">
<text>Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder is a 1998 book by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, in which the author discusses the relationship between science and the arts from the perspective of a scientist.

Dawkins addresses the misperception that science and art are at odds. Driven by the responses to his books &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; and &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; wherein readers resented his naturalistic world view, seeing it as depriving life of meaning, Dawkins felt the need to explain that, as a scientist, he saw the world as full of wonders and a source of pleasure. This pleasure was not in spite of, but rather because he does not assume as cause the inexplicable actions of a deity but rather the understandable laws of nature.

His starting point is John Keats&#x27;s well-known, light-hearted accusation that Isaac Newton destroyed the poetry of the rainbow by &#x27;reducing it to the prismatic colours.&#x27; See Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;Lamia&quot; and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;To Science&quot;. Dawkins&#x27;s agenda is to show the reader that science does not destroy, but rather discovers poetry in the patterns of nature.

==Summary==

===Preface===
It is of little concern whether or not science can prove that the ultimate fate of the cosmos lacks purpose: we live our lives regardless at a &quot;human&quot; level, according to ambitions and perceptions which come more naturally. Therefore, science should not be feared as a sort of cosmological wet blanket. In fact, those in search of beauty or poetry in their cosmology need not turn to the paranormal or even necessarily restrict themselves to the mysterious: science itself, the business of unravelling mysteries, is beautiful and poetic. (The rest of the preface sketches an outline of the book, makes acknowledgements, etc.)

===The anaesthetic of familiarity===

====Opening lines====
&quot;We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, greater scientists than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?&quot;

====Summary====
The first chapter describes several ways in which the universe appears beautiful and poetic when viewed scientifically. However, it first introduces an additional reason to embrace science. Time and space are vast, so the probability that the reader came to be alive here and now, as opposed to another time or place, was slim. More important, the probability that the reader came to be alive at all were even slimmer: the correct structure of atoms had to align in the universe.
Given how special these circumstances are, the &quot;noble&quot; thing to do is employ the allotted several decades of human life towards understanding that universe. Rather than simply feeling connected with nature, one should rise above this &quot;anaesthetic of familiarity&quot; and &quot;observe&quot; the universe scientifically.

===Drawing room of dukes===
This chapter describes a third reason to embrace science (the first two being beauty and duty): improving one&#x27;s performance in the arts. Science is often presented publicly in a translated format, &quot;dumbed down&quot; to fit the language and existing ideas of non-scientists. This offers a disservice to the public, who are capable of appreciating the beauty of the universe as deeply as a scientist can. The successful communication of unadulterated science enhances, not confuses, the arts; after all, poets (Dawkins&#x27;s synonym for artists—see page 24) and scientists are motivated by a similar spirit of wonder. We should therefore battle the stereotype that science is difficult, uncool, and not useful for the common person.

===Barcodes in the stars===
Studying a phenomenon, such as a flower, cannot detract from its beauty.
First, some scientists, such as Feynman, are able to appreciate the aesthetics of the flower while engaged in their study. Second, the mysteries which science unfolds lead to new and more exciting mysteries; for example, botany&#x27;s findings might lead us to wonder about the workings of a fly&#x27;s consciousness.
This effect of multiplying mysteries should satisfy even those who think that scientific understanding is at odds with aesthetics, e.g. people who agree with Einstein that &quot;the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious&quot;.
(For evidence, the rest of this chapter discusses the fascinating science and beautiful new mysteries which followed in the wake of Newton&#x27;s &quot;unweaving&quot; of the rainbow, e.g. his explanation of the prismatic effects of moist air.)

===Barcodes on the air===
This chapter offers more evidence that science is fun and poetic, by exploring sound waves, birdsong, and low-frequency phenomena such as pendula and periodic mass extinctions.

===Barcodes at the bar===
A fourth reason to embrace science is that it can help deliver justice in a court of law, via DNA fingerprinting or even via simple statistical reasoning.
Everyone should learn the scientist&#x27;s art of probability assessment, to make better decisions.

===Hoodwink&#x27;d with faery fancy===
This chapter explores what Dawkins considers to be fallacies in astrology, religion, magic, and extraterrestrial visitations. Credulity and Hume&#x27;s criterion are also discussed.

===Unweaving the uncanny===
Amazing coincidences are much more common than we may think, and sometimes, when over-interpreted, they lead to faulty conclusions. Statistical significance tests can help determine which patterns are meaningful.

===Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance===
Unlike &quot;magisterial poetry&quot; (where metaphors and pretty language are used to describe the familiar), &quot;pupillary poetry&quot; uses poetic imagery to assist a scientist&#x27;s thinking about the exotic (e.g. consider &quot;being&quot; an electron temporarily). Although it is useful, some authors take pupillary poetry too far, and, &quot;drunk on metaphor&quot;, they produce &quot;bad science&quot;; i.e. postulate faulty theories. This is powered by humanity&#x27;s natural tendency to look for representations.

===The selfish cooperator===
Genes compete with each other, but this occurs within the context of collaboration, as is shown with examples involving mitochondria, bacteria, and termites. Two types of collaboration are co-adaptation (tailoring simultaneously the different parts of an organism, such as flower colour and flower markings), and co-evolution (two species changing together; e.g. predator and prey running speeds may increase together in a sort of arms race).

===The Genetic Book of the Dead===
The body of any organism provides clues about its habitat. The genes allow one to reconstruct a picture of the range of ways of life that the species has experienced; in this sense DNA would act as a palimpsestic &quot;digital archive&quot; if only its language of encoding history could be fully understood. Finally, the curious genetics of cuckoos is discussed.

===Reweaving the world===
The brain is akin to a powerful computer, which creates a sort of virtual reality to model economically the environment. Neural circuitry is discussed, and a comparison is made between brains and genes: albeit over different time scales, both record the environment&#x27;s past to help the organism make the optimal actions in the (predicted) future.

===The balloon of the mind===
The simultaneous explosions in hardware and software of the 20th century are together an example of what Dawkins calls &quot;self-feeding co-evolution&quot;.
A similar event occurred over a longer time scale (millions of years) when the minds and brains of our ancestors simultaneously improved very rapidly. Five possible triggers of this improvement were: language, map reading, ballistics, memes, and metaphors/analogies.

====Conclusion====
The final two paragraphs of &quot;The balloon of the mind&quot; conclude by saying that human beings are the only animal with a sense of purpose in life, and that that purpose should be to construct a comprehensive model of how the universe works.

==Petwhac==

The book coins the acronymical term, petwhac, short for &quot;Population of Events That Would Have Appeared Coincidental&quot;. Dawkins suggests that when one encounters an extremely unlikely coincidence, it should be considered in the broader context of other, similar events which would &quot;also&quot; have seemed coincidental.

An example would be a person on a foreign holiday encountering a friend they had not seen for years. In isolation this may feel like an impossible coincidence, but considering the wider petwhac (meeting any friend from around the same period, or meeting an acquaintance, or not meeting them but being told weeks later that they had been in the same city at that time) the true odds are more likely. In short, the bigger the petwhac, the stronger case you have to avoid ascribing something to fate or coincidence.

Dawkins offers several examples of petwhacs in the book, two of which are the bedside clock of a woman (Richard Feynman&#x27;s wife) stopping exactly when she died, and a psychic who stops the watches of his television audience.

The first is explained by the fact that the clock had a mechanical defect which made it stop when tilted off the horizontal, which is what a nurse did to read the time of death in poor lighting conditions. The matter of the watches, in Dawkins&#x27;s own words, is explained thus —

If somebody&#x27;s watch stopped three weeks after the spell was cast, even the most credulous would prefer to put it down to chance. We need to decide how large a delay would have been judged by the audience as sufficiently simultaneous with the psychic&#x27;s announcement to impress. About five minutes is certainly safe, especially since he can keep talking to each caller for a few minutes before the next call ceases to seem roughly simultaneous. There are about 100,000 five-minute periods in a year. The probability that any given watch, say mine, will stop in a designated five-minute period is about 1 in 100,000. Low odds, but there are 10 million people watching the show. If only half of them are wearing watches, we could expect about 25 of those watches to stop in any given minute. If only a quarter of these ring into the studio, that is 6 calls, more than enough to dumbfound a naïve audience. Especially when you add in the calls from people whose watches stopped the day before, people whose watches didn&#x27;t stop but whose grandfather clocks did, people who died of heart attacks and their bereaved relatives phoned in to say that their &#x27;ticker&#x27; gave out, and so on.

<doc id="544461" wikidata="Q434814" url="?curid=544461" title="Lillian Disney">
<text>Lillian Marie Disney ( Bounds; February 15, 1899December 16, 1997) was an American ink artist at the Walt Disney Animation Studios and the wife of Walt Disney from 1925 until his death in 1966. Born in Spalding, Idaho, Disney graduated from high school in Lapwai before moving to Lewiston to attend college. She left Idaho in 1923 to move to southern California, where she met future husband Walt while working as a secretary for his company.

During a train ride in 1928, Walt revealed to his wife a new animated character, whom he called &quot;Mortimer Mouse&quot;. Lillian suggested that he rename his character &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, a name which has since become synonymous with the Disney brand.

Walt Disney died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966, after which Lillian remarried, to John L. Truyens (a Southern California real estate developer) from 1969 until his death in 1981. On December 15, 1997, Lillian Disney suffered a stroke and died the following morning in Los Angeles at age 98.

== Early years ==
Born Lillian Marie Bounds in Spalding, Idaho, she grew up in nearby Lapwai on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, where her father Willard worked as a blacksmith and federal marshal. She was the youngest of ten children, and the family struggled financially; her father died when she was seventeen. After graduation from Lapwai High School, Bounds and her mother moved down to Lewiston; she attended a year of business college then moved to southern California in 1923 to live with her sister She was working at the Disney Studio in &quot;ink and paint&quot; as a secretary when she met Walt.

== Marriage to Walt Disney ==
Lillian Bounds and Walt Disney married on July 13, 1925, in Idaho at her brother&#x27;s home. The wedding was officiated by the rector of Lewiston&#x27;s Episcopal Church of the Nativity. Walt Disney&#x27;s parents did not attend. As Bounds&#x27;s father was deceased, her uncle, who was chief of the Lewiston Fire Department, gave the bride away. She wore a dress that she had made herself. The couple had two daughters, Diane Marie Disney and Sharon Mae Disney the latter of whom was adopted. Disney had ten grandchildren: seven by Diane and her husband (Ron W. Miller), and three by Sharon and her two husbands, Robert Brown and William Lund.

== Recognition ==

Her film career includes work as an ink artist on the film &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;. Disney is credited with having named her husband&#x27;s most famous character, Mickey Mouse, during a train trip from New York to California in 1928. Walt showed a drawing of the cartoon mouse to his wife and told her that he was going to name it &quot;Mortimer Mouse&quot;. Lillian replied that the name sounded &quot;too depressing&quot; and she was very proud to have suggested the name &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; instead of Mortimer.

At the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, Walt Disney named his 1:8-scale live steam locomotive the &quot;Lilly Belle&quot; in his wife&#x27;s honor. Additionally, the parlor car of the Disneyland Railroad was named the &quot;Lilly Belle&quot; in her honor, and the Walt Disney World Railroad has a locomotive named &quot;Lilly Belle&quot;, where each locomotive is named for someone who greatly contributed to the Walt Disney Company. Walt Disney Imagineering created &quot;The Empress Lilly&quot;, a paddle steamer replica, at Walt Disney World in Disney Springs and Disney christened it on May 1, 1977. Disney was inducted into the Disney Legends in 2003.

== Later years and death ==
Walt Disney died of lung cancer on December 15, 1966, at the age of 65. Lillian was later remarried John L. Truyens in May 1969 until his death on February 24, 1981, at the age of 73.

In 1987, she pledged a $50 million gift towards the construction of a new concert hall in Los Angeles. After several delays, the Walt Disney Concert Hall opened in 2003, six years after her death. She also helped fund the founding of The California Institute of the Arts. In 1996, she donated $100,000 to the Nez Perce indigenous people in support of buying back tribal artifacts.

In response to a controversial biography, Lillian made a rare public statement about her marriage with Walt, &quot;We shared a wonderful, exciting life, and we loved every minute of it. He was a wonderful husband to me, and wonderful and joyful father and grandfather.&quot;

Lillian Disney suffered a stroke on December 15, 1997, exactly 31 years after Walt&#x27;s death. She died the following morning at her home in West Los Angeles at the age of 98. She was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California alongside her first husband, Walt Disney.

<text>William Woodbridge (August 20, 1780October 20, 1861) was a U.S. statesman in the states of Ohio and Michigan and in the Michigan Territory prior to statehood. He served as the second governor of Michigan and a United States senator from Michigan.

==Early life in Connecticut and politics in Ohio==
Woodbridge was born in Norwich, Connecticut. Through an entirely paternal line he was a direct descendant of English Puritan John Woodbridge. As a child moved with his family to Marietta, Ohio, in about 1790. He began the study of law in Marietta and developed a close friendship with Lewis Cass. He returned to Connecticut to complete his law studies, and after returning to Ohio, was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1806 where he began a practice in Marietta, Ohio. In June 1806, he married Juliana Trumbull, the daughter of John Trumbull.

He was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1807, and was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1808, serving from 1809 to 1814. He was also the prosecuting attorney for New London (now Washington County, Ohio) from 1808 to 1814.

==Politics in Michigan Territory==
In 1814, Woodbridge&#x27;s old friend Lewis Cass, who had become Governor of the Michigan Territory, encouraged him to accept appointments as Secretary of the Territory and as the collector of customs at the Port of Detroit. On October 15, 1814, Woodbridge reluctantly accepted the appointments from President James Madison and moved to Detroit, Michigan. During the frequent absences of Cass, Woodbridge served as acting governor. In 1817, Woodbridge became a trustee of the University of Michigan.

Under the rules of territorial government, the territory did not have representation in the U.S. Congress. Woodbridge influenced Congress to pass legislation authorizing the selection of a non-voting delegate to Congress. Woodbridge became the Michigan Territory&#x27;s first delegate, serving in the 16th Congress from March 4, 1819, to his resignation on August 9, 1820, due to illness in his family. Solomon Sibley succeeded Woodbridge as delegate. He remained the Territorial Secretary while delegate.

As a delegate, Woodbridge worked for the passage of legislation that recognized old French land titles in the territory according to the terms of the previously signed treaties. He also secured approval for the construction of government roads from the Great Miami River to Detroit, and from Detroit to Chicago. He was also a strong advocate for Michigan&#x27;s claim to the Toledo Strip, which was disputed with the state of Ohio.

In 1828, he was appointed one of three Territorial Supreme Court justice by President John Quincy Adams, succeeding James Witherell and serving in this capacity until 1832 when his term expired and President Andrew Jackson chose a replacement who was not from the Whig Party as Woodbridge was.

==Politics and Governorship in the State of Michigan==
Woodbridge was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1835 and a member of the Michigan State Senate from 1838 to 1839. He was elected as the second Governor of Michigan in 1840, leading the Whig Party to sweeping statewide victories under the slogan &quot;Woodbridge and reform&quot; (along with William Henry Harrison&#x27;s national campaign). He resigned as governor on February 23, 1841, to take a seat in the United States Senate and was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor, J. Wright Gordon.

Woodbridge was elected to the Senate by the Michigan Legislature and served from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1847. He was only one of two Whig senators who represented Michigan, alongside Augustus S. Porter whom he served with for most of his term. Woodbridge served as chairman of the Committee on Public Lands in the 28th Congress from 1843 to 1844, and of the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office in the 29th Congress from 1845 to 1846. He did not seek reelection.

==Retirement and death==
After leaving the Senate, he retired from public life and devoted his time to horticulture. He died in Detroit and is interred there in Elmwood Cemetery.

The following bear his name:
*Woodbridge Township, Michigan, in Hillsdale County, Michigan
*The Woodbridge Historic District and Woodbridge Avenue in Detroit
*Woodbridge Elementary School in the Zeeland, Michigan Public School district
*Woodbridge Street in Saginaw, Michigan

<text>A word salad is a &quot;confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases&quot;, most often used to describe a symptom of a neurological or mental disorder. The name schizophasia is used in particular to describe the confused language that may be evident in schizophrenia. The words may or may not be grammatically correct, but they are semantically confused to the point that the listener cannot extract any meaning from them. The term is often used in psychiatry as well as in theoretical linguistics to describe a type of grammatical acceptability judgement by native speakers.

==Psychiatry==
Word salad may describe a symptom of neurological or psychiatric conditions in which a person attempts to communicate an idea, but words and phrases that may appear to be random and unrelated come out in an incoherent sequence instead. Often, the person is unaware that they did not make sense. It appears in people with dementia and schizophrenia, as well as after anoxic brain injury. In schizophrenia, it is called &quot;schizophasia&quot;. Clang associations are especially characteristic of mania, as seen in bipolar disorder, as a somewhat more severe variation of flight of ideas. In extreme mania, the patient&#x27;s speech may become incoherent, with associations markedly loosened, thus presenting as a veritable word salad.

It may be present as:
* Clanging, a speech pattern that follows rhyming and other sound associations rather than meaning
* Graphorrhea, a written version of word salad that is more rarely seen than logorrhea in people with schizophrenia
* Logorrhea, a mental condition characterized by excessive talking (incoherent and compulsive)
* Receptive aphasia, fluent in speech but without making sense, often a result of a stroke or other brain injury

==See also==
* Gibberish
* Paragrammatism, inability to produce or create grammatically correct sentences
* Pressure of speech
* Thought disorder

<doc id="544477" wikidata="Q3098501" url="?curid=544477" title="Garth Turner">
<text>John Garth Turner is a Canadian business journalist, author, entrepreneur, broadcaster, financial advisor, and politician, twice elected as a Member of the House of Commons, former Minister of National Revenue and leadership candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. After serving as a PC MP between 1988 and 1993, he returned to political life as a candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, beating Liberal Gary Carr in the riding of Halton, Ontario. On October 18, 2006, the Conservative Party suspended him from the Conservative caucus for his independent stance, and he sat as an Independent MP until February 6, 2007, when he joined the Liberal Party of Canada. His great-grandfather, Ebenezer Vining Bodwell, was also a Liberal Member of Parliament.

== Early life and career ==
Turner was born on March 14, 1949, in Woodstock, Ontario.

He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English literature from the University of Toronto, and a Master of Arts in English literature from the University of Western Ontario. Turner claimed that, during his university years, he joined The Waffle group within the New Democratic Party.

Before entering a career in electoral politics Turner founded and owned weekly newspapers in Ontario. He also worked as an editor for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Metroland Publishing and Thomson Newspapers, and helped launch &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; as a newsweekly magazine. He was subsequently business editor of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; for ten years.

== Progressive Conservative MP ==
Turner was elected as the Progressive Conservative (PC) MP for Halton—Peel in the 1988 election. A Red Tory, he became chairman of the consumer and corporate affairs committee. He became a candidate for the leadership of the PC Party in 1993, placing fourth on the first ballot. In the short-lived cabinet of Kim Campbell he was appointed Minister of National Revenue, but lost his seat in the 1993 election when his party was reduced to just two seats.

== Financial commentator ==
After his election loss, Turner returned to journalism, becoming a business editor for Baton Broadcasting and then the CTV Television Network and authoring a series of books on real estate and personal finance. He became a popular public speaker on financial issues, syndicated newspaper columnist and radio broadcaster.

Also, during this period, Turner became a public speaker, traveling the country and attracting crowds at events often sponsored by financial advisory companies, banks, mutual fund companies and real estate investment companies. He also authored a string of bestsellers, including &#x27;2015: After the Boom&#x27;, &#x27;The Strategy&#x27;, &#x27;The Defence&#x27;, &#x27;2020&#x27; and an annual RRSP guide.

Turner is the founder and former CEO of The Credit River Company, a Caledon-based destination and eco-tourism company that restored heritage buildings in the area. Turner served as national director of the Vancouver-based Sierra Legal Defence Fund, an organization dedicated to upholding environmental laws, resigning after his return to the House of Commons. His charity work included acting as a spokesperson for the Alzheimer Society of Canada.

In April 2008, Turner published &quot;Greater Fool, The Troubled Future of Real Estate&quot;, detailed Turner&#x27;s view of the dangers confronting middle-class Canadians who reside in volatile urban real estate markets across the country. His subsequent book, &quot;After the Crash&quot;, which was published in early 2009, is an examination of the financial crisis gripping North America. In an article published in newspapers in December 2008, the Canadian Press called &quot;Greater Fool&quot; both &quot;prescient&quot; and &quot;scarily bang-on.&quot;
In February 2009, &#x27;After the Crash&#x27; became a national bestseller, according to the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; and Booknet Canada. It concentrates on financial forecasting and strategies for the 2010-2015 period.

In 2009, Turner launched an online retail operation, xurbia.ca, offering renewable and alternative energy products and equipment, as well as preparedness supplies, citing climate change and the ongoing economic downturn as precipitating factors. He also relaunched his pre-election eco-tourism business with the purchase of the historic (1855) Cataract Inn, in Caledon, Ontario, outside of Toronto. Turner also returned to his national speaking tours, focusing on investor education in a string of events once again sponsored by prominent companies in the financial services sector.

== Conservative MP ==
Turner returned to politics with his election as a Conservative MP for Halton, which included most of the territory he had represented in his previous term, in the 2006 general election. Local political organizer Esther Shaye acted as his campaign manager.

Turner was very critical of former Liberal cabinet minister David Emerson&#x27;s floor-crossing to the Conservatives. Turner called for Emerson to resign from Parliament and try to regain his seat in a by-election, saying that &quot;anyone who crosses the floor ultimately should go back to the people for ratification and I stick by it and hopefully in this case that will happen...&quot;
== Liberal MP ==

On October 18, 2006, the Ontario members of the Conservative caucus voted to suspend Turner for what they claimed were violations of caucus confidentiality as published in his weblog. Within hours, Turner was dismissed from the Conservative Party caucus, and ultimately from the Conservative Party of Canada, by edict of the party&#x27;s political leadership. The Conservative Party never furnished evidence of Turner&#x27;s alleged breaches of confidentiality, while Turner argued Prime Minister Stephen Harper could not tolerate an independent-minded MP within his caucus.

On October 19, 2006, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Turner was being courted to become the first ever Green Party of Canada member of Parliament. Turner praised Green leader Elizabeth May on his blog and campaigned for her in her bid to win a seat in the London by-election. According to Turner&#x27;s weblog, his constituents were consulted over a number of weeks, and various options for action were considered: that he remain an independent Member of Parliament with no party affiliation; that he reconcile with the Conservative party; or that he join the Green Party. After a period of introspection and deliberation, on February 6, 2007, Turner surprised many observers by joining the Liberal Party caucus at the invitation of its leader, Stéphane Dion.

The Conservative Party has criticized this decision as contrary to Turner&#x27;s often-declared principle of electoral accountability to voters. In response, Turner repeatedly offered to run in a by-election in his constituency of Halton, Ontario, should David Emerson and Wajid Khan (floor-crossing members in the Conservative caucus, each former Liberals) also run in by-elections in their constituencies held at the same time.

In the 2008 federal election, Turner ran unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party in Halton, being defeated by Conservative Lisa Raitt.

In April 2009, Turner published the book, &quot;Sheeple: Caucus Confidential in Stephen Harper&#x27;s Ottawa,&quot; through Key Porter Books. It is an account of his experiences within and without the caucus of the Conservative Party, and the clash between backroom-style politics and the open blogging Turner pioneered as a web-based MP.

In October 2009, Turner resigned his candidacy for the Liberal nomination in Dufferin—Caledon, stating that then-leader Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s failure to allow a nomination meeting was a signal that his views are unwelcome.

== Financial advisor ==
Turner works as a financial lecturer and an independent, fee-based, licensed financial advisor based in both Toronto and Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, with clients across the country. He is also a blogger, posting daily on economics and real estate at GreaterFool.ca. Throughout his work at GreaterFool.ca, he has been emphasizing the importance of allocating balanced investments in both real estate and financial markets.

<text>The Seven Crystal Balls () is the thirteenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised daily in &quot;&quot;, Belgium&#x27;s leading francophone newspaper, from December 1943 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The story was cancelled abruptly following the Allied liberation in September 1944, when Hergé was blacklisted after being accused of collaborating with the occupying Germans. After he was cleared two years later, the story and its follow-up &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; were then serialised weekly in the new &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from September 1946 to April 1948. The story revolves around the investigations of a young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock into the abduction of their friend Professor Calculus and its connection to a mysterious illness which has afflicted the members of an archaeological expedition to Peru.

&quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have ranked &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; as one of the best &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, describing it as the most frightening installment in the series. The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, the 1997 video game &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, and a 2001 musical in Dutch and French versions.

==Synopsis==

Young reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, meet with their old friend Captain Haddock at his country estate. The naturally humble Haddock is attempting to fit the role at his newfound family château, becoming a socialite and dressing formally. The three spend an evening at a music hall, where they witness the performance of a clairvoyant, Madame Yamilah, who predicts the illness of one of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members; this expedition has recently returned from an archaeological venture to the Andes mountains. The evening&#x27;s entertainment also includes the act of a knife thrower whom Tintin recognises as General Alcazar, former President of San Theodoros. Having befriended Alcazar during one of his previous adventures, Tintin reunites with him backstage after the show. Alcazar introduces Tintin and Haddock to his Quechua assistant, Chiquito, and explains that he is in exile after being deposed (once again) by his rival, General Tapioca.

The next day, Tintin and Haddock learn that members of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition are falling into comas, with fragments of a shattered crystal ball found near each victim. Tintin, Haddock, and their friend Professor Calculus visit the only expedition member yet to be affected, Professor Hercules Tarragon, who is an old friend and former classmate of Calculus&#x27;. Under police guard, Professor Tarragon shows his visitors one of the expedition&#x27;s discoveries from Peru: the mummified body of Inca king Rascar Capac. That evening, a lightning storm strikes the house and sends ball lightning down the chimney and onto the mummy—which evaporates. Worried, Tarragon states that this reflects the culmination of Capac&#x27;s prophecy, which declares that punishment will descend upon those who desecrate his tomb. Spending the stormy night at Tarragon&#x27;s house, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus are each awoken by a dream involving Capac&#x27;s mummy throwing a crystal ball to the floor. They find Tarragon comatose in his bed, with the accompanying crystal shards nearby; the attacker had bypassed the guards by climbing in via the chimney. The next day while Tarragon is being examined by a doctor, Calculus is walking on the grounds of Tarragon&#x27;s house when he discovers one of the mummy&#x27;s bracelets, which he places on himself.

Tintin and Haddock later realise that Calculus has gone missing, and surmise that he has been kidnapped by the same individual who placed Tarragon in a coma. The police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars and are able to evade them. Tintin visits a hospital where the seven stricken members of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition are housed; he is astonished that at a precise time of day, all awaken and scream about figures attacking them before slipping back into their comas. Haddock is dejected by Calculus&#x27; abduction, but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper&#x27;s car at a port, he and Tintin race there to Westermouth, believing that the abductors seek to board a boat with Calculus and take him abroad. At the docks, they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America; he reveals that Chiquito was one of the last descendants of the Inca and has disappeared. Tintin surmises that Chiquito must be one of Calculus&#x27; captors.

Having lost Calculus&#x27; trail, Tintin and Haddock decide to pay a visit to Haddock&#x27;s old friend Chester, who has docked at another nearby port. They miss Chester, but instead discover Calculus&#x27; hat on the docks, indicating that he was taken to sea from here. Investigating, they realise that Calculus must be aboard the &quot;Pachacamac&quot;, a ship headed to Peru, and board a flight, intent on intercepting its arrival.

==History==

===Background===
&quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; began serialization amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. Hergé had accepted a position working for &#x27;, Belgium&#x27;s largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, &#x27; was permitted by the German authorities to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. Joining &#x27; on 15 October 1940, Hergé was aided by old friend Paul Jamin and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke. Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, although he was heavily enticed by the size of &quot;s readership, which reached 600,000. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Without the need to satirise political types, entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that &quot;Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively&quot;.

Following the culmination of his previous &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure, &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, Hergé had agreed to a proposal that would allow the newspaper to include a detective story revolving around his characters, Thomson and Thompson. Titled &quot;Dupont et Dupond, détectives&quot; (&quot;Thomson and Thompson, Detectives&quot;), Hergé provided the illustrations, and the story was authored by &#x27; crime writer Paul Kinnet. While this was being serialised, Hergé began contemplating ideas for his new &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure, toying with the idea of a story surrounding a dangerous invention that Calculus had developed. The story was probably inspired by an article authored by &#x27; science correspondent, Bernard Heuvelmans, and while Hergé did not use this idea at the time, he revived it a decade later as the basis for &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;.

As with Hergé&#x27;s two previous stories, &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; was designed as part of a twofold story arc, to be concluded with the then yet unnamed &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. Hergé planned for the former story to outline a mystery, while the latter would see his characters undertake an expedition to solve it. His use of an ancient mummy&#x27;s curse around which the narrative revolved was inspired by tales of a curse of the pharaohs which had been unearthed during the archaeologist Howard Carter&#x27;s 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. This was not the first time that Hergé had been inspired by this tabloid story, having previously drawn from it when authoring &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;.

In autumn 1943, Hergé decided that he wanted Edgar P. Jacobs, a fellow cartoonist, to collaborate with him on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. The two became close friends and artistic collaborators, as Jacobs aided Hergé in developing various aspects of the plot, such as the idea of the crystal balls and the story&#x27;s title. Although stylistically the two men were different both in forms of illustration and narrative, they influenced each other greatly. Hergé used Jacobs as a life model from whom he drew various poses that characters adopt in the story. He also used Jacobs as a researcher, sending him to the Cinquantenaire Museum to study its collections of Incan material. Like Jacobs in &quot;The U-Ray&quot;, he used as a basis for the creation of Rascar Capac the drawing of a Chachapoya mummy from the Larousse encyclopaedia and not, as was widely believed, a mummy from the Cinquantenaire Museum.

The museum&#x27;s director, Professor Capart, exhibited similarities with Professor Tarragon, a new character that Hergé had developed for the story. Hergé also included a number of characters who had previously appeared in earlier adventures, among them Professor Cantonneau from &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, General Alcazar from &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, and Bianca Castafiore from &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;.

The scenery and background of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus&#x27; abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered to the reality of the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon&#x27;s house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé&#x27;s purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; the house had been requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.

===Publication===
The story began serialisation in &#x27; under the title of &#x27; on 16 December 1943. However, Hergé&#x27;s health declined, as he was afflicted with flu, sinusitis, and ear ache. This was accompanied by general exhaustion, depression, and fear that upon the imminent collapse of German administration, he would face retribution as a collaborator; many accused of being collaborators had already been killed by the Belgian Resistance. Experiencing a breakdown, he took a hiatus from producing &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; between 6 May and 6 July 1944, during which a message was posted in &quot; stating:

:They&#x27;re coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, since you have not heard anything about them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.

The story returned to its serialisation in &quot; on 7 July, starting with a summary of the story so far.
However, it would be interrupted again on 2 September 1944. Brussels was liberated from German occupation by the Allied forces on 3 September, upon which &quot;&quot; immediately ceased publication. Hergé had been forced to abandon the story after 152 strips, equivalent to fifty pages of the later published book volume. The story had been left unfinished after the scene in which Tintin leaves the hospital where he sees the seven members of the expedition enduring a simultaneous fit. Three days later the entire staff were fired and a new editorial team introduced.

Hergé was arrested on 3 September, having been named as a collaborator in a Resistance document known as the &quot;Gallery of Traitors&quot;. This would be the first of four incidents in which Hergé was arrested and freed: by the State Security, the Judiciary Police, the Belgian National Movement, and the Front for Independence, during which he spent one night in jail.
On 8 September the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force issued a proclamation announcing that &quot;any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession&quot;. Blacklisted, Hergé was now unemployed. A newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance, &quot;La Patrie&quot;, issued a strip titled &quot;The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis&quot;, in which Hergé was lampooned as a collaborator.

The period witnessed widespread allegations against accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or capital punishment. A judiciary inquiry into Hergé&#x27;s case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vinçotte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that &quot;I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children&#x27;s book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Hergé worked for &quot;&quot; during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper&quot;. Unable to work for the press, Hergé worked from home re-drawing, and Jacobs colouring, the older &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; for publication by his book publisher Casterman, completing the second version of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; and starting on &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful. He and Jacobs produced a comic strip under the pseudonym of &quot;Olav&quot;, although no publishers accepted it. Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life, he also had family problems to deal with; his brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German prisoner-of-war camp and their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a psychiatric hospital.

In October 1945, Hergé was approached by Raymond Leblanc, a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the National Royalist Movement (MNR), and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children. Leblanc, who had fond childhood memories of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, thought Hergé would be ideal for it. Hergé agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work. Concerned about the judicial investigation into Hergé&#x27;s wartime affiliations, Leblanc convinced William Ugeux, a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship, to look into the comic creator&#x27;s file. Ugeux concluded that Hergé had been &quot;a blunderer rather than a traitor&quot; for his work at &quot;&quot;. The decision whether Hergé would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal, Walter Ganshof van der Meersch. He closed the case on 22 December, declaring that &quot;in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi, bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky&quot;.

Now free from threat of prosecution, he continued to support his colleagues at &quot;&quot; who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Hergé&#x27;s friend, Paul Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother&#x27;s death at age 60 in April 1946.
Harry Thompson has described this post-war period as the &quot;greatest upheaval&quot; of Hergé&#x27;s life. Hergé later described it as &quot;an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!&quot; He considered the post-war trials of collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.

Leblanc&#x27;s new magazine was titled &quot;Tintin&quot; at the advice of Sinave, who believed that this would help attract a wide audience. Adopting the slogan of &quot;The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s logo featured the Tintin character himself. Inspired by the example set by &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;, &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine was to be a weekly, centred on the eponymous hero. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; would be serialised two pages per week, accompanied by other Franco-Belgian comics. For the first time, the &quot;Adventures&quot; would be in colour from the outset. Hergé assembled a team of artists for the purpose, including Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Van Melkebeke, who became the magazine&#x27;s first editor.
Hergé continued at the point where he had left &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, prior to embarking on &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, although both were published under the title of &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Temple of the Sun&quot;). Rather than re-serialising the story from its beginning, he began the new magazine with a summary of the story so far, presented as a press clipping. The magazine was an instant success, soon gaining a weekly circulation of 100,000 in Belgium and the Netherlands. Serialisation of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; concluded on 22 April 1948, four and a half years after it had begun.

===Republication===

As with previous adventures, it then began serialisation in the French Catholic newspaper &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, from 19 May 1946. After the story had finished serialisation, the publishing company Casterman divided it into two volumes, &#x27; and &#x27;, which they released in 1948 and 1949 respectively.
One of the scenes that had been found in &quot;&quot;, in which Haddock is humiliated by the clairvoyant at the theatre, was removed from the story when it was being reformatted in book form.
The book contained additional backgrounds not found in the original serialised story which had been drawn by Jacobs.

When translated into English for a publication by Methuen in 1963, a number of Francophone place-names were changed; for instance, the port of Saint-Nazaire was renamed Westermouth, which, according to author Michael Farr, was probably inspired by the real English coastal town of Weymouth. As the English-language translation was published after the English translation of other &quot;Tintin&quot; adventures, which had actually been authored later than &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, in the English version, references are made to events that would occur in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; and &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;.

==Critical analysis==
Biographer Benoît Peeters described &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; as &quot;the most terrifying of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;&quot;. He believed that in this story, Hergé had come under the clear influence of Jacobs, in that the &quot;décor grows more lush; the details clearer. No more streets suggested by a few lines, monochromatic posters, or characters walking on the edge of the frame&quot;. Elsewhere, he noted that in this story, Hergé &quot;produced a gripping tale that went further than any other in the direction of the supernatural&quot;.
Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline believed that &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; achieved &quot;a more complete integration of narrative and illustrations&quot; than previous adventures, and that from that point on, his books &quot;begin to form a coherent body of work, an oeuvre&quot;.

Harry Thompson stated that the &quot;overriding theme&quot; of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; was &quot;fear of the unknown&quot;, adding that while it did blend humour with menace, it remained &quot;Hergé&#x27;s most frightening book&quot;. He noted that the story marks the complete transition of Captain Haddock from the &quot;pitiable drunk&quot; which he was introduced as in &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; to the position of &quot;chief sidekick and comic attraction&quot;, with Snowy being relegated to the position of &quot;normal dog&quot;.

Michael Farr described both &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; as &quot;classic middle-period Tintin&quot;, commenting on their &quot;surprisingly well-balanced narrative&quot; and noting that they exhibited scant evidence of Hergé&#x27;s turbulent personal life. He felt that &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; encapsulated the &quot;air of doom&quot; which pervaded the mood of Europe at the time to an even greater extent than Hergé had done in his earlier work, &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;. At the same time, Farr thought it to be &quot;a simple detective story&quot;, comparing Tintin&#x27;s hunt for clues regarding Calculus&#x27; disappearance to Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. He thought that the story was &quot;truly Hitchcockian in its suspense and quite cinematic in its presentation&quot;, comparing the use of the music hall in the story with its use in Hitchcock&#x27;s film, &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935). Farr suggested that in the scene in which Haddock dejectedly sits around Marlinspike awaiting news of Calculus, &quot;Hergé had allowed himself to step for a moment into Haddock&#x27;s shoes and to be autobiographical&quot;.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that the two-story arc represents &quot;one more leap forward in Hergé&#x27;s graphic and narrative skills&quot; as a result of the transition to full colour double pages as the initial means of publication. They noted that &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; is &quot;bathed in the surreal atmosphere that Hergé knew how to create so well&quot;, with Tintin confronting &quot;a dark and oppressive force&quot; that was &quot;worthy of a Hammer film&quot;. They particularly praised the characters of Professor Tarragon and Mark Falconer (Marc Chalet), describing the former as &quot;to archaeology what Haddock is to the sea&quot;, and that the latter resembled an older Tintin with darker hair, noting that &quot;one regrets that their appearances are all too brief, and wonders what the adventures of Falconer and Tarragon would be like&quot;. Ultimately, the Lofficiers awarded both halves of the story arc five out of five.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy also praised Tarragon, stating that he exudes a presence &quot;far beyond what we might expect from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist&quot;. He then compared the scenario in which Tarragon was trapped within his home to that in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house. He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. He argued that the way in which Alcazar was presented as Tintin&#x27;s friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac&#x27;s jewels reflected Hergé&#x27;s use of jewels as a theme throughout the series, while the mummy&#x27;s removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb.

In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the academic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed that &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;-&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; arc reflects a confrontation between civilisations, and between the sacred and the secular.
He also discussed Haddock&#x27;s position in the story, noting that the scene at the theatre in which a bull&#x27;s head mask falls onto Haddock&#x27;s head reflects &quot;one of Hergé&#x27;s most constant themes: the union of human and animal&quot;. He further added the opinion that Haddock&#x27;s transformation from seaman to country gentleman was not believable.
He suggested that the appearance of Yamila and Castafiore at the start of the story injected &quot;a feminine element&quot; into the story, which represented an attempt to &quot;round out Haddock&#x27;s family&quot;, which was dominated by the male figures of Tintin, Calculus, and Snowy. He further argued that Calculus&#x27; kidnapping represented a &quot;rite of passage&quot; that would allow him to join Tintin and Haddock&#x27;s family.

==Adaptations==

In 1969, the animation company Belvision Studios, which had produced the 1956–57 television series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, released its first feature-length animated film, &quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot;, adapted from the &quot;Seven Crystal Balls&quot;-&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; story arc. Produced by Raymond Leblanc and directed by Eddie Lateste, it was written by Lateste, the cartoonist Greg, Jos Marissen, and Laszló Molnár. Music was by François Rauber and Zorrino&#x27;s song was composed by Jacques Brel. Lofficier and Lofficier commented that the part of the film based on &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; &quot;suffers from being overly condensed for timing reasons&quot;.

In 1991, a second animated series based upon &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; was the eleventh story to be adapted and was divided into two thirty-minute episodes. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot; to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé&#x27;s original panels.

The video game &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; was developed and published by the French company Infogrames in 1997, based on &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;.

At the turn of the new century, &quot;Tintin&quot; remained popular. In 2001, &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; were adapted into a theatrical musical, &quot;Kuifje – De Zonnetempel&quot; (&quot;Tintin – The Temple of the Sun&quot;), which premiered at the Stadsschouwburg in Antwerp in the Dutch language on 15 September. The production, directed by Dirk de Caluwé, adapted by Seth Gaaikema and Frank Van Laecke with music by Dirk Brossé, featured Tom Van Landuyt as Tintin. The musical was adapted by Didier Van Cauwelaert into French and premiered a year later in Charleroi as &quot;Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil&quot;. From there, the production was scheduled for Paris in 2003 but was cancelled. It returned for a brief run in Antwerp on 18 October 2007.

<text>Chek Lap Kok is an island in the western waters of Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories. Unlike the smaller Lam Chau, it was only partially leveled when it was assimilated via land reclamation into the island for the current Hong Kong International Airport, which opened for commercial aviation in 1998. The airport is popularly referred to as &quot;Chek Lap Kok Airport&quot; to distinguish it from the former Hong Kong International Airport, now commonly known as Kai Tak Airport.

Hong Kong SkyCity, a business and entertainment complex, is also located on Chek Lap Kok. It includes AsiaWorld–Expo, a convention and exhibition centre, which opened in 2005. Cathay Pacific City, the head office of Cathay Pacific; HAECO, and formerly Hong Kong Airlines are also located on the airport platform.

==Name==
The name of the island may be derived from the bareness of the island (&#x27;da chek lak&#x27;), that the shape of the island resembles the Pagrus (&#x27;chek lap&#x27;, ), or that the fish was once abundant in its vicinity.

==Geography==
The island is located north of Lantau Island off Ma Wan Chung and Tung Chung. Before the building of the airport platform, it was a small and hilly island, about long, with an area of (other sources mention ). The southern end of the island formed a small peninsula, which has been left largely undeveloped. This area is facing Tung Chung and is now named Scenic Hill. It is the site of the Ancient Kiln Park and the Airport Island Angle Station of the Ngong Ping 360 cable car.

==History==
The island has been inhabited on and off since the Middle Neolithic period 6,000 years ago.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the inhabitants of the island practiced farming, including rice cultivation, and quarrying.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Chek Lap Kok was 77. The number of males was 55. The population was about 200 in the 1950s, rising sharply in the 1960s. The population later declined, with some 20 families remaining on the island when the plan for the construction of a new airport was announced in the early 1990s.

Archeological surveys and investigations were conducted on the island starting in the late 1970s. A salvage archaeology project started in October 1990.

The original farming and fishing villages on the island were relocated to Chek Lap Kok New Village aka. Chek Lap Kok San Tsuen () near Tung Chung on Lantau Island. A Tin Hau Temple had been built in 1823 at the north east of the island. The entire temple was built of granite quarried on the island. It was dismantled in 1991 and rebuilt in 1994 at its present location. Chek Lap Kok San Tsuen is a recognized village under the New Territories Small House Policy.

Also, Romer&#x27;s tree frog (&quot;Philautus romeri&quot;), a unique species of finger-sized frog found only in Hong Kong, was relocated from Chek Lap Kok to new habitats on Lantau Island before construction of the airport.

A third runway at Hong Kong Airport is being built as part of the Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030.

==Climate==
== Education ==
Most of Lantau Island, including Chek Lap Kok New Village, is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 98, which contains multiple aided schools on Lantau Island; no government primary schools are in this net.

<doc id="544484" wikidata="Q7832053" url="?curid=544484" title="Trade justice">
<text>Trade justice is a campaign by non-governmental organisations, plus efforts by other actors, to change the rules and practices of world trade in order to promote fairness. These organizations include consumer groups, trade unions, faith groups, aid agencies and environmental groups.

The organizations campaigning for trade justice posit this concept in opposition to free trade. Supporters of free trade, typically those in economics, business, lobbying, and the mainstream press, trust in the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of the market to provide on its own for the needs of societies around the world. Fundamental to their beliefs is the value of individual liberty, believed to be the least infringed upon when the market is used to replace most of the centralized government&#x27;s responsibilities of allocating resources. They tend to support neoliberal policies of privatization, deregulation, and tax cuts, and on the international trade level, policies that loosen restrictions on corporations’ ability to trade and make profits across borders. Rupert argues that because free trade advocates placed themselves on the side of &quot;science,&quot; they would label activists as ignorant, protectionist, and selfish. Activists would be designated as &quot;anti-globalization,&quot; a term first coined by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.

Trade justice advocates are not anti-globalization, but are instead against corporate-centered trade liberalization which ignores labor, environmental, and human rights. They argue that truly free trade does not and will never exist, and that governmental policies on trade should be in the public interest, rather than the interest of wealthy entities who they argue try to influence trade negotiation to benefit their individual interests. Rupert argues that they are cautious of the spread of neoliberal policies to the point where the power of private corporations will be enhanced to the point of &quot;business totalitarianism&quot;. Advocates of trade justice argue that growing inequity and serious gaps in social justice, and the global export of terrorism, are symptoms of an economic system that permits harms to be exported to other countries, while importing their goods. They point to extinction, deforestation, social unrest, as consequences of globalization, and in particular of an &quot;unfair&quot; globalization. In the past, the responses sought by critics of the international trade system included various penalties on &quot;unfair&quot; goods. This argument generally made little headway against the long-term movement towards free trade; imposition of penalties for &quot;dumping&quot; was sometimes motivated by domestic political reasons such as the United States imposition of steel tariffs in 2001.

Today, the trade justice movement concentrates more on the abolition of agricultural subsidies and dumping, and to a much lesser extent on offsetting penalties on &quot;unfair&quot; goods. Indeed, although there are many who are still critical of free trade in general, there is a trend towards campaigning against what is seen as hypocrisy by developed countries in using protectionism against the poorest countries, especially in agricultural products, while requiring them to leave their own producers without protection.

== Trade justice movement ==

The Trade Justice Movement in the UK was the first formal coalition of groups to use the term &quot;trade justice&quot; (partly because in the UK, &quot;fair trade&quot; usually refers to Fairtrade certification and is a consumer model of change rather than an overtly political movement calling for government action). The term trade justice has been widely adopted internationally by campaign groups, for example by the over 100 national platforms of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty where it is one of the four main demands. In many countries &quot;fair trade&quot; is used as well as or instead of &quot;trade justice&quot;.

The global institutions that are most often targeted in trade justice campaigns against the alleged injustices of the current international trade system are the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB). Campaigners also lobby their own governments with the intention of creating pressure on them to prioritise poverty reduction when making international trade rules. In trading blocs such as the European Union (EU), the campaigns seek to influence policy across a number of member state governments.

&quot;Trade Justice&quot; and &quot;Fair Trade&quot; were originally used by those supporting social justice and the alleviation of the intense poverty found in many developing nations. They contrasted &quot;fair trade&quot; with &#x27;unfair&#x27; international trade practices. It is associated particularly with labour unions and environmentalists, in their criticism of disparities between the protections for capital versus those for labour and the environment. The use of the term has expanded beyond campaigns to reform current trading practices, and the major institutions such as the World Trade Organization which embody them. Now it has become a movement to allow consumers to choose &quot;not&quot; to participate in these practices. Fairtrade labelling or &quot;Fairtrade certification&quot; allows consumers to identify goods especially commodities such as coffee, that meet certain agreed standards of fairness.

=== Framing ===
Ayres argues that generating a clear consensus between different groups in the trade justice movement is straightforward for &quot;diagnostic framing&quot;– identifying the problem and its many identifiable negative effects. They can agree that free trade policies have contributed to the rising debt of developing countries, the widening wealth gaps, economic instability, environmental degradation, human rights abuses, and poverty. Organizations have difficulty consolidating a &quot;prognostic framing&quot;– how advocates should go about actually solving the problems they have identified. Some hope to reform the WTO and include rights considerations in trade agreements, while others hope for more extreme measures. When it comes to strategies, some lean more towards collaborating with existing powers through NGOs, while others hope to make change through grassroots organization and protesting.

== Issues ==

Academics such as Thomas Alured Faunce argue that the insertion of a constructive ambiguity such as valuing innovation in bilateral trade agreements (and then according normative and ongoing lobbying power to such textual negotiating truces by formally linking them with non-violation nullification of benefits provisions) may undermine democratic sovereignty with regard to construction of domestic policy, particularly in areas such as the environment and public health. This view is strenuously contested by trade law officials and many domestic policy makers.

&quot;The mostly widely referred to demand of trade justice campaigners is access to the markets of developed countries or rich countries. When developing countries export to developed country markets, they often face tariff barriers that can be as much as four times higher than those encountered by developed countries. Poverty claims that those barriers cost poor countries $100 billion a year – twice as much as they receive in aid.&quot;

The term &quot;trade justice&quot; emphasizes that even if the playing field were level, instead of tilted against developing countries, the poorest developing countries in particular would still struggle to gain from trade if forced to trade under free trade terms. This is because of their overwhelming lack of competitiveness – poor countries do not have huge stocks of exports waiting to be shipped to rich countries, instead most small farmers want to be able to sell their goods locally.

=== Subsidies ===
Most trade justice campaigners focus in some way on the agricultural subsidies of rich countries that make it difficult for farmers in poor countries to compete. For example, they argue that the European Union&#x27;s agricultural export subsidies encourage overproduction of goods such as tomatoes or sugar, which are then sold cheaply or &#x27;dumped&#x27; in poor countries. Local farmers cannot sell their goods as cheaply and go out of business.

The campaign points to the treatment of agriculture at the WTO, which has institutionalized these injustices. In the few instances where developing countries have used the complex and expensive WTO process to declare subsidies (e.g. US cotton subsidies) excessive, developed countries ignore these rulings, which the WTO itself does not enforce. Recently rich countries have begun to talk about cutting export subsidies, but they often demand greater access to poor country markets in return.

== The Impact of Trade on the Environment ==
According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), there is both a positive and negative impact of trade on the environment. On the one hand, economic growth from trade can negatively affect the environment in two ways. First, economic growth increases pollution due to natural resource extraction. As the world looks to transition towards a more environmentally friendly economy, global demand for lithium-ion batteries – a key component in electric vehicles – is expected to reach 2.2 million tonnes by 2030. The extractivism required to mine lithium leads to air, water, and soil pollution due to the toxic chemicals used during the mining process, and the depletion of local water reserves. Second, trade liberalization can lead to specialization in pollution-intensive sectors if environmental regulations are different across countries (pollution haven hypothesis). Conversely, economic growth stemming from trade increases the capacity of a country to manage the environment more efficiently and stricter environmental regulations in certain countries have a spillover effect that will force suppliers to adapt to environmentally conscious markets. These environmental policies create markets for environmental goods to be exported to countries that follow the same standards.

=== Challenges for Environmental Protection in Trade ===
Environmental justice efforts are a significant component of the trade justice movement. The principle of free trade based on economic opportunity for all ignores the environmental degradation that comes as a result. Moreover, power imbalances within the WTO, the United Nations and other international governing bodies have allowed developed countries to control environmental trade regulations. This has led to disagreements regarding whether environmentalism protects the global South and its resources or is an imperialist tool to stunt the economic and industrial growth of developing nations. In particular, the former argument states that &quot;robust environmental regulation&quot; is needed to protect the &quot;natural resource base upon which the South relies for survival.&quot; However, others claim that international governing bodies cannot set environmental policy based on equality rather than equity; these policies cannot overlook the fact that the global North&#x27;s consumption habits are the primary cause of environmental degradation. Environmental burdens must be distributed proportionately for environmentalism to not be used as a neo-imperial tool. This perspective has been enhanced by controversies of the Summers memo and many instances of improper waste disposal in the Global South based on weak political infrastructures that allow large organizations to avoid strict regulation.&quot;While Southern elites can insulate themselves to some extent from the consequences of the waste trade by moving into more pristine communities with better access to clean air and water and uncontaminated land, it is the poor who must suffer the consequences of environmental degradation. Far from being a luxury, environmental protection is necessary to preserve the health, safety and well-being of the Southern poor.&quot;Despite a push by the OECD to increase demand for environmental products and technology, thereby complementing trade with environmental policy, examples as recent as fall 2021 show nations disregarding these considerations. A leaked document from the UK&#x27;s Department for International Trade says that trade negotiators should prioritize economic growth over the environment in trade deals. This document comes after it was found that the UK dropped climate related promises to finalize a trade deal with Australia.

Ultimately, the debate continues as environmentalists prioritize environmental protection over economic growth and governing bodies and organizations stall to implement binding policy. Many researchers and environmental groups demand increased transparency and participation from non-governmental stakeholders in policy adjudication.

=== The Future of Environmental Trade ===
The challenge for the Trade Justice movement, particularly from an environmental perspective, is embedding principles of environmental stewardship that inspires a new generation of trade agreements. Previous free trade deals have favoured investor rights that disregard environmental concerns. Professors from Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Halifax argue that future treaties must have rules with enforceable commitments and dispute settling bodies, such as those found at the WTO, and not the voluntary actions undertaken in treaties like The Paris Agreement. The authors assert that multilateral forums found in the UN are perceived as places where progressive agendas go to die as they are hindered by opposition or disinterest from powerful states who prioritize their national interests over the common good. A solution is to strengthen the language surrounding environmental regulations in treaties to match those found in the investment rights sections of trade deals.

<doc id="544485" wikidata="Q7030303" url="?curid=544485" title="Nicollet Avenue">
<text>Nicollet Avenue ( ) is a major street in Minneapolis, Richfield, Bloomington, and Burnsville in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It passes through a number of locally well-known neighborhoods and districts, notably Eat Street in south Minneapolis and the traffic-restricted Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis.

==Route description==

The avenue begins at Grant Street in Loring Park and continues south to West 29th Street/Cecil B. Newman Lane, where it is interrupted by a K-Mart store, and begins again at Lake Street, continuing through Richfield and Bloomington to 107th Street just north of the Minnesota River. Across the river in Burnsville, Nicollet begins again at Cliff Road West and ends at County Road 42. Nicollet is a major commercial street in Burnsville, forming one of two main streets of their Heart of the City downtown area.

Nicollet is a city street in Minneapolis and Burnsville, while it is designated as Hennepin County Road 52 between 98th Street in Bloomington and W 61st St in Minneapolis (just north of the Richfield border). This designation resumes on Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, though the county highway is not contiguous.

==History==

Nicollet Avenue began as a military road between St. Anthony Falls and Fort Snelling. It was named for early 19th-century French explorer and cartographer Joseph Nicollet, who led three expeditions in what is now Minnesota. Nicollet Mall occupies the oldest section of the avenue. Before the mall was constructed in 1968, Nicollet Avenue stretched from the Mississippi River to the Minnesota River.

One block of the street between 29th Street and Lake Street was removed in the 1977 to build a Kmart store (opened in 1978) which covers two city blocks, detouring southbound traffic to Blaisdell Avenue and northbound traffic to First Avenue South. 
The city of Minneapolis has planned to restore Nicollet Avenue by reconstructing the Kmart site into a new configuration that would include both commercial and residential development since at least 2010. After a building fire at the former Kmart in October 2023, the building was torn down in November 2023. The city of Minneapolis announced proposed street layouts for a reconnected Nicollet Ave in October 2023. Construction is expected to start in 2025.

==Transit==
The Dan Patch Line, a separate railroad serving communities as far south as Northfield, Minnesota, ran parallel to the streetcar line between 60th Street and Diamond Lake Road. Nicollet Station, a carhouse originally built for the Motor Line, was acquired and expanded by Twin City Rapid Transit; after the streetcar system was dismantled in 1953–1954, the carbarn has since been used for transit system buses. The station is located at Nicollet and 31st Street, just south of the site of the Minneapolis Millers&#x27; Nicollet Park baseball field, which closed in 1955.

The Metro Transit route 18 bus travels most of Nicollet Avenue. Historically, Nicollet had rail transportation, starting with the Minneapolis, Lyndale &amp; Minnetonka Railway Co., also known as the &quot;Motor Line&quot;. The Motor Line ran along Marquette Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, then turned west for one block at 13th Street South to reach Nicollet. The line was constructed south to 31st Street in 1879, to 37th Street in 1884, and was extended further south to 50th Street in 1887. It was converted to streetcar operation in 1890, and the Twin City Rapid Transit Company (TCRT) extended the route to Diamond Lake Road in 1911, 58th Street in 1928, and 62nd Street (now Minnesota State Highway 62) in 1947. Streetcars on the road had a service frequency of one every five minutes off-peak, and ran about twice as often during the morning and afternoon peak periods.

==In popular culture==

The avenue was used as a backdrop for the end of the famous opening sequence of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, in which a jubilant Moore tosses her hat into the air while watched by a curious group of passersby who were, in fact, real people and not extras.

<doc id="544494" wikidata="Q217575" url="?curid=544494" title="STS-114">
<text>STS-114 was the first &quot;Return to Flight&quot; Space Shuttle mission following the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. &quot;Discovery&quot; launched at 10:39 EDT (14:39 UTC) on her 31st flight on July 26, 2005. The launch, 907 days (approx. 29 months) after the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;, was approved despite unresolved fuel sensor anomalies in the external tank that had prevented the shuttle from launching on July 13, its originally scheduled date.

The mission ended on August 9, 2005, when &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Poor weather over the Kennedy Space Center in Florida hampered the shuttle from using its primary landing site.

Analysis of the launch footage showed debris separating from the external tank during ascent; this was of particular concern because it was the issue that had set off the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. As a result, NASA decided on July 27 to postpone future shuttle flights pending additional modifications to the flight hardware. Shuttle flights resumed a year later with STS-121 on July 4, 2006.

===Original crew===
This mission was to carry the Expedition 7 crew to the ISS and bring home the Expedition 6 crew. The original crew was to be:

==Mission highlights==


STS-114 marked the return to flight of the Space Shuttle after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster and was the second Shuttle flight with a female commander (Eileen Collins, who also commanded the STS-93 mission). The STS-114 mission was initially to be flown aboard the orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot;, but NASA replaced it with &quot;Discovery&quot; after improperly installed gear was found in &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; Rudder Speed Brake system. During OMM for &quot;Discovery&quot;, an actuator on the RSB system was found to be installed incorrectly. This created a fleet wide suspect condition. The Rudder Speed Brake system was removed and refurbished on all three remaining orbiter vehicles, and since &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s RSB was corrected first, it became the new Return to Flight vehicle, superseding &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Seventeen years prior, &quot;Discovery&quot; had flown NASA&#x27;s previous Return to Flight mission, STS-26.

The STS-114 mission delivered supplies to the International Space Station. However, the major focus of the mission was testing and evaluating new Space Shuttle flight safety techniques, which included new inspection and repair techniques. The crewmembers used the new Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) – a set of instruments on a extension attached to the Canadarm. The OBSS instrument package consists of visual imaging equipment and a Laser Dynamic Range Imager (LDRI) to detect problems with the shuttle&#x27;s Thermal Protection System (TPS). The crew scanned the leading edges of the wings, the nose cap, and the crew compartment for damage, as well as other potential problem areas engineers wished to inspect based on video taken during lift-off.

STS-114 was classified as Logistics Flight 1. The flight carried the &quot;Raffaello&quot; Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, built by the Italian Space Agency, as well as the External Stowage Platform-2, which was mounted to the port side of the Quest Airlock. They deployed MISSE 5 to the station&#x27;s exterior, and replaced one of the ISS&#x27;s Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMG). The CMG was carried up on the LMC (Lightweight Multi-Purpose Experiment Support Structure Carrier) at the rear of the payload bay, together with the TPS Repair Box.
The crew conducted three spacewalks while at the station. The first demonstrated repair techniques on the Shuttle&#x27;s Thermal Protection System. During the second, the spacewalkers replaced the failed gyroscope. On the third, they installed the External Stowage Platform and repaired the shuttle, the first time repairs had been carried out during a spacewalk on the exterior of a spacecraft in flight. On August 1, it was announced that protruding gap fillers on the front underside of the shuttle would be inspected and dealt with during the third spacewalk of the mission. The spacewalk was conducted on the morning of August 3. Robinson easily removed the two fillers with his fingers. Later on the same day, NASA officials said that they were looking closely at a thermal blanket located next to the commander&#x27;s window on the port side of the orbiter. Published reports on August 4, 2005, said that wind tunnel testing had demonstrated that the orbiter was safe to re-enter with the billowed blanket.

On July 30, 2005, NASA announced that STS-114 would be extended for one day, so that &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s crew could help the ISS crew maintain the station while the shuttle fleet was grounded. The extra day was also used to move more items from the shuttle to the ISS, as uncertainty mounted during the mission as to when a shuttle would next visit the station. The orbiter&#x27;s arrival also gave the nearly 200-ton space station a free altitude boost of about . The station loses about of altitude a day.

The shuttle hatch was closed the night before it undocked from the ISS. After undocking, the shuttle flew around the station to take photos.

Atmospheric reentry and landing was originally planned for August 8, 2005, at Kennedy Space Center, but unsuitable weather postponed the landing until the next day, then moved it to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where &quot;Discovery&quot; touched down at 08:11EDT (05:11 am PDT, 12:11 UTC).

==Launch sequence anomalies==

Around 2.5 seconds after lift-off, a large bird struck near the top of the external fuel tank, and appeared in subsequent video frames to slide down the tank. NASA did not expect this to hurt the mission because it did not hit the orbiter, and because the vehicle was traveling relatively slowly at the time.

A small fragment of thermal tile, estimated to be around in size, was ejected from an edge tile of the front landing gear door at some point before SRB separation. A small white area appeared on the tile as the piece detached, and the loose shard could be seen in a single frame of the video. It is unknown what object (if any) struck the tile to cause the damage. The damaged tile was inspected further when the images from the umbilical camera were downloaded on day three. Engineers requested that this area be inspected by the OBSS, and flight managers scheduled the operation for July 29, 2005. This represented the only known possible damage to &quot;Discovery&quot; that could have posed a risk during re-entry.

At 127.1 seconds after liftoff, and 5.3 seconds after SRB separation, a large piece of debris separated from the Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp, which is part of the external tank. The debris was thought to have measured 36.3 by 11 by 6.7 inches (922 by 279 by 170 mm) – and to weigh about , or half as much as the piece of foam blamed for the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;. The debris piece did not strike any part of the &quot;Discovery&quot; orbiter. Images of the external tank taken after separation from the orbiter show multiple areas where foam insulation was missing.

Around 20 seconds later, a smaller piece of foam separated from the ET and apparently struck the orbiter&#x27;s right wing. Based on the mass of the foam, and the velocity at which it would have struck the wing, NASA estimated it only exerted one-tenth the energy required to cause potential damage. Laser scanning and imaging of the wing by the OBSS did not reveal any damage. On July 27, 2005, NASA announced that it was postponing all Shuttle flights until the foam loss problem could be resolved.

As with &quot;Columbia&quot;, NASA at first believed that workers&#x27; improper installation and handling of the external tanks at the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana caused the foam loss on &quot;Discovery&quot;. NASA Administrator Michael Griffin stated that the earliest the next shuttle could launch is September 22, 2005, but that&#x27;s only &quot;if next week, the guys have an &quot;Aha! effect&quot; on the foam and spot why this big chunk came off.&quot; Later in August, it became clear that a September launch date would not be possible, and that the earliest date for the next launch would be in March 2006. However, because Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, the next launch was delayed further. With the destruction suffered by Michoud and NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi due to Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding, the launch of the next shuttle mission (STS-121) was further delayed until July 4, 2006.

In December 2005 x-ray photographs of another tank showed that thermal expansion and contraction during filling, not human error, caused the cracks that resulted in foam loss. NASA official Wayne Hale formally apologized to the Michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; for almost three years.

==In-flight repair==


On the third EVA of the mission, two areas on the underside of the shuttle where photographic surveying identified protruding gap fillers were dealt with. According to NASA, the gap fillers, which each serve different purposes, are not required for reentry. One filler prevents &quot;chattering&quot; of tiles during ascent, which would occur due to the shock waves from the noses of the solid rocket boosters and the external fuel tank. The other, in a different location where there is a wider gap between tiles, simply functions to reduce the gap size between tiles, which in turn reduces heat transfer to the shuttle. Even without this filler NASA did not expect the increased heat to cause a problem during reentry (it is present to avoid a level of heating which would only be problematic if experienced many times over a vehicle&#x27;s design life). Since the gap fillers are not necessary for re-entry, it was acceptable to simply pull them out. An overview of the situation, including procedures for dealing with the protrusions, were sent electronically to the crew and printed aboard the shuttle. The crew were also able to watch uploaded videos of NASA personnel on the ground demonstrating the repair techniques. Both the videos and 12-page procedure document were also made publicly available via NASA&#x27;s website.

During the third EVA, both fillers were successfully removed with less than a pound of force and without the need to use any tools. Stephen K. Robinson gave a running commentary of his work: &quot;I&#x27;m grasping it and I&#x27;m pulling it and it&#x27;s coming out very easily&quot; ... &quot;It looks like this big patient is cured&quot;.

If it was not possible to pull the fillers out, then the protruding sections could have been simply cut off. The gap fillers were made of a cloth impregnated with ceramic – they were stiff and could be easily cut with a tool similar to a hacksaw blade. Protruding gap fillers were a problem because they disrupted the normally laminar air flow under the orbiter during reentry, causing turbulence at lower speeds. A turbulent air flow would result in a mixing of hot and cold air, which could have a major effect on the shuttle temperature.

The decision to make the repair balanced the risks of the EVA with the risks of leaving the protruding gap fillers as they were. It is thought that gap filler protrusions of a similar magnitude were present on previous missions, but were not observed in-orbit. Consideration was also given to the risks of elements of the procedure which would involve the ISS arm being used to carry Stephen K. Robinson below the shuttle, possibly the use of a sharp tool which had the potential to damage the EVA suit or shuttle tiles. The possibility of making things worse by attempting a repair was given serious consideration. Cameras on the shuttle arm and on Robinson&#x27;s helmet were used to monitor the activities under the shuttle.

Protruding gap fillers had been identified as an issue on previous flights, notably STS-28. A post-flight analysis identified that a gap filler was the likely cause of the high temperatures observed during this re-entry. Protruding gap fillers were also seen on STS-73.

A further in-flight repair was considered to remove or clip a damaged thermal blanket located beneath the commander&#x27;s window on the port side of the orbiter. Wind tunnel testing by NASA determined that the thermal blanket was safe for re-entry, and plans for a fourth spacewalk were cancelled.

==Wake-up calls==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

==Crew salute to Husband family==
On flight day 10, the entire STS-114 crew, and the crew of Expedition 11 gathered to wish Rick Husband&#x27;s son Matthew a happy birthday. Rick Husband was the commander of &quot;Columbia&quot; on STS-107.

==Mission hardware==

*SSME 1: 2057
*SSME 2: 2054
*SSME 3: 2056
*External Tank: ET-121
*SRB Set: BI-125
*RSRM Set: 92

==Contingency planning==

Since the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; in STS-107, it had been suggested that on future shuttle missions there would be a planned rescue capability involving having a second shuttle ready to fly at short notice. Even prior to the sensor problem causing the delay in the launch, a rescue option (called STS-300 by NASA) had been planned, which involved the crew of STS-114 remaining docked at the International Space Station until &quot;Atlantis&quot; could be launched with a four-person crew to retrieve the astronauts. &quot;Discovery&quot; would then be ditched by remote control over the Pacific Ocean, with &quot;Atlantis&quot; bringing back both its own crew, as well as that of &quot;Discovery&quot;.

A further option for rescue would be to use Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Nikolay Sevastyanov, director of the Russian Space Corporation Energia, was reported by &quot;Pravda&quot; as saying: &quot;If necessary, we will be able to bring home nine astronauts on board three Soyuz spacecraft in January and February of the next year&quot;.

<text>Richard Furman Reeves (November 28, 1936 – March 25, 2020) was an American writer, syndicated columnist, and lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

==Life and career==
Reeves was born in 1936 in New York City, the son of Dorothy (Forshay), an actress, and Furman W. Reeves, a judge in Hudson County, New Jersey. He received his Mechanical Engineering degree from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1960. After graduation, he spent a year working as an engineer for Ingersoll-Rand, after which he moved to journalism. From 1961–1965, Reeves co-founded and worked for the &quot;Phillipsburg Free Press&quot; (New Jersey), then worked for &quot;Newark Evening News&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; before being assigned the post of Chief Political Correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1966. In 1971, Reeves left the &quot;Times&quot; to lecture at Hunter College.

The opinions of Reeves generally had a liberal bent—he opposed the war to topple Saddam Hussein as &quot;stupid and unnecessary&quot; (column, March 19, 2003)—but shunned &quot;extreme&quot; leftist positions. He paid close attention to happenings overseas and often filled his columns with explanations of current trends based on history. Many of his columns focused on the world&#x27;s reaction to political actions of the United States.

He also published nine books, mostly about American politics. In 1993, he appeared in the film &quot;Dave&quot;, one of several journalists who played themselves in the film.

Reeves&#x27; weekly column, carried by Universal Press Syndicate, appeared in more than 160 newspapers across the United States after 1979. He also wrote a monthly column from Paris in Travel and Leisure magazine.

He was married to Catherine O&#x27;Neill, founder of the Women&#x27;s Commission for Women and Children Refugees. Together they had five children and divided their time between Los Angeles and New York City.

In October 2004 in an article entitled &quot;To begin with, the President is a fool&quot;, he shared his belief that John Kerry would win the 2004 presidential election. In the article, Reeves indicated that he voted absentee for the Democrat. He then shared his bias by saying: &quot;Biased? Of course. That&#x27;s why I write this column: to share my bias. I am always amazed when I get letters, many of them, accusing me of being a &#x27;liberal&#x27; or, a lot worse, an &#x27;elitist.&#x27; Yes, I am. Hello!&quot;

In November 2005, Reeves stated that George W. Bush could be regarded as the worst president in U.S. history, noting: &quot;The History News Network at George Mason University has just polled historians informally on the Bush record. Four hundred and fifteen, about a third of those contacted, answered, making the project as unofficial as it was interesting. These were the results: 338 said they believed Bush was failing, while 77 said he was succeeding. Fifty said they thought he was the worst president ever.&quot;

Reeves died on March 25, 2020, in Los Angeles from cardiac arrest.

<doc id="544497" wikidata="Q2164812" url="?curid=544497" title="Samhain (band)">
<text>Samhain was an American rock band formed by singer Glenn Danzig in 1983, immediately following his departure from The Misfits. Glenn Danzig originally planned Samhain as a side project with Eerie Von. After the Misfits&#x27; contentious 1983 dissolution, Samhain became Danzig&#x27;s full-time band.

Samhain catalogs a transitional period in Glenn Danzig&#x27;s musical career, bridging the gap between the punk rock/horror punk of the Misfits and the dark, heavy metal- and blues-influenced sound of Danzig. Samhain&#x27;s lyrics were much darker than those of the Misfits, with themes rooted in paganism and the occult and eventually the horrors of reality, as opposed to the sometimes cartoonish ghouls and ghosts of the Misfits.

Both Samhain and its successor, Danzig, use the same horned skull image originally drawn by artist Michael Golden for the cover of the 1984 comic book &quot;The Saga of Crystar&quot; No. 8, published by Marvel Comics. The font often used in the wordmarks of Samhain, and later Danzig, is taken from the film &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot;. Danzig took the name of the band from the Irish month of November and pre-Christian, Celtic festival Samhain, the origin of the modern Halloween. Despite the festival being pronounced &quot;sau-win&quot;, the band&#x27;s name is often pronounced as &quot;sam-hane&quot;. Glenn Danzig has said that both pronunciations are correct.

Samhain released two full-length albums and one EP during their three-year career as an active band. Danzig has said that he wrote two songs (&quot;Death Comes Ripping&quot; and &quot;Bloodfeast&quot;) with the intention of using them on the first Samhain album, but instead recorded them with the Misfits for the &quot;Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood&quot; album in order to round out that band&#x27;s final series of recordings and release a full album.

== History ==
=== Original run (1983–1990) ===
Samhain&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Initium&quot;, was released on lead singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s independent record label, Plan 9, in August 1984. In various interviews Danzig states that the album&#x27;s title, which translates from Latin to English as &quot;beginning&quot;, represents his new start after disbanding his prior band, The Misfits, in 1983. Most of the final track, &quot;Archangel&quot;, was actually recorded in March 1981, and was originally meant to either be a Misfits song featuring Dave Vanian (who never did vocals for the song) or a track for the band The Damned. The track &quot;Horror Biz&quot; likewise dates to Danzig&#x27;s Misfits era, as it is a new version of &quot;Horror Business&quot; with different musical arrangements. The album was recorded at Reel Platinum studio in Lodi, New Jersey, excluding the introduction which was recorded at Eerie Von&#x27;s home on a four track cassette.

In 1985, Samhain released their only EP, &quot;Unholy Passion&quot;. That next year, they released their second studio album titled &quot;Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire&quot;. The album contains a re-recorded version of the Misfits&#x27; &quot;Halloween II&quot;. AllMusic wrote that the album &quot;continues to be an influence for both punk and thrash bands&quot;. The track &quot;Mother of Mercy&quot; was featured in the 2009 video game &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;. Metallica co-founder James Hetfield lists &quot;November-Coming-Fire&quot; as one of his top ten albums of all time.

In 1986, Samhain was signed by Rick Rubin to his Def Jam Recordings label. Rubin at first wished only to sign Danzig. He had hoped to assemble a &quot;super-group&quot; with the talented vocalist at the center, but Danzig refused and also refused to agree to the record deal unless bassist Eerie Von could remain in the group. Rubin and Danzig agreed, however, that the band&#x27;s sound should be taken in a different direction, and so guitarist Damien Marshall was replaced by John Christ. Sometime in 1987, Danzig decided to change the name of Samhain to match his surname, Danzig, a move that would prevent him from ever again having to start anew, regardless of lineup changes. When London May was replaced with Chuck Biscuits on drums, Samhain officially ceased to exist, and the first Danzig lineup was complete, which then prompted the band to sign to Def American Recordings in 1988.

In 1990, Samhain&#x27;s final album, &quot;Final Descent&quot;, was released. Material for the album was completed in stages from 1986 to 1990, with one song (&quot;Death... in its Arms&quot;) recorded by the band Danzig, including drummer Chuck Biscuits (who had never been a member of Samhain) during the sessions for &quot;Danzig II: Lucifuge&quot;. On all other tracks, a drum machine was used. As much of the material for &quot;Final Descent&quot; was intended for a planned &quot;Samhain Grim&quot; album, its sound and songwriting bridges the gap between 1986&#x27;s &quot;November Coming Fire&quot; and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Danzig&quot;. In its first pressings, &quot;Final Descent&quot; also featured new remixed versions of the then out-of-print &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; EP. Possibly to avoid potential legal disputes with former guitarist Damien Marshall, Danzig had overdubbed/re-recorded all of the original guitar tracks with his own guitar playing. He also created a new track, a remix of the bass and vocal tracks from &quot;I Am Misery&quot;, entitled &quot;Misery Tomb&quot;.

When the Samhain box set was released in 2000, these remixes were given a CD of their own, taking the place of the original &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; EP, while the backend of &quot;Final Descent&quot; was filled out with four unreleased &quot;Samhain Grim&quot; era tracks, all featuring London May on drums. Among these were earlier, more abrasive arrangements of the eventual Danzig classics &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; and &quot;Possession&quot;, a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Trouble&quot; (later re-recorded for the 1993 Danzig EP &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot;), and a faster version of &quot;Lords of the Left Hand&quot;.

=== Reunions (1999–2014) ===
The band briefly reunited in November 1999 to celebrate the release of the Samhain box set. They went on one national tour with the band Danzig headlining. The lineup consisted of Danzig, Zing, May, and then Danzig guitarist Todd Youth. Marshall was initially asked to play guitar, but couldn&#x27;t as he was already on tour with Iggy Pop.

Samhain would reunite again in October 2011 and 2012 as part of a series of shows called the Danzig Legacy performances. The shows consisted of a set from Danzig, Samhain, and a set of Misfits songs with Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. Both London May and Steve Zing were part of this reunion.

Samhain reunited for the fourth time to play Riot Fest in September 2014. At that show, they played their debut album &quot;Initium&quot; in its entirety. The band also played a series of West Coast and East Coast shows from September to November. Peter Adams of the bands Baroness and Valkyrie handled guitar duties.

Another partial reunion took place in 2011 on the &quot;Danzig Legacy&quot; television special during a set of Samhain songs; &quot;Samhain&quot;, and &quot;To Walk the Night&quot;. The lineup remained the same with London May and Steve Zing sharing bass and drum duties, and with Tommy Victor playing guitar.

== Style ==
Samhain has been classified as death rock, horror punk, heavy metal, and gothic rock, among others. Their style was described by AllMusic as a fusion of punk and heavy metal with elements of &quot;goth&quot;.

Sometimes, Glenn Danzig could be seen donning a horned leather S&amp;M mask, and occasionally he and his bandmates went onstage covered in faux blood. Danzig would play guitar on live performances of the song &quot;Archangel&quot;, while the regular guitarist strapped on a bass guitar to perform a second bassline.
