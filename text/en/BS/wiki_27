<text>The ninth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, titled with a set of five unpronounceable, non-alphabetic symbols and commonly known as Symbols, was released on 23 September 1997 by Wax Trax! Records. Officially referred to as simply self-titled &#x27;KMFDM&#x27; in some media markets.

==Background==
Recorded in Seattle, &quot;Symbols&quot; marked the introduction of Tim Skold. While his contribution to this album was as a guest, he would become a full-fledged member for &quot;Adios&quot; and &quot;Attak&quot;. Sascha Konietzko, the frontman of KMFDM, said the title had no special meaning, and was just an idea for a title the group had very early on, before a single album had been released. En Esch said the idea for the album title came from the symbols used for curses in comic books. The symbols appear in the printed lyrics of &quot;Down and Out&quot;; the corresponding point in the song is covered with a censor-like beep in the song, and is replaced with &quot;(SYMBOLS)&quot; on the official KMFDM lyrics archive.
Several song files had been purportedly wiped clean during a computer malfunction late in the recording stage, essentially leading to most of the songs having to be re-done basically from scratch.

==Release==
&quot;Symbols&quot; was released on 23 September 1997. &quot;Megalomaniac&quot;, &quot;Anarchy&quot;, and &quot;Leid und Elend&quot; were included on the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Test Drive 5&quot;. &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; was also featured in the film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, and was the first single from its soundtrack. &quot;Anarchy&quot; appeared on the European version of the soundtrack to the 1998 film &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

==Reception==

Andy Hinds of AllMusic gave a mixed review, calling some of the band&#x27;s ideas repetitive while praising the programming. He also commented that the band keeps its sound fresh by bringing in new contributing artists for each new album, and noted the presence of Tim Skold and Nivek Ogre. He called the production top quality and the album &quot;a fine place for newcomers to start,&quot; but said that &quot;Symbols&quot; offers people that have been following the band few surprises. Kevin Williams of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; an &quot;incredible, irresistible opener&quot; and said the album &quot;could result in a KMFDM takeover of electronica.&quot;

&quot;Stray Bullet&quot; received significant media attention after the Columbine High School Massacre due to the song&#x27;s lyrics being posted on the website of one of the shooters, Eric Harris, before the massacre. The song was also played in the background of the final video posted by Pekka-Eric Auvinen on YouTube before the Jokela school shooting in Finland.

<doc id="541067" wikidata="Q5187700" url="?curid=541067" title="Crone">
<text>In folklore, a crone is an old woman who may be characterized as disagreeable, malicious, or sinister in manner, often with magical or supernatural associations that can make her either helpful or obsolete. The Crone is also an archetypical figure or a Wise Woman. As a character type, the crone shares characteristics with the hag.

The word became further specialized as the third aspect of the Triple Goddess popularized by Robert Graves and subsequently in some forms of neopaganism. In Wicca, the crone symbolizes the &quot;Dark Goddess&quot;, the dark side of the Moon, the end of a cycle; together with the &quot;Mother&quot; (Light Goddess) and the &quot;Maiden&quot; (Day Goddess), she represents part of the circle of life. The archetype of the &quot;Handsome Warlock&quot;, good or bad, may change a Crone or Hag to normal looks, if so desired.

==In some feminist circles==
In feminist spiritual circles, a &quot;Croning&quot; is a ritual rite of passage into an era of wisdom, freedom, and personal power.

According to scholar Clarissa Pinkola Estés, the Crone is &quot;the one who sees far, who looks into the spaces between the worlds and can literally see what is coming, what has been, and what is now and what underlies and stands behind many things. [...] The Crone represents the ability to see, more than just with one’s eyes alone, but to see with the heart’s eyes, with the soul’s eyes, through the eyes of the creative force and the animating force of the psyche.&quot;

==In folklore ==
The crone, along with many other female monsters is present in many cultures to warn of the nature of women. The crone highlights the importance of beauty and youth among women, and how older and elderly women often turned bitter and evil in their old age. In media, the crone often acts out of jealousy, luring young pretty women into bad situations, such as seen in the tale &quot;Snow White&quot;.

==Etymology==
As a noun, &quot;crone&quot; entered the English language around the year 1390, deriving from the Anglo-French word &quot;carogne&quot; (an insult), itself deriving from the Old North French &quot;charogne&quot;, &quot;caroigne&quot;, meaning a disagreeable woman (literally meaning &quot;carrion&quot;). Prior to the entrance of the word into English, the surname Hopcrone is recorded (around 1323–1324).

In more modern usage, &quot;crone&quot; is also defined as a &quot;woman who is venerated for experience, judgment, and wisdom.&quot;

Clarissa Pinkola Estes suggests that the word &quot;crone&quot; may derive from the word crown (or, la corona). While a crown is known as a circlet that goes around the head and establishes one&#x27;s authority as a leader, &quot;before this understanding, the crown, la corona, was understood to mean the halo of light around a person’s body. La corona was considered to shine more brightly when a person was clear, filled with love and justice.&quot; Thus, Estes suggests, the Crone is one who reflects this enhanced degree of clarity and in/sight.

==Examples==

In Norse myth, Thor wrestles the crone Elli who personifies old age.

In the local folklore of Somerset in South West England, the Woman of the Mist is said to appear sometimes as a crone gathering sticks; sightings of her were reported as late as the 1950s. In the Scottish Highlands tale &quot;The Poor Brother and the Rich&quot;, a crone refuses to stay buried, until her son-in-law provides a generous wake, after which he becomes as wealthy as his more fortunate brother.

In Cuban traditional folklore old women often appear as helpful characters, as in the tale of the sick man who cannot get well until he meets an old woman who advises him to wear the tunic of a man who is truly happy. According to writer Alma Flor Ada, &quot;They tend to be the ones who keep the family together, who pass on the traditions, who know the remedies that would cure the different illnesses&quot;.

<text>Affiliated with the University of Toronto, the Toronto School of Theology (TST) is an ecumenical consortium of seven theological colleges. Its seven member schools are Emmanuel College, Knox College, Regis College, St. Augustine&#x27;s Seminary, University of St. Michael&#x27;s College Faculty of Theology, Trinity College Faculty of Divinity, and Wycliffe College.

Academic standards are consistent with those of the University of Toronto, which holds TST accountable through a highly developed process of quality assurance.

The Toronto School of Theology is the largest ecumenical consortium for theological education in Canada. The TST consortium offers professional and academic degrees, for different educational purposes. Some are primarily professional in character, while others are oriented to general theological studies or research. All degree programs operate at the post-baccalaureate level, and degrees are conferred conjointly by the University of Toronto.

==History==

In 1944, the Toronto Graduate School of Theological Studies (TGSTS) was formed to promote collaboration in the Doctor of Theology and Master of Theology programs at Emmanuel, Knox, Trinity, and Wycliffe Colleges. In 1964, the TGSTS was incorporated and this year is considered the official year when the current Toronto School of Theology was established. In 1966, the Graduate Theological Division of St. Michael&#x27;s College joined TGSTS.

During 1969-70, the success of this venture led to the foundation of the current Toronto School of Theology (TST). Regis College and St. Augustine&#x27;s Seminary entered into the consortium as member schools, and collaboration began in two professional programs, the MDiv and the MRE, supplementing the cooperation that already existed in the ThD and ThM programs. TST was incorporated in April 1970, by an amendment to the Letters Patent of the TGSTS.

In 1978, TST and its member schools entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the University of Toronto, making possible the conjoint granting of degrees in theology by the University and the member schools of TST. TST committed itself to the University&#x27;s academic standards, and began appointing the University&#x27;s representatives to its Board of Trustees, its academic councils, and its faculty appointments committees. Finally, in 1979 a Memorandum of Agreement with the University of Toronto made it possible for the member schools to grant conjoint basic and advanced degrees in theology.

The Toronto School of Theology&#x27;s Arms and Flag were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on March 1, 2001. The school&#x27;s motto is the Greek word (), which is taken from 2 Corinthians 6:1 and means &quot;We work together with Him&quot; (or more loosely translates to &quot;Co-worker&quot;).

==Member Institutions==
The Toronto School of Theology consists of seven member theological schools and is the largest ecumenical consortium for theological education in Canada.

&quot;The Toronto Journal of Theology&quot; is published semi-annually. It promotes progressive publication of current opinion on the full range of scholarship represented by diverse Christian traditions through the analysis of issues in Biblical Studies, History of Christianity, Systematic and Pastoral Theology, and Christian Ethics and engagement of cross-cultural perspectives in discussing theological issues.

<text>The UBC Botanical Garden is a botanical garden located on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver, British Columbia. It maintains a documented living collection of temperate plants for the purposes of education, research, conservation, community outreach, and public display. Established in 1916, it is the oldest botanical garden at a university in Canada.

It is a member of the Canadian Garden Council, American Public Gardens Association, Botanic Gardens Conservation International, and the Plant Collections Network.

==History==
John Davidson, or Botany John, was appointed British Columbia&#x27;s first provincial botanist in 1911. He was given two assignments: complete a botanical survey of the province&#x27;s flora and establish a botanical garden and herbarium. Davidson first established an arboretum, nursery, and botanical garden on the hospital lands of Essondale in Coquitlam with the assistance of the patients. 

The government then set aside two acres of land (0.8 ha) at the Provincial Colony Farm in Essondale (later called Riverview) near New Westminster for the establishment of the first botanical garden. After the closure of the Office of the Provincial Botanist in 1916, the botanical garden relocated to the UBC campus in West Point Grey. This involved the transport of thousands of perennials and shrubs across forty kilometres of rough roads to the new location.

At UBC, the garden&#x27;s original site was at the &quot;Old Arboretum&quot;. All that remains of it today are the trees planted in 1916 by John Davidson. The old arboretum is now home to many buildings including the First Nations House of Learning. 

In 1951, the entire UBC campus was designated as a botanical garden. The head of the Botany Department, Dr. T.M.C. (Tommy) Taylor, was appointed the Garden Director.

After several years of changing scope and mandate, eventually in 1966 land was set aside near Thunderbird Stadium on the south end of the University campus for a stand-alone botanical garden. Dr. Roy Taylor was hired as the first director of UBC Botanical Garden at its current site.

==Features==
The garden measures approximately 44 hectares (440,000 m2 / 110 acres) and includes a curated collection of 120,000 accessions representing over 6000 taxa with a significant collection of Magnolia, Acer (plant), Sorbus (mountain ash, Styracaceae (storax family), Rhododendron and climbing plants. Visitors to the garden can expect to spend a minimum of one hour exploring the various areas of the garden. 
*David C. Lam Asian Garden, a coastal native second-growth forest under-planted with Asian plants.
*E.H. Lohbrunner Alpine Garden, contains mountainous plants from around the world organized into geographic areas.
*BC Rainforest Garden, showcasing elements of the coastal rainforest of southwestern BC and the southern interior wet-belt.
*Carolinian Forest Garden, represents an eastern North American deciduous hardwood forest.
*Food Garden, contains edible crops worked in a sustainable manner, using organic techniques.
*Harold and Frances Holt Physic Garden, represents the original botanical gardens built to educate physicians and apothecaries.
*Garry Oak Meadow and Woodland Garden, a threatened ecosystem showcasing biodiversity and First Nations influence.
*Greenheart Tree Walk, a 310-metre-long tree top canopy walkway that hangs from Douglas firs, cedars and grand firs, many of which are over 100 years old.

There is also a series of small gardens of special interest and naturalized areas that dot the grounds of UBC Botanical Garden, including: the Pacific Slope Garden, Arbour Garden, Winter Garden, Perennial Borders Garden, Grow Green Demonstration Area, Contemporary Garden, Cattail Marsh, Walk in the Woods Trail. 

UBC Botanical Garden also administers the Nitobe Memorial Garden, a traditional Japanese garden located on the north end of campus.

==Research==
In 2002, the UBC Centre for Plant Research became the research arm of the UBC Botanical Garden. The Centre for Plant Research examines topics such as plant adaptation, genomics and phytochemistry. The Botanical Garden and the Centre for Plant Research are both encompassed by UBC&#x27;s Faculty of Science.

==Education==
Since 2012, UBC Botanical Garden has offered an 8-month provincially accredited Horticulture Training Program (HTP). The full-time program, which runs from August-April, introduces students to, among other areas, principles and techniques of landscape construction and design, garden ecology, plant biology and health, the role of soil in natural and constructed landscapes, ornamental and food crop management, and hands-on landscape and garden management.

<doc id="541110" wikidata="Q2402520" url="?curid=541110" title="Java Metadata Interface">
<text>Given that metadata is a set of descriptive, structural and administrative data about a group of computer data (for example such as a database schema), Java Metadata Interface (or JMI) is a platform-neutral specification that defines the creation, storage, access, lookup and exchange of metadata in the Java programming language.

== History ==

The JMI specification was developed under the Java Community Process and is defined by JSR 40 (a JSR is the formal document that describe proposed specifications and technologies for adding to the Java platform).

JMI is based on the Meta-Object Facility (or MOF) specification from the Object Management Group (or OMG). The MOF is a metamodel (a model of any kind of metadata) used notably to define the Unified Modeling Language (or UML).

It supports the exchange of metadata through XMI. XMI is a standard for exchanging metadata information via Extensible Markup Language (or XML). The MOF/XMI specifications are used for the exchange of UML models.

== Usage ==

Essentially, JMI can be used to write tools in Java for manipulating UML models, which can be used in Model Driven Architecture and/or Model Driven Development. There are many implementations of JMI, including the Reference Implementation from Unisys, SAP NetWeaver and Sun Microsystems&#x27;s open-source implementation from the NetBeans group. JMI is compatible with Java SE 1.3 and above through:
* Standardized mappings from the MOF modeling constructs to Java;
* Reflective APIs for generic discovery and navigation of metadata models and instances.

<text>Rosyth () is a town and Garden City in Fife, Scotland, on the coast of the Firth of Forth.

Scotland&#x27;s first Garden City, Rosyth is part of the Greater Dunfermline Area and is located 3 miles south of Dunfermline city centre and 10 miles northwest of Edinburgh city centre. To the west of Rosyth lies Limekilns and to the east lies Inverkeithing.

Rosyth was founded along with the finished construction of Rosyth Dockyard in March 1916, built as a naval base for World War I battleships to protect the North Sea. Rosyth played a key role in World War II defending the North Sea especially during the German occupation of Norway. It was then redeveloped to maintain submarines and serve as a port and business park.

Rosyth is near the narrowest crossing point of the Firth of Forth, so has long been strategically important, evidenced by the 15th century Rosyth Castle. Rosyth is home to 12 Historic Scotland listed buildings as well as sections of long distance footpaths the Fife Coastal Path and the Fife Pilgrim Way.

Today, Rosyth is a suburban commuter town of Edinburgh and Dunfermline. Rosyth Railway Station is on the Fife Circle Line and the town is bypassed by the M90 motorway. Rosyth has a population of 13,570 (2022), making the town the 5th largest in Fife.

==Governance==

Rosyth is within the Cowdenbeath constituency of the Scottish Parliament, currently held by Annabelle Ewing of the Scottish National Party, as well as the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region.

For the UK Parliament, Rosyth is located in the Dunfermline and Dollar constituency and is represented by Graeme Downie of the Labour Party, who won election in the 2024 General Election.

Rosyth has three representatives on Fife Council: Brian Goodall (Scottish National Party), Tony Jackson (Scottish National Party) and Andrew Verrecchia (Labour Party).

==Dockyard and Military==
Rosyth is best known for its large Naval Dockyard, formerly the Royal Naval Dockyard Rosyth. The town was planned as a garden city with accommodation for the construction workers and dockyard workers. Today, the dockyard is almost in size, a large proportion of which was reclaimed during construction.

Rosyth, Inverkeithing and nearby Charlestown were major centres of shipbreaking activity, notably the salvage of much of the German fleet scuttled at Gutter Sound, Scapa Flow, the Cunard Line&#x27;s RMS Mauretania, and the White Star Line&#x27;s RMS Olympic.

The associated military naval base closed in 1994, and no Royal Navy ships are &quot;permanently&quot; based at Rosyth, though some ships now return for docking and refit activities, including s and Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.

Rosyth&#x27;s dockyards became the first in the Royal Navy to be privatised when Babcock International acquired the site in 1987. The privatisation followed almost eighty years of contribution to the defence of the United Kingdom which spanned two World Wars and the Cold War with the Soviet Union, during which Rosyth became a key nuclear submarine maintenance establishment.

When the final submarine refit finished in 2003, a project to undertake early nuclear decommissioning of the submarine refit and allied facilities – Project RD83 – began pre-planning. The project was funded by Ministry of Defence, in accordance with the contractual agreement in place following the sale of the dockyard, but management and sub-contracting was the responsibility of the dockyard owner, Babcock Engineering Services. The main decommissioning sub-contractor was Edmund Nuttall Limited.

Work began in 2006 and was finished in 2010. The project completed ahead of programme and under-budget, which is unusual in nuclear decommissioning activities. Notably some nuclear liabilities do remain at Rosyth Dockyard.

The dockyard was the site for final assembly of the two s for the Royal Navy&#x27;s future carrier project.

=== Military installations ===
A number of Ministry of Defence establishments and military bases are located both in and around the Naval dockyard at Rosyth.

In November 2016 the UK Government announced that MoD Caledonia would close in 2022. On 1 April 2023 it was renamed HMS Caledonia and its future is assured.

There are Sea, Army and Air Cadets located in Rosyth. The Sea and Air cadets are located in the Naval Dockyard inside HMS Caledonia, whereas the Army cadets is located next to Park Road Primary School on Middlebank Street.

===International Links===

Starting in 2002, an overnight ferry service linked Rosyth with Zeebrugge in Belgium. This service was discontinued by Superfast Ferries in September 2008, but recommenced in May 2009 under new operator Norfolkline. They ran three sailings a week in each direction.

Norfolkline was taken over by DFDS Seaways, who subsequently reduced the service to freight-only, three sailings a week in each direction. The service was terminated in 2018 following a fire aboard one of the ships.

In June 2022, it was reported that talks were underway to restore the ferry route, with DFDS operating a freight service from early 2023, with passenger service expected by summer 2023, however as of 2024 this is yet to start.

== Building Rosyth ==
The fifteenth century Rosyth Castle stands on the perimeter of the dockyard complex, at the entry to the ferry terminal, and was once surrounded by the Firth of Forth on almost all sides, until land reclamation by the docks in the early 1900s.

The Scottish National Housing Company (SNHC) was a public utility company set up in 1915 to provide houses for employees at Rosyth naval dockyard; shares were taken by Dunfermline town council with the Public Works Loan Board lending the money. Work on building housing for the dockyard workers had been delayed due to disagreements between the Admiralty and Dunfermline council about who should take financial responsibility (1909–15). Some workers were accommodated in temporary huts called East and West Bungalow village and nicknamed &#x27;tin town&#x27;.

From the first proposals for a new settlement at Rosyth, it was suggested it should be developed along Garden City lines. The town planning scheme was passed in 1915 and the first houses were occupied in 1916. Raymond Unwin was appointed advisor to the Admiralty. Rosyth became the largest of the permanent First World War housing schemes in Scotland. Unwin&#x27;s assistant Alfred Hugh Mottram worked on the layout and became the SNHC&#x27;s main architect, designing over 1,400 cottage-style houses. Mottram also designed the B-listed Rosyth Parish Church (1930).
==Economic redevelopment==

Scottish Enterprise Fife is now working in partnership with various private sector organisations to explore the future development of Rosyth. The agency is looking at ways to expand the ferry services to other European and domestic ports. It also wants to help create new business infrastructure in and around Rosyth – which in turn will bring economic benefits to Fife and beyond.

The main dock area – operated by Forth Ports – is ripe for further development. Since opening in 1997, the port has seen rising timber and cargo vessels use the facility. Its warehouse and logistics facilities make an ideal choice for exporters and importers.

A private developer owned site was developed into an £80 million business park – called Rosyth Europarc. More than of office and hi-tech manufacturing have already been developed. Companies like Intelligent Finance and Bank of Scotland are on site. To complement these developments, a new £8.4 million road was built to provide an enhanced link to the nearby M90 motorway.

== Transport ==
The M90 motorway and A823(M) motorway bypass the town which link Rosyth to Dunfermline, Perth, and Kinross to the north, as well as South Queensferry and Edinburgh to the south.

The main road going through Rosyth is the A985 road which links the town with Inverkeithing, Dalgety Bay to the east as well as the Kincardine Bridge to the west which links the town to Falkirk, Stirling and Glasgow.

There are plans to build a new &quot;Park and Choose&quot; facility in Rosyth next to Rosyth railway station which would allow more bus and train connections as well as take pressure off of Halbeath in Dunfermline and Ferrytoll in Inverkeithing&#x27;s Park and ride bus stations. It could potentially bring new routes to Rosyth and increase passengers.

=== Train Connections ===

There is one Train Station in Rosyth in the extreme north of the town - Rosyth railway station. It is a part of the Fife Circle Line and mainly serves two train routes towards:

* Glenrothes with Thornton (Stopping in Dunfermline City, Dunfermline Queen Margaret, Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly, and Cardenden)
* Edinburgh Waverley (Stopping in Inverkeithing, North Queensferry, Dalmeny, Edinburgh Gateway, South Gyle, and Haymarket).
* Once a day near midnight (Except on Sundays when it is at 7:23pm), there is a train towards Perth (which stops in the same stops as the Glenrothes route as well as Markinch and Ladybank)

=== Bus Connections ===
There are bus connections connecting Rosyth with various places in Scotland.

East Scotland Stagecoach Bus connections:
* X51 to Dunfermline - X51 to Livingston
* X52 to Dunfermline - X52 to Edinburgh 
* X55 to Dunfermline - X55 to Edinburgh

There are Ember Coach busses running all day and all night to Dundee (stops in Kinross, Bridge of Earn and Perth) and Edinburgh including the terminal at Edinburgh Airport at night, during the day it stops at Ingliston Park and Ride and includes a free one stop tram to the airport terminal with the ticket. As of November 2024, a new service between Aberdeen and Edinburgh opened linking the town directly to Aberdeen with stops being the same as the Dundee route and additionally; Forfar, Brechin, Drumlithie, Newtonhill, and Portlethen.

==Education==

There are 4 Primary Schools currently located inside Rosyth as well as a Fife College Campus inside the Dockyard area of Rosyth.

Primary Schools located inside Rosyth:
*Park Road Primary School
*King&#x27;s Road Primary School
*Camdean Primary School
*St John&#x27;s RC Primary School

Currently students from these schools go into Inverkeithing High School after Primary 7, but starting August 2026, students will start to go to the new Rosyth / South West Fife High School which is currently under construction.

There is also a special education school located in the Dockyard called The Bridges Centre.

=== Rosyth / South West Fife High School ===

On 11 July 2024, construction for a future high school started in Caledonia Heights, Rosyth to replace the 50 year old Inverkeithing High School in the neighbouring town of Inverkeithing. It is planned to open to students by August 2026. The current name for the school is South West Fife High School however, this could change. It is projected to be able to handle 1,735 students which is more than Inverkeithing High School has enrolled. The school will likely teach students from Rosyth, Inverkeithing, Hillend, Dalgety Bay, North Queensferry, Aberdour, High Valleyfield, and also from Southern Dunfermline.

==Sports==

The town has a rugby union club, Rosyth Sharks, which play in the league and a football club Rosyth FC that plays in the East of Scotland Football League.

<doc id="541128" wikidata="Q989470" url="?curid=541128" title="Clan (video games)">
<text>In video games, a clan, community, guild, or faction is an organized group of video game players that regularly play together in one or more multiplayer games. Many clans take part in gaming competitions, but some clans are just small gaming squads consisting of friends.

Squads range from groups of a few friends to four-thousand plus person organizations, with a broad range of structures, goals and members. The lifespan of a clan also varies considerably, from a few weeks to over a decade. Numerous clans exist for nearly every online game available today, notably in first-person shooters (FPS), massively multiplayer games (MMO), role-playing video games (RPG), and strategy games. There are also meta-groups that span a wide variety of games. Some clans formed by groups of players have grown into multi-million dollar professional esports teams.

Many clans on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and personal computers have official clan websites with forums to interact and discuss many topics with the rest of their clan. They offer in-clan awards and medals for clan achievements ranging from time in the clan to wins and contributions to the group like donations and prizes for giveaways. The terms &quot;alliance&quot; and &quot;team&quot; are also used for this purpose in, e.g., Illyriad or Freeciv.

==In first-person shooters==
As the first-person shooter (FPS) genre became increasingly popular, the idea of a competitive clan became widely accepted. Clans became teams, or elite clan members form teams to represent the clan in online battle. FPS clans normally host servers with rules that they like. For instance if a group of gamers like to use pistols only they could join a clan that runs a pistols only server and the clan would enforce the rules.

==In role-playing games==
Clans also exist in other genres, where they are often referred to by a different name and serve a purpose more suited to the game. Many massively multiplayer online (MMO) and role-playing video games (RPGs) tend to call them &quot;guilds&quot; or invent their own term. Examples of this include Star Wars Galaxies (&quot;player associations&quot;) and &quot;EVE Online&quot; (&quot;corporations&quot;). EVE Online is also notable for having defined the system in more detail than is common in most MMOs, with &quot;alliances&quot; being structured collections of corporations such that a corporation may have a dedicated role within the alliance to which it belongs. The final form of community in EVE Online is known as a Coalition, which is a grouping of multiple alliances. This third-tier arrangement isn&#x27;t supported by the game software as such; instead, coalitions are purely player driven creations. 
In the superhero-based game &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, they are called &quot;supergroups&quot;, and are similar in structure to comic book hero organizations like the X-Men. In Final Fantasy XI, such clans are called &quot;linkshells&quot; and players of the game have the tendency and ability to be in more than one at once. Final Fantasy XIV also shares the same system for Linkshells as Final Fantasy XI but also with the addition of &quot;Free Companies&quot; which allow for the more traditional form of Clan and Guild system seen in most MMORPG games.

==In simulation games==
Many simulation games, such as those in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series, have clans that follow similar patterns to other genres. Notable types of simulation clans include virtual airlines (VAs) and Virtual Military Organizations (VMOs). A virtual airline is a dedicated hobby organization that uses flight simulation to model the operations of an airline. VAs generally have a presence on the Internet, similar to a real airline. The &quot;Pilot Career Guide&quot;, published in 1999, estimated that there were over 100 Professional Pilot Career Guide VAs of significance, with tens of thousands of participants at any one time.

<text>The Lincoln Town Car is a model line of full-size luxury sedans that was marketed by the Lincoln division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company. Deriving its name from a limousine body style, Lincoln marketed the Town Car from 1981 to 2011, with the nameplate previously serving as the flagship trim of the Lincoln Continental. Produced across three generations for thirty model years, the Town Car was marketed directly against luxury sedans from Cadillac and Chrysler.

Marketed nearly exclusively as a four-door sedan (a two-door sedan was offered for 1981 only), many examples of the Town Car were used for fleet and livery (limousine) service. From 1983 to its 2011 discontinuation, the Town Car was the longest car produced by Ford worldwide, becoming the longest mass-production car sold in North America from 1997 to 2011. While not a direct successor of the Town Car, the Lincoln MKS would become the longest American sedan until 2016 (overtaken by the Cadillac CT6).

From 1980 until 2007, the Lincoln Town Car was assembled in Wixom, Michigan, (Wixom Assembly) alongside the Lincoln Continental, LS, and Mark VI, VII, and VIII. After Wixom&#x27;s closure, Town Car production moved to Southwold, Ontario, (St. Thomas Assembly) alongside the similar Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis. The final Lincoln Town Car was produced on August 29, 2011.

Within the Lincoln model line, the Town Car was not directly replaced; the nameplate was used from 2012 to 2019 to denote livery/limousine/hearse variants of the Lincoln MKT. For 2017, the revived Continental replaced the MKS, closely matching the Town Car in wheelbase and width.

== Background ==

=== Etymology ===
In the 1920s, a town car was a body design typically used for limousines. The description originated from the horse-drawn carriage that featured an open chauffeur&#x27;s compartment with a fixed roof for the passengers. During that era, the fixed rear roof horse-drawn carriage became a limousine and the term &quot;de Ville&quot; in French meant &quot;for town (use)&quot;. In 1922, Edsel Ford purchased a custom-built Lincoln L-Series town car as a personal vehicle for his father, Henry Ford.

Later, the &quot;sedan de Ville&quot; was used as a model name by Cadillac, the primary rival to the Lincoln Continental from the 1950s to the 1990s.

=== Continental Town Car ===

==== 1959–1960 ====
For 1959, Lincoln augmented its pre-existing Continental lineup with the addition of two formal sedans known as the Town Car and Limousine. Both new vehicles featured pillared construction and interiors of broadcloth and scotch-grain leather as well as deep pile carpeting. No options were offered, all equipment including air conditioning being standard; the Limousine came with a glass partition between the front and rear seats.

In place of the reverse-slant roofline used by all other Continentals (including convertibles), the Town Car/Limousine was styled with a notchback roofline with a heavily padded vinyl top and an inset rear window. In addition to the slightly restrained styling, the change in the roofline was also functional. To add rear-seat legroom, the rear seat was repositioned without any modification to the wheelbase. In the years to follow, both Imperial and Cadillac would redesign the rooflines on their own range-topping vehicles (the LeBaron and Fleetwood Sixty-Special) to appear more formal and limousine-like.

One of the rarest vehicles ever produced by Ford Motor Company, 214 Town Cars and 83 Limousines were produced from 1959 until 1960; all were painted black.

==== 1970–1979 ====
For 1970, the Town Car name returned as a trim package option, including leather seating surfaces and deeper cut-pile carpeting. For 1971, a limited-edition (1500 produced) Golden Anniversary Continental Town Car commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Lincoln. For 1972, the Town Car was introduced as a sub-model of the Lincoln Continental model line. On nearly all examples, a vinyl top covered the rear half of the roof, with a full-length configuration optional. A raised molding over the roof incorporated coach lamps on the B-pillars. For 1973, Lincoln introduced a two-door variant of the Continental Town Car, named the Town Coupe. As with the Town Car, the Town Coupe included a standard vinyl roof.

As part of the 1975 redesign of the Lincoln roofline, the Town Car adopted the oval opera windows of the Mark IV coupe, with the Town Coupe given a large rectangular opera window.

The Continental Town Car proved to be a success for the division, becoming the most popular Lincoln vehicle of the 1970s (as the Mark IV and Mark V were not technically branded as Lincolns).

==== 1980 ====
For the 1980 model year, Lincoln became the final American brand to market downsized full-size cars. In its redesign, the Lincoln Continental shifted from the largest production sedan in North America to a design with a smaller exterior footprint than Cadillac. The Continental Town Car returned as the top trim for the Lincoln model range; in its own downsizing, the Mark series introduced the Continental Mark VI. Though technically not badged a Lincoln, the Mark VI shared its chassis and much of the body with the Continental to reduce development and production costs.

While Lincoln had brought downsized model lines to production, from a marketing standpoint, the consolidation of the Continental, Continental Town Car/Town Coupe, and the Mark VI proved catastrophic. Following the early 1980 withdrawal of the slow-selling Lincoln Versailles, Lincoln-Mercury dealers offered three highly similar vehicles across a wide price range in the same showroom. The discontinuation of the Versailles also marked the return of Lincoln exclusively to the full-size sedan segment, leaving nothing to sell against European-brand luxury vehicles.

For the 1981 model year, Lincoln underwent a revision to transition its full-size model range from three nameplates to one, commencing a multi-year transition throughout all three Ford divisions. For 1981, the Continental went on hiatus, with Lincoln shifting the nameplate to a mid-size sedan for 1982. The Mark VI ended its model cycle in 1983; for 1984, the Mark VII exited the full-size segment, shifting the Mark Series into a different market segment.

== First generation (1981–1989) ==

A model year removed from the extensive downsizing of its full-size model range, the Lincoln division underwent a revision of its nameplates. Following the discontinuation of the compact Versailles sedan, Lincoln was left marketing six nearly identical vehicles (Continental, Continental Town Car, and Continental Mark VI, all offered both as two-door and four-door sedans). For 1981, the Lincoln Town Car was introduced, consolidating the Continental and Continental Town Car into a single model line slotted below the Continental Mark VI.

Identical to the 1980 Lincoln Continental, the Lincoln Town Car was offered as a two-door and four-door sedan (the Town Coupe nameplate was discontinued). Largely overshadowed by its Continental Mark VI counterpart, the Town Car two-door was discontinued for 1982. As the Continental Mark VII was introduced for 1984, Lincoln pared its full-size line down solely to the Town Car four-door sedan.

At the time of its launch, the Town Car had been slated for replacement by front-wheel drive model lines (in anticipation of further volatility in fuel prices); as fuel prices began to stabilize, demand initially rose for the model line, leading Lincoln-Mercury to produce the Town Car through the 1980s with few visible changes. Over 200,000 were sold in 1988, the highest ever for the model line. However, this increase was mostly due to an extended 1988 Town Car model year which ran from March 1987 to October 1988 instead of the usual 12-month period. Conversely, the 1987 Town Car with its shortened model year only had sales of just over 76,000. Although remaining Lincoln&#x27;s top-selling model, calendar-year sales declined each year for the Town Car between 1986 and 1989. This decline was mostly blamed on its aging design and the increased popularity of the Continental which had been fully redesigned for 1988.

=== Chassis ===
The 1980–1989 Lincoln Continental/Town Car utilized the Panther platform shared with Ford and Mercury. Delayed to the 1980 model year due to engineering issues, the Panther platform meant radically different exterior dimensions for the Lincoln models. Although extended three inches in wheelbase over its Ford/Mercury/Mark VI coupe counterparts, the 1980-1989 versions would have the shortest wheelbase ever used for a full-size Lincoln at the time (10 inches shorter than its 1979 predecessor). The 1980 Continental/Town Car was the shortest Lincoln since the Versailles. In the interest of fuel economy and handling, the Panther chassis reduced weight by up to compared to the 1970-1979 full-size Lincolns. As the lightest full-size Lincoln in 40 years, the 1980 Continental/Town Car came within less than 200 pounds of the curb weight of the compact-sized Versailles. The new Panther platform meant reduced overall size, better suspension geometry, and upgraded power steering with a reduced turning diameter by over 8 feet (compared to the 1979 Lincoln Continental). For 1984, gas-pressurized shocks were added.

To achieve better Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) results, Ford discontinued the 400 and 460 big-block V8s in its full-size cars. For 1980, a 4.9 L V8 (the 302 engine was marketed as a &quot;5.0 L&quot; V8) was standard. A V8 was available as an option. Following the introduction of the Lincoln Town Car in 1981, the V8 became the only available engine (with the 351 becoming an option for Ford and Mercury). In Canada, the 302 V8 remained carbureted until 1985. In 1986, the 302 V8 was revised to , following a redesign of the fuel-injection system with the introduction of sequential multi-port fuel injection. These engines are identifiable by their cast aluminum upper intake manifolds with a horizontal throttle body (vertical throttle plate); this replaced the traditional throttle body with a carburetor-style top-mounted air cleaner previously used. Introduced in the Lincoln Continental for 1980 and marketed in all Panther-platform vehicles in 1981, the Lincoln Town Car was equipped with the 4-speed AOD automatic overdrive transmission, the sole transmission of 1981–1989 examples.

All Town Cars from 1980 through 1989 were available with an optional trailer towing package that included dual exhausts, a 3.55:1 limited slip differential (code &#x27;K&#x27;) and an improved cooling package for the engine and transmission.

=== Body ===

==== Exterior ====
During the late 1970s, the sales of the Lincoln Continental had held steady and the Continental Mark V would go on to outsell its Cadillac Eldorado counterpart. In the development of the Lincoln Town Car, the design themes of the 1977-1979 Lincoln Continental and Mark V would both influence the exterior design of the 1980 Continental/Town Car. As with its predecessors, the Town Car featured nearly flat body sides, sharp-edged fenders, and a radiator-style grille. Hideaway headlamps gave way to exposed halogen headlamps (the first on a full-size Lincoln since 1969). Another first included fully framed door glass (retractable vent windows were now standard); in contrast to its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the window frames were painted matte black. While chrome trim remained around the headlamps and window frames, in a break from Lincoln tradition, it was deleted from the top of the fenders. Though mechanically similar to the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis (the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis after 1983), the Lincoln Town Car shared visible body panels only with the Continental Mark VI. In contrast to its Ford, Mercury, and Mark VI counterparts, the rooflines of 1981-1989 Town Cars feature a vertical quarter window in the C-pillar.

After only 4,935 two-door Town Cars were sold in 1981, the body style was discontinued for 1982. In the shift from rebadging the Continental to the Lincoln Town Car for 1981, Lincoln replaced the &quot;Continental&quot; badging above the headlights with &quot;Town Car&quot;, which was removed in 1984.

A padded roof was standard equipment on all Town Cars, with its design determined by trim level. On standard-trim Town Cars, a leather-grained vinyl full-length covering with center pillar coach lamps was fitted. For Signature Series and Cartier trims, a padded vinyl coach roof (covering the rear half of the roof) with a frenched (smaller) rear window opening was fitted; the coach roof was also an option on standard-trim Town Cars. On non-Cartier Town Cars, a full-length cloth (canvas) roof was an option; imitating the look of a convertible, the design deleted the C-pillar quarter windows.

During the 1980s, the Lincoln Town Car would undergo several exterior revisions. For 1985, the model was given a mid-cycle facelift. In addition to (slightly) improving its aerodynamics, the design was intended to visually shorten the car (though the length was essentially unchanged). The front and rear bumpers were redesigned, better integrating them into the bodywork. The rear fascia was redesigned; distinguished by redesigned taillamps, and the trunk lid was better integrated with the rear fenders. For 1986, to meet federal regulations, a center brake light was added in the rear window. For 1988, the grille was updated with a brushed-metal panel between the taillamps, which now featured the reverse lamps.

1989 models are distinguished by special trim features including satin black paint for grille blades, trim between headlights, and amber (instead of clear) front parking lamps. The &quot;Lincoln&quot; front-end badging is moved from above the left headlight onto the grille and changed to a large sans-serif script. In the rear, the brushed-metal panel was given a pinstripe finish and all badging was moved from the panel onto the trunk lid. All models feature a landau roof with a smaller, more formal &quot;frenched&quot; rear window. All non-Cartier models also include an embedded Lincoln &quot;star&quot; emblems in their opera windows

==== Interior ====
The interior of the Lincoln Town Car featured many advanced luxury options for its time. Signature Series and Cartier models featured 6-way power seats (and manual seatback recliners) for the driver and front passenger; the Lincoln Town Car adopted a split front bench seat previously seen on the Mark coupes. Several electronic features included an optional digital display trip computer showing the driver &quot;miles to empty&quot; and (based on driver input) an &quot;estimated time of arrival&quot;. Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad system, marketed as its &quot;Securicode&quot;, unlocked the vehicle through a 5-digit combination (factory-programmed or owner-programmed). Mounted above the driver&#x27;s door handle, the keypad allowed the driver to lock all four doors; after entering the code, the driver could unlock the doors or release the trunk lid. Along with keyfob-based systems, the keypad system is still in use on Ford and Lincoln vehicles (as of 2025).

As part of the 1985 update, the Lincoln Town Car was the first Ford vehicle to feature a CD player as an option (as part of a 12-speaker JBL premium stereo system); while 1984 was the final year for the option of 8-track players and CB radios for the Town Car. In a functional change, the horn button was moved from the turn-signal lever to the steering wheel hub. The door trim was changed from wood to upholstery matching the seats.

For 1986, the front-seat head restraints were replaced with a taller 4-way articulating design; walnut burl trim replaced much of the satin black trim on the lower dash. For 1988, the instrument cluster was updated; for Town Cars with analog gauges, the instrument panel was given round dials in square bezels. In addition, new wood trim was added to the dashboard and steering wheel.

=== Trim ===
At its 1980 launch, the Lincoln Town Car was offered in two trim levels, a standard/base trim and a Lincoln Town Car Signature Series (a name shared with the Mark VI, though with less exclusive features). In 1982, Lincoln adopted the Mark-Series tradition of Designer Series editions as the Cartier Edition was shifted from the Mark VI to the Town Car, becoming the top trim level; the Cartier Edition would remain part of the Town Car line through the 2003 model year.

==== Special editions ====
Cartier Designer Edition

In 1982, in a trim level shift, the Cartier Edition was moved from the Mark Series to the Lincoln Town Car. As before, the special-edition package consisted of exclusively coordinated exterior colors and interior designs, with the Cartier logo embroidered in place of the Lincoln &quot;star&quot; emblem on the seats. For 1987, the package underwent a redesign with a new upholstery design and new two-tone (metallic beige) platinum added alongside the traditional platinum silver and two-tone arctic white.

Sail America Commemorative EditionThis special edition 1987 Signature Series model came in white with a blue carriage roof and had a white leather interior with blue piping and special badging. Ford Motor Company was one of the corporate sponsors of the &quot;Sail America Foundation&quot; syndicate, and owner of the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup winning yacht &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes 87.&quot;

Special EditionThe 1988 Town Car Signature Series was available with a $2,461 (~$ in ) &#x27;Special Edition package&#x27;, which included a carriage roof (giving the appearance of a convertible top), wire-spoke aluminum wheels, JBL audio system, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and leather upholstery with contrasting-color piping. This replaced a proposed Gucci edition Town Car that had been in the works.

Gucci Edition1989 Signature Series Gucci Edition had a special blue canvas roof with fluorescent B-pillar light and a special blue badge on the C-pillar with the word signature. It was designated in the VIN as code 84.

=== Marketing ===
For the 1985 model year, the Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood, traditional competitors of the Lincoln Town Car, shifted to front-wheel drive platforms (although, the Fleetwood Brougham retained its rear-drive platform and styling). At the time, Lincoln marketed the larger size of the Town Car as a selling point. In response to the downsized Cadillacs, Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late 1985 titled &quot;The Valet&quot; which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser Buicks (Electras) and Oldsmobiles (Ninety-Eights), with the question &quot;Is that a Cadillac?&quot; answered by the response &quot;No, it&#x27;s an Oldsmobile...or Buick.&quot; At the end, the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line &quot;The Lincoln Town Car, please.&quot; The commercial campaign saw the emergence of a new advertising slogan for the brand, &quot;Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.&quot; which was used into the 1990s. The marketing campaign was unable to turn around declining Town Car sales. It was only after an all-new redesigned Town Car was introduced in 1989 for the 1990 model year that sales temporarily rebounded.

=== Production ===
== Second generation (FN36/116; 1990–1997) ==

After ten years on the market (nine of them as the Town Car) relatively unchanged, the Lincoln Town Car was given an extensive redesign inside and out, being launched on October 5, 1989, as a 1990 model. In a move to bring a new generation of buyers to the Lincoln brand, the Town Car adopted a far more contemporary image, bringing it in line with the Continental and Mark VII. In addition, the Town Car adopted a new range of safety and luxury features and would mark the debut of a powertrain that would see usage in a wide variety of Ford Motor Company vehicles. The Town Car was named the 1990 Motor Trend Car of the Year.

The Town Car&#x27;s redesign gave the model a significant sales boost in 1990, helping Lincoln achieve record total sales that year. The second-generation Town Car became one of the best-selling full-size U.S. luxury sedans. Town Car sales quickly declined again and would drop below 100,000 in 1995 for the first time in over ten years. This decline mirrored what had been going on in the luxury car market as buyers’ tastes shifted more towards nimbler, performance-oriented models, and eventually SUVs.

Following the discontinuation of the Cadillac Fleetwood by General Motors after 1996, the Lincoln Town Car became the longest-length regular-production sedan sold in the United States.

=== Development ===
The second-generation Town Car was developed from 1985 until 1989 under the codename FN36, at a cost of US$650 million, led by project manager John Jay. Following its downsizing to the Panther platform in 1980, the Lincoln Town Car was originally slated to be discontinued by the middle of the decade and replaced by a smaller front-wheel drive sedan; after the 1979 fuel crisis, gasoline prices were predicted to reach $2.50 per gallon and Ford Motor Company had lost $1.5 billion for 1980. However, by 1984, full-size Lincoln sales had rapidly increased, with 1984 sales up 300% over 1980. Instead of ending the product cycle of the Lincoln Town Car, Ford product planners instead chose its front-wheel drive mid-size platform (of the Ford Taurus) to become the next-generation Lincoln Continental.

In August 1985, Ford designers began sketching and constructing clay models of competing designs under lead designer Gale Halderman and Ford Group Design Vice President Jack Telnack, with a final design chosen in May 1986; two full-scale (1:1) proposals were reviewed by a four-member design committee, chaired by CEO Donald Petersen, Jack Telnack, Ford President Harold Poling, and William Clay Ford, vice-chairman. Various proposals were considered ranging from a conservative update of the existing Town Car to a European-style body in the design language of the 1988 Lincoln Continental (FN-9, designed in 1984).

The final compromise of the committee sought to keep the identity of the Town Car while introducing a contemporary vehicle for the 1990s. In the interest of fuel economy, the Lincoln Town Car was required to become more aerodynamic (reducing wind noise), but key parts of its design were integrated into its design, with its radiator-style grille, chrome trim, and opera windows. In a major design constraint, the design team was not to make any major reductions in size to the Town Car, preserving its large interior and trunk space as key marketing points to buyers.

In 1984, a second factor driving the design of the FN36 project was initiated, as the United States government introduced regulations mandating passive restraints on vehicles produced after September 1, 1989; along with automatic seat belts, out of necessity, automakers began to reconsider the use of airbags as passive restraints. By 1988, dual airbags remained nearly unused in cars sold in the United States, with the exception of the Mercedes S-Class (Mercedes-Benz W126) and the Porsche 944. To comply with the legislation, Lincoln introduced the 1988 Continental with dual airbags, becoming the first Ford Motor Company (and first domestically produced vehicle) with them standard. As adding airbags to the 1988-1989 Town Car would require a redesign of the steering column and entire dashboard, dual airbag were moved to the FN36 project, making them an intended standard feature.

In March 1986, the design freeze for the project occurred, with an intended production start of mid-1989. The second-generation Lincoln Town Car would become the first domestic Ford vehicle engineered outside of the company and constructed by foreign suppliers, with International Automotive Design of Worthing, West Sussex, England handling the engineering, while Japan-based Ogihara Iron Works supplying all of the Town Car body panels from its own factory near the Wixom plant. To improve quality of prototypes, project managers broke from automotive industry precedent, requiring successive hand-built prototypes to be built to production-level quality to determine the locations and causes of specific issues of tooling and manufacturing. From 1988 until 1989, the Town Car would go from over a year behind its production date to two weeks ahead of schedule.

=== Chassis ===
To lower the development and production costs of the extensive redesign, Ford Motor Company retained the Panther platform for the Lincoln Town Car, continuing its use of rear-wheel drive. In a major change, rear air suspension (introduced as an option for all three Panther vehicles in 1988) became standard equipment on all Town Cars. For 1990, the Town Car was produced with 11-inch rear drum brakes (identical to its 1989 predecessor); for 1991, they were replaced by 10-inch solid rotor disc brakes.

Due to development delays in the Modular engine program, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car was released with the same powertrain as its predecessor: the small block V8 engine with a 4-speed AOD overdrive automatic. In October 1990, the 302 (marketed as 5.0 L) V8 was replaced by a 4.6 L SOHC Modular V8 for 1991 models; for the 1994 model year, the optional 210 hp dual-exhaust version of the engine became standard. Shared with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis, the SOHC version of the 4.6 L Modular V8 would see use in a number of other Ford vehicles within the Ford light-truck line, remaining in production into 2014. For 1993, the AOD transmission was converted to electronic operation, becoming the AOD-E. In 1994, along with a mid-cycle refresh, the 1995 Town Car received the higher-torque 4R70W from the Lincoln Mark VIII.

=== Body ===
The second-generation Lincoln Town Car was designed by Gale Halderman and Ford Group Design Vice President Jack Telnack.

==== Exterior ====
In its redesign for the 1990 model year, Lincoln stylists sought a completely new design for the Town Car. Many traditional Lincoln styling cues were heavily reworked or abandoned completely. Although the Town Car would keep its formal notchback sedan roofline, the flat-sided fenders and angular lines seen since the Continentals and Mark IIIs of the late 1960s disappeared. Stylists made the body more aerodynamic reducing the drag coefficient from 0.46 to 0.36 (matching the 1988 Continental and besting the Mark VII). The 1990 Town Car still retained several styling influences, including its vertical taillights, radiator-style grille, hood ornament, alloy wheels, and vertical C-pillar window. In a move to market the Town Car to buyers of contemporary vehicles, several other changes were made. Although two-tone paint remained available (featuring a lower body accent color in gray metallic), monotone paint schemes would become increasingly standard. In a major change, a vinyl roof was no longer offered, since vinyl roofs declined in popularity among many buyers. Spoked aluminum wheels were dropped from the options list for 1990, while locking wire wheel discs remained through 1992.

In late 1992, the exterior was given a minor update with a new grille and slightly redesigned tail lamp lenses (distinguished by a &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern) for 1993 models. As with the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis, the Town Car received a larger update for the 1995 model year in late 1994 as the FN116. This facelift is distinguished by the deletion of the fixed quarter glass in the rear doors along with the redesign of the side mirrors (enlarged and changed to body-color). Although the bumper largely remained unchanged, the front fascia was updated as the headlamp clusters are changed to a clear-lens design and separated from the grille. The grille was redesigned, returning to the 1990-1992 design in a surround fitting closer to the body. The rear fascia saw the trim between the tail lamps redesigned, featuring additional running lights, while the reverse lamps were moved from the outer edges of the reflector panel to the center, beneath the lid lock cover (similar to the 1985 - 1987 models).

==== Interior ====
In a departure from the Lincoln Continental and Mark VII, the use of the Panther platform necessitated a degree of component sharing with the Ford and Mercury counterparts. Although fitted with its own seats and door panels, the Town Car was fitted with essentially the same dashboard as the Mercury Grand Marquis (versions with digital instruments retained the instrument panel layout from 1988 until 1989). In 1993, the wood trim was changed to an orange-toned walnut. Due to its popularity (and to better separate the Town Car from its Ford/Mercury counterparts), the digital instrument panel was made standard; as such, the climate-control system was converted to a digital display. New for the 1995 model year was an integrated, voice-activated in-car cellular telephone concealed in the center armrest, which featured a speakerphone as well as a rearview mirror-mounted microphone for hands-free calling.

As part of its 1995 Mid-cycle refresh, the interior saw a greater degree of change than the exterior. To bring the design up to date (and in line with the rest of the Lincoln line), the dashboard and door panels featured a curved design, while influenced by the Mark VIII, the 6-passenger design of the Town Car precluded the adoption of a center console in the interior. To increase storage space, the dual center armrests of the front seats on Signature and Cartier models were redesigned to include storage compartments (to hold cassettes and the optional cellular telephone). The dashboard design continued into the new door panels, now with an illuminated power window and seat adjuster cluster, and a back-lit power door lock switch placed higher on the door. Releases for the trunk and fuel door were moved from the dashboard onto the lower driver&#x27;s door. Redesigned seat patterns now offered an available driver and front passenger electric heat feature. The radio antenna was integrated into the rear window. Although the basic controls of the interior remained common across all Panther vehicles, the Town Car gained a model-specific instrument panel, featuring italicized readouts.

For 1996, the climate controls were again redesigned; while Cartier Designer Editions featured genuine wood trim on the dashboard and door panels. In 1997, a few changes were made, the rear center armrest added a pair of cup holders, while Cartier models gained rear-seat vanity mirrors mounted in the headliner. Also in 1997, the trim level badges were moved to the front fenders in place of the &quot;Town Car&quot; badges. Subsequently, the rear side opera windows no longer featured their trim-level engravings.

=== Trim ===
Upon its redesign in October 1989, the Lincoln Town Car carried over its three previous trim levels: base, Signature Series, and Cartier Designer Edition. For 1991, the base trim was renamed Executive Series. From 1989 through 1996, the Lincoln Town Car was available with a factory towing package.

The Base (Executive Series from 1991MY onward) Town Car offered six-passenger seating with two bench seats, a four-speaker AM/FM stereo with cassette player, 6-way front power seats, a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission, cloth seating surfaces, fifteen-inch tires, dashboard clock, and Ford&#x27;s proprietary keypad entry system, marketed as &#x27;[&#x27;SecuriCode&quot;.

The Signature Series added a digital vacuum fluorescent instrument cluster, trip computer, and standard alloy wheels. The Cartier Edition was fitted with the same features as the Signature Series, adding a JBL-branded sound system with an amplifier, a security system, alloy spoked wheels, and other details, such as cloth and leather seats. In a departure from tradition, starting in 1990, Cartier Designer Edition Town Cars were no longer available in a single color combination yearly, but in several different interior/exterior combinations. In addition, aside from gray lower body trim offered as an option for Signature Series Town Cars, Cartier Editions became the only two-tone versions of the Town Car.

==== Special editions ====

In addition to the three standard trims of the Lincoln Town Car, various special edition option packages were produced by Lincoln (excluding dealer-produced versions).

Jack Nicklaus Signature Series (1992–1997)The Jack Nicklaus Signature Series was a special-edition option package for the Town Car Signature Series featured a green exterior with a white top; the interior consisted of white leather with green accents. Another version of the package was sold with a white exterior and a standard roof; the interior trim was similar, with white leather seats and green carpets and trim.

Most Jack Nicklaus editions have ornaments and wording on the exterior trimmed in gold including green and gold &quot;Golden Bear&quot; badges on the front fenders. Options included on 1992 through 1997 Jack Nicklaus Signature Series included memory seats with power lumbar/recliner, leather seats, and monotone paint.

Regatta Edition (1994)The Regatta Edition was a maritime-themed special-edition option package for the Signature Series, with approximately 1,500 produced. The package consisted of White Oxford leather seats (with optional blue seat piping), with regatta blue carpeting; the doors and instrument panel featured matching blue-color trim.

The package was often paired with a white oxford vinyl carriage roof featuring embroidery on the C-pillar near the opera windows.

Spinnaker Edition (1995)Replacing the Regatta Edition, the Spinnaker Edition option package featured tri-coat paint, two-toned leather seats, the Spinnaker logo on the floor mats, and 16&quot; spoked aluminum wheels.
Diamond Anniversary Edition (1996)To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Lincoln in 1996, the division sold a Diamond Anniversary Edition of the Town Car Signature Series (alongside the Continental and Mark VIII). Featuring a unique accent stripe, leather seats, wood instrument panel trim, window badging, cellular telephone, power moonroof, JBL audio system, auto electro-chromatic dimming mirror with compass, and traction assist, the Diamond Anniversary Edition included nearly every available option on the Lincoln Town Car.

Cypress Edition (1996)The Cypress Edition of the Signature Series featured Cypress Gold Frost exterior paint, a two-toned leather interior, and red Cypress tree badging.

=== Features ===
At its 1990 redesign, the Lincoln Town Car was offered with relatively few options, with nearly all features as standard equipment. On the Signature Series, the only options were leather seat trim, a moonroof, a 10-disc CD changer, a JBL sound system, a security system, and an onboard telephone.

The redesign highlighted several new features that had never been available before on the Town Car. A two-position driver&#x27;s memory seat was standard on Cartier Editions (optional on Signature Series); the memory seats featured an 8-way adjustment for both seats and inflatable lumbar support. While technically a carryover feature from 1989, the Electrochromic Dimming Mirror was redesigned for the much wider rear window of the new Town Car.

A number of advances were made in the safety features available for the Lincoln Town Car, with ABS becoming an optional feature in 1990. Following the return of 4-wheel disc brakes to the Town Car in 1991 (for the first time since 1979), ABS became standard in 1992. Initially, the 1990 Town Car came with dual airbags as standard equipment. However, due to a March 14, 1990 fire at the facility where the passenger airbag&#x27;s propellant was produced, the passenger airbag essentially became a delete option, with a credit on the window sticker issued for the price of the missing airbag. Upon the owner&#x27;s request, for the price of the issued credit, the passenger airbag would be installed once supply became available. By the beginning of the 1992 model year, all Town Cars come equipped with dual airbags from the factory.

== Third generation (FN145; 1998–2011) ==
The third generation of the Lincoln Town Car was unveiled at the 1997 New York International Auto Show, going on sale in November 1997. For the 1998 model year, all three Panther-platform sedans underwent complete exterior and interior redesigns, with the Town Car given the most extensive revision. Notably, the third-generation Town Car was introduced nearly concurrently with the Lincoln Navigator, the first SUV sold by the Lincoln division.

Due to organizational restructuring, the third generation Town Car marked several changes within Lincoln-Mercury. From 1999 to 2002, the Lincoln-Mercury division became a brand of Premier Automotive Group, a division of Ford created to manage its premium automotive brands acquired during the 1990s; following organizational difficulties (leading to Lincoln once again falling behind Cadillac in sales by 2000), Lincoln-Mercury was restored under its previous divisional structure during 2002. As part of The Way Forward, the 2007 closure of Wixom Assembly Plant was announced, initially putting the future of the Town Car at risk. To continue the Town Car, for the 2008 model year, production was transferred to the St. Thomas Assembly plant in Canada, alongside the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.

===Chassis &amp; Powertrain===
Under the hood, the 4.6L V8 received a power increase to 205 hp on single exhaust versions and 220 hp on dual exhaust versions. In a functional change, the coil packs were replaced by a coil-on-plug ignition system. Also, fail-safe cooling was introduced; it included a two-speed electronic radiator fan. Additionally, the 4R70W transmission was carried over and mandated the use of Ford&#x27;s Mercon V fluid. Visually, several components were re-located; the coolant reservoir was moved from the passenger fender well and onto the radiator fan shroud, while the power steering reservoir was moved from the driver-side fender well to the front of the engine. Notably, the Town Car received an engine knock sensor; its Ford and Mercury counterparts did not receive one until 2003.

In another change, the frame was updated to a full-perimeter unit. To improve handling, all Town Cars received a Watt&#x27;s Linkage fitted to the rear suspension. For better stopping power, dual-piston front calipers and larger brake rotors were introduced, which necessitated the use of larger 16-inch wheel designs.

For the 2001 model year, the 4.6L V8 received &quot;Performance Improved&quot; (PI) cylinder heads, which increased horsepower to 220 hp on single exhaust versions and 235 hp on dual exhaust versions.

=== Body ===

==== Exterior ====
While three inches shorter than its 1997 predecessor, the 1998 Town Car gained two inches in width and an inch in height (becoming the tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years). In a major break from Lincoln styling tradition, the Town Car abandoned many of the straight-edged lines of its predecessor. Adopting styling cues of the outgoing Mark VIII and the 1995 Continental, the Town Car adopted a curved design scheme in place of the previous straight-lined body. While the radiator grille was retained, its rectangular shape was changed to oval (its waterfall pattern was adopted by the Lincoln Navigator introduced alongside it), and the hood ornament was deleted. In a reversal from 1997, the Town Car badging was returned to the front fenders; trim badging was moved to the C-pillar.

The curved design scheme carried further to the rear of the Town Car, in the C-pillar (losing its opera windows) into the trunk lid. To differentiate from its Mercury counterpart, the Town Car switched to individual tail-lamps, deleting the filler panel on the trunk lid; a large chrome surround was used on the trunk lid to mount the license plate.

With the introduction of the Town Car L in 2001, the wheelbase was stretched by six inches. To produce the variant at a lower cost, the B-pillar was widened on 2001-02 versions to use the existing rear door glass assembly of the standard Town Car.

==== Interior ====
As with its predecessors, the 1998 Lincoln Town Car visibly shares few common interior parts with its Ford and Mercury counterparts (aside from its steering column and radio). To improve ergonomics, power seat controls on Signature and Cartier models are relocated from the seat to door panel (Executive Series, in 1999). Seat-mounted side airbags become standard on all Town Cars for 1999. In the same year, the Executive Series regained its rear-seat center armrest (initially deleted in a cost-cutting move). A new in-vehicle telematics system, called &quot;RESCU&quot;, included a rearview mirror with integrated microphone and SOS and roadside assistance buttons, and replaced the previous in-car telephone with a portable Motorola Timeport cellular telephone that now featured voice recognition. The system was discontinued after the 2003 model year.

===2003 Update and Re-engineering===
Ford re-engineered the Panther platform for 2003, with the Lincoln Town Car once again receiving the most extensive revisions of all Panther platform vehicles. Despite these updates, the Town Car remained as a third-generation model until the end of production in 2011.

Extensive chassis updates were made, which included a new frame; it now utilized hydro-formed frame rails, an aluminum #2 cross-member, and was also fully boxed. According to Lincoln, the new frame improved safety as well as chassis rigidity; its resistance to vertical bending was increased by 20% and overall rigidity by 24%. The long running recirculating ball steering setup was replaced by a speed-sensitive rack and pinion setup; it was lighter than the outgoing unit, featured electronic variable assist, and increased steering precision while also reducing service complexity. For more precise handling, aluminum front lower control arms, new front upper control arms, updated steering knuckles, and coil-over front shocks were all adopted. Inverted mono-tube rear shocks were also introduced; they were also mounted to the outside of the frame rails. Moreover, improved brakes were introduced that featured a quiet EBD brake booster and mechanical panic assist; they optimized front-rear brake bias. To add, these revisions required that the Town Car use larger, 17-inch wheels with a high positive offset (flat-face design).

Mechanically, the Town Car also received several updates. A slightly revised 4.6L V8 was now paired to dual exhaust on all Town Cars; the exhaust system was also completely redesigned, with exhaust hangers now mounted to the frame rails for a reduction in NVH. These changes resulted in the Town Car producing 239 hp and 287 lb-ft of torque; this would be the final power increase for the Town Car. For better off-the-line acceleration, all Town Cars received a 3.27:1 rear axle ratio (shared with the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor). To increase oil life, the engine oil pan&#x27;s capacity was enlarged to 6 quarts. Furthermore, a variable-speed electronic radiator fan replaced the outgoing two-speed unit. For improved carbon emissions, the EGR system was updated, and the fuel system was now return-less. Visually, the updated engine could be distinguished from its 2002 predecessor by a new engine cover, which featured a silver &quot;V8&quot; emblem, fan-shroud mounted power steering reservoir (formerly bolted to the engine), passenger-side oil fill cap (was on the driver side), passenger-side engine fuse box (was on the driver inner fender), and an accessory belt guard.

Until the end of production, minor mechanical revisions would continue to be made. For 2005, the Town Car adopted electronic throttle control; the move necessitated that the cruise function be moved to the engine computer and also required further electronic controls for the transmission (now renamed as the 4R70E). Furthermore, the 28-spline axle was replaced by an improved 31-spline unit. In a minor change, the Town Car received a heated PCV valve.

For 2006, the transmission received internal revisions once again and was renamed as the 4R75E.

All Town Cars received Flex Fuel capability for 2009, enabling them to run on E85, gasoline, or any mixture of both.

====Exterior (2003–2011)====
As part of the 2003 update, the entire body of the Town Car was restyled in an evolutionary fashion. To bring it in line with contemporary Lincoln vehicles, the lower body was squared off and the oval grille was redesigned in the style of the Lincoln LS; the hood ornament made its return after a 5-year absence. Additionally, the extended wheelbase Town Car L received model-specific widened rear door glass. Also, the long-running Town Car badges were deleted from the front fenders. Moreover, while styled similarly to its 2002 predecessor, the rear fascia was updated, and the Town Car badge returned to the trunk lid for the first time since 1997.

====Interior (2003–2011)====
Several revisions were also made to the interior for 2003. While the dashboard was carried over from 2002, the center stack was streamlined; it featured a new radio, dual zone electronic climate controls, and an analog clock (the latter was previously exclusive to the Cartier). In addition, the slide-out dash mounted cup-holders were replaced by storage cubbies; they were moved into the front center seat bottom. Also, the front center armrest was updated and now featured a bi-directional storage lid. In a minor change, the instrument cluster was updated with new gauge faces. Moreover, new seats were introduced with improved leather upholstery and larger front headrests for improved safety. Furthermore, the door panels were redesigned with improved fit and finish. Alongside the Lincoln LS, the 2003 Town Car introduced an optional DVD-based satellite navigation system designed by Pioneer; it was later paired with THX sound processing. With the exception of the Executive, ultra-sonic parking assist was now standard alongside a power-open/close trunk lid.

Lincoln would continue to make minor interior revisions to the Town Car. Midway through the 2003 model year, the front seat bottom pouches were deleted to reduce production costs. In 2005, the Town Car received a re-designed steering wheel and column as well as a front passenger weight sensor; it allowed for the restraint system to automatically enable or disable the front passenger airbag as needed. For 2006, the gauge cluster was revised and now featured a tachometer. As production was moved to St. Thomas, for 2008, the optional DVD-based satellite navigation system was discontinued and all Town Cars now featured either a single-CD/cassette AM/FM four-speaker stereo or an optional Audiophile Sound System with AM/FM stereo, eight speakers, and a 6-disc in-dash CD changer. In another change, the optional power sunroof was permanently deleted for 2008. Due to a new federal safety regulation, recessed window switches were introduced for 2009. In 2011, updated head restraints were introduced in compliance with new federal safety standards. Lastly, as production neared the end, some 2011 models featured a front center armrest that lacked the bi-directional storage compartment.

===Trim===
The third generation Lincoln Town Car was initially produced in four trim levels: Executive Series, Signature Series, Signature Series Touring Sedan, and Cartier; trims would be re-structured several times until the end of production in 2011.

The base Executive Series offered standard rear air suspension, Lincoln&#x27;s SecuriLock anti-theft system, Lincoln&#x27;s SmartLock anti-lockout system, automatic headlamps, heated mirrors, all-speed traction control, an electronic message center with Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Tripminder&quot;, anti-lock brakes, leather seats with an 8 way power driver seat/6 way power passenger seat (cloth was optional for 1998, front passenger seat became 8-way power in 1999), leather wrapped steering wheel with cruise control functions, a &quot;Premium Sound&quot; AM/FM/Cassette stereo with four speakers, electronic automatic temperature control (EATC), seat-mounted side airbags (1999 and newer), and 16&quot; &quot;Gear Tooth&quot; aluminum wheels.

The mid-level Signature Series added a JBL (1998 only, Alpine for 1999–2003) AM/FM/Cassette stereo, a two-driver memory function for the driver seat and mirrors, an electronic auto-dimming rear view mirror, a front passenger lumbar function, a steering wheel with redundant audio/temperature controls, and 16&quot; &quot;Snowflake&quot; aluminum wheels. Available options included heated front seats, a 9-speaker 145-watt audio system with digital signal processing, an auto-dimming driver mirror, a power moon roof, a six-disc CD changer, a wood-trim steering wheel, an integrated cellular phone, two-tone paint, and a Premium Package which consolidated several of the above options into one option package.

From 1998 to 2002, the Signature Series Touring Sedan was slotted above the Signature Series. In an attempt to draw in younger buyers who sought sportier features, it was Lincoln&#x27;s counterpart to the Handling and Performance Package offered on the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis. Touring Sedan models featured a 3.55:1 rear axle ratio for improved acceleration, a higher-stall 11.25-inch torque converter, dual exhaust, re-tuned suspension components with larger stabilizer bars &amp; sport tuned steering, unique perforated leather seats, black birds-eye maple interior trim, an argent grille, monochromatic body-side moldings, and wider 16&quot; &quot;Chrome-Tech&quot; wheels on touring tires. All available options, except two-tone paint, were shared with the Signature Series.

The top-trim Cartier added Cartier-specific leather seat trim; the seats had Cartier logos stitched into the seat-backs and unique upholstery. Cartier insignias were also found on the interior door straps (1998–2002) and floor mats. In addition, an analog &quot;Cartier Clock&quot; was placed in the center of the dash above the climate controls. Moreover, heated front seats were standard. Cartier specific features also carried over to the exterior with a black &quot;Lincoln Star&quot; front fascia badge and a black Cartier badge on the trunk-lid. Furthermore, the Cartier received 16-inch &quot;Cartier&quot; chrome wheels. Like the Signature Touring Sedan, dual exhaust was standard. The Cartier shared several of its free-standing options with the Signature Series, and even offered the same Premium Package as an option. Lastly, a Gold Package was offered as optional equipment; it featured gold-color exterior badging.

For 2001, the trim levels were expanded as a six-inch extended wheelbase Town Car was introduced and marketed towards livery and limousine services. To accommodate the extended wheelbase, the B-pillars were widened; this was also done to facilitate the use of the same rear door glass from the standard-wheelbase version. It was offered as both an Executive and Cartier version (named Executive L and Cartier L). According to Lincoln, the extended wheelbase offered an additional 7.8 cubic feet of passenger volume. Additionally, the Cartier L was equipped with rear illuminated vanity mirrors, heated rear seats, 4-way adjustable rear head restraints, and a center armrest that featured redundant controls for the radio, climate controls, and front passenger seat track to allow for more legroom.

For 2002, the Premium Package (included a moon-roof and six-disc CD changer) became a standalone trim level and was slotted above each respective trim that it was based on (Premium Signature Series, Premium Signature Touring Sedan, and Premium Cartier); it was not offered for the Executive Series or as an extended wheelbase version.

For its 2003 update, the Signature Series Touring Sedan was dropped from the lineup. The &quot;Series&quot; suffix was also dropped from the Executive and Signature (on sales brochures, in 2004). In addition, the long-wheelbase Executive L was restricted to fleet sales.

In 2004, several changes were made to the trim lineup. All Premium trims were dropped, and the standard wheelbase Executive was restricted to fleet sales. Furthermore, all iterations of the Cartier were discontinued; they were replaced by the new range-topping Ultimate/Ultimate L. The Ultimate trim was short-lived, as it was discontinued for 2005.

Trim levels were once again re-structured for 2005 as the Town Car was now offered in three trim levels for retail sale: Signature, Signature L, and Signature Limited.
As a replacement for the Ultimate L, the Signature L featured the same &quot;Rear Seats Amenities Package&quot;; it included heated rear seats, 4-way rear passenger headrests, dual rear cup holders with a tissue bin, rear seat illuminated visors, and a center armrest that featured redundant controls for the radio, climate controls, and front passenger seat track to allow for more legroom. In contrast to its fleet-sales only Executive L counterpart, the Signature L offered heated front and rear seats, a wood-trim steering wheel, as well as a DVD-based satellite navigation system (until 2008).

The new top-trim Signature Limited included a Soundmark Audiophile dual-media AM/FM/CD/Cassette radio with digital signal processing, 8 speakers, a subwoofer, and a 150 watt amp; heated front seats; power adjustable pedals with memory; an easy entry/exit driver seat; a full power trunk lid; power moon roof; as well as a wood trim steering wheel. Available options for the Signature Limited included HID headlamps, a THX certified audio system with satellite navigation, a power moon roof, a trunk organizer, 17&quot; fluted aluminum wheels, and two tone paint; all optional equipment (except the moon roof) was shared with the Signature L.

In 2006, a Designer series trim was introduced and slotted above the Signature Limited as the new flagship Town Car. Designer models included a Provence leather interior with two-tone door panels, adjustable rear-seat headrests, brushed aluminum scuff plates, additional chrome exterior trim, and 17&quot; 18-spoke chrome-aluminum wheels.

Coinciding with the shift in assembly plants, for 2008, the base Signature and top-trim Designer were permanently discontinued, leaving the Signature Limited and extended wheelbase Signature L as the sole remaining models for retail sale until the end of production in 2011; the fleet-only Executive and Executive L would also continue until 2011. Furthermore, many available options were standardized or deleted outright, leaving HID headlamps, daytime running lamps, white-wall tires, 17&quot; 18 spoke chrome-aluminum wheels and a trunk organizer as the only remaining options.

=== Special editions ===

Limited EditionFrom 2003 to 2004, Lincoln offered a Limited Edition package for the Ultimate trim; it had Limited badges on the C-pillar, fog lights, heated and memory seats, as well as Arden inserts in the rims and grille. For 2005, the Limited Package was now offered on the Signature Limited with two-tone paint schemes (in addition to two-tone seats); the fog lights were also deleted from the package.

Pro SeriesOffered in 2004, a special Pro-series badge was placed on the C-pillars; having the background of a golf course. This badge was stitched onto the front seats, in addition to having chrome 9-spoke rims and a two-tone color scheme.

25th Anniversary EditionLincoln commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Town Car by offering a 25th Anniversary Edition package on the 2006 Signature Limited. The package included chrome B-pillar and door handles, unique Eucalyptus wood applique and matching steering wheel with wood inserts, scuff plates with &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; and &quot;25th-anniversary&quot; badging, Provence leather individual 40/20/40 lounge seating with individual comfort, shirring, contrast piping and rear seat adjustable headrests, fog lamps, and 9-spoke chrome wheels.

Continental EditionOffered in 2010–11 was the Continental Edition package; available as an option only on the Signature Limited trim. The package added Continental badging, chrome 17-inch wheels, and accents to the B-pillars. On the interior, the Continental name was embroidered on the front seats and front floor mats.

== Variants ==

===Trim level timeline===
=== Livery variants ===
Featuring a standard V8 engine, body-on-frame design, rear-wheel drive and large exterior and interior dimensions, the Town Car became popular in livery and commercial service. In commercial service, the typical Lincoln Town Car saw a life expectancy of well over 400,000 miles. Its basis on the Ford Panther chassis gave it powertrain and suspension commonality with the Mercury Grand Marquis and the Ford LTD Crown Victoria (later the Crown Victoria). This design made them durable even in the rough conditions taxi and livery cars are subjected to, and easy and cheap to repair when they did suffer damage.

The Lincoln Town Car was popular as a stretch limousine donor chassis; it was the most commonly used limousine and chauffeured car in the United States and Canada. Hearses and funeral cars were also built on the Town Car chassis, through Ford&#x27;s QVM program; the chassis was modified by coachbuilders for use in the funeral business, though Cadillac has always dominated in this market.

=== Presidential State Car ===
A 1989 Lincoln Town Car was commissioned by United States President George H. W. Bush as the Presidential State Car of the United States to succeed the 1983 Cadillac Fleetwood used during the Ronald Reagan administration. The Presidential Town Car limousine arrived in 1989 and was the state car for the entire presidency of George H. W. Bush. It was succeeded by a 1993 Cadillac Fleetwood, used by his successor, Bill Clinton. As of 2021, the 1989 Lincoln Town Car is currently the last Lincoln vehicle to have served as a Presidential State Car.

=== Town Car L ===
A new &quot;L&quot; designation was used for factory extended-wheelbase Town Cars from 2000 to 2011. The L editions offered an additional of rear-seat legroom, as well as remote access audio and climate controls mounted in the rear center armrest. Also included was a two-way travel switch for the front passenger seat base (a feature shared with the extended-wheelbase Jaguar XJ). The L designation was applied to the top-of-line Cartier (2000–2003), Ultimate (2004 only), and Signature (2005–2011) trim levels. Fleet buyers received it under the Executive L trim designation. Mechanically, Town Car L variants feature several heavy duty components shared with both the fleet-only extended wheelbase Crown Victoria as well as the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor including a heavy-duty front stabilizer bar, heavy duty front struts (2003-2011), a larger battery, as well as a heavy duty cooling system which features an auxiliary transmission and power steering cooler.

For 2000–02 versions, the &quot;L&quot; edition is identified by a widened B-pillar, bearing the Lincoln &quot;star&quot; ornament; maintaining parts commonality with the standard Town Car. The 2003-2011 &quot;L&quot; editions had longer rear doors, featuring wider versions of the fixed windows.

=== Ballistic Protection Series ===
Starting in 2003, the Lincoln Town Car had been available featuring ballistic protection from the factory. Adding nearly $100,000 to the base price, the armored body and bulletproof glass increased the curb weight of the Town Car to nearly . Other changes included the suspension and brakes. A few dealers in the US were authorized to sell this series.

===Hongqi CA7460===
In China, FAW produced a licensed version of the Lincoln Town Car rebadged as the &quot;Hongqi CA7460(红旗,Red flag CA7460)&quot; and &quot;Hongqi Qijian(红旗旗舰,Flagship)&quot; from November 10, 1998 until 2005. The limousine version is currently called the Hongqi Limousine L1, L2 and L3 respectively. Pricing in 1998 was at 690,000 RMB (US$109,710) while limousines were added to the range. The L3 was introduced in 2001 and had a wheelbase of . For 2002, the L1 was introduced and had a wheelbase of and the L2 was introduced in 2003 and had the longest wheelbase out of the three with . Pricing for the limousine variant was 1,350,000 RMB (US$214,650).

== Sales ==
== Discontinuation ==
During the 2000s, in spite of declining sales, the Town Car remained one of the highest-selling American-brand luxury sedans. Outside of retail markets, it was the most used limousine and chauffeured car in the United States and Canada.

In 2006, as part of The Way Forward, Ford considered ending production of Lincoln&#x27;s largest model as part of the 2007 closing of the Wixom Assembly Plant. Industry observer George Peterson said &quot;It blows everybody’s mind that they are dropping the Town Car. Just think what Ford could do if they actually invested in a re-skin of Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis, and Town Car.&quot; Ultimately, Wixom Assembly was closed following the 2007 model year, with the production of the Town Car consolidated with the Ford Crown Victoria, Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, and Mercury Grand Marquis in Canada at St. Thomas Assembly; the first Canadian-produced Town Car was assembled on January 10, 2008.

Following the 2007 model year, however, the Town Car was discontinued for retail sale in Canada, available exclusively for fleet and livery customers afterward. In 2009, the fate of all three Panther-platform models was determined when Ford announced the 2011 closure of the St. Thomas Assembly Plant. For the limousine and livery markets, Ford had promised availability of the Town Car through the 2011 model year; retail sales continued on a limited basis in the United States and for export. In 2010, Ford announced the closure of the Mercury brand at the end of the year, effectively making the Town Car the final model line sold for retail sale produced by St. Thomas Assembly (retail sales of the Crown Victoria ended after 2007).

On August 29, 2011, the final Town Car rolled off the assembly line, without any fanfare or announcement from Ford; St. Thomas Assembly produced its final vehicle (a 2012 Crown Victoria for export) on September 15, 2011.

While Lincoln has not developed a direct successor to the model line following its 2011 discontinuation, the use of the nameplate returned for 2012, denoting a variant of the Lincoln MKT designed for limousine/livery use. The MKT was discontinued after the 2019 model year without a direct replacement, marking the final use of the Town Car name; the nameplate was in use for 49 continuous years by Lincoln (30 as a distinct model line, 11 as a sub-model of the Continental, 8 of the MKT).

== Awards ==

The Town Car has received several awards and recognitions.

* &quot;Forbes magazine&quot; repeatedly named the Town Car one of the best cars to be chauffeured in along with other, often more expensive flagship sedans, such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series and Lexus LS. The Town Car Signature L features a rear seat comfort package which not only provides rear seat passengers with audio system and rear compartment climate controls, but also features a control function which allows for the rear seat occupants to move the passenger seat forward, a feature exclusive to few ultra-luxury sedans. In addition to its many amenities, the Signature L also features an unrivaled of rear legroom, and of rear shoulder room.
* In 1990, upon the introduction of the second generation Town Car, the vehicle was named Motor Trend Car of the Year. However this award was later included by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in a list of the poorly chosen car of the year award winners. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; has changed the criteria by which it awards its highest accolade: Originally, Car of the Year awards went to the vehicle model which was the most significantly improved over the previous year&#x27;s design in all respects. Currently, no such consideration is given to contenders for this award, and vehicles are considered for the award even if in their first year of production.

<text>Lawrence Samuel Storch (January 8, 1923 – July 8, 2022) was an American actor and comedian known for his comic television roles, including voice-over work for cartoon shows such as Mr. Whoopee on &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot; and his live-action role of the bumbling Corporal Randolph Agarn on &quot;F Troop&quot; that won a nomination for Emmy Award in 1967.

==Early life==
Lawrence Samuel Storch was born in New York City on January 8, 1923, the son of Alfred Storch, a cabdriver and broker, and his wife, Sally Kupperman Storch, a telephone operator, jewelry-store owner and rooming-house operator. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that he was born in the Bronx, whereas &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he was born in Manhattan and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that he was born on the Upper West Side. His parents were observant Jews. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx with Don Adams, who remained his lifelong friend. Storch said that, because of hard times in the Great Depression, he never graduated from high school, instead finding work as a comic for $12 a week, opening for bandleader Al Donahue at the band shell in Sheepshead Bay.

During World War II, he served in the United States Navy, where he was shipmates with Tony Curtis on the submarine tender .

==Career==
===Performing===
Storch was originally a comic. It led to guest appearances on dozens of television series: &quot;Mannix&quot;; &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;; &quot;Hennesey&quot;; &quot;Get Smart&quot;; &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;; &quot;Columbo&quot;; &quot;CHiPs&quot;; &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;; &quot;McCloud&quot;; &quot;Emergency!&quot;; &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;; &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;; &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;; &quot;That Girl&quot;; &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;; &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;; &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;; &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;; &quot;The Persuaders&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;All in the Family&quot;; &quot;&quot; and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.
His most famous role was from 1965 to 1967 as the scheming Corporal Randolph Agarn on the situation comedy &quot;F Troop&quot;, with Forrest Tucker, Ken Berry and Melody Patterson, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1967. Other memorable performances from the 1960s were Texas Jack in the barroom brawl scene of &quot;The Great Race&quot; and the eponymous character in the Groovy Guru episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

In 1975, Storch co-starred with Bob Burns (who wore a gorilla costume) and Forrest Tucker on the short-lived but popular Saturday morning children&#x27;s show &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, S1 E15 &amp; S2 E9 (1978); was Al Bundy&#x27;s childhood hero on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (Al Bundy&#x27;s daughter Kelly attended an acting school operated by Larry); and was a semi-regular on &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;. He co-starred on the short-lived series &quot;The Queen and I&quot;.

===Variety show appearances===
Storch appeared on many variety shows, including &quot;Sonny and Cher&quot;, &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, with several appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. Jackie Gleason asked Storch to fill in for him in the summer of 1953 while Gleason was on hiatus. It led to the 10-episode &quot;The Larry Storch Show&quot; with guest stars including Janet Blair, Risë Stevens, Dick Haymes, and Cab Calloway.

===As an impressionist and voiceover actor===
An impressionist, Storch recreated hundreds of voices and dialects ranging from Muhammad Ali to Claude Rains and voiced characters in many television and film animations, including &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;, &quot;The Inspector&quot;, &quot;The Brady Kids&quot;, &quot;Cool Cat&quot;, &quot;Koko the Clown&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, and &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo&quot;.

Storch worked with Mel Blanc and June Foray at Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, voicing characters such as Merlin the Magic Mouse and Cool Cat. He continued his association with Filmation as a voiceover actor in other series and films the company produced, including &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; (1972) where he voiced Amos, farmhand to Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.

===Film appearances===
Storch appeared in more than 25 Hollywood films, including &quot;Gun Fever&quot; (1958), &quot;Who Was That Lady?&quot; (1960), &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; (1962), &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; (1963), &quot;Wild and Wonderful&quot; (1964), &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965). He also appeared in &quot;Bus Riley&#x27;s Back in Town&quot; (1965), &quot;A Very Special Favor&quot; (1965), &quot;That Funny Feeling&quot;, (1965), &quot;The Great Bank Robbery&quot; (1969), &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington&quot; (1977), &quot;Record City&quot; (1978), &quot;S.O.B&quot; (1981), &quot;Fake-Out&quot; (1982), &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; (1983), and &quot;A Fine Mess&quot; (1986), as well as the cult sci-fi films &quot;The Monitors&quot; (1969) and &quot;Without Warning&quot; (1980). Tony Curtis and Storch reunited for a 2003 run of the musical version of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. In 2005, he worked with Anthony Michael Hall in &quot;Funny Valentine&quot; and appeared in the documentary feature &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;.

===Stage work===
After success in television and films, Storch returned to the New York stage, having first performed on the Broadway stage in the 1950s. He received rave reviews for the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Breaking Legs&quot;. Co-starring Philip Bosco and Vincent Gardenia, the show extended several times before going on the road. Storch appeared in the Broadway productions of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (which Storch considered his favorite), &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; with Jean Stapleton, Marion Ross, and Jonathan Frid, and &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; with Reba McEntire. He toured the United States and Europe with &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

In 2004, he was in &quot;Sly Fox&quot; with Richard Dreyfuss and his old friend Irwin Corey. Larry, then 81 and &quot;Professor&quot; Corey, 90, did eight shows a week. In March 2008, Storch celebrated his 50th anniversary performing on Broadway. His first Broadway appearance had been &quot;Who Was That Lady I Saw You With&quot;, later made into a 1960 film starring Dean Martin and Tony Curtis, with Storch appearing.

Storch and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; star Marie Wallace appeared in &quot;Love Letters&quot; by A. R. Gurney on June 24, 2012, a benefit performance for the Actor&#x27;s Temple in New York City.

In the summer of 2012, Storch appeared in a benefit performance of &quot;Love Letters&quot; with actress Diana Sowle (best known for her role as Mrs. Bucket in the original Willy Wonka film) in Farmville, Virginia to benefit The Tom Mix Rangers.

===Comedy LPs===
Storch recorded a comedy LP, &quot;Larry Storch at The Bon Soir&quot;, released by Jubilee Records in the 1960s. His other records include &quot;Larry Storch Reads Philip Roth&#x27;s Epstein&quot; and singles such as &quot;Pooped&quot; b/w &quot;The Eighth Wonder Of The World&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot;.

A month before he died, Storch recorded the blues song &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot; with Mike Clark and his trio. The song was posthumously released soon after Storch’s passing.

==Personal life==
Storch married actress Norma Catherine Greve on July 10, 1961. They remained married until her death at age 81 on August 28, 2003. Both briefly appeared in the made-for-television movie &quot;The Woman Hunter&quot; (1972). He had three children: a stepson, Lary May; a daughter, Candace Herman, the result of a brief encounter with his future wife, born in 1947 and placed for adoption (and later reunited); and a stepdaughter, June Cross, born in 1954 to Norma and Jimmy Cross (&quot;Stump&quot; of the song-and-dance team Stump and Stumpy).

Storch&#x27;s younger brother, Jay (1924–1987), was an actor/voiceover performer under the name Jay Lawrence.

Larry Storch died at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on July 8, 2022, at age 99. The Associated Press reported that he died from natural causes. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that he died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Honors and tributes==

<text>Yackandandah is a town in northeast Victoria, Australia. It is near the regional cities of Wodonga and Albury, and is close to the tourist town of Beechworth. At the , Yackandandah had a population of 2,008.

== History ==
The indigenous people of the area prior to white colonisation were the Dhudhuroa people, in whose language the toponym &quot;Yackandandah&quot; is said to have meant “one boulder on top of another at the junction of two creeks”, namely the Yackandandah and Commissioner creeks&#x27; intersection.

The area was first opened to white settlement when Irish-born James Osborne took up land at Osborne&#x27;s Flat in 1837. On the discovery of gold deposits on its territory in 1852, it became a gold mining centre known for its alluvial wet mining techniques. Yackandandah Post Office opened on 13 June 1856. Another office nearby, Yackandandah Junction, opened in 1872 but closed in 1885.

In his local book, Antony O&#x27;Brien (p. 22) quotes an old poem published in the &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot;, 11 June 1857, titled, &quot;The Lass of Yackandandah&quot;.
==Today==
The area is now predominantly a dairy farming and forestry region and has numerous bed and breakfast lodges which allow its many visitors to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the district&#x27;s forest and mountains. It is close to achieving self-sufficiency in energy supply, foreseen to be reached by 2024, based on solar power.

The town is affectionately known as &quot;Yack&quot;.
The commercial centre of the town, known as the Yackandandah Conservation Area, is recorded on the Register of the National Estate.

==Rail==
The Yackandandah railway line once linked Yackandandah to Beechworth and opened in 1891. The route to Woorragee and from there to Yackandandah was steep; trains descending the last gradient into Yackandandah would halt (near the now Yackandandah turnoff, from the Beechworth-Wodonga Road) so the guard could apply hand-brakes to carriages and wagons. The last train on the Yackandandah-Beechworth line was in July 1954. Though the line was torn up, many sections of the original right of way are visible from the roadway between Beechworth and Yackandandah. In May 2017 the Victoria State Government budgeted for an extension of the Murray to Mountains Rail Trail side branch from Beechworth to Yackandandah. The side branch currently extends from Beechworth to Everton Station, where it connects to the main trail.

==Culture==
Used for the filming of the 2003 film &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; (starring Michael Caton and Paul Hogan). Yackandandah is home to the annual Yackandandah Folk Festival attracting local, Australian and international artists since 1998. Like the larger neighbouring town of Beechworth, Yackandandah promotes itself as a tourist destination on the basis of its gold mining history and features a period streetscape as well as an increasing number of antique shops.

Two historic buildings, the 146-year-old museum (formerly the Bank of Victoria) and an adjacent timber store (&quot;Rainbow Crystal&quot;), were destroyed by a fire in the early morning of 21 December 2006. A real estate agency was also severely damaged. The museum was rebuilt, reopening in November 2008.

==Sports and recreation==

Golfers play at the course of the Yackandandah Golf Club on Racecourse Road.

The Yackandandah Cricket Club play in both junior and senior grades in the Cricket Albury Wodonga competition.

===Yackandandah Football / Netball Club===
The town has had an active Australian rules football team since its first club meeting in 1881. 

The club has competed in the Tallangatta &amp; District Football League, since 1957, winning senior football premierships in 1964 and 2000.

<doc id="541150" wikidata="Q242051" url="?curid=541150" title="Irshad Manji">
<text>Irshad Manji (born 1968) is a Ugandan-born Canadian educator. She is the author of &quot;The Trouble with Islam Today&quot; (2004) and &quot;Allah, Liberty and Love&quot; (2011), both of which have been banned in several Muslim countries. She also produced a PBS documentary in the &quot;America at a Crossroads&quot; series, titled &quot;Faith Without Fear&quot;, which was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2008. A former journalist and television presenter, Manji is an advocate of a reformist interpretation of Islam and a critic of literalist interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an.

Her latest book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Label Me&quot; (2019), proposes methods on how to heal political, racial, and cultural divides. The ideas in the book are related to the Moral Courage Project, which Manji founded at New York University in 2008 and expanded to the University of Southern California (USC) in 2016, when she was a senior fellow at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership &amp; Policy. After leaving USC, she founded Moral Courage College with the goal of teaching &quot;young people how to engage honestly about polarizing issues rather than shaming or canceling each other&quot;. Manji lectures on these themes as a senior research fellow with the Oxford Initiative for Global Ethics and Human Rights.

== Early life and education ==
Manji was born in 1968 near Kampala, Uganda. Her mother is of Egyptian descent and her father of Indian heritage.

When Idi Amin ordered the expulsion of Asians and other non-Africans from Uganda in the early 1970s, Manji and her family came to Canada as refugees when she was four years old. They settled in Richmond, British Columbia, near Vancouver. Manji attended secular public schools and, every Saturday, a religious school (madrasa). Manji says that, at 14 years old, she was expelled from the madrasa for asking too many questions.

In 1990, Manji earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours in the history of ideas from the University of British Columbia, and won the Governor General&#x27;s Academic Medal for top humanities graduate. In 2002, Manji became writer-in-residence at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Hart House, from where she began writing &quot;The Trouble with Islam Today&quot;. She was a visiting fellow with the International Security Studies program at Yale University in 2006 and was a senior fellow with the Brussels-based European Foundation for Democracy from 2006 to 2012.

== Career ==
Manji began her career working in politics in the 1990s. She was a legislative aide in the Canadian parliament for New Democratic Party member of parliament Dawn Black, then press secretary in the Ontario government for Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister Marion Boyd, and later speechwriter for federal NDP leader Audrey McLaughlin. At the age of 24, she became the national affairs editorialist for the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; and the youngest member of an editorial board for any Canadian daily. She was also a columnist for Ottawa&#x27;s new LGBT newspaper &quot;Capital Xtra!&quot; She participated in a regular &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; segment on TVOntario&#x27;s &quot;Studio 2&quot; from 1992 to 1994, head-to-head against right-wing writer Michael Coren.

Manji hosted and produced several public affairs programs on television, including &quot;Q-Files&quot; for Pulse24 and its successor &quot;&quot; for the Toronto-based Citytv in the late 1990s. When she left the show, Manji donated the television set&#x27;s &quot;big Q&quot; to the Pride Library at the University of Western Ontario.

She has also appeared on television networks around the world, including Al Jazeera, the CBC, BBC, MSNBC, C-SPAN, CNN, PBS, the Fox News Channel, CBS, and HBO.

She was also a visiting professor at New York University (NYU) from 2008 to 2015. Manji joined NYU&#x27;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service to create the Moral Courage Project, an initiative to teach young people how to speak truth to power within their own communities. Her courses focused on how &quot;to make values-driven decisions for the sake of their integrity – professional and personal&quot;. In April 2013, Moral Courage TV (on YouTube), was launched by Manji and Cornel West, a professor and activist. West spoke of Manji&#x27;s work as a &quot;powerful force for good.&quot; In 2015, Manji developed &quot;the West Coast presence of Moral Courage&quot; at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership &amp; Policy of the University of Southern California.

== Works ==
=== &quot;The Trouble with Islam Today&quot; ===
Manji&#x27;s book &quot;The Trouble with Islam Today&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Trouble with Islam&quot;) was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in 2004. The book was first released in Canada under the previous title in September 2003. It has since been translated into more than 30 languages. Manji offered Arabic, Persian, and Urdu translations of the book available for free-of-charge download on her website. In &quot;The Trouble with Islam Today&quot;, Manji investigates new interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an which she believes are more fitting for the 21st century. The book has been met with both praise and scorn from both Muslim and non-Muslim sources. Several reviewers have called the book &quot;courageous&quot; or &quot;long overdue&quot; while others have said it disproportionately targets Muslims.

Tarek Fatah, a fellow Canadian Muslim who originally criticized &quot;The Trouble With Islam&quot;, reversed his stance, saying that Manji was &quot;right about the systematic racism in the Muslim world&quot; and that &quot;there were many redeeming points in her memoir&quot;.

&quot;The Trouble with Islam Today&quot; is banned in many countries in the Middle East. Since July 2009, the book has also been outlawed in Malaysia.

=== &quot;Faith without Fear&quot; ===
In 2007 Manji released a PBS documentary, &quot;Faith without Fear&quot;. It follows her journey to reconcile faith and freedom, depicting the personal risks she has faced as a Muslim reformer. She explores Islamism in Yemen, Europe and North America, as well as histories of Islamic critical thinking in Spain and elsewhere. &quot;Faith Without Fear&quot; was nominated for an Emmy and was a finalist for the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s Gemini Award. It launched the 2008 Muslim Film Festival, organized by the American Islamic Congress and won Gold at the New York Television Festival.

=== &quot;Allah, Liberty and Love&quot; ===

In 2011, Manji published &quot;Allah, Liberty and Love&quot;. In the book, she examines how Muslims can reinterpret the Qur&#x27;an, speak more freely, and think more independently. To support her approach, Manji cites &quot;ijtihad&quot;, the Islamic tradition of critical thinking in the interpretation of Islamic texts and doctrines. Manji asserts that any change of lasting value to Muslims can only come from within and cannot be imposed from external sources.

Manji agrees to and promotes the validity of interfaith marriages of Muslims to non-Muslims, specially of Muslim women to non-Muslim men, based on ideas of Khaleel Mohammed of San Diego State University (SDSU), in San Diego, California.

As with Manji&#x27;s other writings, &quot;Allah, Liberty and Love&quot; generated both positive and negative responses. Rayyan Al Shawaf, a Beirut-based writer and book critic, laments Manji&#x27;s focus on how the Qur&#x27;an can be reinterpreted by liberal Muslims and not on how legal limits can be set to curb the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s influence. He also argues that Manji promotes ijtihad while overlooking that &quot;&quot;ijtihad&quot; is a sword that cuts both ways.&quot; Al-Shawaf also laments Manji&#x27;s focus &quot;on how liberal Muslims could reinterpret the Koran as opposed to how they might set legal limits on its socio-politico-economic influence.&quot; Melik Kaylan in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot; describes the book as &quot;a rallying cry to Muslims&quot; and full of &quot;snappy phrases that hover between epigrams and slogans—effective soundbites for her supporters.&quot;

Omar Sultan Haque, a researcher and teacher at Harvard University Medical School, argues that although Manji&#x27;s book is important in raising consciousness, it &quot;fails to grapple with some of the more substantial questions that would make [a liberal and open] future [of Islamic Interpretation] a reality.&quot; Haque often describes Manji&#x27;s ideas in a &quot;patronizing manner&quot;. Howard A. Doughty, a professor of political economy at Seneca College, illustrates this with a quote from Haque&#x27;s review: &quot;Manji&#x27;s God resembles an extremely affectionate and powerful high school guidance counselor.&quot;

Doughty, in summarizing his observations of Manji&#x27;s critics says that some scholars (excluding himself) argue that &quot;Manji may lack the &quot;gravitas&quot; to drive home her points and turn her ideas into action.&quot; He instead offers a defense of her approach and argues that &quot;what her critics seem to miss is that her ease of communication, stripped of abstract philosophical, political and economic analysis, is precisely what allows her to turn her thoughts into other people&#x27;s actions.&quot;

The international launch of &quot;Allah, Liberty and Love&quot; was met with controversy. In December 2011, Muslim extremists stormed Manji&#x27;s book launch in Amsterdam; twenty-two Muslim men rushed into the venue and attempted to assault her. During Manji&#x27;s book tour, police cut short her talk in Jakarta due to pressure from one of Indonesia&#x27;s fundamentalist groups, the Islamic Defenders Front. A few days later, hundreds of men from the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council assaulted Manji&#x27;s team and her supporters in Yogyakarta. Several people were injured and at least one had to be treated in a hospital. Shortly afterwards, the government of Malaysia banned &quot;Allah, Liberty and Love&quot;. But in September 2013, a High Court in Kuala Lumpur struck down the ban. The previous year, Nik Raina Nik Abdul Aziz, a Malay woman who was one of the managers of a Borders, was arrested for selling a translation of Manji&#x27;s book before the state had announced its ban. After her three-year legal battle with the authorities, Malaysia&#x27;s Federal Court ruled in her favor and dismissed the government&#x27;s bid to appeal.

=== &quot;Don&#x27;t Label Me&quot; ===
In a pre-release event for her latest book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Label Me: An Incredible Conversation for Divided Times&quot;, Manji was the keynote speaker at the annual Day of Discovery, Dialogue &amp; Action event of the Washington University in St. Louis on 19 February 2019. &quot;Don&#x27;t Label Me&quot; was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press on 26 February. The book is written in the form of an imaginary conversation with Lily, Manji&#x27;s first dog, who is now deceased and plays the role of Devil&#x27;s advocate. According to Dana Gee of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, &quot;It may seem like a gimmicky construct, but it actually works&quot;. Manji uses the conversation to advocate rising above tribalism and engaging in a discourse with those with whom the reader disagrees. In a video published by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in March 2019, Manji says &quot;I&#x27;m here to propose that, while more and more schools are teaching young people how not to be offensive, they also need to be teaching a new generation how not to be offended&quot;. Comedian Chris Rock, a fan of Manji, also promoted the book on Twitter calling it &quot;genius&quot;. In a review of &quot;Don&#x27;t Label Me&quot; for &quot;Areo Magazine&quot;, Samuel Kronen wrote that &quot;Manji provides a wonderful combination of self-deprecation, wit and ferocious honesty and provides insights into some of the greatest social problems we face today.&quot;

== Views ==
Manji has received numerous death threats because of her views. While living in Toronto, she had the windows of her home fitted with bullet-proof glass for security. Manji has been described as a Quranist.

In an interview with &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, describing her political leanings, Manji said, &quot;I&#x27;m not left-wing, I&#x27;m not right-wing. I&#x27;m post-wing&quot;. She has criticized the argument that US wars inspire Islamic extremism. Manji initially supported the United States&#x27; wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s War on Terror. By 2006, her views toward the war in Iraq had become highly critical of the Bush government. On Iraq, she said she &quot;thought the Oval Office had information that was taken into account when it made decisions.&quot; She also said, &quot;I have been openly questioning our work in Afghanistan and the implications of it.&quot;

She argues that Palestinians face two occupations: one imposed by Hamas on women and LGBT people and the other by the Israeli forces in all of Palestine.

== Personal life ==
In 2016, Manji and her partner, Laura Albano, were married in Hawaii. They lived there with their rescue dogs. The couple are now divorced.

<doc id="541158" wikidata="Q941133" url="?curid=541158" title="Java Management Extensions">
<text>Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a Java technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices (such as printers) and service-oriented networks. Those resources are represented by objects called MBeans (for &quot;Managed Bean&quot;). In the API, classes can be dynamically loaded and instantiated.
Managing and monitoring applications can be designed and developed using the Java Dynamic Management Kit.

JSR 003 of the Java Community Process defined JMX 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. JMX 2.0 was being developed under JSR 255, but this JSR was subsequently withdrawn. The JMX Remote API 1.0 for remote management and monitoring is specified by JSR 160. An extension of the JMX Remote API for Web Services was being developed under JSR 262.

Adopted early on by the J2EE community, JMX has been a part of J2SE since version 5.0. &quot;JMX&quot; is a trademark of Oracle Corporation.

== Architecture ==
JMX uses a three-level architecture:
# The &quot;Probe&quot; level – also called the &quot;Instrumentation&quot; level – contains the probes (called MBeans) instrumenting the resources
# The &quot;Agent&quot; level, or MBeanServer – the core of JMX. It acts as an intermediary between the MBean and the applications.
# The &quot;Remote Management&quot; level enables remote applications to access the MBeanServer through connectors and adaptors. A connector provides full remote access to the MBeanServer API using various communication (RMI, IIOP, JMS, WS-* …), while an adaptor adapts the API to another protocol (SNMP, …) or to Web-based GUI (HTML/HTTP, WML/HTTP, …).

Applications can be generic consoles (such as JConsole and MC4J) or domain-specific (monitoring) applications. External applications can interact with the MBeans through the use of JMX connectors and protocol adapters. Connectors serve to connect an agent with a remote JMX-enabled management application. This form of communication involves a connector in the JMX agent and a connector client in the management application.

The Java Platform, Standard Edition ships with one connector, the RMI connector, which uses the Java Remote Method Protocol that is part of the Java remote method invocation API. This is the connector which most management applications use.

Protocol adapters provide a management view of the JMX agent through a given protocol. Management applications that connect to a protocol adapter are usually specific to the given protocol.

== Managed beans ==
A managed bean – sometimes simply referred to as an &quot;MBean&quot; – is a type of JavaBean, created with dependency injection. Managed Beans are particularly used in the Java Management Extensions technology – but with Java EE 6 the specification provides for a more detailed meaning of a managed bean.

The MBean represents a resource running in the Java virtual machine, such as an application or a Java EE technical service (transactional monitor, JDBC driver, etc.). They can be used for collecting statistics on concerns like performance, resources usage, or problems (pull); for getting and setting application configurations or properties (push/pull); and notifying events like faults or state changes (push).

Java EE 6 provides that a managed bean is a bean that is implemented by a Java class, which is called its bean class. A top-level Java class is a managed bean if it is defined to be a managed bean by any other Java EE technology specification (for example, the JavaServer Faces technology specification), or if it meets all of the following conditions:
# It is not a non-static inner class.
# It is a concrete class, or is annotated codice_1.
# It is not annotated with an EJB component-defining annotation or declared as an EJB bean class in codice_2.
No special declaration, such as an annotation, is required to define a managed bean.

A MBean can notify the MBeanServer of its internal changes (for the attributes) by implementing the codice_3. The application interested in the MBean&#x27;s changes registers a listener (codice_4) to the MBeanServer. Note that JMX does not guarantee that the listeners will receive all notifications.

===Types===
There are two basic types of MBean:
* &quot;Standard MBeans&quot; implement a business interface containing setters and getters for the attributes and the operations (i.e., methods).
* &quot;Dynamic MBeans&quot; implement the codice_5 interface that provides a way to list the attributes and operations, and to get and set the attribute values.

Additional types are &quot;Open MBeans&quot;, &quot;Model MBeans&quot; and &quot;Monitor MBeans&quot;. &quot;Open MBeans&quot; are dynamic MBeans that rely on the basic data types. They are self-explanatory and more user-friendly. &quot;Model MBeans&quot; are dynamic MBeans that can be configured during runtime. A generic MBean class is also provided for dynamically configuring the resources during program runtime.

A MXBean (&quot;Platform MBean&quot;) is a special type of MBean that reifies Java virtual machine subsystems such as garbage collection, JIT compilation, memory pools, multi-threading, etc.

A MLet (&quot;Management applet&quot;) is a utility MBean to load, instantiate and register MBeans in a MBeanServer from an XML description. The format of the XML descriptor is:

<text>F Troop is a satirical American television Western sitcom about U.S. soldiers and American Indians in the Wild West during the 1860s. The series originally aired for two seasons on ABC. It debuted in the United States on September 14, 1965, and concluded its run on April 6, 1967, with a total of 65 episodes. The first season of 34 episodes was broadcast in black-and-white and the second season was in color.

The series relied heavily on character-based humor, verbal and visual gags, slapstick, physical comedy, and burlesque comedy. The series played fast and loose with historical events and persons, and often parodied them for comical effect. Some indirect references were made to the culture of the 1960s, such as a &quot;Playbrave Club&quot;, a parody of a Playboy Club and two rock and roll bands, one of which performs songs written in the 1960s.

==Setting and story==

&quot;F Troop&quot; is set at Fort Courage, a fictional United States Army outpost in the Old West, soon after the American Civil War. Fort Courage was named for the fictitious General Sam Courage (portrayed by Cliff Arquette). A town of the same name is adjacent to the fort. The fort is constructed in the stockade style typically found in most American Westerns.

The commanding officer is the gallant although laughably clumsy Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry), who is descended from a long line of distinguished military officers. He is awarded the Medal of Honor after accidentally instigating the final Civil War charge at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Serving as a private in the Quartermaster Corps, he is ordered to fetch the commanding officer&#x27;s laundry (presumably General Grant&#x27;s). As Parmenter rides off to get the laundry, he repeatedly sneezes. A group of Union soldiers mistake his sneezing for an order to attack, turning the tide of the battle and &quot;earning&quot; Parmenter the nickname &quot;The Scourge of Appomattox&quot;. He also is awarded the Purple Heart after he is accidentally pricked in the chest by his father and commanding officer while receiving his first medal, making him &quot;the only soldier in history to get a medal for getting a medal.&quot; He is promoted to captain of remote Fort Courage, a dumping ground for the Army&#x27;s &quot;least useful&quot; soldiers and misfits; the Secretary of War (William Woodson) notes, &quot;Why, the Army sent them out there hoping they&#x27;d all desert.&quot; Indeed, of the three commanding officers at Fort Courage before Captain Parmenter, two &quot;did&quot; desert, while the third suffered a nervous breakdown.

Much of the humor of the series derives from the scheming of Captain Parmenter&#x27;s somewhat crooked but amiable non-commissioned officers, Sergeant Morgan O&#x27;Rourke (Forrest Tucker) and Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch). They, in league with the local (fictitious) American Indian tribe, the Hekawis—led by Chief Wild Eagle (Frank de Kova)—are always seeking to expand and conceal their shady souvenir business, covertly and collectively referred to as &quot;O&#x27;Rourke Enterprises&quot;. Initially, rations and pay were drawn for 30 men at Fort Courage, though only 17 are actually accounted for; the other 13, according to O&#x27;Rourke, are Indian scouts who only come to the fort at night and leave before dawn). The pay for the fictitious scouts is apparently used to help finance O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s operation. Although O&#x27;Rourke and Agarn try to take full advantage of Captain Parmenter&#x27;s innocence and &quot;naïveté&quot; — Parmenter is referred to as &quot;Great White Pigeon&quot; by Wild Eagle — they are also very fond of and fiercely protective of him. Parmenter also struggles to exert his authority outside the ranks. Very bashful, he tries to escape the matrimonial plans of his girlfriend, the amorous shopkeeper–postmistress Jane Angelica Thrift, known locally as &quot;Wrangler Jane&quot; (played by Melody Patterson, who was awarded the role at the age 15, although she had told producers she was 18)—though he becomes a bit more affectionate toward her during the second season.

The episode &quot;Captain Parmenter, One Man Army&quot; reveals that all of the soldiers (troopers) of &quot;F Troop&quot; have been at Fort Courage for at least 20 months, meaning they spent at least part of the Civil War there. They are so incompetent that when they are formed into a firing squad in the episode titled &quot;The Day They Shot Agarn&quot;, all of their shots miss Agarn despite the fact they are standing only a few yards from him. The most common running gag through both seasons of the series (shown in every first season opening except for the pilot episode) involves the fort&#x27;s lookout tower. Every time the cannon is fired in salute, the lit fuse burns out. Corporal Agarn or Private Dobbs then kicks the cannon&#x27;s right wheel, collapsing the cannon and causing it to fire off target. The cannonball strikes a support leg of the lookout tower, bringing it crashing to the ground along with the trooper in it. (In the opening credits, this coincides with the line in the lyrics, &quot;Before they resume with a bang and a boom.&quot;) In one episode, an arrow brings the tower crashing down, and in another, Parmenter yanks down the tower with a lasso. In another episode, loud music causes the tower to collapse. The fort water tower is also prone to this gag. In one variation, Vanderbilt, Parmenter, O&#x27;Rourke, and Agarn are standing in the water tower platform when a lone Indian, &quot;Bald Eagle&quot; (played by Don Rickles), tries to capture Fort Courage by scaling the tower and jumping on the platform; the combined weight causes the floor to collapse and &quot;Bald Eagle&quot; to be captured. In another variation of the cannon gag, the cannon collapses as it is fired, and blows up the fort&#x27;s powder magazine, causing Agarn to be saved from a vengeful Chief Geronimo.

==Characters==
===Main===

====F Troop officers and enlisted men====
* Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry) is the so-called &quot;Scourge of the West.&quot; As military governor of the territory and commander of Fort Courage, he is credited with keeping the peace (which is in fact really kept by O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s secret treaty with the Hekawi tribe –- though other tribes seem to fear his reputation). Chief Wild Eagle knows him by a different title: &quot;The Great White Pigeon&quot;. When the need to keep up appearances arises, the troopers and the Hekawis stage mock battles to fool Parmenter and outsiders. Parmenter is successful at &quot;keeping the peace&quot;; he just does not know why. He is well-meaning and sweet-natured, although essentially clueless and a bit gullible. He also invariably is kind and encouraging to his men, and always bravely leads them into action, albeit ineptly. A stickler for regulation and proper military conduct, he checks the Army Manual for even the oddest situations, such as &quot;If a soldier is captured by horse&quot;. A perpetual klutz, Parmenter is forever jabbing himself, pinching his fingers in or on something, banging into, tripping over, or knocking things over. He cannot dismount a horse properly, and frequently becomes entangled with his ceremonial sword. Parmenter, born in Philadelphia, comes from a &quot;proud family&quot; with a &quot;great military tradition.&quot; Among his ancestors are his first cousin Major Achilles Parmenter, second cousin Lt. Colonel Hercules Parmenter, uncle Colonel Jupiter Parmenter (Rod McGaughy), his father General Thor Parmenter and his great-grandfather Major Hannibal Parmenter—who was with Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge. By contrast, Corporal Agarn&#x27;s great-grandfather was a deserter. Jeanette Nolan played Parmenter&#x27;s visiting mother (no first name given) in &quot;A Fort&#x27;s Best Friend is Not a Mother&quot;. When his sister Daphne Parmenter (Patty Regan) visits the fort, her eyes are on Private Dobbs. O&#x27;Rourke frequently calls Captain Parmenter &quot;the Old Man&quot; (in the sense that he is their leader) though Parmenter usually is surprised at being called that because he is fairly young (&quot;&quot;What&quot; old man?&quot;). In one episode, he receives a medal for accidentally capturing Chief Geronimo, who falls into a bear trap while trying to kill Corporal Agarn. (True to form, Parmenter captures the bear in the trap and then gets trapped in another bear trap.) In &quot;The Majority of Wilton&quot; (near the end of the series), he turns down a promotion to major because it would mean being reassigned to a new command and leaving F Troop.
* Sergeant Morgan Sylvester O&#x27;Rourke (Forrest Tucker) is the Sgt. Bilko of his day (as Agarn said to O&#x27;Rourke: &quot;When it comes to shifty, sneaky, double dealing ... you&#x27;re the tops&quot;). Originally from Steubenville, Ohio, he has been in the Army at least 25 years, and it took him either 10 years to become a sergeant or has been a sergeant for 22 years as of his 25th anniversary. O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s business dealings involve illegally running the local town saloon and an exclusive-rights treaty with the local Indian tribe (the Hekawi) to sell their &quot;authentic&quot; souvenirs to tourists and for the commercial market through the shady, undercover O&#x27;Rourke Enterprises operation. He also tries to find ways to fleece the men out of their pay through different schemes such as finding the men mail-order brides. Though most of his business schemes fail, he apparently is the only competent soldier in &quot;F Troop.&quot; O&#x27;Rourke is mentioned as a veteran of the Mexican–American War, but nothing is said about the Civil War. In &quot;The Sergeant and the Kid&quot;, the tall and rugged O&#x27;Rourke shows his romantic side by taking an interest in the widow Molly Walker (Pippa Scott) and her son Joey (Peter Robbins). In &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now, But One of Our Cannons is Missing,&quot; O&#x27;Rourke claims he saved Agarn&#x27;s life twice—once from drowning and once when a rattlesnake bit him. (Coincidentally, Forrest Tucker actually served in the U.S. Cavalry prior to World War II and played a similar &quot;O&#x27;Rourke&quot; cavalry sergeant on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.) Tucker&#x27;s wife at the time, Mary Fisk, appeared in the series twice. She played Squirrel Girl in &quot;Lieutenant O&#x27;Rourke, Front and Center&quot; and Kissing Squaw in &quot;What Are You Doing After the Massacre?&quot;. In one St Patrick&#x27;s day episode Forest Tucker played Sgt O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s father - a Stage Irishman who is just as much as conman as his son is.
* Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch) is O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s somewhat dimwitted sidekick and business partner in the shady O&#x27;Rourke Enterprises (his name is a play on both Randolph Scott and John Agar, who were cowboy stars). The character Agarn, originally from Passaic, New Jersey, took six years after enlistment to become a lowly corporal. At the time of the series, Agarn has been in the cavalry for 10 years, and has been posted to Fort Courage for the last four, apparently spending the Civil War years at Fort Courage. He has impersonated Generals George Washington and Ulysses Grant. However, in dual roles, Storch played numerous lookalike relatives of Agarn, including his French-Canadian cousin Lucky Pierre, his Russian cousin Dmitri Agarnoff and his Mexican bandito cousin Pancho Agarnado, known as &quot;El Diablo.&quot; (In the same episode he also played Granny Agarn, Uncle Gaylord Agarn of Tallahassee and Pancho&#x27;s sister Carmen Agarnado). Confrontational and often overly-emotional in every respect, Agarn frequently collapses in tears with the phrases &quot;Oh, Cap&#x27;n!&quot; or &quot;Oh, Sarge!&quot; (depending on whose chest he buries his head in). To get the men to attention, he barks out his trademark loud and exaggerated (but unintelligible) &quot;Aaaaa-aaahh&quot; command. Whenever he becomes frustrated by something one of the troopers does wrong (which is often), short-tempered Agarn hits him with his hat which, unlike everyone else&#x27;s, is grey Confederate army issue. A hypochondriac, Agarn thinks he has contracted the illnesses he reads or hears about or others around him have (including a horse). Agarn was briefly promoted to sergeant in the episode &quot;Lieutenant O&#x27;Rourke, Front and Center&quot;. Larry Storch was nominated for an Emmy Award for outstanding performance by an actor in a leading role in a comedy series in 1967.
* Bugler Private Hannibal Shirley Dobbs (James Hampton) is F Troop&#x27;s inept bugler, originally from New Orleans, who can only play &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; and &quot;Dixie&quot; with regularity. Standard U.S. Army tunes such as &quot;Reveille&quot;, &quot;Assembly&quot;, and &quot;Retreat&quot; are only occasionally played competently. One episode had him playing a song, which Wrangler Jane says is a lovely rendition of &quot;Old Kentucky Home&quot;, only for him to say he&#x27;d been trying to play &quot;Reveille&quot;. A southern &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot;, he is also Captain Parmenter&#x27;s orderly, as well as serving in the fort&#x27;s cannon crew—usually with disastrous results. Private Dobbs is a personal thorn in Agarn&#x27;s side, with his regular taunts resulting in Agarn&#x27;s frequent retort, &quot;I&#x27;m &quot;warning&quot; you, Dobbs!&quot;, even threatening him with a court-martial. Dobbs learned how to use a lasso on his mama&#x27;s alligator farm. Dobbs was briefly promoted to Corporal in the episode &quot;Lieutenant O&#x27;Rourke, Front and Center&quot;. In one episode O&#x27;Rourke saved Dobbs from being married by explaining to a gold-digging mail-order bride that Dobbs was not a rich man.
* Trooper Vanderbilt (Joe Brooks) is the fort&#x27;s lookout, who seems all but blind even with glasses (20/900 in each eye, according to Agarn) and answers questions from the lookout tower about what he sees with incongruous responses, such as &quot;No, thank you Agarn. I just had my coffee.&quot; He once allowed two Indians wearing feather head-dresses to enter the fort unchallenged. Asked why, he replied, &quot;I thought they were turkeys.&quot; In another episode he mistakes a flock of turkeys for attacking Indians. In one episode, he shoots his pistol in a crowded barracks—and manages to miss everyone. Vanderbilt was a bustle inspector in a dress factory before joining the Army. In the running gag that brings the lookout tower crashing to the ground, the heavyset Vanderbilt is the soldier who comes down with it.
* Trooper Duffy (Bob Steele) is an aged old-time cavalryman with a limp, the result of his &quot;old Alamo injury&quot; acting up again. Duffy claims to be the lone survivor of the siege of the Alamo in 1836, and loves to recount his exploits alongside Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, &quot;shoulder to shoulder and backs to the wall&quot; roughly 30 years before being in F Troop. (Steele was in fact a Western movie and serial star years earlier, even appearing in &quot;With Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo&quot; in 1926, some four decades before &quot;F Troop&quot;). However, no one ever seems to take his claim seriously, and he may be engaged in telling tall tales. Parmenter discovered that Duffy is listed as dead in his service record (as Sergeant O&#x27;Rourke noted to Captain Parmenter, Duffy&#x27;s service record might need some updating).

* &quot;Wrangler&quot; Jane Angelica Thrift (Melody Patterson) is Captain Wilton Parmenter&#x27;s beautiful but tomboyish, feisty, romantically aggressive Annie Oakley-like girlfriend, dressed in buckskins and a cowgirl hat. She owns Wrangler Jane&#x27;s Trading Post and runs the U.S. post office in town. She is a telegrapher and the best sharpshooter in the territory. Whenever the fort is attacked she fights alongside everyone else, usually shooting more Indians than everyone else. She is determined to marry the ever-romantically elusive and naïve Parmenter, and is often obliged to rescue him from his various predicaments. When she kisses the very bashful Parmenter, he usually says, &quot;Please, Jane, not in front of the men.&quot; In &quot;The Sergeant and the Kid&quot;, she replied back, &quot;But there&#x27;re no men here,&quot; to which he replied &quot;Well then, not in front of me.&quot; As part of this running gag, in the same episode after Jane mistakenly kisses Agarn, he says, &quot;Please Jane, not in front of the Captain.&quot; While Parmenter is reticent about showing any overt interest in Jane, he does become quite jealous if another man shows any interest in her. However, in &quot;Marriage, Fort Courage Style&quot; (one of the last episodes in the series), Parmenter finally shows a direct interest in Jane. He sets a date three months hence as the beginning of their engagement to be married (Parmenter explains the reason he has hesitated to marry Jane is that the Parmenters as military men are rather hard on their wives). The character had her own theme music; a banjo piece usually played on the soundtrack to cue her entrances, or initial appearance in each episode. For more on Melody Patterson see Development and Production section.

====The Hekawi tribe====
The Hekawi appear to be a very small tribe consisting of only one small village. They live an indeterminate distance from Fort Courage, though the directions to their camp are described as: &quot;Make right turn at big rock that look like bear, then make left turn at big bear that look like rock.” In &quot;Reunion for O&#x27;Rourke&quot;, Chief Wild Eagle explains how the tribe got its name: &quot;Many moons ago, tribe leave Massachusetts because Pilgrims ruin neighborhood! Tribe travel west, over stream, over river, over mountain, over mountain, over river, over stream! Then come big day... tribe fall over cliff. That when Hekawi get name. Medicine man say to my ancestor, &quot;I think we lost. Where the heck are we?&quot;. &quot;Where the heck are we?&quot; became &quot;We&#x27;re the Hekawi&quot; (the original name for the tribe in the series, &#x27;Fugawi&#x27;, was changed after the censors discovered the sentence &quot;Where the Fugawi?&quot;).

The Hekawis are often 50/50 partners with O&#x27;Rourke Enterprises. They make most of the company&#x27;s products, usually in the form of Indian souvenirs (on a commercial scale) and whiskey for the town saloon. They are a peace-loving tribe (mainly due to cowardice), and are self described as &quot;the tribe that invented the peace pipe,&quot; &quot;lovers, not fighters,&quot; and &quot;proud descendants of cowards.&quot; Profit minded, the Hekawis look to be paid when O&#x27;Rourke needs them to do something like orchestrate a fake attack on the fort, and haggle over the price and how many braves would be in the attack (when O&#x27;Rourke balks at the price, the Chief reminds him that the Apache will gladly make a real attack on the fort for free). Because it had been such a long time, though, since they had been on the &quot;warpath,&quot; when the series started, Agarn has to teach the Hekawis how to do a war dance, a clip of which was shown in the first-season opening credits. Anytime the tribe wants to contact the fort, they use smoke signals, which only O&#x27;Rourke can read. In one episode (and referred to in another), the Hekawis have a &quot;Playbrave Club&quot; (a parody of the Playboy Club) complete with go-go dancing and 1960s-style music.

As a sly jest based on the myth that Native Americans are the 13th tribe of Israel, many of the Hekawi Indians were played by veteran Yiddish comedians using classic Yiddish shtick. The regular Indian characters (none of whom were played by Native American actors) include:

* Chief Wild Eagle (Frank de Kova) is the shrewd, cranky, but essentially good-natured leader of the Hekawi tribe, and business partner in the shady O&#x27;Rourke Enterprises schemes (in &quot;Reunion for O&#x27;Rourke&quot; Wild Eagle says he has been chief for 17 years). In spite of his gruff appearance, Wild Eagle said: &quot;Don&#x27;t let name Wild Eagle fool you. I had changed it from Yellow Chicken&quot;. Like all the Indian characters portrayed in &quot;F Troop&quot;, he speaks with a mock American Indian accent in a semibroken English dialect stereotypical of American Westerns. Often, O&#x27;Rourke, Agarn, Parmenter, and Jane come to him for advice when they have a problem, and Wild Eagle has a wise old Indian saying for every occasion (such as &quot;Wise old Indian say you cannot make a fur coat out of a goose feather&quot;), which he often admits even he does not know the meaning of which or how it applies to the situation at hand. On differing occasions, he says he is the son of Crazy Horse, the brother-in-law of Sitting Bull, and the cousin of Geronimo. De Kova and the character of Chief Wild Eagle became important enough by the beginning of the second season as to merit listing in the show&#x27;s opening credits sequence.
* Crazy Cat (Don Diamond) is Chief Wild Eagle&#x27;s goofy assistant and heir apparent. He often speculates on when he will become chief, but is subsequently rebuked by Chief Wild Eagle. Appearing sporadically in the early first-season episodes, he became a regularly featured character later in the first season, as Roaring Chicken and Medicine Man were phased out of the series. &quot;Craze&quot; (as O&#x27;Rourke and Agarn sometimes call him) does become &quot;acting chief&quot; in the episode titled, &quot;Our Brave in F Troop&quot; (when O&#x27;Rourke and Agarn have to somehow sneak Wild Eagle into Fort Courage to see the Army dentist so he can get his tooth pulled). Crazy Cat humorously comments on the situation, &quot;When Wild Eagle away, Crazy Cat play.&quot;

===Recurring===
* Happy Bear/Smokey Bear (Ben Frommer) is an overweight, usually silent Hekawi brave in black braids and a fire ranger&#x27;s hat (a parody of Smokey Bear). In the first season, Frommer appears (usually uncredited) as Happy Bear, sometimes as Smokey Bear, once as Papa Bear, as Red Arrow, and a few times without a name. In the second season, he appears solely as Smokey Bear. Overall, Frommer appeared in 52 episodes.
* Trooper Duddleson (Ivan Bell) is a sleepy, slovenly, obese soldier, who is hit on the head repeatedly by Agarn for having his body in line, but not his belly, or sleeping when he is supposed to be at attention. He is sometimes upbraided by Agarn for having gravy stains on his shirt. Duddleson typically wears a printed piece of cloth instead of the standard yellow neckerchief. According to his service record, Duddleson was a female impersonator with a carnival in civilian life. He appears in 45 episodes.
* Trooper Hoffenmueller (John Mitchum) is a trooper who can either only speak in his native German or speaks English with a German accent, depending upon the episode. According to his service record, Hoffenmueller can speak Cherokee, Sioux, Apache, and Hekawi. &quot;We can use you as an interpreter ... just as soon as you learn to speak English&quot; —Capt. Parmenter. He appears in 11 episodes. Mitchum did make an uncredited cameo in the second-season episode &quot;The Day They Shot Agarn&quot; as the man singing the ballad (for which singing he &quot;was&quot; credited) of the same name. John Mitchum&#x27;s much more famous brother is tough-guy actor Robert Mitchum. 
* Stagecoach Driver (Rudy Doucette) briefly appears in seven episodes, including one as Slim.
* Roaring Chicken (Edward Everett Horton) is an ancient Hekawi medicine man and son of Sitting Duck. He appears in only six episodes in the first season, and he &quot;invented&quot; the RoarChick test (a parody of the Rorschach test). Longtime veteran actor Horton parodied the role on the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series as &quot;Chief Screaming Chicken&quot;. Horton was also the narrator of &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, a popular segment of the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; cartoon series. 
* Pete (Benny Baker), the bartender at the saloon, appears in five episodes.
* Charlie is the town drunk (veteran stuntman Harvey Parry and Frank McHugh). Fort Courage got Charlie from Dodge City. As Capt. Parmenter says: &quot;We were lucky to get him – Dodge had a spare&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re all proud of you Charlie; you&#x27;re the fastest drunk in the West&quot;. The role was created especially for Parry to show off his skills (he was in his 60s by then, but appears in only three episodes). In &quot;Will the Real Captain Try to Stand Up&quot;, Charlie (McHugh) temporarily pretends to be the captain of &quot;F Troop&quot;, while Charlie&#x27;s daughter, Cindy Charles (Linda Foster), is visiting because she thinks he actually is the captain of F Troop rather than the town drunk.
* Major Duncan (James Gregory) is Captain Parmenter&#x27;s superior from the territory headquarters, who usually &quot;brings a saddlebag full of trouble,&quot; according to O&#x27;Rourke. According to the episode &quot;Too Many Cooks Soil the Troop&quot;, Major Duncan had taken F Troop&#x27;s quartermaster, clerk, blacksmith, and cook as transfers to his own fort. Gregory appeared twice as Major Duncan and once as the land baron Big Jim Parker who bought the town and the land the fort sits on.
* Secretary of War (William Woodson) appears in three episodes.
* Trooper Leonard &quot;Wrongo&quot; Starr (Henry Gibson) is a jinxed soldier (the name is a play on Beatles drummer Ringo Starr). He appears in &quot;Wrongo Starr and the Lady in Black&quot; and in &quot;The Return of Wrongo Starr.&quot; Alternative explanations are given for the origin of the jinx.
* Medicine Man (J. Pat O&#x27;Malley) is an unnamed Hekawi &quot;doctor&quot;, who prescribes various tribal dances to treat diverse ailments. He appears in two episodes.

==Development and production==
Although the show&#x27;s opening credits claim &quot;F Troop&quot; was created by Richard Bluel, a final arbitration by the Writers Guild of America eventually gave Seaman Jacobs, Ed James, and Jim Barnett credit.

Episode writers included Arthur Julian (who, alone, wrote 29 of the 65 episodes; he also appeared as an undertaker in his &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; script), Stan Dreben (&quot;Green Acres&quot;), Seaman Jacobs, Howard Merrill (&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;), Ed James, Austin and Irma Kalish, and the highly successful comedy writing duo of Tom Adair and James B. Allardice, who collaborated on some of the most successful American TV sitcoms of the 1960s, including &quot;The Munsters&quot;; &quot;My Three Sons&quot;; &quot;Gomer Pyle, USMC&quot;, and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

The series was directed by Charles Rondeau and Leslie Goodwins, among many others, and produced by William T. Orr and Hy Averback. I. Stanford Jolley, Forrest Tucker&#x27;s former father-in-law, appeared as Colonel Ferguson in the 1966 episode &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;. The entire series was shot on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California.

The plot engine of O&#x27;Rourke and Agarn&#x27;s moneymaking schemes echoed that of an American television series of the late 1950s, &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, which had featured swindling by the wily Sergeant Bilko, also based at a &quot;peacetime&quot; Army base — albeit in the mid-20th century, although with the twist of involving local preindustrial aboriginals with US military men in money-making schemes. It also echoes some of the money-making schemes found in the American television series &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, which was written by some of the same writers from the &quot;Bilko&quot; show.

The concept of misfit troops sent out West bears some resemblance to the 1964 Western comedy &quot;Advance to the Rear&quot;.

Melody Patterson lied about her age to get the part of Wrangler Jane. She was 15 at the time of her audition, but turned 16 by the time filming started. As a result, the romance between Jane and Parmenter was kept very low key during the first season. By the time production of the second season started, Patterson had turned 17 and Parmenter&#x27;s affections were made stronger and Jane was made more sexually aggressive (Patterson was 10 days short of turning 18 when the last episode was aired).

The show&#x27;s ratings were still healthy after the second year (ranked number 40 out of 113 shows for the 1966–67 season, with a 31.3 share), but according to Tucker, Warner Bros.&#x27; new owners, Seven Arts, discontinued production because they thought it was wasteful for so much of the Warner Ranch to be taken up by a single half-hour TV show. Producer William Orr says the studio was also unhappy with the added costs of producing the show in color during its second season.

== Other media ==
Dell Comics published a seven-issue tie in series.

An illustrated hardcover book &quot;The Great Indian Uprising&quot; was published by Whitman in 1967. It was authored by William Johnston and illustrated by Larry Pelini.

A board game was published by Ideal Toy Company.

== Release ==

=== Broadcast and syndication ===

Although only two seasons were produced, &quot;F Troop&quot; enjoyed a healthy second life in syndication. The show was a particular favorite on Nick at Nite in the 1990s, running from 1991 to 1995 despite an archive of only 65 episodes. Reruns began airing on TV Land from 1997 to 2000, GoodLife TV Network in 2004, and on MeTV on September 2, 2013. Circle Country previously carried the show since 2020. In the United Kingdom, reruns commenced in October 2017 on Sky TV channel Forces TV.

Reruns premiered on the ITV network in the United Kingdom on October 29, 1968, and were screened repeatedly until July 16, 1974. The series was also broadcast nationally in Australia on ABC-TV, in Ireland on Telefís Éireann, and in Italy during the &#x27;80s as a &quot;filler&quot; show during summers (when ratings usually dropped due to large numbers of people going on holidays).

=== Home media ===
In 1998, 30 of the series&#x27; 65 episodes were digitally remastered and released on 10 VHS tapes by Columbia House.

On September 27, 2005, Warner Home Video released the first &quot;F Troop&quot; DVD compilation as part of its &quot;Television Favorites&quot; series. The six-episode DVD included three black-and-white episodes and three color episodes. Following the successful sales from the &quot;Television Favorites&quot; sampler release, Warner Home Video released &quot;F Troop: The Complete First Season,&quot; with all 34 black-and-white episodes included. &quot;The Complete Second Season&quot; of &quot;F Troop&quot; was released on DVD on May 29, 2007. Both seasons of this show have been released on DVD by Warner Home Video. The DVD features interviews with original &quot;F Troop&quot; members, writers, and other production personnel, as well as behind-the-scenes information. However, only one major actor from the series, Ken Berry, was interviewed for the half-hour special. Also, audio segments were included of an interview with actor Joe Brooks (Private Vanderbilt).

The complete series has been released on iTunes in both standard-definition and remastered high-definition television. For the high-definition remaster, the original film elements were rescanned into high-resolution video.

<text>Strine, also spelled Stryne (), is Australian slang for a broad Australian English accent. Someone who speaks Strine is called an Ocker. In contemporary Australian spoken English, the term &quot;Strine&quot; is being replaced by Strayan, a word gaining traction in more recent years (although Strine is still used among some populations). In written English, Strine remains more frequently used. 
The term is a syncope, derived from a shortened phonetic rendition of the pronunciation of the word &quot;Australian&quot; in an exaggerated Broad Australian accent, drawing upon the tendency of this accent to run syllables together in a form of liaison. 

The term was coined in 1964 when the accent was the subject of humorous columns published in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; from the mid-1960s. Alastair Ardoch Morrison, under the Strine pseudonym of Afferbeck Lauder (a metaplasm for &quot;Alphabetical Order&quot;), wrote a song &quot;With Air Chew&quot; (&quot;Without You&quot;) in 1965 followed by a series of books—&quot;Let Stalk Strine&quot; (1965), &quot;Nose Tone Unturned&quot; (1967), &quot;Fraffly Well Spoken&quot; (1968), and &quot;Fraffly Suite&quot; (1969). An example from one of the books: &quot;Eye-level arch play devoisters ...&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll have a large plate of oysters&quot;).

In 2009, Text Publishing, Melbourne, re-published all four books in an omnibus edition.

The late environmentalist and TV presenter Steve Irwin was once referred to as the person who &quot;talked Strine like no other contemporary personality&quot;.

<doc id="541163" wikidata="Q430057" url="?curid=541163" title="Arbutus">
<text>Arbutus is a genus of 12 accepted species of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, native to temperate regions of the Mediterranean, western Europe, the Canary Islands and North America, and commonly called madrones or strawberry trees. The name &quot;Arbutus&quot; was taken by taxonomists from Latin, where it referred to the species now designated &quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Arbutus&quot; are small trees or shrubs with red flaking bark and edible red berries. Fruit development is delayed for about five months after pollination, so that flowers appear while the previous year&#x27;s fruit are ripening. Peak flowering for the genus is in April with peak fruiting in October.

===History===
The smooth wood of the tree is mentioned by Theophrastus in his &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; (&quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;) as formerly being used to make weaving spindles. An article on Arbutus tree cultivation in al-Andalus (in ) is brought down in Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam&#x27;s 12th-century agricultural work, &quot;Book on Agriculture&quot;.

==Common names==

Members of the genus are called &quot;madrones&quot; or &quot;madronas&quot; in the United States, from the Spanish name &quot;madroño&quot; (strawberry tree). On the south coast of British Columbia, Canada, where the species is common, &quot;arbutus&quot; is commonly used or, rarely and locally, &quot;tick tree&quot;. All refer to the same species, &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;, native to the Pacific Northwest and Northern and Central California regions. It is Canada&#x27;s only native broadleaved evergreen tree. Some species in the genera &quot;Epigaea&quot;, &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; and &quot;Gaultheria&quot; were formerly classified in &quot;Arbutus&quot;. As a result of its past classification, &quot;Epigaea repens&quot; (mayflower) has an alternative common name of &quot;trailing arbutus&quot;.

==Systematics==
A study published in 2001 which analyzed ribosomal DNA from &quot;Arbutus&quot; and related genera suggests that &quot;Arbutus&quot; is paraphyletic and the Mediterranean Basin species of &quot;Arbutus&quot; are more closely related to &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;, &quot;Arctous&quot;, &quot;Comarostaphylis&quot;, &quot;Ornithostaphylos&quot; and &quot;Xylococcus&quot; than to the western North American species of &quot;Arbutus&quot;, and that the split between the two groups of species occurred at the Paleogene/Neogene boundary. The 12 species are as follows:

===Afro-Eurasia===
* &quot;Arbutus andrachne&quot; – Greek strawberry tree (Southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia)
* &quot;Arbutus canariensis&quot; – Canary madrone (Canary Islands)
* &quot;Arbutus pavarii&quot; (Libya)
* &quot;Arbutus unedo&quot; – strawberry tree (Mediterranean Basin, western France, and western Ireland)

===Americas===
* &quot;Arbutus arizonica&quot; – Arizona madrone (New Mexico, Arizona and western Mexico south to Jalisco)
* &quot;Arbutus bicolor&quot; (Mexico)
* &quot;Arbutus madrensis&quot; – western Mexico
* &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot; – Pacific madrone (West coast of North America from southern British Columbia to central (less frequently southern) California, on the west slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Pacific Coast Range mountains)
* &quot;Arbutus mollis&quot; (Mexico)
* &quot;Arbutus occidentalis&quot; - western Mexico
* &quot;Arbutus tessellata&quot; (Mexico)
* &quot;Arbutus xalapensis&quot; (syn. &quot;A. texana&quot;, &quot;A. glandulosa&quot;, &quot;A. peninsularis&quot;) – Texas madrone (Texas, New Mexico and northeastern Mexico)

===Hybrids===
* &quot;Arbutus&quot; × &quot;andrachnoides&quot; (&quot;A. andrachne × A. unedo&quot;): this hybrid has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.
* &quot;Arbutus&quot; × &quot;androsterilis&quot; (&quot;A. canariensis&quot; × &quot;A. unedo&quot;) in Canary Islands 
* &quot;Arbutus&quot; × &quot;thuretiana&quot; (&quot;A. andrachne&quot; × &quot;A. canariensis&quot;)
* &quot;Arbutus&quot; × &quot;reyorum&quot; [ (&quot;A. andrachne&quot; × &quot;A. canariensis&quot;) × &quot;A. unedo&quot; ]

===Formerly placed here===
*&quot;Arctostaphylos tomentosa&quot; (as &quot;A. tomentosa&quot; )
*&quot;Arctostaphylos uva-ursi&quot; (as &quot;A. uva-ursi&quot; )
*&quot;Comarostaphylis discolor&quot; (as &quot;A. discolor&quot; )
*&quot;Gaultheria phillyreifolia&quot; (as &quot;A. phillyreifolia&quot; )

==Natural history==
&quot;Arbutus&quot; species are used as food plants by some Lepidoptera species including emperor moth, &quot;Pavonia pavonia&quot; and the madrone butterfly. The distribution of the latter species is in fact heavily affected by the distribution of the madrone. For Athenaios, it is the tree which Asclepiades of Myrlea talks about (Deiphnosophists, II.35)

==Uses and symbolism==

Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants outside of their natural ranges, though cultivation is often difficult due to their intolerance of root disturbance. The hybrid &quot;Arbutus&quot; &#x27;Marina&#x27; is much more adaptable and thrives under garden conditions.

The &quot;Arbutus unedo&quot; tree makes up part of the coat of arms (, The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city of Madrid, Spain. A statue of a bear eating the fruit of the madroño tree stands in the center of the city (Puerta del Sol). The image appears on city crests, taxi cabs, man-hole covers, and other city infrastructure.

The &quot;Arbutus&quot; is important to the Straits Salish people of Vancouver Island, who used arbutus bark and leaves to create medicines for colds, stomach problems, and tuberculosis, and as the basis for contraceptives. The tree also figures in myths of the Straits Salish.

The fruit is edible but has minimal flavour and is not widely eaten. In Portugal, the fruit is sometimes distilled (legally or not) into a potent brandy known as &quot;medronho&quot;. In Madrid, the fruit is distilled into madroño, a sweet, fruity liqueur.

&quot;Arbutus&quot; is a good fuelwood tree since it burns hot and long. Many Pacific Northwest states in the United States use the wood of &quot;A. menziesii&quot; primarily as a heat source, as the wood holds no value in the production of homes since it does not grow in straight timbers.

The Saanich people of British Columbia have a prohibition against burning arbutus, due to its salvific role in their creation myths; an arbutus anchored their canoes to the world during the deluge.

&quot;My love&#x27;s an arbutus&quot; is the title of a poem by the Irish writer Alfred Perceval Graves (1846–1931), set to music by his compatriot Charles Villiers Stanford (1852–1924).

The Canadian songwriter, singer and painter Joni Mitchell (born 1943) includes a reference to the &quot;arbutus rustling&quot; in her song, &quot;For The Roses&quot;. It sounded like applause. She calls the arbutus tree her &quot;favorite all-time tree&quot;. She had one outside her door in a house she built.

&quot;I love arbutuses,&quot; celebrated French chef Alain Ducasse, recipient of 20 Michelin stars, has said(24:50). &quot;Yes, I love arbutus honey. It&#x27;s sweet honey that&#x27;s also bitter. I&#x27;m obsessed with the bitterness.&quot;

==Cultural significance==
According to the Straits Salish, an anthropomorphic form of pitch would go fishing, but return to shore before it got too hot. One day he was too late getting back to shore and melted from the heat and several anthropomorphic trees rushed to get him – the first was Douglas fir, who took most of the pitch, the grand fir received a small portion, and the madrone received none – which is why they say it still has no pitch.

Also, according to the Great Flood legends of several bands in the northwest, the madrone helped people survive by providing an anchor on top of a mountain for their canoes. Because of this the Saanich people do not burn madrone out of thanks for saving them.

<doc id="541172" wikidata="Q31958" url="?curid=541172" title="Chestnut-headed bee-eater">
<text>The chestnut-headed bee-eater (Merops leschenaulti), or bay-headed bee-eater, is a bird in the bee-eater family Meropidae. It breeds on the Indian subcontinent and adjoining regions, ranging from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka across Southeast Asia to Indonesia.

This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green, with blue on the rump and lower belly. Its face and throat are yellow with a black eye stripe, and the crown and nape are rich chestnut. The thin curved bill is black. Sexes are alike, but young birds are duller. It is 18–20 cm long and lacks the two elongated central tail feathers possessed by most of its relatives.

==Taxonomy==
The chestnut-headed bee-eater was formally described in 1817 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot under the current binomial name &quot;Merops leschenaulti&quot;. He specified the locality as Java. This was an error as this species does not occur there and the locality has been designated as Sri Lanka. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the French naturalist and collector Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour who had brought Vieillot&#x27;s specimen to France.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. l. leschenaulti&quot; Vieillot, 1817 – India and Sri Lanka to central south China, Indochina and Malay Peninsula
* &quot;M. l. quinticolor&quot; Vieillot, 1817 – far south Sumatra, Java and Bali
* &quot;M. l. andamanensis&quot; Marien, 1950 – Andaman Islands

==Description==

The chestnut-headed bee-eater is in overall length and weighs . The sexes are similar in appearance. The forehead, crown, nape, and are bright chestnut. The lores are black, continued as a thin band under the eye and ear-coverts. The , lower back and are green, the latter are tipped with bluish. The and are pale shining blue. The and are green, rufous on the inner webs, and all tipped dusky. The central tail-feathers are bluish on the outer, and green on the inner webs; the others are green, margined on the inner web with brown and all tipped dusky. The sides of the face, chin and throat are yellow; below this a broad band of chestnut extending to the sides of the neck and meeting the chestnut of the upper plumage; below this again is a formed by a short distinct band of black and then an ill-defined band of yellow. The remainder of lower plumage is green tipped with blue, especially on the and . The iris is red, the bill is black, the legs are dusky black and the claws dark horn-colour. The juveniles are like the adult but duller. They a green forehead, forecrown and . The lower throat is yellow rather than chestnut and the gorget band is indistinct. The breast and belly are paler and more olive in colour than the adult.

The Javan sub-species, &quot;M. l. quinticolor&quot;, differs in having the space from the bill down to the black pectoral band pure yellow without any chestnut, and in having an entirely blue tail. Race &quot;andamanensis&quot; found in the Andamans is slightly larger than the Indian race. 

==Distribution and habitat==

This is a bird which breeds in sub-tropical open woodland, often near water. It is most common in highland areas.

==Behaviour==
These birds are gregarious and feed and roost communally.

===Breeding===
Chestnut-headed bee-eaters usually nest in small colonies in sandy banks. They make a relatively long tunnel in which the five to six spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs and feed the young.

===Food and feeding===
As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch.

<doc id="541197" wikidata="Q416025" url="?curid=541197" title="Misoprostol">
<text>Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin medication used to prevent and treat stomach and duodenal ulcers, induce labor, cause an abortion, and treat postpartum bleeding due to poor contraction of the uterus. It is taken by mouth when used to prevent gastric ulcers in people taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). For abortions it is used by itself or in conjunction with mifepristone or methotrexate. By itself, effectiveness for abortion is between 66% and 90%. For labor induction or abortion, it is taken by mouth, dissolved in the mouth, or placed in the vagina. For postpartum bleeding it may also be used rectally.
Common side effects include diarrhea and abdominal pain. It is in pregnancy category X, meaning that it is known to result in negative outcomes for the fetus if taken during pregnancy. In rare cases, uterine rupture may occur. It is a prostaglandin analogue—specifically, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).
Misoprostol was developed in 1973. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==

===Ulcer prevention===
Misoprostol is used for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. It acts upon gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid by G-protein coupled receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels and decreased proton pump activity at the apical surface of the parietal cell. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of gastric ulceration (e.g., with diclofenac in &quot;Arthrotec&quot;).

However, even in the treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers, omeprazole proved to be at least as effective as misoprostol, but was significantly better tolerated, so misoprostol should not be considered a first-line treatment. Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need for multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.

===Labor induction===
Misoprostol is commonly used for labor induction. It causes uterine contractions and the ripening (effacement or thinning) of the cervix. It can be less expensive than the other commonly used ripening agent, dinoprostone.

Oxytocin has long been used as the standard agent for labor induction, but does not work well when the cervix is not yet ripe. Misoprostol also may be used in conjunction with oxytocin.

Between 2002 and 2012, a misoprostol vaginal insert was studied, and was approved in the EU. It was not approved for use in the United States, and the US FDA still considers cervical ripening and labor induction to be outside of the approved uses for misoprostol.

===Myomectomy===
When administered prior to myomectomy in women with uterine fibroids, misoprostol reduces operative blood loss and requirement of blood transfusion.

===Abortion===
Misoprostol is used either alone or in conjunction with another medication (mifepristone or methotrexate) for medical abortions as an alternative to surgical abortion. Medical abortion has the advantage of being less invasive, and more autonomous, self-directed, and discreet. It is preferred by some women because it feels more natural, as the drugs induce a miscarriage. It is also more easily accessible in places where abortion is illegal. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides clear guidelines on the use, benefits and risks of misoprostol for abortions.

Misoprostol is most effective when it is used in combination with methotrexate or mifepristone (RU-486). Mifepristone blocks signaling by progesterone, causing the uterine lining to degrade, the blood vessels of the cervix and uterus to dilate and causing uterine contraction, similar to a menstrual period, which causes the embryo to detach from the uterine walls. Misoprostol then dilates the cervix and induces muscle contractions which clear the uterus. Misoprostol alone is less effective (typically 88% up to eight-weeks gestation). It is not inherently unsafe if medically supervised, but 1% of women will have heavy bleeding requiring medical attention, some women may have ectopic pregnancy, and the 12% of pregnancies that continue after misoprostol failure are more likely to have birth defects and are usually followed up with a more effective method of abortion.

Most large studies recommend a protocol for the use of misoprostol in combination with mifepristone. Together they are effective in around 95% for early pregnancies. Misoprostol alone may be more effective in earlier gestation.

Misoprostol can also be used to dilate the cervix in preparation for a surgical abortion, particularly in the second trimester (either alone or in combination with osmotic dilators).

Misoprostol by mouth is the least effective treatment for producing complete abortion in a period of 24 hours due to the liver&#x27;s first-pass effect which reduces the bioavailability of the misoprostol. Vaginal and sublingual routes result in greater efficacy and extended duration of action because these routes of administration allow the drug to be directly absorbed into circulation by bypassing the liver first-pass effect.

Hematocrit or Hb tests and Rh testing are recommended before use for abortion confirmation of pregnancy. Following use, it is recommended that people attend a follow-up visit 2 weeks after treatment. If used for treatment of complete abortion, a pregnancy test, physical examination of the uterus, and ultrasound should be performed to ensure success of treatment. Surgical management is possible in the case of failed treatment.

===Early pregnancy loss===
Misoprostol may be used to complete a miscarriage or missed abortion when the body does not expel the embryo or fetus on its own. Compared to no medication or placebo, it could decrease the time to complete expulsion. Use of a single dose of misoprostol vaginally or buccally is preferred, with additional doses as needed. It also can be used in combination with mifepristone, with a similar regimen to medical abortion.

Misoprostol is regularly used in some Canadian hospitals for labour induction for fetal deaths early in pregnancy, and for termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. A low dose is used initially, then doubled for the remaining doses until delivery. In the case of a previous Caesarian section, however, lower doses are used.

===Postpartum bleeding===
Misoprostol is also used to prevent and treat post-partum bleeding. Orally administered misoprostol was marginally less effective than oxytocin. The use of rectally administered misoprostol is optimal in cases of bleeding; it was shown to be associated with lower rates of side effects compared to other routes. Rectally administered misoprostol was reported in a variety of case reports and randomised controlled trials. However, it is inexpensive and thermostable (thus does not require refrigeration like oxytocin), making it a cost-effective and valuable drug to use in the developing world. A randomised control trial of misoprostol use found a 38% reduction in maternal deaths due to &quot;post partum&quot; haemorrhage in resource-poor communities. Misoprostol is recommended due to its cost, effectiveness, stability, and low rate of side effects. Oxytocin must also be given by injection, while misprostol can be given orally or rectally for this use, making it much more useful in areas where nurses and physicians are less available.

===Insertion of intrauterine contraceptive device===
In women with prior caesarean section or prior failure of insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device, pre-procedure administration of misoprostol reduces the rate of failure of insertion of intrauterine contraceptive device. However, due to a higher rate of adverse effects, routine use of misoprostol for this purpose in other women is not supported by the data.

===Other===
For cervical ripening in advance of endometrial biopsy to reduce the need for use of a tenaculum or cervical dilator.

There is limited evidence supporting the use of misoprostol for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in patients with multiple sclerosis.

==Adverse effects==
The most commonly reported adverse effect of taking misoprostol by mouth for the prevention of stomach ulcers is diarrhea. In clinical trials, an average 13% of people reported diarrhea, which was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days) and was usually self-limiting (often resolving within 8 days), but sometimes (in 2% of people) required discontinuation of misoprostol.

The next most commonly reported adverse effects of taking misoprostol by mouth for the prevention of gastric ulcers are: abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, headache, dyspepsia, vomiting, and constipation, but none of these adverse effects occurred more often than when taking placebos.

There are increased side effects with sublingual or oral misoprostol, compared to a low dose (400 μg) vaginal misoprostol. However, low dose vaginal misoprostol was linked with low complete abortion rate. The study concluded that sublingually administered misoprostol dosed at 600 μg or 400 μg had greater instances of fever and diarrhea due to its quicker onset of action, higher peak concentration and bioavailability in comparison to vaginal or oral misoprostol.

For the indication of medical abortion, bleeding and cramping is commonly experienced after administration of misoprostol. Bleeding and cramping is likely to be greater than that experienced with menses, however, emergency care is advised if bleeding is excessive.

Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women with wanted pregnancies to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers because it increases uterine tone and contractions in pregnancy, which may cause partial or complete abortions, and because its use in pregnancy has been associated with birth defects.

All cervical ripening and induction agents can cause uterine hyperstimulation, which can negatively affect the blood supply to the fetus and increases the risk of complications such as uterine rupture. Concern has been raised that uterine hyperstimulation that occurs during a misoprostol-induced labor is more difficult to treat than hyperstimulation during labors induced by other drugs. Because the complications are rare, it is difficult to determine if misoprostol causes a higher risk than do other cervical ripening agents. One estimate is that it would require around 61,000 people enrolled in randomized controlled trials to detect a difference in serious fetal complications and about 155,000 people to detect a difference in serious maternal complications.

==Contraindications==
It is recommended that medical treatment for missed abortion with misoprostol should only be considered in people without the following contraindications: suspected ectopic pregnancy, use of non-steroidal drugs, signs of pelvic infections or sepsis, unstable hemodynamics, known allergy to misoprostol, previous caesarean section, mitral stenosis, hypertension, glaucoma, bronchial asthma, and remote areas without a hospital nearby.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue, binds to myometrial cells to cause strong myometrial contractions leading to expulsion of tissue. This agent also causes cervical ripening with softening and dilation of the cervix. Misoprostol binds to and stimulates prostaglandin EP2 receptors, prostaglandin EP3 receptor and prostaglandin EP4 receptor but not prostaglandin EP1 receptor and therefore is expected to have a more restricted range of physiological and potentially toxic actions than prostaglandin E2 or other analogs which activate all four prostaglandin receptors.

==Society and culture==
In August 2000, a letter from G.D. Searle, LLC, the inventor of the drug, generated controversy by warning against its use by pregnant women because of its ability to induce abortion, citing reports of maternal and fetal deaths when it was used to induce labor. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists holds that substantial evidence supports the use of misoprostol for induction of labor, a position it reaffirmed in response to the Searle letter. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

A vaginal form of the medication is sold in the EU under the names Misodel and Mysodelle for use in labor induction.

===Black market===
Misoprostol is used for self-induced abortions in Brazil, where black market prices exceed US$100 per dose. Illegal medically unsupervised misoprostol abortions in Brazil are associated with a lower complication rate than other forms of illegal self-induced abortion, but are still associated with a higher complication rate than legal, medically supervised surgical and medical abortions. Failed misoprostol abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases. Low-income and immigrant populations in New York City have also been observed to use self-administered misoprostol to induce abortions, as this method is much cheaper than a surgical abortion (about $2 per dose). The drug is readily available in Mexico. Use of misoprostol has also increased in Texas in response to increased regulation of abortion providers. Following the United States Supreme Court decision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization, many states restricted access to legal abortion services, including medication abortion using misoprostol. As a result of these restrictions, it was reported that there was an increase in self-managed abortions by women in the United States. Many women purchased the pills from overseas online pharmacies or obtained misoprostol from Mexico.

<doc id="541223" wikidata="Q564538" url="?curid=541223" title="Dead on arrival">
<text>Dead on arrival (DOA), also dead in the field, brought in dead (BID), or dead right there (DRT) are terms which indicate that a patient was found to be already clinically dead upon the arrival of professional medical assistance, often in the form of first responders such as emergency medical technicians, paramedics, firefighters, or police. 

In some jurisdictions, first responders must consult verbally with a physician before officially pronouncing a patient deceased, but once cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated, it must be continued until a physician can pronounce the patient dead. Dead on arrival can also mean that a person is said by a doctor to be dead upon their arrival at a hospital, emergency room, clinic, or ward. A person can be pronounced dead on arrival if cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is found to be futile.

==Medical DOA==
When presented with a patient, medical professionals are required to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) unless specific conditions are met that allow them to pronounce the patient as deceased. In most places, these are examples of such criteria:
* Injuries that are incompatible with life. These include but are not necessarily limited to decapitation, catastrophic brain trauma, incineration, gross dismemberment, or injuries that do not permit effective administration of CPR. If a patient has sustained such injuries, it should be intuitively obvious that the patient is non-viable. 
* &quot;Rigor mortis&quot;, indicating that the patient has been dead for at least a few hours. &quot;Rigor mortis&quot; can sometimes be difficult to determine, so it is often reported along with other determining factors.
* Obvious decomposition
* &quot;Livor mortis&quot; (lividity), indicating that the body has been pulseless and in the same position long enough for blood to sink and collect within the body, creating purplish discolorations at the lowest points of the body (with respect to gravity)
* Stillbirth. If it can be determined without a doubt that an infant died prior to birth, as indicated by skin blisters, an unusually soft head, and an extremely offensive odor, resuscitation should not be attempted. If there is even the slightest hope that the infant is viable, CPR should be initiated; some jurisdictions maintain that life-saving efforts should be attempted on all infants to assure parents that all possible actions were performed to save their child, futile as the medical professionals may have known them to be. 
* Identification of valid do not resuscitate orders

This list may not be a comprehensive picture of medical practice in all jurisdictions or conditions. For example, it may not represent the standard of care for patients with terminal diseases such as advanced cancer. In addition, jurisdictions such as Texas permit withdrawal of medical care from patients who are deemed unlikely to recover. 

Regardless of the patient, a pronouncement of death must always be made with absolute certainty and only after it has been determined that the patient is not a candidate for resuscitation. This type of decision is rather sensitive and can be difficult to make.

Legal definitions of death vary from place to place; for example, irreversible brain-stem death, prolonged clinical death, etc.

==Colloquial use==
*When, as with computers, product complexity is high and diagnostics are involved, the medical metaphor is perhaps appropriate, as complex diagnostics might be required to determine if the product &quot;is really dead&quot;.
*This term is also commonly applied to consumer electronics or other products that are defective straight out of the box, meaning they don&#x27;t function properly from the moment they&#x27;re unpacked or turned on for the first time.
*In another context, &quot;dead on arrival&quot; may be used to describe an idea, concept, or product that is considered to be fundamentally flawed, and therefore viewed as an utter failure from the start.
*In politics, the term is often used to describe incumbent politicians who are believed to have little or no chance of re-election.

<doc id="541239" wikidata="Q275033" url="?curid=541239" title="Entertainment Weekly">
<text>Entertainment Weekly (sometimes abbreviated as EW) is an American digital-only entertainment magazine based in New York City, published by Dotdash Meredith, that covers film, television, music, Broadway theatre, books, and popular culture. The print magazine debuted on February 16, 1990, in New York City, and ceased publication in 2022. 

Different from celebrity-focused publications such as &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, &quot;People&quot; (a sister magazine to &quot;EW&quot;), and &quot;In Touch Weekly&quot;, &quot;EW&quot; primarily concentrates on entertainment media news and critical reviews; unlike &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, which were primarily established as trade magazines aimed at industry insiders, &quot;EW&quot; targets a more general audience.

==History==
Formed as a sister magazine to &quot;People&quot;, the first issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was published on February 16, 1990.

Created by Jeff Jarvis and founded by Michael Klingensmith, who served as publisher until October 1996, the magazine&#x27;s original television advertising soliciting pre-publication subscribers portrayed it as a consumer guide to popular culture, including movies, music, and book reviews, sometimes with video game and stage reviews, too.

In 1996, the magazine won the coveted National Magazine Award for General Excellence from the American Society of Magazine Editors. &quot;EW&quot; won the same award again in 2002.

In September 2016, in collaboration with &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; launched the People/Entertainment Weekly Network. The network is &quot;a free, ad-supported, online-video network [that] carries short- and long-form programming covering celebrities, pop culture, lifestyle, and human-interest stories&quot;. It was rebranded as PeopleTV in September 2017.

Beginning with the August 2019 issue, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; transitioned to a monthly issue model.

Bruce Gersh, president of the Meredith entertainment division, which includes both &quot;EW&quot; and &quot;People&quot;, said that the cutback in print would be accompanied by deeper 24/7 digital coverage. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; would still produce weekly digital &quot;covers&quot; and push into podcasts, and planned events and experiential offerings with stars and festivals.

JD Heyman, deputy editor of &quot;People&quot;, replaced Henry Goldblatt as editor. As a result of the change, about 15 people were cut. Previous owner Time Inc. spent $150 million developing &quot;EW&quot; after its February 1990 launch, and was rewarded for its patience when the magazine made a six-figure profit at the end of 1996, and in its peak years was cranking out $55 million in annual profit.

Though still profitable before the switch to being monthly, &quot;EW&quot; was squeezed in recent years as celebrity coverage exploded across all platforms, and print advertising shrank. While still called a &quot;weekly&quot; before the switch, it was publishing only 34 issues a year. Meredith, after completing its $2.8 billion acquisition of Time Inc., considered selling the title, along with several others, but was convinced to keep &quot;EW&quot; in part because it was so intertwined with top money-maker &quot;People&quot;.

On August 2, 2021, the site of the Greek edition of the magazine was launched, Greece being the first country outside the U.S. in which the magazine would be available.

On February 9, 2022, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ceased print publication and moved to digital-only. The final print issue was that of April 2022. In May 2022, executive editor Patrick Gomez stepped into the editor-in-chief/general manager role.

==Typical content and frequency==

The magazine features celebrities on the cover and addresses topics such as television ratings, movie grosses, production costs, concert ticket sales, advertising budgets, and in-depth articles about scheduling, producers, showrunners, etc.

By the time print publication ceased, the magazine was published once per month, although the legacy name &quot;Entertainment&quot; &quot;Weekly&quot; is still used.

===Layout===
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; follows a typical magazine format by featuring a letter to the editor and a table of contents in the first few pages, while also featuring advertisements. While many advertisements are unrelated to the entertainment industry, most ads are typically related to up-and-coming television, film, or music events.

==== News and notes ====
These beginning articles open the magazine and as a rule focus on current events in pop culture. The whole section typically runs eight to ten pages long, and features short news articles and several specific recurring sections:

*&quot;Sound Bites&quot; usually opens the magazine. It is a collage of media personalities, actors, presenters, or comedians, alongside their recent memorable quotes in speech bubble form.
*&quot;The Must List&quot; is a two-page spread highlighting 10 things (books, movies, songs, etc.) that the staff loves from the week; it usually features one pick from &quot;EW&quot; readers.
*&quot;First Look&quot;, subtitled &quot;An early peek at some of Hollywood&#x27;s coolest projects&quot;, is a two-page spread with behind-the-scenes or publicity stills of upcoming movies, television episodes, or music events.
*&quot;The Hit List&quot;, written each week by critic Scott Brown, highlights 10 major events, with short comedic commentaries by Brown. Typically, some continuity to the commentaries exists. This column was originally written by Jim Mullen and featured 20 events each week, and Dalton Ross later wrote an abbreviated version.
*&quot;The Hollywood Insider&quot; is a one-page section that reports breaking news in entertainment. It gives details, in separate columns, on the most-current news in television, movies, and music.
*&quot;The Style Report&quot; is a one-page section devoted to celebrity style. Because its focus is on celebrity fashion or lifestyle, it is graphically rich in nature, featuring many photographs or other images. The page converted to a new format: five pictures of celebrity fashions for the week, graded on the magazine&#x27;s review &quot;A&quot;-to-&quot;F&quot; scale &quot;(see Reviews section below)&quot;. A spin-off section, &quot;Style Hunter&quot;, which finds reader-requested articles of clothing or accessories that have appeared in pop culture recently, appears frequently.
*&quot;The Monitor&quot; is a two-page spread devoted to major events in celebrity lives with small paragraphs highlighting events such as weddings, illnesses, arrests, court appearances, and deaths. Deaths of major celebrities are typically detailed in a one-half- or full-page obituary titled &quot;Legacy&quot;. This feature is nearly identical to sister publication &quot;People&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Passages&quot; feature.
*The &quot;celebrity&quot; column, the final section of &quot;News and Notes&quot;, is devoted to a different column each week, written by two of the magazine&#x27;s more-prominent writers:
**&quot;The Final Cut&quot; is written by former executive editor and author Mark Harris. Harris&#x27; column focuses on analyzing current popular-culture events, and is generally the most serious of the columns. Harris has written about the writer&#x27;s strike and the 2008 presidential election, among other topics.
**&quot;Binge Thinking&quot; was written by screenwriter Diablo Cody. After several profiles of Cody in the months leading up to and following the release of her debut film, &quot;Juno&quot; (2007), she was hired to write a column detailing her unique view of the entertainment business.
**If You Ask Me...&quot; Libby Gelman-Waxer (Paul Rudnick) was brought in to write his former &quot;Premiere&quot; column for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2011.

====Feature articles====
Typically, four to six major articles (one to two pages each) fill the middle pages of the magazine. These articles are most commonly interviews, but also it has narrative articles and lists. Feature articles tend to focus mostly on movies, music, and television and less on books and the theatre. In the magazine&#x27;s history, only a few cover stories (e.g., John Grisham, Stephen King) were devoted to authors; a cover has never been solely devoted to the theater.

====Reviews====
Seven sections of reviews are in the back pages of each issue (together encompassing up to one-half of the magazine&#x27;s pages). In addition to reviews, each reviews section has a top-sellers list, as well as numerous sidebars with interviews or small features. Unlike a number of European magazines that give their ratings with a number of stars (with normally 4 or 5 stars for the best review), &quot;EW&quot; grades the reviews academic-style, so that the highest reviews get a letter grade of &quot;A&quot; and the lowest reviews get an &quot;F&quot;, with plus or minus graduations in between assigned to each letter except &quot;F&quot;.

The sections are:
;&quot;Movies&quot;: Typically, this section features all the major releases for that weekend, as well as several independent and foreign films that have also been released. Chris Nashawaty is the primary film critic. &quot;Critical Mass&quot; was a table of the grades that have also been given by a number of noted movie reviewers in the American press (such as Ty Burr from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Todd McCarthy from &quot;Variety&quot;, and Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;). Also eliminated from this section was the box-office figures from the previous weekend and some sort of infographics. The A+ rating is rarely awarded by &quot;EW&quot;. Two films to have received it are &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989). DVDs are now profiled in the one-page &quot;Movies on DVD&quot; section that follows. Longtime critic Lisa Schwarzbaum left the magazine in 2013, and critic Owen Gleiberman was let go after a round of layoffs in spring 2014. In 2015, it started publishing the scores of movies from Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb under &quot;Critical Mass.&quot;

;&quot;Television&quot;: This section features reviews by critics Darren Franich and Kristen Baldwin for made-for-television films and new television programs or series, as well as some television specials. The section no longer includes the Nielsen ratings for the previous week. On the following page is typically a &quot;TV on DVD&quot; section, profiling releases of television films and specials or complete seasons of television shows. Current reviewers include Melissa Maerz.

;&quot;What to Watch&quot;: Currently written by Ray Rahman, this features brief, one- or two-sentence reviews of several television programs on each night of the week, as well as one slightly longer review, usually written by someone else, with a letter grade.

;&quot;Music&quot;: This section reviews major album releases for the week, divided by genre. Typically, at least one interview or feature is presented, as well as a section called &quot;Download This&quot;, highlighting several singles available for download from the Internet.

;&quot;Books&quot;: This section features reviews of books released during the week. Sometimes, authors write guest reviews of other works. Typically, one interview or spotlight feature is included in this section per issue. Bestseller lists appear at the end of this section.

;&quot;Theater&quot;*: Reviews productions currently playing, listed by the city where they are running

;&quot;Games&quot;*: Reviews current video game releases

;&quot;Tech&quot;*: Reviews new websites and products, and profiles current Internet or technology phenomena

:* &quot;Not in every issue.&quot;

====The Bullseye====
This section occupies the back page of the magazine, rating the &quot;hits&quot; and &quot;misses&quot; from the past week&#x27;s events in popular culture on a bullseye graphic. For example, the May 22, 2009, edition featured Justin Timberlake hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the center, while the then-drama between Eminem and Mariah Carey missed the target completely for being &quot;very 2002&quot;. At the time when this was printed on a small part of a page, events that were greatly disliked were shown several pages away.

===Specialty issues===
Every year, the magazine publishes several specialty issues. These issues were often published as double issues (running for two consecutive weeks). Many times these features were so long that they replaced all other feature articles.

Common specialty issues include:

* Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter Preview issues: Generally each quarter, the magazine reports on upcoming releases in movies, music, television, live shows, and books. Typically, the summer issue&#x27;s focus is on upcoming movies only unless major television series or events, music releases, or book releases are occurring then.
* The Photo issue: Once a year, an issue is dedicated to featuring (aside from the normal reviews and news content) only photographs of celebrities. Unlike tabloid issues, these photographs are done with the celebrities&#x27; cooperation, and often they use some form of artistic expression. A wide variety of celebrities has been used, including Green Day, Reese Witherspoon, Morrissey, the cast of the television series &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, Tobey Maguire, and Cameron Diaz. Generally, the photographs contain some descriptive text, sometimes about the person or sometimes a commentary from the photographers who photographed them for a story.
* Academy Awards issues: In the past, the magazine devoted at least four cover stories per year to the Academy Awards; &quot;The Oscar Race Begins&quot; issue in January predicted the nominees, the &quot;Nominees&quot; issue in February profiled the recently announced Oscar contenders, the &quot;Oscar Odds&quot; issue predicted the winners the week before the awards, and the &quot;After-Awards&quot; issue covered the ceremony the week after it airs. Virtually every issue mentioned the Oscars in some capacity, often on the cover, and a film or actor&#x27;s Academy Award chances were often noted in the magazine&#x27;s reviews. In comparison, music&#x27;s Grammy Awards, television&#x27;s Emmy Awards, and theater&#x27;s Tony Awards are given relatively limited coverage.
* The &quot;Must List&quot;: A double-sized issue, it was usually timed for release in the last week of June. It focuses on what the magazine considers &quot;musts&quot; in entertainment with the latest hot movies, TV shows, music projects and novels along with previews of upcoming projects in those media that are gaining interest.
* The Fall TV Preview issue: Generally released in early September, this issue has the magazine detailing the upcoming fall season of both new and returning series.
* End-of-the-Year issue: The last issue of each year, whose cover shows the &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; chosen by readers at &quot;EW&quot;&#x27;s official website. The issue features the ten-best releases in theater, film, television, music, DVD, literature and (as of last year) fashion that year. Music, television and film have two critics give their top ten; the others only have one. Each section also has a five-worst list (film is the only section in which both critics give the worst). Also in the issue are special sections devoted to the Entertainer of the Year, great performances, newly arrived stars, a timeline of infamous celebrity mishaps, and obituaries of stars who died (this used to be in a separate issue; it was combined with the &quot;end-of-the-year&quot; issue in 2003). This is the only issue without any reviews.

==Thousandth issue and redesign==

The 1,000th issue was released on July 4, 2008, and included the magazine&#x27;s top-100 list for movies, television shows, music videos, songs, Broadway shows, and technology of the past 25 years (1983–2008).

As of its 1,001st issue, &quot;EW&quot; drastically revamped the look, feel, and content of the publication—increasing font and picture sizes and making all columns&#x27; word count shorter.

==Website==
The magazine&#x27;s website EW.com provides users with daily content, breaking news, blogs, TV recaps, original video programming, and entertainment exclusives and serves as an archive for past magazine interviews, columns, and photos. Along with a website, &quot;EW&quot; also has a radio station on Sirius XM.

In April 2011, EW.com was ranked as the seventh-most-popular entertainment news property in the United States by comScore Media Metrix.

Previously named the EWwy Awards, the Poppy Awards were created by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; to honor worthy series and actors not nominated for the Primetime Emmy Awards. The Poppys are awarded in 10 categories and no person nominated for an equivalent Primetime Emmy is eligible. Votes and nominations are cast online by anyone who chooses to participate. The categories are: Best Drama Series, Best Comedy Series, Best Actor in a Drama Series, Best Actor in a Comedy Series, Best Actress in a Drama Series, Best Actress in a Comedy Series, Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

==Notable former contributors==

*Ty Burr
*Ken Tucker
*Gillian Flynn
*David Hajdu
*Owen Gleiberman
*Lisa Schwarzbaum
*Jeff Jensen
*Stephen King
*Diablo Cody
*Paul Rudnick (as Libby Waxman-Gelner)

<doc id="541248" wikidata="Q1074498" url="?curid=541248" title="Hōya, Tokyo">
<text>was a city located in the western portion of Tokyo Metropolis, Japan.

At the time of its merger, the city had an estimated population of 102,720 and a density of 11,350 persons per km2. The total area was 9.05 km2.

The area of modern Hōya was an agricultural region and agricultural products transshipment center for Edo in the premodern period, and was part of ancient Musashi Province. After the Meiji Restoration it came under the jurisdiction of the short-lived prefectures of Shinagawa (1868), Irima (1871), Kumagaya (1873) and Saitama (1876).

On April 1, 1889, the villages of Kamihōya, Shimohōya, and Hōya-shinden merged to form the village of Hoya within Niikura District, then a portion of Saitama Prefecture. The district merged with Kitaadachi District in 1896, but subsequently was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1907. Hōya was connected to central Tokyo by train from 1915. Hoya was elevated to town status in 1940, and to city status in 1967.

On January 21, 2001, Hōya was merged with the neighboring city of Tanashi to create the city of Nishi-Tōkyō, and Hōya thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

<text>Hoya is a genus of over 500 species of plants in the dogbane family, Apocynaceae, commonly known as waxflowers. Plants in the genus &quot;Hoya&quot; are mostly epiphytic or lithophytic vines, rarely subshrubs, with leathery, fleshy or succulent leaves, shortly tube-shaped or bell-shaped flowers with five horizontally spreading lobes, the flowers in umbels or racemes, and spindle-shaped or cylindrical to oval follicles containing flattened egg-shaped to oblong seeds.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Hoya&quot; are mostly epiphytic or lithophytic vines that rarely form roots in the ground, or rarely more or less shrubby. They have creeping or climbing, pendent, left-twining stems, with white latex, and sometimes with adventitious roots. The stems are cylindrical in cross section, and more or less sparsely branched. The leaves are leathery, often fleshy or succulent, elliptic, egg-shaped, rhomboid or lance-shaped, may be or hairy, and usually have a petiole. 

The flowers are often fleshy or waxy, arranged in umbels or racemes on a peduncle between the leaves, the peduncle usually persisting from year to year. The petals are wheel-shaped or tube-shaped, with five fleshy, more or less jug-shaped, horizontally spreading lobes attached to the staminal column, and forming a prominent ring alternating with the petal lobes.

The fruit is a spindle-shaped to oval follicle containing flattened, egg-shaped to oblong seeds with a tuft of hairs at one end.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was first formally described in 1810 by botanist Robert Brown in his book &quot;Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen&quot;, and honours Thomas Hoy, the gardener for the Duke of Northumberland. The first species of &quot;Hoya&quot; that Brown described (the type species), was &quot;Hoya carnosa&quot;.

===Species list===
==Use in horticulture==
Many species of Hoya are popular houseplants in temperate areas (especially &quot;H. carnosa&quot;), grown for their attractive foliage and strongly scented flowers. Numerous cultivars have been selected for different leaf forms or flower colours. Hoyas grow well indoors, preferring bright light, but will tolerate fairly low light levels, although they may not flower without bright light. Hoyas commonly sold in nurseries as houseplants include cultivars of &quot;H. carnosa&quot; (Krimson Queen, Hindu Rope − compacta), &quot;H. pubicalyx&quot; (often mislabelled as &quot;H. carnosa&quot; or &quot;H. purpurea-fusca&quot;), and &quot;H. kerrii&quot;. Hoyas are easy to propagate, and are commonly sold as cuttings, either rooted or unrooted, or as a potted plant.

&quot;Hoya carnosa&quot; has been shown in recent studies at the University of Georgia to be an excellent remover of pollutants in the indoor environment.

Various cultures have used hoyas medicinally, especially Polynesian cultures. Some are toxic to livestock and sheep poisonings in Australia are reported.

Several &quot;Hoya&quot; species and cultivars are excellent terrarium plants.

Rachel Colette Conroy was appointed the International Cultivar Registration Authority for &quot;Hoya&quot; in 2023.

<doc id="541255" wikidata="Q2982377" url="?curid=541255" title="Tiger-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Tiger&quot; class were a class of three British warships of the 20th century and the last all-gun cruisers of the Royal Navy. Construction of three cruisers (under the names &quot;Blake&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Bellerophon&quot;) began during World War II but, due to post-war austerity, the Korean War and focus on the Royal Air Force over the surface fleet, the hulls remained unfinished. Against a background of changing priorities and financial constraints, approval to complete them to a modified design was given in November 1954 and the three ships – , and – entered service from March 1959.

In January 1964, due to postponement of the Escort Cruiser programme, the cruisers were approved for conversion into helicopter-carrying cruisers. At first they were intended to carry four Westland Wessex helicopters for amphibious operations and anti-submarine protection operating &quot;East of Suez&quot; then four Westland Sea Kings for anti-submarine work. The conversion of &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot;, carried out between 1965 and 1972, was more expensive and time-consuming than expected and, with the UK Treasury opposing each cruiser&#x27;s conversion, the conversion of &quot;Lion&quot; was cancelled and she was scrapped in 1975, having been used for spares for her sister ships.

Described in one book as &quot;hideous and useless hybrids&quot; after conversion and with limited manpower, resources, and better ships available, &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot; were decommissioned in the late 1970s and placed in reserve. &quot;Blake&quot; was scrapped in 1982 and &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1986.

==Design and commissioning==

The three light cruisers that become the &quot;Tiger&quot; class came out of an order for eight 64-foot broad beam Modified and Improved &quot;Fiji&quot;-class cruisers as an immediate response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasions of Siam and of British Malaya in December 1941. The order was part of the Royal Navy 1941 supplementary shipbuilding programme and 1942 estimates in April 1942 They were slightly improved models of the &quot;Ceylon&quot; (or &quot;Uganda&quot;) sub-group of the &quot;Fiji&quot;-class ordered in late 1939 and the 63-foot beam &quot;Minotaur&quot; group ordered in the 1941 Royal Navy programme. HMS &quot;Defence&quot;, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Hawke&quot; were begun as &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class cruisers in 1941–43 with three triple 6-inch gun turrets in 1944. Production of the 1942 Design Light Fleet Carriers was given priority from August 1942 by the Future Building Committee and in August 1942, four unnamed &quot;Minotaur&quot; cruisers were cancelled and their machinery, builders and building slips reallocated to light fleet carriers. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; (which became&quot; Tiger&quot; in 1945) had been ordered in May 1941 and the keel laid down at (Browns Clydebank yard) with &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Minotaur&quot; in October 1941. &quot;Blake&quot;″s keel was started at Fairfields in August 1942. While the building schedules of &quot;Minotaur&quot;, &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Defence&quot; were unaffected; construction of &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; slowed; &quot;Hawke&quot; was not laid down until July 1943 and the eighth was never started. The priority of the light fleet carriers, anti-submarine escorts, the battleship &quot;Vanguard&quot; at Browns, and the large fleet carrier HMS &quot;Africa&quot; (a &quot;Malta&quot;-class carrier), ordered from Fairfield effectively suspended work on &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot; from March 1944 to July 1945. Work on &quot;Defence&quot; was delayed by industrial relations, strikes, conditions, sub-standard facilities and low quality steel at Scotts, Greenock. The problems at Scotts and concern over the delay to &quot;Defence&quot; and the &quot;Tiger&quot;-class led the Director of Naval Construction to visit Scotts&#x27; yard in August 1943 with work stopped by striking riveters, carpenters and shipwrights It was planned to launch &quot;Defence&quot; in April 1944 to complete in July 1945, for &quot;Hawke&quot; to launch in 1944 and commission mid-1945, with &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; commissioning mid-1946. However only &quot;Minotaur&quot;, &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and were completed by late 1945. &quot; Defence&quot;, well advanced in construction, was placed in reserve without armament fitted and spent eight years moored offshore in Gareloch.

===Design changes===
In March 1943 it was decided to upgrade the main armament from the Mk XXIII (re-designated post war in Arabic numerals as &quot;Mark 23&quot;) triple 6-inch turret to the dual purpose (DP) electrically-powered Mk XXIV (Mark 24) triple 6-inch on five cruisers ordered or under construction: &quot;Blake&quot;, &quot;Hawke&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. The guns in the new Mk 24 turret could reach a maximum of 60 degrees of elevation giving some anti-aircraft capability. The three more complete &quot;Minotaur&quot; cruisers, HMS &quot;Minotaur&quot;, &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Superb&quot; would complete with the Mk 23 turret. In January 1943 it was decided to increase the beam of &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to .

By late 1943 the effective defeat of German surface forces and the large American cruiser construction programme made the cruiser requirement less urgent. The planned delivery of fleet carriers, the light fleet carriers, escort carriers and the new Battle-class destroyers in 1944-45 made limiting the manpower requirements and future building programme an absolute priority for Churchill by October–December 1943 The RN had more cruisers and refitted cruisers than it had crew for and as a result two new classes of 5.25-inch gun cruisers - five 7,000 ton with three twin 5.25-inch turrets and the N2 class - were cancelled by February 1944. &quot;Tiger&quot;-class construction was slowed and periodically suspended and new class of large &quot;Neptune&quot;-class cruisers (to be armed with the same Mk 24 turrets as the Tigers and have a second battery of QF 4.5-inch Mk V guns ordered for the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers) were delayed. Two new cruisers were passed to the RCN as Canada was seen as the UK&#x27;s vital wartime ally; HMS &quot;Minotaur&quot; and the cruiser were gifted to Canada in April 1944 and &quot;Minotaur&quot; was handed over on schedule to the RCN in June 1945.

A proposal was made in 1944 and again in February 1945 for two new cruisers and two light aircraft carriers to be delivered to the Royal Australian Navy; the UK offering HMS &quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot;. The offer was delayed because Australia also had a manpower problem; by mid-1945 the manpower issue had not resolved and the Allies had overwhelming naval superiority and the idea was dropped. The RAN determined the service life of its two County-class heavy cruisers could be extended to 1950-54.

In 1944–45, the RN, CNS and government thought the merging of the cruiser and destroyer categories was too early, expensive and radical. With the planned cancelled, the suspended ships were the only cruiser hulls available and worth considering for rearmament. By 1946, nine Mk 24 turrets were 75–80% complete with three further turrets partially complete for use with the &quot;Tiger&quot; cruisers. These turrets were a more advanced version of the wartime Mk 23 triple . The new Mk 24 6-inch mounts were interim electric turrets with remote power-control and power-worked breech. The &quot;Tiger&quot; design, like &quot;Superb,&quot; had a broader beam - a foot wider at beam - than &quot;Swiftsure&quot; on which to accommodate the larger turrets though it was preferred to complete &quot;Superb&quot; with the older Mk 23 turrets in 1945.

It was decided to mothball the three incomplete &quot;Tiger&quot;s in November 1947 as the aircraft carriers &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot; had priority. The &quot;Tiger&quot;s were maintained as in some ways they were newer hulls with better internal and underwater protection, subdivision and compartments taking advantage of the removal of the hangar and X turret, Action Information centre, more light AA, pumps and electric generating capacity.

Another two &quot;Tiger&quot;-class cruisers were cancelled. &quot;Hawke&quot; was laid down in July 1943, and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; possibly had a keel laid down. Work on all the cruisers other than &quot;Superb&quot; stopped after mid-1944. .&quot;Hawke&quot; was suspended in January 1945, and broken up in 1947 in the Portsmouth dockyard although her boilers and machinery were complete, and her new 6-inch guns close to completion.

===Delay and redesign===
The second Churchill government, elected in 1951, favoured the RAF and reduced the naval budget. With the RN priority being anti-submarine frigates, the restart of work on the &quot;Tiger&quot; cruisers (and reconstructions of other cruisers) was delayed by three years to 1954. The original decision to delay the &quot;Tiger&quot;s in the late 1940s had been to reassess cruiser design and the provision of effective anti-aircraft (AA) fire-control to engage jet aircraft which was beyond UK industrial capability at the time. Consequently, higher priority was given to the battleship , the Battle-class destroyers and the two new aircraft carriers ( and ) for allocation of 26 US-supplied medium-range anti-aircraft gun directors (which had been delivered under Lend-Lease in 1944/5) The US version of the Type 275 High Altitude/Low Altitude DCT were stabilised and could track multiple air targets of Mach 1.5+. These US directors were superior to the British built Type 275 which was the only medium-range AA fire control until 1955 and could barely distinguish transonic targets at Mach 0.8. The 1947–49 period saw a peace dividend, and frigate construction became the priority in the Korean War.

By 1949 two alternative fits for the &quot;Tiger&quot;s had been drawn up, one as anti-aircraft cruisers with six twin 3-inch 70 calibre and one with two twin QF 6-inch Mark N5 guns (Mark 26 automatic mountings) and three twin 3-inch/70s. Both were designed primarily for high-level anti-aircraft defence and largely intended as a replacement for the 5.25-inch and 4.5-inch turrets on battleships and old fleet carriers. The rapid-fire automatic twin 3-inch and 6-inch were designed on a post-war philosophy that the first 20 seconds of anti-jet aircraft and anti-missile engagement were critical and that the twin 3-inch firing at 240 rounds per minute would successfully engage six air targets in 20-second bursts. Sustained fire capability for naval gunfire support of ground forces (NGS) was not a design requirement. The automatic twin 6-inch guns for the secondary role of defence of and attack on trade also had some very high level (up to 8-mile altitude) anti-aircraft capability. In historical terms it represented a light armament and similar US weapons introduced on had experienced considerable problems with jamming and had performed below expectation. A third lower-cost option of fitting two Mk  XXIV turrets in &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; positions, two semi-automatic Mk 6 twin 4.5-inch in &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; positions and a twin (Mark VI) or single (Mark V) 4.5-inch on each flank was considered at the start of the Korean War. This could not have been completed before 1953 as an immediate surface fighting response to a Soviet &quot;Sverdlov-&quot;class cruiser and would have required a crew of 900+. Further the RN 4.5-inch DP gun was not a good postwar AA weapon., the six Mk 24 DC-powered turrets were unfinished and complex (with two pairs of Type 274 and Type 275 directors) DC wiring had been removed from the &quot;Tiger&quot; class in 1948 and so the Mk 24 was not suitable for fast completion of the class. There was a strong desire that the new cruisers should have AC power, not DC or dual systems.

There was great doubt of the merits of completing the &quot;Tiger&quot;s, given that Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot; turboprop and Tupolev Tu-16 &quot;Badger&quot; jet bombers flew faster and higher than anticipated which added to the argument for missile equipped-ships for anti-aircraft defence. The with 6.9-inch thick armour, speed and range also outclassed the &quot;Tiger&quot;s. Even six-inch bombardment was increasingly unacceptable to the Royal Navy after Korea and was allowed only on the first day of Operation Musketeer after strong political opposition. The RN staff were completely divided over the development of new AA guns larger than 4-inch post war. Charles Lillicrap, the Director of Naval Construction in 1946, saw the new automatic 3-inch/70 as eliminating the need for the new Mk 26 DP 6-inch guns, as the guns fulfilled the AA requirement. That and the fact the new twin 3-inch/70 and twin Mk 26 6-inch were six years from being tested led to both &quot;Tiger&quot;s and &quot;Minotaur&quot;s being suspended in 1947 and slowed work on the new 6-inch (and proposed new 5-inch) guns. The proven Mk 23 seemed more than adequate and its efficiency was improved in the 1950s.

===Revised design===
In 1954 construction of the three ships was approved to the 1948 design mounting new automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns. This was a controversial decision, made to avoid ordering larger cruisers or new aircraft carriers of questionable utility at immense cost. Against the apparent Soviet threat of cruisers acting as raiders against merchant vessels, the &quot;Tiger&quot;s lacked the range and armament to challenge the Soviet ships, on paper, while other RN officers thought a couple of &quot;Daring&quot;s or Type 41 frigate anti-aircraft frigates were all that was needed to challenge the inexperienced Russian crews. Cruisers were better deterred and sunk by aircraft carriers operating Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom strike aircraft.

The November 1954 cabinet meeting deciding the fate of the Royal Navy took six hours. Churchill was determined to limit the defence budget with a view to developing nuclear weapons and less vulnerable RAF aircraft.
The completion of the &quot;Tiger&quot;s was approved in July 1954 with them now seen as &quot;escort and anti-aircraft support for convoys and carrier task groups&quot;, the Royal Navy estimating completion in three years for £6 million each compared with five years and £12m for a new cruiser design. The new automatic twin 6-inch and twin 3-inch dual-purpose guns were approved for production. The modernised &quot;Tiger&quot;s were an interim measure with the expectation that guided missile equipped ships were &quot;at least ten years away&quot;. The 1957 Defence White Paper under Duncan Sandys proposed to reduce the number of large ships in the RN fleet; the &quot;Tiger&quot;s, &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Superb&quot; would enter service as interim anti-aircraft ships, until the s were commissioned and the two Second World War cruisers, and were mothballed.

==Initial service==
The reconstruction involved the stripping out of the superstructure and most of the services. Equipment was replaced or modified to operate on AC electrical power.
&quot;Tiger&quot; was completed in Jan 1959, &quot;Lion&quot; (formerly &quot;Defence&quot;) in 1960 and &quot;Blake&quot; in March 1961. Actual costs were £13 to 15 million per ship, partly due to inflation.

While outwardly identical, the three &quot;Tiger&quot;s were each very different in their electrics. &quot;Blake&quot; was essentially an experimental ship with all-electric turrets able to engage Mach 2.5 air targets but was put in reserve in 1963 for lack of technical staff. had deteriorated after eight years in Gareloch before reconstruction and had to be withdrawn from operations &quot;East of Suez&quot; in 1963 due to boiler, mechanical and armament problems. While the electric 3-inch/70 AA systems were excellent they required intensive maintenance and excessive manpower and fitters, the twin Mk 26 6-inch automatic guns were a &#x27;disaster&#x27; constantly jamming and rarely fulfilling their basic 30 second burst fire min capability HMNZS , with some Royal Navy crew, was reactivated as a surface escort for carrier groups in Southeast Asia in 1964 to deter the threat of the &quot;Sverdlov&quot; cruiser bought by Indonesia and in 1965 to support the amphibious carriers with air defence and general fleet support. By 1966 &quot;Royalist&quot;, like &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Lion&quot;, was unsustainable in the last year of the Indonesia-Malaya confrontation. The large s were refitted (from 1961) with MRS3 fire-control to provide a substitute for the &quot;Tiger&quot;s; their three turrets giving them an advantage over the &quot;Tiger&quot;.

In early December 1966, &quot;Tiger&quot; hosted an abortive series of meetings between the prime minister, Harold Wilson and Ian Smith, prime minister of Rhodesia after the latter&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence. The two men boarded the ship while she was anchored in Algeciras Bay. &quot;Tiger&quot; then sailed eastwards into the Mediterranean, returning at the end of the week to Gibraltar where both men disembarked to return to their respective countries.

==Conversions==
By 1964 the Conservative Government and half the naval staff saw the &quot;Tiger&quot;s as no longer affordable or credible in the surface combat or fleet air defence role and would have preferred to decommission them but given they were technically only three years old and built at immense expense, scrapping them was politically difficult.

There were financial pressures in the RN due to the cost of the planned CVA-01 aircraft carriers and the Escort Cruiser programme (four helicopter carrier vessels each armed with Sea Dart anti-aircraft and Ikara anti-submarine weapons operating four &quot;Chinook type&quot; helicopters and having emergency accommodation for 700 troops). Cancellation of the last four of the ten planned &quot;County&quot;-class guided missile destroyers and moving two or three of the &quot;Tiger&quot;s to operational reserve would offset the Escort cruiser cost and replacing the &quot;Tiger&quot;s or fully funded the more &#x27;conventional cruisers, intended as replacement ships in 1960 (a) modified versions of the County-class built to the same hull dimensions and armament without Seaslug, to carry 4-6 Wessex helicopters or (b) the variant models of the Counties proposed by the RAN or (3) An enlarged version of the County design built to cruiser standards with additional workshops, parts and stores carried and some armour protection with provision for three Wessex and the American Tartar system. However, the decision to build Britain&#x27;s nuclear missile submarines meant the Escort cruisers proposal was postponed, with budget pressure and the fact both the available Vickers design teams and the navy&#x27;s own available naval architects were now employed on the nuclear submarines. Though the escort cruisers were deferred, the requirement remained and conversion of the &quot;Tiger&quot;s was identified as the quickest solution in 1963. Conversion into helicopter carriers carrying Westland Wessex helicopters for Royal Marine Commando or anti-submarine work East of Suez was approved on 24 January 1964. 

A large hangar replaced the &#x27;Y&#x27; turret, the forward turrets were retained for shore bombardment and anti-surface vessel work. Intended to provide extra powerful vessels to support and conduct amphibious operations east of Suez where it was difficult logistically for the Royal Navy to sustain even one operational carrier and one commando carrier in 1963–64. The original plan retained the three twin 3-inch mounts with an updated sonar and radar including Type 965 and replacing the Type 992 target indicator radar with the Type 993. British Army preference in 1964 with the Indonesian confrontation building was to retain the &quot;Tiger&quot;s with their 6-inch guns for shore bombardment.

Three configurations (schemes X, Y, and Z) were considered in 1965 for the conversion to helicopter carriers. X had deck space for one helicopter and a hangar for three at the cost of the rear 6-inch turret and no maintenance space, Y gave deck space for two Wessex helicopters (only one landing or taking off at a time) and hangar for four at the cost of removing the 6-inch and 3-inch armament aft, Z was same deck space and hangar capacity as Y but two helicopters could take off (or land) at once with 6-inch and 3-inch mounts removed. Z was chosen as the best option even for a projected six-year lifespan and expected to take 15 months and cost £2 million per ship. The work would take place at the same time as refit - predicted as 15 months. The final cost was £12 million for all three (conversion and refit) and £10.5 million for the helicopters. It was recognised that 75 pilots would also be needed at a time when the FAA was already 37 pilots short.

To avoid the political problem of scrapping new cruisers as well as the aircraft carriers, the Labour Government elected in October 1964 decided to retain large ships for command and flagship roles and accepted the RN and MoD argument that three &quot;Tiger&quot; cruisers would replace the anti-submarine warfare role previously provided by aircraft carriers. At the time the Royal Navy was mostly concentrated on east of Suez operations and the anti-submarine deterrent role was to counter slow Indonesian and Chinese diesel-powered submarines. In theory, even one &quot;Tiger&quot; could threaten the use of nuclear depth charges and free up space on aircraft carriers for strike and air combat aircraft.

The government continued the conversion of &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot; after deciding on further ship cuts and a faster phase-out of carriers in 1968. During the conversion of &quot;Blake&quot;, the plan was changed to allow the cruisers to operate four more capable Westland Sea King helicopters, although only three Sea Kings could actually ever be accommodated and serviced in the new longer hangar, which forced the replacement of the side 3-inch gun mounts with less effective Seacat guided weapon system. The low priority given to deterrence of Soviet submarines in the Northern Atlantic by the MoD is reflected in the decision to convert a suitable anti-submarine helicopter platform, the carrier &quot;Hermes&quot; into an amphibious carrier (&quot;commando carrier&quot;). The later advent of the s would seem to add weight to this proposal. &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot; were larger, and offered more hangar capacity. The government&#x27;s priority was to arm aircraft in West Germany with tactical and thermonuclear weapons. Provision of nuclear depth charges for anti-submarine, aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates was limited, although approval for , and ships for triggering Nuclear depth bombs was given in 1969 and these ships offered quieter listening platforms than the &quot;Tiger&quot;s.

The proposed class of four large Type 82 destroyers (planned to accompany the CVA-01 aircraft carriers) fitted with nuclear Ikara anti-submarine missiles could have been a more reliable nuclear deterrent, but the Ikara was ultimately fitted only to carry conventional Mark 46 torpedoes and due to the 1966 Defence White Paper only one Type 82 air defence destroyer, , was built as a testbed for the weapon technologies. &quot;Bristol&quot; lacked a helicopter hangar, and was plagued by problems common with dated and complex steam propulsion.
With no other options, work began to convert &quot;Blake&quot; to a helicopter cruiser in 1965 and &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1968. The structural modernisation work on the hulls was difficult and expensive. However, the ships successfully served as helicopter command cruisers and provided an argument to justify the construction of their replacement, the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class &quot;through deck cruisers&quot;. &quot;Lion&quot;″s conversion was cancelled due to delays and other workload in the dockyards.
By 1969, it was obvious that &quot;Blake&quot;″s conversion was unsatisfactory. &quot;Lion&quot; remained operational until late 1965, when she was placed in reserve and used as a parts source for the conversion of &quot;Tiger&quot; and she was sold for breaking up in 1975. The conversions left &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Blake&quot; some 380 tons heavier with a full displacement of 12,080 tons and their crew complements increased by 169 to 885. Originally. &quot;Blake&quot;″s conversion had been more expensive than envisaged (£5.5 million) and &quot;Tiger&quot;″s £13.25 million, due to the level of inflation at the time.

==Obsolescence and decommissioning==

&quot;Blake&quot; returned to service in 1969 and &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1972. &quot;Lion&quot; was used for spares for both of them before she was sold off and scrapped in 1975 by Thos. W. Ward at Inverkeithing. Cutbacks in Royal Navy funding and manpower, under the new Conservative government and the belief in the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and submarines for anti-submarine operations, reduced the need for the class. The recommissioning of the carrier and conversion of into a helicopter carrier, then into an anti-submarine carrier meant that they could carry twice as many Sea Kings as the &quot;Tiger&quot;s further decreased their importance. In April 1978, &quot;Tiger&quot; was withdrawn from service, followed by &quot;Blake&quot; in 1979; both ships were laid up in reserve at Chatham Dockyard. When &quot;Blake&quot; was decommissioned in 1979, she was the last cruiser to serve in the Royal Navy and her passing was marked on 6 December 1979 when she fired her main guns for the last time in the English Channel.

During the Falklands War, &quot;Blake&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; were surveyed to determine their condition for reactivation. The survey determined both ships to be in good condition and they were put into dry-dock, &quot;Blake&quot; at Chatham, &quot;Tiger&quot; at Portsmouth. By mid-May, it was determined that the ships would not be completed in time to take part in the war and work ceased.

Chile showed interest in acquiring both ships, the sale did not proceed and the ships sat at anchor. &quot;Blake&quot; was sold for breaking up at the end of August 1982 and &quot;Tiger&quot; arrived at the breakers in Spain in September 1986.

<text>Current 93 are an English experimental music group, founded in 1982 by David Tibet. Much of Current 93&#x27;s early work was similar to late 1970s and early 1980s industrial music: abrasive tape loops, droning synthesizer noises and Tibet&#x27;s distorted, excoriating vocals. In the mid-&#x27;80s, Current 93&#x27;s sound shifted to a style Tibet has called &quot;apocalyptic folk&quot;, combining folk music with industrial elements. Tibet has been the only constant member of Current 93, with a wide variety of collaborators joining in over the years. They have released over twenty full-length albums, as well as many other recordings.

==Background==
Current 93 initially consisted of Tibet, fellow Psychic TV alumnus Jhonn Balance, and 23 Skidoo member Fritz Catlin. Tibet has been the only constant member in the group, though Steven Stapleton (of Nurse with Wound) appeared on nearly every Current 93 release until 2010. Michael Cashmore was also a long-term contributor starting with &quot;Thunder Perfect Mind&quot;. Douglas P. of Death in June has played on well over a dozen Current 93 releases.

Tibet&#x27;s lyrics have been fairly consistent, regardless of delivery: The earlier recordings reflect his preoccupation with death, Christ, mysticism, Aleister Crowley (Tibet borrowed the term &quot;93 Current&quot; from Crowley – the 93 Current being the current of Thelema or Agape), Tibetan Buddhism, Gnosticism, runes, swastikas, Noddy, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, and a variety of occult notions. The later to present-day period of Current 93&#x27;s recordings increasingly reflect Tibet&#x27;s interest in Christian mysticism and apocalypse. Tibet has stated that he identifies as a Christian.

Literary influences include Lautreamont&#x27;s &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;, the Bible and its apocrypha, &quot;The Poetic Eddas&quot;, the Child Ballads, Hildegard von Bingen, Yukio Mishima, John Dee&#x27;s &quot;De Heptarchia Mystica&quot;, The Thunder, Perfect Mind, William Blake, Louis Wain, writer Thomas Ligotti, occult British author Arthur Machen (originator of the title &quot;The Inmost Light&quot;), M.R. James&#x27;s various ghost stories, &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot;, Count Eric Stenbock, and Russell Hoban&#x27;s &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;.

<text>Sotheby&#x27;s ( ) is a British-founded multinational corporation with headquarters in New York City. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest brokers of fine and decorative art, jewellery, and collectibles. It has 80 locations in 40 countries, and maintains a significant presence in the UK.

Sotheby&#x27;s was established on 11 March 1744 in London by Samuel Baker, a bookseller. In 1767 the firm became Baker &amp; Leigh, after George Leigh became a partner, and was renamed to Leigh and Sotheby in 1778 after Baker&#x27;s death when Leigh&#x27;s nephew, John Sotheby, inherited Leigh&#x27;s share. Other former names include: Leigh, Sotheby and Wilkinson; Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge (1864–1924); Sotheby and Company (1924–83); Mssrs Sotheby; Sotheby &amp; Wilkinson; Sotheby Mak van Waay; and Sotheby&#x27;s &amp; Co.

The American holding company was initially incorporated in August 1983 in Michigan as Sotheby&#x27;s Holdings, Inc. In June 2006, it was reincorporated in the State of Delaware and was renamed Sotheby&#x27;s. In June 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s was acquired by French-Israeli businessman Patrick Drahi at a 61% market premium.

Sotheby&#x27;s Institute of Art (an educational facility), Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty (real estate dealers), and RM Sotheby&#x27;s (classic car dealers) are subsidiaries or partner organisations.

==History==

===Beginnings (18th &amp; 19th century)===

Sotheby&#x27;s was established on 11 March 1744 in London by Samuel Baker, a bookseller. In 1767 the firm became Baker &amp; Leigh, after Samuel Baker auctioned several hundred valuable books from the library of The Rt Hon Sir John Stanley, 1st Baronet, of Grangegorman and became business partners with George Leigh. The library Napoleon took with him into exile at St Helena, as well as the library collections of John Wilkes, Benjamin Heywood Bright and the Dukes of Devonshire and of Buckingham (both related to George Leigh), were sold through Samuel Baker&#x27;s auctions.

After Baker&#x27;s death in 1778, the business was left to Leigh and his nephew John Sotheby, where it became a prominent book auction house and was renamed Leigh and Sotheby.

George Leigh died in 1816, but not before recruiting Samuel E Leigh into the business. Under the Sotheby family, the auction house extended its activities to auctioning prints, medals, and coins. John Wilkinson, Sotheby&#x27;s senior accountant, became a partner and eventually the company&#x27;s new head of the company when the last member of the Sotheby family died in 1861.

===20th century===

The business did not seek to auction fine arts initially. Their first major success in this field was the sale of a Frans Hals painting for nine thousand guineas in 1913.
Other former names include: Leigh, Sotheby and Wilkinson; Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge (1864–1924); Sotheby and Company (1924–83); Mssrs Sotheby; Sotheby &amp; Wilkinson; Sotheby Mak van Waay; and Sotheby&#x27;s &amp; Co. In 1917, Sotheby&#x27;s relocated from 13 Wellington Street to 34–35 New Bond Street, which remains as its London base. They soon came to rival Christie&#x27;s as leaders of the London auction market, which capitalised on the arts. 

In 1964, Sotheby&#x27;s purchased Parke-Bernet, the largest auctioneer of fine art in the United States at the time. In the following year, Sotheby&#x27;s moved to 980 Madison Avenue, New York. With the international fine art auction industry growing, Sotheby&#x27;s opened offices in Paris and Los Angeles in 1967, and became the first auction house to operate in Hong Kong in 1973, and Moscow in 1988.

As well as numerous high-profile real-life auctions being held at Sotheby&#x27;s, the firm&#x27;s auctioneers have also been used in various films, including the 1983 James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;.

In 1988 they introduced a Decorative Arts Award which showed in exhibitions in London and Tokyo. It is fair to say that not all commentators welcomed the move dismissing some exhibits as &quot;Crafts&quot; however several notable people were amongst the participants. Michael Rowe was the winner of the Decorative Arts Award in1988 and a detail of the Tapestry &quot;Soft Flight&quot; by Mary Farmer graced the catalogue cover.

With private transactions constituting an essential and increasingly profitable business segment, through the years Sotheby&#x27;s has bought art galleries and helped dealers finance purchases. It has also gone into partnership with dealers on private sales. In 1990, Sotheby&#x27;s teamed up with dealer William Acquavella, to form Acquavella Modern Art, a Nevada general partnership and a subsidiary of Sotheby&#x27;s Holding Company. The subsidiary paid $143 million for the contents of the Pierre Matisse Gallery in Manhattan, which included about 2,300 works by artists including Miró, Jean Dubuffet, Alberto Giacometti, and Marc Chagall, and began selling the works both at auction and privately. 

In 1996, Sotheby&#x27;s acquired Andre Emmerich Gallery to operate a division called Emmerich/Sotheby&#x27;s, As a consequence, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the artists&#x27; estates, as well as the estates of Morris Louis and Milton Avery announced that they would not renew their Emmerich contracts. That decision came right after it was disclosed that Sotheby&#x27;s had decided to close Emmerich&#x27;s prime space at 41 East 57th Street, and that its artists would be handled out of Deitch Projects. Sotheby&#x27;s subsequently closed Andre Emmerich in 1998.

In 1997, Sotheby&#x27;s purchased a 50% interest in Deitch Projects but later sold its share back to Jeffrey Deitch. In 1997, it also bought Leslie Hindman Auctioneers in Chicago; by 2001, it stopped holding auctions in the city.

In 2006, Sotheby&#x27;s acquired a Dutch dealership, Noortman Master Paintings, from its owner, Robert Noortman, for $82.5 million ($56.5 million worth of Sotheby&#x27;s stock and assumption of more than $26 million in gallery debt, including $11.7 million owed to the auction house). Sotheby&#x27;s and Noortman had collaborated before in 1995, when the sales of Dutch plastic millionaire Joost Ritman were divided between the two companies. Already in 1990, Sotheby&#x27;s New York had successfully lobbied for a zoning change permitting the construction of a 27-story residential tower above the five-story headquarters; this expansion was never realised. Instead, Sotheby&#x27;s throughout the 1990s expressed interest in sites that ranged from the old Alexander&#x27;s building on East 59th Street to the New York Coliseum site on Columbus Circle, and was even considering moving into the old B. Altman Building on Fifth Avenue.

===21st century===

The company eventually bought its York Avenue building for $11 million in 2000 and completed a $140 million expansion and renovation in 2001, adding six floors and 240,000 square feet. The renovation added the capability to store works on the same premises as the specialist departments, galleries, and auction spaces. Sotheby&#x27;s New York&#x27;s offices also house Sotheby&#x27;s Wine and the former Bid (an American contemporary restaurant and later bistro), which was closed due to poor attendance. The company sold the building in 2002 for $175 million. In May 2007, Sotheby&#x27;s opened an office in Moscow in response to rapidly growing interest among Russian buyers in the international art market and held sales in Qatar in 2009.

As many industries took a blow from the economic crisis of 2008, the art market also saw a contraction. In international figures, art prices fell by 7.5% in Q1 of 2008 in comparison to the previous quarter. In September and October 2008, major auction houses saw a sharp decline in sales: artprice.com, the world leader in art market information, coined the term &quot;Black October&quot;. Sotheby&#x27;s bought-in rate was 27%, Christie&#x27;s was 45% and Phillips de Pury&#x27;s was 46%. However, the total values of global and United States Fine Art auction sales were US$8.3 billion and US$2.9 billion, respectively. In 2009, art collector Steven A. Cohen built a 6 percent stake in the auction house for his hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors.

In 2011, Noortman&#x27;s Amsterdam space was closed and the gallery moved to London. Two years later, Sotheby&#x27;s closed Noortmans, after having written down $8.3 million of inventory and started selling off lower-valued works of art through other auction houses. , Sotheby&#x27;s is present in over 40 countries, with 80 locations. In 2012, the company signed a 10-year joint-venture agreement to form Sotheby&#x27;s (Beijing) Auction Co. Ltd., the first international auction house in China; under the agreement, it invested $1.2 million to take an 80 percent stake in the venture with state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group.

As of 2012, the firm had an annual revenue of approximately US$831.8 million and offices on Manhattan&#x27;s York Avenue and London&#x27;s New Bond Street.

Sotheby&#x27;s shares a rivalry with Christie&#x27;s for the position of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent fine art auctioneer, a title of much subjectivity. In August 2004, Sotheby&#x27;s introduced an online system – MySotheby&#x27;s – allowing clients to track lots and create &quot;wishlists&quot; that could be automatically updated as new works became available. Sotheby&#x27;s also created the BIDnow service, which allows bidders to bid real-time online while watching the broadcast auctions, with the exception of Wine auctions. LiveBid is Sotheby&#x27;s online bidding system exclusively for wine auctions.

In the meantime, income from classic auctioneering has fallen, as Sotheby&#x27;s reported a decrease of 42% in net income in the first half of 2012.

In February 2015 Sotheby&#x27;s acquired a 25% stake in classic and vintage automobile auctioneer RM Auctions.

In March 2015, Tad Smith, former president and chief executive of New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, succeeded William F. Ruprecht as CEO of Sotheby&#x27;s. Smith had no experience in the auction industry but had overseen a doubling of profits during his time at Madison Square Garden. In 2015, the auction house&#x27;s longest-serving auctioneer, David Redden, and vice-chairman retired.

In 2016, the company spent $50 million on Art Agency Partners, run by Amy Cappellazzo, Allan Schwartzman and Adam Chinn. The price was shared among the trio, as well as $35 million performance-related bonus. The five-year contract expired in 2021.

In July 2016, Chinese insurance company Taikang Life became Sotheby&#x27;s largest shareholder, with a 13.5% stake.

On 25 January 2018, Sotheby&#x27;s acquired the AI company Thread Genius for an undisclosed amount.

In February 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s announced a redesign and expansion of its New York headquarters on the Upper East Side that is being led by the designer Shohei Shigematsu of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA). The exhibition space there will grow to over 90,000 square feet from 67,000, and the project will include the addition of several new galleries. The company also launched a new online bidding platform on its website.

In June 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s was acquired by French-Israeli businessman Patrick Drahi at a 61% market premium. In October 2019, he brought in Charles F. Stewart as Sotheby&#x27;s new CEO, and former CEO Tad Smith transitioned to an advisory role. Drahi instituted a number of cost-cutting measures, including senior executive layoffs in 2019; job cuts, salary cuts, and a move to online auctions during the 2020 pandemic; and announcing an end to Sotheby&#x27;s employee pension plan in 2022.

In 2020, Sotheby&#x27;s overtook Christie&#x27;s as the world&#x27;s top auction house for the first time since 2011, with over $5 billion in aggregate sales compared to its rival&#x27;s $4.4 billion.

As of late 2021, Drahi&#x27;s son, Nathan Drahi, was the managing director of Sotheby&#x27;s Asia.

In June 2023, Sotheby&#x27;s agreed to purchase 945 Madison Avenue, a former museum building designed by Marcel Breuer, to house the company&#x27;s headquarters, including its galleries, exhibition space, and auction room. The company plans to open its new space in 2025.

==History of public and private ownership==

Sotheby&#x27;s became a UK public company in 1977. In 1980, after a drop in sales, Sotheby&#x27;s relocated its North American headquarters from Madison Avenue to a former cigar factory at 1334 York Avenue, New York. In 1982, the auction house closed its Madison Avenue galleries at East 76th Street, and its Los Angeles galleries were sold and West Coast auctions moved to New York.

In 1983, a group of investors including American millionaire Alfred Taubman purchased and privatized Sotheby&#x27;s. Sotheby&#x27;s was initially incorporated as Sotheby&#x27;s Holdings, Inc. in Michigan in August 1983. 

In 1988, Taubman took Sotheby&#x27;s public and listed the company&#x27;s shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), making Sotheby&#x27;s the oldest publicly traded company on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &quot;BID&quot;. In June 2006, Sotheby&#x27;s Holdings, Inc. reincorporated in the State of Delaware and was renamed Sotheby&#x27;s shortly after.

In 2019 Sotheby&#x27;s was acquired by Patrick Drahi for $3.7 billion, becoming again a private company and no longer trading on the NYSE. 

In 2024 the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADIA acquired a minority stake in Sotheby&#x27;s, with a total investment of approximately $1 billion in the house.

==Auction process==

Sotheby&#x27;s auctions are usually held during the day. The majority are free and open to the public, with the exception of occasional evening auctions, which require tickets. Attendees have no obligation to bid.

Bidding finishes when only one bidder remains willing to purchase the lot at the bidder&#x27;s declared price. The auctioneer &quot;knocks down&quot; the lot, declaring it sold to the winning bidder. The winning bid for a lot is also called the hammer price. Sotheby&#x27;s organises the delivery of the lot in private with the buyer.

===Buying===
Buyers can find out what is for sale at Sotheby&#x27;s by browsing e-catalogues, visiting pre-sale exhibitions, purchasing print catalogues and registering for e-mail alerts. Buyers can register to bid in person at Sotheby&#x27;s offices, or online. Sotheby&#x27;s requires that prospective buyers provide government-issued proof of identity and sometimes a bank reference. There are four ways buyers can bid: in person at the auction rooms, by telephone, bid live online or make an absentee bid online. When a bid is successful, Sotheby&#x27;s calculates and sums the hammer price, the buyer&#x27;s premium and taxes.

===Selling===
Sellers are required to submit an Auction Estimate Form, providing thorough information and a photograph of the item. Once accepted for auction, the seller and Sotheby&#x27;s sign a contract, which sets out the reserve price and the seller&#x27;s commission. If bidding on a seller&#x27;s lot does not reach the reserve price, the item is not sold.

;Private sales
Sotheby&#x27;s links sellers with prospective buyers in private if sellers do not want a public auction. The identities of buyers and consignors are not disclosed. Sotheby&#x27;s Private Sales works with clients with confidentiality and tailors the buying and selling process in a private setting. Private Sales accounted for 16.5% of all Sotheby&#x27;s sales in 2011. That year, Sotheby&#x27;s inaugurated a new gallery space called S2 at its York Avenue headquarters with a show of work by American abstract painter Sam Francis. Unlike Haunch of Venison, a gallery that Christie&#x27;s bought in 2007, S2 is solely devoted to showcasing the auction house&#x27;s private sales. In 2013, Sotheby&#x27;s opened a gallery for private sales close to its branch in London, in a five-story block at 31 George Street. The auction house also conducts private sales through its selling exhibitions of monumental sculpture at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, and at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

;Financial services
Established in 1988, Sotheby&#x27;s Financial Services offers loans for consigned property and loans against the value of client&#x27;s items through customized terms. The auction house also makes term loans, for a defined period of time, on works that clients are not planning to sell, in part to &quot;establish or enhance mutually beneficial relationships with borrowers&quot; that can lead to future consignments. While traditional lenders such as banks provide loans at a lower cost to borrowers, Sotheby&#x27;s said in its 2011 annual report, few will accept works of art as the sole collateral.

;Picture library
Sotheby&#x27;s Picture Library contained images in a variety of formats available for licensing, and was one of the image suppliers to various databases such as the British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies (BAPLA). However, only the image archive mentioned on the Sotheby&#x27;s website is an out-of-date reference to the Cecil Beaton Studio Archive, which Cecil Beaton sold to Sotheby&#x27;s in 1977.

;Wine
In October 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s launched &quot;Sotheby&#x27;s Own Label Collection&quot;, a line of a dozen wines. The project took two years to complete, and is based on Sotheby&#x27;s best-selling wines, both those represented in-store and on its e-commerce platform. Additionally, the collection reflects some of the long-standing relationships Sotheby&#x27;s has with producers around the world. &quot;The Sotheby&#x27;s Wine Encyclopedia&quot; has been published in several editions since 1988, written by Tom Stevenson.

;Other

Sotheby&#x27;s has produced a bimonthly online magazine since November–December 2018, &quot;Sotheby&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Sotheby&#x27;s Prize==
The Sotheby&#x27;s Prize, launched in 2017, is a $250,000 annual award given to museums that exhibit what are vaguely described as &quot;groundbreaking shows&quot;. The inaugural winners were &quot;Many Tongues: Art, Language and Revolution in the Middle East and South Asia&quot; curated by Omer Kholeif of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and &quot;Pop América: Contesting Freedom, 1965–1975&quot; curated by Esther Gabara of the Nasher Museum. The Sotheby&#x27;s Prize program concluded in 2020, following a promise to honor existing commitments to shows that are still in formation.

===Sneaker sales===
In recent years, Sotheby&#x27;s has been selling sneakers, both vintage designs in a &quot;buy-now&quot; sneaker shop, and high-value pairs, some worn by famous people, by auction. Sneaker auctions have brought in large numbers new to Sotheby&#x27;s, from as young as 19 years old and across the world. Notable auction record-breaking sales include:

=== Porcelain ===
In recent years Sotheby&#x27;s, mostly in Hong Kong sales, has become the leading auctioneer for the most expensive Chinese porcelain. On 3 October 2017, a Ru ware brush-washer dish, 13 cm (5 in) across, set a new record auction price for Chinese ceramics at Sotheby&#x27;s Hong Kong, fetching HK$294.3 million, nearly US$38 million.

It had been in a Japanese collection, after belonging to the collection of Mr &amp; Mrs Alfred Clark in London. 

The very rare Chenghua chicken cups have recently only been offered for sale at Sotheby&#x27;s auctions. On August 8, 2014, Sotheby&#x27;s conducted a seven-sale series of Chinese ceramics in Hong Kong. A Chenghua chicken cup from the private Meiyintang collection of Chinese ceramics was sold at the auction for a record US$36.05 million (HK $281.24 million) to Shanghainese billionaire Liu Yiqian.

==Controversies==
===Illegal antiquities===
====1990s scandal====
In 1991 &amp; 1997, an edition of ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Cook Report&quot; and Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme alleged that Sotheby&#x27;s had been trading in antiquities with no published provenance, and that the organisation continued to use dealers involved in the smuggling of artefacts. From the late 1980s through to the early 1990s, the antiquities department in London was managed by Brendan Lynch and Oliver Forge. Lynch travelled to India frequently and bought unprovenanced pieces from Vaman Ghiya in Rajasthan, which turned out to be stolen from temples and other sites. British historian and journalist Peter Watson wrote &quot;Sotheby&#x27;s: The Inside Story&quot; (1997), outlining these illicit activities, which he also exposed on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. As a result of this exposé, Sotheby&#x27;s commissioned their own report into illegal antiquities, and made assurances that only legal items with published provenance would be traded in the future. It ceased its regular Asian art sales in London said that they would henceforth only be selling Asian pieces from New York, where their legitimacy could be better monitored. Forge and Lynch were removed from their posts but never charged, and they opened a consultancy in London and continued to trade.

In India, Ghiya was eventually arrested in 2003, only convicted in 2008 and sentenced to life in prison; however, in 2014 an Indian High Court quashed the conviction. Some of the illicit Asian pieces found their way to the National Gallery of Australia, and from there a piece known as &quot;Dancing Shiva&quot; found its way to the Art Gallery of South Australia. After doubts were raised and the piece became the object of an investigation beginning in 2014, it was established that it was most likely a stolen piece, and was repatriated to India in 2019.

====Cambodian statue (2012) ====
In 2012, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved to seize a 10th-century Cambodian sandstone statue from Sotheby&#x27;s, alleging in a civil complaint before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that the company had put the work up for auction &quot;despite knowing that it had been stolen from a temple&quot; in Koh Ker.

=== Price-fixing scandal (2000)===
In February 2000, A. Alfred Taubman and Diana (Dede) Brooks, the CEO of the company, stepped down amidst a price-fixing scandal. The FBI had been investigating auction practices in which it was revealed that collusion involving commission fixing between Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s was occurring. In October 2000, Brooks admitted her guilt in hopes of receiving a reduced sentence, implicating Taubman. In December 2001, jurors in a high-profile New York City courtroom found Taubman guilty of conspiracy. He served ten months of a one-year sentence in prison, while Brooks received a six-month home confinement and a penalty of US$350,000. Sotheby&#x27;s was sentenced to pay a fine of US$45 million. No staff from Christie&#x27;s were charged.

Growing out of the four-year criminal antitrust investigation by the United States Department of Justice, some 130,000 buyers and sellers filed class-action lawsuit, arguing they were cheated in the price-fixing conspiracy by Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s. In 2001, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York gave final approval to a US$512 million agreement. The structure of the settlement was said to have helped stave off insolvency for both companies, especially the publicly held Sotheby&#x27;s.

At the time of the scandal, 59 percent of the company&#x27;s Class A shares were owned by Baron Funds.

=== Auction error (2011) ===
On 10 March 2011, Sotheby&#x27;s sold a pair of sconces incorrectly attributed to Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann.

===Artists&#x27; authorship rights (2012)===
In 2012, art dealer Marc Jancou filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, suing both Sotheby&#x27;s and artist Cady Noland after the auction house pulled a work he had consigned by the artist from a sale, apparently at her request. The suit argued that this presented a breach of the consignment agreement. Noland had told Sotheby&#x27;s there were problems with the condition of her painting &quot;Cowboys Milking&quot; (1990), estimated to sell for between US$260,000 and $350,000. Jancou sued Sotheby&#x27;s for US$6 million in compensatory damages, and Noland for US$20 million in punitive damages. Both Sotheby&#x27;s and Noland argued withdrawing the work from auction was well within the artist&#x27;s rights under the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) and New York&#x27;s Artists&#x27; Authorship Rights Act (AARA).

===Activist investor dispute (2013–2014)===
From October 2013 to May 2014, Sotheby&#x27;s was the target of activist investor Daniel S. Loeb via his hedge fund Third Point Management, which owned the largest shareholder stake in the publicly traded company. Loeb criticized a number of the company&#x27;s strategies and managerial practices, asked for three seats (himself, Harry Wilson, and Olivier Reza) on the board of directors, and demanded the resignation of chairman and CEO Bill Ruprecht. In response, to ward off the threat Sotheby&#x27;s initiated a &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan barring any shareholder from acquiring more than 10% of its stock. By April 2014, hedge fund Marcato Capital Management and investor advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also supported most of Loeb&#x27;s positions. In early May 2014, Sotheby&#x27;s and Loeb came to an agreement whereby it enlarged its board and he gained the requested three seats, the poison pill was ended, Ruprecht remained in his position, and Third Point was allowed to increase its holdings of Sotheby&#x27;s up to 15%.

=== Industrial dispute (2015)===
Sotheby&#x27;s London auction house had outsourced its cleaning and other support services to Contract Cleaning and Maintenance (London) Limited (CCML). In early 2015, the UVW union initiated a formal trade dispute over low pay, insufficient sick pay, and issues summarised in an Early Day Motion signed by 24 Members of Parliament, highlighting:the unwarranted suspension of a porter following a grievance he made about poor treatment, the refusal to stop using certain chemicals which leave cleaners with breathing difficulties, chest pains and rashes, the unwarranted deduction of wages and working hours, overworking and shouting at porters and cleaners, reprimanding a porter for using the toilet outside his official break time, threatening a cleaner with suspension for not being clean shavenAfter CCML conceded the majority of UVW&#x27;s demands, Sotheby&#x27;s decided to contract all support services to a new company, Servest. This backfired when UVW staged a noisy, sit-down protest outside the Sotheby&#x27;s entrance while clients arrived for a record-breaking summer night of contemporary art auctions, including lots by Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon. Four workers were suspended and investigated for their involvement in the protest, which led to another Early Day Motion signed by 42 MPs, condemning:that Sotheby&#x27;s and Servest consider peaceful protest to be an act of misconduct; further condemns Sotheby&#x27;s decision to ban from the site cleaners and porters who took part in a lawful, peaceful protest to call for a real Living Wage, contractual sick pay and an end to trade union victimisationWith only two of the four workers reinstated, another UVW protest disrupted a Sotheby&#x27;s classic car auction in London&#x27;s Battersea. In February 2016 Sotheby&#x27;s and Servest reached an agreement to pay all outsourced workers the London Living Wage and improved sick pay.

=== Controversies involving Yves Bouvier (2016–2023)===

In 2016, three New York art traders – Warren Adelson, president of Adelson Galleries, as well as New York-based art dealers Alexander Parish and Robert Simon – planned to sue Sotheby&#x27;s for alleged fraud over the resale of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;, which they sold through Sotheby&#x27;s in 2013 for $80 million. After learning that the buyer of the painting, Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier, sold it on to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev for $127.5 million, the traders felt deceived by the auction house as to the painting&#x27;s true value. According to court papers, the traders inquired whether Sotheby&#x27;s knew the artwork could have been sold for more, and whether they were &quot;misled into selling the work for a smaller amount by Sotheby&#x27;s because Bouvier is an esteemed client.&quot; Sotheby&#x27;s filed a preemptive lawsuit stating it had complied with all applicable rules and regulations, and the dispute between the auction house and the art dealers was settled quietly out of court.

In 2018, in a connected case, Rybolovlev sued Sotheby&#x27;s for $380 million in damages for this alleged collusion with Bouvier, claiming the company &quot;materially assisted the largest art fraud in history&quot; whereby Sotheby&#x27;s vice chairman of private sales worldwide provided assessments forwarded to Rybolovlev which overinflated the valuations of artworks while at the same time being aware of the much lower prices Bouvier paid for them privately through Sotheby&#x27;s. Rybolovlev alleged that Yves Bouvier defrauded him out of $1 billion through this practice, over several years. In the Rybolovlev legal proceedings, in 2019 New York courts ordered Sotheby&#x27;s to produce documents to be used in foreign criminal proceedings regarding the Bouvier Affair in Switzerland and Monaco.

In March 2023, a New York judge ruled that Sotheby&#x27;s must face trial on fraud charges regarding four of the 15 artworks that Rybolovlev sued Sotheby&#x27;s over: &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; by da Vinci, &quot;Le Domaine d’Arnheim&quot; by Magritte, &quot;Wasserschlangen II&quot; by Klimt, and &quot;Tête&quot; by Modigliani. The ruling also allowed Rybolovlev to pursue an aiding and abetting claim against Sotheby&#x27;s regarding &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;. Upon the recommendation of the judge, both parties subsequently agreed to settle the case via mediation with a magistrate judge in order to avoid a jury trial.

=== Secrecy on Nazi-looted art ===
Numerous artworks looted from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust passed through Sotheby&#x27;s with incomplete provenances.

In 2013, a collector sued Sotheby&#x27;s for having sold him Nazi-looted art, saying that the cloud over the title made the painting unsaleable.

In 2016, letters were subpoenaed from Sotheby&#x27;s concerning a claim for restitution for a Modigliani painting. 

In 2017 Poland demanded transparency from Sotheby&#x27;s concerning a painting slated for auction, alleging that the paintings had been stolen during World War II.

In 2024 a judge ordered Sotheby’s to share the name of the client who had put a Nazi-looted painting by Tiepolo up for auction. The 18th century “St. Francis of Paola Holding a Rosary, Book, and Staff” was looted from the Jewish art dealer Otto Fröhlich, and his heirs identified the artwork at Sotheby&#x27;s.

<text>Arbutus menziesii, or Pacific madrone (commonly madrone or madrona in the United States and arbutus in Canada), is a species of broadleaf evergreen tree in the family Ericaceae. It has waxy foliage, a contorted growth habit, and flaky bark.

It is native to the western coastal areas of North America, from British Columbia to California.

==Description==
&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot; is an evergreen tree about in height, but in the right conditions up to . The trunk is usually about thick. The thin bark is a rich orange-red, and when mature naturally peels away in thin sheets, leaving a greenish, silvery appearance that has a smooth satin sheen. Older trunks are gray-brown near the base. Individual trees can live for over 300 years.

The leaves are thick with a waxy texture, elliptical, long and broad, arranged spirally; they are glossy dark green above and a lighter, more grayish green beneath, with an entire margin. The leaves are evergreen, lasting a few years before detaching. Some second-year leaves turn orange to red and detach in the autumn. In the north of its range, wet winters often promote a brown to black leaf discoloration due to fungal infections; the stain lasts until the leaves naturally detach at the end of their lifespan.

In spring, the tree bears sprays of small white to pink bell-like flowers, and in autumn, red berries.
== Common names ==
It is nicknamed the &quot;refrigerator tree&quot; because its bark contains water, and it stays cool in the summer.

In Canada, it is simply referred to as &quot;arbutus&quot;. It is known in the United States as the &quot;madrona,&quot; &quot;madrone, madroño, madroña,&quot; or &quot;bearberry&quot;. The name &quot;strawberry tree&quot; (&quot;A. unedo&quot;) may also be found in relation to &quot;A. menziesii&quot; (though it has no relation to the strawberry fruit). According to the &quot;Sunset Western Garden Book&quot;, in the United States, the name &quot;madrone&quot; is more common south of the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon and Northern California and the name &quot;madrona&quot; is more common north of the Siskiyous. The Concow tribe calls the tree &quot;dis-tā&#x27;-tsi&quot; (Konkow language) or &quot;kou-wät′-chu&quot;. Its species name was given it in honor of the Scottish naturalist Archibald Menzies, who noted it during George Vancouver&#x27;s voyage of exploration.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Madrones are native to the western coast of North America, from British Columbia (chiefly Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands) to California. They are mainly found in Puget Sound, the Oregon Coast Range, and the California Coast Ranges, but are also scattered on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. They are rare south of Santa Barbara County, with isolated stands south to Palomar Mountain in California. One author lists their southern range as extending as far as Baja California in Mexico, but others point out that there are no recorded specimens collected that far south, and the trees are absent from modern surveys of native trees there. However, other &quot;Arbutus&quot; species are endemic to the area.

It fares well in dry and rocky sites, is tolerant of salt water, but fairly intolerant of shade.
==Ecology==

The tree can be found growing along with Douglas-fir. The thin bark is susceptible to fire, but new saplings readily sprout after such disturbances. Mature trees survive fire, and can regenerate more rapidly after fire than Douglas-firs. Pacific madrone also produce very large numbers of seeds, which sprout following fire. The tree also sprouts from cut stems.

Many mammal and bird species feed off the berries, including juncos, American robins, cedar waxwings, band-tailed pigeons, varied thrushes, quail, mule deer, raccoons, ring-tailed cats, and bears. As the fruit are produced in great quantity and may persist on the tree into winter, their value as a food source is great. Mule deer will also eat the young shoots when the trees are regenerating after fire. The flowers also produce nectar which can be made into honey. Mature leaves are almost always ignored by browsing animals, but young leafy sprouts are eaten by ungulates and the dusky-footed woodrat. It is considered a high-importance winter forage species for many ungulates.

It is important as a nest site for many birds, and in mixed woodland it seems to be chosen for nestbuilding disproportionately to its numbers. This may be due to the susceptibility of the tree to heart rot, which makes it desirable for cavity-nesting birds. Pacific Madrona also provides cover for big game and small mammals, and perching sites for a variety of bird species. They are important habitat for woodpecker and sapsucker species.

=== Pathogens ===
&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot; has low disease resistance and hosts many pathogens such as heart rot, butt rot, and stem cankers. It is afflicted by a fungal leaf blister disease caused by &quot;Exobasidium vaccinii&quot; which causes mostly aesthetic damage. The species is also lethally affected by fungi of the genus &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, including the sudden oak death (&quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;) which damages branches and foliage, and a canker disease caused by &quot;Phytophthora cactorum&quot; which leads to root and butt rot. Other pathogens include Arbutus canker (&quot;Nattrassia mangiferae&quot;), which causes shoot blight; &quot;Fusicoccum aesculi&quot; which causes dieback and creates a burned appearance; and &quot;Neofusicoccum arbuti&quot;, madrone canker, which cause dead or dying branches, crown dieback, cankers, and sometimes death.
Thinning stands, soil loss and compaction, and a host of other impacts increase susceptibility to disease, especially on less dense stands.

== Conservation ==
Although drought tolerant and relatively fast growing, &quot;A. menziesii&quot; is currently declining throughout most of its range. One likely cause is fire control; under natural conditions, the madrona depends on intermittent naturally occurring fires to reduce the conifer overstory.

Increasing development pressures in its native habitat have also contributed to a decline in the number of mature specimens. This tree is extremely sensitive to alteration of the grade or drainage near the root crown. Until about 1970, this phenomenon was not widely recognized on the west coast; thereafter, many local governments have addressed this issue by stringent restrictions on grading and drainage alterations when &quot;A. menziesii&quot; trees are present.

Invasive species such as Scotch broom and gorse are a threat to the Pacific madrona as they can invade natural areas and outcompete young saplings for space, light, nutrients, and water.

=== Largest specimen burned ===
During the Soberanes Fire in mid-2016, the largest known specimen of madrone was burned and possibly killed. The tree, tall and more than in circumference, was listed on the American Forests National Big Tree list, a register of the biggest trees by species in the United States. The tree was located within the Joshua Creek Canyon Ecological Reserve on the Big Sur Coast of California. The fire was caused by an illegal campfire.

== Cultivation ==
The trees are difficult to transplant and a seedling should be set in its permanent spot while still small. Transplant mortality becomes significant once a madrone is more than tall. The site should be sunny (south- or west-facing slopes are best), well drained, and lime-free (although occasionally a seedling will establish itself on a shell midden). In its native range, a tree needs no extra water or food once it has become established. Water and nitrogen fertilizer will boost its growth, but at the cost of making it more susceptible to disease.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==
Native Americans ate the berries raw and cooked, but because the berries have a high tannin content and are thus astringent, they more often chewed them or made them into a cider. Overeating causes cramps. Native Americans also use the berries to make necklaces and other decorations, and as bait for fishing (as did the Karuk people to catch steelhead). Bark and leaves were used to treat stomach aches, cramps, skin ailments, and sore throats. The bark was often made into tea to be drunk for these medicinal purposes.

Early Californian settlers may have used charcoal from the species to make gunpowder.

The wood is durable and has a warm color after finishing, so it has become more popular as a flooring material, especially in the Pacific Northwest. An attractive veneer can also be made from the wood. However, because large pieces of madrona lumber warp severely and unpredictably during the drying process, they are not used much. Madrone is burned for firewood, though, since it is a very hard and dense wood that burns long and hot, surpassing even oak in this regard. The Saanich people of British Columbia have a prohibition against burning arbutus due to its salvific role in their creation myths; an arbutus anchored their canoes to the world during the deluge.

<doc id="541271" wikidata="Q7735740" url="?curid=541271" title="The Games (Australian TV series)">
<text>The Games was an Australian mockumentary television series about the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The series was originally broadcast on the ABC and had two seasons of 13 episodes each, the first in 1998 and the second in 2000.

&quot;The Games&quot; starred satirists John Clarke and Bryan Dawe along with Australian comedian Gina Riley and actor Nicholas Bell. It was written by John Clarke and Ross Stevenson. The series centred on the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and satirized corruption and cronyism in the Olympic movement, bureaucratic ineptness in the New South Wales public service, and unethical behavior within politics and the media. An unusual feature of the show was that the characters shared the same name as the actors who played them, to enhance the illusion of a documentary on the Sydney Games.

==Cast==
John Clarke played the &quot;Head of Administration &amp; Logistics&quot;, an undefined but important subsection of SOCOG. Clarke was apparently a former Olympic champion, but ducked the question whenever asked about which event. Gina Riley played the &quot;Manager Marketing &amp; Liaison&quot; role, and Bryan Dawe played the &quot;Manager Accounts, Budgeting &amp; Finance&quot; position. The series also featured actor Nicholas Bell as the conniving Secretary to the Minister for the Olympics, a foil for Clarke&#x27;s character. He was a guest in the first series but was made a main cast member for Series 2.

Guest stars included John Farnham, Dave Gray, Frank Woodley, Barrie Cassidy, Maxine McKew, Sam Neill, Gerry Connolly, Kim Gyngell, Tony Martin, John Howard, The Seekers and Dave Graney.

==Episodes==
The final episode was broadcast days before the opening ceremony of the real Games. In this episode, the three stars and Bell were forced to stand in for The Seekers at the closing ceremony rehearsal to sing &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;. The Seekers did indeed perform this song, but at the closing ceremony of the Paralympics some weeks later.

In one moment, the actor John Howard appeared on a video message intended for overseas release and read an apology to Aboriginal people for crimes committed against them by the Australian government. In the episode, a group of overseas countries threatened to boycott the Games unless the prime minister, also named John Howard, gave a public apology to Aboriginal people. The message was accompanied by John Clarke&#x27;s saying &quot;that&#x27;s not the Prime Minister&quot;, to which Gina Riley replied, &quot;He never said he was. He said he was John Howard.&quot; The confusion between the two men has become a frequent joke in Australia.
In an interview after the real Games John Clarke commented that most of the shows were inventions by the writers. He went on to say that if they had used some of the things that had happened at SOCOG, people would have criticised them for being unrealistic.

==Reception==
The Games was named Most Outstanding Comedy Program at the Logie Awards of 2001. John Clarke and Ross Stevenson won Best Screenplay in a Television Drama at the 43rd Australian Film Institute Awards for the episode &quot;Solar&quot;. Season 1 was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in December 2004, Season 2 was released by ABC DVD in December 2009. All episodes are on PAL format VHS.

In New Zealand, the series was one of the first programs on TVNZ 6 on 30 September 2007, the day of the channel&#x27;s launch.

In Australia, The Comedy Channel currently airs the series as part of their Aussie Gold block hosted by Frank Woodley. The show has since returned to the ABC.

==Spin-off==
Clarke and Riley were due to reprise their roles in a spin-off series &quot;The Games: London Calling&quot;, in which the characters became consultants to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The series did not go into production by the Nine Network.

==&quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; plagiarism accusation==
In 2011, the BBC TV mockumentary &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; was criticised by &quot;The Games&quot;&#x27; makers as bearing a strong resemblance to the earlier Australian series, with Clarke saying, &quot;We worked very hard on that project and we had long conversations with these people who&#x27;ve now done a show like that in Britain&quot;. The BBC denied claims of plagiarism, saying: &quot;It is a very different show, the only similarities between them are that they are both set around the Olympics&quot;.

Clarke&#x27;s website later called &quot;The Games&quot;&#x27; writers &quot;John [Clarke] and Ross Stevenson, who run a charitable institute supplying formats to British television&quot;.

<doc id="541274" wikidata="Q4807933" url="?curid=541274" title="Aspet">
<text>Aspet (; , &quot;Aspetes&quot; in contemporary Greek) was a hereditary military title of the Armenian nobility, usually found within the Bagratuni family.

The name has been derived from either the Old Persian *viθa/visapati &quot;head of the clan&quot;, or in more likelihood aspapati, later &quot;aspbed&quot; (or aspbad) which designated the Iranian office of Master of the Horse (commander of the cavalry). The Armenian army was comprised overwhelmingly of cavalry, under the command of the High Constable (&quot;sparapet&quot;), this left no room for a Master of the Horse. There are hardly any references by Armenian historians of the Arshakuni period to any Bagratids in command of the king&#x27;s forces. Like the &quot;małxaz&quot; of the Khorkhoruni family, &quot;aspet&quot; seems to have been a special, gentilitial, title of the Bagratunis, who derived from it their other, short-lived, name of Aspetuni. This title disappears following the Arab conquest of Armenia. The existence of this title and name may possibly be due to Arsacid Armenia&#x27;s imitation of Parthia, where one of the Seven Great Houses bore the name of Aspahbad.

The name of the Aspietai, a Byzantine noble family of Armenian origin, is derived from &quot;aspet&quot;.

In modern Armenian historiography, the word &quot;aspet&quot; also refers to medieval European knights.

<doc id="541284" wikidata="Q1539053" url="?curid=541284" title="The Cat Empire">
<text>The Cat Empire are an Australian jazz/funk band, formed in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1999. For most of the band&#x27;s duration, the core members were Felix Riebl (lead vocals, percussion), Harry James Angus (trumpet, vocals), Will Hull-Brown (drums), Jamshid &quot;Jumps&quot; Khadiwhala (turntables, percussion), Ollie McGill (keyboards, backing vocals) and Ryan Monro (bass, backing vocals). Monro retired from the band in March 2021, while Angus, Hull-Brown and Khadiwhala all left in April 2022. They are often supplemented by The Empire Horns, a brass duo composed of Ross Irwin (trumpet) and Kieran Conrau (trombone), among others. Their sound is a fusion of jazz, funk, ska, and rock with heavy Latin influences.

==History==
===1999–2003: Beginnings===
The Cat Empire&#x27;s origins are traced back to Jazz Cat, a Melbourne-based band, led by Steve Sedergreen in 1999. Jazz Cat was a nine-piece group from different schools and backgrounds which debuted at the Manly Jazz Festival in Sydney. They gigged around Melbourne&#x27;s jazz club scene, including at Dizzy&#x27;s, where Sedergreen was a part-owner. Late that year, Jazz Cat spawned the Cat Empire, originally as a three-piece, with Ollie McGill on keyboards, Felix Riebl on percussion and vocals and Ryan Monro on double bass. The band&#x27;s name was taken from the title of a drawing by Riebl&#x27;s younger brother, Max, and its distinctive cat&#x27;s eye icon, known as &quot;Pablo&quot;, was created by Ian McGill, Ollie McGill&#x27;s father. For a few months, both groups performed on alternate Thursdays at Dizzy&#x27;s. They started playing a variety of gigs at other clubs, including Bennett&#x27;s Lane. The band expanded in July 2001 by adding Harry James Angus on trumpet, Will Hull-Brown (ex-Jazz Cat) on drums and Jamshid &quot;Jumps&quot; Khadiwala as a DJ on turntables (later also on percussion).

In late 2001, the band appeared in the Spiegeltent at the Melbourne Festival. By year&#x27;s end, they had released an independent single, &quot;Feline&quot;, in October, and a live six-track extended play, &quot;Live @ Adelphia&quot;, in December. In early 2002, the group played gigs at the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and in March, they headlined the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and St Kilda Film Festival. The ensemble commenced its first overseas tour on the West Coast of the United States, playing at The Matrix in San Francisco and at the Napa Valley Wine Auction in June. The band received a Music for the Future grant to fund the recording of a live album, &quot;The Sun&quot;, at Melbourne&#x27;s Adelphia Studios. At the Edinburgh Festival, they played sixteen successive shows in the Late &#x27;n&#x27; Live slot between 3 A.M. and 5 A.M. They performed at the 2002 Melbourne Festival and a series of local gigs; Kate Ceberano appeared as a guest vocalist at their final show for the year.

===2003–2005: Debut album===
The Cat Empire recorded their debut studio album, &quot;The Cat Empire&quot;, in seven months during 2003 with producer Andy Baldwin in Melbourne. Between recording sessions they toured Australia, including appearing at the St Kilda Festival with Ceberano, and at the East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival in April. The ensemble was nominated in two categories at the Australian Jazz Bell Awards. They successfully applied for an International Pathways grant from the Australia Council for the Arts. The band was featured on BBC Four performing at the 2003 WOMAD festival. The lead single, &quot;Hello&quot;, was placed on high rotation on BBC Radio 1 in August. The group&#x27;s growing live and critical reputation enabled them to approach record companies for a deal to issue the album in August. They signed with EMI and Virgin Records, and, in the UK, with an independent label.

===2005–2006: &quot;Two Shoes&quot;===
The Cat Empire released their second album, &quot;Two Shoes&quot;, on 19 April 2005. It was recorded in Havana, Cuba, at Egrem Studios, late in 2004, with production by the Cat Empire, Riebl and Jerry Boys. It debuted at number 1 and until 2016 was their only album to reach the number-one position. The tracks were more Latin in flavour, with a higher proportion written by Angus than on the first album. AllMusic&#x27;s Jeff Tamarkin wrote &quot;Skipping merrily from alt-rock crunch to hip-hop beats, landing on reggae/ska, Latin jazz, and points in between, &quot;Two Shoes&quot; is clever and brainy, danceable and absorbing&quot;. The Australian version contains a hidden track, called &quot;1001&quot;, which is coupled with the track, &quot;The Night That Never End&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Sly&quot;, was issued ahead of the album on 28 March and reached the top 30. The song appeared on EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA 08&quot; soundtrack. &quot;The Car Song&quot;, written by Angus, was released as the second single in July, and peaked in the top 50.

In July, the band played two sets at the Cambridge Folk Festival. Later in the month, they performed a set on Sunday evening of Sheep Music. In October, &quot;Two Shoes Deluxe Edition&quot; DVD was released, which contained live footage of &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;The Car Song&quot;, a documentary on the making of the album in Cuba, the original video clips created for the album, and behind-the-scenes footage. The ensemble also featured on a Triple J CD entitled &quot;Like a Version&quot;, featuring cover versions of songs performed by artists on Mel Bampton&#x27;s show, &quot;Mel in the Morning&quot;. Their track was a version of &quot;Hotel California&quot; (originally by the Eagles), sung in French by Angus. By the end of 2005, &quot;The Cat Empire&quot; achieved double platinum certificate and &quot;Two Shoes&quot; achieved platinum status.

===2006–2010: &quot;Cities&quot; to &quot;So Many Nights&quot;===
In March 2006, the Cat Empire participated in the opening ceremony of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, playing their own compositions for approximately an hour as the Games&#x27; athletes entered the stadium, introducing the group to an estimated worldwide audience of one billion. The band signed an American record deal with Velour Recordings, who released a modified version of the second Australian album, &quot;Two Shoes&quot;, which included some songs previously released on their debut.

On 1 April 2006, the group issued their third studio album, &quot;Cities&quot; (aka &quot;Cities: The Cat Empire Project&quot;) in Australia, which peaked at number 11. Described by the group as &quot;between a tribute to our own city and an experiment in sounds that we&#x27;ve found abroad&quot;, a limited edition of 10,000 individually numbered copies were made available. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, they won the Best World Music Album category, and received a nomination for Engineer of the Year for Adam Rhodes&#x27; work on the album.

The band toured extensively over the year, visiting Asia, America and Europe and playing over 45 gigs in 12 countries.

The ensemble started 2007 with a busy touring schedule and US TV appearances, including the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in February, followed by &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; in March. Angus&#x27; side project, Jackson Jackson, released their first album, &quot;The Fire Is on the Bird&quot;, that month. In May, the Cat Empire performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In June, on the group&#x27;s European tour, they appeared on the Avalon Stage at the Glastonbury Festival, where the mud was so deep that Riebl and Khadiwhala performed the &quot;gumboot shuffle&quot;.

The Cat Empire released their fourth album, &quot;So Many Nights&quot; in Australia on 22 September 2007, it was produced by John Porter and reached number two. The lead single, &quot;No Longer There&quot;, was issued two weeks earlier and peaked at number 12. &quot;So Many Nights&quot; was listed at number 50 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 2007, while &quot;No Longer There&quot; finished at number 62.

In February 2008, the band concluded their Outdoor Australian Tour, with performances in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Newcastle, Canberra, Geelong, Townsville and Launceston. The group later played at an Australian Grand Prix event, sharing the stage with KISS. In March, the band headlined on the Sunday night at the East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival in Byron Bay. After this show, Angus quit the band, prompting the band to stop performing for 9 months until reuniting for a small European tour in December. 

In January 2009, the ensemble opened the Sydney Festival 2009 at The Domain. In early February, they performed at Hisense Arena as part of the Australian Open for A Day on the Baseline. Also in February, the group issued &quot;Live on Earth&quot; – a live album featuring 22 songs recorded around the world – and a DVD &quot;Live at the Bowl&quot; of their Sidney Myer Music Bowl performance, with other shows and on-the-road videos. They issued a box set which was limited to 2000 copies. It contained the &quot;Live on Earth&quot; CD and DVD as well as a tour diary written by Monro, and band memorabilia. On 28 February, the band played two free shows at Bondi Beach and Circular Quay, welcoming donations, in an effort to raise funds to be put towards the Victorian Bushfire Appeal. In March, the band appeared live on ABC Radio National&#x27;s The Music Show.

In March, the group played at the annual Bassinthegrass festival in Darwin to a crowd of 5000. They returned to the WOMADelaide festival for a second time. After touring Australia, the ensemble completed a tour of the UK with Balkan support act, Paprika Balkanicus. The tour started in July at O2 Academy Oxford. The band then performed a range of shows in Melbourne, Brisbane and the Northern Territory, before heading off to Canada for a short tour.

The Cat Empire&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Cinema&quot;, was issued on 25 June 2010 in Australia, followed by releases in Canada, the US, and then Europe. It was produced by Steve Schram and reached number three. The track, &quot;Beyond All&quot;, was featured on Triple J&#x27;s &quot;New Music with Richard Kingsmill&quot; in April. However, the lead single, &quot;Feeling&#x27;s Gone&quot;, was released in May.

A promotional copy of &quot;Cinema&quot; had been leaked to eBay about three weeks before its due date and sold for $200; EMI provided a statement regarding the leak. In October 2011, the ensemble played their 800th show at the O2 Academy Bournemouth in front of a sell out crowd. In April 2011, they performed at the West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festival in Fremantle.

===2012–2015: &quot;Steal the Light&quot;===
In December 2012, the Cat Empire returned to Melbourne to commence the recording of a new album after touring extensively throughout 2012. The album, produced by Jan Skubiszewski, was scheduled for a May 2013 release, but the band embarked on a March 2013 &quot;warm-up&quot; tour, on which they played intimate shows in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as bigger stages at the Fremantle Arts Centre in Western Australia and WOMADelaide in South Australia.

&quot;Brighter Than Gold&quot;, the first single from their sixth album, &quot;Steal the Light&quot;, was released on 22 February 2013 on the Two Shoes music label. A music video for the song was directed by Nicholas Verso for Asphodel Films. Brighter Than Gold received high rotation on Australian and European radio.

&quot;Steal The Light&quot; was released on 17 May 2013 and a worldwide &quot;Steal the Light Tour&quot; was announced shortly afterwards. The band performed nine US shows in July 2013, supported by Blackalicious and, for some of the American dates, were joined by fellow Australians Tinpan Orange. They played nine UK dates throughout October, then embarked on a European tour. Support was provided by fellow Australians FLAP!, and the tour eventually consisted of a total of 70 shows on four continents. The most notable of these performances was in Sydney, September 2013, where they performed in the Enmore Theatre. The show attracted more than 1500 people from Sydney, including Riebl&#x27;s old schoolmate who designed the band&#x27;s posters, Arthur Brammall.

In February 2014, the Romanian B’ESTFEST Summer Camp announced that the Cat Empire was the first band to confirm their position on the event&#x27;s musical lineup. The festival was scheduled for 31 July and 1–2 August 2014, on the Mogoşoaia Palace estate, approximately 10 minutes from Bucharest.

On 16 January 2015, the Cat Empire performed at Triple J&#x27;s 40th anniversary &quot;Beat The Drum&quot; celebration concert at the Domain in Sydney, along with other Australian musicians, including Hilltop Hoods, The Presets, You Am I, Daniel Johns, Vance Joy, The Preatures, Ball Park Music, Sarah Blasko and Gotye. During their set, the Cat Empire collaborated with special guests Remi and Owl Eyes. With the latter, they performed a cover of Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Confide in Me&quot;.

They were in Romania again the following year, at the Electric Castle festival in Transylvania, on 28 July 2015.

===2015–2018: &quot;Rising with the Sun&quot;===
In early 2016, the Cat Empire announced their second fully independent album, &quot;Rising with the Sun&quot;, produced by Jan Skubiszewski. The album was made available worldwide on 4 March. On the week of release, the band performed a series of secret &#x27;pop up busking&#x27; events around Melbourne, with locations given to fans via clues shared on social media. The locations performed at were Federation Square, Circus Oz Spiegeltent and South Melbourne market.

The album debuted at #1 on the ARIA and AIR charts in Australia, staying in the AIR top 20 for an impressive 21 weeks to date to date since release. Internationally successful, the album achieved Top 10 debut in 7 countries, and Top 20 debuts in 16 countries: #1 Australia, #1 Romania, #4 Hungary, #7 Sweden, # 8 Canada, #9 Czech Republic, #10 Switzerland, #13 Malaysia, #13 New Zealand, #14 Netherlands, #17 Germany, #18 Denmark, #18 South Africa, #19 United Kingdom, #20 Portugal, #20 Spain.

Supported by lead singles Que Sera Ahora, Wolves (#79 in Triple J Hottest 100) and Bulls, the band has performed live on triple J, Terry Wogan Show on BBC2 and Breakfast TV Toronto, as well as achieving extensive media coverage in all of their major markets globally.

&quot;Rising With the Sun&quot; was supported by an extensive global tour, with close to 100 shows booked across Australia, Europe, America, and Asia for 2016. Major festivals the band were booked for in 2016 were Sula Festival (India) WOMADelaide (Australia) Bluesfest Byron Bay (Australia) Osheaga (Canada) Edmonton Folk Festival (Canada) Regina Folk Festival (Canada) Rock The Shores (Canada) Pleasure Garden (Australia) and Southbound Festival (Australia), among others.

===2018–2020: &quot;Stolen Diamonds&quot;===
In early 2018, the Cat Empire recorded their third fully independent album, &quot;Stolen Diamonds&quot;, at Red Moon Studios (Gisbourne, Victoria), also their third to be produced by Jan Skubiszewski. The album was drip fed to the band&#x27;s global audience via their release strategy of releasing one new track on the 1st day of each month, where each song was also complemented with the release of a 360 VR video clip. The videos were filmed at The Mission To Seafarers Dome in Melbourne, Victoria, and regularly featured on YouTube&#x27;s dedicated VR channel The album debuted at #1 AIR charts in Australia, and #4 on the ARIA charts – their 6th release to debut in the top 10 of this chart.

2018 saw the Cat Empire awarded two People&#x27;s Choice Awards at the Australian National Live Music Awards: Best Live Act of the Year and Best Live Voice of the Year for Angus.

Melbourne magazine &quot;Beat&quot; rated the album 7 out of 10, stating: &quot;The album barely takes a break from its upbeat tempo, and flows seamlessly between funk, reggae, and ska...&quot;. They went on to say that the album &quot;...sees the Cat Empire take one step closer towards legend status.&quot;

&quot;Double J&quot; presented &quot;Stolen Diamonds&quot; as its feature album, and was also very positive in its review, saying: &quot;The worst thing about &quot;Stolen Diamonds&quot; is that you&#x27;re gonna need to clear some space around you if you&#x27;re planning on listening to it. Because this is very much a record that inspires movement.&quot;

The band&#x27;s St Kilda Festival set was recorded for Double J&#x27;s Live at the Wireless segment, and they performed a live performance on The Morning Show, as well as achieving extensive media coverage in all of their major markets globally.

With a history of putting fans in the spotlight, lead singers Riebl and Angus hand-delivered copies of the album to fans on release day, and also gave them opportunities to put their own spin on the music with a Karaoke competition for the track Oscar Wilde, and a Busking competition that included an entry from long time friends of the band, Pierce Brothers.

&quot;Stolen Diamonds&quot; was supported by an extensive global tour, with shows booked across Australia, Europe and America throughout both the single release and album release years 2018/2019. The band were the first band to sell out two consecutive shows at London&#x27;s prestigious Roundhouse (UK), and hold the record for the band to have sold out the most shows at the O2 Academy Bristol (UK) with 10 shows. Major festivals the band were booked for in 2019 included opening night of The Commonwealth Games (Australia), Woodford Folk Festival (Australia), St Kilda Festival (Australia), Doctor Music (Spain), Larmer Tree Festival (UK), Bristol Sounds (UK), Bands in the Sands (UK), (Switzerland), BosPop (Netherlands), among others.

The band released a live single, &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; featuring Grace Barbé (Live at the Odeon), on 20 December 2019.

===2020–2022: Lockdown and classic line-up disbanding===

In March 2020, the band embarked on a UK and Spain tour, of which the band played 4 shows before it was abruptly cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After returning to Australia, the band began to work on new material. During this time, they launched a social media initiative, &quot;#lockdowngetdown&quot;, encouraging listeners to make playlists using their favourite music and share them with others, in an effort to support artists who had lost their source of income due to the impact of the pandemic.

It was announced in March 2021 that founding member and bass player Ryan Monro was retiring from the band. He played his last show at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on 6 March 2021.

In April 2021, the band announced via their Facebook page that they had entered the recording studio to work on a new album, with Yuri Pavlinov of The Bamboos filling in on bass.

On 9 July 2021, the band released two new singles, &quot;Going to Live&quot; and &quot;Great Beauty&quot;. According to Felix, &quot;Going to Live&quot; was written as a response to being forced to cancel their tour of Spain in 2020 due to Covid-19, and was inspired by people in Spain singing on the rooftops during lockdown. A further two songs, &quot;Coming to Meet You&quot; and &quot;The Scream&quot;, were released on 6 August 2021.

On 16 September 2021, the band announced via their Facebook page that core members Hull-Brown, Angus, Khadiwala and career-long Manager Correne Wilkie would be leaving the band following a run of shows in Australia. However, Riebl and McGill would continue the band in a new form. On 1 October 2021, the band released the final two songs recorded by the original lineup, &quot;Sparrow&quot; and &quot;Into the Night&quot;.

The band started their farewell tour with two shows at the Sidney Meyer Music Bowl in December 2021, for which they were rejoined by former bassist Ryan Monro. They played their final show with the original lineup on 14 April 2022 at Bluesfest Byron Bay.

=== 2022–2024: New line-up and &quot;Where the Angels Fall&quot;===

In August 2022, the band began to announce the first shows with a new lineup via their Facebook page, as well as teasing new music, with new band members being announced starting in September. New members announced include Grace Barbé on bass and vocals, Neda Rahmani on percussion, former touring member Daniel Farrugia on drums, and Lazaro Numa joining The Empire Horns on trumpet and percussion.

In May 2023, the Cat Empire announced the release of &quot;Where the Angels Fall&quot;, scheduled for release on 25 August 2023. The album will include original members Felix Riebl and Ollie McGill, and their new ensemble including Seychelles singer Grace Barbe, Cuban-born trumpeter Lazaro Numa, and Neda Rahmani.

=== 2024-present: Orchestral tour and &quot;Bird in Paradise&quot; ===
On 25 March 2024, the band announced shows in collaboration with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, as well as flamenco group and long-time collaborators Arte Kanela. This was later expanded into a national tour with symphony orchestras from Queensland, Tasmania, Adelaide and Western Australia. On 16 August 2024, it was announced that the Melbourne leg of the tour was indefinitely postponed in solidarity with pianist Jayson Gillham&#x27;s performances being cancelled due to differing political views. Two intimate shows across Melbourne were scheduled as a replacement. Their concert at the Sydney Opera House on 6 September 2024 was live streamed globally.

During the first half of 2024, the band toured across Europe and North America, including their fourth appearance at Glastonbury Festival, and their first performance in Alaska.

On 30 August 2024, the Cat Empire announced their next album &quot;Bird In Paradise&quot;, scheduled for release on 7 March 2025.

On 31 January 2025, the Cat Empire released an EP titled &quot;Devil&quot;.

==Activism==
In response to the proposed dumping of around 3 million cubic metres of dredged seabed onto the Great Barrier Reef, a legal fighting team was formed by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) in late 2013/early 2014. The legal team received further support in April 2014, following the release of the &quot;Sounds for the Reef&quot; musical fundraising project. Produced by Straightup, the digital album features the Cat Empire, in addition to artists such as John Butler, The Herd, Sietta, Missy Higgins, Fat Freddys Drop, The Bamboos (featuring Kylie Auldist) and Resin Dogs. Released on 7 April 2014, the album&#x27;s 21 songs—including the Cat Empire&#x27;s song &quot;Steal The Light&quot;—were sold on the Bandcamp website.

The band have been official ambassadors for Melbourne organization Asylum Seeker Resource Centre since 2011, actively participating in events and running fundraising initiatives to support the work of the centre, including their 2016 Telethon, band member run donation drives and raffling off rare memorabilia.

<text>The Syro-Malabar Church, also known as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, is an Eastern Catholic church based in Kerala, India. It is a &quot;sui iuris&quot; (autonomous) particular church in full communion with the Holy See and the worldwide Catholic Church, with self-governance under the &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; (CCEO). The major archbishop presides over the entire church. The incumbent Major Archbishop is Raphael Thattil, serving since January 2024. It is the largest Syriac Christian church and the largest Eastern Catholic church. &quot;Syro-Malabar&quot; is a prefix reflecting the church&#x27;s use of the East Syriac liturgy and origins in Malabar (modern Kerala). The name has been in usage in official Vatican documents since the nineteenth century. 

The Syro-Malabar Church is primarily based in India; with five metropolitan archeparchies and ten suffragan eparchies in Kerala, there are 17 eparchies in other parts of India, and four eparchies outside India. The Syro-Malabar Synod of Bishops canonically convoked and presided over by the major archbishop constitutes the supreme authority of the church. The Major Archiepiscopal Curia of the church is based in Kakkanad, Kochi. It is the largest among Saint Thomas Christians communities, with a population of 2.35 million in Kerala as per the 2011 Kerala state census and 4.53 million worldwide as estimated in the 2023 &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;. It is the second largest &quot;sui juris&quot; church within the communion of the Catholic Church after the Latin Church.

The Syro-Malabar Church traces its origins to Thomas the Apostle&#x27;s evangelization efforts in 1st-century AD India. The earliest recorded organised Christian presence in India dates to the 4th century, when Persian missionaries of the East Syriac Rite tradition, members of what later became the Church of the East, established themselves in modern-day Kerala and Sri Lanka. The Church of the East shared communion with the Roman Imperial Church, within Nicene Christianity, until the Council of Ephesus in the 5th century, separating primarily over differences in Christology and for political reasons. The Syro-Malabar Church uses a variant of the East Syriac Rite, which dates back to 3rd century Edessa, Upper Mesopotamia. As such it is a part of Syriac Christianity by liturgy and heritage.

After the schism of 1552, a portion of the Church of the East entered communion with the Holy See of Rome, forming what became the modern-day Chaldean Catholic Church. Throughout the later half of the 16th century, the Malabar Church was under Chaldean Catholic jurisdiction as the Archdiocese of Angamaly. Through the Synod of Diamper of 1599, the Chaldean jurisdiction was abolished and the Malabar Church was reorganized as the Archdiocese of Cranganore and made subject to the &quot;Padroado&quot; Latin Catholic Primatal Archbishopric of Goa. In 1653, after a half-century of administration of the &quot;Padroado&quot; missionaries, the local Christians revolted and took the Coonan Cross Oath. In response, Pope Alexander VII, with the help of Carmelite missionaries, was by 1662 able to reconcile the majority of dissidents with the Latin Catholic Church under Bishop Parambil Chandy, the native Apostolic vicar of Malabar. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Archdiocese of Cranganore remained under the Syro-Malabar, but it was later suppressed and integrated into the modern day Latin Archdiocese of Verapoly.

After more than two centuries under the hegemony of the Latin Church, in 1887 Pope Leo XIII fully emancipated the Syro-Malabars, though the Archdiocese of Verapoly remained as the jurisdiction for Latin Catholics. He established two Apostolic Vicariates for Syro-Malabar, Thrissur and Changanassery (originally named Kottayam), and in 1896, the Vicariate of Ernakulam was erected as well, governed by indigenous Syro-Malabar bishops. In 1923, the Syro-Malabar hierarchy was organized and unified under Ernakulam as the Metropolitan See, with Augustine Kandathil as the first head and archbishop. As such, the Syro-Malabar Church became an autonomous &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic Church.

The Syro-Malabars are unique among Catholics in their inculturation with traditional Indian customs through Saint Thomas Christian heritage. The Saint Thomas Christian community has been described as &quot;Indian in culture, Christian in faith and Syriac in liturgy&quot;. The Church is predominantly of the Malayali ethnic group who speak Malayalam, although there are a minority of Tamils, Telugus, and North Indians from the various eparchies outside Kerala. Following emigration of the Church&#x27;s members, eparchies have been established in other parts of India and in other countries to serve especially the diaspora living in the Western world. There are four eparchies outside of India, located in English-speaking countries: Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and United States. Saint Alphonsa is the Church&#x27;s first canonized saint, followed by Saint Kuriakose Chavara, Saint Euphrasia, and Saint Mariam Thresia. The Syro-Malabar Church is one of the two Eastern Catholic Churches in India, the other being the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, which represents the faction of the Puthenkoor that returned to full communion with the Holy See in 1930.

==History==

===Pre-Coonan Cross Oath===

It is believed that the Saint Thomas Christians in Malabar came into contact with the Persian Church of the East in the middle of the 4th century. Saint Thomas Christians looked to Catholicos-Patriarch of the Church of the East for ecclesiastical authority. Although the bishops from the Middle East were the spiritual rulers of the Church, the general administration of the Church of Kerala was governed by the indigenous Archdeacon. The Archdeacon was the head of Saint Thomas Christians. Even when there were more than one foreign bishop, there was only one Archdeacon for the entire community.

The Church of the East Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb&#x27;s unpopularity led to the schism of 1552, due to the patriarchal succession being hereditary, normally from uncle to nephew. Opponents appointed the monk Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa as a rival patriarch. Sulaqa&#x27;s subsequent consecration by Pope Julius III (1550–1555) saw a permanent split in the Church of the East; and the reunion with Catholic Church resulted in the formation of the modern-day Chaldean Catholic Church of Iraq.

Thus, parallel to the &quot;traditionalist&quot; (often referred as Nestorian) Patriarchate of the East, the &quot;Chaldean&quot; Patriarchate in communion with Rome came into existence. Following the schism, both traditionalist and Chaldean factions began sending their bishops to Malabar. Abraham of Angamaly was one among them. He first came to India in 1556 from the traditionalist patriarchate. Deposed from his position in 1558, he was taken to Lisbon by the Portuguese, escaped at Mozambique and left for his mother church in Mesopotamia, entered into communion with the Chaldean patriarchate and Rome in 1565, received his episcopal ordination again from the Latin patriarch of Venice as arranged by the Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) in Rome. Subsequently, Abraham was appointed by Pope as Archbishop of Angamaly, with letters to the Archbishop of Goa and the Bishop of Cochin.

In 1597, Abraham of Angamaly died. The Catholic Portuguese padroado Archbishop of Goa, Aleixo de Menezes, downgraded the Angamaly Archdiocese into a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Goa and appointed the Jesuit Francisco Ros as Bishop of Angamaly. Menezes held the Synod of Diamper in 1599 to bring the Saint Thomas Christians under the complete authority of the Latin Church.

===Coonan Cross Oath===
The oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado eventually led to a revolt in 1653, known as the Coonan Cross Oath. The Thomas Christians including their native priests assembled in the church of Our Lady at Mattancherry near Cochin, formally stood before a crucifix and lighted candles and solemnly swore an oath upon the Gospel that they never again accept another European prelate. The exact wording used in Coonan Cross Oath is disputed. There are various versions about the wording of oath, one version being that the oath was directed against the Portuguese, another that it was directed against Jesuits, yet another version that it was directed against the authority of Latin Catholics.

===Post-Coonan Cross Oath===
After the Coonan Cross Oath, the leaders of Saint Thomas Christians assembled at Edappally, where four senior priests Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar of Kallisseri, Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar of Kuravilangad, Kadavil Chandy Kathanar of Kaduthuruthy and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar of Angamaly were appointed as advisors of the Archdeacon. On 22 May 1653, at a general meeting held in Alangad, twelve priests laid hands on Archdeacon Thoma, proclaiming him bishop. After the consecration of Thoma I, The information about this consecration was then communicated to all the churches. The vast majority of churches accepted Thoma I as their bishop.

At this point of time, Portuguese authorities requested direct intervention of Rome and hence Pope sent Carmelite Missionaries in two groups from the Propagation of the Faith to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of Palliveettil Chandy, Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar. These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, Archbishop of Cranganore, before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.

The Carmelite missionaries succeeded in convincing a group of St.Thomas Christians that the consecration of Archdeacon as bishop was not legitimate and Thoma I started losing his followers. In the meantime, Sebastiani returned to Rome and was ordained as bishop by Pope on 15 December 1659. Between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed 84 churches, leaving the native archdeacon Thoma I with 32 churches. The 84 churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church has descended.

The other 32 churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church), the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Malabar Independent Syrian Church, the Marthoma Syrian Church, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated. In 1663, with the conquest of Cochin by the Dutch, the control of the Portuguese on the Malabar coast was lost. The Dutch declared that all the Portuguese missionaries had to leave Kerala. Before leaving Kerala, on 1 February 1663 Sebastiani consecrated Palliveettil Chandy as the Metran of the Catholic St. Thomas Christians.

Thoma I, meanwhile sent requests to various Oriental Churches to receive canonical consecration as bishop. In 1665 Gregorios Abdal Jaleel, a bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of Thoma I which resisted the authority of the Portuguese padroado welcomed him. Abdal Jaleel consecrated Thoma I canonically as a bishop and regularised his episcopal succession. This led to the first lasting formal schism in the Saint Thomas Christian community.

Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Bishop Palliveettil Chandy came to be known as &quot;Pazhayakuttukar&quot; (or &quot;Old Allegiance&quot;), and the branch affiliated with Thoma I came to be known as &quot;Puthenkūttukār&quot; (or &quot;New Allegiance&quot;). They were also known as &quot;Jacobite Syrians&quot; and they organized themselves as independent &quot;Malankara Church&quot;. The visits of prelates from the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch continued since then and this led to gradual replacement of the East Syriac Rite liturgy with the West Syriac Rite and the Puthenkūttukār affiliated to the Miaphysite Christology of the Oriental Orthodox Communion.

The &quot;Pazhayakuttukar&quot; faction remained in communion with the Catholic and preserved the traditional East Syriac (Persian) liturgy and Dyophysite Christology. They were also known as &quot;Romo-Syrians&quot; or &quot;Syrian Catholics&quot;. They also used the title &quot;Malankara Church&quot; initially. Following the death of Palliveettil Chandy in 1687, the Syrian Catholics of the Malabar coast came under the parallel double jurisdiction of Vicariate Apostolic of Malabar under Roman Catholic Carmelites and Archdiocese of Cranganore under the Padroado. Thus many priests and laymen attempted to persuade the Pope to restore their Chaldean Catholic rite and hierarchy of the local church, and for the appointment of bishops from local priests. To represent their position, Kerala&#x27;s Syrian Catholics Joseph Kariattil and Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar went to Rome in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of Kodungalloor Archdiocese.

While journeying home, they stayed in Goa where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church, establishing his headquarters at Angamaly. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to Vadayar, dodging the invasion of Tippu Sultan. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, Ramapuram.

&quot;Angamaly Padiyola&quot;, a declaration of the &quot;Pazhayakūr&quot; gave the history of Saint Thomas Christians up to 1787 and advocated for the appointment of a native bishop that adhered to the local traditions.

Latin Catholic Carmelite clergy from Europe served as bishops, and the Church along with the Latin Catholics was under the Apostolic Vicariate of Malabar (modern-day Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly). In 1887, the Holy See established two Apostolic Vicariates, Thrissur and Kottayam (later Changanassery) under the guidance of indigenous Syro-Malabar bishops, and named the Church as &quot;The Syro-Malabar Church&quot; to distinguish them from the Latins. The Holy See re-organized the Apostolic Vicariates in 1896 into three Apostolic Vicariates (Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Changanassery). A fourth Apostolic Vicariate (Kottayam) was established in 1911 for Knanaya Catholics.

===Restoration of the Syro-Malabar hierarchy===
In 1923, Pope Pius XI (1922–1939) set up a full-fledged Syro-Malabar hierarchy with Ernakulam-Angamaly as the Metropolitan See and Augustine Kandathil as the first Head and Archbishop of the Church. In 1992, Pope John Paul II (1978–2005) raised the Syro-Malabar Church to Major Archepiscopal rank and appointed Cardinal Antony Padiyara of Ernakulam as the first Major Archbishop.

The Syro-Malabar Church shares the same liturgy with the Chaldean Catholic Church based in Iraq and the independent Assyrian Church of the East based in Iraq, including its archdiocese the Chaldean Syrian Church of India. The Syro-Malabar Church is the third-largest particular church (&quot;sui juris&quot;) in the Catholic Church, after the Latin Church and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

The Catholic Saint Thomas Christians (&quot;Pazhayakūttukār&quot;) came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala. The Indian East Syriac Catholic hierarchy was restored on 21 December 1923 with Augustine Kandathil as the first Metropolitan and Head of the Church with the name Syro-Malabar.

===2020s===
In 2021, the Syro Malabar Synod of Bishops announced that the celebration of the Qurbana according to the Second Vatican Council reform: the liturgy of the word would be celebrated &quot;coram populo&quot;, while the rest of the Qurbana would be celebrated facing the altar. After hearing this announcement, many priests of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam–Angamaly announced that they would continue their public facing Qurbana. Pope Francis appointed Cyril Vasiľ as the Pontifical Delegate and Andrews Thazhath as Apostolic Administrator for the Archdiocese in matters of solving the crisis but was unsuccessful. On 7 December 2023, Pope Francis wrote in a letter to George Alencherry accepting his resignation as Major Archbishop of Ernakulam–Angamaly. He also accepted the resignation of Andrews Thazhath as the Apostolic Administrator and appointed Bosco Puthur, due to Thazhath being the Archbishop of Trichur and President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India. Pope Francis then made a video message to the people of Ernakulam-Angamaly asking them to only do the Uniform Mass starting Christmas and saying there will be punishment for those who do not. When Christmas came, only 290 Churches of 328 Churches held the Uniform Mass. The Vatican is now currently discussing further action.

On 9 January 2024, Raphael Thattil was elected as major archbishop by the Syro-Malabar Synod of Bishops. Pope Francis confirmed the election, with Thattil now heading the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.
==Liturgy==

As per the East Syriac tradition, &quot;liturgical day&quot; of the Syro-Malabar Church starts at sunset (6 pm). Also the worshiper has to face the East while worshiping. This is not followed after Latinization.

According to the East Syriac (Edessan or Persian) tradition, the following are the seven times of prayer:

* Ramsha () or &quot;the Evening Liturgy&quot; (6 pm)
* Suba-a () or &quot;the Supper Liturgy&quot; (9 pm)
* Lelya () or &quot;the Night Liturgy&quot; (12 am)
* Qala d-Shahra ( ) or &quot;the Vigil Liturgy&quot; (3 am)
* Sapra () or &quot;the Morning Liturgy&quot; (6 am)
* Quta&#x27;a () or &quot;the Third Hour Liturgy&quot; (9 am)
* Endana () or &quot;the Noon Liturgy&quot; (12 pm)

The Holy Mass, which is called Holy Qurbana in East Syriac Aramaic and means &quot;Eucharist&quot;, is celebrated in its solemn form on Sundays and special occasions. During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The most solemn form of Holy Mass (Holy Qurbana) is &quot;Rāsa&quot;, literally which means &quot;Mystery&quot;. 
===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===

East Syriac liturgy has three anaphorae: those of the Holy Apostles (Saints Mar Addai and Mar Mari), Mar Theodore Mpašqana, and Mar Nestorius. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second is used (except when the third is ordered) from Advent to Palm Sunday. The third was traditionally used on the Epiphany and the feasts of St. John the Baptist and of the Greek Doctors, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The same pro-anaphoral part (Liturgy of the Word) serves for all three.

In the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pope Pius XII in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of St. Thomas on 3 July 1962 the vernacular, Malayalam, was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana. Currently they celebrate the Divine Liturgy of Addai and Mari and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.

Besides the Anaphora of Mar Addai and Mar Mari being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper (a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the Synod of Diamper. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius.
The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers, maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora. It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012. After almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius was used by Syro-Malabar Catholics. The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.

Liturgical latinisation was furthered in 1896 by Ladislaus Zaleski, the Apostolic Delegate to India, who requested permission to translate the Roman Pontifical into Syriac. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the East Syriac Rite and West Syriac Rite pontificals. A large number of Syro-Malabarians had schismed and joined with Assyrians at that time and various delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 Pope Pius XI stated that latinization was to no longer be encouraged. He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the oriental nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.

In 2021, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church adopted a uniformed manner of celebration liturgies, removing the practice of facing &quot;versus populum&quot; during the Liturgy of Eucharist. Following this, there has been sustained dissent by some clergy and laity in the Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly.

===Liturgical calendar===
The Syro-Malabar Church has its own liturgical year, structured around eight liturgical seasons:

# &quot;Suvara&quot; (Annunciation)
# &quot;Denha&quot; (Epiphany)
# &quot;Sawma Rabba&quot; (Great Lent)
# &quot;Qyamta&quot; (Resurrection of the Lord)
# &quot;Slīhe&quot; (Season of Apostles)
# &quot;Qaita&quot; (Summer)
# Elijah-Cross-Moses (&quot;Elijah-Sliva-Muse&quot;)
# Dedication of the Church (&quot;Qudas-Edta&quot;)

<text>Barber–Scotia College is a private unaccredited historically black college in Concord, North Carolina. It began as a seminary in 1867 before becoming a college in 1916. It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).

==History==

===Scotia Seminary===

Barber–Scotia began as a female seminary in 1867. Scotia Seminary was founded by the Reverend Luke Dorland and chartered in 1870. A project by the Presbyterian Church to prepare young African American southern women, who were the daughters of former slaves, for careers as social workers and teachers, it was the coordinate women&#x27;s school for Biddle University, now Johnson C. Smith University.

It was the first historically black female institution of higher education established after the American Civil War. For the first time, it gave black women an alternative to becoming domestic servants or field hands.&quot;

Scotia Seminary was modeled after Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) and was referred to as &quot;The Mount Holyoke of the South&quot;&quot;.&quot; The seminary offered grammar, science, and domestic arts. In 1908 it had 19 teachers and 291 students. From its founding in 1867 to 1908 it had enrolled 2,900 students, with 604 having graduated from the grammar department and 109 from the normal department. Faith Hall, built in 1891, was the first dormitory at Scotia Seminary. It is listed in National Register of Historic Places and &quot;is one of only four 19th-century institutional buildings left in Cabarrus County.&quot; It was closed by the college during the 1970s due to lack of funds for its maintenance.

===1916–2004===
It was renamed to Scotia Women&#x27;s College in 1916. In 1930, the seminary was merged with another female institution, Barber Memorial College, which was founded in 1896 in Anniston, Alabama by Margaret M. Barber as a memorial to her husband. This merger created Barber–Scotia Junior College for women.

The school granted its first bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1945, and became a four-year women&#x27;s college in 1946. In 1954, Barber–Scotia College became a coeducational institution and received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Today, the college maintains close ties to the Presbyterian Church.

===2004–2015===
In February 2004, Sammie Potts resigned the presidency, giving no reason for departure. On June 24, 2004, one week after appointing its new president, Gloria Bromell Tinubu, the college learned that it had lost its accreditation due to what the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools said was a failure to comply with SACS Principles and Philosophy of Accreditation (Integrity), as the school &quot;awarded degrees to nearly 30 students in the adult program who SACS determined hadn&#x27;t fulfilled the proper requirements&quot;.

This meant that students became ineligible for federal aid and that many employees would be laid off. As over 90% of the students at Barber–Scotia received some sort of federal financial aid, enrollment then dropped from 600 students in 2004 to 91 students in 2005 and on-campus housing was closed down.

During her tenure, President Gloria Bromell Tinubu led a strategic planning effort to change the college from a four-year liberal arts program to a college of entrepreneurship and business, and established partnerships with accredited colleges and top-tiered universities. She would later leave the college when the new Board leadership decided to pursue religious studies instead. 

Former President and alumna Mable Parker McLean was hired as president on an interim basis. In February 2006 a committee of the General Assembly Council of the Presbyterian Church (USA) voted to continue the denomination&#x27;s financial support for Barber–Scotia, noting that its physical facilities were &quot;substantial and well-secured&quot; and that the school was undertaking serious planning for the future. 

In May 2006, it was reported that Barber–Scotia would rent space on its campus to St. Augustine&#x27;s College to use for an adult-education program: &quot;Under the terms of the deal, St. Augustine&#x27;s will pay Barber–Scotia for the space for its Gateway degree program starting this fall.&quot;

McLean was replaced by President David Olah who accepted the position without payment and the college re-opened in 2006 with a limited number of students. During this time, the &quot;previous attempts to revive the college [which] have centered on an entrepreneurial or business curriculum&quot; were formally abandoned &quot;in favor of focusing more on religious studies&quot;. Flamer also worked to eliminate debt and worked with alumni and the community to save the college. Olah left in 2015, to be replaced by Yvonne Tracey, who departed at the end of 2015.

=== 2016–present ===
In September 2016, the newly elected Board of Trustees hired David Olah as president to once again lead the college, at which twelve students were enrolled. The school closed for spring semester 2016 academic year to restructure and implement its new strategic plan.

In February 2018, the &quot;Independent Tribune&quot; said the college was being sold and a school might be built there. President Olah said that while the college owed millions, it was not for sale. In addition, trustees said that while the college still couldn&#x27;t offer federal financial aid yet, several programs were still offered which trained students for jobs. 

On March 16, 2019, the college&#x27;s alumni association held a meeting about the college&#x27;s future. At that time, the &quot;Independent Tribune&quot; claimed the college was holding no classes. Melvin Isadore Douglass became the college&#x27;s president in April 2019, and an official inauguration was planned in January 2020. According to the &quot;Independent Tribune&quot;, most of the college&#x27;s 45 students were taking classes online.

In January 2020 the Barber-Scotia Property Task Force started working on plans for what to do with the campus. After meetings with community leaders, it was determined possible uses for campus buildings as of September 2020 included a school, a museum, and a business center. Because the gym was in good shape with a pool that could be used, an aquatics center was another possibility. Faith Hall, Graves Hall and Leland S. Cozart House were on the National Register of Historic Places and would likely be preserved, but some of those buildings were in such bad shape no one could go inside.

In February 2021, the city and the college made a formal agreement to work together.

Douglass and Chairwoman Karen M. Soares, with the aid of Congresswoman Alma Adams, were able to get a 21-year, estimated, $12 million loan forgiven. This program was administered by the Department of Education&#x27;s HBCU Capital Finance Program. The program provided low-cost capital to finance improvements to the infrastructure of the nation&#x27;s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

The Association for Biblical Higher Education said the college had inquired about accreditation but as of July 2021 had not started the process, which would take eight to ten years.

A community survey received a strong response, and studies were planned for renovating and reusing the buildings. A partnership with Cabarrus County Schools was considered. After lack of cooperation from college leaders, the agreement with the city ended in November 2021.

According to a February 1, 2022 press release, Roberta Pinckney became chair of the board.

An August 2022 article in the &quot;Independent Tribune&quot; said, &quot;seven of the 15 buildings are deemed unoccupiable&quot;, that six others needed violations to be corrected, and that the college had awarded no degrees in 18 years. The article said that none of the college&#x27;s leaders lived in the county, and that the college claimed to have 24 students who would be studying entrepreneurship, religion, and renewable energy in September 2022. College leaders announced a partnership with the unaccredited, for-profit Medcerts for health services training online. The Cabarrus County tax assessor was determining whether the college still qualified as a nonprofit; if not, land and buildings worth almost $12 million could be sold.

As of December 2022 &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; reported four students were taking classes, all online, and in 2023, the college held a graduation ceremony for four online students. An investigation by WSOC-TV revealed that Cabarrus County was considering ending the college&#x27;s tax exemption.

In a March 16, 2023 news release, the city announced that a task force formed in 2017 to help the college was disbanding. The task force accused the college of not cooperating.

A July 6, 2023 news release stated that trustees appointed Chris V. Rey, former mayor of Spring Lake, North Carolina, to succeed Flemmings as president.

On April 30, 2024, Partners for Rural Impact and Elizabeth City State University awarded Barber–Scotia College with a $32,500 grant to spearhead a workforce development program aimed at revitalizing the Sage Library situated on the college campus.

== Academics ==
The college offers the following four degree programs: Bachelor of Arts in business, Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies, Bachelor of Arts in Sports Management and a Bachelor of Science in Bio-Energy. Each academic discipline has several fields of concentration. 

==Athletics==
Barber–Scotia College&#x27;s athletic programs are known as the Mighty Sabers.

Barber–Scotia formerly competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily in the now-defunct Eastern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (EIAC) until the end of the 2004–2005 season, during the time the school lost its accreditation and could no longer field athletics teams.

Barber-Scotia were members of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) until 2015. 

In 2024, Barber–Scotia announced it had joined the New South Athletic Conference.

<text>Cammell Laird is a British shipbuilding company. It was formed from the merger of Laird Brothers of Birkenhead and Johnson Cammell &amp; Co of Sheffield at the turn of the twentieth century. The company also built railway rolling stock until 1929, when that side of the business was separated and became part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage &amp; Wagon Company.

==History==
===Formation from merger of Laird Company and Cammell &amp; Co.===

The Laird Company was founded by William Laird, who had established the Birkenhead Iron Works in 1824. When he was joined by his son, John Laird in 1828, their first ship was an iron barge. John realised that the techniques of making boilers could be applied to making ships. The company soon became pre-eminent in the manufacture of iron ships and also made major advances in propulsion. In 1860, John Laird was joined in the business by his three sons, renaming the company John Laird, Sons &amp; Co. The sons continued the business after their father&#x27;s death in 1874 as Laird Brothers.

Johnson Cammell &amp; Co. was founded by Charles Cammell and Henry and Thomas Johnson: it made, amongst many other metal products, iron wheels and rails for Britain&#x27;s railways and was based in Sheffield.
In 1903 the businesses of Messrs. Cammell and Laird merged to create a company at the forefront of shipbuilding. The company also built a number of vehicles for the London Underground. An order was placed for 20 trailer cars and 20 control trailer cars in 1919, which were known as 1920 Stock, and were the first tube cars to be built with doors operated by compressed air. They ran with converted French motor cars, originally built in 1906. The doors were fitted with a sensitive edge, designed to re-open the door if someone became trapped in it, but the mechanism was too sensitive, and was removed after an initial trial period. The cars continued in operation until 1938, eight years after the motor cars were withdrawn, but following withdrawal, five cars became a mobile training school. Cammell Laird also built a number of Standard Stock vehicles for the Underground. They were one of five builders approached to build a sample car to a general specification, which were put into service in February 1923, and three of the builders subsequently built production runs. The company supplied 41 motor cars and 40 trailer cars in 1923, 25 control trailers in 1924, and a further 48 motor cars in 1925.

In 1927, they built 160 passenger coaches for use in India. To transport them, Cammell Laird asked Watsons of Gainsborough to build five dumb barges. The coaches were loaded onto the barges at Clifton, near Nottingham on the River Trent, and towed in pairs downriver by a twin-screwed tug named &quot;Motorman&quot;, built by Henry Scarr of Hessle in 1925. They were taken to Hull for export. In 1929, the railway rolling stock business of Cammell Laird was spun off and merged to become Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage &amp; Wagon Company.

Between 1829 and 1947, over 1,100 vessels of all kinds were launched from the Cammell Laird slipways into the River Mersey. Among the many famous ships made by the companies were the world&#x27;s first steel ship, the &quot;Ma Roberts&quot;, built in 1858 for Dr. Livingstone&#x27;s Zambezi expedition, that was built in 1862 for the Confederate States of America, that holds the record fastest build time of any significant warship (nine months from her keel being laid till her launch), the first all-welded ship, the &quot;Fullagar&quot; built in 1920, Cunard&#x27;s second , the aircraft carrier (1937) the battleship (1941) and the largest vessel to have been built for the Royal Navy up to that time, (1950).

In 1898, Cammell provided the half-inch armour plate used to fabricate the four Fowler Armoured Road Trains built during the Second Anglo-Boer War. The armoured road train was the first self-propelled, free-roaming, armoured military land vehicle ever built, predating the tanks of World War One by nearly two decades.

===Post 1945 and 1993 closure===

The company was nationalised along with the rest of the British shipbuilding industry as British Shipbuilders in 1977. The yard was subject to a labour dispute in 1984 triggered by the yard making nearly 1,000 redundancies. This led to some of the workers occupying a partially built gas rig, &quot;AV-1&quot;. 37 workers were later arrested, jailed and sacked for their roles in the protest.

In 1986, it returned to the private sector as part of Barrow-in-Furness-based Vickers Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering (VSE). VSE and Cammell Laird were the only British shipyards capable of producing nuclear submarines. In 1993, it completed HMS &quot;Unicorn&quot; (S43) – now . After the end of the &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarine building programme in 1993, the owners of Cammell Laird, VSE, announced the yard&#x27;s closure. This was strongly opposed by the workforce through trade union campaigners including the GMB, led by communist firebrand official Barry Williams.

===Re-establishment and ship repair===
Part of the shipyard site was leased by the Coastline Group as a ship repair facility. Coastline eventually bought part of the shipyard and adopted the Cammell Laird name, before floating on the London stock exchange in 1997 and acquiring dockyards at Teesside, Tyneside and Gibraltar.

After experiencing financial difficulties, partly due to the late withdrawal from a £50 million refit contract for the cruise ship &quot;Costa Classica&quot; cruise ship by Costa Crociere, the company was forced to enter receivership in April 2001, and the Birkenhead, Teesside and Tyneside shipyards owned by Cammell Laird shiprepair were acquired by the A&amp;P Shiprepair Group in 2001. Cammell Laird Gibraltar, the Royal Dockyard facility in Gibraltar, was disposed of through a local management buyout.

===Second rebirth as Cammell Laird Shiprepair===

A&amp;P Group sold its Birkenhead subsidiary (A&amp;P Birkenhead) to Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders in 2005. Peel Holdings, owners of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company and 50% owners of Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders, purchased the Cammell Laird shipyard site and surrounding land in January 2007, to facilitate the proposed Wirral Waters development, although Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders continue to maintain a long-term lease on the shipyard facilities, which will form an integral part of the regeneration scheme.

In 2007, it was announced that the occupiers of Cammell Laird Dock, Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders, had acquired the rights to the Cammell Laird name. On 17 November 2008, Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders officially renamed itself Cammell Laird Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders Limited, stating that recent economic success had made the time right, and that &quot;Cammell Laird is an internationally recognised brand which carries tremendous goodwill when bidding for contracts.&quot;

In February 2008, it was announced that the company had won a £28m Ministry of Defence contract to overhaul the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship .

In January 2010, it was announced that Lairds had received a £44m order for the flight decks of the Royal Navy&#x27;s new aircraft carrier .

In May 2012, it was announced that complete shipbuilding was set to return to the yard with the awarding of preferred bidder status for two new car ferries for Dunoon-based operator, Western Ferries. Construction of and began in October 2012.

In April 2014, the government authorised procurement of a Royal Research Ship for the British Antarctic Survey, at an estimated cost of £200 million. Cammell Laird won the construction contract in 2015. The vessel, named began sea trials in 2020; she took her maiden voyage to Antarctica in November 2021.
It was announced in October 2017 that Cammell Laird had struck a &#x27;teaming agreement&#x27; with BAE Systems to bid for Ministry of Defence contracts to build the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 31e frigates.

In 2018, Red Funnel chose the shipyard to construct a £10m cargo ferry, . Construction of the ferry began with a formal keel laying ceremony on 31 May and the vessel entered service a year later.

In October 2018 it was announced that the yard had won &#x27;Lot 3&#x27; of an MOD contract to maintain the four new of tankers for the RFA in a deal worth an estimated £262m. A new contract worth £357m was also announced that would see Cammell Laird continue to maintain the five RFA ships it currently supports.

The yard was named as part of a consortium to build the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Type 26 Frigate in September 2023. BAE Systems are the primary contractor, but Cammell Laird will be used to build sections of HMS &quot;Birmingham&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The shipyard is referenced in Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; as &quot;Laird&#x27;s of Liverpool&quot;. (though it is located in Birkenhead, not Liverpool) Verne visited Birkenhead in 1859 and 1867 and states in the story that some of the iron plates for the &quot;Nautilus&quot; were made there.

Birkenhead band Half Man Half Biscuit&#x27;s ninth album is called &quot;Cammell Laird Social Club&quot;.

<text>Section 187 (often referred to in slang simply as 187) of the California Penal Code defines the crime of murder. The number is commonly pronounced by reading the digits separately as &quot;one-eight-seven&quot;, or &quot;one-eighty-seven&quot;, rather than &quot;one hundred eighty-seven&quot;.

The number &quot;187&quot; has been used by gangs throughout the United States and elsewhere as a synonym for murder; this usage has been documented in Florida, Wisconsin, the United Kingdom, Germany and Norway. It also features widely in hip-hop culture, such as in Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;Deep Cover&quot; or, YNW Melly&#x27;s &quot;Murder on My Mind&quot;.

== California Penal Code Section 187 ==
California Penal Code section 187, subdivision (a) defines murder as &quot;the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought&quot;. Subdivision (b) states that subdivision (a) does &quot;not apply to any person who commits an act that results in the death of a fetus if any of the following apply: (1) The act complied with the Therapeutic Abortion Act [citation]. (2) The act was committed by a holder of a physician&#x27;s and surgeon&#x27;s certificate [citation], in a case where, to a medical certainty, the result of childbirth would be death of the mother of the fetus or where her death from childbirth, although not medically certain, would be substantially certain or more likely than not. (3) The act was solicited, aided, abetted, or consented to by the mother of the fetus.&quot;

In California, suspects are usually charged by reference to one or more Penal Code (PC) sections. Thus, the charging documents for a suspect charged with murder would be inscribed with &quot;PC 187(a)&quot; or just &quot;PC 187&quot;. If a suspect is charged with attempted murder, then the relevant code would be &quot;PC 664/187&quot; because attempt is defined in Penal Code section 664. 

Under the California Uniform Bail Schedule, the standard bail for murder is $750,000. The standard bail for first-degree murder with special circumstances (that is, circumstances under which the district attorney is seeking the death penalty) is &quot;NO BAIL&quot;.

== Notable uses ==
On the radio and TV series &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and other California-set police shows, the characters routinely refer to murders as &quot;one eighty-sevens.&quot;

In the song &quot;April 29, 1992 (Miami)&quot; by Sublime, Bradley Nowell used the lyrics &quot;And screamin&#x27; 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin&#x27; cop,&quot; alluding to Dr. Dre&#x27;s song. The lyrics are related to the riots that ensued after the video evidence and eyewitnesses of police brutality, and the violence that was evident during that year.

In the 1999 movie &quot;Magnolia&quot;, police officer Jim Kurring (played by John C. Reilly), thinking Claudia (played by Melora Walters) is involved in a situation domestic abuse, remarks that things can often go bad if the victim does not speak up, and he does not want to come out to a &quot;one eighty-seven&quot;, a reference that Claudia does not understand, but he does not elaborate.

In the 1993 movie &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, set in the year 2032, the San Angeles Police Department HQ is alerted to a series of automated &quot;Emergency: Code 187&quot; events after the deranged gang-leader Simon Phoenix (played by Wesley Snipes) escapes from a cryo-prison facility, killing the warden and multiple guards in the process. There is confusion among the SAPD officers, as they are not familiar with the meaning of the code which seems to have fallen out of use, until Lt. Lenina Huxley (played by Sandra Bullock) queries the computer system, revealing that Code 187 refers to &quot;Murder Death Kill&quot;, stating that the last known offense in the seemingly utopian mega-city was on September 25th 2010.

In the 2002 EP &quot;From the Depths of Dreams&quot; by the post-hardcore band Senses Fail, there is a track titled &quot;One Eight Seven&quot;, with subject matter surrounding murder. It was one of their better known songs, but the band retired it from their live sets in 2013 due to the lyrical themes and Buddy Neilsen feeling that he had personally moved on from the song. In 2019, the band re-imagined &quot;From the Depths of Dreams&quot; including the song &quot;One Eight Seven&quot;, which they had not played live in over five years.

Beatdown hardcore band Sunami have become known for their use of the code in the song &quot;Contempt of Cop,&quot; where Josef Alfonso sings &quot;187 on a P-I-G&quot; as an expression of his hatred for the police. The lyric is one of Sunami&#x27;s most famous, with Alfonso often allowing fans to sing the lyric for him at the band&#x27;s shows. It has also been featured on some of the band&#x27;s merchandise since release.

In the post-apocalyptic &quot;The FP&quot; film series, &quot;to 187&quot; another gang member is to defeat them in a dance battle, sometimes resulting in death.

The TV show Detroit 1-8-7 takes part of its title from the code.

<text>Alternative technology is a term used to refer to technologies that are more environmentally friendly than the functionally equivalent technologies dominant in current practice. The term was coined by Peter Harper, one of the founders of the Centre for Alternative Technology, North Wales (a.k.a. &quot;The Quarry&quot;), in Undercurrents (magazine) in the 1970s. Alternative Technologies are created to be safer, cleaner, and overall more efficient. The goals of alternative technology are to decrease demand for critical elements by ensuring a secure supply of technology that is environmentally friendly, increased efficiency with lower costs, and with more common materials to avoid potential future materials crises. Alternative technologies use renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind energy. Some alternative technologies have in the past or may in the future become widely adopted, after which they might no longer be considered &quot;alternative.&quot; For example, the use of wind turbines to produce electricity.

==Alternative technologies listed==
Alternative technologies include the following:

* Anaerobic digestion
** Biogas
** Landfill gas extraction
* Composting
* Alternative fuel vehicles
* Greywater
* Solar panels
** Silicon-based
** Photosynthetic &quot;Gratzel cells&quot; (Titanium dioxide)
* Recycling
* Wind turbines

== Alternative technologies explained ==

=== Anaerobic digestion ===

* Biogas, landfill gas extraction

Anaerobic digestion is a series of biological processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material when there is no oxygen. During anaerobic digestion, one of the end products is biogas, which is combusted to generate electricity and heat, or can be processed into renewable natural gas and transportation fuels. Anaerobic digestion is considered alternative technology because it is a way to create energy using materials that can be broken down and reused for something else.

=== Composting ===
Compost is organic matter that has been decomposed in a process called composting, which is the breaking down of the materials within that item. This process recycles various organic materials otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a soil conditioner (the &quot;compost&quot;). Composting is considered alternative technology because it is an environmentally friendly way to use decomposed waste and use it to condition soil. Because compost improves soil structure, adds beneficial microbes, and boosts cation exchange capacity (CEC), compost improves water and nutrients in the soil, and makes nutrients more readily available to plants.

=== Alternative fuel vehicles ===
Alternative fuel vehicles are vehicles that run on a fuel other than traditional fuels such as petroleum fuels (petrol or Diesel fuel). Alternative fuel vehicles are widely known as electric cars, cars that run on a battery that needs to simply be charged. Gas is never required for the car to run, which is efficient for the environment. Alternative fuel vehicles were created because of environmental concerns and high oil prices and is a cleaner alternative. Alternative fuel vehicles will protect against global warming as well as pollution. The most popular electric car in the US is a Tesla.
Alternative fuel vehicles also include hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

=== Greywater reuse ===
Greywater is gently used water from your bathroom sinks, showers, tubs, and washing machines. It is not water that has come into contact with feces, either from the toilet or from washing diapers. This water is relatively clean water that has been used in everyday things such as water from the shower. This water is reused as a safe and beneficial source of irrigation in a yard because it is safe to plants and acts as a fertilizer. People are encouraged to use greywater irrigation systems on their plants and landscaping because it will save water and reduce water bills within a household. Greywater reuse is considered an alternative technology because it is an environmentally friendly way to reuse and save water. 

=== Solar panels ===

Solar panels absorb sunlight as a source of energy to generate direct current electricity. Solar panels are used to generate and supplies solar electricity and are often found on household roofs or in fields (especially in the desert, like in the photo to the right). Solar power is an efficient way to achieve a clean energy future. Every day, the sun gives off far more energy than we need to power everything on earth. Solar panels are renewable, CO2 free, and have low operating costs because they simply use the suns energy to produce electricity and once they are installed, there are no further variable costs. One issue with solar panels is that they are expensive, and even though they will eventually be worth it, they are an investment.&quot;In 2019, the average cost of installing solar panels is $3.05 per watt, so with the average system size tallying in at 6 kilowatts, this means that the average solar panel system cost in the U.S. is around $12,810 after tax credits are applied.&quot;

=== Recycling ===
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to &quot;conventional&quot; waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. &quot;Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling)&quot;. It is considered an alternative technology because it is an alternative and cleaner way to dispose of garbage that can be reused or used for something else. Recycling includes extracting and processing raw resources such as wood and oil to make usable materials such as paper and plastic requires a lot of energy. Recycling saves energy because the products being recycled usually require much less processing to turn them into usable materials.

=== Wind turbines ===
Wind turbines are considered a form of alternative technology because their purpose is converting wind into electrical energy. As wind blows, it pushes the turbines to spin, gathering electrical energy. There are wind farms all over the world and many even in bodies of water, as shown in the picture to the right. Wind turbines are a cheaper and efficient alternative for getting electrical energy and continue to be used all over the world.

<doc id="541322" wikidata="Q683363" url="?curid=541322" title="Cutter (boat)">
<text>A cutter is any of various types of watercraft. The term can refer to the rig (sail plan) of a sailing vessel (but with regional differences in definition), to a governmental enforcement agency vessel (such as a coast guard or border force cutter), to a type of ship&#x27;s boat which can be used under sail or oars, or, historically, to a type of fast-sailing vessel introduced in the 18th century, some of which were used as small warships.

As a sailing rig, a cutter is a single-masted boat, with two or more headsails. On the eastern side of the Atlantic, the two headsails on a single mast is the fullest extent of the modern definition. In U.S. waters, a greater level of complexity applies, with the placement of the mast and the rigging details of the bowsprit taken into account so a boat with two headsails may be classed as a sloop.

Government agencies use the term &quot;cutter&quot; for vessels employed in patrolling their territorial waters and other enforcement activities. This terminology is derived from the sailing cutters which had this sort of role from the 18th century to the end of the 19th century. (See below.) Whilst the details vary from country to country, generally these are small ships that can remain at sea for extended periods and in all usual weather conditions. Many, but not all, are armed. Uses include control of a country&#x27;s borders and preventing smuggling.

Cutters as ship&#x27;s boats came into use in the early 18th century (dating which roughly coincides with the decked sailing vessels described below). These were clinker-built open boats which were fitted for propulsion by both oar and sail. They were more optimised for sailing than the barges and pinnaces that were types of ship&#x27;s boat used in the Royal Navy one distinctive resulting feature of this was the washstrake added to increase the freeboard. It was pierced with rowlock cut-outs for the oars, so that the thwarts did not need to be set unusually high to achieve the right geometry for efficient use.

Cutters, as decked sailing vessels designed for speed, came into use in the early part of the 18th century. When first introduced, the term applied largely to the hull form, in the same way that clipper was used almost a hundred years later. Some of these 18th and 19th century examples were rigged as ketches or brigs. However, the typical rig, especially in Naval or revenue protection use, was a single-masted rig setting a huge amount of sail. Square sails were set, as well as a full complement of fore and aft sails. In civilian use, cutters were mostly involved in smuggling. The navy and coastguard therefore also used cutters in an attempt to catch those operating illegally.

==Decked cutters of 18th and 19th centuries==

The term cutter appeared in the early 18th century as a description of a hull type. These vessels were designed for speed and the name was used in a similar way to clipper in the next century. The concept of hull type was perpetuated by the term &quot;cutter brig&quot; which was used over the period &quot;circa&quot; 1781–1807 for those rigged as brigs. &quot;Cutter built&quot; was a description applied to a hull of this type and designed for speed. More generally, the unmodified word &quot;cutter&quot; soon became associated with a single-masted rig.

Fast vessels were often used for illegal purposes, such as smuggling, or by the authorities trying to prevent this illegality. Therefore, cutters were used for both. The Royal Navy bought and had built a large number for use in controlling smuggling, as &quot;advice boats&quot; (carrying dispatches), or against privateers.

The characteristic cutter hull shape was wide; many had a length to breadth ratio of 3 to 1. It had a lot of deadrise and fine lines. A huge amount of sail could be set on these beamy hulls. The rig became standardised as having one mast, a gaff-rigged mainsail, square sails and several headsailstogether with a full range of extra light weather sails. The mainsail had a boom that extended beyond the stern. Square sails consisted of a course, topsail and topgallant. In earlier examples (before 1800) the topsail&#x27;s foot had a large amount of roach and was sheeted to a separate yard that was set below the main yard (which carried the course). The headsails were a staysail, set on the forestay (which fastened to the stemhead), a jib, set flying to a traveller on the bowsprit and, in most cases, a flying jib (alternatively termed a jib-topsail) also set flying, but to a higher point on the mast. A cutter has a running bowsprit, which can be brought inboard when not needed, such as in rough weather or in harbour. The bowsprit was usually of great length, sometimes longer than the hull. The standard fair weather sails consisted of a ringtail to the mainsail and studding sails to the square sails. It was not unknown for cutters to use a removable mizzen mast for use when reaching, setting a lugsail. Since the boom of the mainsail overhung the stern, the mast would have to be removed to tack or gybe.

The dimensions of an 18th-century cutter purchased by the Royal Navy in 1763, and roughly in the middle of the size range of the batch of 30 bought that year () are: length on deck , beam , measuring just over 78 tons bm. Smuggling cutters ranged from 30 tons (captured in 1747) to 140 tons. The Revenue cutters increased in size to match the vessels they attempted to catch&quot;Repulse&quot;, of 210 tons was built in 1778. A determining factor on size was the number of crew needed to handle the large gaff mainsail with its long boom. Larger cutters purchased by the Royal Navy were sometimes converted to brigs to make them easier to handle, but still utilising the fast hull.

==Ship&#x27;s boat==
At about the same time that the decked, fast-sailing cutters of the 18th century appeared, the term was also applied to a new class of ship&#x27;s boat. These were clinker-built open boats, optimised for sailing but capable under oars. They had finer lines than the boats of that time (which had more rounded bows) and a transom stern. A distinctive feature was that the washstrake had cut-outs (called rowlocks) in which the oars were worked, unlike most boats of the period, that used thole pins as the pivot point for the oars. This allowed a higher freeboard, which was helpful if sailingwhen the cut-outs were filled with wooden shutters (often mis-called poppets) to keep the water out. The alternative, if the correct geometry for an efficient rowing position was adopted, was to position the thwarts awkwardly high.

Like some other types of ship&#x27;s boats used in the Royal Navy, the cutter appears to have originated in Deal. Some Navy Board correspondence of 1712 concerns disapproval of the captain of for buying a cutter of about in length as a replacement for her pinnace. In 1722, another ship had a cutter issued for a voyage to India, and by 1740 substantial numbers of cutters were being bought from Deal boatbuilders to equip Navy ships. The size of these boats varied from in length. 
The 1740 purchases coincided with a decision to increase the number of boats carried by warships. During the Seven Years&#x27; War cutters were found particularly useful for cruising ships, being seaworthy and useful for boarding. However, they were more susceptible to damage than the heavier boats that they replaced and much less capable of carrying heavy weights, such as anchors and water casks. The range of sizes available steadily increased. By 1817 the cutters issued came in 17 different lengths, from . This big variety was reduced when the Royal Navy&#x27;s warships moved to steam propulsion. Since drinking water could now be distilled on board, ships no longer needed to have the largest boats that they could carry to maximise the amount of water collected on each trip. The standard-issue cutters from 1877 to 1900 came in 11 different lengths, ranging from . This was cut to 5 sizes from in 1914.
The sailing rig of the cutters used as ship&#x27;s boats was usually two masted. In 1761, the larger Deal-built cutters had spritsails set on these masts, soon transitioning to a dipping lug fore-sail and a sprit mizzen. For much of the 19th century, and into the 20th, cutters were rigged with a dipping lug on the foremast and a standing lug on the mizzen. This made them similar to many of the luggers worked from the beaches and harbours of Britain. The sail plan illustration here (1880 Sail Plan) even replicates the civilian lugger terminology of having a fore and mizzen mast, and not using the term &quot;main mast&quot;. A variation on this rig, seen for example in 1887, was to have two dipping lugs.

The number of oars pulled varied with the size of the boat. A schedule of ship&#x27;s boats of 1886 shows cutters pulling 12 oars, , 10 oars, , 8 oars and the two smallest sizes of , 6 oars. The smaller boats could be single banked whilst the larger and later examples were generally double-banked. For transporting large numbers of men, in moderate weather conditions, a 34 ft cutter could carry a total of 66 men, a 26 ft cutter, 36 men and a 20 ft cutter, 21 men.

Steam powered ship&#x27;s boats saw a slow introduction to the Royal Navy from 1864. By 1877, three types were in use: steam launches, picket boats and steam cutters. However, right up to the time of the First World War, the majority of the boats in use continued to be propelled solely by sail and oar. The Royal Navy still has some cutters that can be worked under sail or oar.

==Sailing rig==
In the simpler definition, the sailing rig called &quot;cutter&quot; has a single mast with fore and aft sails which include more than one headsail. The mainsail (set abaft, or behind the mast) could be gaff, Bermuda, standing lug or gunter rigged. A more complex definition may be applied in American waters, where a boat with two headsails would be termed a sloop if the mast has a more forward position and the bowsprit is permanently rigged. An example of this is the Friendship Sloop. A traditional cutter, by contrast, has a running bowsprit and the jib is set flying on a traveller that is hauled out to the end of the bowsprit. In a vessel such as a Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter, a storm jib might be set on a reefed bowsprit, with the bowsprit partially run in from its most fully extended position.

==Other types==

===Rowing===
The watermen of London used similar boats in the 18th century often decorated as depicted in historical prints and pictures of the River Thames in the 17th and 18th centuries. The modern waterman&#x27;s cutter is based on drawings of these boats. They are long with a beam of . They can have up to six oarsmen either rowing or sculling and can carry a cox and passengers. The organisers of the Great River Race developed the modern version in the 1980s and now many of the fleet of 24 compete annually in a &quot;Marathon of the River&quot;. Watermen&#x27;s cutters also compete annually in the Port of London Challenge, and the Port Admirals&#x27; Challenge. Cutter races are also to be found at various town rowing and skiffing regattas. In addition the cutters perform the role of ceremonial Livery Barges with the canopies and armorial flags flying on special occasions.

Cutters have been used for record-breaking attempts and crews have achieved record times for sculling the English Channel (2 h 42 min) in 1996 and for sculling non-stop from London to Paris (4 days 15 min) in 1999. Events have been held with multiple teams attempting these challenges.

===Pilot===

The pilot cutter developed from the need for a fast boat to take maritime pilots from harbour to incoming large trading vessels.

As most early pilots were local fisherman who undertook both jobs, although licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, and the quickest transport meant greater income. As their fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, they needed a new type of boat; early boats were developed from single masted fishing cutter designs and twin masted yawls, and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter.

The natural dangers of the Bristol Channel brought about over many years the development of the specialist Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter. According to records from Pill, Somerset now housed in the Bristol Museum, the first official Bristol Channel pilot was barge master George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot John Cabot&#x27;s from Bristol harbour to the open sea beyond. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided Brunel&#x27;s , and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger on her maiden voyage.

===Customs services===
The term &quot;cutter&quot; is also used for any seaworthy vessel used in the law enforcement duties of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Border Force, the United States Coast Guard (because of its descent from the Revenue Cutter Service) or the customs services of other countries.

In the United States, the early Revenue Cutter Service operated customs cutters that were commonly schooners or brigs. In Britain, they were usually rigged as defined under &quot;Sailing&quot; (above). The British Board of Customs also used other vessels as hulks, which were moored in places such as tidal creeks. Customs officers worked from the hulks in smaller boats.

In the UK, the Border Force (successor to the UK Border Agency and HM Customs and Excise) currently operates a fleet of 42 m corvette-type vessels throughout UK territorial waters as border cutters, inspecting vessels for illicit cargoes.

<doc id="541323" wikidata="Q1575536" url="?curid=541323" title="Contract curve">
<text>In microeconomics, the contract curve or Pareto set is the set of points representing final allocations of two goods between two people that could occur as a result of mutually beneficial trading between those people given their initial allocations of the goods. All the points on this locus are Pareto efficient allocations, meaning that from any one of these points there is no reallocation that could make one of the people more satisfied with his or her allocation without making the other person less satisfied. The contract curve is the subset of the Pareto efficient points that could be reached by trading from the people&#x27;s initial holdings of the two goods. It is drawn in the Edgeworth box diagram shown here, in which each person&#x27;s allocation is measured vertically for one good and horizontally for the other good from that person&#x27;s origin (point of zero allocation of both goods); one person&#x27;s origin is the lower left corner of the Edgeworth box, and the other person&#x27;s origin is the upper right corner of the box. The people&#x27;s initial endowments (starting allocations of the two goods) are represented by a point in the diagram; the two people will trade goods with each other until no further mutually beneficial trades are possible. The set of points that it is conceptually possible for them to stop at are the points on the contract curve. 

However, most authors identify the contract curve as the entire Pareto efficient locus from one origin to the other.

Any Walrasian equilibrium lies on the contract curve. As with all points that are Pareto efficient, each point on the contract curve is a point of tangency between an indifference curve of one person and an indifference curve of the other person. Thus, on the contract curve the marginal rate of substitution is the same for both people.

==Example==
Assume the existence of an economy with two agents, Octavio and Abby, who consume two goods X and Y of which there are fixed supplies, as illustrated in the above Edgeworth box diagram. Further, assume an initial distribution (endowment) of the goods between Octavio and Abby and let each have normally structured (convex) preferences represented by indifference curves that are convex toward the people&#x27;s respective origins. If the initial allocation is not at a point of tangency between an indifference curve of Octavio and one of Abby, then that initial allocation must be at a point where an indifference curve of Octavio crosses one of Abby. These two indifference curves form a lens shape, with the initial allocation at one of the two corners of the lens. Octavio and Abby will choose to make mutually beneficial trades — that is, they will trade to a point that is on a better (farther from the origin) indifference curve for both. Such a point will be in the interior of the lens, and the rate at which one good will be traded for the other will be between the marginal rate of substitution of Octavio and that of Abby. Since the trades will always provide each person with more of one good and less of the other, trading results in movement upward and to the left, or downward and to the right, in the diagram.

The two people will continue to trade so long as each one&#x27;s marginal rate of substitution (the absolute value of the slope of the person&#x27;s indifference curve at that point) differs from that of the other person at the current allocation (in which case there will be a mutually acceptable trading ratio of one good for the other, between the different marginal rates of substitution). At a point where Octavio&#x27;s marginal rate of substitution equals Abby&#x27;s marginal rate of substitution, no more mutually beneficial exchange is possible. This point is called a Pareto efficient equilibrium. In the Edgeworth box, it is a point at which Octavio&#x27;s indifference curve is tangent to Abby&#x27;s indifference curve, and it is inside the lens formed by their initial allocations.

Thus the contract curve, the set of points Octavio and Abby could end up at, is the section of the Pareto efficient locus that is in the interior of the lens formed by the initial allocations. The analysis cannot say which particular point along the contract curve they will end up at — this depends on the two people&#x27;s bargaining skills.

==Mathematical explanation==
In the case of two goods and two individuals, the contract curve can be found as follows. Here formula_1 refers to the final amount of good 2 allocated to person 1, etc., formula_2 and formula_3 refer to the final levels of utility experienced by person 1 and person 2 respectively, formula_4 refers to the level of utility that person 2 would receive from the initial allocation without trading at all, and formula_5 and formula_6 refer to the fixed total quantities available of goods 1 and 2 respectively.

:formula_7

subject to:

:formula_8

:formula_9

:formula_10

This optimization problem states that the goods are to be allocated between the two people in such a way that no more than the available amount of each good is allocated to the two people combined, and the first person&#x27;s utility is to be as high as possible while making the second person&#x27;s utility no lower than at the initial allocation (so the second person would not refuse to trade from the initial allocation to the point found); this formulation of the problem finds a Pareto efficient point on the lens, as far as possible from person 1&#x27;s origin. This is the point that would be achieved if person 1 had all the bargaining power. (In fact, in order to create at least a slight incentive for person 2 to agree to trade to the identified point, the point would have to be slightly inside the lens.)

In order to trace out the entire contract curve, the above optimization problem can be modified as follows. Maximize a weighted average of the utilities of persons 1 and 2, with weights &quot;b&quot; and 1 – &quot;b&quot;, subject to the constraints that the allocations of each good not exceed its supply and subject to the constraints that both people&#x27;s utilities be at least as great as their utilities at the initial endowments:

:formula_11

subject to:

:formula_8

:formula_9

:formula_14

:formula_10

where formula_2 is the utility that person 1 would experience in the absence of trading away from the initial endowment. By varying the weighting parameter &quot;b&quot;, one can trace out the entire contract curve: If &quot;b&quot; = 1 the problem is the same as the previous problem, and it identifies an efficient point at one edge of the lens formed by the indifference curves of the initial endowment; if &quot;b&quot; = 0 all the weight is on person 2&#x27;s utility instead of person 1&#x27;s, and so the optimization identifies the efficient point on the other edge of the lens. As &quot;b&quot; varies smoothly between these two extremes, all the in-between points on the contract curve are traced out.

Note that the above optimizations are not ones that the two people would actually engage in, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, these optimizations are simply a way for the economist to identify points on the contract curve.

<text>Bethune–Cookman University (B–CU or Bethune–Cookman) is a private historically black university in Daytona Beach, Florida. Bethune–Cookman University is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. The primary administration building, White Hall, and the Mary McLeod Bethune Home are historic venues.

== History ==

Mary McLeod Bethune founded the Daytona Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in 1904. The first students met in the home of John Henry and Alice Smith Williams. The school underwent growth and development through the years. In 1923, it merged with the Cookman Institute of Jacksonville, Florida, founded in 1872, and became a co-ed high school. Bethune-Cookman College is a result of the merger in 1923 of the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Girls, founded in 1904 by Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and Cookman Institute for Boys, founded in Jacksonville in 1872 by Rev. D.S. Darnell. The new institution, called the Daytona Cookman Collegiate Institute, became affiliated with the Board of Education of the Methodist Church. By 1931 the school had become a junior college.

In 1941, a four-year degree program was developed in liberal arts and teacher training. The school became a four-year college in 1941 when the Florida Department of Education approved a four-year baccalaureate program in Liberal Arts and Teacher Education. The name was changed to Bethune–Cookman College. In 1943, two years later, the first group of graduates received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education. In 1947, the college received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Florida State Department of Education. 

The college was accredited in 1970 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1988, Bethune-Cookman College was admitted to candidacy status by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to offer a master&#x27;s degree in science education. During this period, it joined the United Negro College Fund. 

Since 2000, campus improvements have included the construction of the Center for Civic Engagement, the L. Gale Lemerand School of Nursing, the creation of the Alexis Pugh and Eugene Zimmerman Scholarship houses, and the provision of a university-owned house as an alumni center. 

On February 14, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved a name change to Bethune–Cookman University. 

In May 2017, Bethune–Cookman University faced criticism when it invited Betsy DeVos to speak at the commencement. Students protested and created a petition on change.org, with others questioning the school&#x27;s decision. The incident led to security measures at commencement, including a bag search. During her address, a majority of the crowd booed DeVos, with students standing up and turning their backs to her.

In January 2018, the university sued former university president Edison Jackson and others involved in a $306 million construction deal alleging fraud, corruption, and bribery.

The university was placed on probation by its regional accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, in the summer of 2018. The accreditor cited failings in multiple areas, including integrity, governing board characteristics, financial resources, financial responsibility, and control of finances. The accreditation action followed significant financial losses by the university - $28 million over the previous two years - and multiple lawsuits, including the one filed by the university against a former president Jackson. The nursing program had been placed on probation by its accreditor a few months earlier, related to academic issues. In September 2020, the university was taken off probation and maintained its accreditation.

===Library===
The Harrison Rhodes Memorial Library was the original library of Bethune–Cookman College which was a tribute to author Harrison Rhodes of the wealthy Rhodes family. Harrison, along with his sister Margaret, championed the then Daytona Normal and Industrial School for Negro Girls. Upon Margaret&#x27;s death, the balance of the Rhodes estate, some $560,000, was given to Bethune–Cookman College. The Harrison Rhodes Memorial building still exists as a campus hall after having been replaced by the Carl S. Swisher Library in 1941, which was mainly financed by the wealthy tobacco industrialist and philanthropist Carl S. Swisher.

== Athletics ==
Bethune-Cookman is a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) and participates in NCAA Division I FCS. Bethune-Cookman sponsors 15 athletic programs.

==Student organizations==

Bethune-Cookman has more than 80 student organizations on campus. This includes academic and honor societies, Greek fraternities and sororities, Greek-letter professional and service organizations, community service groups, leadership organizations, performance groups, and international and religious-based organizations.

===The Marching Wildcats===

Bethune-Cookman&#x27;s marching band is known as &quot;The Marching Wildcats.&quot; The marching band is the largest student organization on campus with over 300 members and starred in the Netflix series &quot;Marching Orders&quot;.

The marching band organization began in 1930 with only 30 instrumentalists.

<text>Kings Dominion is an amusement park in Doswell, Virginia, United States, north of Richmond and south of Washington, D.C. Owned and operated by Six Flags, the park opened to the public on May 3, 1975, and features more than 60 rides, shows and attractions including 13 roller coasters and a water park. Its name is derived from the name of its sister park, Kings Island near Cincinnati, and the nickname for the Commonwealth of Virginia, &quot;Old Dominion.&quot;

==History==
===Early history as Kings Dominion (1972–83)===

Following the success of Kings Island in Mason, Ohio, Family Leisure Centers (a partnership formed between Taft Broadcasting Company and Top Value Enterprises, owned by supermarket chain Kroger) decided to expand into a new region of the country by opening a second park. A site was chosen in Doswell, Virginia, with construction beginning on October 1, 1972. The new park was designed with similar themes, rides, and activities as sister park Kings Island.

Following a limited preview of the park&#x27;s Lion Country Safari, a drive-through animal zoo with 230 species of animals, and the Scooby-Doo rollercoaster in 1974, Kings Dominion officially opened on May 3, 1975, offering fifteen attractions including the Rebel Yell (later renamed Racer 75), the Lion Country Safari Monorail, Galaxie, and a junior wooden roller coaster known as Scooby-Doo. Also present at the opening was a log flume, steam train, a collection of flat rides and a cable-car sky ride that transported visitors between Old Virginia and The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera. In addition, Kings Dominion&#x27;s 1/3-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower and the International Street Fountain greet visitors near the main entrance to the park. Original themed areas included The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera, International Street, Lion Country Safari, Old Virginia, and Coney Island. Daily admission price in 1975 was $7.50, and a dollar for parking. Opening day of the park saw 50,000 guests, with an additional 50,000-60,000 guests waiting to enter.

Kings Dominion added its fourth roller coaster, a Schwarzkopf shuttle loop known as the King Kobra, in 1977. The King Kobra featured a 50-ton counterweight drop launch and was the park&#x27;s first launched roller coaster. It was in the park for nine seasons before being relocated to Jolly Roger Amusement Park in Ocean City, Maryland, Alton Towers in England, and later to Hopi Hari in Brazil where it exists today as &quot;Katapul&quot;. Also in 1977, Kings Dominion was one of several amusement parks serving as location for the film &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;.

A campground was completed in time for the 1978 season and the park&#x27;s well-known Lost World mountain debuted in 1979. Originally, the Lost World featured three rides: a flume ride called &quot;Voyage to Atlantis&quot;, a children&#x27;s attraction mine ride known as &quot;Land of the Dooz&quot;, and a rotor called &quot;Time Shaft&quot;. Only a year later in 1980, the flume ride was rethemed &quot;Haunted River&quot;. Kings Dominion later expanded Old Virginia with the addition of the park&#x27;s third wooden roller coaster, the Grizzly, in 1982 and a river rapids ride called White Water Canyon in 1983.

Kings Dominion was also active in political lobbying. They and other entertainment businesses convinced Virginia to make it illegal for schools to start classes before the Labor Day holiday in early September. They thought that if students were not able to attend school in August, then more families would spend money at Kings Dominion, and more teenagers would be able to provide a low-cost workforce to the amusement park. This law, known as the &quot;Kings Dominion Law&quot; after the amusement park, stayed in force until 2019.

===Growth under KECO management (1983–92)===

Taft Broadcasting Company sold its theme park division in late 1983 for $167.5 million to Kings Entertainment Company (KECO), a new company formed by senior executives and general managers of Taft&#x27;s Amusement Park Group. Three parks were involved in the sale – Kings Island, Kings Dominion, and Carowinds – along with a 20-percent stake in Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. American Financial Group later purchased KECO in 1987 but allowed KECO to continue to manage operations at the amusement parks.

One of the first additions under the new management group was Berserker – a looping starship ride added to International Street in 1984. Also that year, Smurf Mountain replaced the mine ride Land of the Dooz, transforming the Lost World into The Smurfs theme. Kings Dominion unveiled a TOGO stand-up roller coaster in 1986 called Shockwave, the first of three roller coasters to be added under KECO. Shockwave had one loop, similar to the older King Kobra but added a helix. King Kobra was removed at the end of the season. A water slide complex known as Racing Rivers opened in 1987, and Avalanche, which remains the only Mack bobsled roller coaster in the United States, debuted the following year in 1988. The trains of Avalanche now known as “Reptilian” were themed after bobsleds from various countries including the United States, France, Germany, Canada and Switzerland creating the experience of a bobsled race in the Winter Olympics.

Kings Dominion continued to expand over the next few seasons starting with Hanna-Barbera Land in 1990 with the addition of more children&#x27;s flat rides. A new, looping roller coaster from Arrow Dynamics called Anaconda was introduced the following year in 1991 featuring the world&#x27;s first underwater tunnel which travels under part of Lake Charles. Anaconda was also originally billed as having six loops, but unlike Arrow&#x27;s six-inversion coaster Drachen Fire that opened at Busch Gardens Williamsburg the following year, the Anaconda actually has only four inversions: a vertical loop, a sidewinder, and two consecutive corkscrews.

A new water park addition called Hurricane Reef opened in 1992. To build the water park, Kings Dominion filled in two-thirds of Lake Charles near the Candy Apple Grove region of the park. Originally it featured the Monsoon Chutes (two pairs of free-fall body slides, at 70 and high, respectively), the Torrential Twist (two enclosed body slides that wrapped around each other), the Pipeline (four open body slides), Cyclone (three enclosed body slides, the center of which was a free-fall), Tidal Wave (two open slides, which riders rode on inner tubes), Splash Island (an area for children with five water slides), and a lazy river.

===Paramount era (1993–2006)===

Kings Dominion continued its growth when it became part of Paramount Parks in 1993 and switched its name to Paramount&#x27;s Kings Dominion. New attractions and areas of the park themed to Paramount&#x27;s television shows and films appeared at Paramount&#x27;s Kings Dominion almost every season that they were under Paramount&#x27;s ownership. In 1993, they added a motion simulator attraction, originally featuring the &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; film, and Lion County Safari was removed at the end of the season. Also in 1993, Smurf Mountain was removed, leaving only the Time Shaft and Haunted River remaining in The Lost World Mountain until 1995 when both rides were removed. The 1994 season saw the addition of a new area of the park themed to the 1992 Paramount motion picture &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, which featured its third full-size wooden roller coaster, Hurler, a shop called the Rock Shop, and a Stan Mikita&#x27;s restaurant similar to the one featured in the film. Since then, the Wayne&#x27;s World section has been merged into the Candy Apple Grove; the Stan Mikita&#x27;s was converted to the Juke Box Diner, and the Hurler was converted into Twisted Timbers, the park&#x27;s newest roller coaster, in 2018. In the next year, another children&#x27;s area, known as Nickelodeon Splat City, opened near the Shockwave roller coaster, this was a product of Viacom purchasing Paramount in 1994. This was later converted into Nick Central. In the 1995 season, The Skyride and The Singing Mushrooms were removed.

In 1996, Kings Dominion introduced its second launched roller coaster, and first LIM-launched roller coaster, The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear. The Outer Limits has a launch, four inversions, and an identical &quot;spaghetti bowl&quot; layout to Flight of Fear at Kings Island. Almost as notable as the launch of The Outer Limits was the fact that the entire ride was in semi-darkness; the riders could not see where they were going. Five years after The Outer Limits opened, Paramount Parks&#x27; licensing agreement to use theming from the television show after which the ride was named expired; the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; theming in the ride and its queue was removed, and the ride was renamed Flight of Fear. Also after the 2000 season, Flight of Fear&#x27;s trains received lap bars instead of shoulder restraints.

1997 featured the debut of KidZville, a re-theming of the Hanna-Barbera section. The park added the new Taxi Jam roller coaster, and Scooby&#x27;s Playpark became a construction-themed playpen called Kidz Construction Company. Yogi&#x27;s Cave was rethemed to Treasure Cave and many rides in KidZville, such as Scooby-Doo&#x27;s Ghoster Coaster, George Jetson&#x27;s Spaceport, and Huck&#x27;s Hot Rods, continued to bear the names of Hanna-Barbera characters.
Kings Dominion added another launched roller coaster in 1998, , in the former Lost World mountain. The mountain&#x27;s previous rides had all been removed several years previously, and Volcano gave the mountain a major transformation. Volcano, which was manufactured by Intamin, was the world&#x27;s first LIM-launched inverted roller coaster. The ride featured two separate launch sections, a roll-out inversion on the top of the mountain, and three heartline rolls on the way back down. Volcano was themed to the 1997 film &quot;Volcano&quot;; the other Paramount Parks added inverted or suspended roller coasters themed to &quot;Top Gun&quot; around the same time. During the next two seasons, Kings Dominion expanded Hurricane Reef behind the Rebel Yell and renamed it WaterWorks. The new portion of WaterWorks includes Pipeline Peak, a set of four enclosed water slides, one of which (the Night Slider) is the world&#x27;s tallest dark free-fall slide. In 2000, Nick Central opened, replacing Nick Splat City and part of Kidzville.

The park added its third launched roller coaster, Hypersonic XLC, in 2001. Hypersonic XLC, a Thrust Air 2000 air-launched coaster made by S&amp;S Power, launched riders from 0 to in 1.5 seconds, taking them up an 87-degree incline and down an 87-degree drop. The entire ride&#x27;s duration was about 25 seconds. Hypersonic XLC broke down frequently and was closed for the first three months of its second season; no other Paramount Parks installed a similar ride. Nevertheless, Hypersonic XLC helped establish Kings Dominion&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the launched coaster capital of the world&quot;. Hypersonic XLC was removed after the 2007 season.

The early 2000s saw Kings Dominion opening new rides similar to existing rides at other Paramount Parks. In 2002, the park opened its new wild mouse roller coaster, Ricochet (Now known as Apple Zapple), Carowinds also installed its Ricochet in 2002. Diamond Falls, the Shoot the Chute ride closed that season. The 2003 season saw Kings Dominion become the final of several of the Paramount Parks to open a Drop Zone: Stunt Tower, now Drop Tower: Scream Zone. The Drop Zone at Kings Dominion was the tallest freefall ride in the world at the time it opened. In 2004, Kings Dominion added Scooby-Doo! And the Haunted Mansion; similar Scooby-Doo-themed dark rides had opened at three other Paramount Parks during the three previous seasons. In the next season, Kings Dominion added a Huss Top Spin called Tomb Raider: Firefall, and was named The Crypt, which was a standard size and outdoor version of a similar, but larger, ride named Tomb Raider: The Ride, also now The Crypt, at Kings Island. The differences between the two were that at Kings Dominion riders&#x27; feet dangle freely and at Kings Island, which installed a Giant Top Spin, there was a floor. In the 2006 season, Kings Dominion opened the Italian Job Turbo Coaster, its fourth launched roller coaster. Unlike the previously built launched coasters at Kings Dominion, each of which was faster than its predecessor, the Italian Job Turbo Coaster was designed more like a family ride and features multiple launches at . The coaster was later renamed the &quot;Backlot Stunt Coaster&quot; in 2008. It is similar to the &quot;Backlot Stunt Coaster&quot; rides at Kings Island and Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, which both opened in 2005.

===Cedar Fair/Six Flags era (2006–present)===
On January 27, 2006, it was reported that CBS Corporation (successor of the original Viacom), and owner of Paramount Parks, was interested in selling all of its theme parks, including Paramount&#x27;s Kings Dominion. CBS stated that amusement parks did not fit the company&#x27;s new strategy. On May 14, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it was interested in acquiring the five Paramount theme parks from CBS Corporation. The acquisition was completed on June 30, 2006.

Although Cedar Fair continued to use the Paramount&#x27;s Kings Dominion name through the remainder of the 2006 season, and had a ten-year option to continue using the Paramount pre-fix, it began to phase out the Paramount name in press releases, the park website, and signage within the park.

Kings Dominion expanded WaterWorks for the 2007 season, adding a second wave pool called Tidal Wave Bay, a four-person family raft slide called Zoom Flume, and a ProSlide Tornado.

During the Cedar Fair era, the park introduced Halloween Haunt. While the park had always had a Halloween event, the new HAUNT event has been received very well.

In December 2006, Kings Dominion put Hypersonic XLC up for sale. The park announced plans to keep it running until a buyer was found. It remained in operation during the 2007 season and was closed and dismantled several weeks before the 2008 season started. Also during the 2007–2008 off-season, Cedar Fair renamed the park&#x27;s last rides to open with Paramount theming. Drop Zone Stunt Tower became Drop Tower Scream Zone and The Italian Job: Turbo Coaster became Backlot Stunt Coaster. Tomb Raider: Firefall also received the name The Crypt. The Paramount Theater also changed its name to Kings Dominion Theater.
The 2008 and 2009 seasons saw Kings Dominion receive three rides that had operated at Geauga Lake during its dry amusement park&#x27;s final season. On October 23, 2007, Kings Dominion announced that Dominator, a floorless roller coaster, would be moved to Kings Dominion and located in the International Street section. Dominator opened on May 24, 2008, becoming Kings Dominion&#x27;s first roller coaster with five inversions. For the 2009 season, two flat rides once located at Geauga Lake, like Dominator, opened in 2008. Located near Rebel Yell, Americana became Kings Dominion&#x27;s first Ferris wheel.

For the 2010 season, Kings Dominion opened Intimidator 305, a giga coaster by Intamin. The ride features a cable lift hill, an 85° first drop and a maximum speed of . The ride, which is themed to NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, was announced on August 20, 2009, and represents the park&#x27;s largest-ever capital investment. It was opened to the public in April 2010. Also for the 2010 season, the Kidzville and Nickelodeon Universe areas of the park began being re-themed to Planet Snoopy, as were the children&#x27;s areas at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland and Kings Island. The park has renamed the Hanna-Barbera-themed rides in Kidzville to match the Planet Snoopy theme, ending the park&#x27;s 35-year run with Scooby-Doo and other Hanna-Barbera characters.

For the 2012 season, Kings Dominion installed WindSeeker in the Grove section of the park next to the Juke Box Diner. There are other versions of the ride in Cedar Fair parks such as Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, Cedar Point, Kings Island, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, and Carowinds. The ride stands and gives riders a view of the surrounding area. Kings Dominion also added Dinosaurs Alive!, an upcharge dinosaur walkthrough exhibit, located in the Old Virginia section of the park. This attraction also appeared at Kings Island, Dorney Park, Cedar Point, and Canada&#x27;s Wonderland.

For the 2013 season, Planet Snoopy merged with KidZville during a expansion to form the largest Planet Snoopy in the Cedar Fair chain. There are now 18 attractions covering .

For the 2014 season, Kings Dominion commemorated the 40th anniversary of Lion Country Safari and the preview-opening of Kings Dominion by returning park icons from past eras. These icons included the return of the classic singing mushrooms, the repainting of Anaconda, an improved queue line for Volcano: The Blast Coaster, the return of classic blue ice cream, among other additions. They also returned the Rebel Yell roller coaster to its original red and blue colors. The 2014 season also saw the return of the iconic floral clock, the popular clown band, and the renaming of Johnny&#x27;s and Trail&#x27;s End Grill restaurants to the original names, Dinner Bell and Hungry Hippo, respectively. New lighting packages were added to the International Street fountains and Rebel Yell. The Congo and Grove sections of the park were returned to the original themes, Safari Village and Candy Apple Grove, respectively.

For the 2015 season, Kings Dominion continued in celebration of its 40th anniversary with a major expansion to WaterWorks. The expansion included a new 65-foot tall slide complex featuring three different attractions called Paradise Plunge, Aqua Blast, and Thunder Falls; a new children&#x27;s area called Splash Island; expanded cabana areas, updated bathhouses, and other improvements to the area. As part of the major water park expansion, the area was renamed Soak City. On August 9, 2015, Shockwave closed in Candy Apple Grove permanently, and a swinging pendulum ride titled &quot;Delirium&quot; was built in its place. Hurler closed permanently at the end of the season on November 1, 2015. In 2017, Planet Snoopy was expanded with the addition of three new children&#x27;s rides in the former Nickelodeon Central side of the area. On October 15, 2016, Kings Dominion announced that the Hurler wooden coaster would be permanently closed.

For the 2018 season, Kings Dominion opened Twisted Timbers on March 24, 2018, three years after Hurler operated for the last time, converting the track from wood to steel. It was built by Rocky Mountain Construction utilizing many of the original wooden supports from Hurler. 2018 also marked the debut of WinterFest, a Christmas-themed holiday event, during the winter season. The Rebel Yell and Ricochet coasters were renamed Racer 75 and Apple Zapple, respectively. Tornado, Dinosaurs Alive, and Volcano: The Blast Coaster were all removed before the 2019 season.

In August 2019, Kings Dominion announced that Soak City would be expanded in 2020 to include a new sub-area called Coconut Shores, featuring a multi-level water play structure and a children&#x27;s wave pool. In January 2020, the park also announced the removal of The Crypt to make room for future development in the Safari Village section of the park.

Kings Dominion did not open for its normal operating schedule in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After restrictions were partially lifted by Virginia governor Ralph Northam in November 2020, the park opened for a limited capacity winter event titled &quot;Taste of the Season&quot; that operated for three weeks the following month in December. The event featured specialty food trucks, seasonal decorations, a small selection of rides.

Normal operation resumed for the 2021 season, and in August of that year, the park announced that Safari Village would receive a makeover for 2022. The upgraded section of the park, Jungle X-Pedition, is themed to an archeological research facility and dig site. The area received similarly themed restaurants and retail shops, as well as a new roller coaster named Tumbili, a 4D Free Spin model manufactured by S&amp;S – Sansei Technologies.

On July 1, 2024, a merger of equals between Cedar Fair and Six Flags was completed, creating Six Flags Entertainment Corporation.

==Areas and attractions==

===Candy Apple Grove===
Candy Apple Grove was known as Coney Island when the park first opened in 1975. It was renamed Candy Apple Grove in 1976. The area is Kings Dominion&#x27;s largest section in the park, and in its early years, it featured an orchard theme that included three apple-themed rides: Apple Turnover, Bad Apple, and Adam&#x27;s Apple. Much of the apple-related themes were removed over the years, and the area became known as simply &quot;The Grove&quot; when it merged with the former Wayne&#x27;s World area in 2001.
As part of Kings Dominion&#x27;s 40th-anniversary celebration in 2014, The Grove was restored to its original orchard theme, and the name was changed back to Candy Apple Grove. The animatronic Singing Mushrooms, popular decades ago, was redeveloped with newer technology and placed back on display. Other features that made a return to the area include a fully restored floral clock near the Carousel, oversized candy apples, and the popular blue ice cream that existed in the park for decades.

The westernmost corner of Candy Apple Grove, distinct from the rest of the area, is themed to the 1950s.

Some of the area&#x27;s more notable rides include WindSeeker, a swing ride that opened in 2012, and Delirium, a type of pendulum amusement ride that opened in place of stand-up roller coaster Shockwave in 2016. Candy Apple Grove&#x27;s newest ride, steel coaster Twisted Timbers, opened in 2018 replacing Hurler and reusing some of the previous support structure. In addition to rides, the area features an arcade, carnival games, counter-service restaurants, and a gift shop.

===International Street===
International Street is the park&#x27;s main entry area, featuring a rectangular fountain pool in the center of the walkway, which leads up to a 1/3 scale replica of the Eiffel Tower. Guests can ascend the tower by elevator up to the observation deck. International Street is designed to showcase a variety of European architecture, with buildings representing France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Italy. The buildings contain an assortment of gift shops, specialty shops, cafés and eateries. The International Street section of the park, which originally included the walkway, buildings, and Eiffel Tower, was expanded under Paramount ownership to include the former Action Theater.

=== Jungle X-Pedition ===
Jungle X-Pedition is themed to an archeological base camp in a mysterious jungle. The area&#x27;s fictional backstory centers around an explorer who discovered the uncharted land in 1935, naming the location &quot;Site X.&quot; Initially, the area was part of one of the park&#x27;s original attractions, Lion Country Safari, which contained a monorail train through a nature preserve until its closure in the 1990s. The area&#x27;s name changed from Lion Country Safari to Safari Village in the mid-1980s and was changed again by Paramount to Congo in the 1990s. In 2014, the area&#x27;s name reverted to Safari Village to commemorate the park&#x27;s 40th anniversary. For the 2022 season, the area was rethemed to Jungle X-Pedition, which includes new immersive theming elements, dining, shopping, and a new roller coaster, Tumbili.

The area is home to many of the park&#x27;s thrill rides and roller coasters. From 1979 until 2019, the area was anchored by a large artificial mountain, originally home to the Lost World ride complex and later to ; the structure was demolished with the coaster in spring 2019.

===Old Virginia===

Along with International Street, Old Virginia is the only original section of Kings Dominion that has kept its same name throughout the park&#x27;s history. Set in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the area has a vintage, rustic theme marked by its wooded architecture and country-style decor. An Intamin Flying Dutchman flat ride called Jamestown Landing operated in Old Virginia through the 1970s, and was removed in 1980. A steam train ride called Old Dominion Line operated nearby in the same park section. It has since been removed.

===Planet Snoopy===
While under Paramount ownership, Nickelodeon Splat City debuted in 1995, which was later renamed Nickelodeon Central in 2000. After Cedar Fair acquired the park, the area was redesigned in 2010 using a &quot;Peanuts&quot; theme, one of Cedar Fair&#x27;s(now Six Flags) predominant I.P.s, with Snoopy serving as one of the central characters. In 2013, Kings Dominion merged the KidZville section of the park, introducing new attractions and retheming others. Another expansion in 2017 updated the former Nickelodeon Central area of Planet Snoopy with three new attractions and a covered pavilion area.

===Soak City===

Soak City, formerly known as WaterWorks, is Kings Dominion&#x27;s water park. It opened in 1992 as Hurricane Reef and is included with admission to Kings Dominion. In 2015, the water park was expanded and re-branded as Soak City.

==Fast Lane==
Fast Lane is Kings Dominion&#x27;s virtual queue system. For an increased cost, visitors get a wristband enabling them to get to the front of the line on 17 of the most popular attractions without queueing.

==Halloween Haunt==

Halloween Haunt is an annual Halloween event at Kings Dominion on weekends during the months of September and October. It debuted in 2001 as &quot;FearFest,&quot; but following Cedar Fair&#x27;s acquisition of the park, the event was renamed &quot;Halloween Haunt&quot; in 2007. In 2017, Kings Dominion&#x27;s Halloween Haunt was voted the second-best theme park Halloween event by USA Today. Kings Dominion cancelled the event in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2013, Halloween Haunt featured a walk-through maze called Miner&#x27;s Revenge. Advertisements for the attraction characterized it as &quot;the worst coal mine accident in history,&quot; and the attraction featured depictions of dead miners&#x27; bodies that had been mangled by a mining disaster. The attraction drew criticism in the press due to the region&#x27;s experience with mining disasters. &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Peter Galuszka (author of a book on the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster) said the attraction &quot;hits a little too close to home for me&quot; since &quot;the idea of abandonment is a difficult topic for miners&quot;. He added, &quot;At Kings Dominion, the suggestion of living miners left to die is meant to inject some enjoyable dramatic tension&quot;. Kathleen Geier of &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; decried, &quot;agonizing deaths are being served up for fun and profit to the gawking, peanut-crunching masses&quot; and asked, &quot;What next – a thrill ride based on the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh? Auschwitz: The Theme Park?&quot;. Following the controversy, Kings Dominion dropped Miner&#x27;s Revenge from its Halloween maze lineup the following season.

<doc id="541329" wikidata="Q443712" url="?curid=541329" title="Kenji Kawai">
<text>is a Japanese music composer and arranger. Known as one of the biggest names in the soundtrack world, he has worked on a wide range of mixed media productions, including anime, TV shows, films and video games. Among his credits are Toei&#x27;s &quot;Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Forever&quot;, Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;Seven Swords&quot; and &quot;Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon&quot;; Wilson Yip&#x27;s &quot;Ip Man&quot;; Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s films &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Mobile Police Patlabor&quot;, the OVA and TV anime adaptations of &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot;, &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot; and &quot;Avalon&quot;; the anime adaptations of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;; the live-action adaptation of &quot;Gantz&quot; and Hideo Nakata&#x27;s films &quot;Ring&quot;, &quot;Ring 2&quot;, &quot;Chaos&quot;, &quot;Dark Water&quot; and &quot;Kaidan&quot;.

His nephew, Hidehiro Kawai, is a bassist in Fox Capture Plan, an instrumental band.

== Career ==
After dropping out of a nuclear engineering program at Tokai University, Kawai began studying music at Shobi Music Academy. However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions. Through competing in such contests, the band members became technically competent to enter the music industry and decided to part ways.

After leaving Muse, Kawai began composing music for commercials in his home studio. While recording music for radio actor and voice actor Yūji Mitsuya, he met music director Naoko Asari, who advised him to compose anime soundtracks. Some of his work for anime soundtracks can be found in &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. According to Kawai, he is not good at creating music from nothing, as he draws sounds from the visuals of the works. In the majority of cases, the images of the anime are not yet created, so he creates music when referencing storyboard visuals.

Following his success as an anime movies music composer, he became involved in live action movies. He contributed music to horror films: &quot;Ring&quot;, &quot;Ring 2&quot;, &quot;Dark Water&quot;, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film &quot;Avalon&quot;, the Hong Kong film &quot;Seven Swords&quot; and in the 2017 live action film &quot;Death Note&quot;.

Kawai has worked on several projects with director Mamoru Oshii (both Headgear members) and has written scores for all of Hideo Nakata&#x27;s films. The most recent film featuring his music is 2009&#x27;s &quot;Assault Girls&quot; by director Oshii. Kawai&#x27;s music has received the Annie Award and Hong Kong Film Award. In 2005, &quot;Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence&quot; he was nominated for an Annie Award.

For the music found in &quot;Seven Swords&quot; and &quot;A Battle of Wits&quot; he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.

<text>Sands End is an area of the ancient parish of Fulham, formerly in the County of Middlesex, which is now the southernmost part of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, England. In a deep loop of the River Thames, between the tidal Chelsea Creek and the old Peterborough estate, west of Wandsworth Bridge, its northern edge is New King&#x27;s Road. While wharves, industrial acres and workers&#x27; cottages gave way to intensive re-development such as Chelsea Harbour and Imperial Wharf in the last quarter of the 20th-century, it still contains some 300-year-old cottages and 19th century streets.

==History==

For centuries, this swampy place was a rural backwater, cut off from other villages and the main thoroughfares into the City of London. Its earliest recorded landowner was John de Saundeford in the reign of Edward I. Barbara Denny, a contemporary historian, wrote that King Henry VIII granted the manor of Sandford to the Abbot of Westminster, but that in 1549 it returned to the Crown.

Ten years later, Queen Mary sold it to a mercer from London, William Maynard. Although the estate had a manor house, for centuries the land was used mainly for pasture. Singing nightingales in the 17th-century are said to have arrested the attention of essayist and politician, Joseph Addison (1672–1719), who came to live in his &#x27;retreat&#x27; hereabouts, but probably not in Sandford Manor House, which is in present-day Rewell Street, and Grade II* listed. Another reputed resident was Nell Gwyn.
===Origins===
The historian of Fulham, Charles Féret (1852–1921), devotes several chapters of his three-volume work to the origins of Sands End. As distinct from ownership, settlement of the area did not begin till the Elizabethan era, as can be inferred from this extract from Féret:&quot;A small volume might, indeed, be filled by citations of similar entries referring to lands which had belonged to Goldhawk &#x27;at the Sand.&#x27; In the earlier Court Rolls one or two other persons are described as &#x27;atte Sonde&#x27;. In 1454 we hear of a &#x27;John Burton atte Sonde.&#x27; In a presentment of 1569 there is mentioned a &#x27;Thomas Burton of Sandes.&#x27; It is not till the time of the Virgin Queen that we hear of the &#x27;End,&#x27; from which we may infer that the nucleus of a tiny village was only then in course of formation. The earliest instance of the name is in 1566, when mention is made of the &#x27;bridge at Sandeande.&#x27; In 1575 John Powell, gent, was required to make his fence between &#x27;Gill Hale&#x27; and the premises of John Burton at &#x27;Sands Ende.&#x27; Two years later this John Burton was ordered to scour his ditches (foveas) at &#x27;Sand End&#x27;, between &#x27;Gilhalle&#x27; and &#x27;Peasecroft&#x27; (see vol. ii. p. 83)&quot;

===Industrialisation===

In spite of its rural charms, the area was affected by flooding, dampness and the effluent descending from Counter&#x27;s Creek, sometimes referred to as a sewer, so by the early 19th-century, the estate was in decline. Dr Barton MD, author of &#x27;the Lost Rivers of London&#x27;, quotes a colleague from the West London Medical Journal, who had observed that rheumatism was unusually common on both sides of Counter&#x27;s Creek from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Chelsea.

In 1824, twenty acres of the estate were bought by the Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company, the first public utility enterprise in the world. So began almost two centuries of industrialisation and manufacturing. Craftsmen and artists were still attracted to its fringes, most notably, William De Morgan, a friend of William Morris and a member of the Arts and Crafts movement.

The growth of the Temperance movement produced yet another brewery in Fulham, only without any alcohol content. On an eight-acre site in Sands End, just east of Wandsworth Bridge, the Polish-born entrepreneur, Henry Lowenfeld built the Kops Brewery that started production in 1890. It lasted to the dawn of World War I when it was turned into a margarine factory and later turned to food logistics.

In 1901, Fulham Council built its gasworks here, while MacFarlane Lang had established its biscuit factory nearby. Sands End became noted as a close knit working class community in the industrial heartland of Fulham with its gas works, power station and petrol depot providing work for generations of local families.


==21st-century==
A property boom begun in the 1970s coupled with the advent of oil-fuelled processing of North Sea oil led to a process of Gentrification with offices and studio businesses and flats on the market for prices more customary in the centre of the capital. 
On the northern bank of the Thames there is Hurlingham Retail Park, which includes an electrical retailer and tile stores. There is also a business enterprise centre in the Sulivan district. Across the other side of Townmead Road there is a very large food and home wares supermarket, and Imperial Wharf, a brownfield development of the former Imperial Gasworks which is growing to include a mixture of affordable housing, both private and public, shops, a park and a new railway station.

Also in this part of Fulham is South Park. Wandsworth Bridge Road runs through Sands End and has restaurants, tile and pine furniture shops, and the Church of England parish church of Saint Matthew.

==Transport==

Because of the notoriously poor transport links for the area (including Chelsea Harbour), including the absence of tube stations due to the many medieval plague pits which deterred their building in Victorian times, the nearby Imperial Wharf station was opened on 27 September 2009, providing direct rail links with Clapham Junction and Willesden Junction via Kensington (Olympia). Southern also provides direct train services from Imperial Wharf to and East Croydon. It is hoped that the area will be re-vitalized by the new station and transport links in the areas which were previously served only by bus routes 391 and C3.

River bus services are provided at peak hours by London River Services from Chelsea Harbour Pier, and offer transport to Putney and Blackfriars Millennium Pier.

<text>Evald Vasilievich Ilyenkov (; 18 February 1924 – 21 March 1979) was a Russian Marxist author and Soviet philosopher.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Evald Ilyenkov was born in to the family of Soviet writer and teacher Vasily Ilyenkov. When he was four years old, the family moved to Moscow. In his youth, Evald became interested in the music of Wagner and the philosophy of Spinoza. He continued his studies at the Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History; but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War during which he fought in the Red Army as an artillery commander.

After the end of the war, he served as part of the contingent of Soviet troops in Germany until August 1945. After he was demobilized he continued his studies in the Faculty of Philosophy of the Moscow State University and joined the Communist Party in 1950.

=== Conflict at the Moscow State University ===
In April 1954, the theses &quot;On the question of the relationship between philosophy and knowledge about nature and society in the process of their historical development&quot; appeared, the authors of which were Ilyenkov and Valentin Ivanovich Korovikov. In this theses they argued that philosophy cannot solve the problems of special sciences and can only be a theory of knowledge, studying the nature and nature of scientific knowledge. In their opinion, &quot;philosophy is the science of scientific thinking, its laws and forms&quot;. In February and March 1955, at the Faculty of Philosophy of the MSU, an inspection was carried out on them by the commission of the department of science and culture of the CPSU Central Committee. In the commission&#x27;s report, the theses of Ilyenkov and Korovikov were assessed as &quot;a relapse of &quot;Menshevik idealism, which was long defeated and condemned by the party&quot;”  and It was found that “&quot;some students and graduate students have a desire to move away from pressing practical problems into the area of &quot;pure science&quot;, &quot;pure thinking&quot;, divorced from practice, from the politics of our party. Some students admitted that they had not read newspapers for a long time&quot;”. After checking the state of affairs at the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University by a commission of the CPSU Central Committee, Ilyenkov’s views were defined as &quot;a perversion of the philosophy of Marxism&quot;.

On 25 and 29 March, the Academic Council of the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University was held, at which the theses of Ilyenkov and Korovikov were discussed, as a result they were accused of Hegelianism and were deprived of the right to teach at Moscow State University.

=== Later life and career ===
In November 1953, he was accepted into the sector of dialectical materialism at the Institute of Philosophy of the USSR Academy of Sciences as a junior researcher, and in 1961 Ilyenkov received the position of senior researcher. In the first half of the 1960s, Ilyenkov participated in the creation of the Philosophical Encyclopedia as an author; in the process of working on the second volume, he became the editor of the section &quot;dialectical materialism&quot;.

From 1975 until the end of his life, Ilyenkov led a scientific seminar at the Faculty of Psychology of Moscow State University at the invitation of Dean Aleksei Leontiev.

Suffering from depression and alcoholism, Ilyenkov committed suicide on March 21, 1979. He was buried besides his father at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

== Philosophy ==
Evald Ilyenkov did original work on the materialist development of Hegel&#x27;s dialectics, notable for his account of concrete universals. His works include &quot;Dialectical Logic&quot; (Russian, 1974; English trans. 1977), &quot;Leninist Dialectics and the Metaphysics of Positivism&quot; (Russian, 1980 (posthum.); English trans. 1982) and &quot;The Dialectics of the Abstract and Concrete in Marx&#x27;s Capital&quot; (Russian, 1960; English trans. 1982).

David Bakhurst wrote in his article; &quot;Meaning, Normativity and the Life of Mind&quot;:

An abridged version of his article, &quot;Marx and the Western World,&quot; was published in English in a book of the same name in 1967, but this work is little known.

On the other hand, Ilyenkov&#x27;s work (especially his masterpiece, the study on &quot;Dialectics of the Abstract and the Concrete in Marx&#x27;s Capital&quot; from 1960, and the collection of essays entitled &quot;Dialectical Logic&quot; from 1974) deeply influenced the reception of Marx&#x27; economic writings from the 1960s onwards, in the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as well as in the West. His influence can be witnessed in the international research effort concerned with the publication of Marx&#x27; economic manuscripts (in Marx/Engels: &quot;Gesamtausgabe&quot;, or MEGA, section II, 1976 ff.). His influence is also evident in the intense debates on economic reform that was going on in the Soviet Union in the 1970s (e.g., in the works of A. K. Pokrytan).

Ilyenkov&#x27;s works have been published in about 20 languages. His &quot;Dialectical Logic&quot; (1974) was published in English by Progress Publishers in Moscow in 1977. A German translation of his &quot;Dialectics of the Abstract and the Concrete in Marx’s Capital&quot; (1960), was published by the same publisher in 1979 (and simultaneously by &quot;Das europäische Buch&quot;, West Berlin); an English translation of the book was published by Progress Publishers in Moscow in 1982. &quot;Leninist Dialectics and the Metaphysics of Positivism&quot; (first published in Russian in 1980) was published by New Park Publications in 1982.

<doc id="541344" wikidata="Q3007457" url="?curid=541344" title="Culture of Mauritius">
<text>Mauritius is a multi-ethnic, multilingual and a plural society with a population composed mainly of four major ethnic and religious groups. It is often depicted as a &quot;rainbow nation&quot;.

The island of Mauritius did not have any indigenous population and has been characterized by successive waves of European colonization and multiple immigrations. Under French rule between 1715 and 1810, slaves were imported on the island from mainland Africa and Madagascar.

Indian migrants from Pondicherry first arrived on the island in 1736. Later, massive immigration from the Bhojpuri speaking regions of India took place following the abolition of slavery in 1835 by the British Empire. After an early influx of Chinese migrants into Mauritius, mostly from Fujian, Cantonese and Hakka migrants from Southern China (Guangdong) settled on the island, first as indentured labourers and later as free merchants. Hakka Sino-Mauritians eventually became the dominant group within the community.

The co-existence of Mauritians of Indian, African (known as Mauritian Creoles), European (mostly French), and Chinese ancestry eventually led to a sharing of values and cultures, a collective participation in festivals and an increased understanding between people of different ethnic backgrounds. Mauritians from different cultural backgrounds are very distinct from each other, and it is also highly unpopular to encourage the dissolution of cultural boundaries in Mauritius. Mauritian high culture is French and Indian dominated.

== Religions ==

The Constitution of Mauritius prohibits discrimination based on creed and provides for the right of individuals to change, manifest, and propagate their religious beliefs. The government of Mauritius recognizes 6 groups as religions: Hindus, Roman Catholics, Muslims, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and Seventh-day Adventists; other religious groups must register as associations.

The people of Indian descent (Indo-Mauritian) follow mostly Hinduism and Islam. The Franco-Mauritians, Creoles and Sino-Mauritians follow Christianity. Hinduism is the major religion, followed by Christianity (with Catholicism as the largest Christian denomination), followed by Islam and some form of Chinese-related religions; a very small number of people follow Buddhism.

A majority of Sino-Mauritians identify as Catholic Christians. However, Sino-Mauritians also follow some form of Chinese-related religions (which include Taoist and Chinese Folk religions). A minority of Sino-Mauritians follow Buddhism; they also follow Confucianism. Guan Di (Kwan Tee; the god of wealth, also the god of war and the righteous and the benefactor) is an important deity for Sino-Mauritians, especially for those working in the business field. In Chinese pagodas, altars can also be found for Guan Yin, the Goddess Mazu (also known as Tin Hao; the protector of sailors), the God Choy Sun (the God of Good Fortune). Pagodas also shelter ancestral cult altars and ancestral tablets. Following Chinese tradition, religious services are typically conducted one week after death at the pagoda and the ancestral tablet of the deceased with his name written in Chinese characters is deposited behind the altar. On Chinese New Year, descendants of the deceased can practice the ancestral rites before the ancestral tablets as a sign of respect.

== Public holidays and festivals ==

=== Celebrated Festivals with public holidays ===
The number and diversity of public holidays and festivals indicate the rich heritage of the island&#x27;s people and its ethnic diversity.

Public Holidays on the same dates:

Public Holidays with different dates:

The festivals listed below are not celebrated on the same date every year. Therefore, only the months when they are likely to be celebrated is given:
=== Major events without public holidays ===
== Clothing of Mauritius ==
Fashion in Mauritius is also influenced by the vague formality-related rules, personal preference, difference between urban and rural lifestyle, and by the diverse origins of the Mauritian population, including ethno-religious identity. Mauritius of all background wears bright colours, especially Mauritian women. Flip-flops (locally known as &#x27;savat&#x27;) are worn by all Mauritian regardless of their cultural background, which are suitable for the Mauritian climate. Beachwear and tight/revealing clothing is acceptable in many resorts but they are not considered appropriate in towns and villages. Both Western-style clothing and Traditional ethnic clothing are worn in Mauritius.

==Cuisine==
The cuisine of Mauritius is a blend of African, French and other European cuisines, as well as Chinese, and Indian influences. It is common for a combination of cuisines to form part of the same meal.

Beef and pork are not commonly found in restaurants given dietary restrictions of Hindus and Muslims.

Mauritius has had strong ties with French culture throughout its history and was left with a very French &quot;savoir vivre&quot;. Even today, the popularity of French dishes like the bouillon, tuna salad, daube, civet de lièvre or coq au vin served with good wine show the prevalence of French culture in Mauritius. As the years passed by, some have been adapted to the more exotic ingredients of the island to confer some unique flavour.

During the 19th century, after the abolition of slavery, Indian workers who migrated to Mauritius brought their cuisine with them. Those indentured labourers came from different parts of India, each with their own culinary tradition, depending on the region. Traces of both northern and southern Indian cuisine can be found in Mauritius. Some common preparations are curry, chutney, &quot;rougaille poisson sale&quot; (tomato paste that is very popular with fish) and pickles, most of which use local ingredients. The Mauritian versions of those dishes have a local flavour and differ, at times considerably, from the original Indian recipes.
The end of the 19th century saw the arrival of Chinese migrants, who came mostly from the south-eastern part of China. They are largely credited with making rice, the staple diet of the island, and making noodles, both steamed and fried, popular. Chinese appetizers such as &quot;taken&quot; (local version of the spring roll with a flour batter replacing the traditional rolled wrapping), crispy chicken and crispy squid have become part of the Mauritian folklore. Furthermore, Chinese and other Asian restaurants are present all around the island, and offer a variety of chicken, squid, mutton and fish dishes, most typically prepared in black bean sauce or oyster sauce. Mauritian families often consider dinner at an Asian restaurant a treat.

Along the years, each of the country&#x27;s communities has adapted and mixed each other&#x27;s cuisine to their liking.

The production of rum is common throughout the island. Sugar cane was first introduced on the island when the Dutch colonised it in 1638. Even then, the propensity of making rum out of sugar cane was strongly recognised. Sugar cane was mainly cultivated for the production of &quot;arrack&quot;, a precursor to rum. Only much later, after almost 60 years, was the first proper sugar produced.

However, it was during the French and English administration that sugar production was fully exploited, which considerably contributed to the economic development of the island. It was Pierre Charles François Harel who in 1850 initially proposed the concept of a local distillation of rum in Mauritius. In part due to his efforts, Mauritius today houses three distilleries (Grays, Medine and St Aubin) and is in the process of opening an additional three.

While not as famed as its Caribbean counterparts from Cuba, Jamaica or Barbados, Mauritian rum is slowly gaining exposure on the international stage and is considered by local stakeholders as an area of potential growth.

==Language and Literature==

=== Language ===

Currently, the official language of Mauritius is English language. The British colonial legacy in Mauritius is reflected in the use of English language in governmental documents and communications; however, English is rarely used in public life and in daily conversation. Mauritians working in the tourism industry are however fluent in English; English is also taught in school and is the working language of government and businesses.

French is the ancestral language of the Franco-Mauritians. The presence of French settlers left an important mark on the ethnic composition of Mauritius in the form of the Franco-Mauritians; despite being a minority group, the Franco-Mauritians strongly affected the rest of the population through the use of the French language. As the French language was associated with high culture in Mauritius, the educated and the business class commonly spoke French. Nowadays, business and social aspects of life, as well as in the media (including daily newspapers), literature and many cultural expressions in Mauritius, are, however, dominated by French language. Most Mauritians are more comfortable speaking French than English, and is used by all ethnic groups.

Mauritian Creole evolved from the pidgin used by the French slave masters of the 18th century to communicate with their slaves and incorporated words from African and Malagasy dialects. Mauritian Creole is understood and spoken by all Mauritians regardless of ethnic background.Mauritian Creole was initially not taught at school due to what was considered &#x27;a lack of prestige&#x27; due to its association with the local Creole population and was perceived as a form of &#x27;broken French&#x27;. It is only in January 2012 that Mauritian Creole was officially introduced in the &quot;National Curriculum Framework&quot; and became an optional language subject for primary school students.

Most ethnic groups in Mauritius have an ancestral language. Due the presence of Mauritians of Indian and Chinese descent, Asian languages, which include Bhojpuri, Hindi, Mandarin, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu, are commonly spoken. Most of these languages act as significant religious and ethnic identity markers. Oriental languages are taught at schools, and the ethnic background of a student predominately influences his choice of oriental language.

=== Literature ===

While &quot;kreol morisien&quot; (Mauritian Creole) is the most spoken language on in Mauritius, most of the literature is written in French, although many authors write in English, Bhojpuri, and Morisien (Mauritian Creole), and others such as Abhimanyu Unnuth in Hindi. Mauritius&#x27;s renowned playwright Dev Virahsawmy writes exclusively in Morisyen.

Important authors include Eugénie Poujade, Malcolm de Chazal, Ananda Devi, Raymond Chasle, Loys Masson, Marcel Cabon, and Edouard Maunick. Lindsey Collen has been able to carve out a meeting of imaginaries in the unique social setup of this multi-faceted country. Other younger writers like Shenaz Patel, Amal Sewtohul, Natacha Appanah, Alain Gordon-Gentil and Carl de Souza explore the issues of ethnicity, superstition and politics in the novel. Poet and critic Khal Torabully has put forward the concept of &quot;coolitude&quot;, a poetics that results from the blend of Indian and Mauritian cultural diversity. Other poets include Hassam Wachill, Edouard Maunick, Sedley Assone, Yusuf Kadel and Umar Timol.

The island plays host to the coveted Le Prince Maurice Prize, a literary award celebrating and recognizing &#x27;writers of the heart&#x27;. The award is designed to highlight the literary love story in all its forms rather than for pure Romantic Fiction. In keeping with the island&#x27;s literary culture the prize alternates on a yearly basis between English-speaking and French-speaking writers.

== Legends and folklore stories ==
Many people in Mauritius, in particular those living in rural areas, believe in witchcraft and paranormal activities; this is very likely to be the combination of African, Malagasy, Indian, Chinese and European folk traditions.

=== Calèche de Lallmatie ===
Calèche de Lallmatie (lit. &quot;Chariot of Lallmatie&quot; in English) is a Mauritian legend around the village of Lallmatie which says that two women dressed in white riding two white horses were seen at night, close to midnight. The legend appeared some years prior to the appearance of &quot;Touni Mniwi&quot; phenomenon.

=== Lougarou ===
Lougarou (lit. &quot;werewolf&quot; in English; from the French term &quot;Loup garou&quot;) is a notorious figure which appears in Mauritian folklore, which is mostly used to scare children; its appearance may result from the combination of French and African folklore stories. The Lougarou appears at full moon and brings trouble to the local population. Protection against the Lougarou is believed to be given if a person consults a &quot;longanis&quot; (i.e. a local sorcerer) or a &quot;treter&quot; (i.e. witch doctor).

==== Touni Minwi ====
The legend of &quot;Touni Minwi&quot; (lit. &quot;Naked at Midnight&quot;) appeared in 1994 following Cyclone Hollanda; the cyclone had led to the destruction of many houses and electricity shortages. Touni Minwi was supposedly a form of Lougarou, who would visit women in their homes at night. This led to hysteria among the local population; many witnesses would affirm having seen frightful manifestations at night time, including apparitions of Lougarou. The Touni Minwi phenomenon led to a large mobilization of people in the capital, Port Louis, and in the village of Lallmatie.

=== Mountain-related legends or folk stories ===

==== Le Morne Brabant and the Maroons ====
According to the legend, the maroons decided to jump to their death from Le Morne Brabant when they misunderstood the presence of a group of soldiers who were supposed to inform them that they were emancipated following the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British. Fearing recapture and being returned to their former masters, they decided to commit suicide.

==== Pieter Both and the Milkman ====

Pieter Both Mountain is one of the most emblematic places in Mauritius; it is characterized by a rock which looks like a human head on its top. According to a famous local legend, a milkman from the village of Crève Coeur (which is also located at the foot of the mountain) used to sell milk in the surrounding villages. One day, the milkman decided to take a shortcut through Pieter Both to reach the next village; when walking, he felt tired and decided to rest. When he woke up, he saw fairies dancing and singing; the fairies told him not to tell anyone about what they saw or he would be turned into stone. The milkman, however, could not prevent himself and told the story to his friends. When the milkman returned to Pieter Both, the fairies knew that he did not keep the secret and turned him into stone. The head of milkman is the top of the mountain. The rock, which is perched on the tip of Pieter Both, is therefore believed to be the milkman.

=== World Heritage Sites ===

==== Aapravasi Ghat ====

The Aapravasi Ghat is found in the bay of Trou Fanfaron in Port Louis; it is the place where indentured Indian labour system started. In 1834, following the emancipation of slaves, the British used Mauritius as their first site to experiment the use of contracted &#x27;free (indentured) labour&#x27; from the poorest parts of India to replace the use of slaves. The Aapravasi Ghat is the remnants of an immigration depot built in 1849 to receive the influx of indentured labourers coming from India, Eastern Africa, Madagascar, China and Southeast Asia to start a new life of work on the sugar plantations. The Aapravasi Ghat site is owned by the Ministry of Arts and Culture. The property is protected as National Heritage under the National Heritage Fund Act 2003 and the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund Act 2001. It was listed in the World Heritage List in 2006.

==== Le Morne Cultural Landscape ====
Le Morne Brabant is found in the southwest of Mauritius; it used to shelter escaped slaves, called maroons, throughout the 18th to 19th centuries. The Mauritian oral traditions associated with the maroons have made Le Morne a symbol of the slaves’ fight for freedom, their suffering, and their sacrifice. It was listed in the World Heritage List in 2008. The &quot;International Slave Route Monument&quot;, located at the foot of Le Morne Brabant, was established in 2009 due to its association with a historical and legendary place, called the &#x27;Valley of Bones&#x27;. According to the legend, the maroons decided to jump to their death from Le Morne Brabant when they misunderstood the presence of a group of soldiers who were supposed to inform them that they were emancipated following the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British. Fearing to be recaptured and be returned to their former masters, they decided to commit suicide.

=== Chinese Cultural Landmarks ===

==== Chinatown of Mauritius, Port Louis ====
The Chinatown of Mauritius is situated in Port Louis. The Chinatown emerged in a city which is marked by the strong racial segregation of the 18th century. A small Chinatown was already forming in Port Louis in the mid-1780s, and in the mid-1840s, Port Louis market was dominated by Chinese traders. The Chinatown was also divided by the Cantonese and the Hakka who showed hostility towards each other. Port Louis Chinatown was originally developed around the shops of Fujianese and Cantonese immigrants in the north of Royal Road and was further expanded in the 20th century. The Cantonese established their own neighbourhood at Royal Road and extended along Arsenal Road to La Rampe Road; they opened shops, restaurants, Kwongs (societies) and religious associations, which include the &quot;Chan Cha&quot; (founded prior to 1874). Between the 1910s and 1920s, Hakka commerce started to extend beyond the limits of the Old China Town along Royal Road; Hakka business would later expand to the South of Royal Road.In the 1940s, there was an influx of Chinese immigrants who arrived in Mauritius to open more businesses, and decided to settle around Royal Road in the heart of Port Louis, further developing what is currently known as the Mauritian Chinatown. 

The Chinatown also houses the &quot;Heritage Court&quot;, which is the headquarters of the Namshun Society (also known as the Nam Shun Fooy Kwoon (南顺会馆)). The Namshun Society was initiated by early Cantonese migrants from Nanhai and Shunde (who became known as &quot;Nam Shun&quot; (南顺) in Mauritius) since 1859, when the early migrants formed an informal association of mutual help; it was officially registered on 26 June 1894. The founding father of the Namshun society was Affan Tank Wen.

In 2018, the New Chinatown Foundation was established with the common goal of reviving the Chinatown, as well as restoring and preserving its cultural heritage.

==== Chinese Pagodas ====
Chinese pagodas throughout Mauritius are important sites for Sino-Mauritians as these are where traditional ceremonies and festivals take place. It was common practice for Chinese migrants to donate money to the pagodas which they frequently go to.Cantonese clan groupings also set up their own pagodas. Cantonese pagodas included Chan Cha Pagoda (found at Arsenal Road), Tiong Fa Pagoda (found on La Rampe Road), Fok Diak Pagoda (found at Rémy Ollier Road and built in 1846), and Sweet-Hang Pagoda (found on David Road). Nam Shun Fooy Kwoon has pagodas which are located next to the Champs de Mars in Port Louis, consisting of the Kwang Tee (Guan Di) Pagoda (first built in 1895, a new building was inaugurated in November 1980), where a shrine for the dead (jiu sin sun wai) for the Cantonese community is found to allow the souls of the deceased to rest, and the Tin Hao (Mazu) Pagoda; they also have an altar for the God of Good Fortune, Choy Sun.

===== Kwan Tee Pagoda, Port Louis =====

The Kwan Tee Pagoda (or Guan Di Pagoda) is located at Les Salines, Port Louis; it is the oldest pagoda in the Southern Hemisphere and in Mauritius. Its location and construction follow the Chinese principles of spirituality by facing the sea and being against the mountains. It was built in 1842 by Hahime Choisanne and his followers. The Cohan Tai Biou Society (which existed since 1819 and was founded by Log Choisanne) is responsible for the administration of the Kwan Tee Pagoda. Guan Di is an important deity for Sino-Mauritians, especially for people who have businesses. The cult of Guan Di is associated with the god of wealth; Guan Di is also the god of war and of the righteous and of the benefactor. Inside the pagoda, there is the altar of Mazu, who is a protector of sailors, and Guan Yin. There is also an ancestor cult altar, with the oldest tablet dating around 1841. Following Chinese tradition, religious services are typically conducted one week after death at the pagoda and the ancestral tablet of the deceased with his name written in Chinese characters is deposited behind the altar. On Chinese New Year, descendants of the deceased can practice the ancestral rites before the ancestral tablets as a sign of respect. The Kwan Tee Pagoda has also been listed in the National Heritage List since 2016.

== Music and Dance of Mauritius ==

Music found in Mauritius has the sounds and rhythms of Western, Eastern, and African civilizations which result from the preserved legacy transmitted by the ancestors of the Mauritians to their descendants. Traditional dances and music were introduced by Indian and Chinese migrants to Mauritius. The most well-known Traditional Chinese dance in Mauritius is the Dragon dance and the Lion dance. Western music and dance are also well represented in Mauritius, where rap, hip-hop, Jazz, and waltz (along with all types of ballroom dancing) can be found. There is also a strong following of oldies music, dating from 1960s and 1970s; performers such as Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, and Engelbert Humperdinck are part of the national musical heritage.

Some sounds and rhythms from various ethnic backgrounds have also merged to form unique forms of rhythm and sound. The most typical folkloric dance is the Sega, which is of African origin; the Sega was originally danced and sung by slaves before being adopted by all Mauritians. Seggae (a form of music which results from the mixture of the Sega and reggae) emerged in the 1980s, reflecting the mixed cultural aspect of Mauritius.

== National Symbols ==

== Sport ==
Due to lack of funding and a local culture that values academic achievement over any other form of activity, Mauritius&#x27; national sports teams have been very unsuccessful at a competitive level. However recently, rugby union has rapidly increased in popularity in the small island nation. Football is also popular. Both national teams have very low world rankings for their particular sports.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Mauritius had won its first Olympic medal. Bruno Julie, a boxer, won the bronze medal.

However, Mauritius is quite competitive at the regional level (Inter-Ile) in the Indian Ocean. Mauritius has collected some gold, silver and bronze medals at the Jeux des Iles de l&#x27;Océan Indien (JIOI). The second and the fifth editions were hosted by Mauritius in 1985 and 2003 respectively. Mauritius also organised the JIOI in 2019, where the Mauritian athletes dominated the games and won numerous gold medals and the competition.

As in countries like Malaysia, football is hugely popular among males, especially England&#x27;s Premier League. The most followed clubs are Liverpool F.C., Manchester United and Arsenal F.C. Owing to their recent successes, FC Barcelona have gained significant support.

The national sport, however, remains horse racing, which is part and parcel of the island&#x27;s cultural heritage. Horse racing in Mauritius dates back to 1812, when the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated, making it the oldest racecourse in the Southern Hemisphere. Races are widely followed, both in terms of attendance at the Champ de Mars and viewership by television audiences. Mauritians of all ages like to discuss races, share tips and place bets.

At an amateur and recreational level, there is a growing culture of participation in sport, with trail running, cycling, mountain biking and water sports becoming increasingly accessible and popular.

<text>Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov (, ; born 21 March 1950) is a Russian diplomat who has served as the foreign minister of Russia since 2004. He is the longest-serving Russian foreign minister since Andrei Gromyko during the Soviet Union.

Lavrov was born in Moscow and graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) in 1972. He received his first Soviet diplomatic posting in Sri Lanka, and speaks fluent Sinhala, Dhivehi, English, and French, in addition to his native Russian. From 1981 to 1988 Lavrov held several posts in the Soviet Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York City. Starting in the late 1980s he was deputy director and then director of the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s Department of International Organizations before becoming a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1992. Lavrov was the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations from 1994 to 2004. His tenure in that role coincided with several crises, namely the Kosovo War and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Lavrov gained a reputation for assertively defending Russia&#x27;s foreign policy interests and was considered to be the most influential member of the UN Security Council. He was made the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs in March 2004.

==Early life and education==
Lavrov was born on 21 March 1950 in Moscow, to an Armenian father from Tbilisi, Georgian SSR, and a Russian mother from Noginsk, Russian SFSR. His father&#x27;s surname was originally Kalantaryan. His mother worked in the Soviet Ministry for Foreign Trade. Lavrov graduated from high school with a silver medal. Since his favorite class was physics, he planned to enter either the National Research Nuclear University or the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, but he entered the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and graduated in 1972.

During his education at the MGIMO, Lavrov studied international relations. Soon he learned Sinhalese, then the only official language of Sri Lanka, as well as Dhivehi, the official language of the Maldives. He also learned English and French. After he was admitted to the university, Lavrov, along with other students, was sent for a month to a student construction brigade building the Ostankino Tower.

During his summer vacations, Lavrov also worked in his university&#x27;s student construction brigades in Khakassia, Tuva and the Russian Far East. Each semester, Lavrov with his fellow students conducted drama performances, which were later presented on the main stage of the university. During the third year of his studies, Lavrov was married.

==Career==

=== Soviet diplomat in Sri Lanka (1972–1975) ===
Lavrov graduated in 1972. According to the rules of that time, a graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations had to work for the Foreign Ministry for a certain amount of time. Lavrov was employed in the Soviet embassy in Sri Lanka as an advisor, as he was already a specialist on the country. At the time, the Soviet Union and Sri Lanka had close market and economic cooperation and the Soviet Union launched the production of natural rubber in the country.

The Soviet embassy in Sri Lanka also maintained relations with the Maldives. The embassy in Sri Lanka employed only 24 diplomats. Lavrov was given the task of continuously analysing the situation in the country, but he also worked as a translator, personal secretary and assistant to Rafiq Nishonov, who would later become the 12th First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbek SSR. In addition, he gained the diplomatic rank of an attaché.

=== USSR Section for International Economic Relations and the UN ===
In 1976, Lavrov returned to Moscow. He worked as a third and second secretary in the Section for International Economic Relations of the USSR. There, he was involved in analytics and his office also worked with various international organizations, including the United Nations.

In 1981, he was sent as a senior adviser to the Soviet mission to the United Nations in New York City.

In 1988, Lavrov returned to Moscow and was named Deputy Chief of the Section for International Economic Relations of the USSR. Between 1990 and 1992 he worked as Director of the International Organization of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

===Soviet-to-CIS transition (1992–1994)===
In October 1991, Andrey Kozyrev, who was in charge of monitoring international organizations at the time, was named Foreign Minister of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). In that year, the powers of the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of the Russian SFSR were distributed. Until then the Russian SFSR had only a ceremonial role. In October 1992, the foreign ministers of all Soviet republics, except Georgia and the Baltic states, held a meeting where they dealt with the Union of Foreign Ministries.

In November 1991, the State Council decided to change its name from the Union of Foreign Ministries to the Foreign Ministry of the Soviet Union. In April 1992, he was named deputy foreign minister.

In December 1991, the Foreign Ministry of Soviet Russia became the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation.

In 1992, Lavrov was named director of the Department for International Organizations and Global Issues in the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation.

Lavrov was asked to oversee the activities of the Human Rights and International Cultural Cooperation and the two departments – for the CIS countries, international organizations and international economic cooperation.

Lavrov was promoted to the diplomatic rank of the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary — the highest diplomatic rank in the Russian Federation — by the Decree of the then President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, on 5 June 1992 No. 568.

===Russian Permanent Representative to the UN (1994–2004)===
Lavrov worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs until 1994 when he returned to work in the United Nations, this time as the Permanent Representative of Russia. While in the latter position, he was the President of the United Nations Security Council in December 1995, June 1997, July 1998, October 1999, December 2000, April 2002, and June 2003.

===Foreign minister of Russia (2004–&quot;present&quot;)===


On 9 March 2004, President Vladimir Putin appointed Lavrov to the post of minister of foreign affairs. He succeeded Igor Ivanov in the post.

Lavrov held on to his position through Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Second Cabinet while Dmitri Medvedev occupied the presidency from 2008 to 2012.

On 21 May 2012, Lavrov was reappointed foreign minister to the cabinet led by prime minister Dimitri Medvedev.

Lavrov is regarded as continuing in the style of his predecessor: a brilliant diplomat but a civil servant rather than a politician. A Russian foreign policy expert at London&#x27;s Chatham House has described him as &quot;a tough, reliable, extremely sophisticated negotiator&quot; but adds that &quot;he&#x27;s not part of Putin&#x27;s inner sanctum&quot; and that the toughening of Russian foreign policy has got very little to do with him.

US politicians have been much more critical in their appraisal of Lavrov, seeing him as emblematic of President Putin&#x27;s resurgent violent foreign policies. Then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found that Lavrov treated her poorly during negotiations, like a &quot;jerk.&quot; Several Obama administration officials interviewed for a profile on Lavrov described him as an “anti-diplomat” with “nothing redeemable” about his “uncharismatic, offensive, uncompromising, cruel, unlikeable, brusque, caddish” character.

On 15 January 2020, he resigned as part of the cabinet, after President Vladimir Putin delivered the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly, in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution. On 21 January 2020, he maintained his position in Mikhail Mishustin&#x27;s Cabinet.

====Civil war in Syria====
In 2012, in the early stages of the Syrian Civil War, a Russian delegation travelled to Syria to affirm Russia&#x27;s backing of the Syrian government of the President Bashar al-Assad. Lavrov and Mikhail Fradkov, who were part of the delegation, were given a favorable welcome by thousands of pro-Assad supporters. The supporters waved Russian flags in thanks to Russia&#x27;s veto of a UN resolution calling for tough sanctions on the Syrian government.

In September 2013, then Secretary of State John Kerry and Lavrov reached a breakthrough agreement that would destroy almost all chemical weapons stored in Assad&#x27;s Syria. The deal was reached after three challenging rounds of talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Soon after, Syria fully accepted this plan, and by June 2014 all chemical weapons submitted by the Syrian government were safely incinerated in the Eastern Mediterranean. The director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons at the United Nations declared that this treaty was a major benchmark.

In October 2019, Lavrov condemned Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to send American troops to guard Syria&#x27;s oil fields and possibly exploit them, saying that any &quot;exploitation of natural resources of a sovereign state without its consent is illegal&quot;.

Amid the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and subsequent fall of Damascus, Lavrov was reported to have led efforts to facilitate the departure of president Assad by negotiating with Turkey and Qatar to persuade Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham to let Assad leave Syria.

====Russian-Ukrainian conflict 2014====


After the March 2014 Crimean status referendum, Lavrov proposed that Ukraine should be independent of any bloc, that the Russian language be recognised officially, and that the constitution be organised along federal lines. In an interview with the Russia-24 TV channel, Lavrov said that the zero-sum &quot;either-or&quot; bloc-politics of Ukraine were first suggested in 2004 by Karel De Gucht, then Foreign Minister of Belgium.

When G8 leaders voted to officially suspend Russia&#x27;s membership on 24 March, Lavrov stated that the G8 was an informal organization and membership was optional for Russia.

In a 30 March interview, he spoke of the 21 February agreement which was signed by Viktor Yanukovich, Vitaly Klitchko, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, and Oleg Tyagnibok as well as the Foreign Ministers of Poland, France and Germany to promote peaceful changes in Ukrainian power. Lavrov stressed federalism as a solution to the constitutional impasse in Ukraine, and deplored the de-officialisation of the Russian language. He noticed the work of the secretariat of the Council of Europe at the Venice Commission to prevent a legitimation of the Crimean referendum, and to expel Russia. Lavrov was &quot;taken aback&quot; when US President Barack Obama called Russia a &quot;regional power&quot;. He deplored the misuse of the Schengen Agreement to force Crimeans to visit Kyiv in order to gain a Schengen visa, and noticed that the E.U. proposes a visa-free regime for Ukrainian citizens. Lavrov stated that the Revolution of Dignity in Kyiv and the results of the Crimean referendum should both be accepted equally by the West. He reiterated the three-part Russian proposal for the progress of Ukraine:
# Constitutional federalism
# Recognition of linguistic minorities
# That Ukraine be a non-aligned state

The Kyiv government on 30 March denounced Lavrov&#x27;s proposals as amounting to &quot;the complete capitulation of Ukraine, its dismemberment, and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.

While Lavrov acknowledged that Russia is in contact with the Ukrainian separatist rebels he denied US and EU allegations that Moscow sponsored the rebellion and accused the United States of aggravating the conflict. &quot;Our American colleagues still prefer to push the Ukrainian leadership toward a confrontational path.&quot; He added that chances for settling the Russo-Ukrainian war would have been higher if it only depended on Russia and Europe. Lavrov said the separatists want to &quot;defend their culture, their traditions, celebrate their holidays rather than anniversaries of Roman Shukhevych and Stepan Bandera.&quot;

In June 2016, Lavrov stated that Russia will never attack any NATO country, saying: &quot;I am convinced that all serious and honest politicians know perfectly well than Russia will never attack a member state of NATO. We have no such plans.&quot; He also said: &quot;In our security doctrine it is clearly stated that one of the main threats to our safety is the further expansion of NATO to the east.&quot;

==== 2017 North Korea crisis ====
Lavrov likened the war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to a kindergarten fight between two children, saying &quot;Together with China we&#x27;ll continue to strive for a reasonable approach and not an emotional one like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them.&quot;

Lavrov also said that the United States would not carry out a strike on North Korea because &quot;they know for sure – rather than suspect – that it has atomic bombs.&quot; He said the US invaded Iraq &quot;solely because they had 100 percent information that there were no weapons of mass destruction left there.&quot;

==== US sanctions ====
Lavrov criticized US sanctions against countries like Iran, Turkey and Russia. In August 2018, Lavrov said, &quot;unilateral enforcement measures are illegitimate in international affairs&quot; [...]. &quot;One way to counter these illegitimate barriers and restrictions is we can use national currencies on our bilateral trade&quot;. &quot;I strongly believe that abuse of the role the U.S. dollar plays as an international currency will eventually result in its role being undermined&quot;.

Businesses involved in Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been sanctioned by the United States with the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 on 20 December 2019. Lavrov said that US Congress &quot;is literally overwhelmed with the desire to do everything to destroy&quot; the Russia–United States relations.

==== Ukraine&#x27;s education law ====
Lavrov condemned Ukraine&#x27;s 2017 education law, which makes Ukrainian the only language of education in state schools. According to Lavrov, the &quot;reaction of Brussels to the Ukrainian Law on Education is utterly vague although it crudely violates Kyiv&#x27;s commitments on linguistic and educational rights.&quot; Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry stated that the law is designed to &quot;forcefully establish a mono-ethnic language regime in a multinational state.&quot;

==== Non-citizens in Latvia and Estonia ====
As early as 2011 Lavrov criticized the status of &quot;non-citizens&quot; in Latvia and Estonia, calling the problem of Russian speaking stateless persons &quot;shameful for the EU.&quot;

==== NATO&#x27;s Defender-Europe 2021 ====
In 2021, Lavrov was critical of a massive NATO-led military exercise called Defender-Europe 21, one of the largest NATO-led military exercises in Europe in decades, which began in March 2021. It included &quot;nearly simultaneous operations across more than 30 training areas&quot; in Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania and other countries. He said that Russia&#x27;s response was inevitable.

==== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====
In January 2022, the United States accused Russia of sending saboteurs into Ukraine to stage &quot;a false-flag operation&quot; that would create a pretext for Russia to invade Ukraine. Lavrov dismissed the US claim as &quot;total disinformation&quot;. On 4 February 2022, Lavrov dismissed as &quot;nonsense&quot; and &quot;craziness&quot; allegations by the United States that Russia was preparing a fake video of the Ukrainian forces attacking the separatist-held Donbas as a pretext for starting a war in Ukraine. On 10 February 2022, Lavrov met with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. In the context of tensions between Russia and the West over a build up of Russian troops near the Russia–Ukraine border talks between the two foreign ministers were described as &quot;difficult&quot;. Lavrov denied that Russia has any plans to invade Ukraine. He described Western &quot;demands to remove Russian troops from Russian territory&quot; as &quot;regrettable&quot;.

In August 2022, &#x27;Foreign Policy&#x27; reported Western diplomats stating that Lavrov has no real influence on Russia&#x27;s foreign policy and has become a mere propagandist and mouthpiece for Putin. Regarding Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, foreign policy expert Angela Stent said: &quot;As far as we know, Lavrov himself only knew [the invasion] was happening as it was taking place.&quot; According to sources close to the Kremlin, Lavrov was informed of Putin&#x27;s plan to attack Ukraine at short notice before the invasion.

On 25 February 2022, the day after Russia began an invasion of Ukraine, Lavrov claimed that Putin ordered the invasion to &quot;free Ukrainians from oppression&quot;. The same day, the US, UK, EU and Canada announced sanctions against Lavrov as well as Putin. The US added Lavrov to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. On 26 February, Australia announced similar sanctions on Lavrov. On 1 March most diplomats at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva staged a walkout in protest at the Russian invasion of Ukraine as Lavrov began to speak to the assembly via video from Moscow. Lavrov criticized the West on some policies relating to Ukraine, denouncing his prevention on flying to Geneva due to the ban on Russian aircraft on EU airspace as &quot;Trying to avoid a candid face-to-face dialogue or direct contacts designed to help identify political solutions to pressing international issues.&quot; He was also quoted &quot;The West clearly has lost self-control in venting anger against Russia and has destroyed its own rules and institutions.&quot; Lavrov, who read from a prepared text, repeated Putin&#x27;s 23 February goal statement: &quot;The goal of our actions is to save people by fulfilling our allied obligations, as well as to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine so that such things never happen again.&quot;

On 25 February 2022, Lavrov claimed that &quot;available statistics confirm&quot; that &quot;no strikes are being made on civilian infrastructure.&quot;

On 2 March 2022, Lavrov explained in an interview with &quot;Al Jazeera&quot;, Moscow, how the invasion of Ukraine came about in the context of an international crisis that already existed well before 2014. According to him, Russia had to annex the Crimea in 2014 due to the unacceptable risk that NATO naval bases would replace the Russian military port there. He primarily contests the legitimacy of the putsch against Viktor Yanukovych, who according to the Russian leadership already initiated &quot;peace&quot; in Ukraine, with respect to all Russian speaking minorities. He accuses the West of not supporting the special status of those minorities, before Yanukovych was deposed by the Orange Revolution in 2004–2005. He continued that Zelenskyy did not improve the situation any further, and that Putin had to order the invasion of Ukraine, because the US did not comply or even address the security concerns of Russia&#x27;s western flank. Lavrov claimed the US exerted similar pressures on Iraq in 2003, which the US invaded later for no reason other than &quot;a vial of unidentified chemicals&quot;. At the same time, Lavrov tries to portray the current Ukrainian government as &quot;nationalistic&quot; and &quot;right wing&quot; because it does not incorporate historical and linguistic ties to Russia into national policies, and only excels to separate itself from a shared history and culture.

On 10 March 2022, Lavrov met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Antalya, Turkey. Lavrov claimed that Russia &quot;did not attack Ukraine&quot;. He said without evidence that the Russian military bombed the maternity hospital in Mariupol because it was a base for the Azov Battalion.

On 28 March 2022, he praised the relations between Russia and China as the best in history. On 1 April 2022, he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that Russia &quot;appreciates&quot; India&#x27;s neutral position on the war in Ukraine.

On 7 April 2022, the United Nations General Assembly in New York voted to suspend Russia from the UNHRC over its behaviour in Ukraine: &quot;93 members voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke while 24 were against and 58 abstained. This met the required threshold of a two-thirds majority of the assembly members that vote yes or no, with abstentions not counting in the calculation.&quot; Linda Thomas-Greenfield had spearheaded the effort and Dmytro Kuleba thought it appropriate and published his thanks while UK Ambassador James Roscoe observed of the Putin administration who tried to quit the body after the fact that it sounded &quot;like someone that&#x27;s just been fired tendering their resignation.&quot; On 25 April, Lavrov accused NATO of fighting a proxy war with Russia that could escalate into a global conflict with nuclear weapons. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that &quot;it&#x27;s unhelpful and dangerous to rattle sabers and speculate about the use of nuclear weapons.&quot;

On 1 May 2022, in an interview with the Italian television broadcaster Rete 4, Lavrov was asked why Russia claimed it needed to &quot;denazify&quot; Ukraine, considering the Ukrainian president himself, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish. Lavrov responded by suggesting that Adolf Hitler, like Zelenskyy, had Jewish heritage, saying &quot;as to [Zelenskyy&#x27;s] argument of what kind of nazification can we have if I&#x27;m Jewish, if I remember correctly, and I may be wrong, Hitler also had Jewish blood.&quot; Lavrov elaborated &quot;for some time we have heard from the Jewish people that the biggest antisemites were Jewish.&quot; Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett condemned Lavrov&#x27;s comments and said that &quot;using the Holocaust of the Jewish people as a political tool must cease immediately&quot;. On 5 May, Bennett&#x27;s office issued a statement saying: &quot;The Prime Minister accepted President Putin&#x27;s apology for Lavrov&#x27;s remarks and thanked him for clarifying his attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust&quot;. Lavrov was criticized by Deborah Lipstadt for the remarks.

On 14 May 2022, Lavrov used the phrase &quot;total hybrid war&quot; in the course of describing the West&#x27;s efforts to help Ukraine combat the 2022 Russian invasion.

On 6 June 2022, according to &quot;Večernje novosti&quot;, Sergey Lavrov was due to visit the Serbian capital, Belgrade. However the countries of Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Montenegro, which surround Serbia, refused Lavrov permission to use their airspace, which led to the cancellation of the visit.

On 16 June 2022, in an interview with the BBC&#x27;s Steve Rosenberg, Lavrov stated that Russia did not invade Ukraine, but instead &quot;declared a special military operation because we had absolutely no other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a criminal act.&quot; He again repeated the Kremlin&#x27;s claim that there were Nazis in Ukraine. Lavrov was also asked about a report by the United Nations on an incident involving the Russian military in Yahidne, Ukraine. Lavrov replied: &quot;It&#x27;s a great pity but international diplomats, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Secretary-General and other UN representatives, are being put under pressure by the West. And very often they&#x27;re being used to amplify fake news spread by the West. Russia is not squeaky clean. Russia is what it is. And we are not ashamed of showing who we are.&quot;

On 8 July 2022, Lavrov left the G20 summit of foreign ministers in Bali, Indonesia because he disliked the questions about the invasion of Ukraine. He left when German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock began her formal address. Ukraine sympathizers refused to join a group photo with Lavrov, who seemed perplexed at the criticism.

On 20 July 2022, Lavrov publicly confirmed that Russia had as a goal not only to &quot;liberate&quot; the Donbas region, but also to occupy the Kherson region, the Zaporizhzhia region and several other territories, supposedly as a response to Ukraine receiving weapons support from abroad. On 26 July 2022, he said: &quot;We are determined to help the people of eastern Ukraine to liberate themselves from the burden of this absolutely unacceptable regime,&quot;

On 11 September 2022, Lavrov said that he has not given up on the idea of peace talks with Kyiv. According to his views, &quot;the longer this process is delayed, the harder it will be to reach an agreement.&quot; Kyiv and Moscow have held intermittent peace talks since late February 2022, sponsored by Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry.

One week before the 2022 Russian mobilization, Lavrov assured the Russians that there would be no mobilization or martial law.

On 23 September 2022, Lavrov attended the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York City, after he received permission to travel to the United States. The Russian foreign minister regretted that he was not able to attend the full presentation by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Lavrov attempted to convince the audience that &#x27;countries supplying weapons to Ukraine and training its soldiers were parties to the conflict&#x27;. He said that Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine would be under Russia&#x27;s &quot;full protection&quot; if they are annexed by Russia. Lavrov again falsely claimed that the elected government in Ukraine was illegitimately installed and filled with neo-Nazis. Ukraine&#x27;s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov&#x27;s comments about using nuclear weapons were &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;.

On 14 November, the Associated Press reported, citing Indonesia officials, that Lavrov had been admitted to hospital with a heart condition. An aide subsequently released a video on Telegram showing Lavrov laughing at such reports from his hotel in Bali, claiming Western media was at fault for &quot;some kind of game&quot;.

On 1 December, he advocated Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, saying that &quot;This infrastructure supports the combat capability of the Ukrainian armed forces&quot; and that the Russian missile attacks were intended to &quot;knock out energy facilities that allow you to keep pumping deadly weapons into Ukraine in order to kill the Russians&quot;.

On 28 December, Lavrov stated on national television: &quot;I am convinced that thanks to our perseverance, patience and determination, we will defend the noble goals that are vital for our people and our country&quot;. He also stated: &quot;Our absolute priority is four new Russian regions&quot;. He also stated that peace talks with Ukraine would only resume if it recognized the annexation of the four regions only partially occupied: &quot;They should become free from the threat of Nazification that they have faced for many years&quot;.

On 4 March 2023 the BBC reported that Lavrov was ridiculed by a conference audience after a G20 foreign ministers&#x27; meeting in Delhi after saying the Ukraine war was &quot;launched against us&quot;. Lavrov claimed Russia was trying to stop the Ukraine war, which began after its own full-scale invasion in February 2022. Video footage of the incident was also published and the laughter could be heard in the audio. However, he received applause from a section of the audience when he criticized the US-led invasion of Iraq.

On 20 March 2023, India negated personal sanctions imposed against the Russian foreign minister while he was welcomed by India&#x27;s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi. During the G-20 earlier that month, India attempted to resolve the conflict between the United States and Russia but conceded saying &#x27;the gap between the countries was too much&#x27;.

On 6 April 2023, Lavrov again visited Turkey to meet his counter-part Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. The ministers discussed several key topics including energy, security and regional diplomacy. Turkey served as a chief broker for the Black Sea Grain Initiative that opened up grain shipments from Ukraine and Russia to North Africa and the developing world. Turkey, a NATO-ally, has not imposed sanctions against Lavrov. Russia has stated that sanctions had impeded the export of Russian grain, and with the expiration of the deal, reduced Russian grain exports would accelerate inflation and food shortages. Because of intense diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Russian Federation, a new deal would allow Ukraine to export another twenty-five million tons of grain and foodstuff to underdeveloped countries. Previously Western media had accused Lavrov of obstructing Ukrainian grain shipments. On 7 April 2023, Lavrov said Russia rejects the &quot;unipolar world order&quot; led by the United States and wants any peace talks with Ukraine to focus on creating a &quot;new world order.&quot;

In May 2023, Lavrov said that Germany was supporting Ukraine because today&#x27;s German leaders inherited &quot;Nazi genes&quot;.
In January 2024 Lavrov was quoted as saying: &quot;Where has there been a similar turn of events before? Afghanistan. The Americans spent twenty years there. Did that period last as long as they needed or as long as it was possible? What did they accomplish there? .. Ukraine, unfortunately is doomed to the same fate, because while relying on the patron, staying unaware that the patron cares only about himself, not about you at all, you cannot expect that the interests of your people will somehow be taken into account.&quot;

On 15 February 2024 he had a telephone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, the first contact between Russia and the U.S. at that level in almost two years. They discussed organizing initial Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, ending economic and diplomatic restrictions imposed on Russia during the previous several years, and various other issues, including the Gaza war and the Middle East situation.

Lavrov and presidential foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov participated in talks with the U.S. delegation led by Rubio in Saudi Arabia on 18 February 2025. The Saudi foreign minister and national security advisor were also involved. The result of their talks was an agreement to begin negotiations to end the Russo-Ukrainian War and to work towards normalizing relations between the U.S. and Russia.

====Miscellaneous other business====

In July 2022, Lavrov visited Egypt, Congo, Uganda and Ethiopia and praised the neutral position taken by African countries towards the war in Ukraine. On 6 July 2022, he met with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bùi Thanh Sơn in Hanoi and called Vietnam a &quot;key partner&quot; of Russia in ASEAN. On 28 July 2022, Lavrov attended the meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). He met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and praised the &quot;traditional friendship&quot; between Russia and China. He described Myanmar as a &quot;friendly and longstanding partner&quot;.

On 2 September 2022, Lavrov was concerned over the delay in obtaining US visas for himself and his staff for the yearly meeting of world leaders at the UNGA on 19 September. &quot;Not a single member of the 56-member Russian advance team and delegation&quot; had received the visas. The US protested that this was due to the expulsion of staff from its Moscow embassy. Lavrov backed India and Brazil for permanent membership at the UN Security Council.

On 23–26 January 2023, Lavrov visited South Africa, Swaziland, Angola, and Eritrea. On 5–9 February, he visited Iraq, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan. South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor thanked Lavrov for the &quot;most wonderful meeting&quot; and described Russia as a &quot;valued partner&quot;. On 10 February, Lavrov said that Western efforts to &quot;isolate&quot; Russia had completely failed, and that Russia was building stronger relations with countries in Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.

On 19 April 2023, Lavrov started his official tour to South and Central America as well as Cuba. His mission to these countries was initiated by a meeting with the newly elected Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who announced his position to negotiate in the conflict and to lay partial blame on Ukraine for the war. Lavrov had welcomed the balanced position by Brazil. He continued the tour a day later to visit Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, a staunch Russian ally. Later that week, Lavrov also paid visits to Cuba and finally Nicaragua. His encounters with politicians there were taking place in friendly manner, and highlight the economic and political alliances Russia has with those nations.

In June 2023, Lavrov took part in a BRICS Foreign Ministers Meeting in Cape Town chaired by South Africa. He met with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, who was also in Cape Town.

In August 2023, Lavrov attended the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, South Africa in the place of President Vladimir Putin, who subsequently appeared via video link. This was due to South Africa&#x27;s membership of the Hague-based International Criminal Court, who issued an arrest warrant for Putin, as well as Presidential Commissioner for Children&#x27;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova in March of the same year over allegations of forced deportations of children over the course of the invasion of Ukraine.
Lavrov condemned Hamas&#x27;s October 2023 attack on Israel, but also criticized Israel&#x27;s &quot;indiscriminate&quot; force and &quot;flagrant&quot; violations of international humanitarian law in the Israel–Hamas war, stating: &quot;If Gaza is destroyed and two million inhabitants are expelled, as some politicians in Israel and abroad propose, this will create a catastrophe for many decades, if not centuries.&quot; He expressed concern over the violence in the occupied West Bank, where &quot;dozens of people have been killed&quot;. On 28 December 2023, Lavrov praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not criticizing Russia in public statements, unlike his predecessor, Yair Lapid. Lavrov also drew a parallel between Russia&#x27;s goals of &quot;demilitarization&quot; and &quot;denazification&quot; of Ukraine, and Israel&#x27;s stated goals of defeating Hamas and extremism in the Gaza Strip.

In June 2024, Lavrov thanked Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for China&#x27;s decision not to attend the Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland.

In June 2024, on the sidelines of the BRICS foreign ministers’ summit in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, Lavrov held bilateral talks with the foreign ministers of Brazil, South Africa, Iran, Laos, Thailand and Ethiopia.

After the 16th BRICS summit in Kazan, Lavrov emphasised &quot;the need to significantly increase the share of the Global South and Global East in the mechanisms of global governance, including the UN Security Council, IMF, World Bank, and WTO.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lavrov speaks Russian, English, Dhivehi, French and Sinhala.

Lavrov is a keen sportsman. He likes to watch football games on television and is an ardent fan of the Moscow club Spartak Moscow. He has been married since 1971 to Maria Lavrova and they have one daughter and two grandchildren. Their daughter Ekaterina Sergeyevna Lavrova, who lived in the US and London while her father was working for the United Nations, is a graduate of Columbia University. Having stayed in New York City until 2014, and spent a long time outside Russia, she is not fluent in Russian. She is married to Russian businessman Alexander Vinokurov.

Lavrov has allegedly had a relationship with his mistress, Svetlana Polyakova, since the early 2000s. In 2016, her daughter Polina Kovaleva purchased an apartment in London&#x27;s elite district of Kensington for £4.4 million in cash when she was 21 years old. She has a master&#x27;s degree from Imperial College London. On 25 March 2022, the British government sanctioned her over allegations of &quot;dirty money&quot; as a part of a broader sanctions regime against corrupt Russian interests following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February.

==Sanctions==
In February, 2022, the European Union, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Australia placed Lavrov under personal sanctions for his role in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, the UK sanctioned Lavrov&#x27;s stepdaughter, Polina Kovaleva. In April 2022, Canada imposed sanctions against Lavrov&#x27;s wife and daughter, Maria Lavrova and Ekaterina Vinokurova. The latter was soon included in Australia&#x27;s sanction list as well.

<doc id="541348" wikidata="Q589911" url="?curid=541348" title="Essequibo River">
<text>The Essequibo River (; originally called by Alonso de Ojeda; ) is the largest river in Guyana, and the largest river between the Orinoco and Amazon. Rising in the Acarai Mountains near the Brazil–Guyana border, the Essequibo flows to the north for through forest and savanna into the Atlantic Ocean. It has a total drainage basin of and an average discharge of .

Territory near the river is argued over by Venezuela and Guyana. The river is administered by Guyana after being previously colonized by the British. Historically, Venezuela has claimed the Essequibo River as their most eastern border, though in practice it was under Dutch control.

==Geography==
The river runs through the Guianan moist forests ecoregion.
The average annual rainfall in the catchment area is 2,174 mm.
There are many rapids and waterfalls (e.g., Kaieteur Falls on the Potaro River) along the route of the Essequibo, and its wide estuary is dotted with numerous small islands. It enters the Atlantic from Georgetown, the capital city of Guyana. The river features Murrays Fall, Pot Falls, Kumaka Falls, and Waraputa Falls.

Its many tributaries include the Rupununi, Potaro, Mazaruni, Siparuni, Kuyuwini, Konawaruk and Cuyuni rivers. For over from its mouth, the river&#x27;s channel is divided by the large flat and fertile islands of Leguan, about , Wakenaam, about , and Hogg Island, about . Fort Island is off the eastern side of Hogg Island. Fort Zeelandia is located on the island, and was the seat of government of the country during the Dutch colonial era. Sloth Island is an eco-tourism island in the river.

===Tributaries===

The main tributaries from the mouth:
==Fauna==
The river has a very rich fauna. More than 300 fish species are known from the Essequibo basin, including almost 60 endemics. This may be an underestimate of the true diversity, as parts of the basin are poorly known. For example, surveys of the upper Mazaruni River found 36–39 species (variation in number due to taxonomy), of which 13–25% still were undescribed in 2013. At least 24 fish species are restricted to Mazaruni River alone.

During floods the headwaters of the Branco River (a part of the Amazon basin) and those of the Essequibo are connected, allowing a level of exchange in the aquatic fauna such as fish between the two systems.

==History==

===15th century===
The first European discovery was by the ships of Juan de Esquivel, deputy of Don Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus in 1498. The Essequibo River is named after Esquivel. In 1499, Amerigo Vespucci and Alonso de Ojeda explored the mouths of the Orinoco and allegedly were the first Europeans to explore the Essequibo. Alonso de Ojeda called it &quot;Rio Dulce&quot; which means &quot;Sweet River&quot; in Spanish.

===16th century===
In 1596 Lawrence Kemys, serving as second-in-command of Walter Raleigh&#x27;s British expedition to Guiana, led a force inland along the banks of the Essequibo River, reaching what he wrongly believed to be Lake Parime. The next year Kemys, in command of the &quot;Darling&quot;, continued the exploration of the Guiana coast and the Essequibo River.

===17th century===
The first European settlement in Guyana was built by the Dutch along the lower part of the Essequibo in 1615. The Dutch colony of Essequibo was founded in 1616 and located in the region of the Essequibo River that later became part of British Guiana.

The Dutch colonists remained on friendly terms with the Native American peoples of the area, establishing riverside sugarcane and tobacco plantations.

===19th century===
The Dutch deterred many attacks from the British, French and Spanish for nearly two centuries, though they would later cede their territory to the British in 1814.

The Independence war of Venezuela beginning in the 19th century ended the missionary settlements. At this time, Britain needed to have a colony, besides Trinidad, to serve the large trade sailboats on their large travel trading route around South America.
Venezuela claims that the Essequibo is the true border between it and Guyana, claiming all territory west of it. The boundary was set between Venezuela and Guyana&#x27;s then colonial power, Great Britain in 1899 through an arbitration proceeding. A letter written by Venezuela&#x27;s legal counsel, named partner Severo Mallet-Prevost of New York City law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle alleged that the Russian and British judges on the tribunal had acted improperly and granted the lion&#x27;s share of the disputed territory to Britain due to a political deal between Russia and the United Kingdom. As a result, Venezuela has revived its claim to the disputed territory.

===20th century===
In August 1995, at Omai mine there was an acid spill in the river by the Canadian gold mining company Cambior. An estimated of waste laced with cyanide was released into the river causing much destruction. The spill was preceded by a smaller sodium cyanide spill in May that killed hundreds of fish.

== Expeditions ==

=== 1837-38 ===
Sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society the German researcher Robert Hermann Schomburgk (1804-1865) investigated the river Essequibo and followed its course to the south-west, while Sipu River flows to a westerly direction. He specified the coordinates of the source at 0°41`northern latitude, while not giving a longitude.

=== 1908 ===
In 1908 the German-American ichthyologist Carl H. Eigenmann traveled on river Essequibo and confluent Potaro. He described 336 fish species in these rivers.

=== 1969 ===

As part of a British Technical Assistance project &quot;Operation El Dorado&quot;, geologists Dr. Jevan P. Berrangé and Dr. Richard L. Johnson made the first topographic and geological maps of Guyana south of latitude 4 degrees north. They examined 1:60,000 scale panchromatic aerial photos with a stereoscope to interpret the physical features and the geology of the region prior to making four expeditions into the field to check their observations. On Expedition III they explored the entire Essequibo basin. They travelled separately in two outboard-powered canoes, each team comprising a geologist and five Amerindians. Starting at Kanashen, they canoed up all the major eastward flowing tributaries: the Kuyuwini, Kassikaityu, Kamoa and Sipu rivers, as well as the Chadikar River which on the basis of its north-south trend and a larger flow of water is considered to be the source of the Essiquibo rather than the eastward flowing Sipu River. In his memoirs Richard Johnson records how he had a line cut through the forest to a small hill near the Chodikar headwaters so that he could stand on the border defined by the watershed, and when he told his line-cutting team that they were looking south across the forest into Brazil his foreman disagreed on the basis that &quot;there are lots of nightclubs in Brazil.&quot; After mapping the tributaries the two teams joined forces and travelled down the Essequibo to its confluence with the Rupununi river at Apoteri.

=== 1971 ===

On February 26, 1971, an expedition set off by hovercraft from Manaus in Brazil where the Amazon River is joined by the Rio Negro. They followed the Negro upstream to where it is joined by the Rio Ireng that forms the border between Brazil and Guyana. After following the Ireng for a few tens of kilometers they hovered about 40 miles across the North Savannas of Guyana to the Rupununi River, which they followed to its confluence with the Essequibo River at Apoteri. The Essequibo was then traversed down to its mouth near Georgetown. The primary purpose of the expedition was filming for the BBC series &quot;The World About Us&quot; with the episode &quot;The Forbidden Route&quot; broadcast in November 1971. The secondary purpose was to demonstrate the abilities of a new type of small hovercraft, the Cushioncraft CC7, thereby promoting sales of this British invention. The expedition team comprised Bob Saunders (BBC producer and team leader), Tommy Tomlinson (CC7 pilot), Jevan Berrangé (navigator and logistics consultant), Len Chrisophers (hovercraft engineer), Peter Smith (sound recordist), and Tony Morrison (cameraman). Fuel dumps for the hovercraft were laid down at intervals ahead of the expedition, by boat on the Rio Negro, by plane in the North Savannas and by float-plane on the Essequibo. As there were no reliable maps of the route, navigation in Guyana was done by 1:60,000 scale aerial photographs and by scouting rapids in a motorised inflatable dinghy ahead of the CC7. This was the first expedition to travel by river, land, and sea from Manaus to Georgetown, a total distance of about .

=== 2013 ===
A Guyanese-German expedition in Guyana in April and May 2013 followed the course of the Sipu River to detect the still unknown headwaters of the Essequibo. It was sponsored by the French-German TV Company ARTE and was organized by Duane De Freitas (Rupununi Trails) and the film production team of Marion Pöllmann and Rainer Bergomaz (Blue Paw Artists). The responsible scientist for remote sensing, geodesy and mapping was Prof. Dr. Martin Oczipka from the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTW Dresden). The expedition was only realizable with the support of the Guyanese government and the indigenous tribe of Wai-Wai-Amerindian settling in the very south of Guyana.
With the support of the Wai-Wai, satellite maps, topographic maps, GPS and a small drone, the source valley was discovered in 2013. The coordinate determined by expedition teams in 2013 deviates by approximately 40`, which corresponds to a distance of at least 80 km north. This could be caused by calculation errors or other mistakes. Possibly he followed a different branch of the river more in the South of Guyana. To further investigate this, additional research is necessary, preferably in the original reports of Robert Hermann Schomburgk from his expedition in 1837/38. For the accurate determination of the headwaters and their proper classification, further extensive geological and hydrological studies are necessary.

=== 2018 ===
In 2018, with the support of the First Lady, Sandra Granger, a group consisting of five Wai-wai, two English, one Iranian, and one South African located the furthest source of the Essequibo River. They built upon information and experience from the above 2013 Guyanese German expedition alongside topographical maps, local Wai Wai knowledge, GPS, and machetes to follow the Sipu River to its source. The multinational team &#x27;Running the Essequibo&#x27; followed the main channel and investigated tributaries until they reached the watershed. There, 20 metres away from the Brazilian border, they logged what is now acknowledged to be the furthest source of the Essequibo River.

GPS co-ordinates: N1° 24.5243&#x27; , W59° 16.5107&#x27;

The team then began their world-first descent of the Essequibo River. The team of nine paddled back to Kanashan, aka Gunns Strip, where the Wai Wai members returned home and Romel Shoni and Anthony Shushu joined the expedition. This team, accompanied later further downriver by Fay James (Macushi people), then paddled the remaining distance to the mouth of the Essequibo where it meets the Atlantic Ocean.

This expedition lasted a total of 10 weeks.

Team members: Laura Bingham (expedition leader), Ness Knight, Pip Stewart, Peiman Zekavat (film director), Jon Williams (cameraman), Nereus Chekema, Nigel Isaacs, Jackson (Elijah) Marawanaru, Aron Marawanaru, James Suse, Fay James, Romel Shoni, and Anthony Shushu.
