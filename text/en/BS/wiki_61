<text>Beer is a seaside village and civil parish in the East Devon district of Devon, England. The village faces Lyme Bay and is a little over west of the town of Seaton. It is situated on the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and its picturesque cliffs, including Beer Head, form part of the South West Coast Path.

At the 2021 Census, the parish had a population of 1,283.

==History==
Beer is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, at which time it was located within Colyton hundred and had 28 households. Its name is not derived from the drink, but from the Old English word &quot;bearu&quot;, meaning &quot;grove&quot; and referring to the original forestation that surrounded the village.

It is a coastal village that grew up around a smugglers&#x27; cove and caves which were once used to store contraband goods. These are now part of the attraction of the village.

Beer is home to a cave complex, the Beer Quarry Caves, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone. This stone has been prized since Roman times, because of its workability for carving and for its gentle yellow colour on exposure to air. Beer stone was used in the construction of 24 cathedrals around the UK, including Exeter Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and was also used in the building of Christ Church Cathedral, Missouri.

Bovey House, an Elizabethan manor house, is a mile inland.

Historically, the main sources of income for the village included fishing and lace production.

Bacteria taken from cliffs at Beer on the south coast were launched to the International Space Station in 2008. The Beer microbes were placed on the European Space Agency&#x27;s (ESA) Technology Exposure Facility and were sent up still sitting on, and in, small chunks of cliff rock from the Jurassic Coast. After 553-days scientists found that many were still alive. The survivors are now reproducing in a laboratory. This was part of an experiment to study the survival of microbes (which naturally live on the stone) in extreme conditions. A new species of cyanobacteria was isolated at the Open University that could be used in future space settlements on the Moon and Mars to produce oxygen and break down rocks. 


==Economy==
Nowadays, the sources of income are mainly tourism and fishing. Beer is also the home of the Pecorama (run by the PECO model railway manufacturer), which includes pleasure gardens and the Beer Heights Light Railway.

The shape of the coastline allowed local seafarers to operate in weather conditions when other towns could not, because it is protected from the prevailing westerly winds by Beer Head and the chalk cliffs which are the westernmost outcrop of limestone on the southwest coast. Boats are winched up the beach as there is no harbour, and fresh fish is sold nearby. Nowadays small electrically-driven winches using steel cables or tractors are located on the beach to haul boats in. Higher up is an old manual capstan operated by up to 20 men, now disused.

==Physical features==
Many of the buildings are faced with flint, a hard glassy stone found in the local chalk rock.

A brook winds its way in an open conduit alongside the main road down to the sea.

Beer has a steep pebble beach.

==Transport==

Beer is just off the A3052 which links Exeter to the West and Lyme Regis to the East.

Beer&#x27;s nearest railway station is Axminster railway station, around away, which is on the Exeter to Waterloo line. There is a bus link from the rail station to Beer.

The bus services in the village are provided by locally based AVMT Buses who run services to many of the nearby towns and villages including Seaton, Axminster, Branscombe, Sidmouth, and Colyton.

<doc id="550972" wikidata="Q5962382" url="?curid=550972" title="Jason Loewenstein">
<text>Jason Loewenstein (born July 20, 1971) is an American alternative rock singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and a member of the indie-rock bands Sebadoh, The Fiery Furnaces, and Circle of Buzzards. He grew up in Northampton, Massachusetts, where he attended Northampton High School, and now resides in Brooklyn, New York.

==Sebadoh==

In 1989, Loewenstein was recruited by Eric Gaffney to play drums and bass for Sebadoh. His first songwriting contributions came on &quot;Sebadoh III&quot; and continued on &quot;Bubble &amp; Scrape&quot;, adding &quot;dark .. rough hewn pop gems&quot; like &quot;Happily Divided&quot; and &quot;Sister&quot;.

Following Gaffney&#x27;s departure from Sebadoh in 1993, Loewenstein assumed a higher songwriting profile, contributing five songs to 1994&#x27;s &quot;Bakesale&quot;.

This continued on the last two Sebadoh releases &quot;Harmacy&quot; and &quot;The Sebadoh&quot;, after which the group went on hiatus until 2003/2004 when he and Lou Barlow toured as a duo on a tour they called &quot;Turbo Acoustic&quot;, with Loewenstein and Barlow playing along to drum tracks that were pre-recorded by Loewenstein.

In 2007, he, Barlow and Gaffney reformed the &quot;Sebadoh Classic&quot; trio and toured throughout the United States and Europe.

==Solo work==
Loewenstein&#x27;s first official solo work came under the name of Sparkalepsy with the &quot;Heather&#x27;s Overbite&quot; EP, released in 1994.

In 2002, he produced and played every instrument on his first solo album &quot;At Sixes and Sevens&quot;, which was released on Sub Pop. The touring band for that record included Kevin Mazzarelli and Bob D&#x27;Amico, who would later join Jason in playing with the Fiery Furnaces in addition to forming Circle of Buzzards with him in 2008, as well as eventually joining Sebadoh when they reformed in 2011. In late 2016 it was announced that Jason would be releasing a new solo record on Joyful Noise Recordings titled Spooky Action. A single for the song Machinery was released before the release date of June 16, 2017 was announced. The album was promoted partly through a unique tour of small DIY house shows throughout the South and the Midwest booked by Jonathan Lee Horne from Joyful Noise Records. In a Subaru Outback, with a backing band featuring Bob D&#x27;Amico and Matthew Friedberger, they performed in living rooms, basements and illegal venues. The uniqueness of this tour was in the fact that all tickets were online, all the venues were non commercial (private houses, basements, etc) and voluntarily given by the hosts! The idea for doing the early shows came from drummer Bob D&#x27;Amico who has convinced Sebadoh to do the same.

==Fiery Furnaces==

From August 2005 to the present, Jason has performed and recorded with the Brooklyn-based band The Fiery Furnaces, playing bass and guitar. He acted as engineer on their 2008 release &quot;Remember&quot; and 2009&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Going Away&quot;.

==Other work==
He has also played drums on several albums including Will Oldham&#x27;s album &quot;Viva Last Blues&quot;, David Kilgour&#x27;s (The Clean) &quot;Frozen Orange&quot;, Brett Eugene Ralph&#x27;s &quot;Kentucky Chrome Review&quot;, and Lou Barlow&#x27;s &quot;EMOH&quot;.

<text>ENSAE Paris, officially École nationale de la statistique et de l&#x27;administration économique de Paris (; &quot;Paris National School of Statistics and Economical Management&quot;), is a grande école in France and a member of IP Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). ENSAE Paris is known as the specialization school of École polytechnique for economics, finance, applied mathematics, statistics, and data science. It is one of France&#x27;s top engineering schools and is directly attached to France&#x27;s Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (INSEE) and the French Ministry of Economy and Finance.

==History==
The ENSAE was established in 1942 by the National Statistics Service (ancestor of the INSEE, National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) under the name School of Applied Statistics. In 1946, with the creation of INSEE, the school took the name of INSEE Specialization School. At this time, the school led to two types of administrative careers: &quot;administrateur&quot; (the highest managing level of the INSEE administration) and &quot;attaché&quot; (a lower level) civil servant executive. Early promotions included five or six &quot;administrateurs&quot; students and five or six &quot;attachés&quot; students.

The decree of 2 November 1960 changed the school&#x27;s name to the National School of Statistics and Economic Administration. As a result, the number of students grew, and the school opened to graduate students from law schools and universities of economics. Finally, the decree of 15 April 1971 clarified the administrative status and the objective of the school in the academic field, designating the ENSAE a Grande Ecole.

In the 1980s, a scholarship system was established to support doctoral studies. In addition, a research laboratory, the CREST (Center for Research in Economics and Statistics), a joint laboratory with Ecole Polytechnique, was formed in 1988.

In 1994, the Department of training for &quot;attachés&quot; became a full-fledged school, the National School for Statistics and Analysis Areas information (ENSAI, relocated to Rennes). The &quot;administrateurs&quot; training stayed at the ENSAE where increasing numbers of students chose to specialize in financial modeling and other new areas of applied statistics such as biostatistics or quantitative marketing.

In 2006, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin officially announced the moving of the school to the new ParisTech Campus in Palaiseau, near the École polytechnique, in 2010.

In 2017, the school moved to its current campus in Palaiseau.

== Mission ==

Included in the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) under the tutelage of Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment, ENSAE provides training for statisticians-economists, some of which are civil servants belonging to the Corps des Administrateurs de l&#x27;INSEE, a category of top level public managers in the French administration.

Economists and statisticians trained are intended to contribute to the economic research; former students hold positions within international organizations (UN, IMF, World Bank, European Commission...) and French administration or other public institutions (Ministry of Economy, INSEE, CREST...).

The school admits students from diverse backgrounds:
* Alumni of classes préparatoires (from scientific preparatory classes MP / PC / PSI / MPI, but also business school preparatory classes ( &quot;ECG&quot;) and Humanities and Social Sciences preparatory classes (Khâgne BL)).
* Admission after a graduate degree (normaliens, polytechniciens students or other holders of Grandes écoles Master&#x27;s degrees).
The institution is actually the only French Grande école to admit scientific, business and humanities students, as long as a strong quantitative background is provided.

Since 2006 the school is accredited to deliver the title of &quot;ingénieur&quot; by the French Commission of Engineering Titles.

==Academic affiliations==
The school has several partnerships and agreements with other academic institutions where students can complete their curriculum during their specialization year. A large and growing number of students chose to do such dual degree program in order to get an additional Master of Science, MBA or PhD degree from renowned institutions in the area of economics, finance, statistics, and applied Mathematics where its curriculum is one of the best, such as Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Columbia, NYU, Chicago, Cornell, Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College, LSE, Humboldt University of Berlin, Mannheim, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, etc.

The ENSAE also has a partnership with Sciences Po Paris, HEC Paris, ESSEC Business School, ESCP Business School allowing its students to pursue both curriculum at the same time and get an additional master&#x27;s degree from said universities. The agreement waives the students from passing the entry written examination.

ENSAE was a member of ParisTech, the excellence engineering cluster gathering the best parisian Grandes Ecoles in each area of engineering: X, AgroParisTech, ENGREF, Ponts, ESPCI, Mines, ENSTA, ENSAM, Télécom Paris, Chimie ParisTech.

In 2019, a portion of these schools (including ENSAE, X, Télécom Paris) left ParisTech to create the &quot;Institut Polytechnique&quot;

== Jobs prospects ==
Former ENSAE graduates work in a variety of fields, including data science and machine learning, as well as finance, management, consulting, economic analysis, and research (in economics and statistics).

About 14% of the recent alumni work in the public sector, the remaining works in insurance (25%), consulting (21%) or other industry sectors.

Around 17% of them get a first job outside France, in particular in London and New York. They are hired by tech firms, financial firms such as banks, insurers or hedge funds for their technical expertise in Data Science, Machine learning, finance, mathematics, economics and statistics.

2006 graduate positions are as follows:
* 53% work in Machine learning/Data Science (including research)
* 33% work in finance insurance:
* 21% work in financial engineering
* 7% are traders
* 11% are actuaries
* 3% are portfolio managers
* 24% are work in market survey and consulting:
* 10% economic analysis
* 4% consulting
* 1% audit

Since the ENSAE was founded, more than 6,500 statisticians economists, machine learning engineers, and data scientists have graduated.

==Remark==

Note that the abbreviation ENSAE also refers to SUPAERO, a grande école for aerospace engineering in Toulouse, France (now ISAE). In order to mark the difference between the two schools, ENSAE is called &quot;ENSAE Paris&quot;, in reference to the city where it is located.

<text>Stanisław Franciszek Sosabowski (; 8 May 1892 – 25 September 1967) was a Polish general in World War II. He fought in the Polish Campaign of 1939 and at the Battle of Arnhem (Netherlands), as a part of Operation Market Garden, in 1944 as commander of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade.

== Early military career ==
=== Early years and studies ===
Stanisław Sosabowski was born on 8 May 1892 in Stanislau (), in what was then Austria-Hungary and is now Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. His father was a railway worker. Sosabowski graduated from a local gymnasium and in 1910 he was accepted as a student of the faculty of economy of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. However, the death of his father and the poor financial situation of his family forced him to abandon his studies and return to Stanislau. There he became a member of Drużyny Strzeleckie, a semi-clandestine Polish national paramilitary organisation. He was soon promoted to the head of all Polish Scouting groups in the area.

=== World War I ===

In 1913, Sosabowski was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. After training, he was promoted to the rank of corporal, serving in the 58th Infantry Regiment. After the outbreak of World War I he fought with his unit against the Imperial Russian Army in the battles of Rzeszów, Dukla Pass and Gorlice. For his bravery, he was awarded several medals and promoted to first lieutenant. In 1915, he was badly wounded in action and withdrawn from the front.

In November 1918, after Poland regained its independence Sosabowski volunteered for the newly formed Polish Army, but his wounds were still not healed and he was rejected as a front-line officer. Instead, he became a staff officer in the Ministry of War Affairs in Warsaw.

=== Interwar period ===

After the Polish-Soviet War Sosabowski was promoted to major and in 1922 he started his studies at the Higher Military School in Warsaw. After he finished his studies he was assigned to the Polish General Staff. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, in 1928 he was finally assigned to a front-line unit, the 75th Infantry Regiment, as commanding officer of a battalion. The following year he was assigned to the 3rd Podhale Rifles Regiment as its deputy commander. From 1930 he was also a professor of logistics at his alma mater.

In 1937 Sosabowski was promoted to colonel and became the commanding officer of the 9th Polish Legions Infantry Regiment stationed in Zamość. In January 1939 he became the commander of the prestigious Warsaw-based 21st &quot;Children of Warsaw&quot; Infantry Regiment.

== Invasion of Poland 1939==

According to the Polish mobilisation scheme, Sosabowski&#x27;s regiment was attached to the 8th Infantry Division under Col. . Shortly before the German invasion of Poland started his unit was moved from its garrison in the Warsaw Citadel to the area of Ciechanów, where it was planned as a strategic reserve of the Modlin Army.

On 2 September the division was moved towards Mława and in the early morning of the following day it entered combat in the Battle of Mława. Although the 21st Regiment managed to capture Przasnysz and its secondary objectives, the rest of the division was surrounded by the Wehrmacht and destroyed. After that Sosabowski ordered his troops to retreat towards Warsaw.

On 8 September Sosabowski&#x27;s unit reached the Modlin Fortress. The routed 8th Division was being reconstructed, but the 21st Regiment was attached to the corps led by general Juliusz Zulauf. After several days of defensive fights, the corps was moved to Warsaw, where it arrived on 15 September.

Instantly upon arrival, Sosabowski was ordered to man the Grochów and the Kamionek defensive area and defend Praga, the eastern borough of Warsaw, against the German 10th Infantry Division. During the Siege of Warsaw the forces of Sosabowski were outmanned and outgunned, but managed to hold all their objectives. When the general assault on Praga started on 16 September, the 21st Infantry Regiment managed to repel the attacks of German 23rd Infantry Regiment and then successfully counter-attacked and destroyed the enemy unit.

After this success, Sosabowski was assigned to command all Polish troops fighting in the area of Grochów. Despite constant bombardment and German attacks repeated every day, Sosabowski managed to hold his objectives at relatively low cost in manpower. On 26 September 1939, the forces led by Sosabowski bloodily repelled the last German attack, but two days later Warsaw capitulated. On 29 September, shortly before the Polish forces left Warsaw for German captivity, General Juliusz Rómmel awarded Col. Sosabowski and the whole 21st Infantry Regiment with the Virtuti Militari medal.

== France ==

Following the Polish surrender, Sosabowski was made a prisoner of war and interned at a camp near Żyrardów. However, he escaped and remained in Warsaw under a false name, where he joined the Polish resistance. He was ordered to leave Poland and reached France to report on the situation in occupied Poland. After a long trip through Hungary and Romania, he arrived in Paris, where the Polish government in exile assigned him to the Polish 4th Infantry Division as the commanding officer of infantry.

Initially, the French authorities were very reluctant to hand over the badly needed equipment and armament for the Polish unit. Sosabowski&#x27;s soldiers had to train with pre-World War I weapons. In April 1940, the division was moved to a training camp in Parthenay and was finally handed the weapons awaited since January, but it was already too late to organise the division. Out of more than 11,000 soldiers, only 3,150 were given arms. Knowing this, the commander of the division General ordered his unit to withdraw towards the Atlantic coast. On 19 June 1940, Sosabowski with approximately 6,000 Polish soldiers arrived at La Pallice, whence they were evacuated to Great Britain.

== Great Britain ==
Upon his arrival in London, Sosabowski turned up at the Polish General Staff and was assigned to 4th Rifles Brigade that was to become a core of the future 4th Infantry Division. The unit was to be composed mainly of Polish Canadians, but it soon became apparent that there were not enough young Poles in Canada from which to create a division.

Then, Sosabowski decided to transform his brigade into a Parachute Brigade, the first such unit in the Polish Army. The volunteers came from all the formations of the Polish Army. In Largo House in Fife, a training camp was built and the parachute training was started. Sosabowski himself passed the training and, at 49 years of age, made his first parachute jump. According to relations of Sosabowski&#x27;s former subordinates, the colonel was a strict yet just commander. Impulsive and harsh, Sosabowski could not stand any opposition. This made the creation of a Polish parachute brigade possible, but also made contacts with his superiors problematic.

In October 1942 the Brigade was ready for combat and was named the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Since the Polish General Staff planned to use the Brigade to assist a national uprising in Poland, the soldiers of the &quot;1st Polish Para&quot; were to be the first element of the Polish Army in Exile to reach their homeland. Hence the unofficial motto of the unit: &quot;by the shortest road&quot; (&quot;najkrótszą drogą&quot;).

In September 1943, Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning proposed that Sosabowski reform his unit into a division and fill the remaining posts with British troops. Sosabowski himself would be assigned to the newly formed division and promoted to general. However, Sosabowski refused. Nevertheless, on 15 June 1944 he was promoted to Brigadier General.

== Warsaw Uprising ==

In early August 1944, news of the Warsaw Uprising arrived in Great Britain. The Brigade was ready to be dropped by parachute into Warsaw to aid their comrades from the underground Polish Home Army, who were fighting a desperate battle against overwhelming odds. However, the distance was too great for the transport aircraft to make a round trip and access to Soviet airfields was denied. The morale of the Polish troops suffered badly and many of the units verged on mutiny. The British staff threatened its Polish counterpart with disarmament of the Brigade, but Sosabowski retained control of his unit. Finally, Polish Commander in Chief Kazimierz Sosnkowski put the Brigade under British command, and the plan to send it to Warsaw was abandoned. It was not until after the war that General Sosabowski learnt that his son, , a medic and member of the Kedyw, had lost his sight during the uprising.

==Battle of Arnhem==

During the planning for Operation Market Garden, Sosabowski expressed serious concerns regarding the feasibility of the mission. Among Sosabowski&#x27;s concerns were the poorly conceived drop zones at Arnhem, the long distances between the landing zones and Arnhem Bridge and that the area would contain a greater German presence than British intelligence believed. Despite Sosabowski&#x27;s concerns and warnings from the Dutch Resistance that two SS Panzer Divisions were in the operations area, Market Garden proceeded as planned.

The Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade was among the Allied forces taking part in Market Garden. Due to a shortage of transport aircraft, the brigade was split into several parts before being dropped into the battle. A small part of the brigade with Sosabowski was parachuted near Driel on 19 September, but the rest of the brigade arrived only on 21 September at the distant town of Grave, falling directly on the waiting guns of the Germans camped in the area. The brigade&#x27;s artillery was dropped with the British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General Roy Urquhart, while the howitzers were to arrive by sea, which prevented the brigade from being deployed effectively. Three times Sosabowski attempted to cross the Rhine to come to the assistance of the surrounded 1st Airborne Division. Unfortunately, the ferry they hoped to use had been sunk and the Poles attempting to cross the river in small rubber boats came under heavy fire. Even so, at least 200 men made it across the river and reinforced the embattled British paratroopers.

Despite the difficult situation, at a staff meeting on 24 September, Sosabowski suggested that the battle could still be won. He proposed that the combined forces of XXX Corps, under Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, and the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade should start an all-out assault on the German positions and try to break through the Rhine. This plan was not accepted, and during the last phase of the battle, on 25 and 26 September, Sosabowski led his men southwards, shielding the retreat of the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division. Casualties among the Polish units were high, approaching 40%, and were at least in part, the result of Lieutenant-General Browning&#x27;s decision to drop the paratroops 7 kilometres from the bridge at Arnhem.

After the battle, on 5 October 1944, Sosabowski received a letter from Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, describing the Polish soldiers as having fought bravely and offering awards to ten of his soldiers. However, on 14 October 1944, Montgomery wrote another letter, this time to the British commanders, in which he scapegoated Sosabowski for the failure of Market Garden. Sosabowski was accused of criticizing Montgomery, and the Polish General Staff was forced to remove him as the commanding officer of his brigade on 27 December 1944.

In the opinion of historian Michael Alfred Peszke, &quot;The worst thing that a subordinate can do is to question orders and to be proved right.&quot; Sosabowski had expressed doubts about the feasibility of the Market Garden Operation. 

At the Moscow Conference in October 1944, a turning point came in Anglo-Polish relations. On Prime Minister Churchill&#x27;s request, the Polish delegation arrived in Moscow on 12 October 1944. Upon arrival, Churchill told them to be present at the discussions between himself, Joseph Stalin and the Communist Polish Lublin Committee. Consequently, Churchill coerced Polish Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk into cooperating with Stalin&#x27;s disciples, or else risk losing Britain&#x27;s support for the remainder of the war. From the British perspective, any news that could be beneficial to their coercion tactics would be welcome. The information came on 16 October in a telegram to Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who was present in Moscow as Churchill&#x27;s military advisor.

The message stated that Sosabowski&#x27;s brigade performed badly. Churchill could use this claim to put more pressure on Mikołajczyk to cooperate, because it could be argued that one of his most valuable assets, Sosabowski&#x27;s elite brigade, was no longer useful to the Allied war effort. Montgomery&#x27;s telegram is exceptional to his behavior in that timeframe. Two days prior to the telegram he was praising the Polish contribution to the war, while six weeks later he awarded a Distinguished Service Order to General Stanisław Maczek and decorated members of the Polish 1st Armoured Division. In addition, war correspondents spoke highly of the Polish contribution to Market Garden in the same period as Montgomery was expressing his negative experiences, via Field Marshal Brooke, to Prime Minister Churchill.

Sosabowski was eventually made the commander of rearguard troops and was demobilized in July 1948. He was portrayed by Gene Hackman in the 1977 war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;.

== After the war ==

Shortly after the war Sosabowski succeeded in evacuating his wife and only son from Poland. Like many other Polish wartime officers and soldiers who were unable to return to Communist Poland on pain of repercussions including death or disappearance, he settled in West London. He found a job as a factory worker at the CAV Electrics assembly plant in Acton. He died in London on 25 September 1967. In 1969, Sosabowski&#x27;s remains were returned to Poland, where he was reinterred at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.

In The Hague, on 31 May 2006, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands awarded the Military Order of William to the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. The brigade&#x27;s commander, Sosabowski, was posthumously awarded the &quot;Bronze Lion&quot;. In part this was the result of a Dutch TV documentary depicting the brigade as having played a far more significant role in Market Garden than had been hitherto acknowledged. In this film by Geertjan Lassche, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands said the Poles deserved to be honoured with at least a medal.

The following day, on 1 June, a ceremony was held at Driel, the town where the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade fought. Among the speakers at the ceremony were the mayor of Overbetuwe, as well as Sosabowski&#x27;s grandson and great-grandson.

In the summer of 2012 1st Airborne Major Tony Hibbert made a video appeal for Sosabowski to be pardoned and honoured.

His bust was unveiled on 1 September 2013 in Kraków&#x27;s Jordan Park. Sosabowski is one of many Polish historical figures honoured in the Park.

The elite Polish 6th Airborne Brigade, which traces its traditions back to the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, is officially named &quot;6 Brygada Powietrznodesantowa im. gen. bryg. Stanisława Franciszka Sosabowskiego&quot;, in honor of Sosabowski.

<text>Andijan ( ), also spelt Andijon () and formerly romanized as Andizhan ( ), is a city in Uzbekistan. It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Andijan Region. Andijan is a district-level city with an area of . Andijan is the most densely populated city with density of 10,000 people/km2 and it had 747,800 inhabitants in 2024. Andijan is located in a tense border region at the south-eastern edge of the Fergana Valley near Uzbekistan&#x27;s border with Kyrgyzstan.

At more 2,500 years in age, Andijan is the oldest city in Uzbekistan and one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries B.C.E. Historically, Andijan was an important city on the Silk Road. 

The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Babur who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. Andijan also gained notoriety in 2005 when government forces opened fire on protestors, killing hundreds in what came to be known as the Andijan Massacre.

Andijan was developed into an important industrial city during the Soviet era. Manufactured goods produced in the city include chemicals, domestic appliances, electronics, foodstuffs, furniture, plows, pumps, shoes, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and wheelchairs.

Andijan experiences frequent seismic activity and was destroyed by a large earthquake in 1902. This was the worst earthquake to occur in Uzbekistan in the 20th century.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The origin of the name of the city is uncertain. Arab geographers of the 10th century referred to Andijan as &quot;Andukan,&quot; &quot;Andugan,&quot; or &quot;Andigan.&quot; The traditional explanation links the name of the city to the Turkic tribal names &quot;Andi&quot; and &quot;Adoq&quot;/&quot;Azoq&quot;.

=== Early history ===
Andijan is one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries. Historically, Andijan was an important city on the Silk Road.

The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Babur who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian Subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor.

After the formation of the Khanate of Kokand in the 18th century, the capital was moved from Andijan to Kokand. In the mid-19th century, the Russian Empire began occupying the area of present-day Central Asia. In 1876, the Russians conquered the Khanate of Kokand and the city of Andijan along with it.

Andijan was the center and flashpoint of the Andijan Uprising of 1898 in which the followers of Sufi leader Madali Ishan attacked the Russian barracks in the city, killing 22 and injuring 16-20 more. In retaliation, 18 of the participants were hanged and 360 exiled.

===20th century===
====1902 earthquake====
On 16 December 1902, much of the city was leveled by a severe earthquake which destroyed up to 30,000 homes in the region and killed as many as 4,500 residents. After Soviet rule was established in Andijan in 1917, the city quickly became an important industrial city in the Uzbek SSR.

====Soviet era====

During the Soviet demarcation of Central Asia, Andijan was separated from its historical hinterland as the Ferghana Valley was divided among three separate Soviet republics. Andijan itself became part of the Uzbek SSR.

During World War II, many Soviet citizens were evacuated to Andijan and the surrounding towns. Of the Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied Poland and banished by the Soviets to Siberia and Central Asia, some relocated to Andijan starting in 1941.

====Post-Soviet Islamic fundamentalism====
In the 1990s, Andijan and the surrounding region became politically unstable. Poverty and an upsurge in Islamic fundamentalism produced tensions in the region. The town, and the region as a whole, suffered a severe economic decline following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Repeated border closures badly damaged the local economy, worsening the already widespread poverty of Andijan&#x27;s inhabitants.

=====May 2005 massacre=====
On 13 May 2005, Uzbekistan&#x27;s military opened fire on a mass of people who were protesting against poor living conditions and corrupt government. The estimates of those killed on 13 May range from 187, the official count of the government, to several hundred. A defector from the SNB alleged that 1,500 were killed. The bodies of many of those who died were allegedly hidden in mass graves following the massacre.

The Uzbek government at first stated that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan organized the unrest and that the protesters were members of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Critics have argued that the radical Islamist label has been just a pretext for maintaining a repressive regime in the country.

Whether troops fired indiscriminately to prevent a colour revolution or acted legitimately to quell a prison break is also disputed. Another theory is that the dispute was really an inter-clan struggle for state power. The Uzbek government eventually acknowledged that poor economic conditions in the region and popular resentment played a role in the uprising.

==Geography==

Andijan is located above sea level on the southeastern edge of the Fergana Valley, near Uzbekistan&#x27;s border with Kyrgyzstan. By road it is northeast of Asaka and southeast of Namangan.

===Climate===
Andijan has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold winters and hot summers, with a very continental climate, although winters are milder than one might expect for a location in Central Asia. Rainfall is generally light and erratic, and summers are particularly dry.

Fertile soils, abundance of heat and light, long frost-free period (about 210 days a year) favor the cultivation of heat-loving crops - cotton, mulberry, citrus and other subtropical crops in the vicinity of the city.

Andijan is surrounded by the foothills of the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains, which in summer are covered with snowy peaks, and in the lower reaches are enveloped by forest groves of walnut and coniferous forests.

Winters are usually mild and short. Winds are weaker than in the western parts of the valley, averaging 5 m/s, and average annual precipitation is 232 mm per year. Summers are comparatively less hot than in Central Asia.

=== Canals and rivers ===
Main water arteries of Andijan city:

* &quot;Andijonsoy&quot; canal, which crosses Andijan from south-east to north-west (urban length of the canal is 20 km with stream bed width from 5 to 10 meters);
* 2 rowing canals in the north-west suburb of Andijan (according to the new site plan they are not included in the city limits) are parallel and have a length of about 2.8 km with a width of 35-45 meters;
* The Kara Darya River flows from the north-east to the north-west of Andijan and its suburbs 3-5 km from the city limits.

Despite the fact that in some places the urban neighborhoods of Andijan&#x27;s suburbs and the buildings of the Tashkent State Agrarian University are adjacent to the river, the waterfront was not included in the new general plan of Andijan (adopted and approved in 2017) and in the city limits.

=== Vegetation ===
The vegetation of Andijan is diverse and rich. The city itself is decorated with exotic, ornamental, subtropical, fruit, citrus, nut, coniferous and deciduous crops of trees and shrubs. Floriculture and horticulture are widely developed.

In the years of Uzbekistan&#x27;s independence, great importance was attached to planting exotic and subtropical crops to replace the year-round weedy chinar.

In the city streets, squares, alleys and near administrative buildings began to be planted:

* exotic palm trees;
* ornamental trees;
* deciduous trees.

Conifers have been well established in Andijan for many decades, and over the last 25 years coniferous and fir trees have become very popular in the city (especially picea abies and blue spruce, archa, juniper, fir, cupressus, pine and cedrus).

Chestnuts and walnuts are also being planted in Andijan, almonds, pistachios, diospyros, elaeagnus angustifolia, jujube, pomegranate trees, wine trees (yellow and black figs), laurus and various fruit trees are growing in the courtyards.

==Demographics==
In 2022, Andijan had a population of 458,500. Representatives of many ethnic groups can be found in the city. Uzbeks are the largest ethnic group.

==Economy==
Andijan has been an important craft and trade center in the Fergana Valley since the 15th century. After annexation by the Russians in 1876, the economy of the city started to grow significantly. Several industrial plants were built in Andijan after the city was connected with Russia with a railway line in 1889. Several hospitals, pharmacies, banks, and printing houses were established in the city during that period. After Soviet rule was established in late December 1917, both light and heavy industries developed significantly. Andijan became the first city in Uzbekistan to be fully supplied with natural gas.

Andijan remains an important industrial city in independent Uzbekistan. There are 48 large industrial plants and about 3,000 small and medium enterprises in the city. Manufactured goods produced in the city include chemicals, domestic appliances, electronics, foodstuffs, furniture, plows, pumps, shoes, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and wheelchairs. Andijan is also home to over 50 international companies, five of which produce spare parts for GM Uzbekistan.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name of the city of Andijan is complex and yet to be fully determined, involving as it does not only the speculation of certain scholars but also the cautious interpretation of several local folk legends:

* The emergence of the city is associated with the name of the Turanian princess Adinajan, daughter of Afrosiab, the legendary ruler of ancient Turan. In search of a cure for her chronic ill-health, the ailing princess sought and found healing in one of the mountain valleys of the foothills of Takht-e Soleymān. To commemorate her miraculous recovery, Afrosiab built for his beloved daughter a castle, surrounded by a great and wondrous garden, in the lush valley which had restored her to health. Consequently this area, located in the lower reaches of the mountain river Oshsay, was named Adinajan, after the princess, and the city, which later grew up around her castle, was given the name Andijan, a modified form of her name. To do her further honour, the doting Afrosiab made Andijan the capital of his majestic kingdom of Turan.
* The origin of the toponym is directly connected with the Turkic-speaking peoples &quot;Adok&quot;, &quot;Azok&quot; and &quot;Andi&quot;. Folk rumor says that in ancient times these lands were inhabited by the Andi tribe, i.e. Hindus, and therefore the area was called &quot;Andukan&quot; (or &quot;Hindu refuge&quot;).
* The name of the city is connected with the name of the so-called &quot;discoverer&quot; of the region, who laid the foundation of the future city. His name was Andi. So, in honor of the ancient builder-architect the city was named &quot;Andijan&quot;.
* Russian historian V. P. Nalivkin supposes that the toponym &quot;Andigan&quot; appeared due to the name of the Turkic tribe Andi. The fact is that until some time residents of neighboring regions often called Andijan Uzbeks by the name of Andi, and claimed that Andi were of the same origin as those Turks who lived in the cities of Central Asia.
* According to Vasily Bartold, Andijan was founded by Mongol Khans at the end of the XIII century. Turks from different tribes and clans were transferred here. At the end of the XV century Andijan was considered a predominantly Turkic city in Fergana.
* The state of Andia existed in the southern part of the Caspian Sea.
*Andi is a place of meeting and kurultais of Turkic tribes to solve friendly and important issues.

== Education ==
There are four higher education institutions in Andijan City. Andijan state university, Andijan medical institute, Andijan machine-building institute and Andijan branch Tashkent state agrarian university. The Andijan Medical Institute is the largest of the four. In 2022, Andijan state institute of foreign languages was founded, being the only state institute where foreign languages are taught. The city is also home to four colleges, one academic lyceum, 21 vocational schools, 47 secondary schools, three music and art schools, nine sports schools, and 86 kindergartens.
== Main sights ==
Andijan Jame Mosque Complex architectural monument (late 19th century). It consists of a mosque, a madrasa, and a minaret. In the mid-19th century, the city status was granted to settlements with a mosque in Uzbekistan. The construction of the Mosque Complex took place from 1883 to 1890 and it covers a total area of 1.5 hectares.

<text>Russell &quot;Russ&quot; Pollard (born 1975) is an American rock musician, who has been a member of Sebadoh, The Folk Implosion, Alaska!, Everest, and the Calf Fiends, a trio fronted by Louisville-born writer J.D. Daniels which also included stalwart Louisville musician Tony Bailey, who died in 2009 at age 31. 

==Biography==
Pollard started off as a member of Louisville post-hardcore stalwarts Hedge and Out, before moving on to the energetic prog-punk of the Calf Fiends in 1996-1997. Pollard joined Sebadoh in the late 1990s as drummer, playing on the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Sebadoh&quot;. He formed Alaska! in 2000 with Imaad Wasif in Los Angeles, the band releasing their debut album &quot;Emotions&quot; in 2003. His working relationship with Sebadoh&#x27;s Lou Barlow continued when he played on Sentridoh&#x27;s &quot;Free Sentridoh: Songs from Loobiecore&quot; album, and he is also a member of the Folk Implosion, becoming Barlow&#x27;s main songwriting partner after the departure of John Davis. He also played drums on Barlow&#x27;s 2005 solo album &quot;Emoh&quot;.

After Alaska!&#x27;s final album &quot;Rescue Through Tomahawk&quot; was released in 2005 he formed Everest in Los Angeles, as singer and guitarist. The debut Everest album, &quot;Ghost Notes&quot;, was released in 2008. Everest toured with Wilco and Neil Young in 2008-09, signed to Young&#x27;s Vapor Records label, and played live on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. Pollard&#x27;s second album with Everest, &quot;On Approach&quot;, was released in 2010.

Pollard also recorded with former Sebadoh bandmate Jason Loewenstein as Amnesiac Godz, and played bass and drums on Earlimart&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Mentor Tormentor&quot;.

Pollard also produced and performed on The Watson Twins debut EP &quot;Southern Manners&quot;, and co-produced their albums &quot;Fire Songs&quot; and &quot;Talking to You, Talking to Me&quot;.

He also acted in the 2002 movie &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;, playing the part of Rowan, a drummer in Ian&#x27;s (Alessandro Nivola) band. He co-composed The Folk Implosion&#x27;s &quot;Make it With the Best&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Alaska!&#x27;s &quot;Resistance&quot;, which was used in the soundtrack of &quot;Catch and Release&quot;.

<text>A pantry is a room or cupboard where beverages, food, (sometimes) dishes, household cleaning products, linens or provisions are stored within a home or office. Food and beverage pantries serve in an ancillary capacity to the kitchen.

== Etymology==
The word &quot;pantry&quot; derives from the same source as the Old French term ; that is from , the French form of the Latin , &quot;bread&quot;.

==History in Europe and United States==

===Late Middle Ages===
In a late medieval hall, there were separate rooms for the various service functions and food storage. The pantry was a dry room where bread was kept and food preparation was done. The head of the office who is responsible for this room is referred to as a &quot;pantler.&quot; There were similar rooms for cooler storage of meats and lard/butter (larder), alcoholic beverages (buttery, known for the &quot;butts&quot;, or barrels, stored there), and cooking (kitchen).
===Colonial Era===
In the United States, pantries evolved from early Colonial American &quot;butteries&quot;, built in a cold north corner of a colonial home (more commonly referred to and spelled as &quot;butt&#x27;ry&quot;), into a variety of pantries in self-sufficient farmsteads. Butler&#x27;s pantries, or China pantries, were built between the dining room and kitchen of a middle-class English or American home, especially in the latter part of the 19th into the early 20th centuries. Great estates, such as the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina or Stan Hywet Hall in Akron, Ohio, had many pantries and other domestic &quot;offices&quot;, echoing their British &quot;great house&quot; counterparts.

===Victorian Era===
By the Victorian era, large houses and estates in Britain maintained the use of separate rooms, each one dedicated to distinct stages of food preparation and cleanup. The kitchen was for cooking, while food was stored in a storeroom, pantry or cellar. Meat preparation was done in a larder as game would come in undressed, fish unfilleted, and meat in half or quarter carcasses. Vegetable cleaning and preparation would be done in the scullery. Dishwashing was done in a scullery or butler&#x27;s pantry, &quot;depending on the type of dish and level of dirt&quot;.

Since the scullery was the room with running water with a sink, it was where the messiest food preparation took place, such as cleaning fish and cutting raw meat. The pantry was where tableware was stored, such as China, glassware, and silverware. If the pantry had a sink for washing tableware, it was a wooden sink lined with lead to prevent chipping the China and glassware while they were being washed. In some middle-class houses, the larder, pantry, and storeroom might simply be large wooden cupboards, each with its exclusive purpose.

==Types==

=== Asian Pantry ===

Traditionally, kitchens in Asia have been more open format than those of the West. The function of the pantry was generally served by wooden cabinetry. For example, in Japan, a kitchen cabinet is called a &quot;mizuya tansu&quot;. A substantial tradition of woodworking and cabinetry in general developed in Japan, especially throughout the Tokugawa period. A huge number of designs for &quot;tansu&quot; (chests or cabinets) were made, each tailored towards one specific purpose or another.

The idea is very similar to that of the Hoosier cabinet, with a wide variety of functions being served by specific design innovations.

===Butler&#x27;s pantry===

A butler&#x27;s pantry or serving pantry is a utility room in a large house, primarily used to store serving items, rather than food. Traditionally, a butler&#x27;s pantry was used for cleaning, counting, and storage of silver. European butlers often slept in the pantry, as their job was to keep the silver under lock and key. The merchant&#x27;s account books and wine log may also have been kept in there. The room would be used by the butler and other domestic staff. Even in households where there is no butller, it is often called a butler&#x27;s pantry.

In modern houses, butler&#x27;s pantries are usually located in transitional spaces between kitchens and dining rooms and are used as staging areas for serving meals. They commonly contain countertops, as well as storage for candles, serving pieces, table linens, tableware, wine, and other dining room articles. More elaborate versions may include dishwashers, refrigerators, or sinks.

Butler&#x27;s pantries have become popular in recent times.

=== Cold pantry ===


Certain foods, such as butter, eggs, and milk, need to be kept cool. Before modern refrigeration was available, iceboxes were popular. However, the problem with an icebox was that the cabinet housing it was large, but the actual refrigerated space was relatively small. A clever and innovative solution was invented, the &quot;cold pantry&quot;, sometimes called a &quot;California cooler.&quot; The cold pantry usually consisted of a cabinet or cupboard with wooden-slat shelves for air circulation. An opening near the top vented to the outside, either through the roof or high out the wall. A second opening near the bottom vented also to the outside, but low near the ground and usually on the north side of the house, where the air was cooler. As the air in the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent. This in turn drew cooler air in from the lower vent, providing constant circulation of cooler air. In the summertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would usually hover several degrees lower than the ambient temperature in the house, while in the wintertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would be considerably lower than that in the house.

A cold pantry was the perfect place to keep food stocks that did not necessarily need to be kept refrigerated. Breads, butter, cheesecakes, eggs, pastries, and pie were the common food stocks kept in a cold pantry. Vegetables could be brought up from the root cellar in smaller amounts and stored in the cold pantry until ready to use. With space in the icebox at a premium, the cold pantry was a great place to store fresh berries and fruit.

=== Hoosier Cabinet ===
First developed in the early 1900s by the Hoosier Manufacturing Company in New Castle, Indiana, and popular into the 1930s, the Hoosier cabinet and its many imitators soon became an essential fixture in American kitchens. Often billed as a &quot;pantry and kitchen in one&quot;, the Hoosier brought the ease and readiness of a pantry, with its many storage spaces and working counter, right into the kitchen. It was sold in catalogues and through a unique sales program geared towards farm wives. Today, the Hoosier cabinet is a much sought-after domestic icon and widely reproduced.

Chapters of earlier books, particularly written during the era of domestic science and home economics in the latter half of the 19th century, featured how to furnish, keep, and clean a pantry. Catharine E. Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, in their seminal &quot;The American Woman&#x27;s Home&quot; (1869), advocated the elimination of the pantry by installing pantry shelving and cabinetry in the kitchen. This idea did not take hold in American households until a century later, by which time the pantry had become a floor-to-ceiling cabinet in the Post-Vietnam War kitchen. During the Victorian era and until the Second World War, when housing changed considerably, pantries were commonplace in virtually all American homes. This was because kitchens were small and strictly utilitarian, and not the domestic center of the home. Thus, pantries were important workspaces with their built-in shelving, cupboards and countertops.

In the last chapter of &quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot;, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote a descriptive account of the pantry that Almanzo Wilder built for her in their first home together in DeSmet, South Dakota. It details a working farmhouse pantry in great detail, which she sees for the first time after her marriage to Wilder and subsequent journey to their new home.

Pantry raids were often common themes in children&#x27;s literature and early 20th century advertising. Perhaps the most famous pantry incident in literature was when Mark Twain&#x27;s Tom Sawyer had to do penance for getting into his Aunt Polly&#x27;s jam in her pantry: as punishment, he had to whitewash her fence.

<doc id="551020" wikidata="Q1478944" url="?curid=551020" title="Leæther Strip">
<text>Leæther Strip is a Danish musical project founded on 13 January 1988 by Claus Larsen. Its influence has been most felt in the electronic body music and electro-industrial genres. Leæther Strip was one of the earliest and most prominent acts on Germany&#x27;s now defunct Zoth Ommog record label. For distribution outside of Europe, the music has been licensed to the U.S. labels Cleopatra Records and Metropolis Records. After the demise of Zoth Ommog in 1999, Larsen signed to Bloodline Records, which only released a single before also going out of business. In 2005, Leæther Strip signed with the Belgian-based label Alfa Matrix. On 3 June 2011 Larsen announced his split from Alfa Matrix in order to self-release future material.

== History ==
Larsen was born on 13 November 1967 in Aalborg, Denmark. He first released music under the name of Leæther Strip in 1989, but he had been in as many as three bands previously, the last of which was a solo &quot;instrumental melodic techno&quot; project named Forbidden Art. His 1995 release &quot;G.A.W.M.U.S.&quot; (Getting Away With Murder U. S.) included two early demos from 1982 and 1984, with the latter forming the unknown beginning of the band according to an interview conducted with Claus Larsen. In 1991, Larsen created a side-project called Klute in which he also remained the sole member.

The band name was intended to convey the literal meaning — a small band of leather — though Larsen has been guarded as to the reason. During some early shows, the racy implications of the name &quot;strip&quot; led some to believe that his act was explicitly pornographic to the point where one show was scouted by a pornographic magazine.

His first album, &quot;The Pleasure of Penetration&quot;, was produced by Talla 2XLC (Andreas Tomalla of Bigod 20) and Ra/Hen (Ralf Henrich of Robotiko Rejekto) and released on the German label Zoth Ommog Records. His early records were labeled &quot;industrial&quot; music, although Larsen himself had no specific opinion of what genre the music fit into. In 1994, Larsen changed the sound of Leæther Strip, with the release of a synthesized semi classical album, &quot;Serenade for the Dead&quot;, which was conceived as a soundtrack to a fictional film. This change in sound was compounded by the tragedy of the near death of his father and culminated in the darker and more somber 1995 album &quot;Legacy of Hate and Lust&quot;. The releases since then have reincorporated electronic dance elements, and have redefined Leæther Strip into what Larsen calls &quot;symphonic electro&quot;.

Leæther Strip remained silent for several years after the release of the single &quot;Carry Me&quot; in 2000 and the official band website, which once contained a wealth of information regarding the project, was taken offline. In foreshadowing the return of his band, Larsen&#x27;s remix of the band KiEw&#x27;s song &quot;Graograman&quot; on the &quot;Diskette&quot; EP (2003) states at the beginning of the song, in a sing-song computer-generated voice, &quot;Leæther Strip will return for more electronic mayhem&quot;. In an interview conducted late 2005, Larsen revealed that label issues, as well as personal concerns, caused the dormancy of the band during the 2000–2005 period.

28 October 2005 marked the official return of Leæther Strip with the EP release &quot;Suicide Bombers&quot; on the Alfa Matrix label. Claus Larsen opened a blog to inform fans of his current activities and progress on the project. A string of releases followed including the 2-CD album &quot;After the Devastation&quot;, and the 2006 EP releases &quot;Walking on Volcanos&quot; and &quot;Fætish&quot;. Also in 2006, Claus Larsen released a free song via his MySpace page, a remix of &quot;Frank Tovey taught me things&quot;. The song was subsequently downloaded over 10,000 times.

On 13 April 2007, Leæther Strip released the album &quot;The Giant Minutes to the Dawn&quot;. It was made available in several editions, including a special limited edition box-set which includes the band&#x27;s first DVD release. According to various reviewers, the album constituted the &quot;true&quot; return of the band to classic Leæther Strip form.

In a post to his MySpace blog made in late November 2008, Larsen announced his intention to develop a live show for a small run of exclusive engagements in 2009. Two shows took place in Denmark in April 2009, and Leaether Strip has been confirmed to perform at the Power Strip Festival in the USA and the Amphi Festival in Germany during Summer 2009.

Via a video teaser on YouTube Claus Larsen announced that the first Leaether Strip album, &quot;The Pleasure of Penetration&quot;, would be re-released as a remastered double CD set on 13 November 2007, Claus Larsen&#x27;s birthday, under the title &quot;Retention n°1&quot;. The release is part of an ongoing box series through which Claus Larsen will re-release his complete back-catalogue via the Belgian label Alfa Matrix. Each re-release will have both the fully remastered version of the original album on disc 1 and on the second disc, a totally re-written and reinterpretation of some selected songs from the original album by Leaether Strip himself re-recorded with current technologies. The original track-list on disc 1 has been extended to 15 tracks with the addition of early 12&quot; tracks and other rarities of the period.

Larsen&#x27;s lyrics for Leaether Strip are often frank and direct, sometimes to the point of being hostile. Political songs include the anti-Nazi song &quot;AEighty AEight&quot; which contains the chorus &quot;You are not human / You are not soldiers&quot; as well as the song &quot;Suicide Bombers&quot; (On the Suicide Bombers EP) with its chorus question, &quot;Who told you to die that way?&quot; More frequently, Larsen explores his own personal issues in the same open fashion, resulting in many tracks that are simultaneously aggressive and introspective.

Larsen&#x27;s husband and band companion, Kurt Grünewaldt Hansen, died on 28 September 2020, after a battle with cancer, aged 75.

XOTcl is an object-oriented extension for the Tool Command Language created by Gustaf Neumann and Uwe Zdun. It is a derivative of MIT OTcl and is based on a dynamic object system with metaclasses influenced by CLOS. Class and method definitions in XOTcl are completely dynamic. The language also provides support for design patterns through filters and decorator mixins.

<text>Juno Reactor is a multi-national musical and performing group, primarily based in Brighton, UK. Known for their cinematic fusion of electronic, global influences, and orchestral symphonic approach, collaborating with composer Don Davis and composing for the musical score of &quot;The Matrix (Reloaded and Revolutions)&quot;. Central to the project is Ben Watkins and his collaborations with a constantly changing ensemble of musicians from across the world. This ensemble has included Mabi Thobejane, Amampondo, Steve Stevens, Eduardo Niebla, Greg Ellis, Taz Alexander, Sugizo, Budgie and recently Hamsika Iyer and Magi Hikri.

==History==
Juno Reactor was formed as an art project in 1990. Ben Watkins wanted to collaborate with other artists, producing exciting projects that were not commercially driven. He wanted to create experimental music and non-musical soundtracks that would work with installations, art pieces, and film projects.

Juno Reactor released their first single, &quot;Laughing Gas&quot;, in 1993 on the NovaMute label. This was soon followed by their debut album, &quot;Transmissions&quot;. Later, the band released &quot;Luciana&quot; on Alex Paterson&#x27;s (The Orb) Inter-Modo label. Juno Reactor left NovaMute and Inter-Modo in 1995 and signed with the UK label Blue Room Released to release the single &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;. Their album &quot;Beyond the Infinite&quot; was released in 1995.

The 1997 Blue Room Released &quot;Bible of Dreams&quot; was Juno Reactor&#x27;s fourth album. It had a very different sound from the group&#x27;s previous albums, and moved away from the traditional dance beats by implementing tribal influences. Watkins collaborated with Amampondo, a traditional South African percussion act, on the single &quot;Conga Fury&quot;. Watkins and Amampondo went on a five-week tour of the US, opening for Moby. In 1998, Juno Reactor played a live set with Amampondo at Glastonbury Festival. The group collaborated with The Creatures on the track &quot;I&#x27;m here...Another Planet&quot; for the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998) soundtrack. They teamed up with The Creatures again in 1999 on the track &quot;Exterminating Angel&quot;, featured on that group&#x27;s album &quot;Anima Animus&quot;.

Watkins released the fifth Juno Reactor album, &quot;Shango&quot;, in 2000. It was the first of his albums on Metropolis Records. The first track from the album, &quot;Pistolero&quot;, was a collaboration with Billy Idol&#x27;s guitarist, Steve Stevens. The track was featured during the trailer for the movie &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, as well as in the film itself. In the fall of 2002, Juno Reactor released a new single titled &quot;Hotaka&quot;. It was recorded in a Japanese studio overlooking Mount Fuji. &quot;Hotaka&quot; featured Stevens on guitar, and included traditional Taiko drummers Gocoo. In 2003, the album &quot;Odyssey 1992–2002&quot; was released as a compilation of the best Juno Reactor tracks of the decade.

The sixth Juno Reactor album, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, was released in October 2004, and featured Watkins&#x27; work from the &quot;Matrix&quot; films. The album once again featured the tribal influences present in their music through tracks like &quot;Conquistador II&quot;.

In 2006, Watkins was hired to compose an orchestral score for &quot;Brave Story&quot;, a Japanese anime feature film. Sony Japan released the soundtrack, which was recorded at the Slovak Radio Concert Hall in Slovakia with the Slovak National Symphony Orchestra. The album was written by &quot;Ben Watkins aka Juno Reactor&quot;.

In 2008 Ben Watkins collaborated with anime director Koji Morimoto for &quot;Genius Party Beyond&quot;, an anthology of short animated films from Studio 4 °C.

Juno Reactor&#x27;s album &quot;Gods &amp; Monsters&quot; was released in March 2008, and featured the introduction of Ghetto Priest and Sugizo into the Juno Reactor fold, along with Eduardo Niebla, Xavier Morel, and Yasmin Levy. In 2009, the band toured with drummer Budgie, of the band Siouxsie and the Banshees.

Juno Reactor&#x27;s album &quot;The Golden Sun of the Great East&quot; was released on Metropolis Records in 2013.

Carbon is capable of forming many allotropes (structurally different forms of the same element) due to its valency (tetravalent). Well-known forms of carbon include diamond and graphite. In recent decades, many more allotropes have been discovered and researched, including ball shapes such as buckminsterfullerene and sheets such as graphene. Larger-scale structures of carbon include nanotubes, nanobuds and nanoribbons. Other unusual forms of carbon exist at very high temperatures or extreme pressures. Around 500 hypothetical 3‑periodic allotropes of carbon are known at the present time, according to the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA).

==Atomic and diatomic carbon==
Under certain conditions, carbon can be found in its atomic form. It can be formed by vaporizing graphite, by passing large electric currents to form a carbon arc under very low pressure. It is extremely reactive, but it is an intermediate product used in the creation of carbenes.

Diatomic carbon can also be found under certain conditions. It is often detected via spectroscopy in extraterrestrial bodies, including comets and certain stars.
==Diamond==
&quot;Diamond&quot; is a well-known allotrope of carbon. The hardness, extremely high refractive index, and high dispersion of light make diamond useful for industrial applications and for jewelry. Diamond is the hardest known natural mineral. This makes it an excellent abrasive and makes it hold polish and luster extremely well. No known naturally occurring substance can cut or scratch diamond, except another diamond. In diamond form, carbon is one of the costliest elements.

The crystal structure of diamond is a face-centered cubic lattice having eight atoms per unit cell to form a diamond cubic structure. Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbons in a tetrahedral geometry. These tetrahedrons together form a 3-dimensional network of six-membered carbon rings in the chair conformation, allowing for zero bond angle strain. The bonding occurs through sp3 hybridized orbitals to give a C-C bond length of 154 pm. This network of unstrained covalent bonds makes diamond extremely strong. Diamond is thermodynamically less stable than graphite at pressures below .

The dominant industrial use of diamond is cutting, drilling (drill bits), grinding (diamond edged cutters), and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds, and most diamonds that are not gem-quality can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips and saw blades or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications (due to its extraordinary hardness). Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil), high-performance bearings, and specialized windows of technical apparatuses.

The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as &quot;bort&quot;, are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 400 million carats (80 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds are produced annually for industrial use, which is nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds mined over the same period.

With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable to build microchips from, or the use of diamond as a heat sink in electronics. Significant research efforts in Japan, Europe, and the United States are under way to capitalize on the potential offered by diamond&#x27;s unique material properties, combined with increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from synthetic diamond manufacturers.

==Graphite==

&quot;Graphite&quot;, named by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789, from the Greek γράφειν (, &quot;to draw/write&quot;, for its use in pencils) is one of the most common allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond, graphite is an electrical conductor. Thus, it can be used in, for instance, electrical arc lamp electrodes. Likewise, under standard conditions, graphite is the most stable form of carbon. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds.

Graphite conducts electricity, due to delocalization of the pi bond electrons above and below the planes of the carbon atoms. These electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is only conducted along the plane of the layers. In diamond, all four outer electrons of each carbon atom are &#x27;localized&#x27; between the atoms in covalent bonding. The movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalized system of electrons that is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalized electrons are free to move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct electricity in a direction at right angles to the plane.

Graphite powder is used as a dry lubricant. Although it might be thought that this industrially important property is due entirely to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure, in fact in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite was found to be a very poor lubricant. This fact led to the discovery that graphite&#x27;s lubricity is due to adsorbed air and water between the layers, unlike other layered dry lubricants such as molybdenum disulfide. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for this effect.

When a large number of crystallographic defects (physical) bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes pyrolytic carbon, a useful material in blood-contacting implants such as prosthetic heart valves.

Graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon. Contrary to popular belief, high-purity graphite does not readily burn, even at elevated temperatures. For this reason, it is used in nuclear reactors and for high-temperature crucibles for melting metals. At very high temperatures and pressures (roughly 2000 °C and 5 GPa), it can be transformed into diamond.

Natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials due to their shear-planes, brittleness and inconsistent mechanical properties.

In its pure glassy (isotropic) synthetic forms, pyrolytic graphite and carbon fiber graphite are extremely strong, heat-resistant (to 3000 °C) materials, used in reentry shields for missile nosecones, solid rocket engines, high temperature reactors, brake shoes and electric motor brushes.

Intumescent or expandable graphites are used in fire seals, fitted around the perimeter of a fire door. During a fire the graphite intumesces (expands and chars) to resist fire penetration and prevent the spread of fumes. A typical &quot;start expansion temperature&quot; (SET) is between 150 and 300 °C.

Graphite&#x27;s specific gravity is 2.3, which makes it less dense than diamond.

Graphite is slightly more reactive than diamond. This is because the reactants are able to penetrate between the hexagonal layers of carbon atoms in graphite. It is unaffected by ordinary solvents, dilute acids, or fused alkalis. However, chromic acid oxidizes it to carbon dioxide.

===Graphene===

A single layer of graphite is called graphene and has extraordinary electrical, thermal, and physical properties. It can be produced by epitaxy on an insulating or conducting substrate or by mechanical exfoliation (repeated peeling) from graphite. Its applications may include replacing silicon in high-performance electronic devices. With two layers stacked, bilayer graphene results with different properties.

=== Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) ===
Lonsdaleite is an allotrope sometimes called &quot;hexagonal diamond&quot;, formed from graphite present in meteorites upon their impact on the earth. The great heat and pressure of the impact transforms the graphite into a denser form similar to diamond but retaining graphite&#x27;s hexagonal crystal lattice. &quot;Hexagonal diamond&quot; has also been synthesized in the laboratory, by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives. It can also be produced by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric pressure, under inert gas atmosphere (e.g. argon, nitrogen), starting at temperature .

=== Graphenylene ===
Graphenylene is a single layer carbon material with biphenylene-like subunits as basis in its hexagonal lattice structure. It is also known as biphenylene-carbon.

=== Carbophene ===
Carbophene is a 2 dimensional covalent organic framework. 4-6 carbophene has been synthesized from 1-3-5 trihydroxybenzene. It consists of 4-carbon and 6-carbon rings in 1:1 ratio. The angles between the three σ-bonds of the orbitals are approximately 120°, 90°, and 150°.

===AA&#x27;-graphite===
AA&#x27;-graphite is an allotrope of carbon similar to graphite, but where the layers are positioned differently to each other as compared to the order in graphite.

=== Diamane ===
Diamane is a 2D form of diamond. It can be made via high pressures, but without that pressure, the material reverts to graphene. Another technique is to add hydrogen atoms, but those bonds are weak. Using fluorine (xenon-difluoride) instead brings the layers closer together, strengthening the bonds. This is called f-diamane.

==Amorphous carbon==

&quot;Amorphous carbon&quot; is the name used for carbon that does not have any crystalline structure. As with all glassy materials, some short-range order can be observed, but there is no long-range pattern of atomic positions. While entirely amorphous carbon can be produced, most amorphous carbon contains microscopic crystals of graphite-like, or even diamond-like carbon.

Coal and soot or carbon black are informally called amorphous carbon. However, they are products of pyrolysis (the process of decomposing a substance by the action of heat), which does not produce true amorphous carbon under normal conditions.

==Nanocarbons==

===Buckminsterfullerenes===
The &quot;buckminsterfullerenes&quot;, or usually just &quot;fullerenes&quot; or &quot;buckyballs&quot; for short, were discovered in 1985 by a team of scientists from Rice University and the University of Sussex, three of whom were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They are named for the resemblance to the geodesic structures devised by Richard Buckminster &quot;Bucky&quot; Fuller. Fullerenes are positively curved molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which take the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube (the C60 version has the same form as a traditional stitched soccer ball).

As of the early twenty-first century, the chemical and physical properties of fullerenes are still under heavy study, in both pure and applied research labs. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use — binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma.

===Nanotubes===
Carbon nanotubes, also called buckytubes, are cylindrical carbon molecules with novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications (e.g., nano-electronics, optics, materials applications, etc.). They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique electrical properties, and are efficient conductors of heat. Non-carbon nanotubes have also been synthesized.
Carbon nanotubes are a members of the fullerene structural family, which also includes buckyballs. Whereas buckyballs are spherical in shape, a nanotube is cylindrical, with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers (approximately 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).

===Nanobuds===
&quot;Carbon nanobuds&quot; are a newly discovered allotrope of carbon in which fullerene like &quot;buds&quot; are covalently attached to the outer sidewalls of the carbon nanotubes. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. For instance, they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters.

=== Nanolattices ===
=== Schwarzites ===
Schwarzites are negatively curved carbon surfaces originally proposed by decorating triply periodic minimal surfaces with carbon atoms. The geometric topology of the structure is determined by the presence of ring defects, such as heptagons and octagons, to graphene&#x27;s hexagonal lattice.
(Negative curvature bends surfaces outwards like a saddle rather than bending inwards like a sphere.)

Recent work has proposed zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) may be schwarzites. The name, ZTC, derives from their origin inside the pores of zeolites, crystalline silicon dioxide minerals. A vapor of carbon-containing molecules is injected into the zeolite, where the carbon gathers on the pores&#x27; walls, creating the negative curve. Dissolving the zeolite leaves the carbon. A team generated structures by decorating the pores of a zeolite with carbon through a Monte Carlo method. Some of the resulting models resemble schwarzite-like structures.

==Glassy carbon==

&quot;Glassy carbon&quot; or &quot;vitreous carbon&quot; is a class of non-graphitizing carbon widely used as an electrode material in electrochemistry, as well as for high-temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices.

It was first produced by Bernard Redfern in the mid-1950s at the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK. He had set out to develop a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole (phenolic) resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this resin, the first glassy carbon was produced.

The preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting the organic precursors to a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000 °C. Unlike many non-graphitizing carbons, they are impermeable to gases and are chemically extremely inert, especially those prepared at very high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapor are lower than those of any other carbon. They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal graphite is reduced to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such treatment, even after several months.

==Carbon nanofoam==

&quot;Carbon nanofoam&quot; is the fifth known allotrope of carbon, discovered in 1997 by Andrei V. Rode and co-workers at the Australian National University in Canberra. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web.

Each cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon atoms linked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of buckminsterfullerenes, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons.

The large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an aerogel, but with 1% of the density of previously produced carbon aerogels – only a few times the density of air at sea level. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor electrical conductor.

==Carbide-derived carbon==

Carbide-derived carbon (CDC) is a family of carbon materials with different surface geometries and carbon ordering that are produced via selective removal of metals from metal carbide precursors, such as TiC, SiC, , , etc. This synthesis is accomplished using chlorine treatment, hydrothermal synthesis, or high-temperature selective metal desorption under vacuum. Depending on the synthesis method, carbide precursor, and reaction parameters, multiple carbon allotropes can be achieved, including endohedral particles composed of predominantly amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, epitaxial graphene, nanocrystalline diamond, onion-like carbon, and graphitic ribbons, barrels, and horns. These structures exhibit high porosity and specific surface areas, with highly tunable pore diameters, making them promising materials for supercapacitor-based energy storage, water filtration and capacitive desalinization, catalyst support, and cytokine removal.

Other metastable carbon phases, some diamondlike, have been produced from reactions of SiC or CH3SiCl3 with CF4.
==Linear acetylenic carbon==

A one-dimensional carbon polymer with the structure —(C≡C)n—. Its structure is relatively like that of Amorphous carbon.

==Cyclocarbons==

Cyclo[18]carbon (C18) was synthesized in 2019.

==Other possible allotropes==
Many other allotropes have been hypothesized but have yet to be synthesized.
* &quot;bcc-carbon&quot;: At ultrahigh pressures of above 1000 GPa, diamond is predicted to transform into a body-centered cubic structure. This phase has importance in astrophysics and deep interiors of planets like Uranus and Neptune. Various structures have been proposed. Superdense and superhard material resembling this phase was synthesized and published in 1979 and reported to have the Im space group with eight atoms per primitive unit cell (16 atoms per conventional unit cell). Claims were made that the so-called C structure had been synthesized, having eight-carbon cubes similar to cubane in the Imm space group, with eight atoms per primitive unit cell, or 16 atoms per conventional unit cell (also called supercubane, see illustration to the right). But a paper in 1988 claimed that a better theory was that the structure was the same as that of an allotrope of silicon called Si-III or γ-silicon, the so-called BC8 structure with space group Ia and 8 atoms per primitive unit cell (16 atoms per conventional unit cell). In 2008 it was reported that the cubane-like structure had been identified. A paper in 2012 considered four proposed structures, the supercubane structure, the BC8 structure, a structure with clusters of four carbon atoms in tetrahedra in space group I3m having four atoms per primitive unit cell (eight per conventional unit cell), and a structure the authors called &quot;carbon sodalite&quot;. They found in favor of this carbon sodalite structure, with a calculated density of 2.927 g/cm, shown in the upper left of the illustration under the abstract. This structure has just six atoms per primitive unit cell (twelve per conventional unit cell). The carbon atoms are in the same locations as the silicon and aluminum atoms of the mineral sodalite. The space group, I3m, is the same as the fully expanded form of sodalite would have if sodalite had just silicon or just aluminum.

* &quot;bct-carbon&quot;: Body-centered tetragonal carbon was proposed by theorists in 2010.
*&quot;Chaoite&quot; is a mineral believed to have been formed in meteorite impacts. It has been described as slightly harder than graphite with a reflection color of grey to white. However, the existence of carbyne phases is disputed – see the article on chaoite for details.
* &quot;D-carbon&quot;: D-carbon was proposed by theorists in 2018. D-carbon is an orthorhombic sp3 carbon allotrope (6 atoms per cell). Total-energy calculations demonstrate that D-carbon is energetically more favorable than the previously proposed T6 structure (with 6 atoms per cell) as well as many others.
*Haeckelites: Ordered arrangements of pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons which can either be flat or tubular.
* The &quot;Laves graph&quot; or &quot;K&quot;4 &quot;crystal&quot; is a theoretically predicted three-dimensional crystalline metastable carbon structure in which each carbon atom is bonded to three others, at 120° angles (like graphite), but where the bond planes of adjacent layers lie at an angle of 70.5°, rather than coinciding.
* &quot;M-carbon&quot;: Monoclinic C-centered carbon is thought to have been first created in 1963 by compressing graphite at room temperature. Its structure was theorized in 2006, then in 2009 it was related to those experimental observations. Many structural candidates, including bct-carbon, were proposed to be equally compatible with experimental data available at the time, until in 2012 it was shown theoretically that this structure is kinetically the most likely to form from graphite. High-resolution data appeared shortly after, demonstrating that among all structure candidates only M-carbon is compatible with experiment.
* &quot;Metallic carbon&quot;: Theoretical studies have shown that there are regions in the phase diagram, at extremely high pressures, where carbon has metallic character. Laser shock experiments and theory indicate that above 600 GPa liquid carbon is metallic.
*&quot;Novamene&quot;: A combination of both hexagonal diamond and sp2 hexagons as in graphene.
* &quot;Phagraphene:&quot; Graphene-like allotrope with distorted Dirac cones.
* &quot;Prismane C8&quot; is a theoretically predicted metastable carbon allotrope comprising an atomic cluster of eight carbon atoms, with the shape of an elongated triangular bipyramid—a six-atom triangular prism with two more atoms above and below its bases.
*&quot;Protomene:&quot; A hexagonal crystal structure with a fully relaxed primitive cell involving 48 atoms. Out of these, 12 atoms have the potential to switch hybridization between sp2 and sp3, forming dimers.
* &quot;Q-carbon&quot;: Ferromagnetic carbon was discovered in 2015.
* &quot;T-carbon&quot;: Every carbon atom in diamond is replaced with a carbon tetrahedron (hence &#x27;T-carbon&#x27;). This was proposed by theorists in 1985.
* There is evidence that white dwarf stars have a core of crystallized carbon and oxygen nuclei. The largest of these found in the universe so far, BPM 37093, is located away in the constellation Centaurus. A news release from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics described the -wide stellar core as a &quot;diamond&quot;, and it was named as &quot;Lucy&quot;, after the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot;; however, it is more likely an exotic form of carbon. Penta-graphene is a predicted carbon allotrope that utilizes the Cairo pentagonal tiling.
* &quot;U carbon&quot; is predicted to consist of corrugated layers tiled with six- or 12-atom rings, linked by covalent bonds. Notably, it can be harder than steel, as conductive as stainless steel, highly reflective and ferromagnetic, behaving as a permanent magnet at temperatures up to 125 °C.

*&quot;Zayedene:&quot; A combination of linear sp carbon chains and sp3 bulk carbon. The structure of these crystalline carbon allotropes consists of sp chains inserted in cylindrical cavities periodically arranged in hexagonal diamond (lonsdaleite).

==Variability of carbon==

The system of carbon allotropes spans an astounding range of extremes, considering that they are all merely structural formations of the same element.

Between diamond and graphite:
* Diamond crystallizes in the cubic system but graphite crystallizes in the hexagonal system.
* Diamond is clear and transparent, but graphite is black and opaque.
* Diamond is the hardest mineral known (10 on the Mohs scale), but graphite is one of the softest (1–2 on Mohs scale).
* Diamond is the ultimate abrasive, but graphite is soft and is a very good lubricant.
* Diamond is an excellent electrical insulator, but graphite is an excellent conductor.
* Diamond is an excellent thermal conductor, but some forms of graphite are used for thermal insulation (for example heat shields and firebreaks).
* At standard temperature and pressure, graphite is the thermodynamically stable form. Thus diamonds do not exist forever. The conversion from diamond to graphite, however, has a very high activation energy and is therefore extremely slow.

Despite the hardness of diamonds, the chemical bonds that hold the carbon atoms in diamonds together are actually weaker than those that hold together graphite. The difference is that in diamond, the bonds form an inflexible three-dimensional lattice. In graphite, the atoms are tightly bonded into sheets, but the sheets can slide easily over each other, making graphite soft.

Last of the Curlews is a novel, a fictionalized account of the life of the last Eskimo curlew. It was written by Fred Bodsworth, a Canadian newspaper reporter and naturalist, and published in 1954.

==Plot introduction==
The story follows the bird throughout a year during its migration to South America and return to the Canadian Arctic in search of a mate. Although somewhat anthropomorphic in parts, the book paints a realistic and detailed picture of this bird&#x27;s life and behaviour.

The book may have been somewhat premature in that there were confirmed sightings of this bird in 1963 and there were a number of unconfirmed sightings after that date. However, this bird may now be extinct.

==Television adaptation==
The book was made into an animated film by Hanna-Barbera Productions. The English original version was narrated by Ross Martin, who became famous as the Artemus Gordon character in the original version of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. This film was first shown on October 4, 1972 as the first &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;. It was given an Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Children&#x27;s Programming in 1973.

==Editions==
The 1988 edition () includes a foreword by the Pulitzer Prize winning poet W.S. Merwin and an afterword by the Nobel Laureate physicist Murray Gell-Mann.

<text>Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari (; 25 February 1925 – 28 December 2018) was a Nigerian politician who was the first democratically elected president of Nigeria, after the transfer of power by military head of state General Olusegun Obasanjo in 1979, which gave rise to the Second Nigerian Republic.

An experienced politician, he briefly worked as a teacher before entering politics in 1951; and was elected into the House of Representatives in 1954. At various times between 1958 through independence of Nigeria in 1960 and 1975, he held a cabinet post as a federal commissioner. As president, Shagari presided over the mass deportation of West African migrants in 1983, which primarily impacted Ghanaian migrants in Nigeria.

==Early years==
Shehu Usman Shagari was born on 25 February 1925 in Shagari to a Sunni Muslim Fulani family. The town of Shagari was founded by his great-grandfather, Ahmadu Rufa&#x27;i. He was raised in a polygamous family, and was the sixth child born into the family. His father, Aliyu Shagari, was the &quot;Magajin Shagari&quot; (magaji means village head). Prior to becoming &quot;Magajin Shagari&quot;, Aliyu was a farmer, trader and herder. However, due to traditional rites that prevented rulers from participating in business, Aliyu relinquished some of his trading interests when he became the Magaji. Aliyu died five years after Shehu&#x27;s birth, and Shehu&#x27;s elder brother, Bello, briefly took on his father&#x27;s mantle as &quot;Magajin Shagari&quot;.

Shagari started his education in a Quranic school and then went to live with relatives at a nearby town, where from 1931 to 1935 he attended Yabo elementary school.

== Presidency ==
===Economics===
During the oil boom, Shagari made agriculture, industry, housing and transportation the major economic goals of his administration.

====Agriculture====

Shagari&#x27;s government embarked on a &quot;Green Revolution&quot;, distributing seed and fertilizer to farmers to increase nationwide productivity in farming, In Agriculture. The aim was to foster the use of mechanical machinery in farming. This initiative favoured large scale farmers in order to produce mass products. He also commissioned the Bakalori Dam in Sokoto State, South Chad Irrigation Scheme, Borno State, Kafin Zaki Dam Bauchi State, Ogun River Dam, Ogun State, Dadin Kowa Dam Bauchi State, Goronyo Dam Sokoto State, and Zobe Dam, Kastina State.

====Industry====

In 1980, with the oil revenue, Shagari finished building the Kaduna refinery, which started operating that year. Also with the oil revenue, Shagari started the construction of Ajaokuta Steel Mill which was near completion by 1983. It is the biggest steel project ever embarked in Africa at the time of its construction. The steelworks has been called the &quot;bedrock of Nigeria&#x27;s industrialization&quot;.

Shagari completed the Delta Steel complex in 1982. In 1983, Shagari created the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria at Ikot Abasi. Three other Steel Rolling Mills where built, they include the ones in Osogbo, Katsina and Jos. However, Shagari reduced the share of oil royalties and rents to state of origin from 30 to 2 percent. Shagari also established a Petroleum Training Institute.

There were also motor vehicle plants such as ANAMMCO in Anambra commissioned in 1980, The Volkswagen Assembly Plantvin Oyo State, Peugeot Automobile in Kaduna State, FIAT in Kano State and Styer in Bauchi State.

====Housing====

In housing, Shagari had the target of building 200,000 housing units, but by June 1983, only thirty thousand (32,000) units had been completed. Despite its shortcomings, it is the largest public housing project Nigeria has ever seen.

====Transportation====

In transportation, he launched many road networks across the country including the ones leading to the new Federal Capital Abuja. Others notable road networks constructed include: Badagry-Sokoto, Lagos-Kano, Port Harcourt-Enugu, Kano-Bauchi, Warri-Okene, Abuja-Kaduna, Calabar-Ikom, Yola-Maiduguri, Mokwa-Bidda, Abuja-Keffi, Effurun-Patani-Kaiama, Jibia-Katsina, Kano-Kari and Potiskum-Maiduguri.

Shagari also built and improved some seaports including Sapele Ports Complex and started Federal Ocean Terminal in Port Harcourt. Inland ports were also built and modernized and a new river port was commissioned at Onitsha and another modern river port to serve the Ajaokuta Steel Mill.

In aviation, Shagari created the Ministry of Aviation and built three airports in Minna, Bauchi and Akure. New passenger aircraft were also acquired for Nigerian Airways including eight Boeing 737s and four Airbus A310s during which Nigeria had the largest airline network in Africa.

=== Finances ===
The fall in oil prices that began in 1981 affected the finances of the Nigerian government. Shagari &quot;refused to embrace&quot; structural adjustment from the IMF and World Bank as the crisis progressed, and initiated an Economic Stabilization Program to help protect the country against a hard landing from prior highs of the 1970s and to steer the economy towards positive growth. The key objectives of the program were to limit import licenses, reduce government spending, and raise custom duties. However, the result of the stabilization program was minimal.

=== Corruption ===
Even though Shehu Shagari was exonerated from personally being involved in corrupt practices, the Second Republic was plagued by allegations of corruption, including allegations of electoral fraud in the 1983 election. This, coupled with a decline in world oil prices, and a deterioration in the national finances, hardship, leading to the regime becoming deeply unpopular with citizens.

However, before removal from office, in his second term, Shagari made attempts to curb corruption through the new Ministry of National Guidance under Yusuf Maitama Sule, which was solely created for that purpose. A new program was introduced called Ethical Revolution which has the famous War Against Indiscipline which was launched under Gen. Muhammadu Buhari among its Initiatives. The ministry only lasted for three months before the 1983 coup. In his short lived second term, Shagari retained only 7 of the 45 ministers from the previous administration to demonstrate his commitment in fighting corruption. However, that did not convince the military junta which took over.

===In government===

Shagari&#x27;s government has recorded a number of successes in education. In his four-year term, there was a dramatic improvement in secondary schools and teachers in teaching colleges multiplied. In 1981 a mass literacy campaign was launched, and in 1982 a 6–3–3–5 system of education was introduced. Shagari&#x27;s government also built several tertiary institutions in Nigeria. New universities of technology where established in Bauchi, Benue, Adamawa, Ondo, Imo, and Osun States. They are the Federal University of Technology Yola; Federal University of Technology Akure; Federal University of Technology Owerri; Federal University of Technology Minna; Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; and Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University. Shagari&#x27;s administration also upgraded seven other existing colleges of education to degree-awarding institutions in Abraka, Ondo, Kano, Ado Ekiti, Bidda, Port Harcourt, and Zaria and also established eight other federal polytechnics in Ado Ekiti, Bidda, Bauchi, Idah, Uwana (Afikpo), Yola and Ilaro. The Federal Open University of Nigeria was also established during the end of Shagari&#x27;s administration in 1981. It also offered scholarships for students who are studying abroad.

The Shagari presidency will be remembered for his giant strides in encouraging women and youth in nation-building. On assumption to office, he gave directives to States to provide at least woman and one youth out of the seven nominees. During his campaign, he selected a woman from Imo State as his running mate, to be his vice president. However, she declined after previously accepting, due to a lack of support from stakeholders in Southern Eastern Nigeria where the vice presidential ticket was zoned to, it was the closest Nigerian women have ever been to the presidency. Nevertheless, the first female ministers and diplomats in Nigeria were appointed by Shagari. He appointed Ebun Oyagbola as Minister of National Planning and later Ambassador to the United Mexican States of Panama, Costa Rica and Guatemalan and Mrs. Janet Akinrinade as State Minister of Internal Affairs and two other female ministers Mrs. Asinobi and Mrs. Ivasi. Similarly, Mrs. Elizabeth Ogbon was appointed Consul General to Hamburg Germany, Mrs. R Mohammed was Nigeria Ambassador to Botswana and Zimbabwe.
Whereas, several young people had joined Shagari&#x27;s government and ministers and advisers. One of the famous ones is Prof. Pat Utomi, who was 29 when he was appointed Economic Adviser. Ministers appointed in their early 30s are Audu Innocent Ogbeh (32) and Bello Maitama Yusuf (34). Many of the cabinet ministers were below 50 years of age.

===National affairs===
Military development

The one-year term Shagari administration saw a rapid growth of the capacity of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Nigeria acquired most of its sophisticated weapons during this time until the recent upgrades and acquisitions. The military procurement under Shagari remains the highest in Nigeria&#x27;s history. They include the alpha Fighter Jets, the MIG Fighter Jets, 3 C-130H-30 Hercules transport aircraft, helicopter gunships among others. NNS Aradu (F89) which is the most sophisticated ship of the Nigeria Navy was acquired during his time.

====Maitatsine and Kano 1980 riot====

The Kano 1980 riot was a riot in Kano, Nigeria, led by Maitatsine, a heretical preacher, and his followers. It was the first major religious conflict in post-colonial Kano. Over 4,177 civilians, 100 policemen and about 35 military personnel were killed, including Maitatsine himself, and is generally regarded as marking the beginning of the Yan Tatsine. Because of this, there was widespread impression that Nigeria&#x27;s security and economy was threatened by illegal aliens and this belief was fueled by the fact that other West African nationals had aided in armed robberies. Illegal aliens from Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Mali and Burkina Faso along with over 6,000 Nigerian Muslim fanatics killed over 100 policemen while injuring 100 policemen. The army was called and alleviated the situation before the fanatics could overrun the country. However, official sources state that illegal aliens did not cause the trouble.

====Deportation of migrants====

In 1983, Shagari issued an executive order mandating immigrants without proper immigration documents to leave the country or they would be arrested according to the law. The order was in alleged response to the religious disturbances that had engulfed parts of the country in 1980 (Kano 1980 Riots) and 1981. Most of the immigrants were West Africans and mainly Ghanaians. Over 2 million men, women and children were affected.

====Federal Capital Territory====
Prior to Shagari&#x27;s presidency, Abuja was merely a virgin land with no development. Shehu Shagari laid the first infrastructure of the new city, the first of which is the road from Suleja to the site of the capital. Other infrastructures include electricity, waters, and roads.

The Usman Dam was built in 1980, which was mean to meet the water needs of the future city. The city was also connected to the national grid during that time. A new airport runway was also put in place which is now improved and upgraded as Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport. Other infrastructures include 5,000 housing for federal workers, a statehouse secretariate and a presidential guest house (Aguda House), Statehouse, National Assembly and National Mosques were also being built, 3 five star hotels, schools, hospitals, other constructions and some major road to into the city were in the works during the Shagari administration.

By 1983, Abuja had already become a functional city that council meetings and national celebrations were held there. When Shagari was removed, he was away in the city for a vacation. Abuja has since become a megacity and is now Nigeria Federal Capital Territory. Abuja was described as &quot;The Single Most Ambitious Urban Design Project of the 20th Century&quot; by a renowned architect Nnamdi Elleh.

===Foreign affairs===

Shagari&#x27;s presidency maintained Nigeria&#x27;s foreign policy since 1960, which was centred on Africa. Shagari himself was not new to foreign relations as he has led several Nigerian delegations to foreign missions since independence. His presidency advocated and acted rigorously against apartheid in South African and white minority rule in Zambia and Zimbabwe. The liberation struggle was a task to be carried out by the Shagari presidency. He has severally made his position known everywhere he was including during his state visits to the United Kingdom and the United States where President Jimmy Carter had congratulated him on the independence of Zimbabwe. Correspondence between President Shagari and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher shows that he has put so much pressure on Britain concerning the independence of Zimbabwe to the extent of risking the relationship between both countries.

In 1980, during Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence celebration, President Shagari pledged $15 million at the celebration to train Zimbabweans in Zimbabwe and expatriates in Nigeria. Mugabe&#x27;s government used part of the money to buy newspaper companies owned by South Africans, increasing the government&#x27;s control over the media. The rest went to training students in Nigerian universities, government workers in the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria in Badagry, and soldiers in the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna. Later that year Mugabe commissioned a report by the BBC on press freedom in Zimbabwe. The BBC issued its report on 26 June, recommending the privatization of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and its independence from political interests.

Shagari also made attempts to create ties between Nigeria and African Americans during his visits to the United States. At Harlem where he first visited and hosted a dinner for black leaders, he called for the need for economic ties with African Americans. However, after the 1980 U.S. General Election which brought in President Ronald Reagan, Nigeria/US relationship got to a low especially during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott which Nigeria refused to be part of. President Shagari insisted on maintaining Nigeria&#x27;s non-alignment policy and took part in the Russian Olympics despite lobby by the Carter Administration which sent the famous boxer Mohammed Ali to Nigeria. Shagari refused to see Mohammed Ali during his lobby tour.

Nigeria had border disputes with Chad and Cameroun which nearly led to war situation but which Shagari cautiously avoided. Shagari&#x27;s government was a great supporter of ECOWAS and allotted a plot for the building of its headquarters in Abuja. But despite Shagari&#x27;s government making peace with its neighbors, it exiled undocumented immigrants who were mostly Ghanaians in 1983. Even though popular with Nigerians, the action was widely criticized by commentators. It is known as Ghana Must Go, the Deportation of West African migrants from Nigeria.

== End of the Second Republic ==

Shagari ran for a second four-year term in 1983 and won the general election before later being overthrown and arrested by General Muhammadu Buhari in a military coup on 31 December 1983.

== Personal life ==

===Death===
On 28 December 2018 at about 6:30pm, Shehu Shagari died from a brief illness at the National Hospital, Abuja, where he was admitted to and undergoing treatment before his death. It was confirmed by his grandson Bello Bala Shagari and Governor Tambuwal in similar tweets at the time of his death.

=== Marriages ===
Shehu Shagari married three wives: Amina, Aisha, and Hadiza Shagari. He had several children, including Muhammad Bala Shagari and Aminu Shehu Shagari. On 24 August 2001, Aisha died in a London hospital following a brief illness. She was 49. Hadiza died at the age of 80 from COVID-19 complications in Abuja on 12 August 2021.

<text>Pawlu &quot;Paul&quot; Xuereb (21 July 1923 – 6 September 1994) was a Maltese politician who served as the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Malta from July 1986 to February 1987 and the acting president of Malta from February 1987 to April 1989.

He was educated at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London, where he studied journalism, Political Economy and Political Science. Upon completing his studies he returned to Malta in 1950 and took up the post of managing director of Fardex Trade Development Company (Malta) Ltd. In 1958 he joined the Department of Education as a visiting Master at the Lyceum. In 1959 Xuereb joined the Freedom Press as Literary Editor and Assistant Editor of the Malta Labour Party organ &quot;The Voice of Malta&quot; until 1964 when he was appointed General Manager of the Party publishing house. He entered politics in 1962, and contested the general election of that year when he was elected as Member of Parliament keeping his seat in the 1966, 1971, 1976 and 1981 elections. He was a Cabinet Minister between 1971 and 1976.

Xuereb was appointed by the Prime Minister as the Acting President of the Republic, following the end of term of Office of the third President, Agatha Barbara. Xuereb took the Oath of Office on 16 February 1987. A bronze statue designed by late sculptor Anton Agius was erected within Howards&#x27; Gardens, just outside the Bastions of Mdina in Paul Xuereb&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="551104" wikidata="Q5199263" url="?curid=551104" title="Cylinder 1024">
<text>Cylinder 1024 is the first cylinder of a hard disk that was inaccessible in the original IBM PC compatible hardware specification, interrupt 13h, which uses cylinder-head-sector addressing. At boot time, the BIOS of many very old PCs could only access the first 1024 cylinders, numbered 0 to 1023, as the specific CHS addressing used by the BIOS interrupt 13 API only defines 10 bits for the cylinder count (2^10=1024).

This was a problem for operating systems on the x86 platform as the BIOS must be able to load the bootloader and the entire kernel image into memory. Both of these must, therefore, be located on the first 1024 cylinders of the disk.

Older versions of Microsoft Windows resolved this by necessitating that the operating system was installed to the first partition. Partly because of this bug, users of the Linux operating system have traditionally created a partition to reside within the first 1024 cylinders of the disk, containing little more than the kernel and bootloader.

<text>Alfred Bitini Xuma, OLG, commonly referred to by his initials as AB Xuma (8 March 1893 – 27 January 1962), was the first black South African to become a medical doctor, as well as a leader, activist and president-general of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1940 to 1949. He was a member of the African American founded Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Life==
Although on the left wing of the ANC, Xuma was seen during his leadership as too conservative by an increasingly impatient and activist youth, which he regarded in turn with suspicion. (His letters to colleagues are understood to be full of hostile references to communists.) As such, he was widely regarded as out of touch with the needs and demands of the grassroots.

Nevertheless, it was under his leadership, albeit after having been very cannily lobbied, and in spite of warnings from his colleagues that it would lead to his downfall, that the ANC in 1942 established its Youth League.

A young Nelson Mandela was among the activists present (including Walter Sisulu, Congress Mbata, and William Nkomo) who in 1944 visited his home in Sophiatown to agitate for his acceptance of the league&#x27;s manifesto and draft constitution. Mandela recalls having been impressed at how &quot;grand&quot; Xuma&#x27;s house was, as well as by his revitalisation of the ANC: Xuma had succeeded in regularising membership and subscriptions, and had greatly improved the movement&#x27;s finances. To Mandela, however, and many other young Africans of the time,

he represented the old way of doing things: deputations, statements, committees—gentlemen politics in the British tradition. As a man so recently being groomed to become a &#x27;black Englishman&#x27; himself, Mandela understood how all that worked. But now there were new voices around him, offering an increasing militant approach.

Xuma responded very angrily and sarcastically after reading what he called their &quot;high-learned&quot; manifesto, which explicitly criticized the ANC&#x27;s failure to advance the national cause, as well as its deficiencies in organisation and constitution, and its &quot;erratic policy of yielding to oppression, regarding itself as a body of gentlemen with clean hands.&quot; Xuma rounded on the deputation for usurping the authority of the ANC national executive, but refrained from criticizing publicly a cause he had publicly championed. Thus outmaneuvered, he gave the ANC Youth League his blessing, having secured an agreement that the ANC itself would remain the dominant body

==Legacy==
After his death his book collection was given to Orlando East Public Library by his widow, Madie Hall Xuma. This library was the first purpose built public library in Soweto.

His home currently serves as the Sophiatown Heritage and Cultural Centre.

<text>Maria da Graça Xuxa Meneghel ( , ; born Maria da Graça Meneghel on 27 March 1963) is a Brazilian TV host, actress, singer, and businesswoman. Nicknamed &quot;The Queen of Children&quot;, Xuxa built the largest Latin and South American children&#x27;s entertainment empire. In the early 1990s, she presented television programs in Brazil, Argentina, Spain and the United States simultaneously, reaching around 100 million viewers daily. Xuxa has sold over 30 million copies of her records worldwide, which makes her the highest-selling Brazilian female singer. Her net worth was estimated at US$100 million in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://articles.baltimoresun.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also successful as a businesswoman, she has the highest net worth of any Brazilian female entertainer, estimated at US$400 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Maria da Graça Meneghel was born in Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, to Alda () and Luís Floriano Meneghel. Xuxa is of Italian and Polish descent by paternal side and of German, Swiss and Portuguese descent by maternal side. Her paternal great-grandfather emigrated to Brazil from the northern Italian town of Imer, in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, in the end of the 19th century. In 2013, Xuxa obtained Italian citizenship by &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;.

During Xuxa&#x27;s birth, her father was told that both mother and child were at risk. He opted to save his wife, and prayed to Our Lady of Graces, promising to name his daughter after the Blessed Virgin Mary if all went well. Although she was named for the Virgin as promised, Xuxa, the youngest member of the Meneghel family, received her famous nickname from her brother, Bladimir. When their mother arrived home with the baby, she said to him: &quot;Look at the baby that I bought to play with you,&quot; he replied: &quot;I know, it&#x27;s my Xuxa.&quot; The nickname stuck, though it was not until 1988 that she officially changed her name to Maria da Graça Xuxa Meneghel.

Xuxa spent her early years in her hometown Santa Rosa. When she was seven, she and her family moved to Rio de Janeiro where they lived in the Bento Ribeiro neighborhood.

At 15 years old, she was discovered by a modeling agency, and began her professional career as a model at 16. During this time period Xuxa modeled in Brazil and the United States for both fashion and men&#x27;s magazines, such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, and began an affair with Brazilian retired footballer Pelé. In 1984, she was hired as a model by Ford Models.

== Career ==
=== 1983–1986: Rede Manchete ===
Xuxa started a career in television through an offer to host a small regional children&#x27;s program, &quot;Clube da Criança&quot; for Rede Manchete. In this period, she worked as a model during the week in New York City and taped her show during the weekend in Brazil. In 1986 this opportunity was expanded when she received an offer to host a national children&#x27;s program through the multimedia conglomerate Globo.

=== 1986–1992: &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot; and breakthrough ===
On 30 June 1986, &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot; debuted on TV Globo. It aired in the mornings from Monday to Saturday until its final episode on 31 December 1992, after some 2,000 episodes. Xuxa would usually enter on a pink ship, which awakened in the children the dream of flying beside her. Children from all over Brazil ran to have breakfast with the song &quot;Quem Qué Pão?&quot; She would end the show with the famous &quot;Xuxa kiss&quot;, where she would put on bright lipstick and kiss the children onstage with her and children in the audience on the cheek, leaving a mark. In addition to entertainment, she also aired positive messages to the public, such as &quot;Want, Power and Reach!&quot;, &quot;Believe in Dreams&quot; and &quot;Drugs do Bad&quot;. In Christmas 1986, Xuxa received her eighth platinum record, a prize awarded to every 250,000 copies sold. The album &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot;, from the record company Som Livre, had sold more than two million copies, achieving by then the South American record for a single album. Xuxa sold more than Brazilian singer Roberto Carlos that year. In the following years, the presenter still released six more albums of the series, such as &quot;Xou da Xuxa 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, which established themselves as the best-selling albums in Brazil, with 2.7 and 3.3 million copies sold, respectively. With the recorded songs, it left in tours by Brazil that were seen by millions of people.
In 1987, the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; included Xuxa in the list of 10 women of prominence on the planet, next to the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. In the same period, Xuxa began a relationship with the Brazilian Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, who died in 1994. In parallel to the &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot;, the presenter commanded &quot;Bobeou Dançou&quot;, between 9 July and 31 December 1989, on Sunday afternoons of TV Globo. Initially created as &quot;Xou of Xuxa&quot; frame, it was so successful that the station decided to launch it as an independent program aimed at the adolescent public. The &quot;Bobeou Dançou&quot; was a program of rumba based on riddles with two teams formed by adolescents between 13 and 17 years disputed the first place of the competition.

In 1990, the film &quot;Lua de Cristal&quot;, Xuxa&#x27;s biggest box office hit, sold 4,178 million tickets and ranked 21st in the ranking of most-watched national films from 1970 to 2011 according to Ancine (&quot;Agência Nacional do Cinema&quot;). Xuxa accumulated the highest-grossing of Brazilian cinema, with more than 37 million people watched her films. She was also chosen by the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences of the United States to deliver the International Emmy Awards in the category of best children&#x27;s program and present one of their songs in the awards party. In 1991, Xuxa appeared in 37th place for &quot;Forbes&quot; among the 40 richest celebrities of that year, with a turnover of $19 million. Xuxa was the first Brazilian to join the list. The &quot;Paradão da Xuxa&quot; emerged as an independent program after the success of the picture of the same name presented in &quot;Xou of Xuxa&quot;. The program was aired between 25 April and 26 December 1992 on Saturday mornings of TV Globo, replacing &quot;Xou of Xuxa&quot; on that day. The program was three hours long, and different singers and musical groups performed on the show. The musical selection went from the samba to the rock, going through the sertanejo music. On the last Saturday of each month, &quot;Super Paradão&quot; (Vacation Specials) was shown, highlighting the most successful songs of the period.

=== 1991–1993: International career ===
After reaching success with her record sales in Brazil, Xuxa released her first Spanish-language album, &quot;Xuxa 1&quot;, which performed well in the Argentine market. Xuxa widened her appeal among Spanish-speaking audiences when she recorded a program in Argentina, called &quot;El Show de Xuxa&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported in 1992 that &quot;more than 20 million Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking children watched &quot;El Show de Xuxa&quot; in 16 countries of Latin America every day, as well as Univision in the United States. The first two seasons of the show, the most popular, were produced by Argentine TV channel Telefé while the third season, in 1993, was produced independently and then sold for broadcast to El Trece. Her last Spanish speaking show aired in Latin America on 31 December 1993.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; highlighted her success in Brazil and Argentina in an article by correspondent James Brooke. The publication highlighted the record sales of albums of the singer, which in 1990 reached 12 million copies, and its success in the Hispanic market, where it reached 300,000 copies with their first album in Spanish. At the time, she was called by &quot;New York&quot; magazine as &quot;Latin American Madonna&quot;. In 1992, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that Xuxa was &quot;probably better known to most Latin American pre-adolescents than Michael Jackson.&quot; In 1992, taping programs in Brazil and Argentina, Xuxa was invited to host the program &quot;Xuxa Park&quot; in Spain. Released by Telecinco channel, the game show was shown on Sundays, with high ratings, and lasted two years. Her &quot;Xuxa Park&quot; album sold well for 8 weeks and was certified gold. &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; published in September 1992, that the album &quot;Xuxa 2&quot; was at the top of the Spanish charts, and appeared in position 77 of the 100 most sold albums in the world. The biggest hits on this disc were: &quot;Loquita Por Ti&quot; (#29 on the billboard chart), &quot;Luna de Cristal&quot; (#35 on the billboard chart) and &quot;Chindolele&quot; (#10 on the billboard chart). The album reached the fifth position in the U.S. &quot;Billboard Top Latin Albums&quot; of 1991. In 1992, &quot;People&quot; magazine chose Xuxa as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.

In 1993, Xuxa hosted an English-language series in the United States titled &quot;Xuxa&quot; (which was produced by MTM Enterprises). However, it did not achieve the popularity she had enjoyed throughout Brazil, Latin America and Spain, and was cancelled after one season due to low ratings. It was initially broadcast by 124 stations across the country. The shows were produced on Sound Stage 36 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Sixty-five episodes were taped for the first season of the show. Taping of the episodes was done in a 5-week period in the summer of 1993. The shows were broadcast Monday through Friday, generally in the early morning or mid-afternoon. All 65 episodes were broadcast during the initial 13 weeks before there was a repeat. Helping Xuxa on the show were the Pixies (three U.S. &quot;Paquitas&quot; plus one Brazilian Paquita), the Mellizas (uncredited), Jelly, Jam, and ten &quot;child wranglers&quot; for 150 kids on the set. Starting in September 1994, Xuxa began airing on The Family Channel cable network, at 8:00 am ET/PT. They reprised original episodes on a new children&#x27;s block until 19 February 1996 when Xuxa stopped airing on The Family Channel. The show was sold to other countries including Japan, Israel, Russia, Australia, Romania and some Arab states. Her international ambitions apparently ended after the grueling taping schedule for her American show. She was hospitalized for several days due to exhaustion, and decided to give up her international career. In the U.S., Sony Wonder released two of her videos and a record that includes English translations of some of her most successful songs in Portuguese and Spanish.

=== 1994–2000: Weekend shows ===
The presenter returned to her children&#x27;s audience with &quot;Xuxa Park&quot;, the Brazilian version of a project of the same name that commanded in Spain. Xuxa&#x27;s triumphant entrances continued, in one of the stages, she stepped out of a pyramid. In the last segment of the program, Xuxa arrived in her iconic spaceship. The program directed by Marlene Mattos gathered pictures, jokes and musical attractions was exhibited between 4 June 1994 and 6 January 2001 on Saturday mornings of TV Globo. The attraction was canceled abruptly due to a fire that occurred on 11 January 2001 in the recording of its carnival special.

In parallel to &quot;Xuxa Park&quot;, Xuxa commanded &quot;Xuxa Hits&quot; between 8 January and 16 April 1995 on Sunday afternoons on TV Globo. The program came as a picture of &quot;Xuxa Park&quot;, but became an independent program due to its great success. In attraction, Xuxa received several musical attractions like bands, DJs and singers. After its end, the program returned to be only a painting of the &quot;Xuxa Park&quot;.

Inspired by &quot;Xuxa Hits&quot;, the &quot;Planeta Xuxa&quot; was created, and premiered on 5 April 1997. Initially, &quot;Planeta Xuxa&quot; was shown on TV Globo&#x27;s Saturday afternoons, so Xuxa presented two shows simultaneously on the same day, as Xuxa Park occupied the broadcasters&#x27; mornings. From 19 April 1998, the program began to be presented on Sunday afternoons due to the 1998 World Cup, remaining on Sundays until its end in 2002. &quot;Planeta Xuxa&quot; was focused on the performances of musicians and bands. The program had the format of a discoteque, had the participation of the public and received famous guests. The attraction came to an end on 28 July 2002, due to Xuxa&#x27;s desire to return to children&#x27;s television and the end of the partnership with director Marlene Mattos.

=== 2001–2014: &quot;Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação&quot; and &quot;TV Xuxa&quot; ===

As a mother, Xuxa noticed a shortage of videos for small children. In 2001, she designed the &quot;Só Para Baixinhos&quot; audiovisual and the CD and DVD set. The album &quot;Só Para Baixinhos 2&quot; received worldwide recognition and won the 2002 Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Children&#x27;s Album category. With the success of the Xuxa project for &quot;Baixinhos&quot;, which was aimed at children 0–10 years old, the presenter had the desire to create a program in this educational mold, and on 28 October 2002 she debuted &quot;Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação&quot;. The show was broadcast on Monday mornings of TV Globo, marking the return of the presenter the broad daily of the station after the end of &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot;. The attraction, about 40 minutes long, was divided into four blocks and had 32 frames displayed alternately throughout the week. Through computer graphics capabilities, Xuxa appeared seated on a globe with a blue background filled with white clouds, and featured 14 pictures that blended entertainment and didactic elements. After many reformulations to reverse the low audience, the program came to an end on 31 December 2004. In 2003, Xuxa was nominated again to Grammy for &quot;Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 3&quot; and took the second trophy in the same category. On 30 June 2003, she inaugurated an amusement park with her name. &quot;Mundo de Xuxa&quot;, located in São Paulo, in an area of 12,000 square meters, was the largest indoor amusement park in Latin America and has more than 18 attractions. The &quot;Mundo do Xuxa&quot; is part of the group of 3 amusement parks that most invoice in Brazil, together the 3 parks made about R$220 million per year. In 2004, for the third consecutive time, she competed with the video &quot;Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 4&quot; in the same category. The 5th edition, &quot;Xuxa Circus&quot;, became a huge-selling success and was transformed into a show that dragged crowds into theaters. In 2005, the &quot;Xuxa Festa&quot;, promoted a remix of old hits. The project pleased both the children and the parents who grew up following her career. In 2012, Xuxa is again present in the Latin Grammy as the only Brazilian in the Best Children&#x27;s Album category, with &quot;XSPB 11&quot;. This is already the fifth indication of the &quot;Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos&quot; series.
After successive audience defeats with &quot;Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação&quot;, TV Globo reformulated again the attraction commanded by Xuxa that changed its name and age group and on 4 April 2005, it premiered &quot;TV Xuxa&quot;. The program had two distinct phases and the first was broadcast on Monday morning to the children&#x27;s audience in a mix of play, dramaturgy, competition, cartoons and musical numbers presentation. The name of the program was an allusion to the fictional &quot;TV Xuxa&quot;, a television station with several attractions. After many changes for not being able to keep the station in the isolated leadership, the program no longer aired on 31 December 2007. With the success of XSPB, Xuxa released in Argentina, in 2005, the Xuxa audiovisual &quot;Solamente para Bajitos&quot;. In parallel to &quot;TV Xuxa&quot;, the presenter commanded &quot;Conexão Xuxa&quot; between 2 December 2007 and 11 January 2008. The program had four teams formed by three people (one athlete, one personality and one teenager). Together, they faced various kinds of physical evidence and general knowledge in beautiful settings in the country. The program lasted three stages. The teams were divided by colors: yellow, green, blue and orange. The four teams disputed an X of gold, that was worth three points; an X of silver, worth two; or a bronze X, which was worth one point. In all, there were three stages, displayed in seven editions. The two winners of the first stage and the two winners of the second disputed the final of the program. Vencia the group that obtains more points throughout the competition. &quot;TV Xuxa&quot; returned to TV Globo grid on 10 May 2008, totally refurbished, aimed at the whole family. With new format and schedule, and different attractions, it became a weekly auditorium program, screened on Saturdays at 10 am. The show ceased to show cartoons, invested in jokes, and Xuxa went on to receive her guests on a stage designed for interviews and musical numbers. In 2009 Xuxa released the film &quot;Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha&quot;, telling what happens to the princesses after the &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;. The film starred Sasha Meneghel in theaters and featured the participation of Hebe Camargo, Luciano Szafir, Luciano Huck, Angelica and others. The film took more than 1,300,000 people to the movies and was released in Brazil, the United States and Angola. In the musical career, Xuxa left to Som Livre, signing with Sony Music. It is estimated that the contract value was R$10 million. Xuxa released the 9th title of the &quot;Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos&quot; series, titled &quot;Natal Mágico&quot; and in 2010 the tenth edition of XSPB, entitled &quot;Baixinhos, Bichinhos e Mais&quot;, the album sold, in one month, the amount necessary to become the best-selling DVD of 2010 in Brazil. In October 2010 Xuxa gave an interview explaining its break with &quot;Free Sound&quot; the presenter claimed that her then record company, was providing a tight budget for the size of its projects. Also in 2010, Xuxa was chosen as favourite Brazilian singer by the readers of the Argentine newspaper &quot;Clarín&quot;.
In April 2011, she launched &quot;Mundo da Xuxa&quot; program on TV Globo Internacional. The attraction was shown to Brazilian subscribers on every continent from Monday to Friday and shows the best moments of her career on Globo, as well as clips from XSPB. With success in the mornings, the program &quot;TV Xuxa&quot; was transferred to the afternoons of Saturday in 2011, replacing the Session of Saturday, that suffered to leave the transmitter in the isolated leadership. &quot;TV Xuxa&quot; finally came to an end on 25 January 2014, due to the health problems of the presenter. In May 2014, after five years in Sony Music, Xuxa returned to Som Livre. In a press release, the label corrected one of the main mistakes in the company&#x27;s history: &quot;not to keep one of the country&#x27;s greatest artists.&quot;

=== 2015–present: TV Globo exit and new phase ===
On 5 March 2015, after 29 years with TV Globo and off air for over a year with the end of &quot;TV Xuxa&quot;, Xuxa signed on with Rede Record. Xuxa and TV Globo had amicably broken their contract in December 2014. The arrival of Xuxa in the headquarters of the station was transmitted live by the &quot;Program of the Tarde&quot;, the station organized one of the biggest events of its history with several links with the fans in the door of its headquarters, in São Paulo, the movement of the employees and the signing of a contract with the presence of the high dome of the broadcaster and journalists of various media, at a press conference specially set up for the blonde at the Teatro Record. This was considered one of the biggest signings in the history of the transmitter, according to sites specialized in TV.

The presenter premiered &quot;Xuxa Meneghel&quot;, a show of the same name, on 17 August 2015 on RecordTV&#x27;s Monday night. The program, screened directly from RecNov, was inspired by &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, and blended humor, music, interviews, games and special features. The attraction also opened space for the viewer to interact through social networks. Its last episode aired on 19 December 2016.

After having its release postponed several times, Som Livre launched in December 2016, the thirteenth volume of &quot;Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos&quot;. Recorded in 2014, and expected to be released in September 2016, XPSB 13 earned Xuxa a Latin Grammy nomination, but because it was released after the deadline, it was disqualified by the Latin Recording Academy.

On 3 April 2017, Xuxa debuted the program &quot;Dancing Brasil&quot;, a Brazilian version of the American program Dancing with the Stars, produced by Endemol Shine and shown by RecordTV.

Recently, Xuxa announced the national launch of their new tour of shows, titled &quot;XuChá&quot;, and based on the traditional tea &quot;Chá da Alice&quot;.

On 6 February 2019, Xuxa also debuted the program &quot;The Four Brasil&quot;, a Brazilian version of the American program &quot;The Four&quot;, also produced by the Endemol Shine Group and also shown by RecordTV.

On 2023, Globoplay released a documentary about her called &quot;Xuxa, o Documentário&quot;.

== Career in music ==
In 1986, the album &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot;, sold over two million copies, breaking the South American record for sales, earning eight platinum awards (granted every 250,000 copies sold). In the following years, Xuxa launched six discs, including &quot;Xegundo Xou da Xuxa&quot; and &quot;Xou da Xuxa 3&quot;, and recorded two LPs with the songs translated into Spanish, which sold 2.4 million copies. Xuxa even recorded songs in English, but was never officially released.

From 1989 to 1996, Xuxa had sold 18 million albums, a record in Latin American music sales. Xuxa recorded about 915 songs, recorded 28 albums that together have sold over 45 million copies, and were awarded 400 gold records in Brazil. The album, &quot;Xou da Xuxa 3,&quot; had more than 3,216,000 copies sold, making it the best-selling children&#x27;s album, according to the Guinness Book.

In 2002, &quot;Veja&quot; magazine named Xuxa the richest artist in Brazil, with an estimated net worth of $250 million. According to the same magazine, Xuxa&#x27;s earnings were comparable to Hollywood stars like Julia Roberts and Keanu Reeves. She was first in the list of artists with highest sales over the past ten years (1998–2008).

The music video, &quot;Xuxa só para Baixinhos&quot; sold over eight million copies, and won five nominations and two Latin Grammy awards for &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Album&quot;.

In 2012, the Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos (ABPF) released the list of the best-selling DVDs in the country. According to ABPD, Xuxa had two DVDs among the top ten in 2011, XSPB Volume 1–8 (sixth place) and XSPB 11 (ninth).

== Social activism ==


In September 2011, Colombian singer, Shakira, and Xuxa joined forces through their respective charitable foundations to aid children younger than six years old who live in Brazil&#x27;s poorest communities. The two artists, together with Brazilian government officials, signed an accord in Rio de Janeiro for a program of cooperation. In its first four years, it plans to provide better access to education to children from 100 schools in Brazil.

Xuxa supports the campaign &quot;Tri-national to Combat Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents&quot; which aims to encourage people to report cases of exploitation and abuse of minors living on the border between Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. Since May 2013, the campaign has integrated the actions of several groups: the Itaipu Dam, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Municipal Tourism Council, Childhood and Youth, Ministry of Labor and Employment, and entities of Paraguay and Argentina who work in the same area.

In May 2014, then-President Dilma Rousseff signed a law that applied stronger penalties to the crime of sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. On 4 June 2014, Xuxa was present when the Senate of Brazil passed the &quot;&quot; (PLC 58/2014) that prohibits the use of violence in the education of children and adolescents, which had been adopted by the Commission on Human Rights of the Chamber of Deputies. When asked about criticism from some parents about how they will educate their children after the passage of this law, Xuxa said that they can educate, but without violence: &quot;We have to show that people can and should educate without violence&quot;. Xuxa said that the project should be called &quot;Lei Menino Bernardo&quot; in honor of , an 11-year-old boy killed in April that year.

== Personal life ==
===Fortune and investments===
At the age of 16, Xuxa began to model professionally. Years later, an affair with soccer player Pelé boosted her profile and in 1982 Xuxa already was considered one of the most recognizable public figures in the country, endorsing everything from underwear to residential buildings. In the same year she landed a supporting role in the soap opera &quot;Elas por Elas&quot; at Globo TV and over time had more roles in telenovelas.

Also in 1982 Xuxa founded her first company, Xuxa Produções, a legal entity that takes care of the Xuxa brand and holds, exclusively, the rights to commercialize the use of the brand and image of the artist, both nationally and internationally. The company also represents Xuxa in any and all contracts. Additionally, the company has represented other interests as well, and in 1993 Xuxa Produções was responsible for bringing Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous World Tour&quot; to Brazil. The company was also involved in the co-production of films by Renato Aragão, Angelica and Father Marcelo Rossi.

Following her successful entry to &quot;Clube da Criança&quot;, the start of her modeling career on weekdays in New York City, and the release of her album &quot;Xuxa e Seus Amigos&quot; (which sold 500,000 copies in 1983), Xuxa was contracted by Globo TV and Som Livre. In the same year Xuxa founded the brand &quot;O Bicho Comeu&quot;, responsible for the commercialization of clothes and accessories for children.

After an initial salary at Globo TV of US$40,000, Xuxa saw several salary increases, which in 1987 had already reached one million dollars. Also in 1987 she founded &quot;Beijinho Beijinho Produções&quot;, responsible for the co-production of television programs and albums. Until 1988, the companies of Xuxa were run by her parents and brothers Cirano, Bladimir, and Solange. That year, the director of Xuxa&#x27;s program, Marlene Mattos, and lawyer Luiz Cláudio Moreira took over her companies. The Xuxa film series premiered in theaters the same year with the film &quot;Super Xuxa contra Baixo Astral&quot;, which was seen by more than 2.8 million viewers. By this point, Xuxa&#x27;s fortune was over R$50 million. In 1989 Xuxa already shared with Hebe Camargo the title of highest-paid host of Latin America, receiving US$1.5 million monthly from Globo TV alone. In 1989, she bought the three million square meter &quot;MG Meneghel&quot; farm in Rio Bonito, Rio de Janeiro; the farm also had 50 mango trees and 200 dairy cattle. The activities of the Xuxa Meneghel Foundation, which carries out four social development programs (Program for Networks and Political Incidence, Program for Socio-educational Actions, Integrated Assistance Program, and the Institutional Partnerships Program) also began during that time.

In 1990 she founded the Xuxa International Corporation, based in the Cayman Islands, a well-known tax haven, which was responsible for collecting royalties from Xuxa&#x27;s international enterprises. Her royalties varied between 5% and 20% of the final profit from the sale of products licensed under her brand. Xuxa made a total profit of $19 million in 1990, resulting in her 37th appearance on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of &quot;Top 40 Most Enlightened Celebrities&quot; in 1991, the first Latin American to appear on the list. The magazine reported that her fortune had already surpassed that of Madonna and was equated with that of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Also in 1990, Xuxa bought a site in Vargem Grande, Rio de Janeiro for US $2 million. The property underwent several renovations so that it could be Xuxa&#x27;s official residence, with a mini zoo and nursery, heated pool with waterfall, main house (1050 m2, two floors and five suites with closet), guest house (280 m2), Japanese restaurant (195 m2 bar, industrial kitchen and laundry), fitness center (196 m2), party room (540 m2), recording studio (60 m2), sauna (com 62 m2), employees&#x27; quarters (283 m2), caretaker&#x27;s quarters (63 m2), support cellar (67 m2), linen and storage (306 m2), garage for eight cars, and a helipad. With a total of 78,000 square meters, Xuxa traveled to the estate by golf cart. This home was a refuge for Xuxa, but that did not prevent fans sleeping in the entrance of the site waiting for her. The estate, called Casa Rosa, was a frequent sight in television programs and magazines, consequently becoming well-known in Brazilian pop culture, and coming to be known as the Brazilian &quot;Neverland&quot;. In 2007, with the concern of providing a more normal social life for her daughter Sasha, Xuxa put the site up for sale for $8 million. However, she has not yet been able to sell the property, which is still part of her equity. In 1990, Xuxa acquired an apartment of five million dollars in New York City, a property she still owns. She also took advantage of the opening of the Brazilian market to imported vehicles to found Shine Car, a concessionaire of imported luxury cars based in Rio de Janeiro. Through a partnership with Grendene, Xuxa sold 4 million sandals in Brazil, 1 million in the United States, 1 million in Mexico and 500,000 in the rest of Latin America in 1990 alone.

Between 1991 and 1992 Xuxa received $1 million a month for work on the Telefe for &quot;El Show de Xuxa&quot;. She launched the Xuxa Meneghel Models Course in Rio de Janeiro, with a duration of seven months and a load of six hours a week, and a tuition starting at $60. Also in 1991 Xuxa ramped up the licensing of products featuring her brand name. She bought five luxury apartments in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which earned her $200,000 in rent income.

In 1992 Xuxa signed a contract with the Spanish television network Telecinco for 15 episodes of the &quot;Xuxa Park&quot; program, receiving $240,000 per episode. Only TV Globo, Telefe and Telecinco Xuxa received more than $3.4 million monthly. In May 1992, Xuxa&#x27;s estate was estimated at US$100 million by &quot;People&quot;, making her the second-richest artist in Brazil until then, with the same patrimony of Roberto Carlos and behind Silvio Santos. In the same year she founded the Light Beam Corporation to license her brand exclusively in the United States, selling this year, among other products, 500,000 dolls of her own likeness. Xuxa made 12 advertising campaigns that year, earning $200,000 each. Xuxa made a final profit of $27 million in 1992, resulting in her return to the list of &quot;40 celebrities who grew richer in the last year&quot; by Forbes in 1993, this time in 28th place. Between 1986 and 1992 Xuxa had sold 18 million CDs, which had generated a revenue of over $175 million, of which 20% she kept. Xuxa&#x27;s Xuxa program produced four tours, including Xuxa&#x27;s Xuxa 89 tour, in which Xuxa&#x27;s cache was over $300,000, with a production roster of ten trucks, 60 flights, two wagons, and two 25-ton stages with more than 150 people involved.

In 1993 she premiered the &quot;Xuxa&quot; program in the United States, in English. The program was broadcast by more than 100 stations in the country, including CBS and Freeform, and was also sold to more than 120 countries. Through the program, Xuxa received $7 million and launched products in more than 100 countries. So that she could rest between the recordings of the show, Xuxa bought a mansion in Calabasas, Califórnia. In September 1999 the residence was bought by the singer and American actress Brandy Norwood, for $1.7 million. In the year of 1993 Xuxa handled $220 million only in licenses. At the end of this year, a problem in her spine caused her work to slow down. In 1994, the death of Ayrton Senna also contributed to Xuxa gradually diminishing her work rate. Later that year, she bought a mansion on Star Island in Miami for $15 million. The mansion had previously belonged to Madonna and is still owned by Xuxa today. A tourist boat ride titled &quot;The Rich and Famous Tour&quot;, includes the Xuxa mansion in the script. In present-day money, a mansion on the island has the minimum price of $65 million.

On her 33rd birthday she received a Ferrari F355 from her manager Marlene Matos. In 1996 they realized the tour &quot;Tô de Bem com a Vida&quot;, with more than 45 concerts and a cache of $350,000. In that same year the international press announced that Xuxa was concerned about having no private life. In October, she announced that she would soon leave her career to try to be a mother through artificial insemination, but that did not happen because Xuxa had to keep working in order to meet contractual deadlines. In November her fortune was estimated at $300 million. In 1996 she founded Lar&#x27;s Empreendimentos, an entity responsible for real estate investments and the creation of the &quot;O Mundo da Xuxa&quot; park in 2003.

In 2000 she acquired a million-dollar home in Celebration, Florida, near Walt Disney World. In 2005, an 11-year-old girl, the daughter of a friend of Xuxa, died at Disneyland while she was lodging in Xuxa&#x27;s house.

In 2002 Xuxa acquired four suites for R$13 million in São Conrado, in Rio de Janeiro. In 2008 part of the property caught fire while Xuxa, Sasha and Luciano Szafir were inside. Luciano was hospitalized after inhaling smoke. According to the magazine &quot;Veja&quot;, also in 2002, Xuxa had $250 million in equity referring only to real estate. The year 2002 was also marked by the professional breakup of Xuxa and Marlene Mattos, who left the command of Xuxa&#x27;s holding company by reducing her salary at Globo TV to $1 million a month, which lasted until her exit. Xuxa founded the company &quot;Espaço Laser&quot;, of which she holds a 51% share . The year ended with 200 licensed products and monthly sales of R$30 million.

In 2003, she bought the &quot;Gugu Park&quot; at the SP Market mall in São Paulo and transformed it into the Xuxa Mundo O Mundo amusement park. She bought the park for $15 million. The park made about R$10 million a year.

In 2007, when she left to live in &quot;Casa Rosa&quot;, Xuxa moved to a residence that had been built in the Malibu Condominium in Barra da Tijuca. The 1,700-square-meter, three-storey mansion is valued at R$10 million.

In 2009, Lar&#x27;s Empreendimentos was ordered to pay an indemnity of R$50,000 for moral and material damages in legal proceedings.

In November 2010 Xuxa did not agree to an increase in rent of the building which the Shine Car company occupied and took the landlord to court, but lost the action, ultimately vacating the property. Shine Car became defunct in January 2011. Also in January 2011 Xuxa won a $150,000 lawsuit against Folha Universal, which had stated in 2008 that the artist &quot;was Satanist and would have sold her soul to the devil for $100 million.&quot;

In 2012 Xuxa received R$2 million to participate in an advertising campaign of beauty products by the brand Wella, changing the color of her hair, becoming a brunette for the first time in her career. The $2 million was donated to the Xuxa Meneghel Foundation.

In 2013 TV Bandeirantes was ordered by the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) to pay an indemnity of 1.1 million reais to Xuxa. The STJ ruled that Xuxa appeared naked on the station&#x27;s show in 2008. The images had been published by Playboy before Xuxa launched herself as a children&#x27;s show host in the early 1980s. The STJ, therefore, rejected the request of the issuer to rediscuss the amount of compensation established by the Court of Justice of Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ) in 2011. Also in 2013 Xuxa bought an island in Angra dos Reis, for R$12.7 million.

In 2014 RecordTV was ordered to pay R$100,000 to Xuxa. The broadcaster was sued for broadcasting photos of her from a photoessay that appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; in the 1980s without authorization during the Gugu Liberato in 2012.

In February 2015, Xuxa refused a proposed renewal with Globo, since without any new projects, her salary would be reduced to R$250,000 compared to the $1 million she used to get. In the same month, &quot;O Mundo da Xuxa&quot; came to an end, since the attraction would have to go through new expansions in order to fill the space it was in. This was not viable due to the Brazilian economic crisis; the park had a final profit of R$4 million in 2014, against R$10 million in 2008. It was sold to Parque da Mônica for R$40 million. In March Xuxa signed with RecordTV for R$1 million monthly. If her program leaves the network, Xuxa will still receive $250,000 monthly. In that same year the Laser Space earned R$50 million. Xuxa, as a businesswoman, had a final profit of $160 million from her companies.

In 2016, Espaço Laser earned R$60 million, expanding its operations to 187 units in Brazil. Xuxa, as a businesswoman, made a final profit of R$200 million with her holding company in 2016. In the same year, she launched herself as a YouTuber.

Xuxa&#x27;s children&#x27;s party company, Casa X, earned R$17 million in 2017, a 50% increase in one year.

The equity of Xuxa and her companies is valued at US$1 billion, making her one of the richest women in Brazil. Xuxa is a vegan.

===Relationships and children===
Xuxa has one daughter with actor Luciano Szafir, Sasha, who was born in 1998. Xuxa dated Brazilian footballer Pelé in the 1980s, and later Formula 1 driver, Ayrton Senna.

She reported in 2012 that reclusive singer Michael Jackson had once courted her, inviting her to dinner at Neverland Ranch and his manager asked whether she would consider bearing his children. She is in a relationship with actor and singer Junno Andrade. In 2013, her Italian nationality was recognized.

<text>Muhammadu Buhari (; born 17 December 1942) is a Nigerian politician and retired Nigerian army major general who served as the president of Nigeria from 2015 to 2023. He was the military head of state from 31 December 1983 to 27 August 1985, succeeding Shehu Shagari following the 1983 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état.

Buhari ran for president of Nigeria on the platform and support of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2003 and 2007, and on the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) platform in 2011. In December 2014, he emerged as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress party for the 2015 general election. Buhari won the election, defeating incumbent President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. This was the first time in the history of Nigeria that an incumbent president lost a re-election bid. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015. In February 2019, Buhari was re-elected, defeating his closest rival, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, by over 3 million votes.

==Early life and education==
Muhammadu Buhari was born to a Fulani family on 17 December 1942, in Daura, a town in Katsina State, Nigeria. His father was Hardo Adamu, a Fulani chieftain from Dumurkul in Mai&#x27;Adua, while his mother, Zulaihat, had Hausa and Kanuri ancestry. He is the twenty-third child of his father and was named after ninth-century Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Bukhari.

Buhari&#x27;s great-grandfather, Yusuf, was a founder of several settlements in Daura, including Dumurkul. Many of his relatives held positions in the Native Administration of the Daura Emirate under the British colonial government. His maternal grandfather, Won Rabbe, was a Kanuri immigrant from Bornu who fled to Daura in the 19th-century to escape a political upheaval. During this period, the Fulani, under the Sokoto Caliphate, had forced the Hausa ruler of Daura into exile in what is now Niger Republic. There, the Hausa ruler gave Won Rabbe&#x27;s son a daughter of a Hausa dignitary to marry.

When Buhari&#x27;s father died, Waziri Alhassan, the son of Emir Musa of Daura (r. 1904–1911), who was the first Hausa ruler of Daura since 1805, became the guardian of Zulaihat and her six children, including the youngest, Buhari. Buhari was about four years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death. From an early age, he attended Qur&#x27;anic school and helped with cattle rearing. Initially a reluctant student, he preferred the outdoors and often skipped school. However, his guardian Waziri al-Hasan and his nephew, Mamman Daura, who was three years his senior, encouraged him to take his studies seriously.

Buhari later attended primary school in Daura and Mai&#x27;Adua, completing his studies in 1953. He then continued to Katsina Middle School and later Katsina Provincial Secondary School, where he studied from 1956 to 1961, earning his West African School Certificate. During his sixth form, he served as house captain and head boy of the school. In 1960, he was awarded a scholarship by the Elder Dempster shipping line for a summer visit to Britain.

After completing his secondary education, Buhari initially considered studying to become a medical doctor. However, the only available option at the time was to pursue Pharmacology at the Nigerian College of Arts, Science, and Technology (NCAS) in Zaria, a path that would require many years of advanced study. Instead, Buhari was encouraged by Mamman Daura to join the military and pursue higher education through it. He took this advice as he was already considering a military career inspired by the example of Hassan Katsina, then a junior officer. During this period, Hassan Katsina would often take secondary school boys in the Katsina Province on night hikes, where they camped under the stars. Buhari enjoyed these hikes and the sense of adventure they provided.

==Military career==
In 1962, at the age of 19, Buhari was one of 70 boys selected nationwide for officer training at the Nigerian Military Training College (NMTC). In February 1964, the college was upgraded to an officer commissioning unit of the Nigerian Army and renamed the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) (prior to 1964, the Nigerian government sent cadets who had completed their NMTC preliminary training to mostly Commonwealth military academies for officer cadet training).

From 1962 to 1963, Buhari underwent officer cadet training at Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot in England. In January 1963, at age 20, Buhari was commissioned a second lieutenant and appointed Platoon Commander of the Second Infantry Battalion in Abeokuta, Nigeria. From November 1963 to January 1964, Buhari attended the Platoon Commanders&#x27; Course at the Nigerian Military Training College, Kaduna. In 1964, he facilitated his military training by attending the Mechanical Transport Officer&#x27;s Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden, United Kingdom.

From 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and was appointed brigade major, Second Sector, First Infantry Division, April 1967 to July 1967. Following the bloody 1966 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état, which resulted in the death of Premier Ahmadu Bello, Lieutenant Buhari, alongside several young officers from Northern Nigeria, took part in the July counter-coup which ousted General Aguiyi Ironsi, replacing him with General Yakubu Gowon.

===Civil war===

Buhari was assigned to the 1st Division under the command of Lt. Col Mohammed Shuwa. The division had temporarily moved from Kaduna to Makurdi at the onset of the Nigerian Civil War. The 1st division was divided into sectors and then battalions, with Shuwa assisted by sector commanders Martin Adamu and Sule Apollo, who was later replaced by Theophilus Danjuma. Buhari&#x27;s initial assignment was as Adjutant and Company Commander 2 battalion unit, Second Sector Infantry of the 1st Division. The 2 battalion was one of the units that participated in the first actions of the war: they started from Gakem near Afikpo and moved towards Ogoja, with support from Gado Nasko&#x27;s artillery squad. They reached and captured Ogoja within a week, with the intention of advancing through the flanks to Enugu, the rebel capital. Buhari was briefly the 2 battalion&#x27;s Commander and led the battalion to Afikpo to link with the 3rd Marine Commando and advance towards Enugu through Nkalagu and Abakaliki. However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to Nsukka as Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin, who would later become battle fatigued and replaced by Isa Bukar. Buhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in Abeokuta and Zaria. In 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector, also called the Awka sector, which was charged with taking over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2. The sector&#x27;s operations were within the Awka-Abagana-Onitsha region, which was important to Biafran forces because it was a major source of food supply. It was in the sector that Buhari&#x27;s group suffered a lot of casualties trying to protect the food supplies route of the rebels along Oji River and Abagana.

=== After the war ===
From 1970 to 1971, Buhari was Brigade Major/Commandant, Thirty-first Infantry Brigade. He then served as the Assistant Adjutant-General, First Infantry Division Headquarters, from 1971 to 1972. He also attended the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, India, in 1973. From 1974 to 1975 Buhari was acting director of Transport and Supply at the Nigerian Army Corps of Supply and Transport Headquarters.

In the 1975 military coup d&#x27;état, Lieutenant Colonel Buhari was among a group of officers that brought General Murtala Mohammed to power. He was later appointed Governor of the North-Eastern State from 1 August 1975 to 3 February 1976, to oversee social, economic and political improvements in the state. On 3 February 1976, the North Eastern State was divided into three states Bauchi, Borno and Gongola. Buhari then became the first Governor of Borno State from 3 February 1976 to 15 March 1976.

In March 1976, following the botched 1976 military coup d&#x27;état attempt which led to the assassination of General Murtala Mohammed, his deputy General Olusegun Obasanjo became the military head of state and appointed Colonel Buhari as the Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources (now minister). In 1977, when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was created, Buhari was appointed as its chairman, a position he held until 1978.

During his tenure as the Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources, the government invested in pipelines and petroleum storage infrastructures. The government built about 21 petroleum storage depots all over the country from Lagos to Maiduguri and from Calabar to Gusau; the administration constructed a pipeline network that connected Bonny terminal and the Port Harcourt refinery to the depots. Also, the administration signed the contract for the construction of a refinery in Kaduna and an oil pipeline that will connect the Escravos oil terminal to Warri Refinery and the proposed Kaduna refinery.

From 1978 to 1979, he was Military Secretary at the Army Headquarters and was a member of the Supreme Military Council from 1978 to 1979. From 1979 to 1980, at the rank of colonel, Buhari (class of 1980) attended the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in the United States, and gained a master&#x27;s degree in Strategic Studies. Upon completion of the on-campus full-time resident program lasting ten months and the two-year-long, distance learning program, the United States Army War College (USAWC) awards its graduate officers a master&#x27;s degree in Strategic Studies.

Divisional commands held in the Nigerian Army:

* General Officer Commanding, 4th Infantry Division: August 1980 – January 1981
* General Officer Commanding, 2nd Mechanised Infantry Division: January 1981 – October 1981
* General Officer Commanding, 3rd Armed Division: October 1981 – December 1983

=== Coup d&#x27;état of 1983 ===

Major-General Buhari was one of the leaders of the military coup of December 1983 that overthrew the Second Nigerian Republic. At the time of the coup plot, Buhari was the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Third Armoured Division of Jos. With the successful execution of the coup by General Buhari, Tunde Idiagbon was appointed Chief of General Staff (the de facto No. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria&#x27;s short-lived Second Republic, a period of multi-party democracy revived in 1979, after 13 years of military rule.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the officers who took power argued that &quot;a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all&quot;. Buhari justified the military&#x27;s seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the constitution. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. In the military&#x27;s first broadcast after the coup, Sani Abacha linked &#x27;an inept and corrupt leadership&#x27; with general economic decline. In Buhari&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the Second Republic but also as the cause of a general decline in morality in society.

==Head of State (1983–1985)==

=== Consolidation of power ===
The structure of the new military leadership—the fifth in Nigeria since independence—resembled the last military regime, the Obasanjo/Yaradua administration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States. The number of ministries was trimmed to 18, while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, and the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree, which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity. Other decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree, which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.

According to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months. Strikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria&#x27;s security agency, the National Security Organization (NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers. The NSO played a wide role in the cracking down of public dissent by intimidating, harassing and jailing individuals who broke the interdiction on strikes. By October 1984, about 200,000 civil servants were retrenched. Buhari mounted an offensive against entrenched interests. In 20 months as Head of State, about 500 politicians, officials and businessmen were jailed for corruption during his stewardship. Detainees were released after releasing sums to the government and agreeing to meet certain conditions. The regime also jailed its critics, including Fela Kuti. He was arrested on 4 September 1984 at the airport as he was about to embark on an American tour. Amnesty International described the charges brought against him for illegally exporting foreign currency as &quot;spurious&quot;. Using the wide powers bestowed upon it by Decree Number 2, the government sentenced Fela to five years in prison. He was released after 18 months, when the Buhari regime was overthrown.

In 1984, Buhari passed Decree Number 4, the Protection Against False Accusations Decree, a wide-ranging repressive press law. Section 1 of the law provided that &quot;Any person who publishes in any form, whether written or otherwise, any message, rumour, report or statement [...] which is false in any material particular or which brings or is calculated to bring the Federal Military Government or the Government of a state or public officer to ridicule or disrepute, shall be guilty of an offense under this Decree&quot;. The law further stated that offending journalists and publishers will be tried by an open military tribunal, whose ruling would be final and unappealable in any court and those found guilty would be eligible for a fine not less than 10,000 naira and a jail sentence of up to two years.

===Economics===
In order to reform the economy, as Head of State, Buhari started to rebuild the nation&#x27;s social-political and economic systems, along the realities of Nigeria&#x27;s austere economic conditions. The rebuilding included removing or cutting back the excesses in national expenditure, obliterating or removing completely, corruption from the nation&#x27;s social ethics, shifting from mainly public sector employment to self-employment. Buhari also encouraged import substitution industrialisation based to a great extent on the use of local materials. However, tightening of imports led to reduction in raw materials for industries causing many industries to operate below capacity, reduction of workers and in some cases business closure.

Buhari broke ties with the International Monetary Fund, when the fund asked the government to devalue the naira by 60%. However, the reforms that Buhari instigated on his own were as or more rigorous as those required by the IMF.

On 7 May 1984, Buhari announced the country&#x27;s 1984 National Budget. The budget came with a series of complementary measures:

*A temporary ban on recruiting federal public sector workers
*Raising of interest rates
*Halting capital projects
*Prohibition of borrowing by state governments
*15 percent cut from Shagari&#x27;s 1983 Budget
*Realignment of import duties
*Reducing the balance of payment deficit by cutting imports
*It also gave priority to the importation of raw materials and spare parts that were needed for agriculture and industry.

Other economic measures by Buhari took the form of counter trade, currency change, price reduction of goods and services. His economic policies did not earn him the legitimacy of the masses due to the rise in inflation and the use of military might to continue to push many policies blamed for the rise in food prices.

===Mass social mobilization===

One of the most enduring legacies of the Buhari government has been the War Against Indiscipline (WAI). Launched on 20 March 1984, the policy tried to address the perceived lack of public morality and civic responsibility of Nigerian society. Unruly Nigerians were ordered to form neat queues at bus stops, under the eyes of whip-wielding soldiers. Civil servants who failed to show up on time at work were humiliated and forced to do &quot;frog jumps&quot;. Minor offences carried long sentences. Any student over the age of 17 caught cheating on an exam would get 21 years in prison. Counterfeiting and arson could lead to the death penalty.

Buhari&#x27;s administration enacted three decrees to investigate corruption and control foreign exchange. The Banking (Freezing of Accounts) Decree of 1984, allotted to the Federal Military Government the power to freeze bank accounts of persons suspected to have committed fraud. The Recovery of Public Property (Special Military Tribunals) Decree permitted the government to investigate the assets of public officials linked with corruption and constitute a military tribunal to try such persons. The Exchange Control (Anti-Sabotage) Decree stated penalties for violators of foreign exchange laws.

Decree 20 on illegal ship bunkering and drug trafficking was another example of Buhari&#x27;s tough approach to crime. Section 3 (2) (K) provided that &quot;any person who, without lawful authority deals in, sells, smokes or inhales the drug known as cocaine or other similar drugs, shall be guilty under section 6 (3) (K) of an offence and liable on conviction to suffer death sentence by firing squad.&quot; In the case of Bernard Ogedengebe, the Decree was applied retroactively. He was executed even if at the time of his arrest the crime did not mandate the capital punishment, but had carried a sentence of six months imprisonment. In another prominent case of April 1985, six Nigerians were condemned to death under the same decree: Sidikatu Tairi, Sola Oguntayo, Oladele Omosebi, Lasunkanmi Awolola, Jimi Adebayo and Gladys Iyamah.

In 1985, prompted by economic uncertainties and a rising crime rate, the government of Buhari opened the borders (closed since April 1984) with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon to speed up the expulsion of 700,000 illegal foreigners and illegal migrant workers. Buhari is today known for this crisis; there even is a famine in the east of Niger that have been named &quot;El Buhari&quot;. His regime drew criticism from many, including Nigeria&#x27;s first Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka, who, in 2007, wrote a piece called &quot;The Crimes of Buhari&quot; which outlined many of the abuses conducted under his military rule.

Ahead of the 2015 general election, Buhari responded to his human rights criticism by saying that if elected, he would follow the rule of law, and that there would be access to justice for all Nigerians and respect for fundamental human rights of Nigerians.

=== Coup d&#x27;état of 1985 ===
In August 1985, Major General Buhari was overthrown in a coup led by General Ibrahim Babangida and other members of the ruling Supreme Military Council (SMC). Babangida brought many of Buhari&#x27;s most vocal critics into his administration, including Fela Kuti&#x27;s brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, a doctor who had led a strike against Buhari to protest declining health care services. Buhari was then detained in Benin City until 1988.

==Pre-presidency (1985–2015)==

=== Detention ===
Buhari spent three years of detention in a small guarded bungalow in Benin. He had access to television that showed two channels and members of his family were allowed to visit him on the authorization of Babangida.

=== Civilian life ===
In December 1988, after his mother&#x27;s death he was released and retired to his residence in Daura. While in detention, his farm was managed by his relatives. He divorced his first wife in 1988 and married Aisha Halilu. In Katsina, he became the pioneer chairman of Katsina Foundation that was founded to encourage social and economic development in Katsina State.

Buhari served as the Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), a body created by the government of General Sani Abacha, and funded from the revenue generated by the increase in price of petroleum products, to pursue developmental projects around the country. A 1998 report in &quot;New African&quot; praised the PTF under Buhari for its transparency, calling it a rare &quot;success story&quot;.

=== Presidential campaigns and elections===

2003 presidential election

In 2003, Buhari ran for the office of the president as the candidate of the All Nigeria People&#x27;s Party (ANPP). He was defeated by the People&#x27;s Democratic Party incumbent, President Olusẹgun Ọbasanjọ, by more than 11 million votes.

====2007 presidential election====

On 18 December 2006, Buhari was nominated as the consensus candidate of the All Nigeria People&#x27;s Party. His main challenger in the April 2007 polls was the ruling PDP candidate, Umaru Yar&#x27;Adua, who hailed from the same home state of Katsina. Buhari officially took 18% of the vote to Yar&#x27;Adua&#x27;s 70%, but Buhari rejected these results. After Yar&#x27;Adua took office, he called for a government of national unity to bring on board aggrieved opposition members. The ANPP joined the government with appointment of its national chairman as a member of Yar&#x27;Adua&#x27;s cabinet, but Buhari denounced this agreement.

==== 2011 presidential election ====

In March 2010, Buhari left the ANPP for the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), a party he had helped to found. He said that he had supported foundation of the CPC &quot;as a solution to the debilitating, ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party the ANPP&quot;.

Buhari was the CPC presidential candidate in the 2011 election, running against incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu of Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), and Ibrahim Shekarau of ANPP. They were the major contenders among 20 candidates. Buhari campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and pledged to remove immunity protections from government officials. He also gave support to enforcement of Sharia law in Nigeria&#x27;s northern states, which had previously caused him political difficulties among Christian voters in the country&#x27;s south.

The elections were marred by widespread sectarian violence, which claimed the lives of 800 people across the country, as Buhari&#x27;s supporters attacked Christian settlements in the country&#x27;s central region. The three-day uprising was blamed in part on Buhari&#x27;s inflammatory comments. In spite of assurances from Human Rights Watch, which had judged the elections &quot;among the fairest in Nigeria&#x27;s history&quot;, Buhari claimed that the vote was flawed and warned that &quot;If what happened in 2011 should again happen in 2015, by the grace of God, the dog and the baboon would all be soaked in blood&quot;.

Buhari remained a &quot;folk hero&quot; to some for his vocal opposition to corruption. He won 12,214,853 votes, coming in second to Jonathan, who polled 22,495,187 votes and was declared the winner.

==== 2015 presidential election ====
Buhari ran in the 2015 presidential election as a candidate of the All Progressives Congress party. His platform was built around his image as a staunch anti-corruption fighter and his incorruptible and honest reputation, but he said he would not probe past corrupt leaders and would give officials who stole in the past amnesty if they repented.

In the runup to the 2015 election, Jonathan&#x27;s campaign asked that Buhari be disqualified from the election, claiming that he was in breach of the Constitution. According to the fundamental document, in order to qualify for election to the office of the president, a person must be &quot;educated up to at least School certificate level or its equivalent&quot;. Buhari failed to submit any such evidence, claiming that he lost the original copies of his diplomas when his house was raided following his overthrow from power in 1985.

In May 2014, in the wake of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping, Buhari strongly denounced the Boko Haram insurgency. He &quot;urged Nigerians to put aside religion, politics and all other divisions to crush the insurgency he said is fanned by mindless bigots masquerading as Muslims&quot;. In July 2014, Buhari escaped a bomb attack on his life by Boko Haram in Kaduna, 82 people were killed. In December 2014, Buhari pledged to enhance security in Nigeria if elected president. After this announcement, Buhari&#x27;s approval ratings skyrocketed, largely due to Jonathan&#x27;s apparent inability to fight Boko Haram. Buhari made internal security and wiping out the militant group one of the key pillars of his campaign. In January 2015, the insurgent group &quot;The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta&quot; (MEND) endorsed Buhari.

In February 2015, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo quit the ruling PDP party and endorsed Buhari.

On 31 March, Jonathan called Buhari to concede and congratulate him on his election as president. Buhari was sworn in on 29 May 2015 in a ceremony attended by at least 23 heads of state and government.

===Second inauguration===
The second inauguration of Buhari as the 15th president of Nigeria, and 4th president in the fourth Nigerian Republic took place on Wednesday, 29 May 2019, following the 2019 Nigerian presidential election and marking the start of the second and final four-year term of Muhammadu Buhari as president and Yemi Osinbajo as vice president. It was the 8th presidential inauguration in Nigeria, and 6th in the fourth republic.

The official swearing-in ceremony took place at Eagle Square in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. Acting Chief Justice Tanko Muhammad administered the oath of office taken by President Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The traditional inaugural speech was not delivered. Former Nigerian heads of state General Yakubu Gowon, General Ibrahim Babangida, Interim President Ernest Shonekan, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, General Olusegun Obasanjo and President Goodluck Jonathan were in attendance.

== Presidency (2015–2023) ==
The economy has averaged a growth rate of 0.9% since the administration&#x27;s first term, unemployment is at an all-time high of 23%, and millions entered poverty. Since 2015, Buhari has lost supporters due to his perceived un-energetic personality and contemplative decision making.

=== Cabinet ===
Buhari&#x27;s key advisers include: his nephew Mamman Daura, businessman Ismaila Isa Funtua, political operator Baba Gana Kingibe, Abba Kyari the Chief of Staff to the President; and from the late stages of his first term, Boss Mustapha the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Empowering his kitchen cabinet after his second inauguration, Buhari has stated his preference for cabinet members seeking meetings or consultation to direct such requests through the chief of staff or through the government secretary.

Since the Fourth Republic, ministerial positions are legally required to be composed of a federal ethno-demographic character with a minister representing each state of the federation. A result of this has created the outcome of political considerations as an important factor in nominating ministers as local party officials lacking in merit jostle for cabinet positions. Nomination into Buhari&#x27;s cabinet has been influenced by those political considerations and also closeness to the president and his inner cabinet.

In August 2019, the president named his cabinet of predominantly male members with an average years of 60 and dominated by political actors or those close to the president. The cabinet include two wealthy former governors from the Niger Delta, Timipre Sylva and Godswill Akpabio who were originally members of the opposition party PDP and fourteen retained ministers some of whom critics alleged had performed poorly or having a close relationship with a corrupt past Head of State.

=== Health ===
In May 2016, Buhari cancelled a two-day visit to Lagos to inaugurate projects in the state but he was represented by the Vice-president Yemi Osinbajo after citing an &quot;ear infection&quot; suspected to be Ménière&#x27;s disease. On 6 June, Buhari travelled to the United Kingdom to seek medical attention. This happened days after the Presidential Spokesman Femi Adesina was quoted as saying Buhari was &quot;as fit as fiddle&quot; and &quot;hale and hearty&quot;, to much discontent and criticism from political analysts and followers. In February 2017, following what were described as &quot;routine medical check-ups&quot; in the UK, Buhari asked parliament to extend his medical leave to await test results. His office did not give any further details on his health condition nor the expected date of his return. On 8 February, President Buhari personally signed a letter addressed to the President of the Senate of Nigeria alerting him of a further extension to his annual leave, leaving his vice president in charge. Following an absence of 51 days from office, President Buhari returned to Nigeria. He arrived at Kaduna Airport in the morning of 10 March. Although information was limited during his stay in London, he was pictured on 9 March meeting the most senior cleric of the world Anglican congregation, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Vice President Yemi Osibanjo remained in charge as acting president, while the President continued to recover in Abuja. The President has missed major official and public appearances just two months following his return to office from England. Most recently he was absent from the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, the worker&#x27;s day event held at the Eagle Square in Abuja on May Day 2017. Speculations about the President&#x27;s health circulated in the public sphere in the days following President Buhari&#x27;s wishes to &quot;work from home&quot;. Some prominent Nigerian figures urged the President to take a long-term medical leave, citing his failure to make any public appearances over a two-week period.

President Buhari again left Nigeria for a reported health check-up in London on 7 May 2017. President Buhari returned to Nigeria from his medical leave in the United Kingdom 104 days after leaving, on 19 August 2017. On 8 May, Buhari left Nigeria to London for medical check up, upon arrival from USA; and he returned on Friday 11 May 2018.

=== Economy ===
Buhari was an attractive choice to many Nigerians because of a perceived incorruptible character. Once in power, Buhari who had earlier mobilized supporters in three previous elections was slow to manifest his intention to solve problems he mentioned during his campaign. Determination to initiate his domestic policy agenda like naming of cabinet officials took six months, while the passage of the 2016 and 2017 budgets were delayed by infighting.

In Buhari&#x27;s first year in office, Nigeria suffered a decline in commodity prices which triggered an economic recession. To source funds to close shortfall in revenue and fund an expansionary capital budget, Buhari traveled to 20 countries seeking loans. Thereby, expansionary budget allocation to finance infrastructure was pushed back to a further date.

In the first year of the administration, Naira, the currency of Nigeria depreciated in the black market leading to a gulf between the official exchange rate and the black-market rate. A resulting shortage in foreign exchange hit various businesses including petroleum marketers. However, the gulf between the official rates and the black market rates opened up the opportunity for well connected individuals to engage in arbitrage, making a mockery of the president&#x27;s anti-corruption image. In May 2016, the government announced a rise in the official pump price of petroleum to curtail shortfall in the commodity as a result of foreign exchange shortages.

In 2016, the country&#x27;s economy declined by 1.6% and in 2017 per capita economic growth is projected to be negligible. Buhari&#x27;s first tenure as head of state coincided with a decline in oil prices similar to his second stint but his administration has not shown dedicated effort to diversify sources of government spending. The 2018 budget signaled an expansionary fiscal policy with funds dedicated to infrastructural projects such as strategic roads, bridges and power plants.

Since an upturn in economic growth from the decline of 2016, a slow pace of recovery has the country behind many of its continental neighbors in GDP growth. Unemployment levels remain high and any effort to increase non-oil revenues has not improved while government deficit spending include a significant portion of its yearly budget dedicated to service debts.

Buhari with the support of the Central Bank chief initiated policies to improve agriculture production through lobbying private banks to lend to the sector and restriction of foreign exchange at official rates for importation of food product that are grown locally. In his second term, the budget minister, Udo Udoma and trade minister, Enemalah both of whom favored liberalisation were not returned.

The government continued to operate flexible exchange rates into the second term of the administration despite critics alluding to the exchange rate regime of being susceptible to arbitrage abuses and round tripping by cronies of the government.

=== Social welfare ===
In 2016, Buhari launched the National Social Investment Program, a national social welfare program. The Program was created to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources to vulnerable populations, including children, youth, and women. There are four programs which address poverty, unemployment and help increase economic development:

* The N-Power program provides young Nigerians with job training and education, as well as a monthly stipend of 30,000 Nigerian naira (US$83.33).
* Npower is a social investment scheme initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari on 8 June 2016 in an attempt to boost the youths employment rate. The scheme was established as a core component of the National Social Investment program to cushion the skill acquisition training and capacity building in the beneficiaries.
* The Conditional Cash Transfer Program (CCTP) directly supports the most vulnerable by providing cash to those in the lowest income group, helping reduce poverty, improve nutrition and self-sustainability, and supporting development through increased consumption.
* The Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program (GEEP) is a micro-lending entrepreneurship program targeting farmers, petty traders and market women with a focus. This program provides no-cost loans to its beneficiaries, helping reduce the start-up costs of business ventures in Nigeria. The programs include: TraderMoni, MarketMoni and FarmerMoni.
* The National Home Grown School Feeding Program (NHGSF) is attempting to increase school enrollment by providing free meals to schoolchildren, particularly those in poor and food-insecure regions. The program works with local farmers and empowers women as cooks, building the community and sustaining economic growth from farm to table.

The program was previously co-ordinated from the office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, until 2019, when the program was moved to the new Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development under Sadiya Umar Farouq. In his 2019 Independence Day Speech, the President attributed the movement to the need to have the programmes institutionalized.

=== Anti-corruption ===

The $2 billion arms deal was exposed following the interim report of Buhari&#x27;s investigations committee on arms procurement under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. The committee report showed extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under Goodluck Jonathan&#x27;s watch. Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria. The investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in the procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for the purpose for which the money was disbursed. Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of Sambo Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser who later mentioned prominent Nigerians involved in the deal. Those who were mentioned and arrested includes Raymond Dokpesi, the Chair Emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance, Azubuike Ihejirika, the Chief of Army Staff, Adesola Nunayon Amosu, the former Chief of the Air Staff, Alex Badeh and several other politicians were mentioned.

On 21 December 2016, the government&#x27;s Federal Ministry of Finance announced a whistle-blowing policy with a 2.5%-5% reward. The aim is to obtain relevant data or information regarding: the violation of financial regulations, the mismanagement of public funds and assets, financial malpractice, fraud, and theft.

In May 2018, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria&#x27;s anti-corruption agency, announced that 603 Nigerian figures had been convicted on corruption charges since Buhari took office in 2015. The EFCC also announced that for the first time in Nigeria&#x27;s history, judges and top military officers including retired service chiefs are being prosecuted for corruption. The successful prosecutions were also credited to Buhari&#x27;s EFCC head Ibrahim Magu. Under Buhari, Chief Justice of the Nigerian Court Walter Onnoghen was convicted by the Code of Conduct Tribunal on 18 April 2019, for false assets declaration. In December 2019, Mohammed Bello Adoke, the former Attorney General of the Federation, was extradited to Nigeria to stand trial on corruption charges. In January 2020, however, Transparency International still gave Nigeria a low performance in its corruption perception index.

In July 2020, Ibrahim Magu the EFCC chairman was arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) over damaging security reports concerning his activities as the Buhari administration&#x27;s leading anti-corruption figure and alleged financial irregularities, he was later replaced by Mohammed Umar. In December 2020, Former Pension Reform Taskforce head Abdulrasheed Maina, who was arrested in the neighboring country of Niger after jumping bail, appeared in an Abuja court on a 12-count charge of fraud and money laundering. Ali Ndume, a senator representing Borno South, was arrested after jumping bail as well.

=== Security issues ===
==== Niger Delta ====

Nigeria has the second-largest reserves of crude oil in Africa, reserves largely found in the Niger Delta region of the country. Years of oil production have resulted negative impact on farming and fishery by oil spillage. The government initiated Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP) to help clean up Ogoniland while other state governors within the region want a similar setup. HYPREP was initiated in 2005 but has been slow to commence remediation works in Ogoniland.

Nonetheless, there are still intermittent attacks on oil facilities by groups such as the Niger Delta Avengers. This has significantly affected oil production leading to cuts in exports and government revenue. The Avengers are waging conflict for greater economic and political autonomy.

==== Shia Muslims ====

The Islamic Movement of Nigeria led by Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky is one of the country&#x27;s leading organization of Shia Muslims. Nigeria&#x27;s Muslim population is mainly Sunni while the Shia population have gone through sporadic persecution by governments. After the Islamic movement was accused of an attack against Chief of Army Staff Tukur Buratai in December 2015, Zakzaky&#x27;s base was shelled causing hundreds of fatalities while Zakzaky was arrested. Zakzaky was held for almost six years, aside from a three-day medical trip to India, until being acquitted and released in July 2021.

====Biafra separatists ====

A separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra and led by Nnamdi Kanu became high profile in 2015 for advocating independence for a separate nation of Biafra. A breakaway Biafra republic was briefly formed during Nigeria&#x27;s Civil War. In October 2015, Kanu was arrested on allegation of treason, his arrest was followed by protests against his detention across many Southeastern states. Kanu later jumped bail and fled abroad to help lead the low-level insurgency in Southeastern Nigeria before being arrested by Interpol and brought back to Nigeria.

==== Boko Haram ====

Since 2015, the fight against the extremists has taken a new dimension, internally the groups have splintered into the traditional Boko Haram sect controlled by Abubakar Shekau and the Islamic State in West Africa Province controlled by Abu Musab al-Barnawi. Other groups supported by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb such as Ansaru, who were driven from Mali due to the French-led Operation Serval have surfaced and co-operated with Boko Haram despite being its rival. This was mostly out of necessity, as the two factions could not risk to weaken themselves by fighting each other. In February 2020, over two hundred and fifty Ansaru members were killed in a police raid in Birnin Gwari.

In October 2016, the government negotiated a deal with the terrorist group, Boko Haram which secured the release of 21 Chibok girls. By December 2016, the government had recovered much of the territories previously held by Boko Haram and after the capture of Sambisa Forest, Buhari announced that Boko Haram has been technically defeated. The insurgency displaced about 2 million people from their homes and the recapture of the towns now present humanitarian challenges in health, education and nutrition. On 6 May 2017, Buhari&#x27;s government secured a further release of 82 out of 276 girls kidnapped in 2014, in exchange of five Boko Haram leaders. On 7 May 2017, President Buhari met with the 82 released Chibok girls, before departing to London, UK, for a follow-up treatment for an undisclosed illness.

Shekau committed suicide after his grouping was encircled by ISWAP rivals in May 2021. In the months following, hundreds of &quot;repentant&quot; terrorists surrendered to the government, many of whom were allegedly loyal to Shekau.

==== Herder–farmer violence ====

The Middle Belt region of Nigeria has been vulnerable to clashes between farmers and cattle herders, two groups trying to secure arable land for grazing or farming and access to water. The intensity and politicization of the conflict along ethnic and religious divide increased during the administration of Buhari as instances of conflicts flared in parts of Southern Nigeria. About 300 civilians were killed in a village in Benue State, Middle-Belt of the country and about 40 civilians were killed in Enugu in Southeastern Nigeria. The violence has displaced upwards of 250,000 villagers who migrate to cities ill-prepared to handle the influx of migrants. The conflict between farmers many of whom are largely Christians and herders who are predominantly Muslims has stoked religious tension not helped when the president sent in military troops disarm ethnic Christian militias while critics allege of his lukewarm towards armed cattle herders.

The administration&#x27;s effort to solve the conflict led to the National Livestock Transformation Plan to modernise cattle grazing and stabilize the Middle Belt region. In 2017, RUGA, an acronym for Rural Grazing Area but also a word meaning settlement in Fulani was a proposed solution that came from deliberations of the transformation plan. RUGA was to set aside grazing areas for herders as they migrate south, however, many Southern states opposed any involuntary acquisition of land for RUGA and the plan was suspended

==== Banditry in Northern Nigeria ====

Since 2015, the Buhari Administration has suffered with an increased spate of banditry-related activities in Northern Nigeria. The Abuja-Kaduna highway has been termed the &quot;highway of kidnapping&quot;, due to the rampant atrocities committed by bandits. In February 2020, the Northern Elders Forum, a socio-political organisation, said the administration has failed Nigerians in terms of security.

By July 2021, about 45 people a day were kidnapped, largely by bandits for ransom. Other bandits focused on stealing cattle, camels, and other livestock while some groups attacked and seized control of entire villages and wider territories. The banditry lead to fears of collaboration between bandits and Northeastern terrorists with those fears being confirmed in August 2021 when the Nigeria Immigration Service reported that large groups of Zamfara-based bandits were traveling to Borno State for training from Boko Haram.

=== National issues ===
==== Ruga policy ====

The Buhari administration introduced the controversial Ruga policy (human settlement policy), aimed at resolving the conflict between nomadic Fulani herdsmen and sedentary farmers. The policy, which is currently suspended, would &quot;create reserved communities where herders will live, grow and tend their cattle, produce milk and undertake other activities associated with the cattle business without having to move around in search of grazing land for their cows.&quot;

==== Alleged militarization ====

Buhari has faced a lot of criticism in office. In 2019 his government came under widespread criticism over the unfair treatment of US-based Social Activist Sowore during his trial, despite the court granting him bail. This move was largely condemned, with Sowore himself stating that Buhari had violated his civic space. In December 2019, Nigeria&#x27;s Newspaper Giants: PUNCH stated that henceforth they would addressed Buhari&#x27;s administration as a &quot;regime&quot; and subsequently address him as &quot;General Buhari&quot; as his military-like administration was a far cry from democracy. They insisted that he was a &#x27;military dictator&#x27;, a move that was greeted with mixed receptions on social media.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====


Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, Buhari established a Presidential Task Force for the control of the virus in the country. On 23 March, Buhari&#x27;s chief of staff Abba Kyari tested positive for COVID-19 sparking fears that Buhari may have been infected, it was later revealed that Buhari tested negative. On 30 March, Buhari announced a two-week lockdown on major cities Abuja, Lagos and Ogun.

On 14 October, the presidential task force on COVID-19 warned about a potential second wave &quot;if the guidelines and protocols are not adhered to strictly&quot;.

==== End SARS protests ====

In October 2020, protests against alleged police brutality of a special police unit of the Nigerian Police Force the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) erupted in Lagos and other major cities. The End SARS movement with no centralised leadership beyond the small assembly that organized the initial protests, share similarities with the 2012 Occupy movement.

On 12 October, a day after demonstrators declared their demands Buhari announced the disbandment of SARS and promised &quot;extensive police reforms&quot;. Since independence in 1960, the Nigerian Police Force has been at the forefront of tackling organised crime in Nigeria with the recent spate of banditry, cultism, drug trafficking, fraud and kidnapping drastically affecting its personnel capacity, leaving a vacuum for SARS members to exploit and commit extrajudicial killings.

On 13 October Mohammed Adamu the Inspector General of Police announced the creation of a new unit the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) to take over the duties of SARS. This move did not satisfy most demonstrators, who expected a substantial overhaul of the police structure. On 14 October, the demonstrations continued with at least ten protestors being killed, and violent clashes occurring between pro-SARS and anti-SARS protesters with the elite Presidential Guard Brigade intervening in the federal capital.

On 12 June 2021, Buhari ordered a nationwide deployment of members of the Nigerian Police Force and that of the Nigerian Army, to prevent planned anti-government protests. The government said it was to forestall the breakdown of law and order that became the norm during the October 2020 EndSARS protests.

=== Foreign policy ===


Buhari described the military crackdown by the Myanmar Army and police on Rohingya Muslims as ethnic cleansing and warned of a disaster like the Rwandan genocide.

Nigeria and South Africa between them share about 50% of Africa&#x27;s economic output but both countries macroeconomic structure is hampered by high poverty rates, youth unemployment and decline in capital investment. About 600,000 Nigerians have emigrated to South Africa to seek out better economic opportunities and like in Nigeria, it is an economy struggling with its own high unemployment rates. Tensions between migrants and the local populace have occasionally flared up, in 2008, 2015 and in 2019. The last resulted in the violence between migrants including Nigerians and black South Africans. The leaders of both countries met in early October 2019, to discuss measures to improve the relationship between both countries which has been affected not only by anti-migrant violence in South Africa both issues about profit repatriation by South African firms operating in Nigeria.

Buhari is the first president to call for a global treaty to end violence against women and girls.

== Post-presidency (2023–present) ==
Buhari handed over power peacefully to his successor Bola Tinubu on 29 May 2023 at 10AM (WAT) at an inauguration ceremony in Eagle Square, Federal Capital Territory. He left the seat of power in Abuja immediately after the handover ceremony and in keeping with the tradition of past heads of state and presidents returned to his home state of Katsina where he was received by state and traditional dignitaries before evidently retiring to his farm and family seat in Daura.

== Controversies ==

=== US$2.8 billion NNPC scandal ===

During his tenure as Federal Commissioner of Petroleum and Natural Resources, US$2.8 billion allegedly went missing from the accounts of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in Midlands Bank in the United Kingdom. General Ibrahim Babangida later allegedly accused Buhari of being responsible for this fraud.

However, in the conclusion of the Crude Oil Sales Tribunal of Inquiry headed by Justice Ayo Irikefe to investigate allegations of 2.8 billion Dollars misappropriation from the NNPC account, the tribunal found no truth in the allegations even though it noticed some lapses in the NNPC accounts.

=== Chadian military affair ===

In 1983, when Chadian forces invaded Nigeria in the Borno State, Buhari used the forces under his command to chase them out of the country, crossing into Chadian territory in spite of an order given by President Shagari to withdraw. This 1983 Chadian military affair led to more than 100 victims and &quot;prisoners of war&quot;.

=== Umaru Dikko affair ===

The Umaru Dikko Affair was another defining moment in Buhari&#x27;s military government. Umaru Dikko, a former Minister of Transportation under the previous civilian administration of President Shagari who fled the country shortly after the coup, was accused of embezzling $1 billion in oil profits. With the help of an alleged former Mossad agent, the NSO traced him to London, where operatives from Nigeria and Israel drugged and kidnapped him. They placed him in a plastic bag, which was subsequently hidden inside a crate labelled as &quot;Diplomatic Baggage&quot;. The purpose of this secret operation was to ship Dikko off to Nigeria on an empty Nigerian Airways Boeing 707, to stand trial for embezzlement. The plot was foiled by British airport officers.

=== 53 suitcases saga ===
Buhari&#x27;s administration was embroiled in a scandal concerning the fate of 53 suitcases with unknown contents. The suitcases were being transported by the Emir of Gwandu, whose son was Buhari&#x27;s aide-de-camp, and were cleared through customs on 10 June 1984 without inspection during his return flight from Saudi Arabia.

=== PTF allocation to the military ===
While Buhari was Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), critics had questioned the PTF&#x27;s allocation of 20% of its resources to the military, which they feared would not be accountable for the revenue.

Akhaine, Saxone (27 August 2001) Nigeria: Buhari Calls for Sharia in All States . He was quoted in 2001 as saying, &quot;I will continue to show openly and inside me the total commitment to the Sharia movement that is sweeping all over Nigeria&quot;, he then added: &quot;God willing, we will not stop the agitation for the total implementation of the Sharia in the country.&quot; Buhari has denied all allegations that he has a radical Islamist agenda. On 6 January 2015, Buhari said: &quot;Because they can&#x27;t attack our record, they accuse me falsely of ethnic jingoism; they accuse me falsely of religious fundamentalism. Because they cannot attack our record, they accuse us falsely of calling for election violence – when we have only insisted on peace. Even as Head of State, we never imposed Sha&#x27;riah.&quot;

=== Mediation with Boko Haram ===
In 2012, Buhari&#x27;s name was included on a list published by Boko Haram of individuals it would trust to mediate between the group and the Federal Government. However, Buhari strongly objected and declined to mediate between the government and Boko Haram. In 2013, Muhammadu Buhari made a series of statements, when he asked the Federal Government to stop the killing of Boko Haram members and blamed the rise of the terrorist group on the prevalence of Niger Delta militants in the South. Buhari stated that &quot;what is responsible for the security situation in the country is caused by the activities of Niger Delta militants [...] The Niger Delta militants started it all&quot;. He also questioned the special treatment including close to $500 million a year paid to 30,000 militants under the amnesty programme since 2013 by the Federal Government and deplored the fact that Boko Haram members were killed and their houses destroyed.

=== Abolishing the office of the first lady ===

In December 2014, Muhammadu Buhari went on the record to say he would abolish the office of the First Lady if he was elected as president, claiming it was unconstitutional.

The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a Nigerian militant group that endorsed Buhari during the 2015 general elections, commended Buhari for his plans and went on to say that the office of the First Lady was &quot;obviously an irrelevant, fraudulent and unconstitutional office, whose only purpose is to further plunder the resources of the country.&quot;

Since assuming the presidency on 29 May 2015, Buhari has yet to terminate the office of the First Lady. Aisha Buhari operates from the office of the First Lady as &quot;wife of the President&quot;.

Having suggested the abolition of the office of the First Lady, Buhari has further aired some controversial statements about women.

During a visit to Germany, and standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Buhari reiterated &quot;I don&#x27;t know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room&quot; after his wife had earlier advised him to step up his leadership.

=== Plagiarism scandal ===
In September 2016, President Buhari came under heavy criticism after a newspaper report found him using plagiarized speech during the launching of a national re-orientation campaign tagged &quot;Change begins with me&quot;. The speech was later found to be lifted from the 2009 inaugural speech of former US President Barack Obama. The presidency later apologized and says the blunder was caused by &quot;overzealous staff&quot; and &quot;Those responsible&quot; will be sanctioned. However, one week later, a deputy director in the State House linked to the speech was redeployed and presidency assured Nigerian public that it has taken steps to avoid a repeat of such an embarrassing occurrence by implementing digital tools that detect plagiarism.

=== Twitter Ban ===

After Buhari made a Twitter post threatening violence against the Biafra insurgents in southeast Nigeria on 5 June 2021, Twitter deleted his comments as violations of its terms of service. Shortly thereafter, the Nigerian government banned Twitter from the country entirely. They lifted the ban on 13 January 2022, after they said Twitter had agreed to register its operations in Nigeria and pay tax.

=== Signature Forgery Scandal ===
As part of the discovery made in a lawsuit levelled against the former CBN Governor of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, Boss Mustapha, a senior official in ex-President Buhari&#x27;s administration, testified that three suspects allegedly stole $6.2m (£4.9m) from the central bank, using the forged signature of then President Muhammadu Buhari.

==Personal life==

=== Family ===

In 1971, Buhari married his first wife, Safinatu (née Yusuf). They had five children together, four girls and one boy. Their first daughter, Zulaihat (Zulai) was named after Buhari&#x27;s mother. Their other children are Fatima, Musa (deceased son), Hadiza, and Safinatu. In 1988, Buhari and his first wife Safinatu divorced. On 14 January 2006, Safinatu died from complications of diabetes. In November 2012, Buhari&#x27;s first daughter, Zulaihat (née Buhari) Junaid died from sickle cell anaemia, two days after having a baby at a hospital in Kaduna.

In December 1989, Buhari married his second and current wife Aisha Buhari (née Halilu). They also had five children together, a boy and four girls: Aisha, Halima, Yusuf, Zahra &quot;Zarah&quot; and Amina. Yusuf married Zahra Nasir Bayero, the daughter of Emir Nasiru Ado Bayero, in August 2021.

Buhari is a Muslim.

=== Wealth ===
In 2015, Buhari declared US$150,000 cash; in addition to five homes and two mud houses as well as farms, an orchard and a ranch of 270 head of cattle, 25 sheep, five horses and a variety of birds, shares in three firms, two undeveloped plots of land, and two cars bought from his savings.

In 2017, the South-East council of traditional rulers honoured President Buhari with the chieftaincy titles of the Enyioma I of Ebonyi and the Ochioha I of Igboland. At the time of his investiture, the president had already held a title—that of the Ogbuagu I of Igboland—in the Nigerian chieftaincy system. He was later awarded another one, Ikeogu I of Igboland, in the following year.

<text>A diploma mill or degree mill is a business that sells illegitimate diplomas or academic degrees, respectively. The term &quot;diploma mill&quot; is also used pejoratively to describe any educational institution with low standards for admission and graduation, low career placement rate, or low average starting salaries of its graduates.

The degrees can be fabricated, falsified, or misrepresented. These businesses may claim to give credit for relevant life experience but without actual prior learning assessment programs. They may also claim to evaluate work history or require submission of a thesis or dissertation for evaluation to give an appearance of authenticity. Diploma mills are frequently supported by accreditation mills set up for the purpose of providing an appearance of authenticity. Diploma mills are considered a global threat to academic integrity.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;diploma mill&quot; originally denotes an institution providing diplomas on an intensive and profit-making basis, like a factory. More broadly, it describes any institution that offers qualifications which are not accredited nor based on proper academic assessment. While the terms &quot;degree mill&quot; and &quot;diploma mill&quot; are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn. A &quot;degree mill&quot; issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate, while a &quot;diploma mill&quot; issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities.

Academic diplomas may be legitimately awarded without any study as a recognition of authority or experience. When given extraordinarily, such degrees are called honorary degrees or &quot;honoris causa&quot; degrees. Also, in some universities, holders of a lower degree (such as a bachelor&#x27;s degree) may be routinely awarded honorary higher degrees (such as a master&#x27;s degree) without study.

The term &quot;diploma mill&quot; may also be used pejoratively to describe a legitimate institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate, such as for-profit schools.

==Characteristics==
Diploma mills share a number of features that differentiate them from respected institutions, although some legitimate institutions may exhibit some of the same characteristics.

===Accreditation and authenticity===

The most notable feature of diploma mills is that they lack accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. (Note, however, that not all unaccredited institutions of higher learning are diploma mills.) Diploma mills therefore employ various tactics in an attempt to appear more legitimate to potential students.

Some diploma mills claim accreditation by an accreditation mill while referring to themselves as being &quot;fully accredited&quot;. Accreditation mills based in the United States may model their websites after real accrediting agencies overseen by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Another typical ploy is for mills to claim to be internationally recognized by organizations such as UNESCO. UNESCO has no authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies, and has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.

Some diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating unrecognized accrediting bodies as well. These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, and previous learning, and may even require the submission of a dissertation or thesis in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy.

As diploma mills are typically licensed to do business, it is common practice within the industry to misrepresent their business license as indicating government approval of the institution. Promotional materials may use words denoting a legal status such as &quot;licensed&quot;, &quot;state authorized&quot;, or &quot;state-approved&quot; to suggest an equivalence to accreditation.

Some advertise other indicators of authenticity that are not relevant to academic credentials. For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are &quot;attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed notary&quot;. In reality notarization only certifies that the document was signed by the person named.

Diploma mills are frequently named to sound confusingly similar to those of prestigious accredited academic institutions. Despite the fact that trademark law is intended to prevent this situation, diploma mills continue to employ various methods to avoid legal recourse. Several diploma mills have adopted British-sounding names, similar but not identical to the names of legitimate universities, apparently to take advantage of the United Kingdom&#x27;s reputation for educational quality in other parts of the world. Some examples of British-sounding names used by diploma mills are &quot;Shaftesbury University&quot;, &quot;University of Dunham&quot;, &quot;Redding University&quot;, and &quot;Suffield University&quot;.

The school&#x27;s website may well not have an .edu domain, or other country-specific equivalent, since registration of such names is typically restricted. However, enforcement has sometimes been less restrictive, and an .edu domain cannot be taken as verification of school quality or reputation. Some diploma mills use an .ac top-level domain name, which resembles genuine second-level academic domain names like ac.uk but is in fact the ccTLD for Ascension Island. To prevent misuse of their names in this way, some legitimate academic institutions have registered .ac domains.

===Teaching===
Compared to legitimate institutions, diploma mills tend to have drastically lowered academic requirements, if any at all. Depending on the institution, students may be required to purchase textbooks, take tests, and submit homework, but degrees are commonly conferred after little or no study.

Instead of &quot;hard sciences&quot;, where competence is easier to verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often esoteric and may be based on a pseudoscience like astrology or naturopathy. Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult.

Degree mills typically offer little or no interaction with professors. Even if comments and corrections to coursework are given, they may have no bearing on the degree which is awarded. In other cases professors may serve only to write compliments to the student that can be given as references.

===Facilities===
Since diploma mills provide little in the way of teaching, there is usually no need for teaching facilities. The school tends to have no library, personnel, publications or research. In short, very little that is tangible can be found about the institution. If teaching is offered, the professors may themselves hold advanced degrees from the diploma mill itself or from other unaccredited institutions. They may also sport legitimate qualifications that are unrelated to the subject they teach.

Doctoral theses and dissertations from the institution will not be available from University Microfilms International, a national repository, or even the institution&#x27;s own library, if it has one. The address given by a diploma mill is often a postal box, mail forwarding service or suite number. There are legitimate distance learning institutions with limited facilities, however, but legitimate universities make their authority clear. For academics, publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals are important for establishing scientific credentials. However, in diploma mills, the research is either absent, fake or purely self-published without any external review. This may be hard to spot, since fake journals also exist. Faculty pages with bios and research may even be stolen from legitimate universities.

===Promotion and fees===
Buyers often use the diplomas to claim academic credentials for use in securing employment. For example, a schoolteacher might buy a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to superintendent. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months from the time of enrollment, and back-dating is possible. Academic credit may be offered for &quot;life experience,&quot; a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution. This should not be confused with legitimate programs offering recognition of prior learning, which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; in most cases, a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results.

Tuition and fees are charged on a per-degree basis rather than by term or by course. Diploma mills are often advertised using e-mail spam or other questionable methods. Legitimate institutions use traditional advertising and high school recruitment. Prospective students are encouraged to &quot;enroll now&quot; before tuition or fees are increased. They may be told that they qualify for a fellowship, scholarship or grant, or offered deals to sign up for multiple degrees at the same time. Promotional literature might contain grammatical and spelling errors, words in Latin, extravagant or pretentious language, and sample diplomas. Some schools&#x27; websites may look amateurish or unprofessional, although other diploma mills use appealing websites.

==Legal considerations==
Degrees and diplomas issued by diploma mills have been used to obtain employment, raises, or clients. Even if issuing or receiving a diploma mill qualification is legal, passing it off as an accredited one for personal gain is a crime in many jurisdictions. In some cases the diploma mill may itself be guilty of an offense, if it knew or ought to have known that the qualifications it issues are used for fraudulent purposes. Diploma mills could also be guilty of fraud if they mislead customers into believing that the qualifications they issue are accredited or recognized, or make false claims that they will lead to career advancement, and accept money on the basis of these claims.

Similar to tax havens, diploma mills frequently employ jurisdiction shopping, operating in another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or prosecution is unlikely. Splitting the business across jurisdictions can be a way to avoid authorities. A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.

Author John Bear, a distance learning and diploma mills expert, has written that fake degrees are risky for buyers and consumers:

:It is like putting a time bomb in your résumé. It could go off at any time, with dire consequences. The people who sell fake degrees will probably never suffer at all, but the people who buy them often suffer mightily. And – particularly if their &quot;degree&quot; is health-related – their clients may be seriously harmed.

===Australia===
In Australia, it is a criminal offence to call an institution a university, or issue university degrees, without authorisation through an act of federal or state parliaments.

Under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, corporations wishing to use the term &quot;university&quot; require approval from the relevant government minister, the Minister for Education ().

The corporate regulator Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) places strict controls on corporations wishing to use the term &quot;university&quot; and if the applicant does not intend to provide education services the name must not imply a connection with an existing university.

The Corporations Regulations 2001 lists the 39 academic organisations permitted to use the title &quot;university&quot;.

The use of higher education terms (such as &quot;degree&quot;) is protected in state legislation, e.g. Higher Education (Qld) Act 2003.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
According to the laws on higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina the terms &quot;university&quot;, &quot;faculty&quot;, &quot;academy&quot; and &quot;university of applied sciences&quot; can be used only by accredited educational institutions. Accreditation is independently assessed by the Agency for Development of Higher Education and Quality Assurance and formally conferred by the Ministry of Education and Science for each canton, entity or district. Only these institutions are allowed to award academic degrees and diplomas.

Illegal use of academic titles or academic degrees and &quot;non-accredited diplomas&quot; may lead to prosecution, conviction, fines or even imprisonment.

===Canada===

In Canada education, including higher education, falls under the jurisdiction of provincial and territorial governments. Many of the public universities are established by provincial legislation which also confers degree granting authority upon the institution. However, private postsecondary institutions are also required to comply with applicable legislation in order to confer degrees and diplomas.

Provincial or regional quality assurance bodies oversee education at a regional level, and there is no federal oversight. For example, in Ontario the &quot;Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000&quot; regulates degree-granting authority. Any institution that wishes to offer a degree or use the term &quot;university&quot; must be authorized to do so under an Act of the Legislature or by the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities. A list of recognized Canadian higher education institutions is available on the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials website.

The topic of diploma mills in Canada has been covered by the popular media since the 1970s, including in-depth investigations by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), news coverage by the Canadian Press and other mainstream media.

===China===
Most, but not all, universities and colleges in the People&#x27;s Republic of China are public institutions. The Ministry of Education, which has legal authority to regulate college enrollment and degree awarding, publishes a yearly list of qualified higher-education institutions. Institutions not on the list cannot admit students or award degrees.

Also, no institution may call itself a &quot;university&quot; or &quot;college&quot; without approval by a provincial-level education department. Any institution, public or private, which wishes to name itself after a geographic region larger than a province (e.g. &quot;South China ... University&quot;) must go through the Ministry of Education. A new regulation forbids any new university or college from being named &quot;national&quot;, &quot;of China&quot; or similar names.

, China has 210 diploma mills.

===Denmark===
Most universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are self-governing, but financed by the state. However, some schools, like Det Nødvendige Seminarium in Tvind provide a degree program that is accredited by the Ministry of Education in Mozambique and the Southern African Development Community.

===Finland===
All universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are public institutions or foundations, and vocational universities are municipal organs. There are no private higher educational institutions and no legal mechanism to found or accredit any. Universities are explicitly defined in the Universities Act. Other than universities proper, technical universities (known in Finland as AMK, ammattikorkeakoulu), officially called &quot;Universities of Applied Sciences&quot; in English, can be established with permission from the cabinet. The degrees are protected by law. The list of AMKs can be viewed from the Ministry of Education website.

For purposes of professional qualification, the use of foreign degree qualifications is regulated: if the name of a degree can be confused with a Finnish degree that requires more academic credit, the confusion must be eliminated. Several diploma mills have operated in Finland, and countermeasures in university admissions have become necessary. There are no laws against conferring unaccredited degrees or degrees accredited abroad, as long as a Finnish degree or equivalent is not claimed. Also, English terms like &quot;Bachelor&quot; or &quot;Doctor&quot; are not protected.

===Germany===
In Germany, it is a criminal offense to call an institution a &quot;Universität&quot; (university) or &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;, or to issue academic degrees, without authorization through an act of the respective state&#x27;s Ministry of Education. It is also a misdemeanor to falsely claim a degree in Germany if it is not accredited, see &quot;:de:Missbrauch von Titeln, Berufsbezeichnungen und Abzeichen&quot;.

Some corporate training programs in Germany use the English term &quot;corporate university&quot;. Such use of the term is tolerated since it is widely understood that such programs are not actual universities. Similarly, &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; frequently use the English term &quot;university of applied science&quot;. Neither are permitted to use the German word &quot;Universität&quot;.

===Greece===
Institutions of higher Tertiary education &quot;Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα (ΑΕΙ)&quot; (universities and technical universities) and &quot;Ανώτατα Τεχνολογικά Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα (ΑΤΕΙ)&quot; (technological educational institutes / universities of applied sciences) in Greece are fully self-managed public entities and are the only institutions that can issue university diplomas. Diplomas issued by foreign educational institutions are validated and assessed by the Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC).

===Hong Kong===
It is illegal under Hong Kong laws chapter 320 &quot;Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance&quot; section 8 to call an organisation a &quot;university&quot; without approval from the Chief Executive in Council.

Under Hong Kong laws chapter 200 &quot;Crimes Ordinance&quot; section 73, anyone who knowingly uses false documents with the intention of inducing somebody to accept them as genuine is liable to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment. Section 76 assigns the same penalty for anyone who makes or possesses machines that create such false documents.

===India===
The University Grants Commission (UGC) states, in section 22 of the University Grants Commission Act of 1956:
UGC has published a warning dated July 2012 against Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) about the unrecognized status of IIPM.

===Ireland===
Legitimate higher education qualifications in Ireland are placed on, or formally aligned, with the National Framework of Qualifications. This framework was established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act (1999). It is illegal under the Universities Act (1997) for any body offering higher education services to use the term &quot;university&quot; without the permission of the Minister for Education and Science. It is likewise illegal under the Institutes of Technologies Acts (1992–2006) to use the term &quot;institute of technology&quot; or &quot;regional technology college&quot; without permission.

===Italy===
All public and private universities and higher education institutions must be established, or specifically recognized, by decree of the Italian Minister of Education, University and Research; any other institution or organization is therefore not recognized and unaccredited.

===Japan===
Under Article 135 of the School Education Act, all universities and post-secondary education institutes in Japan require a government-issued licence from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Operating such an institute without a licence from MEXT can result in a fine of ¥100,000 for each offence committed. In addition, the National Institution for Academic Degrees and Quality Enhancement of Higher Education (NIAD-QE) has the sole authority to accredit all university and post-secondary qualifications in Japan, as per Article 104 of the School Education Act.

The &quot;Patent University&quot; was an example of a Japanese diploma mill which operated from 1964 until it was shut down in 1980, and which sold fraudulent doctorates for sums ranging between ¥300,000 and ¥5 million. In 2007, MEXT revealed that it had discovered 48 people with suspected falsified qualifications who were successfully hired to teach in 43 universities and post-secondary education institutes throughout Japan between 2004 and 2006.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the Education Act 1996 protects the status of the terms &quot;university&quot;, &quot;university college&quot; and &quot;branch campus&quot;. Only institutions with this status may award academic degrees.

The Private Higher Education Institutions act also places restrictions on the creation and operation of any private higher education institution that conducts any course of study or training programme for which a certificate, diploma or degree is awarded.
Furthermore, all legitimate higher education qualifications are placed on or formally affiliated with the Malaysian Qualifications Framework under the provisions of the Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007. Limited exemptions are however granted to organizations and institutions &quot;where the teaching is confined exclusively to the teaching of any religion&quot; or &quot;any place declared by the Minister by notification in the Gazette not to be an educational institution&quot; under the Education Act 1996.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, Under the Education Act the official recognition of studies (RVOE) educational programs offered by private institutions may be granted by the federal education authority, by state education authorities or by both. There are also public institutions of higher education, which are mandated to incorporate programs of these institutions according to its own rules. As of July 10, 2000, the Ministry applied for the granting of RVOE the guidelines established in the &quot;Secretarial Agreement No. 279 establishing the processes and procedures related to the recognition of official validity of studies The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) lists several institutions that are unaccredited in Mexico.

In August 2010, the Secretariat said 22 federal health officials were arrested after their medical and psychology licenses turned out to be fakes from a diploma mill according to the newspaper &quot;El Universal&quot;. They included the technical director of the National Center for Blood Transfusions and the chief medical officer of the National Commission for Medical Arbitration, which rules on cases of malpractice.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands it is illegal for non-accredited, non-recognized institutes to bestow any legally protected academic title. The NVAO is the only agency allowed to accredit courses. Since the implementation of the Bologna process, Dutch universities have started to bestow the English titles MSc and PhD instead of their Dutch equivalents. These English versions of the title are not protected under Dutch law. A diploma mill may thus bestow someone with a PhD title without violating Dutch law, but the recipient will not be allowed to use the protected titles &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;dr.&quot;

Partnerships with foreign educational institutions are possible. This is called the &quot;U-bocht construction&quot;. In this case, the curricula are neither accredited by NVAO nor recognized by the Dutch Department of Education. Graduates receive a foreign diploma issued by the educational institution which has a partnership with a Dutch educational institution. The status of such a diploma depends upon the laws and accreditation system of the country where the diploma is granted.

Diplomas from accredited universities are accepted in the Netherlands since the Bologna protocol. Diploma&#x27;s from non EU institutions must be screened and validated first before they are accepted for appointments requiring a validated starting level (e.g. entering a health profession).

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Education Act prohibits use of the terms &quot;degree&quot; and &quot;university&quot; by institutions other than the country&#x27;s eight accredited universities. In 2004 authorities announced their intention to take action against unaccredited schools using the words &quot;degree&quot; and &quot;university,&quot; including the University of Newlands, an unaccredited distance-learning provider based in the Wellington suburb of Newlands. Other unaccredited New Zealand institutions reported to be using the word &quot;university&quot; included the New Zealand University of Golf in Auckland, the online Tawa-Linden and Tauranga Universities of the Third Age, and the Southern University of New Zealand. Newlands owner Rochelle M. Forrester said she would consider removing the word &quot;university&quot; from the name of her institution in order to comply with the law.

===Nigeria===
The National University Commission (NUC) was formed in 1999 to clamp down on diploma mill activity in the country. A concentrated effort by the NUC has resulted in a significant drop in diploma mill activity in Nigeria. An International Higher Education article states, &quot;Attainment of the Nigerian vision of being one of the top 20 economies by 2020 will be compromised by the injection of such poor-quality graduates into the economy. Herein lies the distaste for and the &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for the government&#x27;s clampdown on degree mills.&quot;

In Nigeria, online degrees from unaccredited institutions are banned and should not be accepted by employers.

===Norway===
Accreditation of universities and other institutions of higher education (&quot;Universitet&quot;, &quot;Høyskole(Høgskole)&quot;), is governed by the state institution NOKUT, Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education. There have been cases where people submitting diplomas from a &quot;Diploma Mill&quot; to this agency for convalidation, have been prosecuted for fraud.

===Pakistan===
The government-established Higher Education Commission (HEC) is responsible for all matters related to the accreditation of universities in Pakistan. All recognized universities in Pakistan are listed on the HEC website. However, the
Axact company, based in Karachi, was the subject of a 2015 investigation by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which found it was committing fraud in other countries, by granting fake degrees and diplomas.

===Philippines===
Title IV (Crimes Against Public Interest), section V articles 174 and 175 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines criminalize the falsification of medical certificates, certificates of merit or service and the like. Article 174 imposes a penalty on anyone who produces such certificates and article 175 on anyone who knowingly procures and uses such a certificate. Despite this, news and magazine articles appear from time to time reporting businesses operating along Claro M. Recto Avenue in Manila which offer fake documents for sale.

===Portugal===
In Portugal according to Base Law of Educative System from 1973 Lei n.º 5/73 (Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo) the formal establishment of a diploma mill is impossible. To award higher studies degrees, all higher studies institutions require a governmental issued licence provided by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education and published in the Government Journal (Diário da República) and communicate to the High Studies General Board (Direção Geral do Ensino Superior - DGES) all record of grades and degree awarded by students. Acting otherwise is punishable by law. Previously to 2007, in the process of opening a new institution or new curriculum to be lectured, it was required to provide the degree content by science branch and the list of PhD, MSc and BSc professors that lecture that specific course, thus getting a licence without expiration date, mandatory professors or contents revision date. This created a series of controversial scandals and severe lack of educational quality and academic integrity in some private and public institutions as evidentiated by the 2007 state run inspection at the hands of A3ES, resulting in their compulsory closure and transfer of students to other institutions. Created by governmental rule to ensure the quality in higher studies along the Bologna Process implementation, this entity has a specific and rigorous agenda to control all public and private institutions of higher studies and its content. Its job is to perform inspections every 1, 2, 3 or 5 years about the academic staff&#x27;s scientific quality in every eligible educational institution, current and new curriculum in all degrees, assure that these are up to date, and control the BSc, MSc and PhD available degrees in Portugal, by closure or approval of new courses as the Bologna Process demands.

===Romania===
The Romanian newspaper &quot;Gândul&quot; has reported that the Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University from Bucharest started 34 Master&#x27;s degree curricula which have no legal ground. According to the rector of the university, Corina Dumitrescu, the law has a loophole, since it uses a continuous present for institutional evaluation, which is uncharacteristic of the Romanian language. She says that in her opinion institutional evaluation (required by law) may also happen after the curricula have been taught. The actual wording in Romanian is &quot;universitate acreditată supusă periodic evaluării instituționale&quot;, and Dumitrescu argues that &quot;care se supun&quot; means that an accredited institution can be evaluated &quot;today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow&quot; (and presumably, any time), not that it needs to have been evaluated in the past. For the study year 2010-2011, 16 Master&#x27;s curricula from nine of its faculties are listed as accredited in Order no. 4630/2010 of the Department of Education.

===Russia===
Apart from the graduate level diploma mills, in Russia a significant number of leading institutions have &quot;degree mills&quot; within their departments (typically humanities and economics). According to the civic initiative Dissernet such institutions are providing the Russian elite (heads of universities, members of parliament and government officials) with degrees based on plagiarised and falsified Kandidat nauk (Ph.D Candidate) and Doktor nauk (full Ph.D) theses.

===South Korea===
It is illegal to falsely claim a degree in South Korea if it is not accredited. In March 2006 prosecutors in Seoul were reported to have broken up a crime ring selling bogus music diplomas from Russia, which helped many land university jobs and seats in orchestras. People who falsely used these degrees were criminally charged.

In early 2007, Shin Jeong-ah (신정아) was criminally charged for forging and misusing a degree from Yale University. The case had a far-reaching impact as she was a professor at Dongguk University and also held a position at an art gallery known to have ties with economical and political figures.

===Spain===
In Spain, universities and syllabi must be accredited by the National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA). Furthermore, in order to apply for an academic rank, a professor must have their curriculum accredited for said rank by this agency.

===Sri Lanka===
Until 1999 only state universities could grant degrees, but amendments to the Universities Act now allow private institutions to be granted degree-awarding status by the University Grants Commission. Universities can also be established by an act of parliament.

===Sweden===
In June 2007, the Swedish Minister for Employment, Sven-Otto Littorin, was discovered to have an MBA degree from Fairfax University. Though aware that claiming an MBA from this diploma mill would be illegal in many states in the US, Littorin tried to convince the Swedish media and people of the legitimacy of his qualification. He was eventually forced to remove the reference from his official CV, but he remained in office.

===Switzerland===
Qualifications, diplomas and titles earned from Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Zurich, EPFL), from cantonal (state-run) universities, from private universities recognized by state authorities, and from Fachhochschule-institutions (Universities of Applied Sciences run or recognized by official authorities, federal and cantonal) are protected. Accreditation is conferred by the Conference of University Rectors of Switzerland (CRUS) and the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (OAQ). Under Swiss law, it is a criminal offense, under unfair competition legislation, to profit by any unfounded academic or occupational qualifications. The private use of such a title, however, is legal. Thus, one can call oneself an LL.M., but one must not use the title when competing for clients.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, degrees may only be awarded by institutions that have degree-awarding powers recognised by the UK authorities (the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly). Some institutions do not have degree-awarding powers but provide complete courses leading to recognised UK degrees that are validated by institutions which have degree-awarding powers. The UK authorities recognise those institutions which have been granted degree-awarding powers by either a royal charter, an Act of Parliament or the Privy Council. These degree-awarding institutions are known as &quot;recognised bodies.&quot; All UK universities and some higher education colleges are &quot;recognised bodies.&quot; If an institution is not a &quot;recognised body&quot; or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, it is likely to be a degree mill. It is an offence against section 214 of the Education Reform Act 1988 for any organisation to offer a degree qualification which could be taken to be that of a UK institution unless it is a &quot;recognised body.&quot; The UK Border Agency maintains a list of institutions licensed to sponsor migrant students so that overseas students can check that they are attending an appropriate institution, and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) maintain a directory of higher education providers regulated in England.

Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) is an initiative sponsored by HEFCE which aims to prevent higher education fraud in the UK by maintaining a list of UK degree-awarding bodies, including name changes, mergers and antecedents since 1990.

===United States===
In the United States, diploma mills were very common before 1920s. The country does not have a federal law that would unambiguously prohibit diploma mills, and the term &quot;university&quot; is not legally protected on a national level. The United States Department of Education lacks direct plenary authority to regulate schools and, consequently, the quality of an institution&#x27;s degree. However, the Federal Trade Commission works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices including those in the field of education and alerts United States&#x27; consumers about diploma mills by delineating some tell-tale signs in its official web page. Under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities on the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education that they accredit. Some degree mills have taken advantage of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by representing themselves as seminaries, since in many jurisdictions religious institutions can legally offer degrees in religious subjects without government regulation.

Medical diploma mills have operated and have been blacklisted in the United States.

Although the DipScam operation in the 1980s led to a decline in diploma mill activity across the United States, the lack of further action by law enforcement, uneven state laws, and the rise of the Internet have combined to reverse many of the gains made in previous years. In 2005, the US Department of Education launched its &quot;Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs&quot; website to combat the spread of fraudulent degrees. A number of states have passed bills restricting the ability of organizations to award degrees without accreditation. Jurisdictions that have restricted or made illegal the use of credentials from unaccredited schools include Oregon, Michigan, Maine, North Dakota, New Jersey, Washington, Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. Many other states are also considering restrictions on the use of degrees from unaccredited institutions.

== Research on diploma mills ==
Research into diploma mills remains limited. This is due, in part, to the clandestine nature of diploma mills and the companies that operate them. One of the most prominent investigators and educators on diploma mills and fake degrees is Allan Ezell, a now-retired FBI Special Agent who spent much of his career tracking down and prosecuting diploma mill operations in the United States. Ezell&#x27;s co-authored book Degree Mills, is one of the best-known books on the topic.

There are limited amount of academic scholars researching on the topic of diploma mills. Some notable researchers include Alan Contreras, George Gollin, Sarah Elaine Eaton and Jamie Carmichael.

Research into the topic of diploma mills has showed that higher education professionals, such as university registrars and admissions staff, are often poorly trained to identify fraudulent documents by diploma mills in admissions applications. Diploma mills have also been linked to frauds in admissions, English language proficiency testing, and varsity athletics in the United States.

<text>Duncan Alexander Goodhew, (born 27 May 1957) is an English former competitive swimmer. After swimming competitively in America as a collegian at North Carolina State University, he was an Olympic swimmer for Great Britain and won Olympic gold and bronze medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He also swam at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Goodhew attended Windlesham House School and Millfield School (Walton House).

He was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 13.

At the age of 15, he fell out of a tree, which triggered permanent hair loss due to alopecia universalis.

==Career==
Goodhew came to prominence as an international swimmer in 1976, finishing 7th in the 100m breaststroke at the Montreal Olympics that summer. Four years later, in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, he won gold in the 100m breaststroke, in a time of 1:03.34, and a bronze in the 4x100m medley relay. He represented England and won three silver medals in the breaststroke events and medley relay, at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. At the ASA National British Championships he won the 100 metres breaststroke title in 1976, 1978 and 1980 and the 200 metres breaststroke title in 1976, 1978 and 1980.

As an undergraduate swimmer at North Carolina State University in the mid-70&#x27;s, Goodhew was mentored by North Carolina State swimming Coach Don Easterling who led the team from 1971-1995. Coach Easterling&#x27;s North Carolina teams won twelve straight Atlantic Coast Conference Championships from 1971 through 1982.

Goodhew was selected by the British Bobsleigh Association to represent Great Britain at the 1981 European Championships.

He is also an author and motivational speaker. In 1983 he was appointed an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II for services to sport. In 1987 he participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;.

Goodhew&#x27;s 100m breaststroke gold medal achievement was ranked 99th in the British network Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Sporting Moments&quot; in 2002.

On 29 September 2001, Goodhew participated in an international relay off the coast of California from Santa Catalina Island to Santa Monica. Of the eight international relay teams participating, each team had one swimmer with MS. Goodhew swam on the same team as organizer and MS activist Taylor MH. Proceeds from fund-raising were all donated to the Myelin Project.

Goodhew has made a number of television appearances including featuring in several episodes of &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Important Astrology Experiment&quot;.

==Personal life==
Goodhew married Annie Patterson, an American graphic designer from North Carolina, in December 1984, and they have two children.

In 2000, Labour MP Robert Sheldon collapsed in the street and was revived by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by Goodhew who happened to be passing.

<doc id="551160" wikidata="Q4381482" url="?curid=551160" title="James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury">
<text>James Edward Hubert Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury, (23 October 1861 – 4 April 1947), known as Viscount Cranborne from 1868 to 1903, was a British politician.

==Background and education==
Born in London, Salisbury was the eldest son of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who served as British Prime Minister, by his wife Georgina (&quot;née&quot; Alderson). The Right Reverend Lord William Cecil, Lord Cecil of Chelwood and Lord Quickswood were his younger brothers, and Prime Minister Arthur Balfour his first cousin. He was educated at Eton and University College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1885.

==Political career==
As a teenager he accompanied his father to the 1876–1877 Constantinople Conference and a year later to the Congress of Berlin.

Lord Cranborne sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Darwen, then called North-East Lancashire, from 1885 to 1892. He lost his seat at the general election of the latter year. He was elected for Rochester at a by-election in 1893, continuing as MP there until 1903, when he succeeded his father and was elevated to the House of Lords.

On 29 October 1892, Lord Cranborne was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 4th (Militia) Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment, (formerly the Hertfordshire Militia) of which his father was Honorary Colonel and was in command when the battalion saw active service in South Africa from March to November 1900, during the Second Boer War. The battalion, numbering 24 officers and 483 men, left Queenstown on 27 February in the transport &quot;Goorkha&quot;, with Lord Cranborne as the senior officer in command, arriving in Cape Town the following month. He received the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his service during the war. In July 1902 he received the Honorary Freedom of the borough of Hertford in recognition of his service during the war. He was still in command of the battalion on the outbreak of World War I. He was also Colonel of the wartime Hertfordshire Volunteer Regiment and Hon Col of the 4th Battalion, Essex Regiment, of the Territorial Force. Lord Salisbury was ADC to Edward VII, and George V until 1929.

He served under his father and then his cousin Arthur Balfour as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1900 to 1903, under Balfour as Lord Privy Seal from 1903 to 1905, and as Lord President of the Board of Trade in 1905. In 1903 he was sworn of the Privy Council. In December 1908, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire. From 1906, following his uncle, he served as Chairman of the Canterbury House of Laymen.

Salisbury played a leading role in opposing David Lloyd George&#x27;s People&#x27;s Budget and the Parliament Bill of 1911. He commanded the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division in the UK from September 1915 to December 1916. He continued as a committed and eager member of the Territorial Army: he was Honorary Colonel of 86th (East Anglian) (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, and of 48th (South Midland) Divisional Engineers.

In 1917 he was made a Knight Companion of the Garter. He returned to the government in the 1920s and served under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1922 to 1923, as Lord President of the Council from 1922 to 1924, as Lord Privy Seal from 1924 to 1929 and as Leader of the House of Lords from 1925 to 1929 in successive Conservative governments of Bonar Law and Baldwin. He resigned as leader of the Conservative peers in June 1931 and became one of the most prominent opponents of Indian Home Rule in the Lords, supporting the campaign waged in the House of Commons by Winston Churchill against the Home Rule legislation.

Salisbury was part of two parliamentary deputations which called on the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, in the autumn of 1936 to remonstrate with them about the slow pace of British rearmament in the face of the growing threat from Nazi Germany. The delegation was led by Sir Austen Chamberlain, a former Foreign Secretary and its most prominent speakers included Winston Churchill, Leo Amery and Roger Keyes. The Marquess of Salisbury was Lord High Steward at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Salisbury married Lady Cicely Alice Gore (born 15 July 1867, died 5 February 1955), second daughter of Arthur Gore, 5th Earl of Arran, on 17 May 1887 at St. Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster. Between 1907 and 1910 she served as a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Alexandra; additionally she was appointed an Officer of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, and as a Justice of the Peace for Hertfordshire.

The couple had four children:

* Lady Beatrice Edith Mildred Gascoyne-Cecil (born 10 August 1891, died 1980), married William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech.
* Robert Arthur James Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury (born 27 August 1893, died 23 February 1972).
* Lady Mary Alice Gascoyne-Cecil (born 29 July 1895, died 24 December 1988), married Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire.
* Lord Edward Christian David Gascoyne-Cecil, CH (known as Lord David Cecil) (born 9 April 1902, died 1 January 1986).

Lord Salisbury died in April 1947, at 85, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Robert. The Marchioness of Salisbury died in February 1955.

He was the grandfather of actor Jonathan Cecil by his youngest son, David.

<text>Paul Louis Adrien Henri Hymans (23 March 1865 – 8 March 1941), was a Belgian politician associated with the Liberal Party. He was the second president of the League of Nations and served again as its president in 1932–1933.

==Life==
Hymans was the son of the Belgian writer and historian Louis Hymans, himself the son of a Jewish doctor originally from Dordrecht, and Louise de l&#x27;Escaille, a Christian Protestant Belgian Walloon. His mother came from an old aristocratic Belgian Walloon family. He became a lawyer and professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. As a politician, he became Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, holding this post from 1918 to 1920 (and again from 1927 to 1935), was Minister of Justice from 1926 to 1927 and member of the Council of Ministers from 1935 to 1936. In 1919, together with Charles de Broqueville and Emile Vandervelde he introduced universal suffrage for all men (&quot;one man, one vote&quot;) and compulsory education.

As foreign minister during the Great War, Hymans was successful in securing promises from the Allies that amounted to co-belligerency. Britain, France and Russia pledged in the Declaration of Sainte-Adresse in February 1916 that Belgium would be included in the peace negotiations, its independence would be restored and it would receive monetary compensation from Germany for the damage. When the war began, Hymans also received major promises of relief support from the United States that were approved by President Woodrow Wilson. Relief was directed primarily by the American Herbert Hoover and involved several agencies: the Commission for Relief in Belgium, American Relief Administration, and Comité National de Secours et d&#x27;Alimentation. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Belgium officially ended its longtime neutral status and became the first in line to receive reparations payments from Germany. However, Belgium received only a bit of German territory and was rejected in its demands for all of Luxembourg and part of the Netherlands. However, it was given colonial mandates over the German colonies of Rwanda and Burundi. Hymans was the leading spokesman for the small countries at Paris and became the president of the first assembly of the new League of Nations. He helped to form the customs union of Belgium and Luxembourg (Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union) in 1921 and played a leading part in negotiating the Dawes Plan in 1924. In 1928, he signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact for Belgium.

A Protestant and a freemason, he was a member of the lodge &quot;Les Amis Philanthropes&quot; of the Grand Orient of Belgium in Brussels. He is interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.

<doc id="551176" wikidata="Q2033651" url="?curid=551176" title="Passion Sunday">
<text>Passion Sunday is the fifth Sunday in Lent, marking the beginning of Passiontide. In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church deleted Passiontide from the liturgical calendar of the Mass of Paul VI, but it is still observed in the Church by those who keep the Extraordinary Form and Personal Ordinariates, and outside it by some Anglicans and Lutherans.

In Scotland, the day is known as Care Sunday.

==Fifth Sunday in Lent==

Until 1959, the fifth Sunday in Lent was officially known in the Roman Catholic Church as “Passion Sunday”. It marked the beginning of a two-week-long period known as Passiontide, which is still observed by Catholics who attend the Extraordinary Form or of Anglican Ordinariates, as well as Western Rite Orthodox Christians, and various denominations in Protestantism. 

In 1960, Pope John XXIII&#x27;s Code of Rubrics changed the name of that Sunday to “First Sunday of the Passion”, bringing the name into harmony with the name that Pope Pius XII gave five years earlier to the sixth Sunday in Lent, “Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday”.

Pope Paul VI in 1969 removed a distinction that existed (although with overlap) between Lent and Passiontide, which began with the fifth Sunday in Lent. The distinction, explicit in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, predates it. He deleted the reference to the Passion from the fifth Sunday in Lent.

Although Passiontide as a distinct liturgical season was abolished, the Roman Rite liturgy continues to bring the Passion of Christ to mind, from Monday of the fifth week in Lent onward, through the choice of hymns, the use on the weekdays of the fifth week of Lent of Preface I of the Passion of the Lord, with Preface II of the Passion of the Lord being used on the first three weekdays of Holy Week, and the authorization of the practice of covering crosses and images from the fifth Sunday in Lent onward, if the Conference of Bishops so permits. Where this practice is followed, crucifixes remain covered until the end of the Good Friday celebration of the Lord’s Passion; statues remain covered until the Easter Vigil.

The entrance antiphon of the Mass on the fifth Sunday in Lent begins with the word &quot;&quot;Iudica&quot; (older spelling, &quot;Judica&quot;&quot;). This provides another name for the day: &quot;Iudica Sunday&quot; or &quot;Judica Sunday&quot;, similar to the name &quot;Laetare Sunday&quot; for the fourth Sunday. Due to of the custom of veiling crucifixes and statues before Mass on the fifth Sunday in Lent, this Sunday was called “Black Sunday” in Germany where the veils were black, which elsewhere were generally purple.

Those who continue to observe earlier forms of the Roman Rite or of liturgies modelled on it refer to the fifth Sunday in Lent by one or other of its previous names.

===Lutheran readings===

The historical readings for the fifth Sunday in Lent in the Lutheran tradition are Genesis 12:1–3, Hebrews 9:11–15, John 8:46–59, and Psalm 43. I Corinthians 1:21–31 and Matthew 26:17–29 are alternate readings.

The three-year lectionary appoints the following readings for the fifth Sunday in Lent:

*Psalm
**A: 116:1–9
**B: 51:10–15
**C: 28:1–9
*1st Lesson
**A: Ezekiel 37:1–14
**B: Jeremiah 31:31–34
**C: Isaiah 43:16–21
*2nd Lesson
**A: Romans 8:11–19
**B: Hebrews 5:7–9
**C: Philippians 3:8–14
*Gospel
**A: John 11:47-53/1-53
**B: John 12:20–33
**C: Luke 20:9–19

==Sixth Sunday in Lent==

In the Roman Rite, the Gospel reading at the Mass of the sixth Sunday in Lent is an account in one of the Synoptic Gospels of the Passion of Christ. Until 1969, the lesson was always the account from the Gospel of Matthew: the whole of chapters 26 and 27 (). In the 1955 reforms, this was trimmed to while for priests celebrating a second or a third Mass on that day, to just . Since 1970, the revised Roman Missal has been using a three-year cycle in which the accounts of Matthew ( or ), Mark ( or ) and Luke ( or ) are alternated in successive years.

<doc id="551182" wikidata="Q6240584" url="?curid=551182" title="John Hynes (politician)">
<text>John Bernard Hynes (September 22, 1897 – January 6, 1970), was an American politician who served as the mayor of Boston from 1950 to 1960.

==Career==
Hynes began his career at city hall in 1920 as a clerk in the health department. He later transferred to the auditing department and was chief clerk in the Mayor&#x27;s office during James Michael Curley&#x27;s 1922 to 1926 term. On January 4, 1926, Hynes became the city&#x27;s assistant budget commissioner. He earned his high school and college diplomas through evening classes, graduating from Suffolk University Law School in 1927. On June 18, 1929, he was appointed assistant city clerk. In August 1943, Hynes was commissioned a Major in the United States Army. He was discharged that December due to a reoccurrence of a chronic ear issue and returned to the city clerk&#x27;s office. On September 1, 1945, he became Boston&#x27;s city clerk.

On June 26, 1947, Mayor James Michael Curley was sentenced to six to eighteen months in prison for mail fraud. The city charter allowed the president of the city council to serve as acting mayor in the mayor&#x27;s absence, but his powers were limited unless the mayor was deceased. The Massachusetts General Court passed emergency legislation to bypass council president John B. Kelly, who had recently been acquitted on bribery charges and was in ill health, and to grant full mayoral powers to Hynes (who as city clerk was second in the line of succession) until Curley&#x27;s release from prison.

Curley, upon his return from prison, commented to the press, &quot;I have accomplished more in one day than has been done in the five months of my absence.&quot; Stung by this off-hand but disparaging comment about his performance as acting mayor, Hynes decided to challenge Curley in the November 1949 election, and defeated him.

Because of a change to the mayoral election system, the next election was held in November 1951, when Hynes again defeated Curley. Hynes faced Curley a third time in the 1955 mayoral race; Curley was eliminated in the preliminary election, and Hynes defeated John E. Powers in the general election. Overall, Hynes served as mayor from January 2, 1950, until January 4, 1960.

Hynes served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 1955 through 1957.

Mayor Hynes later served as Massachusetts&#x27; Commissioner of Banks from 1963-1967. 

Hynes died on January 6, 1970, at Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Boston.

==Legacy==
During his tenure as mayor, he oversaw the opening of the Central Artery elevated highway through the city&#x27;s waterfront district, as well as the opening of the Freedom Trail, which traces many of Boston&#x27;s Revolutionary War era landmarks. He was responsible for founding the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), which laid the foundation for developments in Boston in the 1950s and beyond including the controversial razing of the West End. Hynes and his successors, John Collins and Kevin White, are most responsible for the modernization of the city of Boston. The Hynes Convention Center, located in the Back Bay section of Boston, is named for him. One son, Jack Hynes, was a longtime Boston news anchor. His second child, Marie &quot;Darby&quot; Hynes Gallagher, was a special education teacher in the Boston city school system. Another son, Richard Hynes, taught at Boston University. A third son, Barry T. Hynes, served on the Boston City Council and was Boston&#x27;s city clerk. His daughter, Nancy, passed in her forties due to illness.

<doc id="551197" wikidata="Q333205" url="?curid=551197" title="Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury">
<text>Robert Arthur James Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury (27 August 1893 – 23 February 1972), known as Viscount Cranborne from 1903 to 1947, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background==
Nicknamed &quot;Bobbety&quot;, Salisbury was the eldest son of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury, by his wife Lady Cicely Gore, daughter of the 5th Earl of Arran, and the grandson of the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, Prime Minister 1895–1902. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, receiving an honorary Doctorate of Civil Laws in 1951.

==Military career==
Salisbury served in the Army during the First World War. He was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards (SR) in 1915 and served until the war&#x27;s end. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre and Chevalier Order of the Crown of Belgium. When the war ended, he worked at the Westminster Bank. In 1928, he was appointed a director and to the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts; he was promoted to chairman of the commission in 1957.

==Political career==
Salisbury, as Viscount Cranborne, was elected as a Conservative to the House of Commons as MP for South Dorset in 1929. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Lord Privy Seal in 1934 in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s National Government, he was promoted serving as Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1938. He was made Paymaster General by Winston Churchill in May 1940 for the duration of the Battle of Britain but was appointed Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs from 1940 to 1942.

In 1941, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in one of his father&#x27;s titles as Baron Cecil of Essendon. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies in February–November 1942, Lord Privy Seal between 1942 and 1943, Leader of the House of Lords between 1942 and 1945 and again Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs between 1943 and 1945. As a friend of Churchill, in 1943, he was appointed President of the English-Speaking Union to promote the universality of the language throughout the British Empire. His final wartime appointment was as President of the University College of the South West for a statutory ten years before it was converted to university status.

In 1947, King George VI made Salisbury a Knight of the Order of the Garter, and he succeeded his father in the marquessate shortly afterwards. He became High Steward of Hertfordshire, where he lived, in 1947, shortly before the office was abolished.

During the 1950s, when his party returned to office, successively, he served Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan as Lord Privy Seal from 1951 to 1952; Leader of the House of Lords from 1951 to 1957; Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in 1952 and Lord President of the Council from December 1952 to 1957. During the period of the coronation of Elizabeth II, he was appointed Acting Foreign Secretary, as Eden was then seriously ill after a series of botched operations on his bile duct.

In November 1951, he received an honorary doctorate of law from the University of Liverpool.

Lord Salisbury was known as a hardline imperialist. In 1952, as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, he tried to make permanent the exile of Seretse Khama, &quot;kgosi&quot; (leader) of the Bamangwato people in Bechuanaland, for marrying a white British woman. During the 1960s, Lord Salisbury continued to be a staunch defender of the white-dominated governments in South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and was granted the Freedom of the City of Salisbury (which had been named after his grandfather) on a visit in 1956. He was also a fierce opponent of liberal-left attempts to reform the House of Lords, but he created what is known as the Salisbury Convention, under which the House of Lords will not oppose the second or third reading of any government legislation promised in its election manifesto.

In January 1957, Eden resigned as prime minister. The two candidates were Rab Butler and Harold Macmillan. The Queen took advice from Winston Churchill (who backed Macmillan), Edward Heath (who, as Chief Whip, was aware of backbench opinion), and Salisbury, who interviewed the Cabinet one by one and with his famous speech impediment, asked each one whether he was for &quot;Wab or Hawold&quot; (it is thought that only between one and three were for &quot;Wab&quot;). To the surprise of the media, the advice was overwhelmingly to appoint Macmillan as Prime Minister instead of Butler.

Lord Salisbury resigned from his position as Leader of the House of Lords in opposition to the Government&#x27;s decision to release Archbishop Makarios from his detention in Seychelles. Makarios, the Archbishop of Cyprus, had been arrested because the British perceived that he was encouraging inter-communal violence and terrorism in Cyprus during the so-called &#x27;Cyprus Question&#x27;. He became the first president of the Conservative Monday Club in January 1962, when he stated &quot;there was never a greater need for true conservatism than there is today&quot;. He held the post until his death in 1972.

Salisbury&#x27;s cultural pursuits were recognised when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Arts that year. These artistic credentials were enhanced as a Trustee of the National Gallery from 1960 to 1966.

Apart from his political career, Salisbury was Chancellor of the University of Liverpool from 1951 until 1971. In 1970, students at the university staged an occupation at Senate House to demand his removal over his support for apartheid and other views.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Salisbury married Elizabeth Vere Cavendish, daughter of Lord Richard Cavendish (grandson of the 7th Duke of Devonshire) and his wife Lady Moyra de Vere Beauclerk (a daughter of The 10th Duke of St Albans), on 8 December 1915. They had three sons, two of whom predeceased their parents:

* Robert Edward Peter Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury (born 24 October 1916, died 11 July 2003)
* Michael Charles James Gascoyne-Cecil (born 27 October 1918, died 27 October 1934)
* Richard Hugh Vere Gascoyne-Cecil (born 31 January 1924, a Sergeant Pilot in the RAF who was killed in action on 12 August 1944 during the Second World War.

Lord Salisbury died in February 1972, at 78, and was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son, Robert, who became the 6th Marquess. Lady Salisbury died on 5 June 1982.

==Media portrayal==
He is portrayed by Clive Francis in the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

<doc id="551204" wikidata="Q552389" url="?curid=551204" title="Spyros Kyprianou">
<text>Spyros Achilleos Kyprianou (; 28 October 1932 – 12 March 2002) was a Cypriot barrister and politician, who served as President of Cyprus from 1977 to 1988. He also served as President of the Cypriot House of Representatives from 1976 to 1977 and then again from 1996 to 2001, as well as being President of the Democratic Party, which he founded, from 1976 to 2000.

As President, he considerably expanded Cyprus&#x27; presence on the international stage. He entered office in acting capacity following the death of President Makarios III in 1977, before being elected unopposed for the rest of Makarios&#x27; term in the resulting by-election the following month. He was elected for the next full term in 1978, again unopposed, and re-elected for a second full term 1983, but lost his bid to secure a third full term in 1988.

==Early life and education==
Kyprianou was born in Limassol in 1932. His father came from a multi-child family from Lefkara, while his mother was a member of Araouzos political family from Limassol. He studied Economics and Commerce at the City of London College and law at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He also studied comparative law, receiving a diploma.

==Political career==
During the time he spent in London as a student, Kyprianou founded the National Union of Cypriot Students in England (E.F.E.K.A.) of which he was the first president. In 1952 he was appointed secretary of Archbishop Makarios III in London and in 1954 he assumed responsibility for the Office of the Secretary of the Cyprus Ethnarchy in London, the major objective of which was to inform British public opinion on the Cyprus issue. This effort was intensified after the start of the liberation struggle in Cyprus in 1955. Due to this activity, he was forced to leave the UK in June 1956 and went to Greece. There, he collaborated with the Panhellenic Committee for Self-Determination for Cyprus which aimed to raise the profile of the Cyprus case on the international scene.

From August 1956 to March 1957, Kyprianou represented the Cyprus Ethnarchy in New York. Later, he was allowed to return to his London post as representative of the Cyprus Ethnarchy. He stayed in London until the signing of the London – Zurich Agreements for the independence of Cyprus and returned to Cyprus with Archbishop Makarios in March 1959.

During the transitional period after the signing of the agreements on Cyprus, Kyprianou represented the Greek Cypriot side at the Athens Conference for the drafting of the Agreement on the Application of the Tripartite Alliance (Cyprus – Greece – Turkey), this was provided for in the London – Zurich Agreements.

After the declaration of the independence of Cyprus in August 1960, the president of the Republic of Cyprus Archbishop Makarios appointed Kyprianou Minister of Justice and, a few days later, Minister of Foreign Affairs.

As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he repeatedly represented Cyprus at the UN Security Council, and in sessions of the U.N. General Assembly during debates on the Cyprus issue. He also participated in meetings of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, of which he served as chairman from April to December 1967. In addition, he visited countries and represented Cyprus in negotiations with foreign governments.

In September 1964, in Moscow, he signed the Agreement for Soviet Military Aid to Cyprus.

He resigned from his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 5 May 1972, after a dispute with the military regime in Athens.

After this resignation, he worked as a lawyer and a legal counsellor. On 1 August 1974, following the coup of the Greek junta and the Turkish invasion in Cyprus, Kyprianou went to Athens where he had talks with the Government of National Unity, which took over following the collapse of the junta. He travelled between Athens and London where President Makarios was staying temporarily. In September 1974, he headed the Cyprus delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations during the debate on Cyprus. In February 1975, he attended the Security Council meeting in New York as member of the Cyprus delegation.

On 12 May 1976, he announced the establishment of the Democratic Party. In the parliamentary elections of 5 September 1976, the Democratic Party won 21 seats out of a total of 35 in the House of Representatives, and Kyprianou was elected President of the House.

After the death of the president of the Republic Archbishop Makarios on 3 August 1977, Kyprianou became acting president of the Republic, in accordance with the constitution. A presidential election had been set for 10 September 1977 to fill the remainder of the term of Makarios. Kyrprianou filed for the office before the 31 August deadline for nomination. The expense of an election proved unnecessary however, and the press noted on 31 August, &quot;He was the only candidate nominated for the post by the noon deadline today. Because no one opposed Kyprianou&#x27;s candidacy, an election scheduled for Septe. 10 was canceled.&quot;

Kyprianou&#x27;s elder son Achilles was kidnapped by members of EOKA on the evening of 14 December 1977. Achilles was later released on 18 December.

In the presidential elections of 28 February 1978, and 13 February 1983, he was reelected as President of the Republic, the first time being elected unopposed. He was defeated by George Vassiliou at the elections in 1988.

As President of the Republic of Cyprus, he visited many countries and participated in sessions of the United Nations, as well as summit conferences of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth of Nations.

Kyprianou was awarded medals of honour, distinctions and decorations by various countries. In 1985, the University of Belgrade awarded him an honorary doctorate.

Following the parliamentary elections of 26 May 1996, Kyprianou was elected President of the House of Representatives. He stepped down in 2001, ending a 30-year career in politics.

==Family==
Kyprianou married Mimi Pagathrokliton in 1956 and had two sons, Achilleas and Markos. His second son, Markos Kyprianou, served as a European Commissioner from 2004 to 2008 and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cyprus.

==Death==
Spyros Kyprianou died on 12 March 2002 after a long fight with cancer. He was survived by his wife, Mimi Pagathrokliton, and their two sons. His widow, former first lady Mimi Kyprianou, died on 22 November 2021.

Spyrou Kyprianou Avenue () in Nicosia was named after him posthumously, as well as a plethora of other streets across the island.

<doc id="551210" wikidata="Q9025145" url="?curid=551210" title="Luis Kutner">
<text>Luis Kutner (June 9, 1908 – March 1, 1993), was a US human rights activist, FBI informant, and lawyer who was on the National Advisory Council of the US branch of Amnesty International during its early years and created the concept of a living will. He was also notable for his advocacy of &quot;world &quot;habeas corpus&quot;&quot;, the development of an international writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to protect individual human rights. He was a founder of World Habeas Corpus, an organization created to fight for international policies which would protect individuals against unwarranted imprisonment. Kutner&#x27;s papers are at the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University.

== Biography ==
Luis Kutner was born in Chicago to Jewish-Russian immigrants. At the age of 15, he entered the law school of the University of Chicago.
During the late 1940s, Kutner built up his reputation as a human rights lawyer.
During his career he also gained the release of over 1,000 people, mainly as they were wrongfully convicted or being held without charge.

Kutner gained national recognition in 1949, when he obtained freedom for a black mechanic from Waukegan, Illinois, James Montgomery, who had served 26 years of a life term sentence for raping an itinerant. A Federal judge described as &quot;a sham&quot; the defendant&#x27;s 1924 trial in which a vengeful prosecutor withheld vital evidence. He also helped free Hungarian Cardinal József Mindszenty, American fascist poet Ezra Pound, former Congo President Moise Tshombe and represented the Dalai Lama and Tibet. Kutner is widely known as one of the most prominent human-rights attorneys of the twentieth century.

He is also accredited for the first acknowledged federal lawsuit against a prison warden by inmates in 1949. In 1952, Kutner filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Black passenger against Illinois Greyhound Lines, four years prior to the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle.

In 1966, Kutner participated in a lawsuit against George Lincoln Rockwell and the American Nazi Party.

== Intelligence service ==

Declassified records show that Kutner had a history of collusion with the FBI and the CIA. In 1969, he reported Fred Hampton to the FBI in the days leading to Hampton&#x27;s death at the hands of the Chicago Police. In 1973, he petitioned the CIA for $250k to set up an NGO in Beijing, in return letting the agency &quot;staff it completely with our own people.&quot;

== Author of living will ==
Luis Kutner was the first to publish the concept of the living will (which is the oldest form of an advance directive) in 1969. The term living will means that this form of will was to be used while an individual was still alive (but no longer able to make decisions). The term first occurs in the Luis Kutner Papers in a letter of November 15, 1967, in the context of Kutner’s correspondence with the Euthanasia Society of America. Kutner had first addressed the Euthanasia Society in August 1967 in connection with his plans to prepare an international symposium on Euthanasia (“Pro and Con”) which however was never materialized. On December 7, 1967, Kutner hold a speech on “Euthanasia and Due Process of Law” at the Euthanasia Society’s Annual Meeting in New York City. By that time, Kutner’s paper “Due Process of Euthanasia: The Living Will, A Proposal” was ready to be published, but publication was delayed until summer 1969 due to difficulties to find a publisher. In this paper, Kutner showed some sympathy with the propagators of “death on request” (active euthanasia), but stressed that a living will “authorizing mercy killing” would be “contrary to public policy”. Subsequently, Kutner published four more articles about the topic, in which he followed the same line of argumentation. For example, in 1987 he wrote in the University of Detroit Law Review: “The Living Will is a means for the individual to manage his death by protective guidelines and is premised on the informed consent of the person prior to an irreversible coma or a state of being disabled or maimed. It is based on the right of privacy – the individual’s right to self-determination of his body”. The Euthanasia Society of America adopted Kutner&#x27;s idea and devised a living will document which was distributed among members by the affiliate charity society Euthanasia Educational Fund (which became Euthanasia Educational Council in 1972 and Concern for Dying in 1978). Kutner probably never became a member of the Euthanasia Society of America or one of its successor organisations, and his later attempts to cooperate with them failed.

<text>BOI Block&quot;Italic text&quot;

The Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) or &quot;The Office of the Board of Investment&quot; is an agency of the Government of Thailand. Its mission is to promote foreign investment in Thailand by providing information, services, and incentives to interested foreign investors. The office operates under the of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The BOI operates 14 offices in major world cities as well as regional offices throughout Thailand. 

According to the Bank of Thailand (BOT) foreign direct investment (FDI) in Thailand in the first half of 2016 fell by more than 90 percent in value to US$347 million. The BOT said FDI declined from US$4.2 billion in the same period in 2015 to its lowest value since 2005.

==History and function==
The Office of the Board of Investment or “BOI” was established in 1966 in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Promotion Act. Their core mission is to promote investment by offering both tax-based and non-tax-based incentives. In addition, their mission also includes providing support to Thai investors looking to invest abroad.
For the last 50 years, the BOI has been the main public agency promoting business investment in Thailand, both domestically and internationally. Their objectives are to increase Thai competitiveness and to help Thailand avoid falling into the middle income trap, by helping to deliver balanced and sustainable economic growth in the country. 
A government organization under the Office of the Prime Minister is the Office of the Board of Investment. Its main roles and responsibilities are to promote direct investment. In accordance with the Investment Promotion Acts Nos. 2 B.E. 2534, No. 3 B.E. 2544, and No. 4 B.E. 2560, the Board of Investment establishes investment promotion policies. 

==Services scoring==
In general, overseas investors are satisfied with BOI services. The service with the highest satisfaction score is BOI incentives. The service with the lowest satisfaction score is the speed at which BOI provides its services. Foreign investors are satisfied with the integrity of BOI staff, but least satisfactory for foreign investors is responses and explanations from BOI staffers.

<doc id="551215" wikidata="Q380229" url="?curid=551215" title="Antony Beevor">
<text>Sir Antony James Beevor, (born 14 December 1946) is a British military historian. He has published several popular historical works, mainly on the Second World War, the Spanish Civil War, and most recently the Russian Revolution and Civil War.

Educated at Abberley Hall School, Winchester College, and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Beevor commanded a troop of tanks in the 11th Hussars in Germany before deciding in 1970 to leave the army and become a writer. He was a visiting professor at Birkbeck, University of London, and the University of Kent. His best-selling books, &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (1998) and &quot;&quot; (2002), have been acclaimed for their detailed coverage of the battles between the Soviet Union and Germany, and their focus on the experiences of ordinary people. &quot;Berlin&quot; proved very controversial in Russia because of the information it contained from former Soviet archives about the mass rapes carried out by the Red Army in 1945.

Beevor&#x27;s works have been translated into many languages and have sold millions of copies. He has lectured at numerous military headquarters, staff colleges and establishments in Britain, the US, Europe, and Australia. He has also written for many major newspapers.

==Early life and education==
Antony James Beevor was born in London on 14 December 1946. 

He was educated at two independent schools: Abberley Hall School in Worcestershire, and then Winchester College in Hampshire. He then went to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he studied under the military historian John Keegan, before receiving a commission in the 11th Hussars on 28 July 1967. 

Beevor served in England and Germany and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 January 1969 before resigning his commission on 5 August 1970.

==Career==
Beevor has been a visiting professor at the School of History, Classics and Archaeology at Birkbeck, University of London, and at the University of Kent. He was the 2002-2003 Lees-Knowles Lecturer at Cambridge University.

His best-known works, the best-selling &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (1998) and &quot;&quot; (2002), recount the World War II battles between the Soviet Union and Germany. They have been praised for their vivid, compelling style, their treatment of the ordinary lives of combatants and civilians, and the use of newly disclosed documents from Soviet archives. &quot;Berlin&quot; proved hugely controversial in Russia because of the information it contained from former Soviet archives about the mass rapes carried out by the Red Army in 1945. He was condemned for &quot;lies, slander and blasphemy&quot; against the Red Army by the Russian ambassador at the time, Grigory Karasin, and was frequently described as &quot;the chief slanderer of the Red Army&quot; by Kremlin-supporting media. 

His &quot;The Spanish Civil War&quot; (1982) was later re-written as &quot;The Battle for Spain&quot; (2006), keeping the structure and some content from the earlier work, but using the updated narrative style of his &quot;Stalingrad&quot; book and also adding characters and new archival research from German and Russian sources.

Beevor&#x27;s book &quot;The Second World War&quot; (2012) is notable for its focus on the conditions and grief faced by women and civilians and for its coverage of the war in East Asia, which has been called &quot;masterful&quot;. Beevor&#x27;s expertise has been the subject of some commentary; his publications have been praised as revitalizing interest in World War II topics and have allowed readers to reevaluate events such as from a new perspective. He has also appeared as an expert in television documentaries related to World War II.

, his works had been translated into 35 languages, with more than 8.5 million copies sold.

In August 2015, Russia&#x27;s Yekaterinburg region considered banning Beevor&#x27;s books, accusing him of Nazi sympathies, citing his lack of Russian sources when writing about Russia, and claiming he had promoted false stereotypes introduced by Nazi Germany during World War II. Beevor responded by calling the banning &quot;a government trying to impose its own version of history&quot;, comparing it to other &quot;attempts to dictate a truth&quot;, such as denial of the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide. 

In January 2018, Beevor&#x27;s book about the Battle of Stalingrad was criticised in Ukraine because of a single mistranslation in the Russian edition.

He has also written for &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, as well as &quot;El País&quot; and &quot;ABC&quot; in Spain. 

==Other activities==
Beevor, a former chair and member of the Council of the Society of Authors, resigned with Philip Pullman in 2022 in protest over the actions of the CEO and the leadership of the management committee.

==Personal life==
Beevor is descended from a long line of writers, starting with the legal philosopher John Austin and his wife Sarah, their daughter Lucie, Lady Duff Gordon (&quot;Letters from Egypt&quot;), his grandmother Lina Waterfield, (Observer correspondent and &quot;Castle in Italy&quot;), and his mother Kinta Beevor (&quot;A Tuscan Childhood&quot;). 

 he is married to biographer Artemis Cooper; they have two children.

==Honours and awards==
Beevor was recognised with the 2014 Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library&#x27;s Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing. Tim O&#x27;Brien, the 2013 recipient, made the announcement on behalf of the selection committee. The award carried a purse of US$100,000.

Beevor was awarded an Honorary D.Litt. from the University of Kent in 2004, from the University of Bath in 2010, the University of East Anglia in 2014, and the University of York in 2015. 

He was elected an honorary Fellow of King&#x27;s College London in July 2016. Also in July 2016, Beevor was awarded the Medlicott Medal for services to history by the UK-based Historical Association.

Beevor was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2017 New Year Honours for &quot;services in support of Armed Forces Professional Development&quot;.

He is also a Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, a member of Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana and a commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown.

<text>Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats or, in Ireland, slob or slobs, are coastal wetlands that form in intertidal areas where sediments have been deposited by tides or rivers. A global analysis published in 2019 suggested that tidal flat ecosystems are as extensive globally as mangroves, covering at least of the Earth&#x27;s surface. They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries; they are also seen in freshwater lakes and salty lakes (or inland seas) alike, wherein many rivers and creeks end. Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud, resulting from deposition of estuarine silts, clays and aquatic animal detritus. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.

A recent global remote sensing analysis estimated that approximately 50% of the global extent of tidal flats occurs within eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, United States, Canada, India, Brazil, and Myanmar) and that 44% of the world&#x27;s tidal flats occur within Asia (). A 2022 analysis of tidal wetland losses and gains estimates that global tidal flats experienced losses of between 1999 and 2019, which were largely offset by global gains of over the same time period.

In the past tidal flats were considered unhealthy, economically unimportant areas and were often dredged and developed into agricultural land. Some mudflats can be extremely treacherous to walk on. For example, the mudflats surrounding Anchorage, Alaska, are made from fine glacial-silt which does not easily separate out its water, and, although seemingly solid, can quickly gel and become like quicksand when disturbed by stepping on it. Four people are known to have become stuck up to their waists and drowned when the tide came in, and many others are rescued from the Anchorage mudflats each year. 

On the Baltic Sea coast of Germany in places, mudflats are exposed not by tidal action, but by wind-action driving water away from the shallows into the sea. This kind of wind-affected mudflat is called &quot;Windwatt&quot; in German.

==Ecology==
Tidal flats, along with intertidal salt marshes and mangrove forests, are important ecosystems. They usually support a large population of wildlife, and are a key habitat that allows tens of millions of migratory shorebirds to migrate from breeding sites in the northern hemisphere to non-breeding areas in the southern hemisphere. They are often of vital importance to migratory birds, as well as certain species of crabs, mollusks and fish. In the United Kingdom mudflats have been classified as a Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitat.

The maintenance of mudflats is important in preventing coastal erosion. However, mudflats worldwide are under threat from predicted sea level rises, land claims for development, dredging due to shipping purposes, and chemical pollution. In some parts of the world, such as East and South-East Asia, mudflats have been reclaimed for aquaculture, agriculture, and industrial development. For example, around the Yellow Sea region of East Asia, more than 65% of mudflats present in the early 1950s had been destroyed by the late 2000s. It is estimated that up to 16% of the world tidal flats have disappeared since the mid-1980s.

Mudflat sediment deposits are focused into the intertidal zone which is composed of a barren zone and marshes. Within these areas are various ratios of sand and mud that make up the sedimentary layers. The associated growth of coastal sediment deposits can be attributed to rates of subsidence along with rates of deposition (example: silt transported via river) and changes in sea level.
Barren zones extend from the lowest portion of the intertidal zone to the marsh areas. Beginning in close proximity to the tidal bars, sand dominated layers are prominent and become increasingly muddy throughout the tidal channels. Common bedding types include laminated sand, ripple bedding, and bay mud. Bioturbation also has a strong presence in barren zones.

Marshes contain an abundance of herbaceous plants while the sediment layers consist of thin sand and mud layers. Mudcracks are a common as well as wavy bedding planes. Marshes are also the origins of coal/peat layers because of the abundant decaying plant life.
Salt pans can be distinguished in that they contain thinly laminated layers of clayey silt. The main source of the silt comes from rivers. Dried up mud along with wind erosion forms silt dunes. When flooding, rain or tides come in, the dried sediment is then re-distributed.

<text>Harvey Kurtzman (; October 3, 1924 – February 21, 1993) was an American cartoonist and editor. His best-known work includes writing and editing the parodic comic book &quot;Mad&quot; from 1952 until 1956, and writing the &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; strips in &quot;Playboy&quot; from 1962 until 1988. His work is noted for its satire and parody of popular culture, social critique, and attention to detail. Kurtzman&#x27;s working method has been likened to that of an auteur, and he expected those who illustrated his stories to follow his layouts strictly.

Kurtzman began to work on the New Trend line of comic books at EC Comics in 1950. He wrote and edited the &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot; and &quot;Frontline Combat&quot; war comic books, where he also drew many of the carefully researched stories, before he created his most-remembered comic book, &quot;Mad&quot;, in 1952. Kurtzman scripted the stories and had them drawn by top EC cartoonists, most frequently Will Elder, Wally Wood, and Jack Davis; the early &quot;Mad&quot; was noted for its social critique and parodies of pop culture. The comic book switched to a magazine format in 1955, and Kurtzman left it in 1956 over a dispute with EC&#x27;s owner William Gaines over financial control. Following his departure, he did a variety of cartooning work, including editing the short-lived &quot;Trump&quot; and the self-published &quot;Humbug&quot;. In 1959, he produced the first book-length work of original comics, the adult-oriented, satirical &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. He edited the low-budget &quot;Help!&quot; from 1960 to 1965, a humor magazine which featured work by future Monty Python member and film director Terry Gilliam and the earliest work of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. He brought &quot;Help!&quot; to an end after the success of the risqué &quot;Playboy&quot; feature &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; began to take up his time. While &quot;Annie Fanny&quot; provided much of his income for the rest of his career, he continued to produce an eclectic body of work, including screenwriting the animated &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot; in 1967 and directing, writing and designing several shorts for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1969.

From 1973, Kurtzman taught cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York. His work gained greater recognition toward the end of his life, and he oversaw deluxe reprintings of much of his work. The Harvey Award was named in Kurtzman&#x27;s honor in 1988. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1989, and his work earned five positions on &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;s Top 100 Comics of the 20th Century.

==Personal and professional history==
===Early life (1924–1942)===
Harvey Kurtzman spoke little of his parents in interviews, and not much is known of their pre-American lives. David Kurtzman and Edith Sherman grew up in Ukraine in Odesa, and were literate urbanites. They belonged to the city&#x27;s large Jewish community, one that suffered generations of antisemitic oppression, and the city had fallen into economic hardship following the Russian Revolution. Shortly after World War I David emigrated to New York and Edith soon followed in what she called &quot;a desperate journey&quot; escaping the new Soviet Union. There the non-observant pair married in a civil ceremony. The first of their two sons, Zachary, was born April 8, 1923.

Harvey Kurtzman was born on October 3, 1924, in a tenement building on 428 East Ninety-Eighth Street in Brooklyn in New York City. David joined the Christian Science church, and when he suffered a bleeding ulcer he turned to prayer to cure it; he died from it on November 29, 1928, at age 36. The family was in such desperate financial straits that their mother placed the Kurtzman brothers in an orphanage for three months until she secured work as a milliner. Several months later, Edith remarried to Russian-Jewish immigrant Abraham Perkes, who worked in the printing industry as a brass engraver. The Kurtzman boys kept their surname, while their mother took that of Perkes. The couple had a son Daniel on February 17, 1931. In 1934, the family moved to the more upscale Bronx, where the family lived at 2166 Clinton Avenue.

Perkes was not wealthy, but managed to provide for his family during the Great Depression of the 1930s. He was a trade unionist, and the couple read the communist newspaper &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. Perkes brought young Kurtzman to work, and encouraged him to help with design and drawing and to think of himself as a professional artist.

Though he was a shy boy his teachers recognized Kurtzman&#x27;s intelligence in grade school and allowed him to skip a grade. He displayed artistic talent early and his sidewalk chalk drawings drew the attention of children and adults, who gathered around to watch him draw. He called these strips &quot;Ikey and Mikey&quot;, inspired by Goldberg&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Mike and Ike&quot;. His stepfather also had an interest in art and took the boys to museums. His mother encouraged his artistic development and enrolled him in art lessons; on Saturdays, he took the subway to Manhattan for formal art instruction. His parents had him attend the left-leaning Jewish Camp Kinderland, but he did not enjoy its dogmatic atmosphere. Though not ashamed of their Jewish heritage, neither of the Kurtzman brothers agreed to have a Bar Mitzvah.

Kurtzman fell in love with comic strips and the newly emerging comic books in the late 1930s. Unsatisfied with what he found in his parents&#x27; newspapers, he searched through garbage cans for the Sunday comics sections of his neighbors&#x27; newspapers. He admired a wide variety of strips, including Hamlin&#x27;s &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, Gould&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Foster&#x27;s &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, and Capp&#x27;s &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. He found Will Eisner&#x27;s comic book &quot;The Spirit&quot; a &quot;standard by which other comic books would be measured&quot;, and called Eisner &quot;&quot;the&quot; greatest ... a virtuoso cartoonist of a kind who had never been seen before&quot;. Eisner&#x27;s page layouts had considerable influence on Kurtzman&#x27;s work.

At 14 Kurtzman won a cartooning contest for which he received a dollar and had his cartoon published in &quot;Tip Top Comics&quot; 36 (April 1939). Future collaborator Jack Davis had won the same contest a few issues earlier. After winning the annual John Wanamaker Art Contest, Kurtzman received a scholarship to attend high school at The High School of Music &amp; Art. Future colleagues Will Elder, Al Feldstein, Al Jaffee, John Severin, and Charles Stern also attended the school. His ambitions were apparent even then; at a 2016 New York Comic Con panel, Jaffee recounted how a 15-year-old Kurtzman told his fellow students Jaffee and Elder &quot;Someday I&#x27;m going to have a magazine, and I&#x27;m going to hire you guys.&quot; Kurtzman graduated at 16 in 1941 and went on to Cooper Union on a scholarship. Kurtzman left after a year to focus on making comic books.

===Early career (1942–1949)===
Kurtzman met Alfred Andriola in 1942, encouraged by a quote in Martin Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;Classic Comics and their Creators&quot; where Andriola offered help to aspiring cartoonists. Kurtzman made an appointment, but Andriola&#x27;s response to his work was discouraging—he told Kurtzman to give up on cartooning. Kurtzman called this meeting &quot;one of the worst days of life&quot;, though he ignored Andriola&#x27;s advice and continued to peddle his portfolio.

Kurtzman continued to do odd jobs in 1942 until he got his first break in the comics industry at Louis Ferstadt&#x27;s studio, which produced comics for Quality, Ace, Gilberton, and the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. His first published work there was assisting on issue #5 (September 1942) of Gilberton&#x27;s &quot;Classic Comics&quot;, which features an adaptation of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. His first pencil job appeared in &quot;Four Favorites&quot; #8 (December 1942). He produced a large amount of undistinguished work in 1942 and 1943, which he later called &quot;very crude, very ugly stuff&quot;, before he was drafted in 1943 for service in World War II.

Kurtzman trained for the infantry, but was never sent overseas. He was stationed in Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. He illustrated instruction manuals, posters, and flyers, and contributed cartoons to camp newspapers, and newsletters. While there, he was invited by publisher and cartoonist L. B. Cole to draw the &quot;Black Venus&quot; superheroine, packaged for publisher Rae Herman&#x27;s Orbit Publications. In 1944, he did work for several local publications while stationed in North Carolina, and had several gag cartoons in &quot;Yank&quot; by the end of October 1945. The quantity of work allowed Kurtzman to hone his style, which became more refined and distinct.

After his discharge following the war, Kurtzman found competition fierce in the comics industry, as freelancing replaced the system of packaging shops. He applied to the newspaper &quot;PM&quot;, but his portfolio was rejected by cartoon editor Walt Kelly. After a series of short-lived assignments and partnerships, Kurtzman got together with former Music and Art alumni Will Elder and Charles Stern. They opened Charles William Harvey Studio in 1947, but had difficulty getting work. The three had little business sense. Kurtzman managed the bills. In their Broadway studio, which Kurtzman kept open until the end of 1951, they sublet space to cartoonists such as John Severin, Dave Berg, and René Goscinny.

Kurtzman had been doing crossword puzzles for publisher Martin Goodman since early in his career. A distant relative of Goodman&#x27;s, Stan Lee, worked as an editor for Goodman&#x27;s Timely Comics (a precursor to Marvel Comics). He offered Kurtzman work doing one-page fillers, work that paid little. Lee named the strip &quot;Hey Look!&quot;, and Kurtzman produced 150 episodes of it from 1946 until 1949.

At a Music and Art reunion in early 1946 Kurtzman met Adele Hasan, who was one of the staff members at Timely and was dating Will Elder. She fell for Kurtzman, confiding to Al Jaffee that he &quot;was the kind of kind like to marry&quot;. Later in the year, Timely ran a &quot;Now You Can Be the Editor!&quot; contest whose ballots Hasan was assigned to sort through. She was disappointed that readers did not enjoy Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Hey Look!&quot; as much as she did. She &quot;stuffed the ballot box&quot; in Kurtzman&#x27;s favor, which prompted an astonished Stan Lee to assign Kurtzman more work. Kurtzman was given the talking animal feature &quot;Pigtales&quot; at regular freelance rates, as well as miscellaneous other assignments. As Harvey stopped by the Timely offices more frequently, he and Adele would flirt, and eventually started dating. She left Timely for college that autumn, and corresponded frequently with Kurtzman; soon she dropped out of college and the two married that September.

In 1948 Kurtzman produced a Sunday comic strip, &quot;Silver Linings&quot;, which ran infrequently in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; between March and June. Lee had &quot;Hey Look!&quot; brought to an end in 1949 so Kurtzman could concentrate on longer features for Timely&#x27;s family-oriented line. Kurtzman was assigned artwork duties for the Lee-scripted &quot;Rusty&quot;, an imitation of Chic Young&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;, but was disappointed with this type of work and began looking for other employment. He sold episodes of the one-pagers &quot;Egghead Doodle&quot; and &quot;Genius&quot; to Timely and Al Capp&#x27;s Toby Press on a freelance basis. He also sold longer pieces to Toby, including episodes of his Western parody &quot;Pot Shot Pete&quot;, a short-lived series that hinted at the pop-culture satire Kurtzman was to become known for.

Kurtzman came across Charles Biro&#x27;s &quot;Crime Does Not Pay&quot;, a comic book Kurtzman describes as reading with &quot;the same excitement ... that felt about the underground comic books of twenty years later&quot;. These stories presented a view of reality quite different from the escapist entertainment typical of comics of the day, and was to influence the war and social drama work Kurtzman was soon to do at EC Comics.

===EC and &quot;Mad&quot; (1949–1956)===
Kurtzman continued to shop his work around, and produced work for Ace/Periodical, Quality, Aviation Press, Timely, and the magazines &quot;Varsity&quot; and &quot;Parents&quot;. He did a number of children&#x27;s books, four of which were collaborations with René Goscinny. He brought some samples of educational comics into the EC Comics offices—&quot;EC&quot; had originally stood for &quot;Educational Comics&quot; when it was run by Max Gaines, but his son Bill changed the company&#x27;s focus and name to &quot;Entertaining Comics&quot; when he inherited the business. Gaines liked Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Hey Look!&quot; samples but had no immediate use for his particular skills. Gaines directed Kurtzman to his brother, David, who gave him some low-paying work on &quot;Lucky Fights it Through&quot;, a two-fisted cowboy story with an educational health message about syphilis.

With the doors to EC open to him Kurtzman started getting regular work from the publisher in 1950. That spring, EC&#x27;s &quot;New Trend&quot; line of horror, fantasy, and science fiction comics began, and Kurtzman contributed stories in these genres. His income doubled over the previous year&#x27;s. In late 1950, he began writing and editing an adventure title, &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;, which he proposed as a comic book in the vein of Roy Crane&#x27;s popular comic strip, &quot;Captain Easy&quot;. The comic book differed in offering realistic stories in place of Crane&#x27;s idealism, a degree of realism not yet seen in American comics. The war stories of &quot;Frontline Combat&quot; followed in mid-1951. The stories were not only about modern war, but also derived from deep in history, such as the Roman legions and Napoleonic campaigns. Kurtzman rejected the idealization of war that had swept the US since World War II. He spent hours in the New York Public Library in search of the detailed truth behind the stories he was writing, sometimes taking days or weeks to research a story. His research included interviewing and corresponding with GIs taking a ride aboard a rescue plane, and sending his assistant Jerry DeFuccio for a ride in a submarine to gather sound effects. (DeFuccio&#x27;s first field report from this assignment was a 10-word telegram to Kurtzman reading &quot;MANY BRAVE HEARTS ARE ASLEEP IN THE DEEP GLUB GLUB.&quot;) The stories gave a sympathetic look to both sides of a conflict, regardless of nationality or ethnicity. He sought to tell what he saw as the objective truth about war, deglamorizing it and showing its futility, though the stories were not explicitly anti-war.

Kurtzman was given a great deal of artistic freedom by Gaines, but was himself a strict taskmaster. He insisted that the artists who drew his stories not deviate from his layouts. The artists generally respected Kurtzman&#x27;s wishes out of respect for his creative authority, but some, like Bernie Krigstein and Dan Barry, felt their own artistic autonomy impinged upon.

Those who worked for EC received payment based on output. Kurtzman&#x27;s laborious working methods meant he was less prolific than fellow EC writer and editor Al Feldstein, and Kurtzman felt financially underappreciated for the amount of effort he poured into his work. He was financially burdened with a mortgage and a family. He also detested the horror content of the books Feldstein was producing, and which consistently outsold his own work. He believed these stories had the same sort of influence on children that the chauvinism of war comics which he believed he worked hard against in his own work. Remembering Kurtzman&#x27;s humor work from the 1940s, Gaines proposed a humor magazine to increase Kurtzman&#x27;s income, as he believed it would take far less time and effort to research. &quot;Mad&quot; debuted in August 1952, and Kurtzman scripted every story in the first twenty-three issues. The stories in &quot;Mad&quot; targeted what Kurtzman saw as fundamental untruths in the subjects parodied, inspired by the irreverent humor found in college humor magazines. They were developed in the same incremental way Kurtzman had developed for the war stories, and his layouts were followed faithfully by the artists who drew them—most frequently, Will Elder, Jack Davis and Wally Wood.

&quot;Mad&quot; did not have instant success, but found its audience by the fourth issue, which quickly sold out. The issue featured the Wood-drawn &quot;Superduperman&quot;, a parody of Superman and Captain Marvel, including the copyright infringement lawsuit that National Periodicals (now DC Comics) had recently brought against Fawcett Comics. National, the owners of Superman&#x27;s copyright, threatened to file another lawsuit over the parody. EC and National shared the same lawyer, who advised Gaines to quit publishing parodies. While Gaines was weighing this advice, Kurtzman discovered a legal precedent that backed &quot;Mad&quot;″s right to parody. Gaines hired the author of that precedent to write a brief substantiating EC&#x27;s position, but the lawyer sided with National. Gaines consulted a third lawyer, who advised Gaines to ignore the threat and continue publishing parodies. National never filed suit. When Kurtzman parodied National&#x27;s Batman character just four issues later, the spoof included six separate picket signs, posters and other notices proclaiming that &quot;Batboy and Rubin&quot; was a comedic imitation, e.g.: &quot;Not a spittoon, not a cartoon, not a harpoon, but a LAMPOON!&quot;

Parodying specific targets became a staple of &quot;Mad&quot;. Beginning April 1954, the bimonthly &quot;Mad&quot; went monthly after the cancelation of &quot;Frontline Combat&quot;, whose sales had flagged when the Korean War ended. Soon, large numbers of &quot;Mad&quot; imitators sprang up from other publishers, as well as from EC itself with the Feldstein-edited &quot;Panic&quot;. Kurtzman poured himself into &quot;Mad&quot;, putting as much effort into it as he had into his war books. This defeated the purpose of having an easy-to-produce third book, but with &quot;Frontline Combat&quot;s cancelation, Kurtzman focused on &quot;Mad&quot;.

During the early 1950s, Kurtzman became one of the writers for Dan Barry&#x27;s relaunched &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; daily comic strip. He scripted two sequences for the strip, with portions pencilled by Frank Frazetta. The strip soon became one of &quot;Mad&quot;″s targets in &quot;Flesh Garden!&quot;, drawn by Wood, who had earlier assisted Barry on the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip. In 1954, Kurtzman dreamed up a full-color, 100-page adaptation of Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; called &quot;Marley&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, and proposed the project to Simon &amp; Schuster and other publishers. The proposal included seven finished pages, as well as a page redone by Jack Davis in case publishers&#x27; rejections were due to Kurtzman&#x27;s drawing style. The ambitious project did not find a willing publisher, as comics were still seen as too low-brow for such lavish treatment.

Since the 1940s, crime and horror comics had been drawing fire from those worried about a rise in juvenile delinquency. The Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency brought pressure on such comic books in 1954, and EC, one of the major purveyors of such fare, found their wares being refused by their distributor. Gaines brought those titles to an end and tried to replace them with the New Direction line, but by autumn 1955 the only remaining EC title was &quot;Mad&quot;. Gaines had just allowed Kurtzman to change &quot;Mad&quot;″s format to a magazine in July, in order to keep him at EC after Kurtzman had received an offer of employment from &quot;Pageant&quot; magazine.

Kurtzman had long dreamed of joining the slick magazine publishing world, and had been trying to convince Gaines to publish &quot;Mad&quot; in a larger, more adult format. The August issue of &quot;Pageant&quot; featured an article &quot;Now Comics Have Gone &quot;Mad&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Pageant&quot;″s publisher Alex Hillman offered Kurtzman a job. With the prospect of losing his lone editor and writer, Gaines gave in to Kurtzman&#x27;s demands. The magazine-format twenty-fourth issue of &quot;Mad&quot; (July 1955) was more successful than anticipated, and had to be reprinted, an unusual occurrence in magazine publishing. The new presentation was ambitious, and included meticulously rendered advertisement parodies and text pieces by humorists such as Ernie Kovacs, Stan Freberg, and Steve Allen. It was around this time that Kurtzman introduced &quot;Mad&quot;″s gap-toothed mascot and his slogan, &quot;What, me worry?&quot;, whom Feldstein later named Alfred E. Neuman.

Elsewhere, the one-time cartoonist Hugh Hefner had become a media mogul by the mid-1950s with his &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. He had admired Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot;, and met Kurtzman in New York to express his appreciation. He told Kurtzman that if he were ever to leave &quot;Mad&quot;, a place would be waiting for him in the Hefner empire. With this promise to back him, Kurtzman demanded legal control of &quot;Mad&quot; from Gaines in the form of stocks. Reluctant to lose the editor of his sole remaining publication, Gaines offered a 10% share. As this would not give Kurtzman the control he wanted, Kurtzman countered with a demand for 51%. Gaines refused, and the two parted ways. Kurtzman contacted Hefner and Gaines hired Al Feldstein to edit &quot;Mad&quot;.

===&quot;Trump&quot;, &quot;Humbug&quot; and &quot;Jungle Book&quot; (1957–1959)===


Hefner employed Kurtzman from April 1956. The slick, full-color &quot;Trump&quot; appeared on newsstands in January 1957. Cartoonists who contributed to &quot;Trump&quot; included &quot;Mad&quot; regulars such as Elder, Wood, Davis, and Jaffee, as well as Russ Heath and newer artists such as Irving Geis, Arnold Roth, and R. O. Blechman. Writers Mel Brooks, Roger Price, Doodles Weaver, and Max Shulman also made contributions. The fifty-cent magazine was a luxurious, more risqué version of &quot;Mad&quot;, and sold well. Unfortunately, Hefner began to have financial problems, and canceled &quot;Trump&quot; after its second issue. The magazine had been a success in the market, but had already accrued $100,000 in expenses, about which Hefner quipped, &quot;I gave Harvey Kurtzman an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.&quot;

Hefner delivered the news in person to Kurtzman—in the hospital where his third child, Elizabeth, was being born. Adele said it was the only time she had seen her husband cry. Kurtzman later said that &quot;Trump&quot; was the closest he ever came to producing &quot;the perfect humor magazine&quot;.

While the &quot;Trump&quot; artists were mulling over the situation in the &quot;Playboy&quot; offices, Roth approached with a bottle of scotch. By the time they left the office, the group had agreed to embark on a publishing venture of their own: &quot;Humbug&quot;. The publication was financed and run by the artists who created it, though none of the group had business experience. Only artist Jack Davis became an equal shareholder and the only salaried employee despite declining to financially back the project; his participation was considered vital to its success. The others would joke in years to come that Davis was the only one to make any money from &quot;Humbug&quot;.

With Kurtzman in the lead the reinvigorated, close-knit group set out to produce a classy publication in the vein of college humor magazines, but aimed at a general readership. Along with the pop-cultural satire that had been the staple of &quot;Mad&quot; and &quot;Trump&quot;, &quot;Humbug&quot; included more topical and political satire, mostly from writers other than Kurtzman. Hefner provided the group desirable office space at an inexpensive rate, out of guilt for canceling &quot;Trump&quot; so quickly.

&quot;Humbug&quot; ran into snags right away due to its small format, which made it difficult for consumers to find it on the newsstands. It also suffered distribution problems. For its last two issues, &quot;Humbug&quot; was printed in a standard magazine size, and the price was raised from fifteen cents to twenty-five. At the last minute, the page count of the eleventh issue was increased from thirty-two pages to forty-eight, reprinting material from &quot;Trump&quot;. This last issue included a self-deprecating message from Kurtzman which summarized the artists&#x27; careers and announced &quot;Humbug&quot;″s farewell. The group followed divergent career paths following the breakup.

After the demise of &quot;Humbug&quot;, Kurtzman spent a few years as a freelance contributor to magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Madison Avenue&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, and &quot;Pageant&quot;. With Elliot Caplin he produced a poorly received comic strip, &quot;Kermit the Hermit&quot;, among other miscellaneous work. In 1958 Kurtzman proposed a strip to &quot;TV Guide&quot; parodying adult Western TV shows; its rejection particularly disappointed him.

In 1959, Ballantine Books was looking for something to replace its successful line of &quot;Mad&quot; mass-market paperback reprints after Gaines had taken it to another publisher. Ballantine had earlier published &quot;The Humbug Digest&quot; in the same format, though it fared poorly in the market. Kurtzman proposed a book of original material designed for the format, which Ian Ballantine, with reservations, accepted on faith out of respect for Kurtzman. &quot;Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s Jungle Book&quot; was the first mass-market paperback of original comics content in the United States, and to Kurtzman biographer Denis Kitchen was a precursor to the graphic novel. Whereas his &quot;Mad&quot; stories had been aimed at an adolescent audience, Kurtzman made &quot;Jungle Book&quot; for adults, which was unusual in American comics. &quot;Jungle Book&quot; sold poorly, but remained a favorite among its small number of devoted fans. If it had been a success, Kurtzman intended to continue with more books in the same vein.

===&quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; (1960–1965)===
Kurtzman had &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ant&quot; printed in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 1960. The strip was a social allegory of a hipster grasshopper and a hard-working ant with opposing worldviews, both of whom lose out in the end. It was a rarity for Kurtzman in that he created it in full color, rather in black-and-white lineart with color added afterward. Kurtzman once more proposed &quot;Marley&#x27;s Ghost&quot; to a number of publishers in 1962, including &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, but again it was rejected.

In 1960, Harvey teamed up with publisher James Warren to co-publish &quot;Help!&quot;. Warren Publishing ran the business end, while co-ownership of the magazine allowed Kurtzman the control that he wanted, though its tight budget restricted that control. The magazine made frequent use of &quot;fumetti&quot; photographic comics, which sometimes starred celebrities such as Woody Allen and a pre-Monty Python John Cleese. The first issue was cover-dated August 1960. Gloria Steinem and Terry Gilliam were among those the magazine employed. By the end of its run, &quot;Help!&quot; had introduced a number of young cartoonists who were to play a major part in the movement, including Robert Crumb, Jay Lynch, Gilbert Shelton, Spain Rodriguez, and Skip Williamson.

&quot;Help!&quot;″s most famous story starred Kurtzman&#x27;s character Goodman Beaver in &quot;Goodman Goes &quot;Playboy&quot;&quot; in the February 1962 issue. The story satirized Hefner and his lifestyle, while parodying &quot;Archie&quot; comics in a much more risqué way than the previous &quot;Starchie&quot; parody in &quot;Mad&quot; had. The &quot;Archie&quot; characters were drinking, partying skirt-chasers home from college. &quot;Archie&quot;″s publishers sued, and Warren agreed to settle out of court rather than risk an expensive lawsuit. The actual target of the strip had however been Hefner, who loved it; Kurtzman began working for Hefner again soon after.

Kurtzman approached Hefner in 1960 with the idea of a comic strip feature for &quot;Playboy&quot; that would star Goodman Beaver. &quot;Playboy&quot; ran a lot of cartoons, but a comic strip was something new to the magazine. After discussing ideas, Kurtzman&#x27;s proposal was accepted under the condition that Goodman Beaver be transformed into a voluptuous female. &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; was &quot;Playboy&quot; first comic strip and the first multi-page comics feature in an American slick magazine. As his primary collaborator, Kurtzman had Will Elder provide the strip&#x27;s labor-intensive, fully painted full-color final rendering. &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; began appearing in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1962.

Kurtzman and Warren disagreed on Kurtzman&#x27;s editorial decisions on &quot;Help!&quot;, and Kurtzman found himself unsatisfied with the partnership. &quot;Help!&quot;″s sales were declining, and the magazine quietly came to an end with its twenty-sixth issue, cover-dated September 1965. This allowed Kurtzman and Elder to focus full-time on &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot;. Hefner was a demanding editor and delivered critiques to Kurtzman that could reach twenty pages.

===Later years (1965–1993)===
Kurtzman participated in a number of film projects beginning in the late 1960s. He co-scripted the stop-motion animated film &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot; (1967), a job he got through the recommendation of Jack Davis, who had been doing character designs for the film&#x27;s production company Rankin/Bass. Kurtzman wrote, co-directed, and designed several short animated pieces for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1969; he was particularly proud of the Phil Kimmelman-animated &quot;Boat&quot;, in which a left prosthetic-legged sea captain voiced by Hal Smith orders a series of increasingly larger numerals to load into a boat, eventually sinking it. In 1972, he appeared in a television advertisement for Scripto pens.

Kurtzman turned down a number of well-paying opportunities in the 1970s. In early 1972, Stan Lee offered Kurtzman a senior position at Marvel Comics, and proposed another &quot;Mad&quot;-like magazine; Kurtzman turned these opportunities down, as he felt unprepared to return to the comic book industry after being out of it for so long since leaving EC. Marvel launched &quot;Crazy Magazine&quot; without him in 1973. Michael C. Gross asked him to contribute to &quot;National Lampoon&quot; around this time. The magazine&#x27;s staff revered Kurtzman and had published a parody of &quot;Mad&quot; in 1971 that included &quot;Citizen Gaines&quot;, a piece critical of Gaines&#x27; handling of &quot;Mad&quot; and treatment of Kurtzman. Kurtzman turned the offer down, as he felt out of step with the younger cartoonists&#x27; approach. He turned down an offer from René Goscinny in 1973 to act as the US agent for the French comics magazine&quot; Pilote&quot;.

In 1973, New York&#x27;s School of Visual Arts asked Kurtzman and Will Eisner to take teaching positions there in cartooning. Kurtzman had no earlier teaching experience and found the prospect daunting, but Eisner convinced him to take the job. Eisner&#x27;s class was called &quot;Sequential Art&quot; and Kurtzman&#x27;s was &quot;Satirical Cartooning&quot;, which focused on single-panel gag cartooning. Kurtzman had a soft touch with his students, and was well respected and well liked. He frequently had professional cartoonists appear as guest lecturers. When the school refused to publish his students&#x27; work, Kurtzman had them published in an ad-supported, student-produced anthology that came to be called &quot;Kar-Tünz&quot;. &quot;Kar-Tünz&quot; ran for fifteen years.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Kurtzman&#x27;s stature began to grow. His protégés such as Crumb, Spiegelman and Gilliam sang his praises, his reputation grew with the spread of comics fandom, and collector Glenn Bray published &quot;The Illustrated Harvey Kurtzman Index&quot; in 1976. He also found he had a following in Europe; his work appeared there for the first time in the French magazine &quot;Charlie Mensuel&quot; in October 1970, and in 1973 the European Academy of Comic Book Art awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award for 1972. A series of reprint projects and one-shot efforts appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Kurtzman Komix&quot;, published in 1976 by Kitchen Sink Press. In his later years, Kurtzman continued to work on anthologies and various other projects, including editing two volumes of a YA original anthology series, &quot;Nuts&quot;, packaged by Byron Preiss and published by Bantam Books in 1985. He oversaw reprints of his work in deluxe editions from Russ Cochran, who did &quot;The Complete EC Library&quot;, and Kitchen Sink Press, who did collections of &quot;Goodman Beaver&quot; (1984), &quot;Hey Look!&quot; (1992), and others, and reprinted &quot;Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s Jungle Book&quot; (1988). Lengthy interviews were conducted with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; and &quot;Squa Tront&quot;. The comics industry&#x27;s Harvey Award was named in his honor in 1988. Kurtzman toured and gave speeches frequently to fans in the 1980s.

Kurtzman had reconciled with Gaines by the mid-1980s, and in collaboration with Elder, illustrated 19 pieces and covers for &quot;Mad&quot; from 1986 to 1989. Kurtzman brought &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; to an end in 1988, amid failing health, a poor relationship with &quot;Playboy&quot; cartoon editor Michelle Urry, and resentment over the discovery that he did not own the rights to the strip. &quot;Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s Strange Adventures&quot; assembled a wide cast of cartoonists in 1990 to illustrate stories from Kurtzman&#x27;s layouts, though the book was not a success, nor was a revival of &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;. He had long planned to write a comics history, but other work had taken priority. Towards the end of his life, he agreed to collaborate with comics historian Michael Barrier to complete &quot;From Aargh! to Zap! Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s Visual History of the Comics&quot;, which was published in 1991, though it was shorter than the more complete history Kurtzman had planned.

Kurtzman, who had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and colon cancer in later life, died at Mount Vernon, New York on February 21, 1993, of complications from liver cancer, nine months after Bill Gaines&#x27; death. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commissioned a commemorative cartoon by Will Elder and ran an elegy by writer Adam Gopnik. Cartoonist Jules Feiffer remarked at the time that cartooning had lost its Orson Welles.

==Personal life==
Kurtzman stood and was of slight build. He had an unassuming demeanor; humorist Roger Price likened him to &quot;a beagle who is too polite to mention that someone is standing on his tail&quot;. Rolf Malcolm described him as someone who smiles little and speaks slowly. Al Jaffee said he &quot;was not an easy person to get too close to&quot;.

Kurtzman and wife Adele (née Hasan) were married in September 1948. They had three daughters and one son: Meredith, born July 28, 1950; Peter, born June 29, 1954; Elizabeth, born January 21, 1957; and Cornelia &quot;Nellie&quot;, born April 15, 1969. (Meredith in 1970 went on to become one of the contributors to &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot;, the first comic book produced entirely by women.)

Kurtzman&#x27;s work allowed him to be at home with his children during the day, and he gave them much of his attention. As Peter had low-functioning autism, the Kurtzmans volunteered locally for work with special needs children, and in 1986 began an annual charity auction, raising money by selling the artwork of cartoonists for the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester, which Adele continued to oversee following her husband&#x27;s death.

==Style and working method==
According to Kurtzman, &quot;Cartooning consists of the two elements, graphics and texts  ... Obviously it is to the advantage of the total product to have good text and good art and the more closely integrated the good text and good art are, the greater the opportunity is to create the capital-A Art.&quot; The stories he created and had others illustrate balance captions and dialogue, in contrast with, for example, Al Feldstein&#x27;s EC stories, in which the artists had to compensate for the text which dominated the page.

In the war stories he drew himself he employed a drawing style that distorted figures in expressive ways more akin to modern art than the stylizations of contemporary superhero or talking animal comics. R. C. Harvey described this style as &quot;abstract and telepathic&quot; in stories that were realistic in the telling, but in which &quot;his figures were exaggerated and contorted, demonstrations of posture as drama rather than reality as perceived&quot;. French comics historian Jacques Dutrey described Kurtzman&#x27;s style as &quot;movement and shapes, energy and aesthetics&quot;.

Many liken Kurtzman&#x27;s working method to that of an auteur. In developing stories in this way Kurtzman aimed to reach a balance between text and graphics. He developed a way of creating stories incrementally, beginning with a paragraph-long treatment of the story. After deciding on a story and an ending which had impact, he laid out thumbnail sketches in miniature, with captions and dialogue. He proceeded to revise repeatedly on tracing paper, tacking one layer on top of another, as he worked out &quot;what characters have to say&quot;. He prepared layouts on large pieces of vellum to pass on to the artists, with supplemental photographs and drawings, and personally led the artist through the story before the finished artwork was begun. According to Jack Davis, &quot;When you&#x27;d pick up a story, Harvey would sit down with you and he ... acted it out, all the way through ... You felt like you&#x27;d lived the story.&quot;

Typically when working on &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot;, after researching the background story, Kurtzman prepared a penciled layout on Bristol board a color guide for Elder on an vellum overlay. He would then create a larger version of the page on vellum with a image area, which he would create using colored markers, working his way up from lighter to darker colors as he tightened the composition. He then traced this onto another sheet of vellum, or more if still unsatisfied with the results. He would pass this on to Elder to render the final image following Kurtman&#x27;s layouts exactly after having the image transferred to illustration board.

Kurtzman&#x27;s layouts owed considerable debt to Will Eisner&#x27;s work on &quot;The Spirit&quot;. He derived a chiaroscuro technique from Milt Caniff in his 1940s studio work.

==Legacy==
Along with cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, and Carl Barks, Kurtzman is regularly cited as one of the defining creators of the Golden Age of American comic books. In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Kurtzman as &quot;one of the most important figures in postwar America&quot; over &quot;Mad&quot;″s influence on popular culture. This was an upgrade from the &quot;Times&quot;″ obituary for Kurtzman in 1993, which said he had &quot;helped found &quot;Mad&quot; Magazine.&quot; This prompted an angry response to the newspaper from Art Spiegelman, who complained that awarding Kurtzman partial credit for starting &quot;Mad&quot; was &quot;like saying Michelangelo helped paint the Sistine Chapel just because some Pope owned the ceiling.&quot;

Kurtzman acted as mentor to a large number of cartoonists, such as Terry Gilliam, Robert Crumb, and Gilbert Shelton. Students of his at the School of Visual Arts included John Holmstrom, Batton Lash, and Drew Friedman. Kurtzman, and particularly his work on &quot;Mad&quot;, is the most frequently cited influence on the movement—comics historian Mark Estren called &quot;Mad&quot; &quot;the granddaddy of the underground &quot;. In 1958, Robert Crumb and his older brother Charles self-published three issues of the &quot;Humbug&quot;-inspired fanzine &quot;Foo&quot; in 1958. The venture was not a financial success, and Crumb turned to producing comics to satisfy himself. In 1964 Kurtzman published his work in &quot;Help!&quot;.

Kurtzman&#x27;s style of humor influenced countercultural comedians from the 1960s on, including the sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, according to member Harry Shearer. &quot;Help!&quot; contributor Terry Gilliam, who went on to be a member of Monty Python, called Kurtzman &quot;n many ways ... one of the godparents of Monty Python&quot;. In his 1985 film &quot;Brazil&quot;, Terry Gilliam gave Ian Holm&#x27;s character the name &quot;Kurtzmann&quot;. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb asserted that one of Kurtzman&#x27;s cover images for &quot;Humbug&quot; &quot;changed [his] life&quot; and that another &quot;Mad&quot; cover image &quot;changed the way [he] saw the world forever!&quot; On Kurtzman&#x27;s influence &quot;Time&quot; editor Richard Corliss stated, &quot;Almost all American satire today follows a formula that Harvey Kurtzman thought up.&quot;

While some, such as R. C. Harvey considered it a masterpiece, others such as Michael Dooley felt &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; was &quot;known more for its lavish production values than its humor&quot;, or that it compromised Kurtzman&#x27;s genius. A minority of underground cartoonists considered him a sell out for compromising his ideals by working for &quot;Playboy&quot; for twenty-six years. Many fans consider &quot;Help!&quot; to be Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;last hurrah&quot;.

The Kirby Awards came to an end in 1987, and the Harvey Awards and Eisner Awards took its place. Named in Kurtzman&#x27;s honor, the Harveys are administered by Fantagraphics Books, and nominees and winners are selected by comics professionals. Kurtzman was one of seven cartoonists featured in the traveling &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot; exhibition in 2005–2006.

To &quot;Comics Journal&quot; editor and Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, Kurtzman&#x27;s style &quot;achieves some sort of Platonic ideal of cartooning. Harvey was a master of composition, tone and visual rhythm, both within the panel and among the panels comprising the page. He was also able to convey fragments of genuine humanity through an impressionistic technique that was fluid and supple.&quot; Comics critic and historian R. C. Harvey conjectured that Kurtzman &quot;may be the most influential American cartoonist since Walt Disney&quot;, and comics historian Don Markstein considered him &quot;among the most influential cartoonists of the 20th century&quot;. In its list of 100 best English-language comics of the 20th century, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; awarded Kurtzman five of the slots:

In 2012, Kurtzman&#x27;s estate and Al Feldstein filed to reclaim the copyrights on their 1950s work at EC. The claim was based on changes to copyright laws made in 1976, in which copyrights sold could be reclaimed by the original independent creators at the time of copyright renewal. The basis of the Kurtzman and Feldstein claims was that they were not employees of EC, but subcontractors.

Comics collector Glenn Bray published &quot;The Illustrated Harvey Kurtzman Index&quot; in 1976, a complete guide to everything Kurtzman had published to that point. Howard Zimmerman adapted interviews with Kurtzman conducted by Zimmerman and Byron Preiss into a short autobiography in 1988 titled &quot;Harvey Kurtzman: My Life as a Cartoonist&quot;. Denis Kitchen and Paul Buhle produced a biography of Kurtzman in 2009 titled &quot;The Art of Harvey Kurtzman: The Mad Genius of Comics&quot;, with an introduction by comedian Harry Shearer. Bill Schelly spent three years to research and write another, longer one in 2015, titled &quot;Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created MAD and Revolutionized Humor in America&quot;, with an introduction by Terry Gilliam.

In 2014, Dark Horse Comics via their Kitchen Sink Books imprint began reprinting deluxe, expanded editions of Kurtzman work in &quot;The Essential Kurtzman&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Harvey Kurtzman’s Jungle Book,&quot; edited and designed by John Lind and including new essays on the work from Lind, Denis Kitchen, R.Crumb, Peter Poplaski, and an introduction by Gilbert Shelton. The work received two nominations (Best Reprint and Excellence in Publication) in the 2015 Harvey Awards. The second volume in the series &quot;Playboy&quot;’s &quot;TRUMP&quot;, a collection of the 1950s satire magazine created by Kurtzman and Hugh Hefner, was published in 2016.

<text>Thomas Eugene Kurtz (February 22, 1928 – November 12, 2024) was an American computer scientist and educator. A Dartmouth professor of mathematics, he and colleague John G. Kemeny are best known for co-developing the BASIC programming language and the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System in 1963 and 1964. These innovations made computing more accessible by simplifying programming for non-experts and allowing multiple users to share a single computer, transforming how computers were used in education and research.

For his role in creating BASIC, the IEEE honored Kurtz in 1991 with the Computer Pioneer Award, and in 1994, he was inducted as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Kurtz was born on February 22, 1928, in Oak Park, Illinois, United States, to Helen Bell Kurtz and Oscar Christ Kurtz. His father, a German-American, worked for the Lions Clubs International headquarters, holding various roles. From an early age, Kurtz developed an interest in science.

Kurtz enrolled at Knox College and developed an interest in mathematics, eventually taking every offered course in the subject. Encouraged by his advisor to pursue a career in statistics, he switched his major to mathematics during his senior year. Kurtz graduated from Knox College in 1950 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics.

His first experience with computing came in 1951 at the Summer Session of the Institute for Numerical Analysis at University of California, Los Angeles. Kurtz went on to acquire his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1956. His thesis was on a problem of multiple comparisons in mathematical statistics, and his advisor was John Tukey. Kurtz&#x27;s mathematical interests included numerical analysis, statistics, and computer science.

==Career==

In 1956, he was recruited to Dartmouth College by John G. Kemeny and joined the Mathematics Department, where he taught statistics and numerical analysis.

From 1963 to 1964, Kurtz and Kemeny, working with a team of students, led the development of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) and the BASIC programming language. DTSS allowed multiple users at separate terminals to share the processing power of a single machine, replacing a system of exclusive reservations. Kurtz and Kemeny prioritized simplicity, ensuring that DTSS was accessible to users without technical backgrounds.

From 1966 to 1975, Kurtz served as Director of the Kiewit Computation Center at Dartmouth, and from 1975 to 1978, Director of the Office of Academic Computing. In 1979, he and Stephen J. Garland started a Computer and Information Systems master&#x27;s program at Dartmouth. After the program ended in 1988, Kurtz returned to teaching, retiring in 1993.

Kurtz also served as Council Chairman and Trustee of EDUCOM, as well as Trustee and Chairman of NERComP, and on the Pierce Panel of the President&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee. Kurtz also served on the steering committees for the CONDUIT project and the CCUC conferences on instructional computing.

In 1974, the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kurtz and Kemeny at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing. In 1991, the IEEE Computer Society honored Kurtz with the Computer Pioneer Award, and in 1994, he was inducted as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2023, he was inducted as a fellow of the Computer History Museum, with the award presented by Bill Gates.

==BASIC==

As part of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, Kemeny and Kurtz created the programming language BASIC (Beginner&#x27;s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). The first BASIC program ran on May 1, 1964, at 4 a.m. At the time, neither Kemeny nor Kurtz saw this as the start of something monumental. Their main hope was that BASIC would help students in understanding and engaging with the computers they were using. While Dartmouth College held the copyright to BASIC, they made it freely accessible to anyone interested in using it, and Kemeny and Kurtz made little money from it. The name for the language originated from Kurtz&#x27;s wish to have a simple acronym that meant something as well. Kurtz states that: &quot;We wanted a word that was simple but not simple-minded, and BASIC was that one.&quot;

The theme that BASIC was for the average computer user was stressed by Kurtz. In an open letter, he reiterated upon past statements that BASIC was invented to give students a simple programming language that was easy to learn, as all the current languages of the time were dedicated to professionals. He went on to say that BASIC was for people who did not want to dedicate their lives to programming.

Although BASIC was widely regarded as a success, some critics considered it to be confusing for longer programs, especially when the &quot;GO TO&quot; statement was used to jump between parts of a program. In addition, because the language was not designed as a structured language, it made it difficult to split programs into separate parts to improve maintainability.

BASIC standards were created in the 1980s for ECMA and ANSI, with their versions being released in 1986 and 1987 respectively. In 1975, when Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed a version of BASIC for the Altair 8800, one of the earliest personal computers, it helped launch the personal computer industry.

Kurtz&#x27;s work on BASIC was recognized by the IEEE as part of their milestone program, which marks historic places for human innovation from around the world. A commemorative plaque was placed on February 22, 2021.

==True BASIC==
In 1983, Kemeny, Kurtz, and four former Dartmouth students established True BASIC with the goal of introducing a modern commercial version of BASIC that would address the fragmentation caused by numerous incompatible dialects of the language, which were developed for early personal computers with limited memory and hardware-specific limitations. True BASIC featured structured programming constructs such as a do-loop and else-if and support for multiple operating systems.

Initially backed by $2.3 million in investment, the company struggled with profitability. Disagreements with its marketing partner, Addison-Wesley, led True BASIC to take marketing in-house, but sales still fell short of expectations. The company had annual revenues above $1 million in two years, according to the CEO in 1997, but the rise of integrated BASIC implementations, particularly from Microsoft, and declining demand for standalone programming tools limited its market reach. A 2004 interview noted sales of about 3,000 copies of True BASIC annually, primarily to high school students and hobbyists who had learned the language decades earlier.

==Personal life==
Kurtz was married to Patricia Barr from 1953 until their divorce in 1973. They had three children: twin sons Daniel Barr and Timothy David in 1954 and daughter Beth Louise in 1957. In 1974, he married Agnes Seelye Bixler, to whom he remained married until his death.

Kurtz died of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on November 12, 2024, at the age of 96.

<doc id="551225" wikidata="Q1634039" url="?curid=551225" title="Operation Horseshoe">
<text>Operation Horseshoe was a 1999 alleged plan to ethnically cleanse Albanians in Kosovo and to destroy the Kosovo Liberation Army. The plan was to be carried out by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army.

In 2011, former Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Neynsky revealed in a TV documentary that the Bulgarian government in 1999 had turned over to Germany an unverified report compiled by its military agency which &quot;made clear&quot; the existence of the plan, even though the military intelligence had warned that the information could not be verified.

Expulsions of ethnic Albanians did occur during the Kosovo War as Serbian forces expelled 848,000–863,000 Kosovo Albanians and caused the displacement of up to 590,000 within Kosovo.

==History==
In a press conference on 6 April 1999, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer stated that the German government had information that the Yugoslav government had been planning a massive ethnic cleansing operation in Kosovo codenamed &quot;Horseshoe&quot; since 26 February 1999 and had started to implement the operation in March 1999 before the peace talks in France had concluded. Fischer accused Milošević of engaging in &quot;ethnic warfare&quot; directed against his own people in which a whole ethnic group had become the &quot;victim of systematic expulsion&quot; to &quot;reorient the political geography&quot; of Kosovo.
In a press conference on 9 April 1999, German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping provided further details. He presented maps containing the names of towns and villages that showed arrows representing Yugoslav army and police militia units progressively encircling Kosovo in a horseshoe-shaped pincer movement. Scharping stated, &quot;Operation Horseshoe provided clear evidence that President Milosevic (sic) had long been preparing the expulsions from Kosovo and that he had simply used the time gained by the Rambouillet peace talks to organise army and police units for the campaign&quot;.

Contemporaneous reports from other countries supported Fischer&#x27;s allegations. &quot;The Times&quot; of London reported on 8 April 1999 that &quot;The CIA was aware as early as last autumn of a plan, codenamed Operation Horseshoe, to kill or drive them out over several months. A village a day was the rate that Mr Milosevic (sic) calculated the West would wring its hands over without acting.&quot; The British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told a UK parliamentary committee &quot;that there was a plan developed in Belgrade known as Operation Horseshoe which was for the cleansing of Kosovo of its Kosovo population. That plan has been around for some time&quot;. 

In 2012 former Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Neynsky said that the Bulgarian government had delivered information to Germany and NATO in 1999 about Milošević&#x27;s alleged plan for the ethnic cleaning of Kosovo. However, this was in contrast to a statement made in March 2000 by a spokesman for the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, which denied that Neynsky (then Mihaylova) had handed over information to the German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. In 2012 Neynsky stressed that Fischer took the report of the Bulgarian military intelligence very seriously, although Bulgarian military intelligence had warned that the information could not be verified.

==Yugoslav Army military operations==

===Operations before NATO intervention===
Daniel L. Byman and Kenneth M. Pollack date Operation Horseshoe&#x27;s effective beginning to the summer of 1998, when hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians were driven from their homes. Hanspeter Neuhold stated that KLA attacks after the Holbrooke-Milošević Agreement of October 1998 resulted in new Serb offensives which culminated in Operation Horseshoe directed not only against KLA fighters but also including systematic expulsions of Kosovar civilians. Michael J. Dziedzic stated that the Serbian offensive, known as Operation Horseshoe, was already in motion on 20 March 1999.

The UK Parliament Select Committee on Foreign Affairs cited an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe report concluding that before the start of the NATO bombing, the Serbian military campaign did not appear to be oriented towards cantonization (i.e. &quot;aiming to bring together localities according to their ethnic composition&quot;) but rather consisted of

* &quot;activity wherever there was KLA activity, and wherever it was suspected there were KLA sympathisers;
* efforts to control the main communication routes;
* with the approach of the bombing, securing Kosovo&#x27;s borders.&quot;

===Operations after NATO intervention===
Jeremy Black and John Norris both state that after the beginning of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on 24 March 1999, Serbian forces accelerated Operation Horseshoe. Peter Beaumont and Patrick Wintour of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as Milosevic&#x27;s &quot;final solution to the Kosovo problem&quot;. 

The UK Parliament Select Committee on Foreign Affairs stated that &quot;regardless of whether Operation Horseshoe really existed,&quot; after the bombing began, &quot;expulsions took place in practically every municipality.&quot;

According to the verdict of the ICTY, while there is no mention of Operation Horseshoe &quot;per se&quot;,

==Number of refugees==
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, by March 1999 (prior to NATO bombing), more than 200,000 Albanian civilians were internally displaced, almost 70,000 Albanians had fled the province to neighboring countries and Montenegro, and a further 100,000 Yugoslav nationals, mostly Kosovar Albanians, had sought asylum in Western Europe. Also, thousands of ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo had been partially or completely destroyed by burning or shelling.

Within three weeks of the start of NATO strategic bombing during the Kosovo War, there were 525,787 refugees from Kosovo in neighboring countries. A month later, on 12 May, the total number of refugees had risen to 781,618. By June 1999, the Yugoslav military, Serbian police and paramilitaries expelled 862,979 Albanians from Kosovo; the claim was disputed by many Serbian politicians. and several hundred thousand more were internally displaced, in addition to those displaced prior to March. 

Approximately 440,000 refugees crossed the border to Albania and 320,000 to Macedonia. Montenegro hosted around 70,000 refugees, and Bosnia and Herzegovina received more than 30,000. Amnesty International estimated that &quot;nearly one million people have been forced to flee Kosovo&quot;.

Radio Television of Serbia never showed the columns of Albanians expelled by Serbian police and paramilitaries except when a convoy of fleeing Albanians was killed by NATO bombs. Moreover, Milošević&#x27;s propaganda tried to convince the international public that huge columns of refugees fleeing Kosovo were because of NATO&#x27;s bombing, not Yugoslav Army military operations.

==Indictments and Verdicts==
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia charged Slobodan Milošević and other Yugoslav officials with crimes against humanity including murder, forcible population transfer, deportation and persecution of Kosovo civilians. Political scientist Kelly Greenhill observed that Operation Horseshoe was not included in this indictment.

Upon the conclusion of the trial, Presiding Judge Iain Bonomy stated that &quot;It was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 Kosovo Albanians from Kosovo in the short period of time between the end of March and beginning of June 1999&quot;:

* Slobodan Milošević, President of Yugoslavia and Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Army - died in 2006 during trial.
* Dragoljub Ojdanić, Chief of General Staff - sentenced to 15 years in prison; granted early release in August 2013.
* Nebojša Pavković, Commander of Third Army, which was responsible for Kosovo - sentenced to 22 years in prison.
* Vladimir Lazarević, Commander of the Pristina Corps of Third Army - sentenced to 15 years in prison; granted early release, having served two thirds of his sentence, on 7 September 2015, effective 3 December 2015.
* Vlajko Stojiljković, Interior Minister and Commander of the Serbian police - committed suicide in 2002, after the adoption of a law on cooperation with the Hague Tribunal.
* Sreten Lukić, Chief of Staff of the Serbian Police in Kosovo - sentenced to 22 years in prison. Upon appeal, the sentence was reduced on 23 January 2014 to 20 years.
* Nikola Šainović, Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia - sentenced to 22 years in prison. On 26 August 2015, three months after the request by his lawyers, he was released from the prison after serving (including pretrial detention and time served) two thirds of his sentence.
* Milan Milutinović, President of the Republic of Serbia - acquitted.

==Controversy and analysis==
The existence of Operation Horseshoe was immediately denied by Yugoslav officials. Slobodan Milošević labeled it as a &quot;fabrication of the German Defence Ministry&quot;. Milošević denied a policy of ethnic cleansing during the NATO bombing in Kosovo and stated that &quot;when aggression stops, when bombing stops, then it will be very easy to continue (the) political process&quot;.

Ratomir Tanić, a witness at Milošević&#x27;s later war crimes trial, said that Horseshoe was a nickname for a &quot;completely different&quot; Yugoslav army plan that should come into effect only if the ethnic Albanian population took the side of the foreign aggressor in case of aggression on Yugoslavia. The Army would then begin &quot;neutralising the Albanian strongholds&quot;. Tanić stated that the army leadership did not use this plan during the Kosovo War &quot;because there was no external aggression or Albanian rebellion&quot;.

In April 2000, Heinz Loquai, a retired German brigadier general, published a book on the war that claimed that the German government&#x27;s account had been based on a general analysis by a Bulgarian intelligence agency of Yugoslav behaviour in the war that was turned into a specific &quot;plan&quot; by the German Defence Ministry. According to Loquai, the Bulgarian analysis concluded that the goal of the Yugoslav government was to destroy the Kosovo Liberation Army, not to expel the entire Albanian population. He also pointed to a factual flaw in the German government&#x27;s presentation by naming the plan &quot;Potkova&quot;, which is the Croatian and Bulgarian word for horseshoe, but the Serbian word is &quot;potkovica&quot;. Loquai further said that the vague intelligence report had been falsified in order to divert criticism of the bombing campaign in Germany.

In a 2008 article published in the European Journal of Communication, Mark A. Wolfgram observed that 

Greenhill has argued that the evidence does not support a premeditated plan to empty Kosovo of its Albanian inhabitants, as outlined in the alleged Horseshoe plan, describing Milosevic&#x27;s actions as a &quot;two-pronged coercive effort&quot; designed to crush the KLA and deter NATO by using refugees for political and military purposes. Raju G. C. Thomas of Marquette University writes that the pattern of refugee outflow during the war largely began in the west and southwest, increasing in the north-central of Kosovo before moving back to the south/southwest. This contradicted claims by scholars like Ivo H. Daalder and Michael E. O’Hanlon in &quot;Winning Ugly NATO&#x27;s War to Save Kosovo&quot; which said the attack involved &quot;a broad swath of territory in the shape of a horseshoe, moving from the northeast down to the west and back to the southeast.&quot;

==Aftermath== 
It is unclear how much advance planning there was for the alleged ethnic cleansing of Kosovo, but the removal of ethnic Albanians was counterproductive as, according to British reporter and political analyst Tim Judah, it removed any possibility that Serbia would be allowed to retain control of Kosovo. The government of Serbia did not expect NATO to initiate its bombing campaign. The systematic destruction of Kosovo Albanian identity documents would have made it more difficult for them to prove their citizenship.

<text>Louis Claude Frédéric Masson (8 March 1847, Paris – 19 February 1923, Paris) was a French historian.

== Life and career ==
His father, Francis Masson, a solicitor, was killed on 23 June 1848 when he was a major in the &quot;garde nationale&quot;. Young Masson was educated at the college of Sainte Barbe, and at the lycée Louis-le-Grand, and then travelled in Germany and in England. From 1869 to 1880 he was librarian at the Foreign Office.

At first he devoted himself to the history of diplomacy, and published between 1877 and 1884 several volumes connected with that subject. Later he published a number of more or less curious memoirs illustrating the history of the Revolution and of the empire.

But he is best known for his books connected with Napoleon. In &quot;Napoléon inconnu&quot; (1895), Masson, together with Guido Biagi, brought out the unpublished writings (1786-1793) of the future emperor. These were notes, extracts from historical, philosophical and literary books, and personal reflections in which one can watch the growth of the ideas later carried out by the emperor with modifications necessitated by the force of circumstances and his own genius. But this was only one in a remarkable series:
*&quot;Joséphine de Beauharnais, 1763-1796&quot; (1898)
*&quot;Joséphine, impératrice et reine&quot; (1899)
*&quot;Joséphine répudiée 1809-1814&quot; (1901)
*&quot;L&#x27;Impératrice Marie Louise&quot; (1902)
*&quot;Napoléon et les femmes&quot; (1894)
*&quot;Napoléon et sa famille&quot; (9 vols., 1897-1907)
*&quot;Napoléon et son fils&quot; (1904)
*&quot;Autour de l&#x27;Île d&#x27;Elbe&quot; (1908).
These works abound in details and amusing anecdotes, which throw much light on the events and men of the time, laying stress on the personal, romantic and dramatic aspects of history. The author was made a member of the Académie française in 1903. From 1886 to 1889 he edited the review &quot;Arts and Letters&quot;, published in London and New York.

A bibliography of his works, including anonymous ones and those under an assumed name, has been published by Georges Vicaire (&quot;Manuel de l&#x27;amateur des livres du XIX siècle&quot;, tome v., 1904). &quot;Napoléon et les femmes&quot; has been translated into English as &quot;Napoleon and the Fair Sex&quot; (1894). Another translation by J. M. Howell appeared under the title: &quot;Napoleon: lover and husband&quot; (1894).

His personal library, his papers, his collection of paintings and objects about Napoléon are conserved now in the Fondation Dosne-Thiers, 27 place Saint-Georges, 75009 Paris (France).

<text>BepiColombo is a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to the planet Mercury. The mission comprises two satellites launched together: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and Mio (Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, MMO). The mission will perform a comprehensive study of Mercury, including characterization of its magnetic field, magnetosphere, and both interior and surface structure. It was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket on 20 October 2018 at 01:45 UTC, with an arrival at Mercury planned for November 2026, after a flyby of Earth, two flybys of Venus, and six flybys of Mercury. The mission was approved in November 2009, after years in proposal and planning as part of the European Space Agency&#x27;s Horizon 2000+ programme; it is the last mission of the programme to be launched.

On 15 May 2024, ESA reported that a &quot;glitch&quot; prevented the spacecraft&#x27;s thrusters from operating at full power during a scheduled manoeuvre on 26 April. On 2 September, ESA reported that to compensate for the reduced available thrust, a revised trajectory had been developed that would add 11 months to the cruise, delaying the expected arrival date from 5 December 2025 to November 2026.

== Names ==
&quot;BepiColombo&quot; is named after Giuseppe &quot;Bepi&quot; Colombo (1920–1984), a scientist, mathematician and engineer at the University of Padua, Italy, who first proposed the interplanetary gravity assist manoeuvre used by the 1974 &quot;Mariner 10&quot; mission, a technique now used frequently by planetary probes.

&quot;Mio&quot;, the name of the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, was selected from thousands of suggestions by the Japanese public. In Japanese, &quot;Mio&quot; means a waterway, and according to JAXA, it symbolizes the research and development milestones reached thus far, and wishes for safe travel ahead. JAXA said the spacecraft will travel through the solar wind just like a ship traveling through the ocean. In Chinese and Japanese, Mercury is known as the &quot;water star&quot; (水星) according to &quot;wǔxíng&quot;.

Following its Earth flyby in April 2020, &quot;BepiColombo&quot; was briefly mistaken for a near-Earth asteroid, receiving the provisional designation .

== Mission ==
The mission involves three components, which will separate into independent spacecraft upon arrival at Mercury.
* Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) for propulsion, built by ESA.
* Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) built by ESA.
* Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) or &quot;Mio&quot; built by JAXA.

During the launch and cruise phases, these three components are joined together (with the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface or MOSIF between &quot;Mio&quot; and MPO) to form the Mercury Cruise System (MCS).

The prime contractor for ESA is Airbus Defence and Space. ESA is responsible for the overall mission, the design, development assembly and test of the propulsion and MPO modules, and the launch. The two orbiters, which are operated by mission controllers based in Darmstadt, Germany, were successfully launched together on 20 October 2018. The launch took place on Ariane flight VA245 from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The spacecraft will have an eight-year interplanetary cruise to Mercury using solar-electric propulsion (ion thrusters) and gravity assists from Earth, Venus and eventual gravity capture at Mercury. ESA&#x27;s Cebreros, Spain ground station is planned to be the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases.

Expected to arrive in Mercury orbit in November 2026, the &quot;Mio&quot; and MPO satellites will separate and observe Mercury in collaboration for one year, with a possible one-year extension. Although originally expected to enter orbit in December 2025, thruster issues discovered in September 2024 before its 4th flyby resulted in a delayed arrival of November 2026. The orbiters are equipped with scientific instruments provided by various European countries and Japan. The mission will characterize the solid and liquid iron core ( of the planet&#x27;s radius) and determine the size of each. The mission will also complete gravitational and magnetic field mappings. Russia provided gamma ray and neutron spectrometers to verify the existence of water ice in polar craters that are permanently in shadow from the Sun&#x27;s rays.

Mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time, but it has a &quot;tenuous surface-bounded exosphere&quot; containing hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium and other trace elements. Its exosphere is not stable as atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources. The mission will study the exosphere composition and dynamics, including generation and escape.

=== Objectives ===
The main objectives of the mission are:

* Study the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star
* Study Mercury&#x27;s form, interior, structure, geology, composition and craters
* Investigate Mercury&#x27;s exosphere, composition and dynamics, including generation and escape
* Study Mercury&#x27;s magnetised envelope (magnetosphere) – structure and dynamics
* Investigate the origin of Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field
* Verify Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity by measuring the parameters &quot;gamma&quot; and &quot;beta&quot; of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism with high accuracy.

=== Design ===
The stacked spacecraft will take eight years to position itself to enter Mercury orbit. During this time it will use solar-electric propulsion and nine gravity assists, flying past the Earth and Moon in April 2020, Venus in 2020 and 2021, and six Mercury flybys between 2021 and 2025.

The stacked spacecraft left Earth with a hyperbolic excess velocity of . Initially, the craft was placed in a heliocentric orbit similar to that of Earth. After both the spacecraft and Earth completed one and a half orbits, it returned to Earth to perform a gravity-assist maneuver and is deflected towards Venus. Two consecutive Venus flybys reduce the perihelion near to the Sun–Mercury distance with almost no need for thrust. A sequence of six Mercury flybys will lower the relative velocity to . After the fourth Mercury flyby, the craft will be in an orbit similar to that of Mercury and will remain in the general vicinity of Mercury (see ). Four final thrust arcs reduce the relative velocity to the point where Mercury will &quot;weakly&quot; capture the spacecraft in November 2026 into polar orbit. Only a small maneuver is needed to bring the craft into an orbit around Mercury with an apocentre of . The orbiters then separate and will adjust their orbits using chemical thrusters.

=== History ===
The &quot;BepiColombo&quot; mission proposal was selected by ESA in 2000. A request for proposals for the science payload was issued in 2004. In 2007, Astrium was selected as the prime contractor, and Ariane 5 chosen as the launch vehicle. The initial target launch of July 2014 was postponed several times, mostly because of delays on the development of the solar electric propulsion system. The total cost of the mission was estimated in 2017 as US$2 billion.

=== Schedule ===

, the mission schedule is:

== Components ==
=== Mercury Transfer Module ===

The Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) has a mass of , including of xenon propellant, and is located at the base of the stack. Its role is to carry the two science orbiters to Mercury and to support them during the cruise.

The MTM is equipped with a solar electric propulsion system as the main spacecraft propulsion. Its four QinetiQ-T6 ion thrusters operate singly or in pairs for a maximum combined thrust of 290 mN, making it the most powerful ion engine array ever operated in space. The MTM supplies electrical power for the two hibernating orbiters as well as for its solar electric propulsion system thanks to two solar panels. Depending on the probe&#x27;s distance to the Sun, the generated power will range between 7 and 14 kW, each T6 requiring between 2.5 and 4.5 kW according to the desired thrust level.

The solar electric propulsion system has typically very high specific impulse and low thrust. This leads to a flight profile with months-long continuous low-thrust braking phases, interrupted by planetary gravity assists, to gradually reduce the velocity of the spacecraft. Moments before Mercury orbit insertion, the MTM will be jettisoned from the spacecraft stack. After separation from the MTM, the MPO will provide &quot;Mio&quot; all necessary power and data resources until &quot;Mio&quot; is delivered to its mission orbit; separation of &quot;Mio&quot; from MPO will be accomplished by spin-ejection.

=== Mercury Planetary Orbiter ===

The Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) has a mass of and uses a single-sided solar array capable of providing up to 1000 watts and featuring Optical Solar Reflectors to keep its temperature below . The solar array requires continuous rotation keeping the Sun at a low incidence angle in order to generate adequate power while at the same time limiting the temperature.

The MPO will carry a payload of 11 instruments, comprising cameras, spectrometers (IR, UV, X-ray, γ-ray, neutron), a radiometer, a laser altimeter, a magnetometer, particle analysers, a Ka-band transponder, and an accelerometer. The payload components are mounted on the nadir side of the spacecraft to achieve low detector temperatures, apart from the MERTIS and PHEBUS spectrometers located directly at the main radiator to provide a better field of view.

A high-temperature-resistant diameter high-gain antenna is mounted on a short boom on the zenith side of the spacecraft. Communications will be on the X-band and Ka-band with an average bit rate of 50 kbit/s and a total data volume of 1550 Gbit/year. ESA&#x27;s Cebreros, Spain ground station is planned to be the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases.

==== Science payload ====

The science payload of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter consists of eleven instruments:

* BepiColombo Laser Altimeter (BELA), developed by DLR in cooperation with the University of Bern, the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía.

* Mercury Orbiter Radio-science Experiment (MORE), developed by Italy and the United States
* Probing of Hermean Exosphere by Ultraviolet Spectroscopy (PHEBUS), developed by France and Russia
* Search for Exosphere Refilling and Emitted Neutral Abundances (SERENA), made up of 2 neutral and 2 ionised particle analysers:
**ELENA (Emitted Low-Energy Neutral Atoms) developed by Italy;
**STROFIO (STart from a ROtating Field mass spectrOmeter) developed by United States;
**MIPA (Miniature Ion Precipitation Analyser) developed by Sweden;
**PICAM (Planetary Ion CAMera) developed by the Space Research Institute (Institut für Weltraumforschung, IWF), Russian Space Research Institute (IKI), Institut de recherche en sciences de l&#x27;environnement (CETP/IPSL), European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Research Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics (KFKI-RMKI) and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS).
* Spectrometers and Imagers for MPO BepiColombo Integrated Observatory System (SIMBIO-SYS), high resolution stereo cameras and a visual and near infrared spectrometer, developed by Italy, France and Switzerland
* Solar Intensity X-ray and Particle Spectrometer (SIXS), developed by Finland and United Kingdom.

=== &quot;Mio&quot; (Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter) ===
&quot;Mio&quot;, or the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), developed and built mostly by Japan, has the shape of a short octagonal prism, long from face to face and high. It has a mass of , including a scientific payload consisting of 5 instrument groups, 4 for plasma and dust measuring run by investigators from Japan, and one magnetometer from Austria.

&quot;Mio&quot; will be spin stabilized at 15 rpm with the spin axis perpendicular to the equator of Mercury. It will enter a polar orbit at an altitude of , outside of MPO&#x27;s orbit. The top and bottom of the octagon act as radiators with louvers for active temperature control. The sides are covered with solar cells which provide 90 watts. Communications with Earth will be through a diameter X-band phased array high-gain antenna and two medium-gain antennas operating in the X-band. Telemetry will return 160 Gb/year, about 5 kbit/s over the lifetime of the spacecraft, which is expected to be greater than one year. The reaction and control system is based on cold gas thrusters. After its release in Mercury orbit, &quot;Mio&quot; will be operated by Sagamihara Space Operation Center using Usuda Deep Space Center antenna located in Nagano, Japan.

==== Science payload ====

&quot;Mio&quot; carries five groups of science instruments with a total mass of :
* Mercury Plasma Particle Experiment (MPPE), studies the plasma and neutral particles from the planet, its magnetosphere, and the solar wind. It will employ these instruments:
** Mercury Electron Analyzers (MEA1 and MEA2)
** Mercury Ion Analyzer (MIA)
** Mass Spectrum Analyzer (MSA), developed by Laboratory of Plasma Physics (LPP), Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), IDA of Technical University of Braunschweig and Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) 
** High-Energy Particle instrument for electrons (HEP-ele)
** High-Energy Particle instrument for Ions (HEP-ion)
** Energetic Neutrals Analyzer (ENA)
* Mercury Magnetometer (MMO-MGF), studies Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field, magnetosphere, and interplanetary solar wind
* Plasma Wave Investigation (PWI), studies the electric field, electromagnetic waves, and radio waves from the magnetosphere and solar wind
* Mercury Sodium Atmosphere Spectral Imager (MSASI), studies the thin sodium atmosphere of Mercury
* Mercury Dust Monitor (MDM), studies dust from the planet and interplanetary space

==== Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface ====
The &quot;Mio&quot; orbiter requires additional thermal control on the cruise to Mercury, in addition to umbilicals to the MPO. The European Space Agency thus provided the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface (MOSIF), a white shroud that is shaped like a conical frustrum to provide clearance, as &quot;Mio&quot; is spun up during its separation in 2026, before being ejected from the MPO.

=== Mercury Surface Element (cancelled) ===
The Mercury Surface Element (MSE) was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints. At the time of cancellation, MSE was meant to be a small, , lander designed to operate for about one week on the surface of Mercury. Shaped as a diameter disc, it was designed to land at a latitude of 85° near the terminator region. Braking manoeuvres would bring the lander to zero velocity at an altitude of at which point the propulsion unit would be ejected, airbags inflated, and the module would fall to the surface with a maximum impact velocity of . Scientific data would be stored onboard and relayed via a cross-dipole UHF antenna to either the MPO or &quot;Mio&quot;. The MSE would have carried a payload consisting of an imaging system (a descent camera and a surface camera), a heat flow and physical properties package, an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer, a magnetometer, a seismometer, a soil penetrating device (mole), and a micro-rover.

<text>The Phoenix is an Irish political and current affairs magazine, established in 1983 by John Mulcahy. Inspired by the British magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, the magazine has been edited by Paddy Prendeville since 1984. The publication is generally fortnightly, with a larger annual issue each December. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; &quot;produces a fortnightly diet, humour, financial analysis, and news with an insider slant from the worlds of security, politics, media, arts, and law.&quot;

==History and operations==
The magazine was launched in January 1983. It was established by journalist and publisher John Mulcahy, who oversaw its operations until 2007. The name &quot;Phoenix&quot; is a reference to its &quot;emergence from the ashes&quot; of two of Mulcahy&#x27;s previous publications. These were the republican political magazine &quot;Hibernia&quot;, which ceased publishing in 1980 after a libel action, and the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; newspaper, which first collapsed financially in 1982.

Published by a company named Penfield Enterprises Ltd., and based on Baggot Street, the magazine had an ABC-audited circulation of 19,014 for 2004 and 18,268 in 2007.

The primary editor of the magazine is Paddy Prendiville, who took the role about a year after the magazine was started

The magazine secures much of its material from &quot;insider&quot; sources, and promotes contact with its &quot;Goldhawk&quot; phone line.

==Layout and style==
Features in the magazine include a news column; detailed profiles (&quot;Pillars of Society&quot; and &quot;The Young Bloods&quot;); &quot;Affairs of the Nation&quot;, which looks at political scandals; &quot;Bog Cuttings&quot; which consists of humorous and unusual events outside Dublin (often bizarre court cases), &quot;Hush Hush&quot; and &quot;On the beat&quot;, which deals with security and intelligence matters; and a satirical section, &quot;Craic and Codology&quot;. It also has an extensive financial column, &quot;Moneybags&quot;.

Like &quot;Private Eye&quot;, the cover features a photo montage with a speech bubble, putting ironic or humorous comments into the mouths of the famous in response to topical events. Other features include an &quot;Apology&quot; section (where the magazine offers an ersatz apology for the failings or success of some person or event), &quot;That Menu in Full&quot;, the use of (&quot;That&#x27;s enough of this. -Ed&quot; type interjections) and their derivatives, and the Christmas Gift lists, where implausible gifts with ridiculous features are offered for sale.

In contrast to &quot;Private Eye&quot;, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; is printed on magazine stock rather than newsprint, and uses colour, including photography, quite extensively.

==Positions==

In the 1980s, the Workers&#x27; Party was a frequent target of satire and investigation over its funding methods, which resulted in &quot;Phoenix&quot; founder John Mulcahy receiving threats from the Official IRA.

In the late 2000s, it was highly critical of the Corrib gas pipeline and supported the Shell to Sea and Pobal Chill Chomáin campaigns against the laying of the pipeline. It published a supplementary summary and commentary on the Goldstone Report on the siege of Gaza and attacked the actions of the Israeli government over the illegal use of Irish passports in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, and the Gaza flotilla raid. The magazine was highly critical of the 2007–2011 Fianna Fáil–Green Party coalition. It called for the 2011 Irish budget to be defeated and pointed out that the money loaned as part of the EU stability fund would come at the cost of a crippling rate of interest.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; was highly critical of Ukraine, and accused the Irish media of seeking to undermine Irish neutrality by exploiting &quot;Ukrainian misery&quot;.

<text>GTV is a commercial television station in Melbourne, Australia, owned by the Nine Network. The station is currently based at studios at 717 Bourke Street, Docklands. GTV-9 is the home of the Australian Open tennis coverage.

==History==

GTV-9 was amongst the first television stations to begin regular transmission in Australia. Test transmissions began on 27 September 1956, introduced by former 3DB radio announcer Geoff Corke, based at the Mount Dandenong transmitter, as the studios in Richmond were not yet ready. The station covered the 1956 Summer Olympics which Melbourne hosted., the 1956 Carols By Candlelight and the Davis Cup tennis as part of its test transmissions.

The station was officially opened on 19 January 1957 by Victorian Governor 
Sir Dallas Brooks from the studios in Bendigo Street, Richmond. GTV-9 was the third television station to launch in Victoria after HSV-7 and ABV-2, on 19 January 1957. A clip from the ceremony has featured in a number of GTV-9 retrospectives, in which the Governor advises viewers that if they did not like the programs, they could just turn off.
The Richmond building, bearing the name &quot;Television City&quot;, had been converted from a Heinz tinned food factory, also occupied in the past by the Wertheim Piano Company (from 1908 to 1935). A cornerstone, now visible from the staff canteen courtyard, was laid when construction of the Piano factory began.

Eric Pearce was appointed senior newsreader in the late 1960s, after having been the first newsreader at rival station HSV-7. He held that position for almost twenty years. In 1957, GTV-9&#x27;s first large-scale production was the nightly variety show &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; (&quot;IMT&quot;), hosted by Graham Kennedy. Kennedy was a radio announcer at 3UZ in Melbourne before being &#x27;discovered&#x27; by GTV-9 producer Norm Spencer, when appearing on a GTV-9 telethon. Bert Newton moved from HSV-7 to join Kennedy. &quot;IMT&quot; continued for thirteen years, dominating Melbourne&#x27;s television scene for most of that time. It set a precedent for a number of subsequent live variety programmes from the station.

Ownership has changed over the decades. The station was first licensed to the &quot;General Television Corporation Ltd.&quot;, a consortium of two newspapers, The Argus and The Age, together with cinema chains Hoyts, Greater Union, Sir Arthur Warner&#x27;s Electronic Industries, JC Williamson&#x27;s Theatres, Cinesound Productions, and radio stations 3XY, 3UZ, 3KZ. In early 1957 The Argus was acquired by The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, and the paper was closed on the same day that GTV-9 officially opened. The Herald in turn sold its interests in the station to Electronic Industries, later acquired by UK television manufacturer Pye, in 1960. Because of the restriction on foreign ownership of television stations, GTV-9 was then sold to Frank Packer&#x27;s Australian Consolidated Press, which already owned TCN-9 in Sydney, resulting in the formation of the country&#x27;s first commercially owned television network. Prior to this GTV-9 was affiliated with ATN-7 in Sydney. Son Clyde Packer ran the network for some time, until a falling out led to a handover to younger son Kerry Packer. In the 1980s the network was sold to Alan Bond, but later bought back at a much lower price.
Following the death of Kerry Packer, his son James Packer progressively sold down his stake in the network. (See also Publishing and Broadcasting Limited.)

Along with most Australian TV stations, GTV-9 commenced colour test transmissions in October 1974. The official changeover took place at 12.00am on Saturday 1 March 1975. In 1976, GTV-9 became the first Australian television station to commence permanent 24-hour transmission. In 2001 the station commenced digital television broadcasting, in line with most other metropolitan stations. GTV-9 continued broadcasting in analogue on VHF9, with a digital simulcast on VHF8.

In 2010 it was announced to public and then staff, that after 54 years at Bendigo Street, GTV-9 would move day-to-day operations including News and commercial sales to 717 Bourke Street, Docklands. On 25 October 2010, it was announced that GTV-9 would begin producing larger scale studio productions, such as The Footy Show, Hey Hey its Saturday, and Millionaire Hotseat from the new Docklands Studios Melbourne.

On 28 February 2011, GTV-9 broadcast its final live program – the 6pm edition of &quot;Nine News&quot; – from the Richmond &quot;Television City&quot; studios, and the following day began broadcasting news bulletins from 717 Bourke Street. Also while their new fibre link to their transmission site was being completed, a temporary DVB-S2 link was put up on Optus D1, which ceased at the end of the year.

In 2012, no new programming has been produced out of the new studios. The network opted to move &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and its host Tracy Grimshaw to TCN-9 in Sydney.

In May 2012, a lower powered permanent backup DVB-S2 link for their transmission site was re-established on Optus D1, which requires at least a two-metre solid receiving dish.

=== Former presenters ===
Eric Pearce, who was knighted after his retirement, was GTV-9&#x27;s chief news presenter from the late 1950s until 1974. After his first retirement, the subsequent American style &quot;NewsCentre Nine&quot; presented by Peter Hitchener did not rate well, so Pearce was persuaded to return in 1976, remaining until 1978.

In 1978, former HSV-7 news presenter Brian Naylor joined as GTV-9&#x27;s chief weeknight news presenter, with Hitchener on weekends. Naylor&#x27;s association with Nine lasted 20 years – he retired at the end of 1998, with Naylor replaced by then deputy news presenter Peter Hitchener. Jo Hall took over on weekends, with Tony Jones the main weekend fill-in.

Other main presenters of &quot;Nine News Melbourne&quot; included Tracy Grimshaw (1981–1993), and Tracey Curro, who also worked on Nine&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and Jo Hall (1998–2011).

Past weekend sport presenters in recent years have included Leith Mulligan (1999–2006), Heath O&#x27;Loughlin (2006–2008), Grant Hackett (2008–2009) and Lisa Andrews (2009–2011). Rob Gell was the previous weather presenter he held the position for fifteen years from 1988 to 2004.

==GTV 9 Football Club==
The GTV 9 Football Club, sometimes stylised as GTV-9 or GTV9 and nicknamed the Gunners, was an Australian rules football club that competed in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The club represented GTV and wore the nine dots that were used in the station&#x27;s branding.

GTV 9 was formed in 1986 and joined the VAFA the same year, competing in the newly created G Section. The club made finals in its first season, finishing fourth on the ladder before being defeated by Parkside in the first semi-final.

The club struggled in its second season in 1987, winning just three games and finishing 11th on the ladder, resulting in the club&#x27;s relegation to H Section for the 1988 season.

GTV 9 significantly improved in 1988, winning 14 out of 16 games, however they were defeated in the preliminary final by St Kevin&#x27;s. GTV 9 player Tony Fox was awarded joint H Section best-and-fairest winner for the 1988 season.

The club won five out of 16 games in its final season in 1989, finishing second last on the H Section ladder. GTV 9 subsequently folded before the 1990 season.

<text>Mordecai Ardon (, 13 July 1896 – 18 June 1992) was an Israeli painter.

==Biography==
Max Bronstein (later Mordecai Ardon) was born in Tuchów, Galicia (then Austria-Hungary, now Poland). He pursued architecture between 1921-1925 in the Bauhaus University in Weimar, Germany. Studying among other notable painters such as Johannes Itten, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee. For about a year, following his studies, he worked with Max Doerner at the Academy of Decorative Arts in Munich. In 1933 he immigrated to Mandate Palestine, settling in Jerusalem. He was granted British Mandatory Palestinian citizenship in 1936 and changed his name to Mordecai Ardon.
After settling in Jerusalem, he would go on to become a teacher in the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in 1935. Between 1940 and 1952, he served as its director. From 1952 to 1963 he became the artistic adviser to the Ministry of Education and Culture of Israel.

==Art career==
He participated in the Venice Biennale of 1968.

Beginning in the 1950s Ardon adopted a complex system of symbolic images in his paintings, taken from the Jewish Mystical tradition (Kabbalah), from the Bible and from a tangible reality. In his painting &quot;Gates of Light&quot;, for example, he expressed &quot;the inner mystery and timelessness of the landscape.&quot; His work seeks to impart a cosmic dimension to the present, linking it to antiquity and mystery. The same approach can be found in &quot;At the Gates of Jerusalem&quot; (1967), which shows the attempt to &quot;convey his feelings about the cosmic significance of Israel&#x27;s return to the Old City of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War&quot;. &quot;Bird near a yellow wall&quot; (1950) demonstrates his simplistic involvement with the Holocaust, a subject to which he was one of the few Israeli artists to devote a phase of his work, at that time.

As a teacher and director of the &quot;New Bezalel&quot;, Ardon conveyed his sense of social involvement, his tendency towards Jewish mysticism and local mythology, and the combination of personal national symbols with reality-always stressing masterful technique. Pupils such as Avigdor Arikha, Yehuda Bacon, Naftali Bezem, Shraga Weil, Shmuel Boneh, and Bernat Klein absorbed these influences and integrated them into their later work.

Ardon was seen as the father of the regional approach in Israeli art.

One of his most famous creations are the &quot;Isaiah’s Vision of Eternal Peace&quot; (1980–1984), a set of large stained-glass windows displayed prominently in the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, incorporating visual elements from the Kabbalah.

Ardon died in Jerusalem in 1992.

In 2014 his painting &quot;The Awakening&quot; (1969) was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $821,000.
In 2006 his painting &quot;The Woodpecker of Time&quot; (1963) was sold at Christie&#x27;s for $643,200.

<text>Martin Wilhelm Kutta (; 3 November 1867 – 25 December 1944) was a German mathematician.
In 1901, he co-developed the Runge–Kutta method, used to solve ordinary differential equations numerically. He is also remembered for the Zhukovsky–Kutta aerofoil, the Kutta–Zhukovsky theorem and the Kutta condition in aerodynamics. 

Kutta was born in Pitschen, Upper Silesia, Kingdom of Prussia (today Byczyna, Poland). He attended the University of Breslau from 1885 to 1890, and continued his studies in Munich until 1894, where he became the assistant of Walther Franz Anton von Dyck. From 1898, he spent half a year at the University of Cambridge. From 1899 to 1909, he worked again as an assistant of von Dyck in Munich; from 1909 to 1910, he was adjunct professor at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. He was professor at the RWTH Aachen from 1910 to 1912. Kutta became professor at the University of Stuttgart in 1912, where he stayed until his retirement in 1935.
Kutta died in Fürstenfeldbruck, Germany in 1944.

<text>The Battle of the Weser River, sometimes known as the First Battle of Minden or Battle of Idistaviso, was fought in 16 AD between Roman legions commanded by Roman Emperor Tiberius&#x27;s heir and adopted son, Germanicus, and an alliance of Germanic peoples, commanded by Arminius. The battle marked the end of a three-year series of campaigns by Germanicus in Germania.

==Background==
The Germanic chief, Arminius, had been instrumental in the organising of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, in which three Roman legions moving west to winter quarters were ambushed and annihilated by allied Germanic forces in the deep forests of western Germania. That defeat plagued the Roman psyche, and revenge and the neutralisation of the threat of Arminius were the impetus for Germanicus&#x27; campaign. In the year before the battle, 15 AD, Germanicus had marched against the Chatti and then against the Cherusci under Arminius. During that campaign, the Romans advanced along the region of the Teutoburg Forest, where the legions had been massacred and buried the bones of the Roman soldiers that still lay there. The eagle of the annihilated nineteenth legion was also recovered.

Skirmishes with the Germans were constant, but the Romans could not draw them into open battle.

==Location==
Ancient sources identify the location as &quot;Idistavisus&quot;, but the precise location is unknown except that it was on the right side of the Weser River, somewhere between the cities of Minden and Hamelin in what is now Germany.

==Battle==

The Germanic tribes generally avoided open large-scale combat, but by repeated Roman incursions deep into Germanic territory, Germanicus was able to force Arminius, at the head of a large but fractious coalition, into response. The Romans, along with the Chauci, who fought for Romans as auxiliaries, defeated the allied Germanic forces and inflicted heavy losses on them. Arminius and his uncle Inguiomer were wounded in the battle, but both evaded capture. The retreating Germanic army was cut down in every quarter. Many attempting to swim across the Weser died from a storm of projectiles or by the force of the current. Many others climbed the tops of trees, and while they were hiding themselves in the boughs, the Romans brought archers up to shoot them down.

According to Tacitus, &quot;[f]rom nine in the morning to nightfall the [Germans] were slaughtered, and ten miles were covered with arms and dead bodies.&quot; The Roman soldiers involved on the battlefield hailed Tiberius as imperator and raised a pile of arms as a trophy with the names of the defeated tribes inscribed beneath them.

==Aftermath==
The sight of the Roman trophy constructed on the battlefield enraged the Germans who were preparing to retreat beyond the Elbe, and they launched an attack on the Roman positions at the Angrivarian Wall, thus beginning a second battle. The Romans had anticipated the attack and again routed the Germans. Germanicus stated that he did not want any prisoners, as the extermination of the Germanic tribes was the only conclusion he saw for the war. The victorious Romans then raised a mound with the inscription: &quot;The army of Tiberius Caesar, after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the Rhine and the Elbe, has dedicated this monument to Mars, Jupiter, and Augustus.&quot;

Afterwards, Germanicus ordered Caius Silius to march against the Chatti with a mixed force of 3,000 cavalry and 33,000 infantry and lay waste of their territory. Meanwhile, Germanicus himself, with a larger army, invaded the Marsi for the third time and devastated their land, defeating any foe he encountered.

Germanicus then withdrew his soldiers behind the Rhine for the winter. According to Tacitus, it was taken as certain that the Germanic tribes were considering suing for peace, and that an additional campaign in the next summer would end the war. However, Tiberius advised Germanicus to return to Rome, writing to him that while &quot;[h]e had fought victorious battles on a great scale; he should also remember those losses which the winds and waves had inflicted, and which, though due to no fault of the general, were still grievous and shocking&quot; and that &quot;since the vengeance of Rome had been satisfied, [the Germans] might be left to their internal feuds.&quot; Germanicus was granted a triumph on May 26, AD 17 in exchange for his return from Germania.

== In fiction ==
In Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, the procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate, states that he had fought in this battle.

<text>The Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) is a game engine developed by Sierra On-Line. The company originally developed the engine for &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; (1984), an adventure game that Sierra and IBM wished to market in order to attract consumers to IBM&#x27;s lower-cost home computer, the IBM PCjr.

AGI was capable of running animated, color adventure games with music and sound effects. The player controls the game with a keyboard and, optionally, a joystick.

After the launch of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, Sierra continued to develop and improve the Adventure Game Interpreter. They employed it in 14 of their games between 1984 and 1989, before replacing it with a more sophisticated engine, Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter.

==History==
In late 1982, IBM began work on the PCjr, a lower-priced variant of the IBM Personal Computer with improved graphics and sound. The PCjr&#x27;s Video Gate Array video adapter could display up to 16 colors at a time—a major improvement over the Color Graphics Adapter&#x27;s four-color limit. The new sound chip, too, could output a wider range of tones than the PC speaker.

IBM commissioned Sierra to produce a game that could showcase these new capabilities. They discussed some requirements for the game, and IBM supplied Sierra with a PCjr prototype. They both agreed that the game should be animated—a first for Sierra. A team of six designers and developers, led by designer Roberta Williams, worked on the game that was eventually titled &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;. Among the developers were Chuck Tingley and Ken MacNeill (later releases also credit Chris Iden. An Apple II version credits Arthur Abraham).

IBM premiered the PCjr in 1984; it did not sell well and, therefore, neither did &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;. However, later that year Tandy Corporation released the Tandy 1000, an IBM PC compatible that succeeded where the PCjr failed. &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; caused a sensation in the burgeoning market of PC-compatible computers, and Sierra sold more than half a million copies. They ported it to other computers, including the Apple II, Apple IIGS, Mac, Amiga, and Atari ST, but IBM PC compatibles remained the primary platform for their games.

In 1988, with the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella&quot;, Sierra debuted a more sophisticated game engine: Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter, or SCI. Since the SCI engine required a more powerful home computer, Sierra released an AGI version of the game at the same time. However, Sierra overestimated consumer demand for the lesser version, and ceased production.

The following year, Sierra published its final AGI-based title, &quot;Manhunter 2: San Francisco&quot;, then focused exclusively on SCI for new adventure game development. Among SCI&#x27;s enhancements were a more versatile scripting system, an object-oriented programming model, higher-resolution graphics (320×200 rather than 160×200), a point-and-click interface, and support for additional sound card hardware.

==Technical design==
The technical complexity of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; made it a burden to write in assembly language, so the programmers created a game engine to simplify development. The engine comprised a bespoke programming language called the Game Adaptation Language, a compiler, and a bytecode interpreter (the Adventure Game Interpreter). The Game Adaptation Language was a high-level programming language that resembled C. This was compiled into bytecode, which was executed by the interpreter.

Like Sierra&#x27;s earlier adventure titles, such as &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot; (1980), AGI games used vector graphics. The PCjr accepted floppy disks with a capacity of 360 kilobytes, and raster graphics would have consumed an excessive amount of disk space. Instead, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; drew polygons on the screen, and then colored them. Beginning with AGI version 2, the game engine drew graphics in an off-screen data buffer, then blitted them into video memory. This approach was not just to economize use of system resources; it also prevented the game from revealing hidden objects while it drew the screen.

AGI was principally developed for 16-bit computer architectures, which were the state of the art in home computers at the time. These included the IBM PC compatible, the Atari ST, Commodore&#x27;s Amiga series, and Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computers. In addition, Sierra ported AGI to three 8-bit computer models: the TRS-80 Color Computer, the Apple IIe, and the Apple IIc.

<text>Idistaviso is the location on the Weser river where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 CE, attested in chapter 16 of Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Annales&quot; II. The name was amended by Karl Müllenhoff and Jacob Grimm in the 19th century to Idisiaviso, meaning &quot;plain of the Idisi&quot; or &quot;women&#x27;s meadow&quot;.

==Theories==
Rudolf Simek states that &quot;as the Idisi are supposed to have an influence in the outcome of a battle, similarities with the valkyries suggest themselves. Idisiaviso would thus be a place at which the Idisi had once been instrumental in a battle.&quot;

Several etymologies of Iðavöllr (a location in Norse mythology) have been proposed, and the meaning of the name is considered unclear. If Iðavöllr is emended to &quot;*Ið[is]avöllr&quot;, the location name corresponds precisely to &quot;Idisiaviso&quot;.

<text>Captain &amp; Tennille were an American recording duo whose primary success occurred in the 1970s. The husband-and-wife team were &quot;Captain&quot; Daryl Dragon (1942–2019) and Toni Tennille (born 1940). They have five albums certified gold or platinum and scored numerous hits on the US singles charts, the most enduring of which included &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot;, &quot;Do That to Me One More Time&quot;, and &quot;Muskrat Love&quot;. They hosted their own television variety series on ABC in 1976–77.

==History==

===Background and early collaboration===
In 1972, Toni Tennille was the co-writer of an ecology-themed musical, &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. At that time, Daryl Dragon (son of composer Carmen Dragon) played keyboards as a member of the Beach Boys, where he got his stage name &quot;Captain Keyboard&quot; because he wore a ship captain&#x27;s hat while performing. When Tennille&#x27;s show was preparing to move from San Francisco&#x27;s Marines Memorial Theatre to Southern California&#x27;s South Coast Repertory, a call was put out for a replacement keyboardist. Dragon was between tours when he heard about the opening, met Tennille in San Francisco to audition, and landed the gig.

Dragon later reciprocated by recommending Tennille to the Beach Boys when the band needed an additional keyboardist, and they hired her. She toured with them for a year, and has since been known as the Beach Boys&#x27; one and only &quot;Beach Girl.&quot;

Realizing their collaborative potential when the tour was over, Tennille and Dragon began performing as a duo, The Dragons, at the Smokehouse Restaurant in Encino, California. They started to become popular in the Los Angeles area and, borrowing on Daryl&#x27;s Beach Boys nickname, renamed their act to the more dynamic Captain &amp; Tennille. Their early version of the Tennille-penned &quot;The Way I Want to Touch You&quot; became popular on a local radio station which led to several offers from a number of record companies. They ultimately decided to sign a recording contract with A&amp;M Records.

===Mainstream success===

Their first hit single, a rendition of Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot;, reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart nine weeks after its 1975 debut, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a Gold disc by the RIAA on July 1, 1975. Tennille paid tribute to Sedaka in the recording when she sang the overdub &quot;Sedaka is back&quot; at the outro. The duo successfully mined the Sedaka songbook a number of times over their career. Two of their other hit singles were the Sedaka co-writes &quot;Lonely Night (Angel Face)&quot; and &quot;You Never Done It Like That&quot;. Their Spanish recording of &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot;, &quot;Por Amor Viviremos&quot;, also charted in 1975; it was the first time two versions of the same single charted simultaneously. Tennille and Dragon included renditions of several other Sedaka songs on their albums.

Tennille and Dragon married on November 11, 1975. A wedding date of Valentine&#x27;s Day 1974 had long been erroneously reported: On their television variety show, Tennille claimed they were married on Valentine&#x27;s Day, as did the February 14, 1976, edition of Casey Kasem&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot; radio show.

Over the next few years, Captain &amp; Tennille released a string of hit singles mostly from their first two albums &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; (US #2, 1975) and &quot;Song Of Joy&quot; (US #9, 1976) including &quot;The Way I Want to Touch You&quot; (US #4), &quot;Lonely Night (Angel Face)&quot; (US #3), &quot;Shop Around&quot; (US #4), and &quot;Muskrat Love&quot; (US #4).
In July 1976, they were invited by First Lady Betty Ford to perform in the East Room of the White House in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and President Gerald Ford during the country&#x27;s bicentennial celebration.

Such was the level of their popularity that they were given their own television variety show. &quot;The Captain and Tennille&quot; TV show aired from September 1976 to March 1977 on ABC. It featured musical numbers and comedy sketches performed with various guest stars. The show finished in the Nielsen ratings tied at 41 for the 1976-77 season with &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;. Despite decent ratings, it ranked #19 among the network&#x27;s shows and was canceled by ABC. Other, lower ranking shows on the network were renewed.The cancellation likely was the result of the duo&#x27;s desire to get out of their contract to focus on their music career.

The duo&#x27;s third album &quot;Come in from the Rain&quot; (US #18, 1977) produced three singles: &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; (US #13), the title track (US #61), and &quot;Circles&quot;, which did not chart. A&amp;M Records later released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album (1977) which peaked at #55 on the US Top 200.

The duo released their fourth studio album &quot;Dream&quot; (US #131, 1978), although their first single &quot;I&#x27;m on My Way&quot; (US #74) failed to become a hit. However, their second single, and third Sedaka title, &quot;You Never Done It Like That,&quot; fared much better at #10. A third single was &quot;You Need a Woman Tonight&quot; (US #40). &quot;Dream&quot; would be the last Captain and Tennille studio album released by A&amp;M.

In 1979, Neil Bogart signed them to a contract on his Casablanca Records label. The album &quot;Make Your Move&quot; (US #23, 1979) rose much higher on the chart than the act&#x27;s previous release, and the first single &quot;Do That to Me One More Time&quot; reached the summit on February 16, 1980, becoming their second #1 single. However, subsequent singles &quot;Love on a Shoestring&quot; (US #55) and &quot;Happy Together (A Fantasy)&quot; (US #53) only achieved minimal success.

&quot;Keeping Our Love Warm&quot; (1980) was the duo&#x27;s second Casablanca release, and sixth studio album overall, but failed to crack the Top 200. The first single from this album, the title track, was performed live (although lip synced) during the 1980 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

===Later career===

Throughout the 1990s, they continued to perform various concert dates at venues around the world, frequently at Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe and Harrah&#x27;s Reno, which were located close to their home near Carson City, Nevada. One of their more notable appearances in that decade occurred when they played at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in 1995, as part of their 20th anniversary as an act.

In 1999, on Cartoon Network, the duo made a guest appearance, interviewed by Harvey Birdman, rather than Space Ghost (who is sent to jail and breaks out) in an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

In 2000 Captain &amp; Tennille were to have embarked on a 25th anniversary tour; however, the stresses of the road proved too demanding and Captain &amp; Tennille instead put an indefinite hold on their career as a performing duo. Nevertheless, Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s popularity remained evident in the release of their &quot;Ultimate Collection: The Complete Hits&quot; on Hip-O Records (a subsidiary of Universal Records) in 2001, and &quot;More Than Dancing... Much More&quot;, a 2002 compact disc. The latter contains what was originally their final album in 1982, &quot;More Than Dancing&quot;, which at that time was released only in Australia, and is combined with selected tracks from their 1995 &quot;20 Years of Romance&quot;, originally on K-Tel (re-recording of their songs, and cover versions of others), as well as five newly released tracks.

In November 2003, Tennille performed a benefit concert for the Reno, Nevada Chamber Orchestra, where her surprise guest was Dragon. It was the first time they had publicly performed as Captain &amp; Tennille in many years. Their first live recording, &quot;An Intimate Evening with Toni Tennille&quot;, was released to commemorate the event. The same year, Tennille&#x27;s voice returned to the UK airwaves and to club play when the band Bent sampled a small portion of her vocals from Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s 1979 track, &quot;Love on a Shoestring&quot; (from the album &quot;Make Your Move&quot;), into their &quot;Magic Love&quot; single. An Ashley Beedle remix of the single heightened the danceability of the original ambient track.

In 2005, Brant Berry, the vice president of a small Portland, Oregon–based entertainment company, Respond 2 Entertainment (R2), signed an agreement with Captain &amp; Tennille to release three projects. The first was the home video release of Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s 1976 television variety series, on a three-disc DVD set containing 11 complete episodes with bonus musical tracks. Second, R2 re-released newly remastered CDs of all six of the duo&#x27;s studio albums, both from the original A&amp;M and Casablanca labels. Several of the CDs were previously available only in Japan. The new CDs, packaged both as individual CDs and in a box set, contained new liner notes written by Tennille. 

The third R2 project was the release of a new recording by Captain &amp; Tennille–a three-song Christmas CD entitled &quot;Saving Up Christmas&quot;. This effort was followed by &quot;The Secret of Christmas&quot;, Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s first complete original album produced in more than a decade, and their first-ever Christmas album. Released on Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s own label, Purebred Records, on November 1, 2007, it would also become the duo&#x27;s final studio album.

In October 2006, Cartoon Network&#x27;s animated special &quot;Casper&#x27;s Scare School&quot; was aired. The duo recorded two songs for the film, and voiced the dialog for the characters who sang the songs. Tennille portrayed Aunt Belle and the Captain was Uncle Murray, who together formed a two-head-on-one-body being known as the Ankle. The two songs they performed, &quot;Why Does Love Make Me Feel So Good&quot; and &quot;World Without Fear,&quot; were written by Magnus Fiennes. Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s co-stars on the show included Phyllis Diller, James Belushi, Dan Castellaneta, and Bob Saget.

In 2007, three new DVDs were released of Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s ABC TV specials: &quot;Captain &amp; Tennille in Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Captain &amp; Tennille in New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;Captain &amp; Tennille Songbook&quot;.

==Personal lives==
Dragon and Tennille spent most of the 1990s and 2000s living in the Carson City area of Nevada, where they had lived for more than fifteen years, and where Tennille served as Ambassador for the Arts for the state. In the mid-2000s, they temporarily took year-round residence at their second home, located in the Palm Springs area of Southern California. In 2008, they sold their home near Carson City, and built a house in Prescott, Arizona, where Tennille participates in the annual Prescott Jazz Summit.

Tennille filed for divorce from Dragon in the State of Arizona on January 16, 2014, after 39 years of marriage. Dragon was unaware of the termination of his marriage until he was served with the divorce papers. The divorce documents referenced health insurance or health issues, and Tennille had written in her blog in 2010 that Dragon&#x27;s neurological condition, known as essential tremor, was characterized by such extreme tremors that he could no longer play keyboards. Dragon later stated that some of his health problems were the result of errors in dosing his medication.

In 2016, &quot;Toni Tennille&quot;, Tennille&#x27;s memoir (co-written with niece Caroline Tennille St. Clair), was published. In it, Tennille painted an unflattering picture of Dragon and their years together, writing that he was controlling and emotionally distant. &quot;I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,&quot; she wrote, claiming that the couple always slept in separate bedrooms.

Dragon and Tennille remained close friends until his death from complications of kidney failure on January 2, 2019, in Prescott, Arizona. Tennille was at his side when he died.

<doc id="551261" wikidata="Q325038" url="?curid=551261" title="Vasily Kuznetsov (politician)">
<text>Vasily Vasilyevich Kuznetsov (; 5 June 1990) was a Russian Soviet politician who acted as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1983 (after the death of Brezhnev), for a second time in 1984 (after the death of Andropov), and for a third time in 1985 (after the death of Chernenko). He was one of the oldest members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was formally the highest state post. During the term of office, Kuznetsov was 81–82, 82–83, and 84 years old, respectively. He is the oldest head of the Soviet and Russian state in history (he was older than all three predecessors in this post).

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Kuznetsov was born on February, 13 O.S. 31 January] 1901, in the village of Sofilovka, Ovsyanovsky volost, Varnavinsky district, Kostroma province. Vasily&#x27;s father, Vasily Mikhailov Kuznetsov, was a peasant, the head of a large, poor family. In 1915, He graduated from a rural school and immediately entered a pedagogical school in the village of Poretskoye, Chuvash Republic (then in Simbirsk Governorate). He studied at the school until 1919. With the beginning of the Civil War, he ended up in the ranks of the Red Army, until 1921. After the end of the war, he entered the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, which he graduated in 1926. In the same year, he went to the Donbas, got a job as a research engineer at the Makeevsky Metallurgical Plant. Soon he was appointed shift engineer, then deputy chief. In 1930, he was the head of a open-hearth shop.

=== Party career ===

He joined the CPSU in May 1927. In 1931, Kuznetsov was among the workers of the Makeevka plant who went on an internship in the United States, at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1936, he moved from Makeevka to the Moscow region, got a job at the Elektrostal plant as head of the metallographic laboratory. In September 1937, he began to rise to the highest echelons of power: Vasily began working in the apparatus of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Heavy Industry of the USSR. In 1946, he became chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet and a Deputy of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet. He held the position until March 1953, at the same time being a member of the Organizing Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks. In 1953, he went to work at the USSR Foreign Ministry, for some time he headed the Soviet embassy in China. In 1955, he became the first deputy minister of foreign affairs of the USSR. After the head of the USSR Foreign Ministry Dmitry Shipilov was transferred to the secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPSU, He became one of the main candidates for the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, Andrei Gromyko takes the position. Kuznetsov made an invaluable contribution to the settlement of the Caribbean crisis. As an official representative of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Kuznetsov repeatedly met with the Americans, explaining to them the position of the USSR, in every possible way preventing a nuclear war. Another major achievement of Kuznetsov is the establishment of negotiations with China after the bloody clash on Damansky Island, which threatened to escalate into a full-scale war. He was the head of the Soviet delegation at the negotiations with the PRC on the demarcation of the border. In 1971, he was awarded the Hero of the Socialist Labor after his 70th birthday. Kuznetsov was engaged in the settlement of the Indo-Pakistani crisis, his diplomatic activity at least temporarily helped to avoid deepening the bloody conflict.

In 1977, Kuznetsov became the first deputy chairman of the Presidium of the USSR. On 10 November, 1982, after the death of Brezhnev, Kuznetsov became the acting Chairman of the Presidium of the USSR until on 16 June, 1983, he was succeeded by Yuri Andropov. 

Andropov was the head of the USSR for a short time – on 9 February, 1984, he died at the age of 69. Kuznetsov succeeded Andropov in 9 February to 11 April, 1984, Chernenko takes the position. Kuznetsov headed the USSR on 10 March, 1985 after the death of Chernenko. On 27 July, 1985, Gromyko was chosen by the Central Committee and succeeded Kuznetsov.

== Later life and Death ==
He decided to retire in June 1986 and died of natural causes on 5 June, 1990, at the age of 89. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery next to his wife. For a long time, Kuznetsov retained the title of the longest-lived Head of State of the USSR, but in 2021 the record was broken by Mikhail Gorbachev.
==Awards==
During his lifetime as a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he had received several high awards and medals, including the Hero of the Socialist Labour twice.

<doc id="551269" wikidata="Q116872" url="?curid=551269" title="Rímur">
<text>In Icelandic literature, a ríma (, literally &quot;a rhyme&quot;, pl. rímur, ) is an epic poem written in any of the so-called rímnahættir (, &quot;rímur meters&quot;). They are rhymed, they alliterate and consist of two to four lines per stanza. The plural, &quot;rímur&quot;, is either used as an ordinary plural, denoting any two or more rímur, but is also used for more expansive works, containing more than one ríma as a whole. Thus &quot;Ólafs ríma Haraldssonar&quot; denotes an epic about Ólafr Haraldsson in one ríma, while &quot;Núma rímur&quot; are a multi-part epic on Numa Pompilius.

==Form==

&quot;Rímur&quot;, as the name suggests, rhyme, but like older Germanic alliterative verse, they also contain structural alliteration. &quot;Rímur&quot; are stanzaic, and stanzas normally have four lines. There are hundreds of &quot;ríma&quot; meters: Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson counts 450 variations in his &quot;Háttatal&quot;. But they can be grouped in approximately ten &quot;families&quot;. The most common metre is &quot;ferskeytt&quot;.

&quot;Ríma&quot;-poetry inherited kennings, heiti and other ornate features of medieval Icelandic poetic diction from skaldic verse. The language of &quot;rímur&quot; is likewise influenced by the rhetorical devices associated with late medieval &quot;geblümter Stil&quot; (&#x27;flowery style&#x27;).

When they are long — as they usually are — &quot;rímur&quot; usually comprise several distinct sections, each being called a &quot;ríma&quot;, and each usually in a different metre. After the earliest &quot;rímur&quot;, it became conventional to begin each &quot;ríma&quot; in a cycle with a &quot;mansöngr&quot;, a lyric address, traditionally to or about a woman whom the poet supposedly loves, usually in vain.

==History==

The earliest &quot;rímur&quot; date from the fourteenth century, evolving from eddaic poetry and skaldic poetry with influences from Continental epic poems. &quot;Óláfs ríma Haraldssonar&quot;, preserved in &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, is the &quot;ríma&quot; attested in the oldest manuscript and is sometimes considered the oldest &quot;ríma&quot;; the earliest large collection of &quot;rímur&quot; is in Kollsbók, dated by Ólafur Halldórsson to 1480–90. &quot;Skíðaríma&quot;, &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot;, and &quot;Lokrur&quot; are other examples of early &quot;rímur&quot;. The key work on editing &quot;rímur&quot; focused on medieval examples like these and was undertaken by Finnur Jónsson. &quot;Rímur&quot; were usually adapted from existing prose sagas, and occasionally comprise the only surviving evidence for those sagas. One example of such a &quot;rímur&quot; is the fifteenth-century &quot;Skáld-Helga rímur&quot;.

&quot;Rímur&quot; were the mainstay of epic poetry in Iceland for centuries: 78 are known from before 1600, 138 from the seventeenth century, 248 from the eighteenth, 505 from the nineteenth and 75 from the twentieth. Most have never been printed and survive only in manuscripts, mostly in the National and University Library of Iceland: about one hundred and thirty popular editions of rímur were printed between 1800 and 1920, but there are more than one thousand nineteenth-century manuscripts containing &quot;rímur&quot;. In the large majority of cases the &quot;rímur&quot; cycles were composed on a subject about which a written story already existed. As a twist of fate, quite a number of now lost sagas now survive in the form of rímur composed based on them, and then the sagas were recomposed based on the corresponding rímur.

The twenty-first century has seen something of a revival of &quot;rímur&quot; in Icelandic popular music. The central figure in this revival has been Steindór Andersen, particularly noted for collaborations Sigur Rós (leading to the 2001 EP &quot;Rímur&quot;) and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (leading, for example, to the 2013 album &quot;Stafnbúi&quot;).

==Critical reception==

In the nineteenth century the poet Jónas Hallgrímsson published an influential critique on a rímur cycle by Sigurður Breiðfjörð and the genre as a whole. At the same time Jónas and other romantic poets were introducing new continental verse forms into Icelandic literature and the popularity of the &quot;rímur&quot; started to decline. Nevertheless, many of the most popular nineteenth- and twentieth-century Icelandic poets composed &quot;rímur&quot;, including Bólu-Hjálmar, Sigurður Breiðfjörð, Einar Benediktsson, Steinn Steinarr, Örn Arnarson and Þórarinn Eldjárn. In the late twentieth century Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson was the best known &quot;rímur&quot; poet. Steindór Andersen is currently the leading &quot;rímur&quot; singer in Iceland: he often collaborates with the band Sigur Rós and has also contributed to some of Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson&#x27;s works.

The scholar Sigurður Nordal wrote on the &quot;rímur&quot;.

Through the ages numerous authors would probably have agreed with this statement, since there is a substantial number of rímur that were turned into prose sagas. However, it is worth mentioning that Nordal never denied the importance of rímur as an aspect of the history of literature, and in his lectures specifically emphasized their role in keeping the continuity of Icelandic literature, a subject close to his heart. He also recognized that among the mass of rímur composed, there were works of art to be found, although he was of the opinion that (according to his published lectures) none of the rímur might be called a &quot;perfect work of art&quot; with the possible exception of &quot;Skíðaríma&quot;. But a &quot;perfect work of art&quot; is somewhat hard to achieve.

<text>British Thomson-Houston (BTH) was a British engineering and heavy industrial company, based at Rugby, Warwickshire, England. Originally founded to sell products from the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, it soon became a manufacturer using licences from the American company. They were known primarily for their electrical systems and steam turbines.

BTH merged with the Metropolitan-Vickers company in 1928 to form Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), but the two brand identities were maintained until 1960. The holding company, AEI, was bought by GEC in 1967.

In the 1960s AEI&#x27;s apprenticeships were highly thought-of, both by the apprentices themselves and by their future employers, because they gave the participants valuable experience in the design, production and overall industrial management of a very wide range of electrical products. Over a hundred of the apprentices - who came to Rugby from all over the UK, and a few from abroad - lodged in the nearby Apprentices&#x27; Hostel at Coton House which was uphill from Rugby on the road to Lutterworth and Leicester.

Each year in Rugby there was a big parade of floats run by the apprentices.

In 1980, G.E.C. Turbine Generators Ltd, on the Rugby site, was awarded a Queen&#x27;s Awards for Enterprise.

==History==


The company Laing, Wharton and Down was formed in 1886 to sell products from the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. Laing, Wharton and Down soon won a contract for electrical lighting for the east end of London.

In 1894 Laing, Wharton and Down purchased patents and exclusive production rights from the American company, now known as General Electric after Thomson-Houston merged with Edison General Electric Company in 1892. At this stage Laing, Wharton and Down was renamed as British Thomson-Houston and General Electric became the majority owner of the company.

Once BTH had the production licences for Thomson-Houston&#x27;s products it started setting up factories in the English Midlands, with Rugby, Warwickshire chosen as the main location due to its good accessibility by rail and a local coal supply. In 1900 BTH bought Glebe Farm on the west side of Mill Road north of the railway in Rugby for £10,000, from Thos. Hunter &amp; Co., to build their factory on it. The Mill Road factory opened in 1902 and made electric motors and generators. In the same year BTH obtained a licence to produce the Curtis steam turbine, which became one of the company&#x27;s major products. In 1905 BTH made its first turbo-alternator and in 1911 got licences for all of General Electric&#x27;s drawn-wire light bulbs, which it produced under the Mazda trademark.

For much of the late 19th century BTH competed for electrical generation and distribution contracts with British Westinghouse, mirroring the same company&#x27;s battles in the US between their parents, General Electric and Westinghouse. The Power Act 1900 let BTH and British Westinghouse get new contracts to supply electric power to large areas.

As well as manufacturing, BTH also began to move into transport. On 22 December 1898 BTH opened the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company, followed by the Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways on 4 April 1901 and the Chatham and District Light Railways Company in June 1902. In 1903 BTH was contracted to supply the electrical equipment for the Tyneside Electrics railway network in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1907 BTH started a joint venture with Wolseley Motors to make petrol-electric buses and in 1909 the company supplied major coal-fired steam generators to London to power an electric trolley system that was being set up.

===Consolidation===

During World War I BTH expanded into naval electrical equipment, supplying the Royal Navy with various lighting, radio and signalling gear.

After the war BTH expanded dramatically, adding or expanding factories at Willesden, Birmingham, Chesterfield, and Lutterworth. It later had factories in Coventry, and in Larne in Northern Ireland. From 1924 to 1927 Demetrius Comino worked as an apprentice for BTH.

In 1926 Gerard Swope, president of General Electric, proposed that BTH, Westinghouse, General Electric Company (GEC) and English Electric should amalgamate. Lord Hirst of GEC was not interested in Swope&#x27;s scheme, but a new holding company was formed, Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), and in 1928 AEI bought BTH and Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick). BTH had been in the process of buying Edison Swan (Ediswan) and Ferguson, Pailin &amp; Co, with AEI completing the purchases in 1929. Howard C. Levis, chairman of BTH from 1916, became chairman of AEI in 1928, retiring the following year.

In 1927 BTH sold the Chatham and District Light Railways Company to Maidstone and District Motor Services Ltd.

Throughout the 1920s BTH made turbo generators and motors for ocean liners including , , and . The BTH factory in Northern Ireland made the turbo generator and propulsion motor for one of the world&#x27;s first turbo-electric merchant ships, the banana boat SS &quot;San Benito&quot;, in 1921. This was followed by turbo generators and propulsion motors for the banana boats , and .

The site at Rugby was also developed. Building 52, the research laboratory, was purpose-built in 1924. In the late 1920s AEI started to build buildings west of the footpath that runs north through the AEI site in Rugby to the Leicester Road, known in the area as the Black Path because it was surfaced with cinders, clinker and bitumen. During World War II BTH expanded north of the River Avon into the Boughton Road site to make magnetos for aircraft engines and other war products.
BTH had a major role in developing the world&#x27;s first prototype jet engine, which was built by Frank Whittle&#x27;s Power Jets company at the BTH works in Rugby in 1937. Development was later moved to the Lutterworth works, which were falling into disuse at the time. BTH&#x27;s directors seemed sceptical of the design and offered little help, and in 1940 decided they were not really interested in making jet engines due to their commitment to electrical equipment. Rover was soon selected to make jet engines, but exchanged jet engine production with Rolls-Royce for making tank engines in 1943. In 1944 the Lutterworth Power Jets work was nationalised.

After World War II Oliver Lyttelton took over as chairman of AEI, and started a massive expansion. He returned as chairman between 1954 and 1963 and oversaw the opening of a massive new £8 million turbine works was opened at Larne in 1957. In 1955 AEI acquired Siemens Brothers, which was merged with Edison Swan in 1957 to form the Siemens Edison Swan subsidiary. Rivalry with Metrovick intensified, particularly after BTH won the contract to build the new Buenos Aires Central Costanera S.A. power station, valued at £35 million, in 1957. Lyttelton continued to try to reduce this friction, leading to several unsuccessful reorganisations and slipping profits.

The postwar period saw continued development at BTH. The Hungarian scientist Dennis Gabor invented holography at the BTH site in Rugby in 1947, and in 1951 BTH supplied a gas turbine for the &quot;Auris&quot;, the first commercial ship to use gas-turbine propulsion. In 1955 BTH supplied 18 New Zealand DSC class locomotive Rolls-Royce powered locomotives for New Zealand Railways. The Ediswan trademark appeared on semiconductors in 1956 and the following year British Rail Class 15 diesel-electric locomotives were designed by BTH.

===AEI (Associated Electrical Industries)===
To try to cure internal political and efficiency problems, AEI stopped using the BTH and Metrovick names on 1 January 1960. This led to a huge decline in sales because no-one had heard of &quot;AEI&quot; before, and in turn, a massive drop in AEI&#x27;s stock price. Continued attempts to streamline what was two separate management structures continued to fail, and by the mid-60s the entire AEI group was in financial trouble. The AEI name was first used on products in 1961. By 1967 AEI brands included Siemens Edison Swan, Hotpoint, Birlec and W.T. Henley.

The AEI research lab (building BR57) was built in 1960 at the Boughton Road site. At this point the size of the Rugby site peaked, with all of the company&#x27;s land west of the Black Path built over.

Britain&#x27;s first commercial nuclear power facility was built between 1956 and 1962 at Berkeley. This was followed by the building and commissioning of the 25 m Chilbolton radar dish at Chilbolton Observatory between 1963 and 1967.

===GEC (General Electric Company)===

In 1967 GEC bought AEI outright and became the UK&#x27;s largest electrical group. A year later GEC acquired English Electric, prompting a series of mergers and reorganisations. GEC-AEI Electronics (Blackbird Road and New Parks, Leicester) was merged with Marconi&#x27;s Radar Division (Chelmsford) and Elliott&#x27;s Aerospace Control Division to form Marconi Radar Systems Ltd. (MRSL) in 1969.

In 1980 GEC Turbine Generators Ltd received The Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise: International Trade (Export).

During the 1980s GEC Rugby shrank and buildings were demolished. The south part of the area to the west of the Black Path became a supermarket site. The Boughton Road site became several separate small firms. In 1989 GEC Rugby split into GEC Alsthom and Cegelec Projects, which were reunited in 1998 as Alstom.

The firm&#x27;s on Hillmorton Road was demolished in 2007, and the south edge of its surrounding sports field was encroached along for house building.

By 2011 the Mill Road factory site was greatly changed and included Rugby College. Quartzelec, and Converteam worked on electrical engineering projects in some of the early BTH buildings, notably buildings 4, 193 and 140. A public road was built through the site between its former east and west gates. In 2012 Converteam was bought out by General Electric, therefore coming full circle back to when they were partnered in AEI. Converteam (now GE) produced rotating machines and used former-BTH equipment (machines) for running tests.

==Research==
During post-World War II Britain, AEI established a consolidated research effort at Aldermaston in Berkshire, England. The research centre was based at Aldermaston Court, a large stately home owned by AEI that had been requisitioned for military use in the war era.

==Preserved locomotives==
One of the BTH-built batch of New Zealand Railways DSC class Bo-Bo shunters has been preserved and is used in industrial service, complete with original Rolls-Royce engines. The locomotive (DSC406) is the primary motive power at Alliance Ltd, Pukeuri, New Zealand. All the others were scrapped between 1986 and 1990.

Metro-Cammell-BTH diesel electric locomotive 4102 has been preserved in New South Wales, Australia.

Another BTH diesel locomotive is preserved in the UK This locomotive was purchased from Ford Dagenham by AEI and presented to the Kent and East Sussex Railway for preservation. See Rolling stock of the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway (heritage) for details.

<text>The former Central Police Station of Hong Kong is located at the eastern end of Hollywood Road, in Central, Hong Kong. It has been redeveloped into a cultural and shopping destination generally called Tai Kwun (). Tai Kwun is composed of three declared monuments: the former Central Police Station, former Central Magistracy and Victoria Prison.

==History==

The oldest structure within the police station was built in 1864; a three-storey barrack block constructed adjacent to Victoria Prison. A storey was later added to the block in 1905. Other blocks were added between 1910 and 1925. In 1919, Headquarters Block facing Hollywood Road was constructed. Subsequently, in 1925, the two-storey Stable Block was constructed at the north-west end of the parade ground and later used as an armoury.

Many police stations were built during this period due to the large number of people who moved to Hong Kong from mainland China and the corresponding need to maintain law and order.

In the afternoon of 15 December 1941, during the Battle of Hong Kong, a stick Japanese bombs hit the junction of Old Bailey Street and Caine Road, the junction of Pottinger Street and Hollywood Road, Wellington Street and the Central Police Station. The ground floor and the basement offices of Police Headquarters were destroyed, causing casualties. The bombing was part of a systematic bombardment of the Hong Kong Island&#x27;s north shore that was launched on that day.

In the past, the police station was used as the headquarters of the police; however, its importance declined when the new police headquarters was built in Wan Chai after World War II. It functioned as a police station, dormitory, and prison, and was used as both the Hong Kong Island Regional Police Headquarters and the Central District Police Headquarters until the 2000s.

==Buildings==
The former Central Police Station comprises seven buildings:

The compound is bordered on the North by Hollywood Road, on the South by Chancery Lane, on the East by Arbuthnot Road and on the West by Old Bailey Street.

==Conservation status==

With its long history and antiquated architectural style, the Central Police Station is one of the last physical reminders of Hong Kong&#x27;s colonial heritage.

The Central Police Station has undergone reconstruction to convert it and the former Central Magistracy to more public use; including food outlets, museums, and art galleries. By adaptive reuse, the renovated police station compound is intended to become a tourist destination with historical significance, a rarity amongst Hong Kong attractions. The restoration work was conducted by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which now manages the facility.

The former Central Police Station, the Victoria Prison, and the former Central Magistracy are declared monuments of Hong Kong. These buildings are collectively referred to as &quot;Tai Kwun&quot;.

The restored facility reopened in May 2018.

In 2019, the revitalised and rebranded building Tai Kwun won the Award of Excellence of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation.

==Revitalisation==
Suggested by property developer Swire Properties in 1999, the Economic Development and Labour Bureau called for private sector bidding to convert the building compound into a retail and entertainment complex in 2003. The proposal of commercial project received heavy public criticism. Many compared the initiative with the controversial revitalization of the former Marine Police Headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui. The plan was eventually shelved in 2004.

On 20 October 2010, Hong Kong Jockey Club announced that a heritage-led plan to conserve and revitalise the CPS and transform it into a centre of heritage, arts and leisure. The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust agreed to provide the capital cost of the revitalisation of the CPS. As a not-for-profit organisation, the Trust does not expect an investment return.

Herzog &amp; de Meuron, Purcell and Rocco Design collaborated and examined many different alternative schemes in order to establish the best design for adaptive re-use. Given the physical constraints of the site, two new buildings have been added: the &quot;Old Bailey Galleries&quot;, and &quot;Arbuthnot Auditorium&quot;.

In addition to the existing public entrance at Pottinger Gate, an Old Bailey Gate, an Arbuthnot Gate, and a footbridge connection to the Mid-Levels Escalator have been constructed to allow access to the site. Stairs and lifts facilitate pedestrian connectivity between the upper courtyard near Chancery Lane and lower courtyard near Hollywood Road, and between SoHo and Lan Kwai Fong.

In 2016, during the ongoing revitalisation, part of the married inspectors&#x27; quarters, which was built in 1864, collapsed; nobody was injured.

The site was opened by Carrie Lam, Hong Kong&#x27;s Chief Executive, on 25 May 2018 In her opening speech, Ms Lam praised the work of the design architect Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the conservation expert Michael Morrison, the executive architect Rocco Design Architects, and the Project Director Mike Moir.

<doc id="551284" wikidata="Q430416" url="?curid=551284" title="Cauliflower mosaic virus">
<text>Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a member of the genus &quot;Caulimovirus&quot;, one of the six genera in the family &quot;Caulimoviridae&quot;, which are pararetroviruses that infect plants. Pararetroviruses replicate through reverse transcription just like retroviruses, but the viral particles contain DNA instead of RNA.

== Definition==

The cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a member of the family &quot;Caulimoviridae&quot;. This family is grouped together with the &quot;Belpaoviridae&quot;, &quot;Metaviridae&quot;, &quot;Pseudoviridae&quot;, and &quot;Retroviridae&quot; (all of which instead have an RNA genome replicated via a DNA intermediate) in the order &quot;Ortervirales&quot;; the &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot;, despite having a DNA genome replicated via an RNA intermediate (like the &quot;Caulimoviridae&quot;), are more distantly related, belonging to the separate order &quot;Blubervirales&quot; (both orders belong to the same class, the &quot;Revtraviricetes&quot;).
CaMV infects mostly plants of the family Brassicaceae (such as cauliflower and turnip) but some CaMV strains (D4 and W260) are also able to infect Solanaceae species of the genera &quot;Datura&quot; and &quot;Nicotiana&quot;. CaMV induces a variety of systemic symptoms such as mosaic, necrotic lesions on leaf surfaces, stunted growth, and deformation of the overall plant structure. The symptoms exhibited vary depending on the viral strain, host ecotype, and environmental conditions.
CaMV is transmitted in a non-circulatory manner by aphid species such as &quot;Myzus persicae&quot;. Once introduced within a plant host cell, virions migrate to the nuclear envelope of the plant cell.

== Structure ==
The CaMV particle is an icosahedron with a diameter of 52 nm built from 420 capsid protein (CP) subunits arranged with a triangulation T = 7, which surrounds a solvent-filled central cavity.

CaMV contains a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of about 8.0 kilobases, interrupted by nicks that result from the actions of RNAse H during reverse transcription. These nicks come from the Met-tRNA, and two RNA primers used in reverse transcription. After entering the host cell, these single stranded &quot;nicks&quot; in the viral DNA are repaired, forming a supercoiled molecule that binds to histones. This DNA is transcribed into a full length, &quot;Terminally redundant&quot;, 35S RNA and a subgenomic 19S RNA.

== Genome ==
The promoter of the 35S RNA is a very strong constitutive promoter responsible for the transcription of the whole CaMV genome. It is well known for its use in plant transformation. It causes high levels of gene expression in dicot plants. However, it is less effective in monocots, especially in cereals. The differences in behavior are probably due to differences in quality and/or quantity of regulatory factors. Recent study has indicated that the CaMV 35S promoter is also functional in some animal cells, although the promoter elements used are different from those in plants. While this promoter had low activity compared to canonical animal promoters, levels of reporter products were significant. This observation suggests that the 35S promoter may have potential for use in animals.
The promoter was named CaMV 35S promoter (&quot;35S promoter&quot;) because the coefficient of sedimentation of the viral transcript, whose expression is naturally driven by this promoter, is 35S. It is one of the most widely used, general-purpose constitutive promoters. It was discovered at the beginning of the 1980s, by Chua and collaborators at The Rockefeller University.
The 35S RNA is particularly complex, containing a highly structured 600 nucleotide long leader sequence with six to eight short open reading frames (ORFs).

This leader is followed by seven tightly arranged, longer ORFs that encode all the viral proteins. The mechanism of expression of these proteins is unique, in that the ORF VI protein (encoded by the 19S RNA) controls translation reinitiation of major open reading frames on the polycistronic 35S RNA, a process that normally only happens on bacterial mRNAs. TAV function depends on its association with polysomes and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3.
*ORF I – P1: movement protein ()
*ORF II – P2: aphid/insect transmission factor ()
*ORF III – P3: virion-associated protein (VAP, ): structural protein, DNA-binding capabilities
*ORF IV – P4: capsid protein (CP, )
*ORF V – P5: pro-pol (): protease, bifunctional reverse transcriptase and RNaseH
*ORF VI – P6: transactivator/viroplasmin (): inclusion body Formation/trafficking; possibly other functions (see text)
*ORF VII/VIII – unknown (appears note to be required for infection, , )
** Contains a tRNA-Met binding site

In addition to its functions regarding translational activation and formation of inclusion bodies, P6 has been shown to interact with a number of other CaMV proteins, such as P2 and P3, suggesting that it may also contribute in some degree to viral assembly and aphid-mediated transmission. In addition, P6 has been shown to bind to P7; investigating interactions between the two may help to elucidate the as yet unknown function of P7.

Another function of P6 involves modification of host NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1 (NPR1) during the course of infection. NPR1 is an important regulator of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent signaling, and is most closely associated with crosstalk between the two. Modification of NPR1 serves to inhibit plant cells’ defensive responses by preventing SA-dependent signaling; modified NPR1 can properly traffic to the nucleus and bind the PR-1 promoter, but is unable to initiate transcription. Because active NPR1 is required for accumulation of SA, this leads to a further depletion of SA. Whereas regulation of SA-dependent signaling by P6-modified NPR1 is localized to the nucleus, regulation of JA-dependent signaling is cytoplasmic in nature and involves the COI1 pathway. In contrast to that of SA, JA-dependent signaling is increased in the presence of modified NPR1.

==Replication==

CaMV replicates by reverse transcription:
#Viral particles enter a plant cell and are unencapsidated. At this stage the viral DNA consists of three fragments, one on the – strand (α) and two on the + strand (β and γ) which are imperfectly assembled into a circular genome with three gaps or discontinuities (D1, D2, and D3).
#The viral DNA enters the nucleus where the discontinuities are filled in. At this point the viral DNA also associates with host histones, forming a minichromosome (not shown).
#The host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes from the 35S promoter all the way around the viral genome, surpassing the 35S promoter. (This creates two copies of the 35S promoter in the resulting RNA.) Transcription also initiates at the 19S promoter (not shown).
#The viral RNAs pass into the host cytoplasm where they are transcribed.
#The 3′ end of a tRNAfMet anneals to a site corresponding to discontinuity 1 (D1) near the 5′ end of the 35S RNA.
#The tRNAfMet primes synthesis, by the viral reverse transcriptase (encoded by ORF V), of a new α strand.
#RNase H removes the RNA from the DNA–RNA duplex, leaving behind the DNA.
#This new DNA binds the 35S promoter at the 3′ end of the RNA template and synthesis of the α strand of DNA continues and RNase H continues to degrade RNA complexed to DNA.
#Synthesis of the α strand completes. RNase H activity exposes purine-rich regions at the position of discontinuity 3 (D3), which primes the synthesis of the γ DNA strand.
#RNase H activity exposes purine-rich regions at the position of discontinuity 2 (D2), which primes the synthesis of the β DNA strand. When the new γ strand of DNA reaches the 5′ end of the new α strand it switches to the 5′ end of the new α strand, recreating discontinuity 1 (D1). When the new γ strand of DNA reaches the 5′ end of the new β strand, it displaces the primer and some of the newly synthesized β strand, resulting in the recreation of discontinuity 2 (D2). When the new β strand of DNA reaches the 5′ end of the new γ strand, it displaces the primer and some of the newly synthesized γ strand, resulting in the recreation of discontinuity 3 (D3).
At this point the new viral genome can either be packaged into capsids and released from the cell or they can be transported by movement proteins into an adjacent, uninfected cell.
The cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV 35S) is used in most transgenic crops to activate foreign genes which have been artificially inserted into the host plant. It is inserted into transgenic plants in a form which is different from that found when it is present in its natural &quot;Brassica&quot; plant hosts. This enables it to operate in a wide range of host-organism environments which would otherwise not be possible.
CaMV contains about 8 kb double-strand DNA genome and produces spherical particles. CaMV infections are systemic, and even its DNA is infectious when inoculated on abraded plant surfaces. The CaMV genome has 8 tightly packed genes, of which only two small genes, genes II and VII, are nonessential; as a result, only these two genes can be replaced/deleted without a loss of infectivity. In addition, modified CaMV genomes exceeding the natural genome size (8024 bp) by even a few hundred bp are not packaged into virions. These two factors seriously limit the size of DNA insert clonable in CaMV. The bacterial dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene has been successfully cloned into the CaMV genome, in place of gene II, and has been successfully expressed in plants.

== Molecular mechanisms of vector-mediated CaMV transmission==
The virus is acquired from an infected host during feeding by the aphid vector. To occur, a transmissible complex is composed of virions and protein P2 located in the vector&#x27;s stylets. The P2 N-terminal domain recognizes a protein receptor located at the tip of the stylet and the P2 C-terminal domain binds to the P3-decorated virions.
The mode of acquisition by the vector is controlled by the tissue and intracellular-specific localization of P2. This protein is only found in epidermis and parenchyma cells. Moreover, in these cells, P2 is localized in single viral electron-lucent inclusion bodies (ELIB). In host cells, viral protein P2 and P3 are first produced in numerous viral factories (electron-dense inclusion bodies), and are later exported and co-localize with microtubules, before concentrating in ELIB. CaMV specifically uses the microtubules to form the transmissible body and thus enable vector transmission. The complete molecular characterization and study of this virus was not carried further.

==Evasion of plant defenses==
Cauliflower mosaic virus possesses a number of mechanisms that allow it to counteract host plant cell defenses. While the pregenomic 35S RNA is responsible for genome replication by reverse transcriptase, it also contains a non-coding 600 base pair leader sequence that serves as an important mRNA for the production of factors involved in viral counter-defense. A number of hosts of CaMV possess small RNA-based viral silencing mechanisms that serve to limit viral infection. The products of the aforementioned 600-bp sequence are viral small RNAs () of 21, 22, and 24 nucleotides in length that serve as decoys, binding and inactivating effectors of host silencing machinery, such as Argonaute 1 (AGO1). As proof-of-principle, experimental overexpression of these allows for increased viral accumulation in infected plants.

==Concerns about use of CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic plants==
In the early 2010s, some concerns have been raised about using the CaMV 35S promoter for expression in transgenic plants because sequence overlap exists between this promoter and the coding sequences of P6. Fifty four transgenic events certified for release in the USA contain up to 528 bp of ORF VI (encoding C-terminal domains of P6). As P6 is a multifunctional protein whose full range of functions is unknown, there is some concern that expression of one or more of its domains may have unforeseen consequences in the transgenic organisms. Recent studies have attempted to determine what length of CaMV 35S promoter has the least chance of inadvertently producing P6 domains, while still retaining full promoter activity. As one might expect, using shorter promoter lengths decreases the number of P6 domains included and also decreases the likelihood of unwanted effects.

==History==

=== 1935–1991: 3XY ===
====1935–1967 – Diverse programming====
3XY began broadcasting on 8 September 1935, the original licence being held by the inaugural United Australia Party (and later the Liberal Party). [Rival station 3KZ was licensed to the Industrial Printing Co. Ltd. for and on behalf of the Victorian Labor Party. However, from commencement, 3XY&#x27;s programs were provided by Efftee Broadcasters Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Efftee Studios, who were the first in Australia to produce sound films. Efftee was owned by Frank Thring Sr., father of internationally renowned actor Frank Thring Jr. 
Frank Thring Sr. died of cancer on 1 July 1936, and Efftee Studios and Efftee Broadcasters were inherited by his second wife, Olive. Nevertheless, Frank Thring Jr., who was only 10 year&#x27;s old when his father died, often referred to himself as the &quot;proprietor&quot;.

Tom Holt, the father of the future Prime Minister of Australia, Harold Holt. was in control of Efftee Studios at this time and Frank Thring Sr. appointed him as the first manager of 3XY. 3XY originally broadcast from studios in the former ballroom at the top of the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, but in the early 1960s, the station moved to purpose-built studios in Faraday Street, Carlton; this was the first of a number of subsequent relocations.

Like virtually all broadcasters prior to the introduction of television in Australia and the invention of the transistor radio, 3XY broadcast a variety of programming styles; theoretically providing something of appeal to all its prospective listeners. The station&#x27;s original slogan &quot;The Quality Station&quot; was taken seriously by management, who tried to produce programs which they often perceived as being superior to similar programs being produced by rival stations.

3XY was the last commercial radio station to come on air in Melbourne until 3MP began broadcasting in 1976, 41 years later. By the time 3XY began broadcasting in 1935, most listeners had established their broadcasting patterns and they often continued to listen to 3XY&#x27;s rivals, which is usually seen as the reason why 3XY was very low in the ratings for some decades. Despite generally low ratings, there were a few popular programs, including the children&#x27;s session sponsored by Peters Ice Cream, One Man&#x27;s Family, Raising a Husband, etc. The station also produced some top class live variety programs with artists of the calibre of Stella Lamond; Doug McKenzie; Helen Reddy, Max Reddy, Leslie Ross, etc.

Frank Thring Jr. started his career as both a thespian and radio announcer at 3XY in 1941, as a young man of 15. His numerous jobs at the 3XY microphone included being &quot;Uncle Frankie&quot; in the children&#x27;s session. Thring&#x27;s acting career, whilst mainly centred around the Melbourne theatre scene, also included periods in London and Hollywood.

The late Bert Newton grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy where he became a scout. His first broadcast in a radio, television and theatrical career that spanned nearly 60 years was in the 3XY program &quot;Scouting Around&quot;, hosted by Tom Jones. In the mid-1950s, Newton presented the 3XY midnight-to-dawn program. He returned to the station in the early 1970s (see below).

Because of the lack of listeners, 3XY did not get as much advertising revenue as some of its rivals, but this was, in part, compensated for by the broadcasting of many sponsored religious programs, particularly on Sunday afternoons, as well as sponsored non-English programs, mainly Italian. At the time, 3XY had to comply with an Australian Broadcasting Control Board regulation that required anything broadcast in any foreign language to also be translated into English.
From the commencement of the 1936 Australian rules football season (about seven months after 3XY had first come on air) it became the very first station to broadcast descriptions of Victorian Football Association games. 3XY later broadcast games of the Victorian Football League. They also broadcast descriptions of Melbourne thoroughbred horse races each Saturday, as well as transmitting some interstate races. On some weeknights, harness races, then known as &quot;the trots&quot;, were broadcast.

Prior to 1967, the station had many prominent announcers, as well as a number of broadcasters who would go on to achieve fame at other stations. These included Frank Avis, Laurie Bennett, Graham Berry, Carl Bleazby, John Boland, John Burls, Ray Chapman, Peter Charleston, Bern Davis, Col Denovan, Jack Dyer, Keith Eden, Doug Elliot, Peter Evans, Vi Greenhalf, Mary Hardy, Ken Hibbins, Geoff Hiscock, Ken Howard, Tom Jones, Craig Kelly, Maurie Kirby, Wayne Kirby, Paul Konik, Alwyn Kurts, Ray Lawrence, Barry Looms, Bernice (&quot;Binny&quot;) Lum, Alex McNish, Bruce Mansfield, John Magee, Ian Major, Tom Miller, Alf Minister, Bert Newton, Bill Passick, Sir Eric Pearce, Stan Rofe, Bob Rogers, Will Sampson, Dennis Scanlon, Barry Seeber, Wallace Sharland, David Shoreland, Paul Sime, Clyde Simpson, Eric (&quot;Tiny&quot;) Snell, Roy Stenye, Cyril Stokes, John Storr, Jeff Sunderland, Madge Thomas, Frank Thring Jr., Hal Todd, Iven Walker, Mike Walsh, Jeff Warden, Dorothy Wilby, Madge Wister, Johnny Young, etc.

Between 1954 and 1962, 3XY was Victoria&#x27;s only 24-hour broadcaster. (In the 1930s, the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department issued 24-hour licences to one station in each capital city market except Melbourne. In Melbourne, since 1931, 3AK had been broadcasting almost exclusively in the early-morning hours when other stations were off the air. However, on 1 February 1954, 3AK began broadcasting exclusively during hours of daylight, and concurrently 3DB, 3UZ and 3XY were all given 24-hour licences, but both 3DB and 3UZ had ceased all-night broadcasting within six months. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board had granted 24-hour licences to all Melbourne commercial stations; 24-hour transmission on ABC stations was to follow within a few years.)

&quot;An excellent history of the first 10 years or so of 3XY can be accessed in the following book: Fitzpatrick, Peter, &quot;The Two Frank Thrings&quot;, 2012, Monash University Publishing, Clayton, Victoria.&quot;

====1967–1989 – Melbourne&#x27;s top pop music station====
From 1 July 1967, under the direction of General Manager Bob Baeck the station became Melbourne&#x27;s dominant music radio station and remained so until the mid 1980s, with a Top 40 music radio format, which often topped the ratings. Its sister station during this era was Sydney&#x27;s 2SM. Of the many promotions conducted by the station, the most important during the 1970s/80s was &quot;Rocktober&quot; held annually during the month of October.

3XY dropped all of its religious programming in the late 1960s under the direction of Program Manager Dick Heming. (Heming received a letter of complaint from a woman who signed herself &#x27;Yours in Christianity&#x27; but which concluded: &#x27;I have prayed to the Lord that you be struck dead&#x27;.)

In the early 1970s, there was a head-on battle for the lucrative Top 40 market between 3XY, by then managed by Rod Muir, and Rhett Walker&#x27;s 3AK. The fact that 3XY won the battle is reflected in 3AK&#x27;s rapid change away from its Top 40 format. However, 3XY&#x27;s fortunes declined in the late 1980s after the advent of FM radio in Australia, a few years earlier.

3XY DJs during this era included: Barry Bissell, Jack Daniels, Greg Evans, Peter Grace, Peter Harrison, Jane Holmes, John Hood, Craig Huggins, Kevin Hillier, Mark Irvine, Peter James, Chris Maxwell, Peter O&#x27;Callaghan, John O&#x27;Donnell, John Peters, Stan Rofe, Lee Simon, Peter &quot;Grubby&quot; Stubbs, Richard Stubbs, Gary Suprain, Paul Turner, Karl van Est.

As well as its Top 40 format, in the early 1970s, 3XY also experimented with a &quot;personality&quot; format with Bert Newton conducting the breakfast program, and Graham Kennedy presenting a morning session from a studio especially constructed at a cost of $10,000 in the bedroom of his house in Frankston, thus saving him from even having to leave home to present the show. He often broadcast whilst in pyjamas. During the late 1970s Derryn Hinch presented a current affairs morning program.

The Liberal Party continued to have a marked influence at 3XY. In the late 1970s and 80s, the manager of the station was Stanley Guilfoyle, husband of Liberal Senator Margaret Guilfoyle. Magnus Cormack, a former Liberal senator, served as chairman of the company after his retirement from politics in 1978. The company&#x27;s articles of association provided that, upon the sale of the company, any proceeds should be &quot;given or transferred to some institution or institutions having objects similar to the objects of the company&quot;. In 1986, the radio licence was sold to businessman Paul Dainty for $15 million. The proceeds were used to establish the Cormack Foundation, which became a major donor to the Victorian Liberals.

====1989–1991 – The temporary end of the 3XY callsign====
After losing the ratings and financial battle with FM rivals Eon FM and Fox FM, the 3XY licence was bought in late 1989 by the parent company of Bay FM, a Geelong based station which was then just about to come on air. When Bay FM commenced broadcasting in December 1989, 3XY briefly simulcast the BAY-FM overnight programs, retaining its rock music format during the day. However, once new studios in Corio Bay were completed, Bay FM and 3XY began full-time simulcasting, 3XY breaking only for coverage of Australian Football League (AFL) games, which they were contracted to cover. After a period of 12 months, the then-Australian Broadcasting Authority demanded that the two stations begin separate programming. While the two stations remained in their Corio studios, Bay FM relaunched with an easy listening format, with 3XY retaining its soft rock format. In 1991, 3XY was sold to AWA, owners of 2CH Sydney and other stations, who almost immediately shut the station down and re-opened it seven months later as 3EE.

3XY&#x27;s transmitter was turned off at 1.00 pm on 23 September 1991. The final on-air program as 3XY was a one-hour pre-recorded special, commissioned by AWA and produced and presented by music historian Glenn A Baker. It was a tribute showcasing the music of 1976 when 3XY was number one in the radio ratings. Roxanne Bennett was the last &#x27;live&#x27; announcer on 3XY, finishing her shift at 12 noon that day with Spectrum&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot; the final song played before the one hour pre-recorded special was aired. The last song to be ever aired on 3XY, was AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;, at the end of the pre-recorded special.

AWA formally applied for a change of callsign from 3XY to 3EE and a change of frequency from 1422 kHz to 693 kHz. Both requests were granted by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Although it was a relaunch of the 3XY licence that had existed since 1935 and not the issuing of a new licence, AWA chose to promote the forthcoming 3EE as a &quot;completely new&quot; station.

A new licence for the 1422 kHz frequency was purchased at auction in 1994 by the Greek Media Group. Initially the licence was for a specified period of three years, and was then to be subject to a five yearly auction cycle. This rule was removed, and the station was effectively permitted to continue on a permanent basis. The new station adopted the 3XY call-sign. It is a narrowcast Greek language commercial station, with no connection to the station of 1935–91.

===1992–1993: 3EE===
The &quot;new&quot; station 3EE began official transmission at 7.00am Friday 2 July 1992. Promoted as &quot;The Breeze&quot;, the station had a mix of easy listening music, personality talk and Saturday AFL football. Some programs garnered a loyal following but overall the station failed to gain a commercially viable audience in its target demographic of people aged 40+. AWA had a three-year strategy to grow the 3EE audience, but in 1993 the company decided to exit the commercial broadcasting sector and concentrate on its core business of electronics design and manufacture. AWA sold 3EE to Wesgo, owner of another Melbourne station, 3MP, based in Frankston, an outer south-eastern suburb. A few months later in 1994, AWA sold 3EE&#x27;s sister station in Sydney 2CH, bringing to an end AWA&#x27;s 70 years in radio broadcasting.

===1993–2017: Magic 693/1278===
====Magic 693====
3MP and 3EE simulcast their programs until the ABA ordered that they cease the practice and recommence two separate formats. As from December 1993, 3EE used the marketing name of &quot;Magic 693&quot;, whilst retaining its official call-sign 3EE. It had a 1940s, 1950s and 1960s music format, while 3MP maintained its more mainstream easy listening format on 1377.

Southern Cross Broadcasting, which also owned Melbourne radio stations 3AK and 3AW, bought the 3MP and 3EE licences, and in accordance with media ownership laws which restrict any organisation from owning more than two radio stations in one region, they chose to keep 3AW and 3EE (&quot;Magic 693&quot;), while selling off the lower rating 3AK and 3MP licences.

====Magic 1278====
From 1 May 2006, Magic 693 became Magic 1278 after switching frequencies with 3AW. The change was suggested by 3AW&#x27;s then Midnight-to-Dawn host Keith McGowan. By doing so, it placed 3AW between Radio National and ABC Radio Melbourne, meaning that Melbourne&#x27;s three major talk stations were together on the AM radio dial.

On 13 April 2015, the station&#x27;s entire on air line-up, and most of the programming and production team, was made redundant, as the result of the merger of Fairfax Media&#x27;s radio assets and the Macquarie Radio Network. Immediately, a new music format was introduced that focused on the classic hits of the 1960s and 1970s. In November 2015, it was announced that the station would begin networking programming into Brisbane on sister station Magic 882. The last song to be played on Magic 1278 was &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; by ABBA.

===2017–2018: Talking Lifestyle===
On 27 February 2017, Macquarie Radio Network relaunched 3EE as Talking Lifestyle. The launch of Talking Lifestyle into the Melbourne and Brisbane market followed 18 months of development by Macquarie Media and a soft launch in the Sydney market in September 2016 through 2UE. The Brisbane outlet was 4BH.

Presenters for the station broadcast from either Sydney or Melbourne. The on-air line-up included Ed Phillips, Catriona Rowntree, Nick Bennett, Dee Dee Dunleavy and Sabina Read.

===2018–2020: Macquarie Sports Radio===
On Wednesday 4 April 2018, the three Talking Lifestyle branded stations relaunched with a new sports radio format under the name Macquarie Sports Radio with coverage of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. 1278 did broadcast Melbourne Storm matches as well as a selection of interstate NRL matches broadcast by the Continuous Call Team

=== 2020–2021: Magic 1278 (second incarnation) ===
On 21 January 2020, Nine Entertainment announced the Macquarie Sports Radio brand would be abandoned and the station – along with its interstate sister stations 2UE and 4BH – would return to an all-music format &quot;built around the best of the &#x27;50s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s&quot; with a &quot;soft launch&quot; on 2 February 2020.

====Nine Radio leases Magic 1278 to Ace Radio====
On 28 October 2021, Nine Radio and Ace Radio entered into a deal for Ace to manage the radio station, along with sister stations 2UE and 4BH, from early 2022. Ace Radio took control of the station on 14 January 2022. The station relaunched with a new presenter line-up, logo and imaging on this date.

<doc id="551303" wikidata="Q355013" url="?curid=551303" title="Bretislav I">
<text>Bretislav I (; 1002/1005 – 10 January 1055), known as the &quot;Bohemian Achilles&quot;, of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 1034 until his death in 1055.

==Youth==
Bretislav was the son of Duke Oldřich and his low-born concubine Božena. As an illegitimate son who could not obtain a desirable wife by conventional means, he chose to kidnap Judith of Schweinfurt, a daughter of the Bavarian noble Henry of Schweinfurt, Margrave of Nordgau, in 1019 at Schweinfurt, and marry her.

During his father&#x27;s reign, in 1019 or 1029, Bretislav took back Moravia from Poland. About 1031, he invaded Hungary in order to prevent its expansion under king Stephen. The partition of Bohemia between Oldřich and his brother Jaromír in 1034 was probably the reason why Bretislav fled beyond the Bohemian border, only to come back to take the throne after Jaromír&#x27;s abdication.

==Raid into Poland==
In 1035, Bretislav helped Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II in his war against the Lusatians. In 1039, he invaded Lesser and Greater Poland, captured Poznań, sacked Gniezno, and brought the relics of St. Adalbert, Radim Gaudentius and the Five Brothers back with him. On the way back, he regained part of Silesia, including Wrocław. His main goal was to set up an archbishopric in Prague and create a large state subject only to the Holy Roman Empire. His raid had an unintended enduring influence on Polish history, as the plundering and destruction of Gniezno forced the next Polish rulers to move their capital to Kraków, which would retain this role for many centuries ahead.

In 1040, the German King Henry III invaded Bohemia, but was forced to retreat after he lost the Battle at Brůdek (a pass in the Bohemian Forest). The following year, Henry III invaded again, skirted the border defences and laid siege to Bretislav in Prague. Forced by a mutiny among his nobles and betrayed by Bishop Šebíř of Prague, Bretislav had to renounce all of his conquests save for Moravia and recognize Henry III as his sovereign. In 1042, Emperor Henry III granted Bretislav Silesia as a lien.

In 1047, Emperor Henry III negotiated a peace treaty between Bretislav and the Poles. This pact worked in Bretislav&#x27;s favour, as the Polish ruler swore never again to attack Bohemia in return for an annual subsidy to Gniezno.

==Domestic policy==
Bretislav was the author of decrees concerning the rules of Christianization, which included a ban on polygamy and trade on holidays.

It was in 1030 that Bretislav married Judith of Schweinfurt. In 1054, he established rules for the ducal succession and introduced agnatic seniority as the law of succession. Younger members of the dynasty were supposed to govern fiefs (technically, parts of Moravia), but only at the duke&#x27;s discretion. The result of this succession policy was the relative indivisibility of the Czech lands, but also bitter conflicts over succession and territorial primacy between members of the dynasty. It was effectively ended by the elevation of Bohemia to the status of a kingdom under Ottokar I of Bohemia, which led to the establishment of primogeniture as the ruling principle for succession rights.

Bretislav&#x27;s eldest son Spytihněv was to succeed him as Duke of Bohemia with control over it domains. Moravia was incorporated into the Bohemian duchy, but divided among three of his younger sons. The Olomouc Appanage went to Vratislaus; the Znojmo Appanage went to Conrad I; and the Brno Appanage went to Otto I. The youngest son, Jaromír, entered the church and became Bishop of Prague.

Bretislav died at Chrudim in 1055 during preparations for another invasion of Hungary and was succeeded by his son Spytihněv II as Duke of Bohemia. His sons Otto and Vratislav were shut out of the government by Spytihněv, but after his death gained control of Moravia and Bohemia, respectively.

==Family==

Bretislav married Judith, the daughter of Margrave Henry of Schweinfurt. The House of Přemysl wished to confirm its good relationship with the Babenbergs through a marriage to Judith in 1020. Judith was a desirable bride, but Oldřich of Bohemia had only one son, Bretislav, and he was of illegitimate birth, thus complicating the prospect of a marriage with the high-born Judith. Bretislav solved the problem by kidnapping Judith from a monastery in Schweinfurt. He was never punished for this crime, and he married Judith some time later. Their first son Spytihněv was born after almost ten years, which led to the hypothesis that the kidnapping happened in 1029, although Judith may have given birth to daughters before her first son. In all, there were five sons from the marriage that survived into adulthood:

*Spytihněv II, Duke of Bohemia
*Vratislaus II of Bohemia
*Conrad I, Duke of Bohemia
*Otto I of Olomouc
*Jaromír, Bishop of Prague

==Legacy==
Bretislav I was buried in the old St. Vitus Church in Prague, founded by Wenceslaus I in 930, and his tomb is now situated in the Chapel of St. Wenceslaus in the St. Vitus Cathedral built in the period 1344–66. Bretislav I was depicted in the fresco composition of the Přemyslid dynasty at the Znojmo Rotunda, painted in the period 1134–61.

<doc id="551304" wikidata="Q7670006" url="?curid=551304" title="TEN (TV station)">
<text>TEN is Network 10&#x27;s flagship station in Sydney. It was originally owned and operated by United Telecasters Sydney Limited (UTSL), and began transmission on 5 April 1965 with the highlight of the opening night being the variety special &quot;TV Spells Magic&quot;. It also serves as the Australian headquarters of Paramount.

==History==
Ten commenced broadcasting on 5 April 1965 after United Telecasters was granted a Sydney commercial broadcasting licence. Shareholders in United Telecasters included Amalgamated Wireless, Colonial Sugar Refining and Email with 14% each, Bank of New South Wales with 7.5% and the NRMA with 2.5%.

TEN often lagged in the ratings behind the more established commercial channels TCN (Nine) and ATN (Seven) who had dominated viewing habits in Sydney for eight years. The turning point came in 1972 with the premiere of the raunchy soap opera series &quot;Number 96&quot; which immediately lifted TEN&#x27;s overall profile and helped raise the ailing network to No. 1 position by 1973.

TEN launched Australia&#x27;s first metropolitan nightly one-hour news bulletin in 1975, while NBN-3 in Newcastle was first to air a one-hour news service in Australia in 1972. In 1978, Katrina Lee became only the third female TV newsreader on Australian TV – the first being Melody Iliffe on QTQ-9. The current anchor for the 10 News First 5pm Sydney news bulletin on weeknights is Sandra Sully.

TEN commenced digital television transmission on 1 January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 11 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 10.

The analogue signal for TEN was shut off on 3 December 2013.

Since 2021, the Pyrmont premises also houses office facilities for Network 10 sister channels MTV and Nick.

==Studio facilities==
TEN&#x27;s broadcast facilities have been in the inner city suburb of Pyrmont since 1997. These studios feature a large open plan newsroom and news-set where all Ten&#x27;s national and local Sydney news bulletins are produced. This facility is also the network&#x27;s head office and broadcasts the network signal to other cities. When TEN-10 opened in 1965, it operated from newly built studio facilities at North Ryde, these were sold in the 1990s when the network underwent financial turmoil. The North Ryde complex, which was used by Global Television in recent years, was demolished in September 2007. Following the move from North Ryde in 1991, TEN relocated to a small warehouse in Ultimo, and then to new studios in nearby Pyrmont in May 1997. Most series are produced on location or at external studios by external companies, but a few programs are made in-house by TEN.

==News and current affairs==

TEN-10 produces a local news program on weeknights from its studios at Pyrmont. &quot;10 News First Sydney&quot; is presented by Sandra Sully on weekdays and Chris Bath on weekends with sport presenters Tara Rushton (Monday-Friday) and Scott Mackinnon (Saturday and Sunday), weather presenters Josh Holt (weekdays) and Amanda Jason (weekends) and traffic reporter Vic Lorusso.

The 5pm bulletin was presented for almost eleven years by Ron Wilson and Jessica Rowe, between 1996 and 2005, when Rowe moved to present the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. She was replaced by the network&#x27;s US correspondent Deborah Knight from 2006. Wilson anchored the nightly Sydney news until January 2009 when he became a presenter of the national &quot;Early News&quot; and was replaced by Bill Woods. Knight was replaced by Sully in October 2011 following the axing of the network&#x27;s long-running late night news program, as a result with Knight&#x27;s decision to move to the Nine Network. Sully became sole anchor after Woods&#x27; departure on 30 November 2012, following the network&#x27;s decision not to renew his contract.

Fill-in presenters include Scott Mackinnon (Sport) and Amanda Duval or Amanda Hart (Weather).

As of September 2020, TEN-10 also oversees studio production of the Brisbane edition of &quot;10 News First&quot;. The Brisbane and Sydney bulletins are presented by Sandra Sully, combining local opt-outs for news, sport and weather with some shared content. For three years, TEN-10 also produced the Perth edition for viewers in WA until production returned to Perth in 2023, and instead co-produces the Adelaide edition for audiences in South Australia. From September 2024, production of the Brisbane bulletin will be returned to Brisbane, with Sharyn Ghidella to present.

<text>These are lists of planets. A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. There are eight planets within the Solar System; planets outside of the solar system are also known as exoplanets.

 Most of these were discovered by the Kepler space telescope. There are an additional 1,982 potential exoplanets from Kepler&#x27;s first mission yet to be confirmed, as well as 975 from its &quot;Second Light&quot; mission and 4,679 from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.

<doc id="551309" wikidata="Q17147235" url="?curid=551309" title="Windy (song)">
<text>&quot;Windy&quot; is a pop song written by Ruthann Friedman and recorded by the Association. The song reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in July 1967, becoming the group&#x27;s second U.S. No. 1 hit following &quot;Cherish&quot; in 1966. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the record as the No. 4 song for 1967. 

The lead vocals were sung primarily by guitarist and new band member Larry Ramos along with vocalist Russ Giguere (both would sing lead together in the band&#x27;s last Top 40 hit &quot;Time for Livin&#x27;). Ramos, who was of Filipino descent, was one of the few Asian-American lead singers at the time to have a number one hit single.

==Composition==
Friedman was introduced to the Association by her friend and Beach Boys lyricist Van Dyke Parks. She wrote &quot;Windy&quot; in waltz time, but the group&#x27;s producer Bones Howe changed it to the more common  to ensure the song&#x27;s commercial appeal.

Friedman had written the song about a man but the Association changed the gender in the lyrics. In an interview with Songfacts, she said:

However, in another interview with Songfacts in 2014, she explained that the song was about herself:

==Recording==
The process of recording the vocals was exhausting. The session started in the early afternoon and ended at 6:30 a.m. the next day, and the group then took an 8:30 a.m. flight to a live performance in Virginia. The band was so tired of recording that producer Bones Howe gathered everyone in the studio to sing the track&#x27;s ending, including songwriter Ruthann Friedman.

Because of the poor sales of the Association&#x27;s last album &quot;Renaissance&quot;, on which the group performed all of the songs, Howe recruited session musicians (later known as the Wrecking Crew) for &quot;Windy&quot; and the rest of the &quot;Insight Out&quot; album in order to achieve a radio-friendly sound. The identity of the session musicians who played on the final version of the single is uncertain because the song was recorded during several sessions, but it is likely that Hal Blaine played drums, Joe Osborn played bass, Ray Pohlman played guitar and Larry Knechtel played keyboards. 

==Personnel==
According to the AFM contract sheet, the following musicians played on the track.

*Ray Pohlman
*Hal Blaine
*Dennis Budimir
*Al Casey
*Mike Deasy
*Bones Howe
*Larry Knechtel
*Joe Osborn
*Gary Coleman
*Bill Holman
*Bud Shank
*Gene Cipriano
*Vincent DeRosa
*Richard Perissi

==Chart history==

===Weekly charts===

===Year-end charts===
===All-time charts===

==Notable cover versions==
*Later in 1967, an instrumental version by jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery became his highest-charting Hot 100 hit when it peaked at No. 44. It also reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart. Andy Williams also recorded the song.
