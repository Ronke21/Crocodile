<text>Ticketmaster Entertainment, LLC is an American ticket sales and distribution company based in Beverly Hills, California, with operations in many countries around the world. In 2010, it merged with Live Nation under the name Live Nation Entertainment.

The company&#x27;s ticket sales are fulfilled digitally or at its two main fulfillment centers located in Charleston, West Virginia, and Pharr, Texas for both primary and secondary markets. Ticketmaster&#x27;s clients include venues, artists and promoters. Clients control their events and set ticket prices, and Ticketmaster sells tickets that the clients make available to them. Ticketmaster also owns and operates TicketWeb, a ticketing website geared towards independent venues.

Ticketmaster is subject to numerous controversies and lawsuits, alleging violations of various laws. The platform charges a fee on tickets purchased and resold on the platform. The fees from ticket sales can account for a large percentage of overall ticket costs and have received scrutiny from regulators, customers, and musicians. The company has also faced scrutiny from the United States Department of Justice for retaliation against venues violating its 2010 10-year consent decree from the Live Nation merger, which has been extended an additional five years from 2020 through 2025.

Following the widespread criticism of the company&#x27;s handling of the pre-sale of Taylor Swift&#x27;s The Eras Tour in November 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began a formal investigation into Live Nation Entertainment on the grounds of monopoly, antitrust law and consumer rights violations. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee examined the merger with a hearing in January 2023. On May 23, 2024, the DOJ and a coalition of 29 states formally launched an antitrust suit against Live Nation and Ticketmaster. An additional 10 states joined the lawsuit, bringing the total number of co-plaintiffs to 40.

== History ==
Ticketmaster was founded in Phoenix, Arizona in 1976 by college staffers Peter Gadwa and Albert Leffler, Gordon Gunn III, as well as businessman Jerry Nelson. The company originally licensed computer programs and sold hardware for ticketing systems. Its first ticketed concert was Electric Light Orchestra, held at the University of New Mexico.

In 1982, Fred Rosen was appointed CEO of Ticketmaster and moved the company to Los Angeles to be closer to the live entertainment industry. The move enabled the company to build contracts with many well-known venues including the LA Forum. Rosen drove investment into the company and led the switch to computerized ticketing. By 1985 the company had operations in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Under Rosen, the company moved into publishing and set up a travel agency and acquired rival Ticketron in 1991, making it the market leader.

In November 1993, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen acquired an 80% stake for more than $325 million.

=== InterActiveCorp years ===
In 1998, USA Networks Inc., later named InterActiveCorp (IAC), purchased a majority stake in Ticketmaster. That same year, the company merged with CitySearch and was renamed Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch. In May 2000, Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch acquired TicketWeb Inc., a ticket vendor that sold tickets online and over the phone. In 2003, IAC repurchased the remaining Ticketmaster stock that it had previously sold off.

In September 2006, Ticketmaster President Sean Moriarty told NPR that Ticketmaster had lobbied several states to enact laws that would limit the ticket resale market to authorized companies. Economists worried these laws would harm competition, but Moriarty expressed the need to reduce corrupt scalpers and counterfeit tickets.

In January 2008, Ticketmaster acquired Paciolan Inc., a developer of ticketing system applications and hosted ticketing systems, after litigation over the potential breach of antitrust laws. Also in January, Ticketmaster acquired the UK-based secondary ticket marketplace, Getmein.com. And finally, in that same January, Ticketmaster acquired TicketsNow, a ticket reseller in the United States, for $265 million.

IAC spun off Ticketmaster as its own company in the summer of 2008. Later in 2008, Ticketmaster acquired Front Line Management, an artist management firm that worked with artists such as Aerosmith, Christina Aguilera and Jimmy Buffett. Front Line CEO Irving Azoff became CEO of the new company, which was renamed Ticketmaster Entertainment.

=== Live Nation merger ===
In February 2009, Ticketmaster entered into an agreement to merge with event promoter Live Nation to form Live Nation Entertainment. The deal was cleared by the U.S. Justice Department in January 2010 under the condition that the company sell Paciolan to Comcast Spectacor or another firm, and license its software to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), its biggest competitor. The new company, which would be called Live Nation Entertainment, would also be subject to provisions for 10 years that prevented it from retaliating against venues that partnered with competing ticketing firms. When the DOJ planned to bring court proceedings against the company in 2020 for six violations to these provisions, Live Nation agreed to a settlement that extended them an additional fine years to 2025. Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino was named CEO of the new company.

One year after merging, Live Nation settled a previous class action lawsuit against Ticketmaster which alleged that the company had misled plaintiffs in its descriptions of delivery and processing fees.

=== Growth and acquisitions ===
In 2015, Ticketmaster acquired Front Gate Tickets, a music festival ticketing service that provided services for festivals including Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits. The same year, the company acquired Universe, a DIY ticketing platform, and Two Toasters, a mobile app developer. In 2017, TicketWeb, Ticketmaster&#x27;s self-service ticketing platform, acquired Strobe Labs, a marketing platform that allows users to market to fans through social media. In 2018, Ticketmaster acquired UPGRADED, a company which converts physical tickets into digital ones, utilising blockchain. In 2020, Ticketmaster acquired Taiwan&#x27;s Tixcraft () for entering the Asian market.

== Products and services ==

Ticketmaster sells tickets that its clients make available to it. In 2009, Ticketmaster released a digital ticketing system that required customers to prove their identity prior to purchase. The company believed this would help circumvent brokers and scalpers.

In 2016, Ticketmaster released a statement in favor of the Better Online Ticket Sales Act (BOTS Act), which banned the use of ticket bots to buy large amounts of tickets online and resell them at inflated prices. The following year, the company filed a lawsuit against the ticket broker Prestige Entertainment after the company used bots to buy more than 30,000 tickets to the Broadway play &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

The company reported nearly 500 million tickets sold for 400,000 events in 2018.

In November 2020, Ticketmaster announced it will check the COVID-19 vaccination status of ticket buyers before issuing passes when live events return in 2021. Fans that either failed to verify their vaccination status or tested positive would be denied access to the event.

=== Pricing ===
The face value of Ticketmaster tickets is determined by the artist or client. In addition to the face value price, venues and Ticketmaster add fees to pay for their services.

Typically, fees added to a ticket&#x27;s face value have included:

*Facility charge – Charge added by the venue.
*Delivery fee – Charges added dependent on the ticket delivery method and credit card processing fees.
*Service fee – Sum of charges added based on the &quot;agreement with each client (artists)&quot; and the order processing fee. Ticketmaster &quot;may earn a profit on the order processing fee&quot;.

As the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has explained, &quot;the &#x27;service fee&#x27; is intentionally kept separate from the list price for two reasons: to make the base price of a ticket appear more affordable, and to create the impression that only Ticketmaster pockets that fee.&quot; In other words, &quot;Ticketmaster is effectively paid to be a punching bag&quot; for consumer frustration with opaque add-on fees, and then some of the fees find their way back to the artist or venue. Utilizing such subterfuge to extract additional revenue from fans without arousing direct backlash towards themselves has become increasingly important for artists. The collapse of record album sales after the year 2000 means that as of the 2020s, 95 percent of artist income comes from concert tours.

Fee amounts vary between events and are dependent on the venue, available delivery methods, and preferences of the artist. Some economists and activist groups have claimed that high ticket prices are due to a lack of competition within the music industry.

In 2013, the jam band The String Cheese Incident gave fans money to purchase 400 tickets to one of its shows in order to resell them on its own site with fewer fees. The band said they were protesting Ticketmaster&#x27;s ticket fees, while Ticketmaster argued that the band was taking revenue from venues and promoters.

As of 2016, ticket resale was Ticketmaster&#x27;s fastest growing business.

In 2022, Ticketmaster was experimenting with a demand-based, dynamic pricing which would vary the ticket price based upon demand. The new system is touted to give artists a higher share of the revenues that would otherwise be coming through resale ticket sales.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Anti-competition claims===
In May 1994, the grunge band Pearl Jam filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice claiming Ticketmaster had cut the group out of venue bookings in a dispute over fees. The investigation was closed without action in 1995, though the Justice Department stated it would continue to monitor the developments in the ticket industry. Chuck Philips, a reporter who covered the issue, was told by sources close to the case that the investigation was closed due to a combination of a shortage of resources and the case being difficult and having uncertain prospects.

In a 2009 article by the CBC, Ticketmaster argued that legislation was needed in Ontario to protect fans from scalpers and unauthorized ticket brokers saying, &quot;You and I both know there is a thriving ticket-broker industry ... so the law is really a fiction ... We very strongly feel the law needs to be modernized to reflect the reality of internet commerce. By keeping a price cap in place, you&#x27;re really just driving the [resale] business into the shadows.&quot; That same year, musician Bruce Springsteen complained of a conflict of interest between Ticketmaster and TicketsNow after fans were directed to TicketsNow once tickets to his concert sold out on Ticketmaster.com. Irving Azoff, Ticketmaster CEO at the time, released an apology and stated that the TicketsNow link would no longer be shown for Springsteen&#x27;s concerts. In 2018, the United States Department of Justice began reviewing complaints by AEG that claimed the company had engaged in anti-competitive practices. As of April 2018, the Department of Justice had not released comments on its investigation.

In 2020, the Department of Justice fined Ticketmaster $3 million for violating a consent decree resulting from the Live Nation merger. The consent decree is extended through 2025 and is required to enforce its own compliance with the decree with a penalty of $1 million for any future violations.

On May 23, 2024, the DOJ and a coalition of 29 states formally launched an antitrust suit against Live Nation and Ticketmaster. The lawsuit contends that Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, abused its unrivaled power in the concert and ticketing industry to eliminate competition, lessening consumer choice and resulting in rising prices.

===Rewards program monthly fees===
In May 2013, Ticketmaster agreed to pay up to $23 million for enrolling customers into a rewards program that charged $9 per month. Ticketmaster made $85 million in fees, from customers who took about eight months on average to cancel their enrollment in the program. 1.12 million customers were eligible to claim up to a $30 refund.

===Secret partnership with scalpers===
Ticketmaster has secretly partnered with scalpers to drive up prices for consumers. Economists characterize the secondary market in tickets as socially wasteful rent-seeking. In the mid-2000s, Ticketmaster engaged in primary market auctions that reduced the rents involved in secondary market scalping – however, Ticketmaster ended these primary market auctions, opting instead to enter into the secondary market.

In September 2018, the Toronto Star reported that Ticketmaster was not enforcing ticket limit rules on its resale platform, TradeDesk. Ticketmaster denied the allegations, saying it would examine its resale policies on TradeDesk, and that it &quot;never allows ticket scalpers to buy tickets ahead of fans.&quot; One month later, a group of customers filed a class action lawsuit against Ticketmaster.

In July 2019, a report by &quot;Billboard&quot; revealed a strategy by Live Nation, Ticketmaster&#x27;s parent company, to secretly bypass placing certain tickets for sale on the primary market and instead, place them directly on resale sites &quot;without giving fans a chance to buy them through normal channels at face value.&quot; The company acknowledged it has &quot;facilitated the quiet transfer of concert tickets directly into the hands of resellers through the years, though only at the request of the artists involved.&quot;

=== Data breaches ===
In June 2018, Ticketmaster notified 40,000 U.K. customers that it had identified a hack caused by malicious software on a third-party customer support product it contracted. The company stated that customers who bought tickets between February and June 2018 may have had data compromised.

Between April 2 and May 18, 2024, an &quot;unauthorized third party obtained information from a cloud database hosted by a third-party data services provider&quot; that exposed personal information including payment-card details. Ticketmaster identified customers whose data may have been affected by the breach on May 23, 2024, but only notified them of this a month later in a June 22 letter.

On May 20, 2024, Ticketmaster’s suffered a breach from their database hosted by Snowflake Inc. as part of a mass Snowflake customer data breach. Ticketmaster&#x27;s parent company, Live Nation, revealed the breach on May 31, with Australian authorities confirming they were working with the company on the incident. Further investigation revealed that the hackers were able to access Ticketmaster&#x27;s Snowflake database by using credentials stolen from a 3rd party contractor working for EPAM.

As part of the stolen data, hackers leaked customer information and event barcodes for more than 70,000 Ticketmaster events, including Taylor Swift &#x27;Eras Tour&#x27; and hundreds of other events. 

===Deceptive pricing===
A class action lawsuit was filed against Ticketmaster in 2003, alleging that it did not fully disclose UPS and order processing fees added to tickets sold online. The case settlement was approved in 2015 and Ticketmaster issued vouchers and discount codes to fans who purchased tickets online between 1999 and 2013. In a related case, Ticketmaster filed suit against its liability insurance carrier, Illinois Union Insurance Company, a subsidiary of ACE Limited, in 2010 for failing to aid in its defense in the 2003 suit.

In June 2019, Canada&#x27;s Competition Bureau fined Ticketmaster $4.5 million dollars ($3.44 million US dollars) as part of a settlement after it was discovered that Ticketmaster &quot;topped advertised costs by more than 20% -- and sometimes as much as 65%.&quot; In addition to the required payment, Ticketmaster signed a consent agreement to ensure its advertising policies abide by Canadian law.

===Competitor computer hacking===
In December 2020, Ticketmaster &quot;entered into a plea agreement with federal prosecutors&quot; and agreed to pay a $10 million fine after being charged with illegally accessing computer systems of a competitor. According to FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Williams Sweeney, &quot;Ticketmaster used stolen information to gain an advantage over its competition, and then promoted the employees who broke the law.&quot; The allegations were first reported in 2017 when a former CrowdSurge top executive hired by Ticketmaster hacked into his former employer&#x27;s database.

=== Dynamic pricing and &quot;platinum&quot; tickets ===
Ticketmaster and Live Nation has faced backlash for their dynamic pricing system and &quot;platinum&quot; tickets when tickets for Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s and Blink-182&#x27;s 2023 tours went on sale in July and October 2022 respectively, which saw fans of both acts criticize prices for random seats across the venue going for hundreds or thousands of dollars during pre-sales or right when tickets went on sale for the general public. In March 2023, Robert Smith criticized the model and announced that the Cure would not be allowing Ticketmaster to sell dynamically-priced or platinum tickets for the band&#x27;s upcoming North American tour. Smith priced tickets for the Cure&#x27;s concerts for as low as $20, but Ticketmaster charged fees that equalled more than the price of the base ticket. After Smith expressed his outrage, Ticketmaster refunded a portion of the fees to the purchasers.

=== Taylor Swift tour pre-sale crash ===

On November 15, 2022, the first day of pre-sale of tickets to verified fans for the US leg of the Eras Tour (2023) by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, Ticketmaster&#x27;s official website crashed following &quot;historically unprecedented demand with millions showing up&quot;, halting the pre-sale. In less than an hour of availability, the ticketing platform&#x27;s servers were &quot;unable to answer&quot;, with users &quot;either completely logged out or in a queue 2,000-plus people strong that appeared frozen.&quot; Ticketmaster immediately published a statement saying they are working to fix the issues &quot;as the site was unprepared to accommodate the sheer force of hundreds of thousands of Swift fans&quot;, and subsequently reported that &quot;hundreds of thousands of tickets&quot; had already been sold and rescheduled the remaining onsales to a different time, including the Capital One onsale to November 16.

Fans and customers online widely criticized Ticketmaster for a flawed ticketing model that obstructed them from purchasing tickets. The word &quot;Ticketmaster&quot; was trending number one worldwide on various social media platforms such as Twitter and TikTok. Several US lawmakers took notice of the issue. US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that Ticketmaster is a monopoly and that it must be unmerged from Live Nation Entertainment. Congressman Bill Pascrell, who had previously petitioned US Attorney General Merrick Garland in support of &quot;strong antitrust enforcement by the Biden Administration&quot; and criticized the merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation, stated that he attempted to purchase tickets but was placed on the waitlist. The Tennessee Attorney General, Jonathan Skrmetti, began an investigation into &quot;consumer complaints about chaos during the presale of tickets&quot; to the tour. He said in a press conference on November 16 that &quot;a lack of competition [for Ticketmaster] has led to a poor experience and higher prices for consumers.&quot; Following investigations initiated by the Tennessee Attorney General and the North Carolina Attorney General on the grounds of consumer rights violations, the federal Department of Justice began an investigation into Live Nation Entertainment and Ticketmaster on November 18.

Swift released a statement on November 18, 2022, via her Instagram story; she asserted that she is protective of her fans and wanted to assure a quality experience for them, but found it difficult to &quot;trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties&quot;. She said that she was &quot;not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked [Ticketmaster], multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.&quot; She concluded that she is taking the necessary measures to resolve the issue and resume the sale.

In December, a group of Swift&#x27;s fans, called &quot;Swifties,&quot; filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation, accusing them of fraud, anti-trust violations, and price-fixing. In the lawsuit, fans demanded $2,500 for each violation, which could potentially amount to several million in total.

=== Cloned and invalid Bad Bunny concert tickets ===
On December 9, 2022, the day of Bad Bunny&#x27;s first concert of his World&#x27;s Hottest Tour in Mexico City, an unprecedented number of tickets were cancelled, affecting a considerable group of concertgoers, whose tickets were confiscated and destroyed. Because of this, Ticketmaster received a great amount of criticism because many of the attendees who were denied entry were accused of having counterfeit or cloned tickets, even though those attendees presented proof of payment or their ticket had not even been previously scanned. The procurator of Office of the Federal Prosecutor for the Consumer, described on Twitter that the agency had already requested a report from Ticketmaster Mexico on what happened at the Estadio Azteca and asked affected consumers to formalize their complaints under the terms of the law. Due to the criticism, Ticketmaster Mexico released a statement through their social networks apologizing and saying that &quot;the inconveniences in the accesses were a consequence of the presentation of an unprecedented number of fake tickets, which caused an out of the ordinary agglomeration of people and an intermittent operation of our system&quot;. They also offered refunds for the full cost of the tickets. However, PROFECO ordered that those affected not only be refunded the full cost of the ticket, but an additional 20%.

=== United States Senate committee hearing ===
On January 24, 2023, a three-hour hearing by the Senate judiciary committee, titled &quot;That&#x27;s the Ticket: Promoting Competition and Protecting Consumers in Live Entertainment&quot;, to analyze &quot;the long-simmering dissatisfaction over the 2010 consent decree governing the merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation&quot;, was held at 10:00 am EST in the Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. The hearing was telecast live. Various media outlets reported that both the Democrat and Republican senators &quot;grilled&quot; Ticketmaster&#x27;s representative, Joe Berchtold, the company&#x27;s chief financial officer. The senators questioned Berchtold over Ticketmaster&#x27;s monopolistic practices, policies, ticket costs, lack of transparency, lack of defense against bots, and insensitivity to music artists. Berchtold, despite apologizing for the debacle, denied accusations of monopoly and fraud, but accepted that &quot;there are several things we could have done better—including staggering the sales over a longer period of time and doing a better job setting fan expectations for getting tickets&quot; and continued to blame &quot;industrial-scale ticket scalping&quot; and &quot;unprecedented number of bots&quot; in Swift&#x27;s tour debacle. The witnesses prosecuting Ticketmaster included Jerry Mickelson, the president of JAM Creative Productions; and Jack Groetzinger, co-founder of SeatGeek. Live Nation cited several letters of support within its testimony, including one from American country singer Garth Brooks. Free Britney America, a D.C. organization that was part of the Free Britney movement, protested outside the U.S. Capitol during the hearing &quot;in support of ending Ticketmaster-Live Nation&#x27;s monopoly over the live event and ticketing industry.&quot;

=== Zach Bryan scalpers and Drake tour misinformation ===
On December 26, 2022, American country singer Zach Bryan criticized Ticketmaster for his Burn Burn Burn tour (2023) and listed out non-transferrable tickets to stop scalpers. He went on to release a live album, entitled &quot;All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster&quot;.

In March 2023, fans of Canadian rapper Drake also filed a class action lawsuit against Ticketmaster in the Superior Court of Quebec, alleging intentional deception and fraud. Plaintiffs claimed that the on-sale for the It&#x27;s All a Blur Tour, a co-headlining concert tour by Drake and 21 Savage, &quot;intentionally misleads consumers for [Ticketmaster&#x27;s] own financial gain&quot; by concealing information about additional show dates to drive demand and ticket prices. The suit seeks $300 in punitive damages per customer and compensatory damages covering the difference between the &quot;Official Platinum&quot; ticket prices and the regular cost for the seats.

=== Eurovision 2023 on-sale crash ===
For the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool in May 2023, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the host broadcaster BBC partnered with Ticketmaster. Prior to the ticket booking platform going live, many users complained that the Ticketmaster website had crashed with a 500 error. Tickets for the contest&#x27;s final sold out in 36 minutes, with the remaining available shows selling out around an hour later. Following this, tickets were available on third-party resale platforms such as Viagogo, with a general admission standing ticket for the final, originally priced at , being sold for up to .

=== Coronation concert ballot misinformation ===
Ticketmaster was heavily criticised for their handling of the tickets for Coronation Concert of Charles III and Camilla. After two rounds of ticket balloting for guaranteed tickets, remaining unclaimed tickets were released on a first-come, first-served basis to those who had previously applied to the ballot. Despite tickets being fully claimed, thousands of emails were sent to those unsuccessful in the ballot incorrectly informing them that they won tickets. As a result, many people rushed to book travel, accommodation and time off work for the event. Ticketmaster was criticised and the email was labeled &quot;misleading&quot;.

=== Oasis dynamic pricing scrutiny ===
On 31 August 2024, Oasis announced a live reunion tour for 2025. However, many fans criticised the sales process and prices. Many fans sat for hours trying to get tickets, only to be faced with sitting in queues, or worse, the website would crash, losing fans their place. Other fans reported sitting in a queue for a queue. If fans were able to get tickets, the tickets would change from £135 to more than £350. It has been confirmed that these prices, and the demand-induced increase in pricing, would have been set and approved by the band themselves, by Jonathan Brown, chief executive of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers The band said in a statement, however, that they &quot;leave decisions on ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and management&quot; and that they had &quot;at no time had any awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used&quot;. The dynamic pricing system used by Ticketmaster is something artists could choose to opt into, with artists such as Robert Smith of The Cure highlighting this in 2023.

On 5 September 2024 the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it was launching an investigation into Ticketmaster over Oasis concert ticket sales. The CMA said its investigation would include how so-called dynamic pricing may have been used and would scrutinise whether the sale of the tickets may have breached consumer protection law. The investigation would consider whether the firm had engaged in unfair commercial practices, if people were given clear and timely information to explain that the tickets could be subject to dynamic pricing, and if consumers were put under pressure to buy tickets within a short period of time – at a higher price than they understood they would have to pay.

=== Ticket transfer hacking ===
In fall 2024, Ticketmaster customers began noticing tickets were being incorrectly removed from accounts. Despite thousands of customers taking to Ticketmaster&#x27;s social media accounts over a period of months, the platform initially ignored the comments and released a statement in October 2024 indicating that affected customers were &quot;victims of hackers&quot; taking advantage of the platform&#x27;s ticket transfer feature. Despite this, Ticketmaster did not replace missing tickets or pull its ticket transfer feature pending an investigation into the hacking. This issue continued in November 2024 for fans attending an Usher concert, with the tickets only being refunded after fans complained to the Better Business Bureau. Due to Ticketmaster&#x27;s lack of information and action, social media users and fans questioned if the organization was in on the scam itself.

== Partners ==
Ticketmaster has partnerships with venues, professional sports leagues and teams, college and universities, musical acts and theatre tours and target corporation in the United States and internationally. Ticketmaster has partnered with musical acts such as Taylor Swift, and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and theatre productions such as Hamilton and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

<doc id="545777" wikidata="Q630106" url="?curid=545777" title="Guru Har Rai">
<text>Guru Har Rai (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ ਹਰਿ ਰਾਇ, pronunciation: ; 16 January 1630 – 6 October 1661) revered as the &quot;seventh Nanak&quot;, was the seventh of ten Gurus of the Sikh religion. He became the Sikh leader at age 14, on 3 March 1644, after the death of his grandfather and the sixth Sikh leader Guru Hargobind. He guided the Sikhs for about seventeen years, till his death at age 31.

Guru Har Rai is notable for maintaining the large army of Sikh soldiers that the sixth Sikh Guru had amassed, yet avoiding military conflict. He supported the moderate Sufi influenced Dara Shikoh instead of conservative Sunni influenced Aurangzeb as the two brothers entered into a war of succession to the Mughal Empire throne.

After Aurangzeb won the succession war in 1658, he summoned Guru Har Rai in 1660 to explain his support for the executed Dara Shikoh. Guru Har Rai sent his elder son Ram Rai to represent him. Aurangzeb kept Ram Rai as hostage, questioned Ram Rai about a verse in the Adi Granth – the holy text of Sikhs at that time. Aurangzeb claimed that it disparaged the Muslims. Ram Rai changed the verse to appease Aurangzeb instead of standing by the Sikh scripture, an act for which Guru Har Rai is remembered for excommunicating his elder son, and nominating his younger son Har Krishan to succeed him. Har Krishan became the eighth Guru at age five after Guru Har Rai&#x27;s death in 1661.

== Names ==
Some Sikh literature spell his name as Hari Rai. Some modern Sikhs refer to him as the Green Guru due to the sensitivity he displayed to the natural world.

==Biography==
Guru Har Rai was born to Ananti (also known as Nihal) and Baba Gurditta into a Sodhi Khatri household. His father died when he was 8 years old. At age 10, in 1640, Guru Har Rai was married to Mata Kishan Devi (sometimes also referred to as Sulakhni) the daughter of Daya Ram. They had one daughter Rup Kaur and two sons, Ram Rai and Har Krishan (the latter of whom became the eighth Guru).

Guru Har Rai had brothers. His elder brother Dhir Mal had gained encouragement and support from Shah Jahan, with free land grants and Mughal sponsorship. Dhir Mal attempted to form a parallel Sikh tradition and criticized his grandfather and sixth Guru, Hargobind. The sixth Guru disagreed with Dhir Mal, and designated the younger Har Rai as the successor.

Authentic literature about Guru Har Rai life and times are scarce, he left no texts of his own and some Sikh texts composed later spell his name as &quot;Hari Rai&quot;. Some of the biographies of Guru Har Rai written in the 18th century such as by Kesar Singh Chhibber, and the 19th-century Sikh literature are highly inconsistent.

===Dara Shikoh===
Guru Har Rai provided medical care to Dara Shikoh, possibly when he had been poisoned by Mughal operatives. According to Mughal records, Guru Har Rai provided other forms of support to Dara Shikoh as he and his brother Aurangzeb battled for rights to succession. Ultimately, Aurangzeb won, arrested Dara Shikoh and executed him on charges of apostasy from Islam. In 1660, Aurangzeb summoned Guru Har Rai to appear before him to explain his relationship with Dara Shikoh.

In the Sikh tradition, Guru Har Rai was asked why he was helping the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh whose forefathers had persecuted Sikhs and Sikh Gurus. Guru Har Rai is believed to have replied that if a man plucks flowers with one hand and gives it away using his other hand, both hands get the same fragrance.

After Aurangzeb won the succession war in 1658, he summoned Guru Har Rai in 1660 to explain his support for the executed Dara Shikoh. Guru Har Rai sent his elder son Ram Rai to represent him. Aurangzeb kept the 13 year old Ram Rai as hostage, questioned Ram Rai about a verse in the Adi Granth – the holy text of Sikhs. Aurangzeb claimed that it disparaged the Muslims. Ram Rai changed the meanings of the verse to appease Aurangzeb instead of standing by the Sikh scripture, an act for which Guru Har Rai excommunicated his elder son, and nominated the younger Har Krishan to succeed as the next Guru of Sikhism.

=== Influence ===
He started several public singing and scripture recital traditions in Sikhism. The &quot;katha&quot; or discourse style recitals were added by Guru Har Rai to the &quot;sabad kirtan&quot; singing tradition of Sikhs. He also added the &quot;akhand kirtan&quot; or continuous scripture singing tradition of Sikhism, as well as the tradition of &quot;jotian da kirtan&quot; or collective folk choral singing of scriptures.

==== Reforms ====
The third Sikh leader Guru Amar Das had started the tradition of appointing &quot;Manji&quot; (zones of religious administration with an appointed chief called &quot;sangatias&quot;), introduced the &quot;dasvandh&quot; (&quot;the tenth&quot; of income) system of revenue collection in the name of Guru and as pooled community religious resource, and the famed &quot;langar&quot; tradition of Sikhism where anyone, without discrimination of any kind, could get a free meal in a communal seating.

The organisational structure that had helped Sikhs to grow and resist the Mughal persecution had created new problems for Guru Har Rai. The donation collectors, some of the Masands (local congregational leaders) led by Dhir Mal – the older brother of Guru Har Rai, all of them encouraged by the support of Shah Jahan, land grants and Mughal administration – had attempted to internally split the Sikhs into competing movements, start a parallel guruship, and thereby weaken the Sikh religion. Thus a part of the challenge for Guru Har Rai was to keep Sikhs united.

He appointed new masands such as Bhai Jodh, Bhai Gonda, Bhai Nattha, Bhagat Bhagwan (for eastern India), Bhai Pheru (for Rajathan), Bhai Bhagat (also known as Bairagi), as the heads of Manjis.

===Death and succession===
He appointed his 5-year-old youngest son Har Krishan as the eighth Guru of the Sikhs before his death.

== Environmental stewardship ==
Guru Har Rai is associated in the Sikh tradition for his interest in the natural world. Guru Har Rai taught that the environment should be cared for by Sikhs. 

According to a traditional &quot;sakhi&quot; (with there existing variations of the same tale), when Guru Har Rai was a youth, he was strolling in a garden when the cloak of his garb happened to break a flower off of its stem after coming into contact with it. After seeing what had happened, he felt a strong sense of remorse for what had occurred, leading him to carefully ensuring his clothing does not harm any other plants for the rest of his life by being cautious through gathering his clothing while walking. This story depicts the Guru&#x27;s sensitivity to harm of flora.

Guru Har Rai is said to have participated in hunting much like the previous gurus. However in-contrast to his predecessors, he never actually killed the animals he hunted but rather kept them in a zoo located in Kiratpur.

=== Medicinal knowledge ===
A traditional Sikh garden located in Kiratpur, known as Naulakha Bagh (meaning &quot;garden of 900,000 plants&quot;), was believed to have been founded and cared for by Guru Har Rai during his guruship period. It was large and contained many medicinal species of plants. One story narrates that Dara Shikoh was close to death after having been poisoned by tiger whiskers, as per tradition, and the treatments offered by his father, Shah Jahan, failed to absolve his illness. After trying every treatment with no resolve, Shah Jahan eventually made contact with Guru Har Rai for his assistance, with the latter freely offering it to the Mughal prince. Guru Har Rai sent medicinal plants to Shah Jahan to treat his son&#x27;s condition. Despite the hostility that existed at that time between the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and the Sikhs, the Sikh guru still helped the emperor&#x27;s poisoned son, which is a reflection of Guru Har Rai&#x27;s far-reaching compassion.

== Salok Mahalla Satvaan (7) ==
The common Sikh belief is that Guru Hargobind, Guru Har Rai and Guru Harkrishan did not contribute to any Bani at all. This is not entirely true as Guru Har Rai is said to have written the Salok Mahalla Satvaan. 

This mahalla is in the Kiratpuri Bir of the Guru Granth Sahib. Although it is clearly marked as a composition of Guru Har Rai the seventh Mina Guru Miharban also used the marker leaving open the possibility of mistaken attribution. The Salok does not appear in any of the texts containing the writings of Miharban. At the same time no text about the Sikh Gurus lives reference Guru Har Rai writing Bani. It cannot therefore be securely attributed to Guru Har Rai. Gurus each had their own way of starting poems or couplets.

Guru Har Rai&#x27;s was: &quot;Through the voice of Har Rai, the Guru.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 2011, 14 March was the date selected to celebrate Sikh Environment Day because it was the anniversary date of Guru Har Rai&#x27;s &quot;gurgaddi&quot; (ascension to the guruship).

In 2013, the president of EcoSikh described Guru Har Rai as the &quot;green guru&quot;, emphasizing the Sikh guru&#x27;s close-bond with nature, in a press-release statement.

== Popular culture ==
In 2013, a painting by Rahi Mohinder Singh was gifted to EcoSikh which depicts Guru Har Rai giving a tree to a petitioner to plant, however the tree species portrayed in the painting is an eucalyptus, a non-native species that was not found during the lifetime of Guru Har Rai, making the painting anachronistic.

<doc id="545782" wikidata="Q1414096" url="?curid=545782" title="Muscle spindle">
<text>Muscle spindles are stretch receptors within the body of a skeletal muscle that primarily detect changes in the length of the muscle. They convey length information to the central nervous system via afferent nerve fibers. This information can be processed by the brain as proprioception. The responses of muscle spindles to changes in length also play an important role in regulating the contraction of muscles, for example, by activating motor neurons via the stretch reflex to resist muscle stretch.

The muscle spindle has both sensory and motor components.
* Sensory information conveyed by primary type Ia sensory fibers which spiral around muscle fibres within the spindle, and secondary type II sensory fibers
* Activation of muscle fibres within the spindle by up to a dozen gamma motor neurons and to a lesser extent by one or two beta motor neurons

==Structure==
Muscle spindles are found within the belly of a skeletal muscle. Muscle spindles are fusiform (spindle-shaped), and the specialized fibers that make up the muscle spindle are called intrafusal muscle fibers. The regular muscle fibers outside of the spindle are called extrafusal muscle fibers. Muscle spindles have a capsule of connective tissue, and run parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers unlike Golgi tendon organs which are oriented in series.

=== Composition ===
Muscle spindles are composed of 5-14 muscle fibers, of which there are three types: dynamic nuclear bag fibers (bag1 fibers), static nuclear bag fibers (bag2 fibers), and nuclear chain fibers.

Primary type Ia sensory fibers (large diameter) spiral around all intrafusal muscle fibres, ending near the middle of each fibre.
Secondary type II sensory fibers (medium diameter) end adjacent to the central regions of the static bag and chain fibres.
These fibres send information by stretch-sensitive mechanically-gated ion-channels of the axons.

The motor part of the spindle is provided by motor neurons: up to a dozen gamma motor neurons also known as &quot;fusimotor neurons&quot;. These activate the muscle fibres within the spindle. Gamma motor neurons supply only muscle fibres within the spindle, whereas beta motor neurons supply muscle fibres both within and outside of the spindle. Activation of the neurons causes a contraction and stiffening of the end parts of the muscle spindle muscle fibers.

Fusimotor neurons are classified as static or dynamic according to the type of muscle fibers they innervate and their effects on the responses of the Ia and II sensory neurons innervating the central, non-contractile part of the muscle spindle.
* The static axons innervate the chain or static bag2 fibers. They increase the firing rate of Ia and II afferents at a given muscle length (see schematic of fusimotor action below).
* The dynamic axons innervate the bag1 intrafusal muscle fibers. They increase the stretch-sensitivity of the Ia afferents by stiffening the bag1 intrafusal fibers.

Efferent nerve fibers of gamma motor neurons also terminate in muscle spindles; they make synapses at either or both of the ends of the intrafusal muscle fibers and regulate the sensitivity of the sensory afferents, which are located in the non-contractile central (equatorial) region.

== Function ==
=== Stretch reflex ===
When a muscle is stretched, primary type Ia sensory fibers of the muscle spindle respond to both changes in muscle length and velocity and transmit this activity to the spinal cord in the form of changes in the rate of action potentials. Likewise, secondary type II sensory fibers respond to muscle length changes (but with a smaller velocity-sensitive component) and transmit this signal to the spinal cord. The Ia afferent signals are transmitted monosynaptically to many alpha motor neurons of the receptor-bearing muscle. The reflexly evoked activity in the alpha motor neurons is then transmitted via their efferent axons to the extrafusal fibers of the muscle, which generate force and thereby resist the stretch. The Ia afferent signal is also transmitted polysynaptically through interneurons (Ia inhibitory interneurons), which inhibit alpha motorneurons of antagonist muscles, causing them to relax.

===Sensitivity modification===
The function of the gamma motor neurons is not to supplement the force of muscle contraction provided by the extrafusal fibers, but to modify the sensitivity of the muscle spindle sensory afferents to stretch. Upon release of acetylcholine by the active gamma motor neuron, the end portions of the intrafusal muscle fibers contract, thus elongating the non-contractile central portions (see &quot;fusimotor action&quot; schematic below). This opens stretch-sensitive ion channels of the sensory endings, leading to an influx of sodium ions. This raises the resting potential of the endings, thereby increasing the probability of action potential firing, thus increasing the stretch-sensitivity of the muscle spindle afferents.

How does the central nervous system control gamma fusimotor neurons? It has been difficult to record from gamma motor neurons during normal movement because they have very small axons. Several theories have been proposed, based on recordings from spindle afferents.
* 1) &quot;Alpha-gamma coactivation.&quot; Here it is posited that gamma motor neurons are activated in parallel with alpha motor neurons to maintain the firing of spindle afferents when the extrafusal muscles shorten.
* 2) &quot;Fusimotor set:&quot; Gamma motor neurons are activated according to the novelty or difficulty of a task. Whereas static gamma motor neurons are continuously active during routine movements such as locomotion, dynamic gamma motorneurons tend to be activated more during difficult tasks, increasing Ia stretch-sensitivity.
* 3) &quot;Fusimotor template of intended movement.&quot; Static gamma activity is a &quot;temporal template&quot; of the expected shortening and lengthening of the receptor-bearing muscle. Dynamic gamma activity turns on and off abruptly, sensitizing spindle afferents to the onset of muscle lengthening and departures from the intended movement trajectory.
* 4) &quot;Goal-directed preparatory control.&quot; Dynamic gamma activity is adjusted proactively during movement preparation in order to facilitate execution of the planned action. For example, if the intended movement direction is associated with stretch of the spindle-bearing muscle, Ia afferent and stretch reflex sensitivity from this muscle is reduced. Gamma fusimotor control therefore allows for the independent preparatory tuning of muscle stiffness according to task goals.

=== Development ===
It is also believed that muscle spindles play a critical role in sensorimotor development.

==Clinical significance==
After stroke or spinal cord injury in humans, spastic hypertonia (spastic paralysis) often develops, whereby the stretch reflex in flexor muscles of the arms and extensor muscles of the legs is overly sensitive. This results in abnormal postures, stiffness and contractures. Hypertonia may be the result of over-sensitivity of alpha motor neurons and interneurons to the Ia and II afferent signals.

<doc id="545789" wikidata="Q381425" url="?curid=545789" title="Guru Hargobind">
<text>Guru Hargobind (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ ਹਰਿਗੋਬਿੰਦ, pronunciation: l 19 June 1595 – 28 February 1644) was the sixth of ten Gurus of the Sikh religion. He had become Guru at the young age of eleven, after the execution of his father, Guru Arjan, by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.

Guru Hargobind introduced the process of militarization to Sikhism, likely as a response to his father&#x27;s execution and to protect the Sikh community. He symbolized it by wearing two swords, representing the dual concept of &quot;mīrī&quot; and &quot;pīrī&quot; (temporal power and spiritual authority). In front of the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar, Hargobind constructed the Akal Takht (&quot;the throne of the timeless one&quot;). The Akal Takht represents the highest seat of earthly authority of the Khalsa (the collective body of the Sikhs) today.

==Early life==
Guru Hargobind was born in &quot;Gurū kī Waḍālī&quot;, on 19th June of 1595, in a Sodhi Khatri Family in a village west of Amritsar, the only son of Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru. He suffered from smallpox as a child.

According to Sikh hagiographies, Guru Hargobind survived two poisoning attempts by his uncle Prithi Chand and his wife, Karmo, as well as another attempt on his life, when a cobra was thrown at him by Prithi Chand. The first poisoning attempt involved Karmo dispatching her personal nurse to pretend to be interested in looking after the child Hargobind. However, the nurse placed poison around her nipple which was to harm Hargobind as he suckled her but the young boy refused to latch onto her and thus the nurse&#x27;s plan failed and she became ill to the poison herself. The second poisoning plan involved a snake-charmer being sent by Prithi Chand and his wife to assassinate the young Hargobind by releasing a snake onto him but the young boy is said to have grabbed the snake in his hand by its head and squeezed it until it died. A third attempt on his life was by a Brahmin directed again by Prithi Chand and his wife, the Brahmin planned to blend poison with curd and feed the child Hargobind with it but when he attempted to do so, Hargobind knocked the curd out of the Brahmin&#x27;s grasp and it fell onto the floor, where a dog - named Pista; then ate some of it and died as a result revealing its dangerous contents. The Brahmin then died of abdominal afflictions.

Guru Hargobind studied religious texts with Bhai Gurdas and was trained in swordsmanship and archery by Baba Budda. He was also instructed on various languages, religious philosophy, astronomy, medicine, horse-riding, and administration. Hargobind spent a good deal of his early years engrossed in hymns being sung at the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar.

== Guruship ==
On 25 May 1606, Guru Arjan, five days before his own death, selected his son Hargobind as his successor and instructed his son to start a military tradition to protect the Sikh people and always keep himself surrounded by armed Sikhs for protection. Shortly afterwards, Arjan was arrested, tortured and killed by order of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Guru Hargobind&#x27;s succession ceremony took place on 24 June 1606. He put on two swords: one indicated his spiritual authority (&quot;pīrī&quot;) and the other, his temporal authority (&quot;mīrī&quot;). He followed his martyred father&#x27;s advice and always kept himself surrounded by armed Sikhs for protection. The number fifty-two was special in his life, and his retinue consisted of fifty-two armed men. He thus founded the military tradition in the Sikh faith.

Hargobind had three wives: Damodari, Nanaki, and Marvahi. He had children from three wives. Two of his eldest sons from the first wife died during his lifetime. Guru Tegh Bahadur, his son from Nanaki, became the ninth Sikh Guru. The Sodhis of Anandpur Sahib are the descendants of Baba Suraj Mal Sodhi, one of Guru Hargobind&#x27;s sons.

The Guru was a martial artist (&quot;shastarvidyā&quot;); he encouraged people to maintain physical fitness and keep their bodies ready for physical combat. He had his own Darbar (court). The arming and training of some of his devoted followers began. The Guru came to possess seven hundred horses and his Risaldari (cavalry) grew to three hundred horsemen and sixty musketeers.

=== Reforms ===
Guru Hargobind&#x27;s reforms to the Sikh faith made long-lasting impacts. No longer were the Sikh gurus relegated to spiritual affairs but now they became engaged more deeply in temporal happenings, fusing both the spiritual and temporal spheres together, and furthermore had adopted &quot;regal civility&quot;. Hardip Singh Syan explains that Guru Hargobind was able to push for these changes as he became a &quot;patrimonial-feudal lord&quot; by offering his followers and devotees both spiritual liberation (&quot;mukti&quot;) and employment (&quot;naukari&quot;). Prior to Hargobind, the Sikh court was popularly seen as offering service (&quot;seva&quot;) and grace (&quot;prasad&quot;). This shift did not go without controversy, with Bhai Gurdas recording in his writings the tensions within in the Sikh community at the time regarding these reforms, with Gurdas highlighting that keeping the guru as the main point of one&#x27;s faith was key.
=== Relations with other rulers ===

Guru Hargobind led the Sikh response against Mughal power after Guru Arjan&#x27;s execution. He nominally accepted Shah Jahan&#x27;s authority but resisted the Islamic persecution, fighting four wars against Shah Jahan&#x27;s armies. His attempts to transform the Sikh community brought him in conflict with the Mughal authority.

==== Jahangir ====
Along with the execution of guru Arjan Dev by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, Guru Hargobind from the very start was a dedicated enemy of the Mughal rule. He advised Sikhs to arm and fight the Mughals. The death of his father at the hands of Jahangir prompted him to emphasize the military dimension of the Sikh community. He symbolically wore two swords, which represented &quot;miri piri&quot;. He founded the Akal Sena, the first Sikh army. He built a fort to defend Ramdaspur and created a formal court, Akal Takht.

Jahangir responded by jailing the 14-year-old Guru Hargobind at Gwalior Fort in 1609, on the pretext that the fine imposed on Guru Arjan had not been paid by the Sikhs and Hargobind. It is not clear as to how much time he spent as a prisoner. The year of his release appears to have been either 1611 or 1612, when Hargobind was about 16 years old. Persian records, such as &quot;Dabestan-e Mazaheb&quot; suggest he was kept in jail for twelve years, including over 1617–1619 in Gwalior, after which he and his camp were kept under Muslim army&#x27;s surveillance by Jahangir.

It is unclear why he was released. Scholars suggest that Jahangir had more or less reverted to tolerant policies of Akbar by about 1611 after he felt secure about his throne, and the Sunnis and Naqshbandi court officials at the Mughal court had fallen out of his favour. Another theory states that Jahangir discovered the circumstances and felt that Guru Hargobind was harmless, so he ordered his release.

According to Surjit Singh Gandhi, 52 rajas (kings) who were imprisoned in the fort as hostages for &quot;millions of rupees&quot; and for opposing the Mughal empire were dismayed as they were losing a spiritual mentor. Guru Hargobind requested the rajas to be freed along with him as well and stood surety for their loyal behavior. Jahangir ordered their release as well. Hargobind got a special gown stitched which had 52 hems. As Hargobind left the fort, the captive kings caught the hems of the cloak and came out along with him.

After his release, Guru Hargobind more discreetly strengthened the Sikh army and reconsolidated the Sikh community. His relations with Jahangir remained mostly friendly. He accompanied Jahangir to Kashmir and Rajputana and subdued Tara Chand of Nalagarh, who had continued for a long time in open rebellion and all efforts to subdue him had failed. During Jahangir&#x27;s reign, Hargobind fought a battle against the Mughals at Rohilla. The battle was in response to the militarisation of the Sikhs. The Mughals who were led by Governor Abdul Khan were defeated by the Sikhs.

==== Shah Jahan ====
During the reign of Jahangir&#x27;s son and successor Shah Jahan that started in 1627, relations became bitter again. Shah Jahan was intolerant. He destroyed the Sikh stepwell at Lahore. In 1628, Shah Jahan&#x27;s hunting party plundered some of Guru Hargobind&#x27;s property, which triggered the first armed conflict.

Hargobind&#x27;s army fought battles with the Mughal armies of Shah Jahan at Amritsar, Kartarpur and elsewhere. Hargobind defeated the Mughal troops near Amritsar in the Battle of Amritsar in 1634. A provincial detachment of Mughals again attacked the Guru, but the attackers were routed and their leaders slain. Guru Hargobind also led his armies against the provincial Mughal governors. The Guru anticipated the return of a more significant Mughal force, so retreated into Shivalik Hills to strengthen his defenses and army, with a base in Kiratpur where he continued to stay till his death.

Painde Khan was appointed the leader of the provincial troops by Shah Jahan and marched upon the Guru. Hargobind was attacked, but he won this battle as well. He also fought the Battle of Kartarpur. Chandu Shah, who had ordered Guru Arjan&#x27;s death, was killed through torture by the Sikhs of Guru Hargobind: a thick iron ring was put around his nose and he was dragged on the floor until the man who tortured Arjan, and had since become a Sikh, poured hot sand on him from the same ladle used on Arjan.

Guru Hargobind lost his eldest son Baba Gurditta in 1638. Shah Jahan attempted political means to undermine the Sikh tradition by dividing and influencing the succession. The Mughal ruler gave land grants to Gurditta&#x27;s eldest son Dhir Mal, living in Kartarpur, and attempted to encourage Sikhs to recognise Dhir Mal as the rightful successor to Hargobind. Dhir Mal issued statements in favour of the Mughal state and critical of his grandfather. Hargobind died at Kiratpur, Rupnagar, Punjab, on 28 February 1644. Before his death, he rejected his eldest grandson Dhir Mal&#x27;s politics and nominated Guru Har Rai (Dhir Mal&#x27;s younger brother) instead to succeed him as the Guru. The pattern was repeated when Guru Har Rai chose his second son as his successor instead of his eldest son.

==== Samarth Ramdas and Guru Hargobind ====
According to Sikh tradition based on an old Punjabi manuscript Panjah Sakhian, Samarth Ramdas met Guru Hargobind at Srinagar in the Garhval hills. The meeting, corroborated in a Marathi source, Ramdas&#x27;s Bakhar, by Hanumant Swami, written in 1793, probably took place in the early 1630s during Samarth Ramdas&#x27;s pilgrimage travels in the north and Hargobind&#x27;s journey to Nanakmata in the east. It is said that as they came face to face with each other, Hargobind had just returned from a hunting excursion. He was fully armed and rode a horse. &quot;I had heard that you occupied the Gaddi of Guru Nanak&quot;, said the Maratha saint Ramdas, and asked what sort of &quot;sadhu&quot; was he. Hargobind replied, &quot;Internally a hermit, and externally a prince. Arms mean protection to the poor and destruction of the tyrant. Guru Nanak had not renounced the world but had renounced Maya&quot;.

== Death ==
He nominated his grandson to succeed him as the seventh Guru Har Rai. He died in 1644 at Kiratpur Sahib, a town on the banks of the River Sutlej, and was cremated on the banks of the river, where now stands Gurdwara Patalpuri Sahib.

== Birth year ==
Whilst 1595 is the commonly accepted birth year of the guru, some authors and sources, such as Kesar Singh Chhibar and the Bhat Vahis, record his year of birth as being 1590.

== Sectarian views ==
Guru Hargobind&#x27;s reforms also had an impact on the Minas, a sect that rose to become a major opponent of the mainstream lineage of Sikh gurus. Prior to Guru Hargobind&#x27;s reign, the Mina literature emulated the writings and appearances of the previous five gurus in-style, whilst portraying themselves as spiritually superior. However, Guru Hargobind conducted himself very different from the previous gurus, thus the Minas were not able to emulate his ethos, and therefore relegated to keep mirroring the environment of the pre-Guru Hargobind Sikh court. Therefore, the Minas attempted to portray themselves as being the preservers of the original bhakti of the Sikh faith, whilst portraying as a result that Guru Hargobind had somehow deviated from the path of original Sikh values and sociopolitical thought.

<doc id="545791" wikidata="Q7717574" url="?curid=545791" title="The Big Chill (music festival)">
<text>The Big Chill was an annual festival of alternative, dance and chill-out music and comedy, held in the grounds of Eastnor Castle during early August. The 2011 line-up included The Chemical Brothers, Kanye West, Rodrigo Y Gabriela, Jessie J, Robert Plant, Calvin Harris, Neneh Cherry, Aloe Blacc, Chipmunk, Katy B &amp; Example. The festival has not been staged since 2011.

==History==
Founded in 1994 by Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin, The Big Chill began as a series of ambient parties at the Union Chapel in Islington, but developed into an outdoor festival in 1995, with an unlicensed event in the Black Mountains of Wales. In the early days the most prominent DJs were Matt Black of Coldcut, Tom Middleton of Global Communication and Mixmaster Morris, also known as the Irresistible Force.

In 1996 the event took place in Norfolk and in 1998 a new home for the event (now known as &quot;The Enchanted Garden&quot;) was found at Larmer Tree Gardens in England where it was held for five years. During this time the festival slowly developed its hallmarks, such as high quality visuals, an excellent range of food stalls, highly unusual line-ups and a Body &amp; Soul field with many healers, masseurs and alternative therapists. In 2001 a second summer festival was also held at Lulworth Castle in Dorset. In 2002 the festival moved to Eastnor Castle where it remained until 2011. In 2002 PK Events Limited was liquidated and 50% shares were sold to the Cantaloupe Group, a company that managed a bar chain. A new company, Chillfest Limited, was created, with Katrina Larkin and Pete Lawrence each owning 25% and retaining a controlling management role in the company. The Big Chill staged many events around the world, in locations such as Naxos (Greek islands), Austalasia, Japan, Goa (India) and all over Europe. In 2007, the Cantaloupe Group bought out Pete Lawrence, who left the company, and some of Katrina Larkin&#x27;s shares, to become the majority shareholder. In 2009, the festival went into liquidation and the brand was bought by Festival Republic. Katrina Larkin moved on to work with Festival Republic as creative director. She handed over creative direction to Festival Republic in 2010.

Throughout its history, The Big Chill showcased a variety of different music, uptempo as well as ambient. Live acts and DJs like Norman Jay, Mr Scruff, Hexstatic, Mixmaster Morris, alucidnation, Laura B, DJ Derek, Leggo Beast and Gilles Peterson were regular performers, but the festival also provided a diverse range of music from folk and jazz to African and dub.

In addition to a widely varied musical line-up, a focus on art, films, poetry, circus, cabaret, comedy and gourmet food all played a key part in setting The Big Chill apart from the competition. The Big Chill saw contributions from and collaborations with many artists and arts bodies, including Johnny Easterby, I Am The Mighty Jungulator Spencer Tunick, Pete Fowler, Gavin Turk, Cedric Christie, Peter Blake, Rankin, Bob &amp; Roberta Smith, Vivienne Westwood, Tate Britain, the British Film Institute, Institute of Contemporary Arts, Bompas &amp; Parr, the Roundhouse, Apples &amp; Snakes, Penguin Books, The World Famous, Film4, and the Art Car Boot Fair.

==Festival Site==
The festival was situated in the grounds of Eastnor Castle near Ledbury in Herefordshire. The grounds are normally used as a reserve for deer. The organisers encouraged a &quot;leave no trace&quot; policy to dissuade people from littering the site. Camping was divided into Red, Blue, Green and Purple areas, as well as Family Camping, Quiet Camping and Accessible Camping.

==Sale to Festival Republic==
In September 2009, Chillfest Limited - the company responsible for running the festival since 2003 - was placed into voluntary liquidation by its owners. The rights to the festival brand were purchased by Festival Republic. Vantis Plc - the company appointed as liquidators - released a statement blaming poor ticket sales for the 2009 festival as the reason for liquidation.

==Cancellation==
In early January 2012, the managing director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, released a statement outlining that the 2012 festival would not be going ahead:

Although there was speculation at the time that a smaller indoor event could see the festivals return in 2013, this was revealed not to be the case the following January when the organisers released a statement informing there were &quot;no plans&quot; for a return that year.

In August 2013 it was again announced that there were &quot;no plans&quot; for a 2014 festival, leading to doubt that the event would return again.

==World record==
In 2009 Chris Boyle, the filmmaker for the independent film &quot;I Spit on Your Rave&quot;, collaborated with &quot;The Big Chill&quot; to break a Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Amount of Zombies Captured on Camera&quot;. 4,206 people showed up for the event, breaking the record for any previous gatherings recorded by Guinness. The unreleased film is currently being re-developed as a potential six-part TV series for E4.

<text>The Big Chill is a 1983 American comedy-drama film directed by Lawrence Kasdan, starring an ensemble cast consisting of Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, and JoBeth Williams. The plot focuses on a group of baby boomers who attended the University of Michigan, reuniting after 12 years when their friend Alex committed suicide.

It was filmed in Beaufort, South Carolina.

The soundtrack features soul, R&amp;B, and pop-rock music from the 1960s and 1970s, including tracks by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, the Rolling Stones, and Three Dog Night.

&quot;The Big Chill&quot; was adapted for television as the short-lived series &quot;Hometown&quot;. Later, it influenced the TV series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;A Million Little Things&quot;.

==Plot==
After Alex Marshall committed suicide, his fellow University of Michigan alumni and close friends attend his funeral at the Tidalholm plantation in Beaufort, South Carolina. During the visit, everyone stays with Sarah and Harold Cooper.

His other friends include Sam Weber, a television actor; Meg Jones, once a public defender and now a real-estate attorney; Michael Gold, a journalist for &quot;People&quot; magazine; former talk-radio psychologist Nick Carlton, now an impotent Vietnam vet with a drug addiction; and Karen Bowen, an unfulfilled writer unhappily married to Richard, a conservative advertising executive. Also present is Chloe, Alex&#x27;s girlfriend of four months who is much younger than Alex and had been living with him in Sarah and Harold’s basement.

While out jogging early the next morning Harold, violating SEC rules, tells Nick that a large corporation is about to buy his small company, which will make him rich and triple the value of the stock. He told Alex, making it possible for him to buy property in the area.

Harold suggests Nick use the tip to get into a new line of work. During their conversation, it is revealed that Sarah and Alex had a brief affair five years earlier, which all the friends knew about. Nick comforts Harold by reminding him she did not marry Alex. Harold, Sarah, and Alex moved past it, but Sarah tells Karen her friendship with Alex was harmed by the affair.

Richard goes home the next day, but Karen stays. Harold, Nick, Michael, and Chloe drive out to see the old house that Chloe and Alex were renovating. Meanwhile, Meg tells Sarah she is fed up with failed relationships and intends to have a child on her own. Believing she is ovulating, she plans to ask Sam to be the father of her child. (She approaches Nick first, only to discover she&#x27;s the last to know about his impotency.)

Michael, who continually flirts with Chloe, needs investors for a New York nightclub. At dinner, Sarah becomes tearful and wonders if their fervent &#x27;60s idealism was &quot;just fashion.&quot; Later that night, Meg approaches Sam, but he declines, feeling fatherhood is too great a responsibility as he already has an estranged child. Nick shares his drugs, with varying effects.

The next day, Harold, a running shoe entrepreneur, gives everyone a pair. Nick goes to the old house and sits on the porch for hours, missing the Michigan football game. Michael offers to sire Meg&#x27;s child, alluding to their one-time college encounter.

During a halftime game of touch football, a local police officer escorts a sullen Nick back to the house after he runs a red light and becomes belligerent. Recognizing Sam, the officer offers to drop charges if he will hop into Nick&#x27;s Porsche 911 the way his J. T. Lancer character does on TV. He tries but fails, injuring himself slightly. Nick angers Harold by accusing him of being friendly with cops. Harold chastises Nick, reminding him that this is his home and Nick&#x27;s recklessness could put his reputation in danger.

Karen tells a surprised Sam that she is in love with him and wants to leave Richard. He tells her his first marriage failed because of boredom and he does not want her to make the same mistake. Feeling led on, Karen angrily stomps off.

Meg tells Sarah that Michael is the wrong choice. Sarah observes the warm phone conversation between her young daughter and Meg. Later, the group, confused over Alex&#x27;s death, regrets losing touch with him. To everyone but Sam, it seems that Alex withdrew deliberately. Nick is particularly cynical and bitter about life, love, and friendship.

Karen follows Sam outside to mollify him, and they have sex. Sarah pulls Harold aside, embracing him, telling him she has a favor to ask: &quot;It&#x27;s about Meg...&quot; Meg goes to him and they make love, tenderly. Chloe asks Nick to spend the night in the room she shared with Alex.

The next morning, Harold announces that Nick and Chloe will stay on to renovate the old house. Karen packs to return home to Richard. Michael ditches his nightclub plans. Nick shows everyone an old column that Michael wrote about Alex declining a prestigious fellowship. As the friends prepare to depart, Michael jokingly tells the Coopers they have taken a secret vote: They are never leaving.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to a Newsday article, Lawrence Kasdan and Barbara Benedek began writing &quot;The Big Chill&quot; in September 1980, five months after the release of &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; They wrote the screenplay as a semi-autobiographical story inspired by their optimistic political activism while attending college in the 1960s and then their disillusionment at society in the 1970s. While attending the University of Michigan, Kasdan lived at the Eugene V. Debs Cooperative House in the late 1960s, and his experiences at the co-op informed the direction of the screenplay. Many of the characters were based on his housemates, and the ways in which they cook communal meals and share their house echo the culture of Ann Arbor cooperatives. Kasdan and Benedek worked on the screenplay as Kasdan was directing &quot;Body Heat.&quot; While the other characters in the film weren&#x27;t written with any specific actors in mind, Kasdan wrote the role of “Nick” for &quot;Body Heat&quot;’s star, William Hurt, who gave Kasdan a commitment to do &quot;The Big Chill&quot;.

Kasdan first pitched the story to The Ladd Company but was rejected. Richard Fischoff unsuccessfully tried to convince Paramount Pictures to film the screenplay after reading it in the summer of 1982. When this failed he turned the screenplay to Marcia Nasatir, who had recently departed her executive positions at United Artists and Orion Pictures to cofound Carson Productions with Johnny Carson. Fischoff convinced Nasatir to finance the film as the studio&#x27;s first production, and took over as supervising producer after she left the studio to work at 20th Century Fox.

Production on the film began on November 8, 1982, in Atlanta. Filming primarily took place at the Edgar Fripp House (called &quot;Tidalholm&quot;) in downtown Beaufort, South Carolina, where the film was set.

Kasdan&#x27;s wife Meg was placed in charge of compiling period-appropriate songs for the soundtrack. She heard &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; for the first time in many years while picking her son up at camp, listening to a Marvin Gaye cassette, and was struck by how the song with no dialogue would make a perfect start to the film.

It was decided before filming that &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; by The Temptations would be used for the cleanup after dinner scene, so the cast were given headphones so that they could hear the song during filming, making it easier for them to keep the beat.

JoBeth Williams recalled filming a scene flashing back to the characters in 1968. &quot;It was just wonderful to shoot&quot;, she said. &quot;They rented this big house in Atlanta and installed bead curtains, rock posters, incense, 1968 &quot;Life&quot; magazines—it was a real time warp.&quot; Williams says that, in the scene, her character was living with William Hurt&#x27;s character and ignoring Tom Berenger&#x27;s. The Alex character, played by Kevin Costner &quot;looking like a scruffy James Dean&quot;, was also in the scene. &quot;That turned out to be the problem... Nobody could live up to that role after the build-up through the film, and audiences said they didn&#x27;t want to see anybody try. So the last 10 minutes of the film were just cut out.&quot; Filming concluded on February 7, 1983.

According to Kasdan, it was his decision to axe the scenes which were to appear at the end of the film as a flashback. “It didn’t work,” he said in an interview with the Toronto &quot;Star&quot;. “I felt so bad about it.” Costner was given a role in Kasdan&#x27;s next film, the 1985 western &quot;Silverado&quot;, as Jake, the younger brother of Emmett, played by Scott Glenn, alongside fellow &quot;Big Chill&quot; cast member Kevin Kline, who played Paden.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on reviews from 42 critics, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;&quot;The Big Chill&quot; captures a generation&#x27;s growing ennui with a terrific cast, a handful of perceptive insights, and one of the decade&#x27;s best film soundtracks.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

At the time, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; described &quot;The Big Chill&quot; as a &quot;funny and ferociously smart movie&quot;, stating:

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film was a &quot;very accomplished, serious comedy&quot; and an &quot;unusually good choice to open this year&#x27;s [New York Film Festival] in that it represents the best of mainstream American film making.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, observing &quot;&quot;The Big Chill&quot; is a splendid technical exercise. It has all the right moves. It knows all the right words. Its characters have all the right clothes, expressions, fears, lusts, and ambitions. But there&#x27;s no payoff and it doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere. I thought at first that was a weakness of the movie. There also is the possibility that it&#x27;s the movie&#x27;s message.&quot;

The film was parodied by T. Coraghessan Boyle in his short story &quot;The Little Chill&quot;. The story begins &quot;Hal had known Rob and Irene, Jill, Harvey, Tottle, and Pesky since elementary school, and they were all 40 going on 60.&quot;

==Accolades==
In 2004, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; finished #94 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs poll.

==Soundtracks==
Ten of the songs from the film were released on the soundtrack album; four additional songs not from the film were added to the original CD release as &quot;additional classics from the era&quot;. The rest of the film&#x27;s songs (aside from the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;), as well as the &quot;additional classics&quot; from the original soundtrack CD were released in 1984 on a second soundtrack album, titled &quot;More Songs from the Big Chill&quot;. Both albums were re-mastered in 1998; the track list of the first album mirrored the original LP, without the &quot;additional classics&quot;. In 2004, Hip-O Records released a Deluxe edition, containing 16 of the 18 songs from the film (again excluding &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; and newly omitting &quot;Quicksilver Girl&quot; by the Steve Miller Band) and three additional film instrumentals. A second &quot;music of a generation&quot; disc of 19 additional tracks was included as well. Some of those tracks had appeared on the &quot;More Songs&quot; release.

<text>Andrew Newell Wyeth ( ; July 12, 1917 – January 16, 2009) was an American visual artist and one of the best-known American artists of the middle 20th century. Though he considered himself to be an &quot;abstractionist,&quot; Wyeth was primarily a realist painter who worked in a regionalist style, often painting the land and people of his hometown in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and his summer home in Cushing, Maine. 

His father, the illustrator and artist N. C. Wyeth, was a key member of the Brandywine School of artists and illustrators. N.C. Wyeth gave Andrew art lessons as a child, during which he developed the skills to create landscapes, illustrations, figures, and watercolor paintings. His influences included the landscape artist Winslow Homer, American philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau, and filmmaker King Vidor. Wyeth&#x27;s wife, Betsy, managed his career and was a strong influence in his work. His son Jamie Wyeth is also an artist. 

One of the best-known images in 20th-century American art is his 1948 tempera painting &quot;Christina&#x27;s World&quot;, currently in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He is also known for &quot;The Helga Pictures&quot; and his paintings of windows. In addition to being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1988&quot;,&quot; Wyeth was the first painter to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the first American artist since John Singer Sargent to be elected to the French Académie des Beaux-Arts, and the first living United States artist to be elected to Britain&#x27;s Royal Academy.

==Biography==

===Childhood===

Andrew was the youngest of the five children of illustrator and artist Newell Convers (N. C.) Wyeth and his wife, Carolyn Bockius Wyeth. He was born July 12, 1917, on the 100th anniversary of Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s birth. Due to N. C. &#x27;s fond appreciation of Henry David Thoreau, he found this both coincidental and exciting. N. C. was an attentive father, fostering each of the children&#x27;s interests and talents. The family was close, spending time reading together, taking walks, fostering &quot;a closeness with nature&quot; and developing a feeling for Wyeth family history.

Andrew was home-tutored because of his frail health. Like his father, the young Wyeth read and appreciated the poetry of Robert Frost and the writings of Henry David Thoreau and studied their relationships with nature. Music and movies also heightened his artistic sensitivity. One major influence, discussed at length by Wyeth himself, was King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1925). He claimed to have seen the film, which depicted family dynamics similar to his own, &quot;a hundred-and-eighty-times&quot; and believed it had the greatest influence on his work. Vidor later made a documentary, &quot;The Metaphor&quot;, where he and Wyeth discuss the influence of the film on his paintings, including &quot;Winter 1946&quot;, &quot;Snow Flurries&quot;, &quot;Portrait of Ralph Kline&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Flight of a Boy up a Tree.&quot;

Wyeth&#x27;s father was the only teacher that he had. Due to being schooled at home, he led both a sheltered life and one that was &quot;obsessively focused&quot;. Wyeth recalled of that time: &quot;Pa kept me almost in a jail, just kept me to himself in my own world, and he wouldn&#x27;t let anyone in on it. I was almost made to stay in Robin Hood&#x27;s Sherwood Forest with Maid Marion and the rebels.&quot;

N. C. Wyeth was an illustrator known for his work in magazines, posters and advertisements. He created illustrations for books such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. By the 1920s, Wyeth senior had become a celebrity, and the family often had celebrities as guests, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Mary Pickford. The home bustled with creative activity and competition. N. C. and Carolyn&#x27;s five children were all talented. Henriette Wyeth Hurd, the eldest, became a painter of portraits and still lifes. Carolyn Wyeth, the second child, was also a painter. Nathaniel Wyeth, the third child, was a successful inventor. Ann was a musician at a young age and became a composer as an adult. Andrew was the youngest child.

===N. C. Wyeth&#x27;s guidance===
Wyeth started drawing at a young age. He was a draftsman before he could read. By the time he was a teenager, his father, N. C. Wyeth, brought him into his studio for the only art lessons he ever had and inspired his son&#x27;s love of rural landscapes, sense of romance, and artistic traditions. Although creating illustrations was not a passion he wished to pursue, Wyeth produced illustrations under his father&#x27;s name while in his teens.

With his father&#x27;s guidance, he mastered figure study and watercolor, and later learned egg tempera from his brother-in-law Peter Hurd. He studied art history on his own, admiring many masters of Renaissance and American painting, especially Winslow Homer.

N. C. also fostered an inner self-confidence to follow one&#x27;s own talents without thought of how the work is received. N. C. wrote in a letter to Wyeth in 1944:

In the same letter, N. C. correlates being a great person with being a great painter: To be a great artist, he described, requires emotional depth, an openness to look beyond self to the subject, and passion. A great painting then is one that enriches and broadens one&#x27;s perspective.

In October 1945, his father and his three-year-old nephew, Newell Convers Wyeth II (b. 1941), were killed when their car stalled on railroad tracks near their home and was struck by a train. Wyeth referred to his father&#x27;s death as a formative emotional event in his artistic career, in addition to being a personal tragedy. Shortly afterwards, Wyeth&#x27;s art consolidated into his mature and enduring style.

===Marriage and children===
On May 15, 1940, Wyeth married Betsy James, whom he met in 1939 in Maine. Christina Olson, who was to become the model for &quot;Christina&#x27;s World&quot;, met Wyeth through an introduction by Betsy. Betsy had an influence on Andrew as strong as that of his father, such that N. C. Wyeth began to resent her. She played an important role managing his career. She was once quoted as saying, &quot;I am a director and I had the greatest actor in the world.&quot;
The couple had two sons. Nicholas was born in 1943. Jamie Wyeth, born in 1946, followed his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s footsteps, becoming the third generation of Wyeth artists. Andrew painted portraits of both children (&quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Faraway&quot; of Jamie). Andrew was the role model and teacher to his son Jamie that his father, N. C., had been to him. The artistic history is told in James H. Duff&#x27;s &quot;An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art&quot;.

===Death===
On January 16, 2009, Andrew Wyeth died in his sleep in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, after a brief illness. He was 91 years old.
His wife Betsy died on April 21, 2020, at the age of 98.

==Work==

Inspired by Winslow Homer&#x27;s watercolors, Wyeth painted an impressionistic watercolor, &quot;Coot Hunter&quot;, about 1933. There he experimented with the &quot;fleeting effects of light and movement&quot;. In 1937, at age twenty, Wyeth had his first one-man exhibition of watercolors at the Macbeth Gallery in New York City. The entire inventory of paintings sold out, and his life path seemed certain. His style was different from his father&#x27;s: more spare, &quot;drier,&quot; and more limited in color range. He stated his belief that &quot;the great danger of the Pyle school is picture-making.&quot; He did some book illustrations in his early career, but not to the extent that N. C. Wyeth did. &quot;Public Sale&quot; (1943, Philadelphia Museum of Art), is one of his first tempera paintings.

Wyeth was a visual artist, primarily classified as a realist painter, like Winslow Homer or Thomas Eakins. In a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article in 1965, Wyeth said that although he was thought of as a realist, he thought of himself as an abstractionist: &quot;My people, my objects breathe in a different way: there&#x27;s another core—an excitement that&#x27;s definitely abstract. My God, when you really begin to peer into something, a simple object, and realize the profound meaning of that thing—if you have an emotion about it, there&#x27;s no end.&quot; Some feel Wyeth&#x27;s work went against modernist ideals by embodying middle-class values, but this caused conversations about his work to extend beyond painting to social class.

He worked predominantly in a regionalist style. In his art, Wyeth&#x27;s favorite subjects were the land and people around him, both in his hometown of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and at his summer home in Cushing, Maine. In 1958, Andrew and Betsy Wyeth purchased and restored &quot;The Mill&quot;, a group of 18th-century buildings that appeared often in his work, including &quot;Night Sleeper &quot;(1979, private collection). Brinton&#x27;s Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Dividing his time between Pennsylvania and Maine, Wyeth maintained a realist painting style for over seventy years. He gravitated to several identifiable landscape subjects and models. His solitary walks were the primary means of inspiration for his landscapes. He developed an extraordinary intimacy with the land and sea and strove for a spiritual understanding based on history and unspoken emotion. He typically created dozens of studies on a subject in pencil or loosely brushed watercolor before executing a finished painting, either in watercolor, drybrush (a watercolor style in which the water is squeezed from the brush), or egg tempera. &quot;Ring Road&quot; (1985) reflects the earth tones that Wyeth used throughout his career. &quot;Raven&#x27;s Grove&quot; (1985) is a prime example of Wyeth&#x27;s mastery of egg tempera and his evolution as an artist.

After N. C. Wyeth&#x27;s death, his work began to take on a melancholic tone. Wyeth painted &quot;Winter 1946 &quot;(1946, North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh, 1946), which depicts a neighbor boy, Allan Lynch, running aimlessly down a bleak hill, his hand reaching out. The location of the work was the other side of the hill where his father had died and represented the unsettling, free-falling sense of loss.

===Christina Olson and the Olson Farm===

It was at the Olson farm in Cushing, Maine, that he painted &quot;Christina&#x27;s World&quot; (1948). Perhaps his best known work, it depicts his neighbor, Christina Olson, sprawled on a dry field facing her house in the distance. Wyeth was inspired by Christina, who, crippled from (undiagnosed) Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a genetic polyneuropathy, and unable to walk, spent most of her time at home.

The Olson house has been preserved and renovated to match its appearance in &quot;Christina&#x27;s World&quot;. It is open to the public as a part of the Farnsworth Art Museum. After being introduced to the Olsons by Betsy James, Wyeth built a friendship with the siblings and was soon allowed full roam of the farm and house where he did a number of works and studies of the Olson House and property. Because of Wyeth&#x27;s profile, the property was designated a National Historic Landmark in June 2011.

===Kuerner Farm===

Wyeth began painting Anna and Karl Kuerner, his neighbors in Chadds Ford. Like the Olsons, the Kuerners and their farm were one of Wyeth&#x27;s most important subjects for nearly 30 years. He stated about the Kuerner Farm, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it a picturesque place. It just excited me, purely abstractly and purely emotionally.&quot; &quot;Brown Swiss &quot; (1957, private collection) is one of many paintings that he made from the 1950s to the 1970s of Karl and Anna Kuerner&#x27;s farm in Chadds Ford. While the painting is named after the Brown Swiss cows Karl Kuerner owned, it shows the Kuerner farmhouse and the reflection of the house in the farm pond. However, Wyeth ultimately decided not to include any cows in the painting; only their tracks in the grass remain.

Chadds Ford contained a small enclave of African-Americans known as &quot;Little Africa.&quot; The community settled around Mother Archie&#x27;s Church, a Quaker schoolhouse converted to a house of worship. Andrew Wyeth painted the church in several landscapes during its active period, and the abandoned building walls appear in Ring Road (1985). African-American residents of Little Africa appear as recurring models for Wyeth&#x27;s paintings. The Kuerner Farm is available to tour through the Brandywine River Museum, as is the nearby N. C. Wyeth House and Studio; in 2011, the farm was declared a National Historic Landmark, based on its association with Wyeth.

===Helga paintings===
In 1986, extensive coverage was given to the revelation of a series of 247 studies of the German-born Helga Testorf, whom Wyeth met while she was attending to Karl Kuerner at his farm. Wyeth painted her over the period 1971 to 1985 without the knowledge of either his wife or Helga&#x27;s husband, John Testorf. Helga, a caregiver with nursing experience, had never modeled before but quickly became comfortable with the long periods of posing, during which he observed and painted her in intimate detail. The Helga pictures are not an obvious psychological study of the subject, but more an extensive study of her physical landscape set within Wyeth&#x27;s customary landscapes. She is nearly always portrayed as unsmiling and passive; yet, within those deliberate limitations, Wyeth manages to convey subtle qualities of character and mood, as he does in many of his best portraits. This extensive study of one subject in differing contexts and emotional states is unique in American art.

In 1986, Philadelphia publisher and millionaire Leonard E.B. Andrews (1925–2009) purchased almost the entire collection, preserving it intact. Wyeth had already given a few Helga paintings to friends, including the famous &quot;Lovers&quot;, which had been given as a gift to Wyeth&#x27;s wife.

The works were exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in 1987 and in a nationwide tour. There was extensive criticism of both the 1987 exhibition and the subsequent tour. The show was &quot;lambasted&quot; as an &quot;absurd error&quot; by John Russell and an &quot;essentially tasteless endeavor&quot; by Jack Flam, coming to be viewed by some people as &quot;a traumatic event for the museum.&quot; The curator, Neil Harris, labeled the show &quot;the most polarizing National Gallery exhibition of the late 1980s,&quot; himself admitting concern over &quot;the voyeuristic aura of the Helga exhibition.&quot;

The tour was criticized after the fact because, after it ended, the pictures&#x27; owner sold his entire cache to a Japanese company, a transaction characterized by Christopher Benfey as &quot;crass.&quot;

In a 2007 interview, when Wyeth was asked if Helga was going to be present at his 90th birthday party, he said &quot;Yeah, certainly. Oh, absolutely,&quot; and went on to say, &quot;She&#x27;s part of the family now. I know it shocks everyone. That&#x27;s what I love about it. It really shocks &#x27;em.&quot;

===Window paintings===

Wyeth created about 300 works of art—drawings and paintings of tempora and watercolor—of windows. His son, Jaime, stated that his father was &quot;obsessed with windows&quot;. In 2014, the National Gallery of Art held an exhibition, &quot;Andrew Wyeth: Looking Out, Looking In&quot;, of 60 works of art that depict windows, such as &quot;Wind from the Sea&quot; (1947), &quot;Spring Fed&quot; (1967), &quot;Off at Sea&quot; (1972), and &quot;Rod and Reel&quot; (1975). &quot;Wind from the Sea&quot; depicts a breeze entering a window on the upper floor of the Olson house. It is an example of non-figurative portraiture and was a favorite of the poet Robert Frost.

Made in Cushing, Maine and Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania over decades, the works showcase his growth as an artist. The National Gallery of Art states that the windows artwork &quot;offer[s] the clearest understanding of Wyeth&#x27;s creative process&quot; because his paintings of people inspire questions about who the person is and what they are doing. Without the distraction of figures, the viewer is better able to assess the use of &quot;symbolism, light, color, lines and shapes.&quot;

Wyeth illustrated different perspectives, like works of windows seen through windows, flowing curtains, and life outside the windows. Of &quot;Wind from the Sea&quot;, Wyeth said of his summer at Olson farm, 
===Portraits===

Wyeth began to add portraits in the 1960s, such as &quot;Up in the Studio&quot; (1965), a drybrush portrait of his sister Carolyn. &quot;Garret Room&quot;, a painting of Wyeth&#x27;s friend Tom Clark, (1962, private collection) was begun in watercolor and finished with the drybrush technique. &quot;Adam&quot; (1963, Brandywine Museum), is a tempera painting of a neighbor, Adam Johnson, who lived near Wyeth.

In works such as &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1964), a portrait of Ralph Cline, Wyeth looked beyond the surface to understand who he was painting. Cline was an interesting gentleman 71 years of age, of Native American heritage and Maine humor. He wore a big hat and overalls and chewed tobacco. It was through painting him, though, that Wyeth understood that, beneath his humor and hard countenance, Cline was a warm-hearted veteran of great dignity and intellect.

When Christina Olson died in the winter of 1969, Wyeth refocused his artistic attention upon Siri Erickson, capturing her naked innocence in &quot;The Sauna&quot;. It was a prelude to the Helga paintings.

&quot;Maidenhair&quot; (1974, Andrew and Betsy Wyeth collection), a tempera painting of a lone female figure sitting in a church pew at the Old German Meeting House in Waldoboro, Maine. It is a companion piece to &quot;Crown of Flowers&quot;.

===Critical reaction===
Wyeth&#x27;s art has long been controversial. He developed technically beautiful works, had a large following and accrued a considerable fortune as a result. Yet critics, curators and historians have offered conflicting views about the importance of his work. Art historian Robert Rosenblum was asked in 1977 to identify the &quot;most overrated and underrated&quot; artists of the 20th century. He provided one name for both categories: Andrew Wyeth.

Admirers of Wyeth&#x27;s art believe that his paintings, in addition to their pictorial formal beauty, contain strong emotional currents, symbolic content, and underlying abstraction. Most observers of his art agree that he is skilled at handling the medium of egg tempera (which uses egg yolk as its medium) and watercolor. Wyeth avoided using oil paints. His use of light and shadow lets the subjects illuminate the canvas. His paintings and titles suggest sound, as is implied in many paintings, including &quot;Distant Thunder&quot; (1961) and &quot;Spring Fed&quot; (1967). &quot;Christina&#x27;s World&quot; became an iconic image, a status unmet to even the best paintings, &quot;that registers as an emotional and cultural reference point in the minds of millions.&quot;

Wyeth created work in sharp contrast to abstraction, which gained currency in American art and critical thinking in the middle of the 20th century.

Museum exhibitions of Wyeth&#x27;s paintings have set attendance records, but many art critics have evaluated his work less favorably. Peter Schjeldahl, art critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, derided his paintings as &quot;Formulaic stuff, not very effective even as illustrational &#x27;realism&#x27;.&quot; Some found Wyeth&#x27;s art of rural subject matter tired and oversweet.

N. C. advised Wyeth to work from one&#x27;s own perspective and imagination; to work for &quot;effect&quot; means the artist is not fully exploring their artistic abilities and, as a result, the artist will not realize their potential.

===Museum collections===
Wyeth&#x27;s work is held in the following permanent collections:
* The collections of most major American museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the National Gallery of Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Cincinnati Art Museum; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City; the Arkansas Art Center in Little Rock; and the Muscarelle Museum of Art in Williamsburg, VA. President George W. Bush and Laura Bush decorated a room of the White House in Washington, D.C., with Wyeth paintings from their collection.
* Especially large collections of the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine; and the Greenville County Museum of Art in Greenville, South Carolina.
* Museum collections throughout the world, including the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo; the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg; the Palazzo Reale in Milan; and the Académie des Beaux Arts in Paris, among many other museums.

<text>Relief is a sculptural method in which the sculpted pieces remain attached to a solid background of the same material. The term &quot;&quot; is from the Latin verb , to raise (lit. to lift back). To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background plane. When a relief is carved into a flat surface of stone (relief sculpture) or wood (relief carving), the field is actually lowered, leaving the unsculpted areas seeming higher. The approach requires a lot of chiselling away of the background, which takes a long time. On the other hand, a relief saves forming the rear of a subject, and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round, especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point, particularly in stone. In other materials such as metal, clay, plaster stucco, ceramics or papier-mâché the form can be simply added to or raised up from the background. Monumental bronze reliefs are made by casting.

There are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field, for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English. The full range includes high relief (Italian , French ), where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas, mid-relief (Italian ), low relief (Italian , French: ), and shallow-relief (Italian ), where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements. There is also sunk relief, which was mainly restricted to Ancient Egypt (&quot;see below&quot;). However, the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important, and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work.

The definition of these terms is somewhat variable, and many works combine areas in more than one of them, rarely sliding between them in a single figure; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions. The opposite of relief sculpture is counter-relief, , or , where the form is cut into the field or background rather than rising from it; this is very rare in monumental sculpture. Hyphens may or may not be used in all these terms, though they are rarely seen in &quot;sunk relief&quot; and are usual in &quot;&quot; and &quot;counter-relief&quot;. Works in the technique are described as &quot;in relief&quot;, and, especially in monumental sculpture, the work itself is &quot;a relief&quot;.

Reliefs are common throughout the world on the walls of buildings and a variety of smaller settings, and a sequence of several panels or sections of relief may represent an extended narrative. Relief is more suitable for depicting complicated subjects with many figures and very active poses, such as battles, than free-standing &quot;sculpture in the round&quot;. Most ancient architectural reliefs were originally painted, which helped to define forms in low relief. The subject of reliefs is for convenient reference assumed in this article to be usually figures, but sculpture in relief often depicts decorative geometrical or foliage patterns, as in the arabesques of Islamic art, and may be of any subject.

Rock reliefs are those carved into solid rock in the open air (if inside caves, whether natural or human-made, they are more likely to be called &quot;rock-cut&quot;). This type is found in many cultures, in particular those of the Ancient Near East and Buddhist countries. A stele is a single standing stone; many of these carry reliefs.

==Types==

The distinction between high and low relief is somewhat subjective, and the two are very often combined in a single work. In particular, most later &quot;high reliefs&quot; contain sections in low relief, usually in the background. From the Parthenon Frieze onwards, many single figures in large monumental sculpture have heads in high relief, but their lower legs are in low relief. The slightly projecting figures created in this way work well in reliefs that are seen from below, and reflect that the heads of figures are usually of more interest to both artist and viewer than the legs or feet. As unfinished examples from various periods show, raised reliefs, whether high or low, were normally &quot;blocked out&quot; by marking the outline of the figure and reducing the background areas to the new background level, work no doubt performed by apprentices (see gallery).

===Low relief or bas-relief===

A low relief is a projecting image with a shallow overall depth, for example used on coins, on which all images are in low relief. In the lowest reliefs the relative depth of the elements shown is completely distorted, and if seen from the side the image makes no sense, but from the front the small variations in depth register as a three-dimensional image. Other versions distort depth much less. The term comes from the Italian via the French (), both meaning &quot;low relief&quot;. The former is now a very old-fashioned term in English, and the latter term is becoming so.

Low relief is a technique which requires less work, and is therefore cheaper to produce, as less of the background needs to be removed in a carving, or less modelling is required. In the art of Ancient Egypt, Assyrian palace reliefs, and other ancient Near Eastern and Asian cultures, a consistent very low relief was commonly used for the whole composition. These images would usually be painted after carving, which helped define the forms; today the paint has worn off in the great majority of surviving examples, but minute, invisible remains of paint can usually be discovered through chemical means.
The Ishtar Gate of Babylon, now in Berlin, has low reliefs of large animals formed from moulded bricks, glazed in colour. Plaster, which made the technique far easier, was widely used in Egypt and the Near East from antiquity into Islamic times (latterly for architectural decoration, as at the Alhambra), Rome, and Europe from at least the Renaissance, as well as probably elsewhere. However, it needs very good conditions to survive long in unmaintained buildings – Roman decorative plasterwork is mainly known from Pompeii and other sites buried by ash from Mount Vesuvius. Low relief was relatively rare in Western medieval art, but may be found, for example in wooden figures or scenes on the insides of the folding wings of multi-panel altarpieces.

The revival of low relief, which was seen as a classical style, begins early in the Renaissance; the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, a pioneering classicist building, designed by Leon Battista Alberti around 1450, uses low reliefs by Agostino di Duccio inside and on the external walls. Since the Renaissance plaster has been very widely used for indoor ornamental work such as cornices and ceilings, but in the 16th century it was used for large figures (many also using high relief) at the Chateau of Fontainebleau, which were imitated more crudely elsewhere, for example in the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall.

Shallow-relief, in Italian or (&quot;squashed relief&quot;), is a very shallow relief, which merges into engraving in places, and can be hard to read in photographs. It is often used for the background areas of compositions with the main elements in low-relief, but its use over a whole (usually rather small) piece was effectively invented and perfected by the Italian Renaissance sculptor Donatello.

In later Western art, until a 20th-century revival, low relief was used mostly for smaller works or combined with higher relief to convey a sense of distance, or to give depth to the composition, especially for scenes with many figures and a landscape or architectural background, in the same way that lighter colours are used for the same purpose in painting. Thus figures in the foreground are sculpted in high-relief, those in the background in low-relief. Low relief may use any medium or technique of sculpture, stone carving and metal casting being most common. Large architectural compositions all in low relief saw a revival in the 20th century, being popular on buildings in Art Deco and related styles, which borrowed from the ancient low reliefs now available in museums. Some sculptors, including Eric Gill, have adopted the &quot;squashed&quot; depth of low relief in works that are actually free-standing.

===Mid-relief===
Mid-relief, &quot;half-relief&quot; or is somewhat imprecisely defined, and the term is not often used in English, the works usually being described as low relief instead. The typical traditional definition is that only up to half of the subject projects, and no elements are undercut or fully disengaged from the background field. The depth of the elements shown is normally somewhat distorted.

Mid-relief is probably the most common type of relief found in the Hindu and Buddhist art of India and Southeast Asia. The low to mid-reliefs of 2nd-century BCE to 6th-century CE Ajanta Caves and 5th- to 10th-century Ellora Caves in India are rock reliefs. Most of these reliefs are used to narrate sacred scriptures, such as the 1,460 panels of the 9th-century Borobudur temple in Central Java, Indonesia, narrating the Jataka tales or lives of the Buddha. Other examples are low reliefs narrating the Ramayana Hindu epic in Prambanan temple, also in Java, in Cambodia, the temples of Angkor, with scenes including the Samudra manthan or &quot;Churning the Ocean of Milk&quot; at the 12th-century Angkor Wat, and reliefs of apsaras. At Bayon temple in Angkor Thom there are scenes of daily life in the Khmer Empire.

===High relief===
High relief (or , from Italian) is where in general more than half the mass of the sculpted figure projects from the background. Indeed, the most prominent elements of the composition, especially heads and limbs, are often completely undercut, detaching them from the field. The parts of the subject that are seen are normally depicted at their full depth, unlike low relief where the elements seen are &quot;squashed&quot; flatter. High relief thus uses essentially the same style and techniques as free-standing sculpture, and in the case of a single figure gives largely the same view as a person standing directly in front of a free-standing statue would have. All cultures and periods in which large sculptures were created used this technique in monumental sculpture and architecture.

Most of the many grand figure reliefs in Ancient Greek sculpture used a very &quot;high&quot; version of high relief, with elements often fully free of the background, and parts of figures crossing over each other to indicate depth. The metopes of the Parthenon have largely lost their fully rounded elements, except for heads, showing the advantages of relief in terms of durability. High relief has remained the dominant form for reliefs with figures in Western sculpture, also being common in Indian temple sculpture. Smaller Greek sculptures such as private tombs, and smaller decorative areas such as friezes on large buildings, more often used low relief.

Hellenistic and Roman sarcophagus reliefs were cut with a drill rather than chisels, enabling and encouraging compositions extremely crowded with figures, like the Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus (250–260 CE). These are also seen in the enormous strips of reliefs that wound around Roman triumphal columns. The sarcophagi in particular exerted a huge influence on later Western sculpture. The European Middle Ages tended to use high relief for all purposes in stone, though like Ancient Roman sculpture, their reliefs were typically not as high as in Ancient Greece. Very high relief re-emerged in the Renaissance, and was especially used in wall-mounted funerary art and later on Neoclassical pediments and public monuments.

In the Buddhist and Hindu art of India and Southeast Asia, high relief can also be found, although it is not as common as low to mid-reliefs. Famous examples of Indian high reliefs can be found at the Khajuraho temples, with voluptuous, twisting figures that often illustrate the erotic Kamasutra positions. In the 9th-century Prambanan temple, Central Java, high reliefs of Lokapala devatas, the guardians of deities of the directions, are found.

The largest high relief sculpture in the world is the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial in the U.S. state of Georgia, which was cut 42 feet deep into the mountain, and measures 90 feet in height, 190 feet in width, and lies 400 feet above the ground.

===Sunk relief===
Sunk or sunken relief is largely restricted to the art of Ancient Egypt where it is very common, becoming after the Amarna period of Ahkenaten the dominant type used, as opposed to low relief. It had been used earlier, but mainly for large reliefs on external walls, and for hieroglyphs and cartouches. The image is made by cutting the relief sculpture itself into a flat surface to enhance the impression of three-dimensionality. In a simpler form, the images are usually mostly linear in nature, like hieroglyphs, but in most cases the figure itself is in low relief, but set within a sunken area shaped round the image, so that the relief never rises beyond the original flat surface. In some cases the figures and other elements are in a very low relief that does not rise to the original surface, but others are modeled more fully, with some areas rising to the original surface. This method minimizes the work removing the background, while allowing normal relief modelling.

The technique is most successful with strong sunlight to emphasise the outlines and forms by shadow, as no attempt was made to soften the edge of the sunk area, leaving a face at a right-angle to the surface all around it. Some reliefs, especially funerary monuments with heads or busts from ancient Rome and later Western art, leave a &quot;frame&quot; at the original level around the edge of the relief, or place a head in a hemispherical recess in the block (see Roman example in gallery). Though essentially very similar to Egyptian sunk relief, but with a background space at the lower level around the figure, the term would not normally be used of such works.

It is also used for carving letters (typically &quot;om mani padme hum&quot;) in the mani stones of Tibetan Buddhism.

===Counter-relief===
Sunk relief technique is not to be confused with &quot;counter-relief&quot; or intaglio as seen on engraved gem seals – where an image is fully modeled in a &quot;negative&quot; manner. The image goes into the surface, so that when impressed on wax it gives an impression in normal relief. However many engraved gems were carved in cameo or normal relief.

A few very late Hellenistic monumental carvings in Egypt use full &quot;negative&quot; modelling as though on a gem seal, perhaps as sculptors trained in the Greek tradition attempted to use traditional Egyptian conventions.

===Small objects===

Small-scale reliefs have been carved in various materials, notably ivory, wood, and wax. Reliefs are often found in decorative arts such as ceramics and metalwork; these are less often described as &quot;reliefs&quot; than as &quot;in relief&quot;. Small bronze reliefs are often in the form of &quot;plaques&quot; or plaquettes, which may be set in furniture or framed, or just kept as they are, a popular form for European collectors, especially in the Renaissance.

Various modelling techniques are used, such repoussé (&quot;pushed-back&quot;) in metalwork, where a thin metal plate is shaped from behind using various metal or wood punches, producing a relief image. Casting has also been widely used in bronze and other metals. Casting and repoussé are often used in concert in to speed up production and add greater detail to the final relief. In stone, as well as engraved gems, larger hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones have been highly prestigious since ancient times in many Eurasian cultures. Reliefs in wax were produced at least from the Renaissance.

Carved ivory reliefs have been used since ancient times, and because the material, though expensive, cannot usually be reused, they have a relatively high survival rate, and for example consular diptychs represent a large proportion of the survivals of portable secular art from Late Antiquity. In the Gothic period the carving of ivory reliefs became a considerable luxury industry in Paris and other centres. As well as small diptychs and triptychs with densely packed religious scenes, usually from the New Testament, secular objects, usually in a lower relief, were also produced.

These were often round mirror-cases, combs, handles, and other small items, but included a few larger caskets like the Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States. Originally they were very often painted in bright colours. Reliefs can be impressed by stamps onto clay, or the clay pressed into a mould bearing the design, as was usual with the mass-produced of Ancient Roman pottery. Decorative reliefs in plaster or stucco may be much larger; this form of architectural decoration is found in many styles of interiors in the post-Renaissance West, and in Islamic architecture.

== Reliefs by modern artists ==

Many modern and contemporary artists such as Paul Gauguin, Ernst Barlach, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Pablo Picasso, Eric Gill, Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Claudia Cobizev, up to Ewald Matare have created reliefs.

In particular low reliefs were often used in the 20th century on the outsides of buildings, where they are relatively easy to incorporate into the architecture as decorative highlights.

<text>A longboard is a type of skateboard typified by longer decks and wheelbases, larger-diameter and softer (lower-durometer) wheels, and often lower riding height compared to street skateboards, though there is wide variation in the geometry and construction of longboards. Among the earliest types of skateboards, longboards were inspired by surfing, with early longboards drawing from the design of surfboards, resembling and mimicking the motion of riding a surfboard, but adapted to riding on streets in a practice known as &quot;sidewalk surfing&quot;.

Available in a wide variety of shapes, longboards are typically designed and optimized for &quot;cruising&quot; (covering distances at moderate speeds), commuting (as a practical means of personal transport), and &quot;downhill (racing)&quot;. The act of riding on a longboard in general is known as longboarding, which can also include more specialized forms such as longboard &quot;dancing&quot;, which involves stepping up and down a board and other movements and motions performed on the board while riding, and &quot;freestyle&quot;, which can encompass trick skating and executing tricks often associated with street skateboards.

== History ==
The first longboards were made by Preston Nichols in the 1940s and 1950s as an alternative to surfing when the waves were too dull. Early skaters built dangerous, improvised boards out of planks of wood and roller skates. Manufactured longboards first became commercially available in 1959 when Makaha, Jack&#x27;s, and Hobie became the first professional longboard distributors. These early longboards were still relatively crude, as they still featured metal wheels, but later had clay wheels due to improved safety factors. Longboarding became a popular activity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its popularity had largely died by 1965. Longboarding made a comeback in 1972 when Frank Nasworthy and the Cadillac Wheel Company introduced the urethane longboard wheel. Urethane wheels allowed skaters to reach very high downhill speeds which were not possible before. The introduction of reverse kingpins (RKP) also improved stability for riders. The exact inventor of reverse kingpins is unknown, however both Randal and Variflex had reverse kingpin trucks advertised and featured in Skateboarder magazine in 1979.
The reverse kingpin truck improved stability and suppleness which helped downhill longboarding grow into a legitimate sport, with the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) as its governing body. The 90&#x27;s also saw the introduction of the cutout deck, which has sections cut out around the wheels to prevent the wheels from touching the board during hard turns. Longboard technology has evolved rapidly to accommodate unique modern skating disciplines including downhill, slalom, freeriding, dancing, and freestyle. Modern longboard decks can be made from a variety of materials including fiberglass composites, aluminum, and carbon fiber. Precision trucks, which are machined with cutting edge CNC technology instead of die casting with molds, offer more strength and maneuverability than cast trucks and have achieved popularity among professional skaters.

==Dimensions==

Most boards measure in length while widths vary from . There are several longboard shapes, such as pintails, swallowtails, flat-nose riders, drop-through decks, drop decks and boards with the same shape as a conventional skateboard. Pintails permit looser trucks and larger wheels which are better suited for carving or a &quot;smooth&quot; feel, whereas drop decks and drop throughs allow the rider to be closer to the ground, hence a lower center of gravity which increases stability and allows these boards to support more high speed downhill riding disciplines. Mid-length boards, are the most versatile. Their greater weight and bulk makes them less suitable for many skateboarding tricks, but contributes to a fluid motion by providing more momentum. The longboard&#x27;s design allows for big turns or quick short carves similar to the motions of surfers or snowboarders. Longboards have 3 axes: the tail axis (running from tail to tail), the central axis (running straight down through the center of the board), and the short axis (running from the width of the board and perpendicular to the tail axis).

==Equipment and protection==

The ‘helmet culture’ is more prevalent in longboarding than in conventional skateboarding. Most riders wear protective equipment in all disciplines, and nearly all professionals wear a helmet and gloves. Longboard protective equipment is similar to standard skateboard equipment, with the exception of slide gloves. Most longboarders wear slide gloves and helmets, as these are considered the bare minimum for protection. Additional protection includes leathers, wrist guards, knee pads, elbow pads and sometimes spine protectors and padded shorts. Many professional longboarding teams and riders are required to wear and advocate all aspects of protection. In the sliding and downhill disciplines, riders wear &quot;slide gloves&quot; which are specialized gloves made out of strong materials such as leather and synthetic fabrics, and have large discs called &quot;pucks&quot; attached to the palms. These are attached to protect the hands as the rider uses them to pivot during slides along the ground. The pucks are usually made of synthetic polymers: delrin, UHMW, or corian.

==Components==
Longboards are very similar to conventional skateboards in terms of parts and general construction. Aside from the harder wheels of those made for sliding, they generally have larger dimensions, their trucks have tailored designs and proportions and their wheels are usually larger and softer. As a result, riding the specialized longboard feels quite different from the conventional skateboard.

===Decks===
Longboard decks are typically made from plywood: anywhere from two to eleven layers, each of usually in thickness, composed of birch, bamboo, maple, koa, or oak wood. Longboards are commercially available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Each variety has certain advantages and disadvantages, which come into play depending on the technique or personal preferences of the rider.

Decks intended for riding downhill are typically stiff and have a wheelbase of around 30&quot;-28&quot;. Designers and manufacturers aim to make these boards as stiff and light as possible. The primary three designs of downhill boards are &quot;drop decks&quot;, &quot;top mounts&quot; and &quot;drop throughs&quot;. Each design has its own advantages.

The &quot;drop deck&quot; has a lowered foot platform that sits below the height of the trucks, as a result, there is a lower center of gravity which adds to stability but gives less traction and maneuverability. Wooden drop decks are concave and have foot pockets by the drops. However, some carbon fiber boards feature concavity by the drops instead of foot pockets giving more leverage while turning.

The &quot;drop through&quot; design has cutouts that allow the base-plate of the truck to protrude through the board, thus lowering the deck and providing more stability. In addition to this, drop through decks decrease grip, as the deck is closer to the axle and moment arm of the wheel. There is also less leverage on the truck, which makes turning negligibly more difficult.

&quot;Top mount&quot; boards are the simplest design of the three. There are no dramatic bends aside from the foot concave. The board sits on top of the trucks as it would in a street skateboard. Advantages to this design include increased grip and ease of turning; disadvantages include a high center of gravity, which could contribute to a lack of stability.

There are many variations of the aforementioned designs, including a &quot;double-drop&quot; board, which incorporates both a drop through and drop down pattern. These are preferable for &quot;freeride&quot; as they are extremely low to the ground, which allows for ease of sliding. Footspace is important because there must be enough room on the board for the rider to form an aerodynamic &quot;tuck&quot;. Downhill boards are made as stiff as possible to minimize the amount of energy stored in the deck in order to mitigate wobbling of the board at high speed (known as &quot;speed wobbles&quot;).

Some boards are designed to be flexible. Flexible boards are usually intended for lower speed riding because when going faster, a flexible board can have torsional flex which is one cause of speed wobbles. Fiberglass is used in many new flexible boards as it is light like carbon fiber but more pliable.

Longboard decks can be shaped in such a way that they bow up or down along the length of the board. They can also have a downward bend along the width of the board. Concave boards, which bend upward on the sides, give the rider more friction for their toe and heel, thus giving them more control. A camber board is a gradual upward arch along the length of the board. This sets the center of the board above the truck mounts. This is often used on flexible boards to prevent the board from sagging when it is being ridden. A &quot;rocker&quot; shape is the opposite of camber, which sets the center of the board below the truck mounts when it is being ridden. This lets the rider more easily perform tricks like sliding by locking their feet into the board.

Decks recently have been made using materials other than wood. The types and quality of woods have increased over time and now many other &quot;superior&quot; materials have come into use. Aluminum, carbon fiber and fiberglass are just some of the new materials. Carbon fiber and fiberglass are used to strengthen or completely replace wood in decks because of their better strength to weight ratios. Some boards are pure carbon fiber with a foam core, these can weigh much less than boards of equal size. Aluminum decks are CNC cut out of sheets of aluminum and incredible shapes can be made. Bamboo is another popular material for constructing longboards because of its flexible and responsive properties.

====Fishtail====
The fishtail or pintail&#x27;s shape is used to prevent the wheel from coming in contact with the board (called &quot;wheelbite&quot;) while still providing ample footspace. Fishtails are most commonly used with top mounted trucks. They are also good cruising boards.
====Drop-Through====
Drop-Through boards, not to be confused with a double drop deck, have a cutout in the deck, allowing the baseplates of the trucks to be mounted through the deck. The lowered platform allows for a lower center of gravity, more control while sliding, and greater stability at high speeds.

====Hybrid====
These kind of longboards include wheel cutouts which provide room for the wheels to turn at sharper angles while avoiding wheelbite. Hybrids also tend to be shorter than other longboards, which promotes maneuverability.
====Cruiser====
A most common deck shape, these have a somewhat similar shape to normal skateboards, in that they have a &quot;kick-tail&quot; on the back. The main difference is it has trucks that are higher than standard skateboard trucks. Also, the wheels may be larger and are much softer than standard skateboard wheels. The bushings are much more flexible, giving the rider the ability to turn (carve) and maneuver more efficiently. These boards are more likely to cause &quot;wheel-bite&quot;.
===Trucks===
Trucks are the metal turning mechanism that attach the longboard wheels to the deck. They come in a wide range of styles, with wider trucks meaning a wider turning circle. They use the motion of the rider&#x27;s feet and body to turn the board by pivoting a joint in the middle of the truck. There are generally two types of trucks used on longboards: reverse kingpin trucks and conventional skateboard trucks (vertical kingpin). Conventional skateboard trucks have the kingpin on the inner side (towards the center of the board) of the axle, whereas reverse kingpin trucks have the kingpin on the outer side (towards the nose and tail) of the axle.

Popular conventional skateboard trucks include Independent and Tracker. Popular reverse kingpin trucks include Randal and Paris. Reverse kingpin trucks were created with longboarding in mind. While they are usually considered to have more grip and stability (two important things in the downhill discipline), conventional trucks have a very different feel that is often preferred by many longboarders.

The angle of the baseplate can also greatly influence the turning and stability of a truck. As a general rule, as the degree gets smaller, the truck will be more stable, but turn less (its turn essentially becomes more vertically oriented rather than horizontally oriented). For example, trucks with 44 degree baseplates will generally be more stable (turn less) than trucks with 50 degree baseplates.

===Bushings===
Bushings are perhaps the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a polyurethane material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing&#x27;s characteristics. While it depends on the size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.
Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.

===Riser pads===
Riser pads increase the distance between the wheels on a longboard and the deck in order to prevent wheel bite (when the deck scrapes the wheels, causing the wheels to stop turning). They also reduce the strain on the deck from the trucks being directly in contact with it and the vibration caused through riding. Riser pads are normally made of plastic. Shock pads, which are more rubbery than riser pads, serve the same function only with more emphasis on reducing strain and less on increasing the distance between the wheels and deck. Riser pads also come angled which can make the board turn more or less. Angled risers are usually used in long distance pumping to help aid the rider in propelling the board without pushing.

===Bearings===
Longboard bearings are all about reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt. Bearings connect the wheel to turn smoothly. Bearings can be made of many materials, including steel (which is most prevalent), titanium, or ceramics. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the ABEC scale. The ratings run from 1–9, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings&#x27; resistance and durability. Optionally, longboarders add bearing spacers between the bearings in the wheels. This allows for the axle nut to be tightened all the way down eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.

=== Grip tape ===
Grip tape is a gritty material on the top of the board that provides traction so that shoes stay on the board. The tape comes in rolls that have a strong adhesive on the bottom. They are applied to the top of the board and then cut to fit the shape. Black sheet is the most common, however they can come in many colors or even can come in the form of a clear spray on adhesive. Most black grip tape is made of silicon carbide which provides excellent grip and stays sharp for a long time. However, some black tape and most colored tape is made from aluminum oxide which is a cheaper material and will lose a lot of grip over time. The tape gets dirty after a lot of use, which is more apparent on the clear and lighter colors. It will lose a lot of the grip after using it for a while, but it is easily replaced by heating the board to loosen the adhesive on the bottom and using a razor blade to separate it from the board.

===Wheels===
Almost all longboard wheels are made from urethane. The performance of longboard wheels is determined by five characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, durometer, and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range from in diameter. A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster rolling speed. Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets rougher a softer wheel provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a. Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is the width of the section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from in width, but most commonly between . The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction. Rounded lips are made to break loose into a slide and square lips are made to grip. Square lipped wheels do break loose but the slide is not as smooth as that of a round lipped wheel. A wheel hub (or core) is the plastic (or sometimes aluminum) center of a wheel that holds the bearings. The position of the hub affects the properties of the wheel.

====Centerset wheels====
The hubs in centerset wheels are set equidistant from each lip of the wheel. Centerset wheels tend to have the most grip, because they have large inner lips, and it is the inner lip of a longboard wheel that grips the most. Some longboarders prefer centerset wheels for sliding because they wear more evenly and when they become coned they can be flipped and still have the same feel. Centerset wheels are more difficult to break loose than other wheels, and more speed is lost during the slide, but the slide is more controlled because of the grip the wheel has.

====Side-set wheels====
Side-set have wheel hubs set flush with the inside edge of the wheel. Side-set wheels offer a smooth transition from grip to slide, the slide typically being longer than that of any other wheel. This type of wheel has by far the fastest and most uneven wear because the rider&#x27;s weight is on the very inside of the wheel. Freeriding is typically the discipline that this particular kind of wheel is used for.

====Offset wheels====
The hub of an offset wheel is between the center and the inside edge of the wheel. Offset wheels provide less grip than a centerset wheel, but more than a side-set wheel. Similarly, they break loose more easily than a centerset wheel, but less easily than a side-set wheel. These wheels usually feature square edges for more traction around corners or in carves. Off-set wheels are the most common wheel, typically used and designed for Downhill but they are used for all the other disciplines as well.

==Additional equipment==
===Slide gloves===

A pair of slide gloves is an important piece of equipment for longboarding. Slide gloves are for control as much as for safety. They allow the rider to touch the road and lean on his or her hand(s) to slide to a stop, to pre-drift into a corner, to touch the road to regain balance if balance is lost, and to protect the hands and support the rider&#x27;s body during a fall.
There are many style moves that also can slow the rider down that can be used called slides. There are various slides such as the K9, pendulum, coleman, and 1 footed stalefish. These type of gloves could be home made with just a thick plastic layer, and a glove.
===Land paddle===
A land paddle is a large pole or stick, usually with rubber or a similar material on the end, which can be used as a form of locomotion derived by the rider&#x27;s arms to propel the rider further without the use of the rider&#x27;s legs, to maintain balance while riding, and as a brake. The material at the end of the stick may appear circular but does not turn while attached. The shape allows riders to manually remove, turn and replace the attachment to promote even wear and extend its useful life.
==Longboard disciplines==
===Cruising===

The &quot;classic&quot; purpose of longboards is for riding at a casual pace as a means of transportation. The focus is on foot pushing and relaxed riding at low speed along roads, paths, and city streets. Any longboard or skateboard can be used for cruising, though some are easier to push, brake, or ride at high speeds than others.

Long Distance Push – &quot;LDP&quot; is considered a subset of general cruising, but with the goal of riding long distances, often as a means of exercise. This style of riding requires greater expertise in riding switch (pushes with the weaker foot), foot-breaking, and pushing for power and speed. Dropped and double dropped decks are typically used here, making pushing easier than on a dropthrough or topmount board.
===Carving===

Carving, in and of itself, is not necessarily a discipline of longboarding. However, there are numerous subsets of carving that make its designation as a discipline more appropriate. Carving is a surf-like riding style that involves chaining quick successive turns back and forth in an S-like shape trajectory, in order to build and maintain momentum and speed. A longboard of any length or mounting style can be used to carve.

Pumping – Involves swaying your body back and forth and shifting your weight in a way that makes your longboard perform quick small turns, gaining momentum by leveraging centripetal forces, without your feet ever touching the ground. Carving is to reduce speed while pumping is meant to gain or maintain it. As a rule of thumb, a smaller deck will allow you to start pumping at a lower speed, while a larger deck will let you pump faster once at higher speeds.

Long Distance Pumping – Pumping for long distances, often combined with pushing. Commonly referred-to as &quot;LDP&quot; ,this is a minor subset of longboarding that has an avid, global group of riders.

Surfskating – A mix of carving and pumping, designed to simulate surfing. Typical short and wide with small wheels.

Slalom – Fast pumping over short distances, swerving around cones. Typically done as part of a racing competition on a shorter, highly maneuverable board.
===Downhill===

Downhill – Also referred to as Speedboarding. Drop-through, drop-platform, and top-mount longboards are all used in downhill skateboarding. Downhill decks are very stiff and usually have a small to medium wheelbase around 20–25”.

Freeride – A subdiscipline of downhill. Freeriding involves downhill riding at low to moderate speed, with a focus on performing stylish power slides and drifts to control descent. Lighter freeriding is often done on drop-through or dropped decks and typically done at lower speeds.

Tech Sliding – Tech sliding, or technical sliding, is a discipline of downhill skateboarding where riders typically use hard wheels to bust out multiple fast-paced and creative slides. This discipline is only limited by the rider’s creativity. Decks are symmetrical and very hard wheels (95a-101a) are often used.
===Freestyle===

Freestyle longboarding is a varied, diverse discipline that has roots in classic skateboarding while evolving beyond to be more suitable to the larger deck sizes used in longboarding. Freestyle is seen as an art, where riders use creative tricks and technical moves. For a classic and more flowly/slidy type of freestyle, a mid to full-sized double kick longboard, usually ranging from 42” – 47” is often used.

Street/Ramp – Similar to street skating with its technical stunts, but with cruisers that are larger than classic skateboards. For street maneuvers like ollies and skate park riding, the best freestyle longboard typically looks like an oversized street skateboard, with bigger wheels for smoother rides.

Dance – A relatively new, artsy subdiscipline of freestyle longboarding. Dancing involves walking and cross-stepping on a moving longboard, performing elegant and stylish body spinning movements and even actual dancing, all while keeping the board rolling and carving on flat surfaces. Dancing longboards are in a category of their own, typically 40+ inches long.

<text>Broken Obelisk is a sculpture designed by Barnett Newman between 1963 and 1967. Fabricated from three tons of Cor-Ten steel, which acquires a rust-colored patina, it is the largest and best known of his six sculptures.

The first two multiples of the sculpture were fabricated by Lippincott, Inc. in North Haven, Connecticut in 1966–67. The sculpture first appeared on display in front of the Seagram Building in New York City and outside the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC where it was part of an exhibit titled &quot;Scale and Content&quot; (1967), which also consisted of Tony Smith&#x27;s &quot;Smoke&quot; and Ronald Bladen&#x27;s &quot;The X&quot;. &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot; generated some controversy in Washington, as it appeared to be a reference to a broken upside-down Washington Monument at a time of civil unrest. When Corcoran director James Harithas resigned in 1969, Barnett Newman had the sculpture removed.

A third multiple, which included some internal, structural improvements, was completed in 1969 by Lippincott, Inc., which became part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. For a short period of time in 1969–70, the first three multiples of this sculpture sat side by side at the Lippincott, Inc. foundry in North Haven. One was secured by John de Menil with a matching grant from the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities and was installed on the grounds of the Rothko Chapel in Houston in 1970, surrounded by a reflecting pool. As a condition set by de Menil, the sculpture in Houston is dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr. Virginia Wright secured another multiple, which was installed in Red Square on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle in 1971.

With the permission of the Barnett Newman Foundation, a fourth multiple was commissioned in 2003 and completed in 2005–06 by Lippincott, Merrifield, and Roberts. This last of the four multiples was installed in front of the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin in 2007–08 and later acquired by Storm King Art Center. In the summer of 2014, all four multiples were on display in the United States at the following locations: Rothko Chapel, Houston; Red Square, University of Washington, Seattle; Museum of Modern Art, New York City; and Storm King Art Center, New Windsor, New York.

Art critic Robert Hughes, writing on &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot; in 1971, said:

== Locations ==

Four versions of the sculpture exist. Three originals were fabricated in the 1960s during the artist&#x27;s life; two in 1967, and a third for MoMA in 1969. A fourth &quot;Exhibition Copy&quot; was completed in 2005.

<text>Guru Har Krishan (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ ਹਰਿ ਕ੍ਰਿਸ਼ਨ, pronunciation: ; 7 July 1656 – 30 March 1664) also known as Bal Guru (Child Guru), or Hari Krishan Sahib, was the eighth of the ten Sikh Gurus. At the age of five, he succeeded his father, Guru Har Rai, and became the youngest Guru in Sikhism. He contracted smallpox in 1664 and died before reaching his eighth birthday. It is said that he died because he contracted smallpox while successfully curing his followers.

He is remembered in the Sikh tradition for saying &quot;Baba Bakale&quot; before he died, which Sikhs interpreted to identify his granduncle Guru Tegh Bahadur as the next successor. Guru Har Krishan had the shortest reign as Guru, lasting only two years, five months and 24 days.

==Biography==

Har Krishan was born in Kiratpur Sahib (Shivalik Hills) in northwest Indian subcontinent to Krishen Devi (Mata Sulakhni) and Guru Har Rai on 20 July 1652. His family belonged to the Sodhi clan of Khatris. His father supported the moderate Sufi influenced Dara Shikoh instead of conservative Sunni influenced Aurangzeb as the two brothers entered into a war of succession to the Mughal Empire throne. After Aurangzeb won the succession war in 1658, he summoned Guru Har Rai in 1660 to explain his support for the executed Dara Shikoh. Guru Har Rai sent his elder son Ram Rai to represent him. Aurangzeb kept the 13 year old Ram Rai as hostage, questioned Ram Rai about a verse in the Adi Granth – the holy text of Sikhs. Aurangzeb claimed that it disparaged the Muslims. Ram Rai changed the verse to appease Aurangzeb instead of standing by the Sikh scripture, an act for which Guru Har Rai excommunicated his elder son, and nominated the younger Har Krishan to succeed as the next Guru of Sikhism. He became 7 October 1661,

=== Requested meeting with Aurangzeb ===
Aurangzeb meanwhile rewarded Ram Rai, patronizing him with land grants in Dehra Dun region of the Himalayas. A few years after Guru Har Krishan assumed the role of Sikh leader, Aurangzeb summoned the young Guru to his court through Raja Jai Singh, with an apparent plan to replace him with his elder brother Ram Rai as the Sikh Guru. However, Har Krishan contracted smallpox when he arrived in Delhi and his meeting with Aurangzeb was cancelled. Some sources state that he outright refused to meet with the Mughal emperor as he had foretold that Aurangzeb would demand he perform miracles, which are forbidden to be displayed in Sikhism. On his deathbed, Har Krishan said, &quot;Baba Bakale&quot;, and died in 1664. The Sikh religious organization interpreted those words to mean that the next Guru is to be found in Bakale village, which they identified as Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru of Sikhism. This proclamation frustrated Aurangzeb, who was eager to have Ram Rai installed as the next Sikh Guru so that he could control the community.

=== Visiting Raja Jai Singh and death ===

One of the most famous Gurdwara of Sikhs in North India, Gurdwara Bangla Sahib was at that time the residence (&quot;bangla&quot; is an Indic term for bungalow) of Raja Jai Singh of Delhi.

=== Final moments ===
Kavi Santokh Singh writes about the Guru&#x27;s last moments,

&quot;&#x27;Whilst addressing the congregation Sri Guru Harkrishan Ji say&#x27;s there are multiple reasons for me leaving this body however it will do no good to dwell on them&quot;
&quot;Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s gaddi (throne) is continuous, It’s magnificence will continue to grow and never shrink. Requests will be fulfilled by whoever sits on this throne, seek the discourse of the Guru and practice it.&quot;
&quot;The Granth will be your Guru. Those who wish to see me can do so by doing darshan (sight) of the Granth Sahib. Whoever views the Guru Granth Sahib with devotion their sins will be removed instantly.&#x27;Those who wish to speak to me, can do so by reading and listening to the Guru Granth Sahib. Those who practice what has been written in the Granth Sahib will obtain the 4 treasures of this world.&#x27;Anyone who comes with an intention or worry, seek the sanctuary of the Guru Granth Sahib and their issues will be resolved instantly.29. Everything belongs to those who are truly devoted, there is nothing for fakes. This body is temporary which is why the Granth should be Guru.30. Do darshan (see) of it with your eyes, bow to it and obtain its knowledge to enlighten yourself. Hearing this from Guru Ji everyone had tears in their eyes.31.&#x27;The Sangat feeling hopelessness and despair. This darshan (vision) of Sat Guru Ji will be the last and now has become even more precious.&#x27;96 minutes have passed and the sun has set, Gurbaksh and other presented their innermost desire to Guru Harkrishan Ji.9. Reciting the names of all the previous Guru’s they asked the benevolent Guru to hear their request.10. Sri Guru Har Rai Ji did not see their elder son fit to be a Guru and then excommunicated him from the community.11.(p.373)&#x27;Bless the sangat with someone like you, so that Sikhi may continue to flourish. If you do not continue this lineage then it will go against what Guru Nanak Dev had established15. The Sangat will be confused as to who to follow, some will follow Dhirmal, some will follow Ram Rai.16.Others will follow people in the Sodhi lineage. The sangat will fracture without a Guru like You, like an army without a commander.17.&#x27;Guru Harkrishan Ji listened thought to themselves that a Guru cannot leave the earth like this. A Guru is like the Sun which sets at night but raising the next day.24. They called for a coconut and 5 paisay (money) to be bought to them and asked the sangat to sit down. “The next Guru will be powerful and magnificent, in front of who fake Guru’s will not exist”.25. “Millions will become His devotees, those who seek His sanctuary will be liberated. He will steadfast like the earth and benevolent like the sun.26. He will establish Sikhi and those who have lost their way will seek His sanctuary. His magnificence will radiate throughout the world. He will evolve sikhi into something new and better”.27.&#x27;With folded hands and closed eyes Guru Harkrishan said &quot;Baba basay je gram bikale&quot;. The entire congregation who was present heard this.36.&quot;

== Historiography ==

Authentic literature with more details about Guru Har Krishan&#x27;s life and times are scarce and not well recorded. Some of biographies about Guru Har Krishan, particularly about who his mother was, were written in the 18th century such as by Kesar Singh Chhibber, as well as in the 19th century, and these are highly inconsistent.

<text>Oliver&#x27;s Twist is a 2002 television series featuring chef Jamie Oliver. The name of the program is a play on the title of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Following the popularity of his first TV series, &quot;The Naked Chef&quot;, Oliver began producing &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Twist&quot; to be aired outside the UK. The show became a success — being aired in over 70 countries — and helped establish Oliver&#x27;s global popularity.

== Production ==
The show was produced by Oliver&#x27;s own production company, Fresh One Productions, and 52 episodes were aired in total. All music for the show was composed by Leigh Haggerwood. &quot;Just the Start&quot;, the theme song, was performed by Scarlet Division, the band for which Oliver has been a drummer for since 1989.

<doc id="545824" wikidata="Q861011" url="?curid=545824" title="Goosefish">
<text>Goosefishes, sometimes called anglers or monkfishes, are a family, the Lophiidae, of marine ray-finned fishes belonging to the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes. The family includes 30 recognized species. These fishes are found in all the world&#x27;s oceans except for the Antarctic Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
The goosefish family, Lophiidae, was first proposed as a genus in 1810 by the French polymath and naturalist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. The Lophiidae is the only family in the monotypic suborder Lophioidei, this is one of 5 suborders of the Lophiiformes. The Lophioidei is considered to be the most basal of the suborders in the order.

==Etymology==
The goosefish family, Lophiidae, takes its name from its type genus, &quot;Lophius&quot;. &quot;Lophius&quot; means &quot;mane&quot; and is presumably a reference to the first 3 spines of the first dorsal fin which are tentacle like, with 3 smaller spines behind them.

==Genera==
The goosefish family, Lophiidae, contains the following extant genera:
===Fossil taxa===
The following extinct taxa are also among those included in the family Lophiidae:
* Genus &quot;Caruso&quot; 
** &quot;Caruso brachysomus&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Emmachaere&quot; 
** &quot;Emmachaere rhomalea&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Eosladenia&quot; 
** &quot;Eosladenia caucasica&quot; 
* Genus &quot;Sharfia&quot; 
** &quot;Sharfia mirabilis&quot; 

==Characteristics==
Goosefishes in the family Lophiidae have flattened heads and bodies covered in thin skin and are further characterised by the possession of pelvic fins with the first, spiny dorsal fin having its origin close to the rear of the head and this fin is supported by between one and three spines. The frontmost spine, the illicium, has a flap of flesh, the esca, at its tip and is used as a lure to attract prey to within reach of the cavernous mouth. There are 4 pharyngobranchials, the 4th being toothed, and they have a large pseudobranch. The body has no scales and the frontal bones of the skull are fused. They have a very wide, flattened head, although &quot;Sladenia&quot; has a more rounded head, with well developed teeth. The lower jaw has a fringe of small flaps along its edge and these extend along the head onto the flanks. The second dorsal fin is supported by between 8 and 12 soft rays while the anal fin contains between 6 and 10 soft rays. Most taxa have 18 or 19 vertebrae but in &quot;Lophius&quot; this count is between 26 and 31. The opening to the gills os located to the rear of the pectoral fin base. The largest species in the family is the angler (&quot;Lophius piscatorius&quot;) which has a maximum published standard length of while the smallest is &quot;Lophiodes fimbriatus&quot; with a maximum published standard length of .

==Distribution==
The goosefishes, family Lophiidae are found in the temperate, tropical, and subtropical Atlantic Indian and Pacific Oceans.

==Habitat and biology==
The goosefishes are typically found on soft substrates on the continental margin, most frequently at depths greater than , and there are species whichhave been found at depths greater than . A few species, such as the American angler (&quot;Lophius americanus&quot;) are found in shallower waters, sometimes moving into bays and estuaries with high-salinity water in the winter. At least in the genus &quot;Lophius&quot; the females release their spawn enclosed within a gelatinous mass, which has been compared to the spawn of toads in appearance, which floats. They have pelagic eggs and larvae with demersal juveniles and benthic adults.

==Utilisation==
Goosefishes, particularly several of the large species in the genus &quot;Lophius&quot;, commonly known as monkfishes in northern Europe, are important commercially fished species. The liver of monkfish, known as &quot;ankimo&quot;, is considered a delicacy in Japan.

<doc id="545825" wikidata="Q1139726" url="?curid=545825" title="Impulse response">
<text>In signal processing and control theory, the impulse response, or impulse response function (IRF), of a dynamic system is its output when presented with a brief input signal, called an impulse (). More generally, an impulse response is the reaction of any dynamic system in response to some external change. In both cases, the impulse response describes the reaction of the system as a function of time (or possibly as a function of some other independent variable that parameterizes the dynamic behavior of the system).

In all these cases, the dynamic system and its impulse response may be actual physical objects, or may be mathematical systems of equations describing such objects.

Since the impulse function contains all frequencies (see the Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function, showing infinite frequency bandwidth that the Dirac delta function has), the impulse response defines the response of a linear time-invariant system for all frequencies.

==Mathematical considerations==

Mathematically, how the impulse is described depends on whether the system is modeled in discrete or continuous time. The impulse can be modeled as a Dirac delta function for continuous-time systems, or as the discrete unit sample function for discrete-time systems. The Dirac delta represents the limiting case of a pulse made very short in time while maintaining its area or integral (thus giving an infinitely high peak). While this is impossible in any real system, it is a useful idealization. In Fourier analysis theory, such an impulse comprises equal portions of all possible excitation frequencies, which makes it a convenient test probe.

Any system in a large class known as &quot;linear, time-invariant&quot; (LTI) is completely characterized by its impulse response. That is, for any input, the output can be calculated in terms of the input and the impulse response. (See LTI system theory.) The impulse response of a linear transformation is the image of Dirac&#x27;s delta function under the transformation, analogous to the fundamental solution of a partial differential operator.

It is usually easier to analyze systems using transfer functions as opposed to impulse responses. The transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse response. The Laplace transform of a system&#x27;s output may be determined by the multiplication of the transfer function with the input&#x27;s Laplace transform in the complex plane, also known as the frequency domain. An inverse Laplace transform of this result will yield the output in the time domain.

To determine an output directly in the time domain requires the convolution of the input with the impulse response. When the transfer function and the Laplace transform of the input are known, this convolution may be more complicated than the alternative of multiplying two functions in the frequency domain.

The impulse response, considered as a Green&#x27;s function, can be thought of as an &quot;influence function&quot;: how a point of input influences output.

==Practical applications==
In practical systems, it is not possible to produce a perfect impulse to serve as input for testing; therefore, a brief pulse is sometimes used as an approximation of an impulse. Provided that the pulse is short enough compared to the impulse response, the result will be close to the true, theoretical, impulse response. In many systems, however, driving with a very short strong pulse may drive the system into a nonlinear regime, so instead the system is driven with a pseudo-random sequence, and the impulse response is computed from the input and output signals.

===Loudspeakers===
An application that demonstrates this idea was the development of impulse response loudspeaker testing in the 1970s. Loudspeakers suffer from phase inaccuracy, a defect unlike other measured properties such as frequency response. Phase inaccuracy is caused by (slightly) delayed frequencies/octaves that are mainly the result of passive cross overs (especially higher order filters) but are also caused by resonance, energy storage in the cone, the internal volume, or the enclosure panels vibrating. Measuring the impulse response, which is a direct plot of this &quot;time-smearing,&quot; provided a tool for use in reducing resonances by the use of improved materials for cones and enclosures, as well as changes to the speaker crossover. The need to limit input amplitude to maintain the linearity of the system led to the use of inputs such as pseudo-random maximum length sequences, and to the use of computer processing to derive the impulse response.

===Electronic processing===
Impulse response analysis is a major facet of radar, ultrasound imaging, and many areas of digital signal processing. An interesting example would be broadband internet connections. DSL/Broadband services use adaptive equalisation techniques to help compensate for signal distortion and interference introduced by the copper phone lines used to deliver the service.

===Control systems===
In control theory the impulse response is the response of a system to a Dirac delta input. This proves useful in the analysis of dynamic systems; the Laplace transform of the delta function is 1, so the impulse response is equivalent to the inverse Laplace transform of the system&#x27;s transfer function.

===Acoustic and audio applications===
In acoustic and audio applications, impulse responses enable the acoustic characteristics of a location, such as a concert hall, to be captured. Various packages are available containing impulse responses from specific locations, ranging from small rooms to large concert halls. These impulse responses can then be utilized in convolution reverb applications to enable the acoustic characteristics of a particular location to be applied to target audio.

In electric guitar signal processing and amplifier modeling, impulse response recordings are often used by modeling software to recreate the recorded tone of guitar speakers.

===Economics===
In economics, and especially in contemporary macroeconomic modeling, impulse response functions are used to describe how the economy reacts over time to exogenous impulses, which economists usually call shocks, and are often modeled in the context of a vector autoregression. Impulses that are often treated as exogenous from a macroeconomic point of view include changes in government spending, tax rates, and other fiscal policy parameters; changes in the monetary base or other monetary policy parameters; changes in productivity or other technological parameters; and changes in preferences, such as the degree of impatience. Impulse response functions describe the reaction of endogenous macroeconomic variables such as output, consumption, investment, and employment at the time of the shock and over subsequent points in time. Recently, asymmetric impulse response functions have been suggested in the literature that separate the impact of a positive shock from a negative one.

<text>Guru Tegh Bahadur (Punjabi: ਗੁਰੂ ਤੇਗ਼ ਬਹਾਦਰ ; ; 1 April 1621 – 11 November 1675) was the ninth of ten gurus who founded the Sikh religion and was the leader of Sikhs from 1665 until his beheading in 1675. He was born in Amritsar, Punjab, India in 1621 and was the youngest son of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh guru. Considered a principled and fearless warrior, he was a learned spiritual scholar and a poet whose 115 hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the main text of Sikhism.

Guru Tegh Bahadur was executed on the orders of Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor, in Delhi, India. Sikh holy premises Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib and Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib in Delhi mark the places of execution and cremation of Guru Tegh Bahadur. His day of martyrdom (&quot;Shaheedi Divas&quot;) is commemorated in India every year on 24 November.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Guru Tegh Bahadur was born &quot;Tyag Mal&quot; (Tīāg Mal) () in Amritsar on 1 April 1621. He was the youngest son of Guru Hargobind, the sixth guru. His family belonged to the Sodhi clan of Khatris. Hargobind had one daughter, Bibi Viro, and five sons: Baba Gurditta, Suraj Mal, Ani Rai, Atal Rai, and Tyag Mal. He gave Tyag Mal the name &quot;Tegh Bahadur&quot; (Brave Sword) after Tyag Mal showed valor in the Battle of Kartarpur against the Mughals.

Tegh Bahadur was brought up in the Sikh culture and trained in archery and horsemanship. He was also taught the old classics such as the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Puranas. He was married on 3 February 1632 to Gujri.

In the 1640s, nearing his death, Guru Hargobind and his wife Nanaki moved to his ancestral village of Bakala in Amritsar district, together with Tegh Bahadur and Gujri. After Hargobind&#x27;s death, Tegh Bahadur continued to live in Bakala with his wife and mother.

===Installation as Guru of Sikhs===
In March 1664, Guru Har Krishan contracted smallpox. When his followers asked who would lead them after him, he said, &quot;Baba Bakala&quot;, meaning his successor was to be found in Bakala. Taking advantage of the ambiguity in the words of the dying guru, many installed themselves in Bakala, claiming to be the new guru. Sikhs were puzzled to see so many claimants.

Sikh tradition has a legend about how Tegh Bahadur was selected as the ninth guru. A wealthy trader named Makhan Shah Labana had vowed to give 500 gold coins to the Sikh Guru upon escaping a shipwreck some time ago, and he came to Bakala in search of the ninth guru. He met each claimant he could find, making his obeisance and offering them two gold coins in the belief that the right guru would know of his silent promise to give them 500 coins. Every &quot;guru&quot; he met accepted the two gold coins and bid him farewell. Then he discovered that Tegh Bahadur also lived at Bakala. Makhan Shah gave Tegh Bahadur the usual offering of two gold coins. Tegh Bahadur blessed him and remarked that his offering was short of the promised five hundred. Makhan Shah made good the difference and ran upstairs. He began shouting from the rooftop, &quot;Guru ladho re, Guru ladho re&quot;, meaning &quot;I have found the Guru, I have found the Guru&quot;.

In August 1664, a Sikh congregation led by Diwan Dargha Mal, son of a well-known devotee of Har Krishan, arrived in Bakala and appointed Tegh Bahadur as the ninth guru of Sikhs.

As had been the custom among Sikhs after the execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, Guru Tegh Bahadur was surrounded by armed bodyguards, but he otherwise lived an austere life.

=== Journeys ===
Guru Tegh Bahadur traveled extensively in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, including Dhaka and Assam, to preach the teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru. The places he visited and stayed in became sites of Sikh temples. During his travels, he started a number of community water wells and &quot;langars&quot; (community kitchens for the poor).

Tegh Bahadur visited the towns of Mathura, Agra, Allahabad and Varanasi. His son, Guru Gobind Singh, who would be the tenth Sikh guru, was born in Patna in 1666 while he was away in Dhubri, Assam, where the Gurdwara Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib now stands. While in Assam, it is claimed by Sikh accounts that the guru brokered peace between Raja Ram Singh and the Ahom ruler Raja Chakradhwaj Singha (Supangmung).

After his visit to Assam, Bengal, and Bihar, Guru Tegh Bahadur visited Rani Champa of Bilaspur, who offered to give the Guru a piece of land in her state. The Guru bought the site for 500 rupees. There, he founded the city of Anandpur Sahib in the foothills of the Himalayas. In 1672, Tegh Bahadur traveled in and around the Malwa region to meet the masses as the persecution of non-Muslims reached new heights.

==Execution==

=== Narrative ===
Many scholars identify the traditional Sikh narrative as follows: A congregation of Hindu Pandits from Kashmir requested help against Aurangzeb&#x27;s persecutions and oppressive policies, and Guru Tegh Bahadur decided to protect their rights. According to Trilochan Singh in &quot;Guru Tegh Bahadur: Prophet and Martyr&quot;, the convoy of Kashmiri Pandits who tearfully pleaded with the Guru at Anandpur were 500 in number and were led by a certain Pandit Kirpa Ram, who recounted tales of religious oppression under the governorship of Iftikhar Khan. The Kashmiri Pandits decided to meet with the Guru after they first sought the assistance of Shiva at the Amarnath shrine, where one of them is said to have had a dream where Shiva instructed the Pandits to seek out the ninth Sikh guru for assistance in their plight and hence a group was formed for carrying out the task. Guru Tegh Bahadur left from his base at Makhowal to confront the persecution of Kashmiri Pandits by Mughal officials but was arrested at Ropar and put to jail in Sirhind. Four months later, in November 1675, he was transferred to Delhi and asked to perform a miracle to prove his nearness to God or convert to Islam. The Guru declined, and three of his colleagues, who had been arrested with him, were tortured to death in front of him: Bhai Mati Das was sawn in two, Bhai Dayal Das was thrown into a cauldron of boiling liquid, and Bhai Sati Das was cut into pieces. Thereafter on 11 November, Tegh Bahadur was publicly beheaded in Chandni Chowk, a market square close to the Red Fort.

=== Historiography ===
The primary nucleus of Sikh narratives remains the &quot;Bachittar Natak&quot;, a memoir of Guru Gobind Singh, Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s son, dated between late 1680s and late 1690s. 
Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s son and successor recalled the Guru&#x27;s execution:

More Sikh accounts of Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s execution, all claiming to be sourced from the &quot;testimony of trustworthy Sikhs&quot;, only started emerging in around the late eighteenth century, and are thus, often conflicting, according to historian Satish Chandra.

Persian and non Sikh sources maintain that the Guru was a bandit whose plunder and rapine of Punjab along with his rebellious activities precipitated his execution. According to Chandra, the earliest Persian source to chronicle his execution is &quot;Siyar-ul-Mutakhkherin&quot; by Ghulam Husain Khan c. 1782, where Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s (alleged) oppression of subjects is held to have incurred Aurangzeb&#x27;s wrath:

Chandra cautions against taking Ghulam Husain&#x27;s argument at face value, as Ghulam Husain was a relative of Alivardi Khan — one of the closest confidantes of Aurangzeb — and might have been providing an &quot;official justification&quot;. Also, the Guru&#x27;s alleged association with Hafiz Adam is anachronistic. Chandra further writes that Ghulam Husain&#x27;s account places Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s confinement and execution in Lahore, while Sikh tradition places it in Delhi, and Chandra finds no reason to reject said tradition. 

The Sikh &quot;sakhis&quot; (traditional accounts) written during the eighteenth century indirectly support the narrative in the Persian sources, saying that &quot;the Guru was in violent opposition to the Muslim rulers of the country&quot; in response to the dogmatic policies implemented by Aurangzeb. Both Persian and Sikh sources agree that Guru Tegh Bahadur militarily opposed the Mughal state and was therefore targeted for execution in accordance with Aurangzeb&#x27;s zeal for punishing enemies of the state.

Bhimsen, a contemporary chronicler of Guru Gobind Singh, wrote (c.1708) that the successors of Guru Nanak maintained extravagant lifestyles, and some of them, including Tegh Bahadur, rebelled against the state: Tegh Bahadur proclaimed himself Padshah and acquired a large following, as a result, Aurangzeb had him executed. Muhammad Qasim&#x27;s &quot;Ibratnama,&quot; written in 1723, claimed Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s religious inclinations along with his life of splendor and conferral of sovereignty by his followers had him condemned and executed.

Chronicler Sohan Lal Suri, the court historian of Ranjit Singh, in his magisterial &quot;Umdat ut Tawarikh&quot; (c. 1805) chose to reiterate Ghulam Husain Khan&#x27;s argument at large: he states that the Guru gained thousands of followers of soldiers and horsemen during his travels between 1672 and 1673 in southern Punjab, essentially having a nomadic army, and provided shelter to rebels who were resistant to Mughal representatives. Aurangzeb was warned about such activity as a cause of concern that could possibly lead to insurrection or rebellion and to eliminate the threat of the Guru at the earliest opportunity. 

Chandra writes that in contrast to this dominating theme in Sikh literature, some pre-modern Sikh accounts had laid the blame on an acrimonious succession dispute: Ram Rai, elder brother of Guru Har Krishan, was held to have instigated Aurangzeb against Tegh Bahadur by suggesting that he prove his spiritual greatness by performing miracles at the Court.
=== Scholarly analysis ===
Satish Chandra expresses doubt about the authenticity of these meta-narratives, centered on miracles — Aurangzeb was not a believer in them, according to Chandra. He further expresses doubt pertaining to the narrative of the persecution of Hindus in Kashmir within Sikh accounts, remarking that no contemporary sources mentioned the persecution of Hindus there. 

Louis E. Fenech refuses to pass any judgement, in light of the paucity of primary sources; however, he notes that these Sikh accounts had coded martyrdom into the events, with an aim to elicit pride rather than trauma in readers. He further argues that Tegh Bahadur sacrificed himself for the sake of his own faith, saying that the &quot;janju&quot; and &quot;tilak&quot; mentioned in a passage in the Bachittar Natak refer to Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s own sacred thread and frontal mark. 

Barbara Metcalf notes that Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s familial ties to Dara Shikoh (Aurangzeb summoned both Guru Har Rai and later Guru Har Krishan to his court to account for their rumored support to Shikoh), along with his proselytization and being a military organizer, invoked both political and Islamic justifications for the execution.

==Legacy and memorials==

Guru Tegh Bahadur composed 116 hymns in 15 &quot;ragas&quot; (musical measures), and these were included in the Guru Granth Sahib (pages 219–1427) by his son, Guru Gobind Singh. They cover a wide range of spiritual topics, including human attachments, the body, the mind, sorrow, dignity, service, death, and deliverance.

Guru Tegh Bahadur built the city of Anandpur Sahib and was responsible for saving a faction of Kashmiri Pandits, who were being persecuted by the Mughals.

After the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a number of Sikh gurudwaras were built in his and his associates&#x27; memory. The Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, was built over where he was beheaded. Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib, also in Delhi, is built where one of Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s disciples burned his house down to cremate the Guru&#x27;s body.

Gurdwara Sisganj Sahib in Punjab marks the site where, in November 1675, the head of the martyred Guru Tegh Bahadur was cremated after being brought there by Bhai Jaita (renamed Bhai Jiwan Singh according to Sikh rites) in defiance of the Mughal authority of Aurangzeb.

The execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur hardened the resolve of Sikhs against Muslim rule and persecution. Pashaura Singh states that &quot;if the martyrdom of Guru Arjan had helped bring the Sikh Panth together, Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s martyrdom helped to make the protection of human rights central to its Sikh identity&quot;. Wilfred Smith stated that &quot;the attempt to forcibly convert the ninth Guru to an externalized, impersonal Islam clearly made an indelible impression on the martyr&#x27;s nine-year-old son, Gobind, who reacted slowly but deliberately by eventually organizing the Sikh group into a distinct, formal, symbol-patterned community&quot;. It inaugurated the Khalsa identity.

In one of his poetic works, the classical Punjabi poet Bulleh Shah, referred to Guru Tegh Bahadur as &quot;Ghazi&quot;, an honorific title for a warrior.

In India, 24 November is observed as Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s Martyrdom Day (&quot;Shaheedi Diwas&quot;). In certain parts of India, this day of the year is a public holiday. Guru Tegh Bahadur is remembered for giving up his life to protect the freedom of the oppressed to practice their own religion.

The show stars Ray Walston as &quot;Uncle Martin&quot; (the Martian) and Bill Bixby as Tim O&#x27;Hara. The first two seasons, totaling 75 episodes, were in black and white, and the 32 episodes of the third and final season were filmed in color.

John L. Greene created the central characters and developed the core format of the series, which was produced by Jack Chertok.

==Premise==
A human-appearing extraterrestrial in a one-man spaceship nearly collides at high altitude with the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s rocket plane, the North American X-15. The spaceship&#x27;s pilot is a 450-year-old anthropologist from Mars. Tim O&#x27;Hara, a young newspaper reporter for &quot;The Los Angeles Sun&quot;, is on his way home from Edwards Air Force Base, where he had gone to report on the flight of the X-15. Returning home to Los Angeles, O&#x27;Hara spots the same silver spaceship coming down quickly, after which it crash lands nearby.

Tim takes in the Martian, saying to other people that he is Tim&#x27;s Uncle Martin. The Martian refuses to reveal any of his special traits to humans, other than Tim, to avoid both publicity and human panic. Tim agrees to keep the Martian&#x27;s Earth identity a secret while he attempts to repair his spaceship. Uncle Martin has various unusual powers: He can raise two retractable antennae from the back of his head and become invisible; he is telepathic and can read and influence minds; he can levitate objects with the motion of his index finger; he can communicate with animals; he can freeze people or objects; and he can speed himself (and other people) up to do any kind of work.

Also an inventor, Uncle Martin builds several advanced devices, such as a time machine that transports Tim and the Martian to England in the Middle Ages and other times and places, such as St. Louis in 1849 and the early days of Hollywood, and brings Leonardo da Vinci and Jesse James into the present. Another device he builds is a &quot;molecular separator&quot; that can take apart the molecules of a physical object, or rearrange them (making a squirrel into a human). Another device can take memories and store them in pill form to &quot;relearn&quot; them later. Other devices create temporary duplicates, or levitate Martin and others without the need of his index finger.

Tim and Uncle Martin live in a garage apartment owned by a congenial but scatterbrained landlady, Mrs. Lorelei Brown (a former WAVE as revealed in the first episode of season one) who often shows up when not wanted. The Martian and she have an awkward romance from time to time, but Uncle Martin never gets serious for fear of his ultimately going home to Mars. She later dates a vain, cold-hearted, plain-clothes police officer, Detective Bill Brennan, who dislikes Uncle Martin and is highly suspicious of him and his activities.

&quot;Martin O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s&quot; real name is actually Exigius 12. Revealed in the episode &quot;We Love You, Miss Pringle&quot;, it was heard again when his real nephew, Andromeda (played by young actor Wayne Stam), crash-landed on Earth late in the show&#x27;s third season. Andromeda, originally devised to bring younger viewers to the show, disappeared without explanation after this single episode, and was not referred to again in the live-action series&#x27; eight remaining episodes. Andromeda was, however, a regular on the later &quot;My Favorite Martians&quot; animated series. Andromeda had a single antenna, which Martin explained was because his baby antennae had fallen out and only one adult antenna had come in so far. Uncle Martin also reveals that on Mars he lives on Fulton Canal, which ultimately leads to comedic mix-ups and confusion with Canal Fulton, Ohio.

==Production==
===Development and distribution===
The series was produced by Jack Chertok Television in association with CBS Productions. The show was originally syndicated by Wolper Pictures, then it moved to syndicator Telepictures, and finally by successor-in-interest to Warner Bros. Television Distribution. The Chertok Company retained ownership of all copyrights for the series; Rhino Entertainment held U.S. video distribution rights until August 2008. Australian entertainment company Umbrella Entertainment acquired distribution rights for Australia and New Zealand and released seasons one through three (the last in full color) in 2007 and 2008 on region-free DVD. Those rights, together with video streaming, were acquired by Shock Video; in November 2017 Shock released a new complete boxed set of the series using restored show elements. In 2010, MPI Home Video acquired the series distribution rights for home video. In 2018, Pidax Video Germany acquired both streaming and DVD distribution rights for Germany and released the series the same year under its German title &quot;Mein Onkel vom Mars&quot;; As of early July 2013, Warner Bros. held domestic and international syndication rights for the series. Those rights have since returned to the Chertok Trust.

===Music===
The theme music for the series was composed by George Greeley and performed in part on an Electro-Theremin by Paul Tanner, a former member of Glenn Miller&#x27;s band. It was influential in Brian Wilson&#x27;s engagement of Tanner in 1965 and 1966 to work with the Beach Boys on their landmark hit, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Greeley also scored the series; an album of his music from the first two seasons was released by La-La Land Records in 2007 (dedicated to the composer, who died while the album was being prepared).

===Filming===
Unhappy with early script submissions from creator/producer Jack Chertok, the network hired script doctor Sherwood Schwartz to lend a hand. Schwartz changed the Tim-centric scripts to focus more on the Martian, as a &quot;fish out of water&quot;, on, as he termed it &quot;this backwards planet.&quot; The pilot featured Mrs. Brown&#x27;s daughter Annabelle as Tim&#x27;s love interest, but she was dropped to allow Tim to become more of a playboy. In a major change, Mrs. Brown, who was multi-talented, intelligent, and suspicious in the pilot, became decidedly more scatterbrained.
The first two seasons were filmed in black-and-white (at Desilu), but the final season was shot in color (at MGM), resulting in minor changes in the set and the format of the show. In addition to the extraterrestrial powers indicated in the first two seasons, Martin was able to do much more in the final season, such as stimulating mustache growth to provide Tim and himself with quick disguises, and levitating using his nose. Brennan&#x27;s boss, the police chief, was involved in many episodes in the third season, generally as a device to humiliate the overzealous detective Brennan.

===Comparison to other shows===
&quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, which premiered in the fall of 1963, was the first of the &quot;fantasy&quot; situation comedies prevalent on American television in the mid-1960s featuring characters who could do extraordinary things, predating &quot;My Living Doll&quot; (1964–1965), &quot;Bewitched&quot; (1964–1972), and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1965–1970).

==Home media==
Rhino Entertainment released the first two seasons on Region 1 DVD in 2004–2005. Rhino never released the third season. However, the season 3 release from Australia&#x27;s Umbrella Entertainment, on February 5, 2008, was as an import to North America. This release is classified as &quot;Region 0&quot;, making it viewable around the world on any region-free DVD player. Rhino also released a 3-DVD box of &quot;The Best of My Favorite Martian&quot; in 2007, comprising episodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 29, 31, 34, and 37.

In January 2010, MPI Home Video acquired the series&#x27; Region 1 rights under license from the Jack Chertok estate-owned Jack Chertok Productions. At the time, it was announced that they planned on releasing season 3 on DVD in the summer of 2010. This release, however, never materialized and was postponed. It was subsequently released on October 30, 2012.

MPI re-released season 1 on June 24, 2014. and season 2 on December 23, 2014.

On October 20, 2015, MPI Home Video released &quot;My Favorite Martian- The Complete Series&quot;&#x27; on Region 1 DVD.

In Region 4 (Australia), Umbrella Entertainment released all 3 seasons on DVD. These releases are all Region Free. The season 1 release includes special features, such as audio commentary with Ann Marshall, a stills gallery, script, and interview with Ann Marshall. The season 3 release also includes special features, such as an unaired version of the series pilot, behind the scenes home movies, interviews with Stan Frazen, Ted Rich, James Hulsey, and Wayne Stam, as well as audio commentary by James&#x27;s Hulsey and Chertok historian and licensing manager Peter Greenwood. In addition, there are also scans of the original comic series, scripts, and the shooting schedule.

==Reception==
In its first season, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; did very well in the Nielsen ratings, ranking at No. 10. However, by the end of the second season the show had dipped to No. 24. Still, the series was doing well enough to be renewed for a third season. Ratings dipped even further in the third season due to repetitive story lines involving Martin&#x27;s time machine, and the series was canceled.

==Spin-offs==

===Animated series===
An animated series, &quot;My Favorite Martians&quot;, was made by Filmation and was broadcast as part of the Saturday morning programming on CBS from September 8, 1973, to December 22, 1973, for a total of sixteen episodes. The series features Tim, Martin, Mrs. Brown and Detective Brennan (Brennan is considerably different). To appeal to a younger audience, Uncle Martin is joined by his Martian nephew named Andromeda, nicknamed &quot;Andy&quot;, who only has one antenna and thus lesser powers than Uncle Martin and did appear in one episode of the live-action series. The pair also have a Martian pet named Okey, a sort of bouncing sheepdog with antennae. Tim also had a niece of his own, named Katie, living with them. Brennan also had a teenage son named Brad living with him and a pet chimpanzee named Chump. None of the characters were voiced by the original actors; Bixby was at the time committed to his latest project, &quot;The Magician&quot;, and Walston tried to distance himself from the role. As a result, Jonathan Harris voiced Martin and Jane Webb voiced Mrs. Brown.

The cartoon utilized a number of scripts from what would have been season four of the live action show; as of early July 2013, Jack Chertok Television co-owned it, with the Chertok company retaining all merchandising rights to the show.

At least two VHS tape volumes were released of the cartoon series in 1989 by UAV. Distribution rights were held, as of April 2013, by Classic Media as part of their Filmation holdings.

====Episodes====
==In other media==
===Feature film===

The series was also remade as a feature film in 1999 starring Christopher Lloyd as the Martian and Jeff Daniels as Tim. This film was released and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Ray Walston was featured in the film (both Bill Bixby and Pamela Britton had since died; the former in 1993 and the latter in 1974) and played another Martian who had been trapped on Earth since the time of the first series and wore a similar space suit from the series; his cover was now that of a Government investigator of unidentified flying objects. However, the premise was changed: Martians such as Lloyd&#x27;s Uncle Martin are now non-humanoids with four arms, four legs, and three eyes who use a gumball (which they call &quot;nerplex&quot;) to assume human form. The &quot;nerplex&quot; comes in a selection that will turn the person ingesting it into assorted life forms, including Martian, Venusian and one to &quot;never use&quot; (Venox 7).

===Comics===
The TV series was adapted into comic book form by Dan Spiegle and was distributed by Gold Key Comics; it lasted nine issues and ran from 1963 through 1966. Gerry Anderson&#x27;s company Century 21 acquired the rights to produce a comic strip adaptation; it ran in their weekly newspaper, formatted comic TV21, for two years (1965–66) and was featured in three of the British Christmas comics annuals. Unlike the Gold Key Comics adaptation, the British strip, in its later run, featured Martin&#x27;s nephew Andromeda. Due to a lack of reference he was depicted as a chubby freckled British schoolboy.

The comic rights returned to the Chertok company, who licensed a reprint of the Gold Key title produced by Hermes Press. Hermes Press put out one volume of a two volume set that covered issues #1-7 of the Gold Key series. The planned second would complete the Gold Key run and include the TV21 material. They also subsequently issued a special single issue edition reprint for the national free comic book day. That reprint is the only instance of a 1960s television comic reprint being used for this event. Subsequently, during the event, the books, in almost every venue, were the first to sell out. The Chertok Company is actively looking to reprint, for the first time, the British comic adaptation in a single, stand-alone volume. However, the TV21 Martian pages have been used as special features on the US DVD release of the TV series from MPI, for the Australian DVD release from Umbrella Entertainment, and more recently on the Australia New Zealand DVD release from Shock Entertainment.

===Merchandising===
During the show&#x27;s initial run, several products were produced, resulting in a board game, a magic set, a paint by numbers set, and a springs with bells beanie hat.

Licensing resumed in 2012 on the &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; property, resulting in both a scale plastic model kit of Uncle Martin&#x27;s spaceship and a built up version, both from Pegasus Hobbies. Due to the success of the model kit, the Chertok company subsequently has extended the Pegasus license.

The Pegasus model kit is in fact a scale replica based on the Martian spaceship&#x27;s appearance as seen in the series episode &quot;Crash Diet&quot;, where the spaceship is shrunken down in size; the initial version of the shrunken spaceship is in the same scale used for the Pegasus model. A still of Uncle Martin holding that scaled space ship was placed on the back of the product carton for the assembled, non-kit spaceship.

An after-market photo-etched metal detail parts kit from the Paragrafix Company gives modelers the ability to seriously upgrade the model kit&#x27;s cockpit detail. They also for the first time created a scale version of the time machine suitcase, along with offering Uncle Martin&#x27;s flight log book reproduced in both English and Martian text.

Factory Entertainment produced a shake ems version of both Uncle Martin and his spaceship. They also offered a special edition black-and-white version of their Uncle Martin statue as a San Diego Comic-Con exclusive.

In 2015 Greenlight Collectibles produced a prototype &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; boxed set featuring the second season&#x27;s Plymouth Fury, as seen in the show.

In November 2017 Zynga Entertainment added &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; to its cell phone game &quot;Black Diamond Casino&quot;.

<text>The American Dental Association (ADA) is an American professional association established in 1859 which has more than 159,000 members. The ADA is the world&#x27;s largest and oldest national dental association. The organization lobbies on behalf of the American dental profession and provides dental accreditation.

The ADA publishes the &quot;Journal of the American Dental Association&quot; and &quot;JADA Foundational Science&quot;.

As part of its lobbying efforts, the ADA has sought to restrict non-dentists (such as dental hygienists and dental therapists) from providing basic dental care. The organization has played an important role in blocking the inclusion of dental coverage in Medicare. The ADA has expressed opposition to the opening of new dental schools or to increasing the number of dentists in the United States, even as the United States trains almost half as many dental students (relative to population) in the 2000s as it did in the 1980s.

==Overview==

The American Dental Association was founded August 3, 1859, at Niagara Falls, New York, by twenty-six dentists who represented various dental societies in the United States. It is the largest and oldest national dental association in the world.

The association has more than 400 employees at its headquarters in Chicago and its office in Washington, D.C. The Paffenbarger Research Center (PRC), located on the campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, an agency of the American Dental Association Foundation (ADAF) and a Department of the Division of Science. PRC scientists conduct basic and applied studies in clinical research, dental chemistry, polymer chemistry and cariology, and are used by of the ADA.

Historically, the ADA has discriminated against minority dentists and sough to exclude them from its affiliates. This discrimination in part prompted the creation of the National Dental Association. In 2010, the ADA apologized for its history of racial discrimination.

After a Reader&#x27;s Digest investigation revealed that dentists provided drastically different evaluations of the same patients and suggested drastically different treatments, ADA President Leslie Seldin said, &quot;Dentistry is an art based on scientific knowledge, and what&#x27;s most important to all of us is that we each use our professional judgment to design what we believe is the best solution for the patient.&quot;

===Seal of Acceptance===
The ADA established rigorous guidelines for testing and advertising of dental products, and the first ADA Seal of Acceptance was awarded in 1931. Today, about 350 manufacturers participate in the voluntary program and more than 1,300 products have received the Seal of Acceptance.

Product manufacturers are charged $14,500 for each product the ADA evaluates. For products that are approved, manufacturers pay an annual fee of $3,500. According to the ADA, it does not make a profit from the program.

===Organizational structure===
The Board of Trustees, the administrative body of the association, is composed of the president, the president-elect, two vice presidents and 17 trustees from each of the 17 trustee districts in the United States. The treasurer and executive director serve as ex officio members. The House of Delegates, the legislative body of the association, is composed of 460 delegates representing 53 constituent societies, five federal dental services and the American Student Dental Association. The house meets once a year during the association&#x27;s annual session.

The association&#x27;s 11 councils serve as policy recommending agencies. Each council is assigned to study issues relating to its special area of interest and to make recommendations on those matters to the Board of Trustees and the House of Delegates.

The association&#x27;s official publication is the &quot;Journal of the American Dental Association&quot;. Other publications include the ADA News and the ADA Guide to Dental Therapeutics.

The Commission on Dental Accreditation, which operates under the auspices of the ADA, is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as the national accrediting body for dental, advanced dental and allied dental education programs in the United States. It is also recognized by 47 individual states.

The ADA formally recognizes nine specialty areas of dental practice: dental public health, endodontics, oral and maxillofacial pathology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial radiology.

The ADA Foundation is the charitable arm of the association.

==Advocacy==

The ADA opposes the opening of new dental schools and increases in the number of dental students. The organization has questioned federal data showing a dentist shortage in the United States. In the 1980s, dental schools graduated nearly twice as many students relative to total population as they did in the 2000s.

The ADA has a history of trying to restrict the kind of care that dental hygienists and dental therapists are allowed to provide. In many states, dental hygienists are required to be closely supervised by dentists when they provide care. In 1991, the Director of the ADA&#x27;s Council on Dental Practice expressed opposition to permit dental hygienists to work unsupervised, arguing that this would harm patients and that dental hygienists &quot;need the dentists to review their work.&quot;

In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission proposed to create a category of mid-level practitioners (dental therapists) to provide some routine dental services, which &quot;could benefit consumers by increasing choice, competition, and access to care, especially for the underserved.&quot; The ADA lobbied against the proposal, arguing that the government should rather give more funding to dentists than allow &quot;lesser trained&quot; therapists to provide dental services. The ADA spent millions of dollars to block legislative proposals in various states to permit dental therapists to provide services. The ADA&#x27;s own research has shown that when dentists work with dental therapists, the rate of untreated caries was lower than in dentist-only teams.

The ADA has a long history of advocating against dental coverage under national health insurance plans. In 1965, the ADA lobbied against the inclusion of dental coverage in the original Medicare program. In 2021, the ADA launched a well-funded lobbying effort against proposal to provide dental insurance coverage for all Medicare recipients. The ADA stands in contrast to the National Dental Association, which has advocated for universal dental coverage for Medicare recipients. In 2021, ADA president Cesar R. Sabates credited the exclusion of Medicare dental coverage in the Build Back Better Plan to the ADA&#x27;s advocacy.

Critics of the ADA argue that the organization undermines competition in dental services and makes dental care in the United States less affordable. The ADA has also been described as an &quot;old boys club&quot; where licensed dentists, 70% of whom are male, restrict the kinds of services that dental hygienists (more than 95% of whom are female) can provide.

<text>Mādhyamaka (&quot;middle way&quot; or &quot;centrism&quot;; ; ; Tibetan: དབུ་མ་པ་ ; &quot;dbu ma pa&quot;), otherwise known as Śūnyavāda (&quot;the emptiness doctrine&quot;) and Niḥsvabhāvavāda (&quot;the no &quot;svabhāva&quot; doctrine&quot;), refers to a tradition of Buddhist philosophy and practice founded by the Indian Buddhist monk and philosopher Nāgārjuna (). The foundational text of the Mādhyamaka tradition is Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (&quot;Root Verses on the Middle Way&quot;). More broadly, Mādhyamaka also refers to the ultimate nature of phenomena as well as the non-conceptual realization of ultimate reality that is experienced in meditation.

Since the 4th century CE onwards, Mādhyamaka philosophy had a major influence on the subsequent development of the Mahāyāna Buddhist tradition, especially following the spread of Buddhism throughout Asia. It is the dominant interpretation of Buddhist philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism and has also been influential in East Asian Buddhist thought.

According to the classical Indian Mādhyamika thinkers, all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) are empty (&quot;śūnya&quot;) of &quot;nature&quot;, of any &quot;substance&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; (&quot;svabhāva&quot;) which could give them &quot;solid and independent existence&quot;, because they are dependently co-arisen. But this &quot;emptiness&quot; itself is also &quot;empty&quot;: it does not have an existence on its own, nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond or above phenomenal reality.

==Etymology==

&quot;Madhya&quot; is a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;middle&quot;. It is cognate with Latin &quot;med-iu-s&quot; and English &quot;mid&quot;. The &quot;-ma&quot; suffix is a superlative, giving &quot;madhyama&quot; the meaning of &quot;mid-most&quot; or &quot;medium&quot;. The &quot;-ka&quot; suffix is used to form adjectives, thus &quot;madhyamaka&quot; means &quot;middling&quot;. The &quot;-ika&quot; suffix is used to form possessives, with a collective sense, thus &quot;mādhyamika&quot; mean &quot;belonging to the mid-most&quot; (the &quot;-ika&quot; suffix regularly causes a lengthening of the first vowel and elision of the final &quot;-a&quot;).

In a Buddhist context, these terms refer to the &quot;middle path&quot; (&quot;madhyama pratipada&quot;), which refers to right view (&quot;samyagdṛṣṭi&quot;) which steers clear of the metaphysical extremes of annihilationism (&quot;ucchedavāda&quot;) and eternalism (&quot;śasvatavāda&quot;). For example, the Sanskrit &quot;Kātyāyanaḥsūtra&quot; states that though the world &quot;relies on a duality of existence and non-existence&quot;, the Buddha teaches a correct view which understands that:Arising in the world, Kātyayana, seen and correctly understood just as it is, shows there is no non-existence in the world. Cessation in the world, Kātyayana, seen and correctly understood just as it is, shows there is no permanent existence in the world. Thus avoiding both extremes the Tathāgata teaches a dharma by the middle path (&quot;madhyamayā pratipadā&quot;). That is: this being, that becomes; with the arising of this, that arises. With ignorance as condition there is volition ... [to be expanded with the standard formula of the 12 links of dependent origination]Though all Buddhist schools saw themselves as defending a middle path in accord with the Buddhist teachings, the name &quot;Madhyamaka&quot; refers to a school of Mahayana philosophy associated with Nāgārjuna and his commentators. The term &quot;Mādhyamika&quot; refers to adherents of the Madhyamaka school. Note that in both words the stress is on the first syllable.

==Philosophical overview==
=== Svabhāva, what Madhyamaka denies ===

Central to Madhyamaka philosophy is &quot;śūnyatā&quot;, &quot;emptiness&quot;, and this refers to the central idea that dharmas are empty of &quot;svabhāva&quot;. This term has been translated variously as essence, intrinsic nature, inherent existence, own being and substance. Furthermore, according to Richard P. Hayes, &quot;svabhāva&quot; can be interpreted as either &quot;identity&quot; or as &quot;causal independence&quot;. Likewise, Westerhoff notes that &quot;svabhāva&quot; is a complex concept that has ontological and cognitive aspects. The ontological aspects include &quot;svabhāva&quot; as essence, as a property which makes an object what it is, as well as &quot;svabhāva&quot; as substance, meaning, as the Madhyamaka thinker Candrakīrti defines it, something that does &quot;not depend on anything else&quot;.

It is substance-&quot;svabhāva&quot;, the objective and independent existence of any object or concept, which Madhyamaka arguments mostly focus on refuting. A common structure which Madhyamaka uses to negate &quot;svabhāva&quot; is the &quot;catuṣkoṭi&quot; (&quot;four corners&quot; or tetralemma), which roughly consists of four alternatives: a proposition is true; a proposition is false; a proposition is both true and false; a proposition is neither true nor false. Some of the major topics discussed by classical Madhyamaka include causality, change, and personal identity.

Madhyamaka&#x27;s denial of &quot;svabhāva&quot; does not mean a nihilistic denial of all things, for in a conventional everyday sense, Madhyamaka does accept that one can speak of &quot;things&quot;, and yet &quot;ultimately&quot; these things are empty of inherent existence. Furthermore, &quot;emptiness&quot; itself is also &quot;empty&quot;: it does not have an existence on its own, nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond or above phenomenal reality.

&quot;Svabhāva&quot;&#x27;s cognitive aspect is merely a superimposition (&quot;samāropa&quot;) that beings make when they perceive and conceive of things. In this sense then, emptiness does not exist as some kind of primordial reality, but it is simply a corrective to a mistaken conception of how things exist. This idea of &quot;svabhāva&quot; that Madhyamaka denies is then not just a conceptual philosophical theory, but it is a cognitive distortion that beings automatically impose on the world, such as when we regard the five aggregates as constituting a single self. Candrakirti compares it to someone who suffers from vitreous floaters that cause the illusion of hairs appearing in their visual field. This cognitive dimension of &quot;svabhāva&quot; means that just understanding and assenting to Madhyamaka reasoning is not enough to end the suffering caused by our reification of the world, just like understanding how an optical illusion works does not make it stop functioning. What is required is a kind of cognitive shift (termed &quot;realization&quot;) in the way the world appears and therefore some kind of practice to lead to this shift. As Candrakirti says:

For one on the road of cyclic existence who pursues an inverted view due to ignorance, a mistaken object such as the superimposition (&quot;samāropa&quot;) on the aggregates appears as real, but it does not appear to one who is close to the view of the real nature of things.

Much of Madhyamaka philosophy centers on showing how various essentialist ideas have absurd conclusions through &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; arguments (known as &quot;prasanga&quot; in Sanskrit). Chapter 15 of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; centers on the words svabhava parabhava bhava and abhava. According to Peter Harvey:

An important element of Madhyamaka refutation is that the classical Buddhist doctrine of dependent arising (the idea that every phenomena is dependent on other phenomena) cannot be reconciled with &quot;a conception of self-nature or substance&quot; and that therefore essence theories are contrary not only to the Buddhist scriptures but to the very ideas of causality and change. Any enduring essential nature would prevent any causal interaction, or any kind of origination. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change. As Nāgārjuna writes in the MMK:

We state that conditioned origination is emptiness. It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path. (24.18)

Since nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is nothing that is not empty. (24.19)

=== The two truths ===
Beginning with Nāgārjuna, Madhyamaka discerns two levels of truth, conventional truth (everyday commonsense reality) and ultimate truth (emptiness). Ultimately, Madhyamaka argues that all phenomena are empty of &quot;svabhava&quot; and only exist in dependence on other causes, conditions and concepts. Conventionally, Madhyamaka holds that beings do perceive concrete objects which they are aware of empirically. In Madhyamaka this phenomenal world is the limited truth – &quot;saṃvṛti satya,&quot; which means &quot;to cover&quot;, &quot;to conceal&quot;, or &quot;obscure&quot;. (and thus it is a kind of ignorance) Saṃvṛti is also said to mean &quot;conventional&quot;, as in a customary, norm based, agreed upon truth (like linguistic conventions) and it is also glossed as &quot;vyavahāra-satya&quot; (transactional truth). Finally, Chandrakirti also has a third explanation of saṃvṛti, which is &quot;mutual dependence&quot; (&quot;parasparasaṃbhavana&quot;).

This seeming reality does not &quot;really&quot; exist as the highest truth realized by wisdom which is &quot;paramartha satya&quot; (&quot;parama&quot; is literally &quot;supreme or ultimate&quot;, and &quot;artha&quot; means &quot;object, purpose, or actuality&quot;), and yet it has a kind of conventional reality which has its uses for reaching liberation. This limited truth includes everything, including the Buddha himself, the teachings (dharma), liberation and even Nāgārjuna&#x27;s own arguments. This two truth schema which did not deny the importance of convention allowed Nāgārjuna to defend himself against charges of nihilism; understanding both correctly meant seeing the middle way:

&quot;Without relying upon convention, the ultimate fruit is not taught. Without understanding the ultimate, nirvana is not attained.&quot;

The limited, perceived reality is an experiential reality or a nominal reality which beings impute on the ultimate reality. It is not an ontological reality with substantial or independent existence. Hence, the two truths are not two metaphysical realities; instead, according to Karl Brunnholzl, &quot;the two realities refer to just what is experienced by two different types of beings with different types and scopes of perception&quot;. As Candrakirti says:

It is through the perfect and the false seeing of all entities

That the entities that are thus found bear two natures.

The object of perfect seeing is true reality,

And false seeing is seeming reality.

This means that the distinction between the two truths is primarily epistemological and dependent on the cognition of the observer, not ontological. As Shantideva writes, there are &quot;two kinds of world&quot;, &quot;the one of yogins and the one of common people&quot;. The seeming reality is the world of samsara because conceiving of concrete and unchanging objects leads to clinging and suffering. As Buddhapalita states: &quot;unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them&quot;.

According to Hayes, the two truths may also refer to two different goals in life: the highest goal of nirvana, and the lower goal of &quot;commercial good&quot;. The highest goal is the liberation from attachment, both material &quot;and&quot; intellectual.

=== The nature of ultimate reality ===
According to Paul Williams, Nāgārjuna associates emptiness with the ultimate truth but his conception of emptiness is not some kind of Absolute, but rather it is the very absence of true existence with regards to the conventional reality of things and events in the world. Because the ultimate is itself empty, it is also explained as a &quot;transcendence of deception&quot; and hence is a kind of apophatic truth which experiences the lack of substance.

Because the nature of ultimate reality is said to be empty, empty even of &quot;emptiness&quot; itself, both the concept of &quot;emptiness&quot; and the very framework of the two truths are also mere conventional realities, not part of the ultimate. This is often called &quot;the emptiness of emptiness&quot; and refers to the fact that even though madhyamikas speak of emptiness as the ultimate unconditioned nature of things, this emptiness is itself empty of any real existence.

The two truths themselves are therefore just a practical tool used to teach others, but do not exist within the actual meditative equipoise that realizes the ultimate. As Candrakirti says: &quot;the noble ones who have accomplished what is to be accomplished do not see anything that is delusive or not delusive&quot;. From within the experience of the enlightened ones there is only one reality which appears non-conceptually, as Nāgārjuna says in the Sixty stanzas on reasoning: &quot;that nirvana is the sole reality, is what the Victors have declared.&quot; Bhāvaviveka&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakahrdayakārikā&quot; describes the ultimate truth through a negation of all four possibilities of the &quot;catuskoti&quot;:

Its character is neither existent, nor nonexistent, / Nor both existent and nonexistent, nor neither. / Centrists should know true reality / That is free from these four possibilities.

Atisha describes the ultimate as &quot;here, there is no seeing and no seer, no beginning and no end, just peace... It is nonconceptual and nonreferential ... it is inexpressible, unobservable, unchanging, and unconditioned.&quot; Because of the non-conceptual nature of the ultimate, according to Brunnholzl, the two truths are ultimately inexpressible as either &quot;one&quot; or &quot;different&quot;.

=== The Middle Way ===
As noted by Roger Jackson, some non-Buddhist writers, like some Buddhist writers both ancient and modern, have argued that the Madhyamaka philosophy is nihilistic. This claim has been challenged by others who argue that it is a Middle Way (&quot;madhyamāpratipad&quot;) between nihilism and eternalism. Madhyamaka philosophers themselves explicitly rejected the nihilist interpretation from the outset: Nāgārjuna writes: &quot;through explaining true reality as it is, the seeming &quot;samvrti&quot; does not become disrupted.&quot; Candrakirti also responds to the charge of nihilism in his &quot;Lucid Words&quot;:

Therefore, emptiness is taught in order to completely pacify all discursiveness without exception. So if the purpose of emptiness is the complete peace of all discursiveness and you just increase the web of discursiveness by thinking that the meaning of emptiness is nonexistence, you do not realize the purpose of emptiness [at all].

This although some scholars (e.g., Murti) interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental absolute, other scholars (such as David Kalupahana) consider this claim a mistake, since then emptiness teachings could not be characterized as a middle way.

Madhyamaka thinkers also argue that since things have the nature of lacking true existence or own being (&quot;niḥsvabhāva&quot;), all things are mere conceptual constructs (&quot;prajñaptimatra&quot;) because they are just impermanent collections of causes and conditions. This also applies to the principle of causality itself, since &quot;everything&quot; is dependently originated. Therefore, in Madhyamaka, phenomena appear to arise and cease, but in an ultimate sense they do not arise or remain as inherently existent phenomena. This tenet is held to show that views of absolute or eternalist existence (such as the Hindu ideas of Brahman or &quot;sat-dravya&quot;) and nihilism are both equally untenable. These two views are considered to be the &quot;two extremes&quot; that Madhyamaka steers clear from. The first is &quot;essentialism&quot; or &quot;eternalism&quot; (sastavadava) – a belief that things inherently or substantially exist and are therefore efficacious objects of craving and clinging; Nagarjuna argues that we naively and innately perceive things as substantial, and it is this predisposition which is the root delusion that lies at the basis of all suffering. The second extreme is &quot;nihilism&quot; or &quot;annihilationism&quot; (ucchedavada) – encompassing views that could lead one to believe that there is no need to be responsible for one&#x27;s actions – such as the idea that one is annihilated at death or that nothing has causal effects – but also the view that absolutely nothing exists.

=== The usefulness of reason ===
In Madhyamaka, reason and debate are understood as a means to an end (liberation), and therefore they must be founded on the wish to help oneself and others end suffering. Reason and logical arguments, however (such as those employed by classical Indian philosophers, i.e., &quot;pramana&quot;), are also seen as being empty of any true validity or reality. They serve only as conventional remedies for our delusions. Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī&quot; famously attacked the notion that one could establish a valid cognition or epistemic proof (&quot;pramana&quot;):

If your objects are well established through valid cognitions, tell us how you establish these valid cognitions. If you think they are established through other valid cognitions, there is an infinite regress. Then, the first one is not established, nor are the middle ones, nor the last. If these [valid cognitions] are established even without valid cognition, what you say is ruined. In that case, there is an inconsistency, And you ought to provide an argument for this distinction.

Candrakirti comments on this statement by stating that Madhyamaka does not completely deny the use of pramanas conventionally, and yet ultimately they do not have a foundation:

Therefore we assert that mundane objects are known through the four kinds of authoritative cognition. They are mutually dependent: when there is authoritative cognition, there are objects of knowledge; when there are objects of knowledge, there is authoritative cognition. But neither authoritative cognition nor objects of knowledge exist inherently.

To the charge that if Nāgārjuna&#x27;s arguments and words are also empty they therefore lack the power to refute anything, Nāgārjuna responds that:

My words are without nature. Therefore, my thesis is not ruined. Since there is no inconsistency, I do not have to state an argument for a distinction.Nāgārjuna goes on:

Just as one magical creation may be annihilated by another magical creation, and one illusory person by another person produced by an illusionist, this negation is the same.Shantideva makes the same point: &quot;thus, when one&#x27;s son dies in a dream, the conception &quot;he does not exist&quot; removes the thought that he does exist, but it is also delusive&quot;. In other words, Madhyamaka thinkers accept that their arguments, just like all things, are not &quot;ultimately&quot; valid in some foundational sense. But one is still able to use the opponent&#x27;s own reasoning apparatus in the conventional field to refute their theories and help them see their errors. This remedial deconstruction does not replace false theories of existence with other ones, but simply dissolves all views, including the very fictional system of epistemic warrants (&quot;pramanas&quot;) used to establish them. The point of Madhyamaka reasoning is not to establish any abstract validity or universal truth, it is simply a pragmatic project aimed at ending delusion and suffering.

Nāgārjuna also argues that Madhyamaka only negates things conventionally, since ultimately, there is nothing there to negate: &quot;I do not negate anything and there is also nothing to be negated.&quot; Therefore, it is only from the perspective of those who cling to the existence of things that it seems as if something is being negated. In truth, Madhyamaka is not annihilating something, merely elucidating that this so-called existence never existed in the first place.

Thus, Madhyamaka uses language to make clear the limits of our concepts. Ultimately, reality cannot be depicted by concepts. According to Jay Garfield, this creates a sort of tension in Madhyamaka literature, since it has use some concepts to convey its teachings.

=== Soteriology ===

For Madhyamaka, the realization of emptiness is not just a satisfactory theory about the world, but a key understanding which allows one to reach liberation or nirvana. As Nāgārjuna&#x27;s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (&quot;Root Verses on the Middle Way&quot;) puts it:

With the cessation of ignorance, formations will not arise. Moreover, the cessation of ignorance occurs through right understanding. Through the cessation of this and that, this and that will not come about. The entire mass of suffering thereby completely ceases.

The words &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; allude to the mind&#x27;s profound addiction to dualism, but also and more specifically to the mind that has not yet grasped the reality of dependent origination. The insight of dependent origination – that nothing arises or happens independently, that everything is rooted in or &quot;made of&quot; something else, and conditioned by other things, each of which are likewise made of and conditioned by other things in the same way, so that nothing at all &quot;is&quot; independently – is central to the fundamental Buddhist analysis of the arising of suffering and the liberation from it. Therefore, according to Nāgārjuna, the cognitive shift which sees the nonexistence of &quot;svabhāva&quot; leads to the cessation of the first link in this chain of suffering, which then leads to the ending of the entire chain of causes and thus, of all suffering. Nāgārjuna adds:

Liberation (&quot;moksa&quot;) results from the cessation of actions (&quot;karman&quot;) and defilements (&quot;klesa&quot;). Actions and defilements result from representations (&quot;vikalpa&quot;). These [come] from false imagining (&quot;prapañca&quot;). False imagining stops in emptiness (&quot;sunyata&quot;). (18.5)

Therefore, the ultimate aim of understanding emptiness is not philosophical insight as such, but the actualization of a liberated mind which does not cling to anything. To encourage this awakening, meditation on emptiness may proceed in stages, starting with the emptiness of self, of objects and of mental states, culminating in a &quot;natural state of nonreferential freedom&quot;.

Moreover, the path to understanding ultimate truth is not one that negates or invalidates relative truths (especially truths about the path to awakening). Instead it is only through properly understanding and using relative truth that the ultimate can be attained, as Bhāvaviveka maintains:

In order to guide beginners a method is taught, comparable to the steps of a staircase that leads to perfect Buddhahood. Ultimate reality is only to be entered once we have understood seeming reality.

=== Does Madhyamaka have a position? ===
Nāgārjuna is famous for arguing that his philosophy was not a view, and that he in fact did not take any position (&quot;paksa&quot;) or thesis (&quot;pratijña&quot;) whatsoever since this would just be another form of clinging to some form of existence. In his &quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī&quot; , Nāgārjuna states:

If I had any position, I thereby would be at fault. Since I have no position, I am not at fault at all. If there were anything to be observed through direct perception and the other instances [of valid cognition], it would be something to be established or rejected. However, since no such thing exists, I cannot be criticized.

Likewise in his &quot;Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning&quot;, Nāgārjuna says: &quot;By taking any standpoint whatsoever, you will be snatched by the cunning snakes of the afflictions. Those whose minds have no standpoint will not be caught.&quot;

Randall Collins argues that for Nāgārjuna, ultimate reality is simply the idea that &quot;no concepts are intelligible&quot;, while Ferrer emphasizes that Nāgārjuna criticized those whose mind held any &quot;positions and beliefs&quot;, &quot;including&quot; the view of emptiness. As Nāgārjuna says: &quot;The Victorious Ones have announced that emptiness is the relinquishing of all views. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible.&quot; Aryadeva echoes this idea in his Four Hundred Verses:

&quot;First, one puts an end to what is not meritorious. In the middle, one puts an end to identity. Later, one puts an end to all views. Those who understand this are skilled.&quot;

Other writers, however, do seem to affirm emptiness as a specific Madhyamaka thesis or view. Shantideva for example says &quot;one cannot uphold any faultfinding in the thesis of emptiness&quot; and Bhavaviveka&#x27;s &quot;Blaze of Reasoning&quot; says: &quot;as for our thesis, it is the emptiness of nature, because this is the nature of phenomena&quot;. Jay Garfield notes that Nāgārjuna and Candrakirti both make positive arguments, and cites both the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (&quot;Root Verses on the Middle Way&quot;) – &quot;There does not exist anything that is not dependently arisen. Therefore there does not exist anything that is not empty&quot; – and Candrakirti&#x27;s commentary on it: &quot;We assert the statement, &#x27;Emptiness itself is a designation.

These positions are not really in contradiction, however, since Madhyamaka can be said to have the &quot;thesis of emptiness&quot; only conventionally, in the context of debating or explaining it. According to Karl Brunnholzl, even though Madhyamaka thinkers may express a thesis pedagogically, what they deny is that &quot;they have any thesis that involves real existence or reference points, or any thesis that is to be defended from their own point of view&quot;.

Brunnholzl underlines that Madhyamaka analysis applies to all systems of thought, ideas and concepts, including Madhyamaka itself. This is because the nature of Madhyamaka is &quot;the deconstruction of any system and conceptualization whatsoever, including itself&quot;. In the Root verses on the Middle Way, Nāgārjuna illustrates this point:

By the flaw of having views about emptiness, those of little understanding are ruined, just as when incorrectly seizing a snake or mistakenly practicing an awareness-mantra.

==Origins and sources==
The Madhyamaka school is usually considered to have been founded by Nāgārjuna, though it may have existed earlier. Various scholars have noted that some of themes in the work of Nāgārjuna can also be found in earlier Buddhist sources.

=== Early Buddhist Texts ===
It is well known that the only sutra that Nāgārjuna explicitly cites in his &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (Chapter 15.7) is the &quot;Advice to Kātyāyana&quot;. He writes, &quot;according to the Instructions to Kātyāyana, both existence and nonexistence are criticized by the Blessed One who opposed being and non-being.&quot; This appears to have been a Sanskrit version of the &quot;Kaccānagotta Sutta&quot; (Saṃyutta Nikāya ii.16–17 / SN 12.15, with parallel in the Chinese &quot;Saṃyuktāgama&quot; 301). The &quot;Kaccānagotta Sutta&quot; itself says:

This world, Kaccāna, for the most part depends on a duality – upon the notion of existence and the notion of nonexistence. But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard to the world.

Joseph Walser also points out that verse six of chapter 15 contains an allusion to the &quot;Mahahatthipadopama sutta&quot;, another early sutra of the &quot;Nidanavagga&quot;, the collection which also contains the &quot;Kaccānagotta,&quot; and which contains various sutras that focus on the avoidance of extreme views, which are all held to be associated with either the extreme of eternality (&quot;sasvata&quot;) or the extreme of disruption (&quot;uccheda&quot;). Another allusion to an early Buddhist text noted by Walser occurs in Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Ratnavali&quot; chapter 1, where he makes reference to a statement in the &quot;Kevaddha sutta.&quot;

Some scholars, like Tillman Vetter and Luis Gomez, have also seen some passages from the early &quot;Aṭṭhakavagga&quot; (Pali, &quot;Octet Chapter&quot;) and the &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot; (Pali, &quot;Way to the Far Shore Chapter&quot;), which focusing on letting go of all views, as teaching a kind of &quot;Proto-Mādhyamika.&quot; Other scholars such as Paul Fuller and Alexander Wynne have rejected the arguments of Gomez and Vetter.

Finally, the &quot;Dazhidulun&quot;, a text attributed to Nāgārjuna in the Chinese tradition (though this attribution has been questioned), cites the Sanskrit &quot;Arthavargīya sūtra&quot; (which parallels the &quot;Aṭṭhakavagga&quot;) in its discussion of ultimate truth.

=== Abhidharma and early Buddhist schools ===
The Madhyamaka school has been perhaps simplistically regarded as a reaction against the development of Buddhist abhidharma, however according to Joseph Walser, this is problematic. In abhidharma, dharmas are characterized by defining traits (&quot;lakṣaṇa&quot;) or own-existence (&quot;svabhāva&quot;). The &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot; states for example: &quot;&quot;dharma&quot; means &#x27;upholding,&#x27; [namely], upholding intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;)&quot;, while the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣā&quot; states &quot;intrinsic nature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it&quot;. However this does not mean that all abhidharma systems hold that dharmas exist independently in an ontological sense, since all Buddhist schools hold that (most) dharmas are dependently originated, this doctrine being a central core Buddhist view. Therefore, in abhidharma, &quot;svabhāva&quot; is typically something which arises dependent on other conditions and qualities.

&quot;Svabhāva&quot; in the early abhidharma systems then, is not a kind of ontological essentialism, but it is a way to categorize dharmas according to their distinctive characteristics. According to Noa Ronkin, the idea of &quot;svabhava&quot; evolved towards ontological dimension in the Sarvāstivādin Vaibhasika school&#x27;s interpretation, which began to also use the term &quot;dravya&quot; which means &quot;real existence&quot;. This then, may have been the shift which Nagarjuna sought to attack when he targets certain Sarvastivada tenets.

However, the relationship between Madhyamaka and abhidharma is complex, as Joseph Walser notes, &quot;Nagarjuna&#x27;s position vis-à-vis abhidharma is neither a blanket denial nor a blanket acceptance. Nagarjuna&#x27;s arguments entertain certain abhidharmic standpoints while refuting others.&quot; One example can be seen in Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Ratnavali&quot; which supports the study of a list of 57 moral faults which Nagarjuna takes from the &quot;Ksudravastuka&quot; (an abhidharma texts that is part of the Sarvastivada &quot;Dharmaskandha&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Abhidharmic analysis figures prominently in Madhyamaka treatises, and authoritative commentators like Candrakīrti emphasize that abhidharmic categories function as a viable (and favored) system of conventional truths – they are more refined than ordinary categories, and they are not dependent on either the extreme of eternalism or on the extreme view of the discontinuity of karma, as the non-Buddhist categories of the time did.

Walser also notes that Nagarjuna&#x27;s theories have much in common with the view of a sub-sect of the Mahasamgikas called the Prajñaptivadins, who held that suffering was &quot;prajñapti&quot; (designation by provisional naming) &quot;based on conditioned entities that are themselves reciprocally designated&quot; (&quot;anyonya prajñapti&quot;). David Burton argues that for Nagarjuna, &quot;dependently arisen entities have merely conceptually constructed existence (&quot;prajñaptisat&quot;)&quot;. Commenting on this, Walser writes that &quot;Nagarjuna is arguing for a thesis that the Prajñaptivádins already held, using a concept of prajñapti that they were already using.&quot;

=== Mahāyāna sūtras ===
According to David Seyfort Ruegg, the main canonical Mahāyāna sutra sources of the Madhyamaka school are the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot;, &quot;Ratnakūṭa&quot; and &quot;Avataṃsaka&quot; literature. Other sutras which were widely cited by Madhamikas include the &quot;Vimalakīrtinirdeṣa&quot;, the &quot;Śuraṃgamasamādhi,&quot; the &quot;Saddharmapuṇḍarīka&quot;, the &quot;Daśabhūmika&quot;, the &quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa&quot;, the &quot;Tathāgataguhyaka&quot;, and the &quot;Kāśyapaparivarta&quot;.

Ruegg notes that in Candrakīrti&#x27;s &quot;Prasannapadā&quot; and &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;, in addition to the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot;, &quot;we find the &quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa, Anavataptahradāpasaṃkramaṇa, Upāliparipṛcchā, Kāśyapaparivarta, Gaganagañja, Tathāgataguhya, Daśabhūmika, Dṛḍhādhyāśaya, Dhāraṇīśvararāja, Pitāputrasamāgama, Mañjuśrīparipṛcchā, Ratnakūṭa, Ratnacūḍaparipṛcchā, Ratnamegha, Ratnākara, Laṅkāvatāra, Lalitavistara, Vimalakirtinirdesa, Śālistamba, Satyadvayāvatāra&quot;, &quot;Saddharmapuṇḍarīka&quot;, &quot;Samādhirāja&quot; (&quot;Candrapradīpa&quot;), and &quot;Hastikakṣya&quot;.&quot;

===Prajñāpāramitā===
Madhyamaka thought is also closely related to a number of Mahāyāna sources; traditionally, the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; sūtras are the literature most closely associated with Madhyamaka – understood, at least in part, as an exegetical complement to those Sūtras. Traditional accounts also depict Nāgārjuna as retrieving some of the larger Prajñāpāramitā sūtras from the world of the Nāgas (explaining in part the etymology of his name). Prajñā or &#x27;higher cognition&#x27; is a recurrent term in Buddhist texts, explained as a synonym of abhidharma, &#x27;insight&#x27; (vipaśyanā) and &#x27;analysis of the dharmas&#x27; (&quot;dharmapravicaya&quot;). Within a specifically Mahāyāna context, Prajñā figures as the most prominent in a list of Six Pāramitās (&#x27;perfections&#x27; or &#x27;perfect masteries&#x27;) that a Bodhisattva needs to cultivate in order to eventually achieve Buddhahood.

Madhyamaka offers conceptual tools to analyze all possible elements of existence, allowing the practitioner to elicit through reasoning and contemplation the type of view that the Sūtras express more authoritatively (being considered word of the Buddha) but less explicitly (not offering corroborative arguments). The vast Prajñāpāramitā literature emphasizes the development of higher cognition in the context of the Bodhisattva path; thematically, its focus on the emptiness of all dharmas is closely related to the Madhyamaka approach. Allusions to the prajñaparamita sutras can be found in Nagarjuna&#x27;s work. One example is in the opening stanza of the MMK, which seem to allude to the following statement found in two prajñaparamita texts (&quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā&quot; and &quot;Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā&quot;):And how does he wisely know conditioned co-production? He wisely knows it as neither production, nor stopping, neither cut off nor eternal, neither single nor manifold, neither coming nor going away, as the appeasement of all futile discoursings, and as bliss.The first stanza of Nagarjuna&#x27;s MMK meanwhile, state:I pay homage to the Fully Enlightened One whose true, venerable words teach dependent-origination to be the blissful pacification of all mental proliferation, neither production, nor stopping, neither cut off nor eternal, neither single nor manifold, neither coming, nor going away.

===Pyrrhonism===

Because of the high degree of similarity between Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonism, Thomas McEvilley and Matthew Neale suspect that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. Pyrrho of Elis (), who is credited with founding this school of skeptical philosophy, was himself influenced by Buddhist philosophy during his stay in India with Alexander the Great&#x27;s army.

== Indian Madhyamaka ==
=== Nāgārjuna ===
As Jan Westerhoff notes, while Nāgārjuna is &quot;one of the greatest thinkers in the history of Asian philosophy...contemporary scholars agree on hardly any details concerning him&quot;. This includes exactly when he lived (it can be narrowed down some time in the first three centuries CE), where he lived (Joseph Walser suggests Amarāvatī in east Deccan) and exactly what constitutes his written corpus.

Numerous texts are attributed to him, but it is at least agreed by some scholars that what is called the &quot;Yukti&quot; (analytical) corpus is the core of his philosophical work. These texts are the &quot;Root verses on the Middle way&quot; (&quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā,&quot; MMK), the &quot;Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning&quot; (&quot;Yuktiṣāṣṭika&quot;), the &quot;Dispeller of Objections&quot; (&quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī&quot;), the &quot;Treatise on Pulverization&quot; (&quot;Vaidalyaprakaraṇa&quot;) and the &quot;Precious Garland&quot; (&quot;Ratnāvalī&quot;). However, even the attribution of each one of these has been question by some modern scholars, except for the MMK which is by definition seen as his major work.

Nāgārjuna&#x27;s main goal is often seen by scholars as refuting the essentialism of certain Buddhist abhidharma schools (mainly &quot;Vaibhasika&quot;) which posited theories of &quot;svabhava&quot; (essential nature) and also the Hindu Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools which posited a theory of ontological substances (&quot;dravyatas&quot;). In the MMK he used &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; arguments (&quot;prasanga&quot;) to show that any theory of substance or essence was unsustainable and therefore, phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) such as change, causality, and sense perception were empty (&quot;sunya&quot;) of any essential existence. Nāgārjuna also famously equated the emptiness of &quot;dharmas&quot; with their dependent origination.

Because of his philosophical work, Nāgārjuna is seen by some modern interpreters as restoring the Middle Way of the Buddha, which had become challenged by absolutist metaphysical tendencies in certain philosophical quarters.

=== Classical Madhyamaka figures ===

Rāhulabhadra was an early madhyamika, sometimes said to be either a teacher of Nagarjuna or his contemporary and follower. He is most famous for his verses in praise of the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; (Skt. &quot;Prajñāpāramitāstotra&quot;) and Chinese sources maintain that he also composed a commentary on the MMK which was translated by Paramartha.

Nāgārjuna&#x27;s pupil Āryadeva (3rd century CE) wrote various works on Madhyamaka, the most well known of which is his &quot;400 verses&quot;. His works are regarded as a supplement to Nāgārjuna&#x27;s, on which he commented. Āryadeva also wrote refutations of the theories of non-Buddhist Indian philosophical schools.

There are also two commentaries on the MMK which may be by Āryadeva, the &quot;Akutobhaya&quot; (which has also been regarded as an auto-commentary by Nagarjuna) as well as a commentary which survives only in Chinese (as part of the &quot;Chung-Lun&quot;, &quot;Middle treatise&quot;, Taisho 1564) attributed to a certain &quot;Ch&#x27;ing-mu&quot; (aka Pin-lo-chieh, which some scholars have also identified as possibly being Aryadeva). However, Brian C. Bocking, a translator of the &quot;Chung-Lung&quot;, also states that it is likely the author of this commentary was a certain Vimalāksa, who was Kumarajiva&#x27;s old Vinaya-master from Kucha.

An influential commentator on Nāgārjuna was Buddhapālita (470–550) who has been interpreted as developing the prāsaṅgika approach to Nāgārjuna&#x27;s works in his &quot;Madhyamakavṛtti&quot; (now only extant in Tibetan) which follows the orthodox Madhyamaka method by critiquing essentialism mainly through reductio ad absurdum arguments. Like Nāgārjuna, Buddhapālita&#x27;s main philosophical method is to show how all philosophical positions are ultimately untenable and self-contradictory, a style of argumentation called &quot;prasanga&quot;.

Buddhapālita&#x27;s method is often contrasted with that of Bhāvaviveka (), who argued in his &quot;Prajñāpadīpa&quot; (Lamp of Wisdom) for the use of logical arguments using the &quot;pramana&quot; based epistemology of Indian logicians like Dignāga. In what would become a source of much future debate, Bhāvaviveka criticized Buddhapālita for not putting Madhyamaka arguments into proper &quot;autonomous syllogisms&quot; (&quot;svatantra&quot;). Bhāvaviveka argued that mādhyamika&#x27;s should always put forth syllogistic arguments to prove the truth of the Madhyamaka thesis. Instead of just criticizing other&#x27;s arguments, a tactic called &quot;vitaṇḍā&quot; (attacking) which was seen in bad form in Indian philosophical circles, Bhāvaviveka held that madhyamikas must positively prove their position using sources of knowledge (pramanas) agreeable to all parties. He argued that the position of a Madhyamaka was simply that phenomena are devoid of an inherent nature. This approach has been labeled the &quot;svātantrika&quot; style of Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.

Another influential commentator, Candrakīrti (c. 600–650), sought to defend Buddhapālita and critique Bhāvaviveka&#x27;s position (and Dignāga) that one &quot;must&quot; construct independent (&quot;svatantra&quot;) arguments to positively prove the Madhyamaka thesis, on the grounds this contains a subtle essentialist commitment. He argued that madhyamikas do not &quot;have&quot; to argue by &quot;svantantra&quot;, but can merely show the untenable consequences (&quot;prasaṅga&quot;) of all philosophical positions put forth by their adversary. Furthermore, for Candrakīrti, there is a problem with assuming that the madhyamika and the essentialist opponent can begin with the same shared premises that are required for this kind of syllogistic reasoning because the essentialist and the Madhyamaka do not share a basic understanding of what it means for things to exist in the first place.

Candrakīrti also criticized the Buddhist yogācāra school, which he saw as positing a form of subjective idealism due to their doctrine of &quot;appearance only&quot; (&quot;vijñaptimatra&quot;). Candrakīrti faults the Yogācāra school for not realizing that the nature of consciousness is also a conditioned phenomenon, and for privileging consciousness over its objects ontologically, instead of seeing that &quot;everything&quot; is empty. Candrakīrti wrote the &quot;Prasannapadā&quot; (Clear Words), a highly influential commentary on the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; as well as the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra,&quot; an introduction to Madhyamaka. His works are central to the understanding of Madhyamaka in Tibetan Buddhism.

A later &quot;svātantrika&quot; figure is Avalokitavrata (seventh century), who composed a &quot;tika&quot; (sub-commentary) on Bhāvaviveka&#x27;s &quot;Prajñāpadīpa&quot; and who mentions important figures of the era such as Dharmakirti and Candrakīrti.

Another commentator on Nagarjuna is Bhikshu Vaśitva (&quot;Zizai&quot;) who composed a commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisaṃbhāra&quot; that survives in a translation by Dharmagupta in the Chinese canon.

Śāntideva (end 7th century – first half 8th century) is well known for his philosophical poem discussing the bodhisattva path and the six paramitas, the &quot;Bodhicaryāvatāra&quot;. He united &quot;a deep religiousness and joy of exposure together with the unquestioned Madhyamaka orthodoxy&quot;. Later in the 10th century, there were commentators on the works of prasangika authors such as Prajñakaramati who wrote a commentary on the &quot;Bodhicaryāvatāra&quot; and Jayananda who commented on Candrakīrti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra.&quot;

A lesser known treatise on the six paramitas associated with the Madhyamaka school is Ārya Śūra&#x27;s &quot;Pāramitāsamāsa,&quot; unlikely to be the same author as that of the &quot;Garland of Jatakas.&quot;

Other lesser known madhyamikas include Devasarman (fifth to sixth centuries) and Gunamati (the fifth to sixth centuries) both of whom wrote commentaries on the MMK that exist only in Tibetan fragments.

=== Yogācāra-Madhyamaka ===

According to Ruegg, possibly the earliest figure to work with the two schools was Vimuktisena (early sixth century), a commentator on the &quot;Abhisamayalamkara&quot; and also is reported to have been a pupil of Bhāvaviveka as well as Vasubandhu.

The seventh and eighth centuries saw a synthesis of the Buddhist yogācāra tradition with Madhyamaka, beginning with the work of Śrigupta, Jñānagarbha (Śrigupta&#x27;s disciple) and his student Śāntarakṣita (8th-century) who, like Bhāvaviveka, also adopted some of the terminology of the Buddhist pramana tradition, in their time best represented by Dharmakīrti.

Like the classical Madhyamaka, Yogācāra-Madhyamaka approaches ultimate truth through the prasaṅga method of showing absurd consequences. However, when speaking of conventional reality they also make positive assertions and autonomous arguments like Bhāvaviveka and Dharmakīrti. Śāntarakṣita also subsumed the Yogācāra system into his presentation of the conventional, accepting their idealism on a conventional level as a preparation for the ultimate truth of Madhyamaka.

In his &quot;Madhyamakālaṃkāra&quot; (verses 92–93), Śāntarakṣita says:

By relying on the Mind Only (&quot;cittamatra&quot;), know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this [Madhyamaka] system, know that no self at all exists, even in that [mind]. Therefore, due to holding the reins of logic as one rides the chariots of the two systems, one attains [the path of] the actual Mahayanist.

Śāntarakṣita and his student Kamalaśīla (known for his text on self development and meditation, the &quot;Bhavanakrama&quot;) were influential in the initial spread of Madhyamaka Buddhism to Tibet. Haribhadra, another important figure of this school, wrote an influential commentary on the &quot;Abhisamayalamkara.&quot;

=== Vajrayana Madhyamaka ===

The Madhyamaka philosophy continued to be of major importance during the period of Indian Buddhism when the tantric Vajrayana Buddhism rose to prominence. One of the central Vajrayana Madhyamaka philosophers was Arya Nagarjuna (also known as the &quot;Tantric Nagarjuna&quot;, 7th–8th centuries) who may be the author of the &quot;Bodhicittavivarana&quot; as well as a notable commentator on the &quot;Guhyasamāja Tantra&quot;. Other figures in his lineage include Nagabodhi, Vajrabodhi, Aryadeva-pada and Candrakirti-pada.

Later figures include Bodhibhadra (), a Nalanda university master who wrote on philosophy and yoga and who was a teacher of Atiśa Dīpaṃkara Śrījñāna (982 – 1054 CE) who was an influential figure in the transmission of Buddhism to Tibet and wrote the influential &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot; (Lamp for the Path to Awakening).

==Tibetan Buddhism==
Madhyamaka philosophy obtained a central position in all the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, all whom consider themselves to be madhyamikas. Madhyamaka thought has been categorized in various ways in India and Tibet.

=== Early transmission ===
Influential early figures who are important in the transmission of Madhyamaka to Tibet include the Yogacara-Madhyamaka Śāntarakṣita (725–788), and his students Haribhadra and Kamalashila (740–795) as well as the later Kadampa figures of Atisha (982–1054) and his pupil Dromtön (1005–1064) who taught Madhyamaka by using the works of Bhāviveka and Candrakīrti.

The early transmission of Buddhism to Tibet saw these two main strands of philosophical views in debate with each other. The first was the camp which defended the Yogacara-Madhyamaka interpretation (and thus, svatantrika) centered on the works of the scholars of the Sangphu monastery founded by Ngog Loden Sherab (1059–1109) and also includes Chapa Chokyi Senge (1109–1169).

The second camp was those who championed the work of Candrakirti over the Yogacara-Madhyamaka interpretation, and included Sangphu monk Patsab Nyima Drag (b. 1055) and Jayananda (fl 12th century). According to John Dunne, it was the Madhyamaka interpretation and the works of Candrakirti which became dominant over time in Tibet.

Another very influential figure from this early period is Mabja Jangchub Tsöndrü (d. 1185), who wrote an important commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;. Mabja was a student of both the Dharmakirtian Chapa and the Candrakirti scholar Patsab and his work shows an attempt to steer a middle course between their views. Mabja affirms the conventional usefulness of Buddhist pramāṇa, but also accepts Candrakirti&#x27;s prasangika views. Mabja&#x27;s Madhyamaka scholarship was very influential on later Tibetan Madhyamikas such as Longchenpa, Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, and Mikyö Dorje.

==== Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika interpretations ====
In Tibetan Buddhist scholarship, a distinction began to be made between the Autonomist (&quot;Svātantrika, rang rgyud pa&quot;) and Consequentialist (&quot;Prāsaṅgika, Thal &#x27;gyur pa&quot;) approaches to Madhyamaka reasoning. The distinction was one invented by Tibetans, and not one made by classical Indian madhyamikas. Tibetans mainly use the terms to refer to the logical procedures used by Bhavaviveka (who argued for the use of &quot;svatantra-anumana&quot; or autonomous syllogisms) and Buddhapalita (who held that one should only use &quot;prasanga&quot;, or &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;). Tibetan Buddhism further divides &quot;svātantrika&quot; into sautrantika Svātantrika Madhyamaka (applied to Bhāviveka), and Yogācāra Svātantrika Madhyamaka (śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla).

The Svātantrika states that conventional phenomena are understood to have a conventional essential existence, but without an ultimately existing essence. In this way they believe they are able to make positive or &quot;autonomous&quot; assertions using syllogistic logic because they are able to share a subject that is established as appearing in common – the proponent and opponent use the same kind of valid cognition to establish it. The name comes from this quality of being able to use autonomous arguments in debate.

In contrast, the central technique avowed by the  is to show by &quot;&quot; (or reductio ad absurdum) that any positive assertion (such as &quot;asti&quot; or &quot;nāsti&quot;, &quot;it is&quot;, or &quot;it is not&quot;) or view regarding phenomena must be regarded as merely conventional ( or &quot;lokavyavahāra&quot;). The &quot;prāsaṅgika&quot; holds that it is not necessary for the proponent and opponent to use the same kind of valid cognition (&quot;pramana&quot;) to establish a common subject; indeed it is possible to change the view of an opponent through a reductio argument.

Although presented as a divide in doctrine, the major difference between Svātantrika and Prasangika may be between two style of reasoning and arguing, while the division itself is exclusively Tibetan. Tibetan scholars were aware of alternative Madhyamaka sub-classifications, but later Tibetan doxography emphasizes the nomenclature of prāsaṅgika versus svātantrika. No conclusive evidence can show the existence of an Indian antecedent, and it is not certain to what degree individual writers in Indian and Tibetan discussion held each of these views and if they held a view generally or only in particular instances. Both Prāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas cited material in the āgamas in support of their arguments.

Longchen Rabjam noted in the 14th century that Candrakirti favored the approach when specifically discussing the analysis for ultimacy, but otherwise he made positive assertions such as when describing the paths of Buddhist practice in his &quot;Madhyamakavatāra&quot;. Therefore, even make positive assertions when discussing conventional practice, they simply stick to using reductios specifically when analyzing for ultimate truth.

=== Jonang and &quot;Other Emptiness&quot; ===
Further Tibetan philosophical developments began in response to the works of the scholar Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen (1292–1361) and led to two distinctly opposed Tibetan Madhyamaka views on the nature of ultimate reality. An important Tibetan treatise on Emptiness and Buddha Nature is found in Dolpopa&#x27;s voluminous study, &quot;Mountain Doctrine&quot;.

Dolpopa, the founder of the Jonang school, viewed the Buddha and Buddha Nature as &quot;not&quot; intrinsically empty, but as truly real, unconditioned, and replete with eternal, changeless virtues. In the Jonang school, ultimate reality, i.e. Buddha Nature (&quot;tathagatagarbha&quot;) is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned (conventional reality), not of its own self which is ultimate Buddhahood and the luminous nature of mind. In Jonang, this ultimate reality is a &quot;ground or substratum&quot; which is &quot;uncreated and indestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination&quot;.

Basing himself on the Indian Tathāgatagarbha sūtras as his main sources, Dolpopa described the Buddha Nature as: [N]on-material emptiness, emptiness that is far from an annihilatory emptiness, great emptiness that is the ultimate pristine wisdom of superiors ...Buddha earlier than all Buddhas, ... causeless original Buddha.

This &quot;great emptiness&quot; i.e. the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is said to be filled with eternal powers and virtues:

The Jonang position came to be known as &quot;emptiness of other&quot; (&quot;)&quot;&quot;,&quot; because it held that the ultimate truth was positive reality that was not empty of its own nature, only empty of what it was other than itself. Dolpopa considered his view a form of Madhyamaka, and called his system &quot;Great Madhyamaka&quot;. Dolpopa opposed what he called &quot;rangtong&quot; (self-empty), the view that ultimate reality is that which is empty of self nature in a relative and absolute sense, that is to say that it is empty of everything, including itself. It is thus not a transcendental ground or metaphysical absolute which includes all the eternal Buddha qualities. This &quot;rangtong – shentong&quot; distinction became a central issue of contention among Tibetan Buddhist philosophers.

Alternative interpretations of the shentong view is also taught outside of Jonang. Some Kagyu figures, like Jamgon Kongtrul (1813–1899) as well as the unorthodox Sakya philosopher Shakya Chokden (1428–1507), supported their own forms of shentong.

=== Tsongkhapa and Gelug &quot;Prāsaṅgika&quot; ===

The Gelug school was founded in the beginning of the 15th century by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419). Tsongkhapa&#x27;s conception of emptiness draws mainly from the works of &quot;prāsaṅgika&quot; Indian thinkers like Buddhapalita, Candrakirti, and Shantideva and he argued that only their interpretation of Nagarjuna was ultimately correct. According to José I. Cabezón, Tsongkhapa also argued that the ultimate truth or emptiness was &quot;an absolute negation (&quot;med dgag&quot;)—the negation of inherent existence—and that nothing was exempt from being empty, including emptiness itself.&quot;

Tsongkhapa also maintained that the ultimate truth could be understood conceptually, an understanding which could later be transformed into a non-conceptual one. This conceptual understanding could only be done through the use of madhyamika reasoning, which he also sought to unify with the logical theories of Dharmakirti. Because of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view of emptiness as an absolute negation, he strongly attacked the other empty views of Dolpopa in his works. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s major work on Madhyamaka is his commentary on the MMK called &quot;Ocean of Reasoning&quot;.

According to Thupten Jinpa, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s &quot;doctrine of the object of negation&quot; is one of his most innovative but also controversial ideas. Tsongkhapa pointed out that if one wants to steer a middle course between the extremes of &quot;over-negation&quot; (straying into nihilism) and &quot;under-negation&quot; (and thus reification), it is important to have a clear concept of exactly what is being negated in Madhyamaka analysis (termed &quot;the object of negation&quot;).

According to Jay Garfield and Sonam Thakchoe, for Tsongkhapa, there are two aspects of the object of negation: &quot;erroneous apprehension&quot; ( &quot;phyin ci log gi ‘dzin pa&quot;) and &quot;the existence of intrinsic nature thereby apprehended&quot; (&quot;des bzung ba’i rang bzhin yod pa&quot;). The second aspect is an erroneously reified fiction which does not exist even conventionally. This is the fundamental object of negation for Tsongkhapa &quot;since the reified object must first be negated in order to eliminate the erroneous subjective state&quot;.

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s understanding of the object of negation (Tib. &quot;dgag bya&quot;) is subtle, and he describes one aspect of it as an &quot;innate apprehension of self-existence&quot;. Thupten Jinpa glosses this as a belief that we have that leads us to &quot;perceive things and events as possessing some kind of intrinsic existence and identity&quot;. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s Madhyamaka therefore, does not deny the conventional existence of things &quot;per se&quot;, but merely rejects our way of experiencing things as existing in an essentialist way, which are false projections or imputations. This is the root of ignorance, which for Tsongkhapa is an &quot;active defiling agency&quot; (Sk. &quot;kleśāvaraṇa&quot;) which projects a false sense of reality onto objects.

As Garfield and Thakchoe note, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view allows him to &quot;preserve a robust sense of the reality of the conventional world in the context of emptiness and to provide an analysis of the relation between emptiness and conventional reality that makes clear sense of the identity of the two truths&quot;. Because conventional existence (or &#x27;mere appearance&#x27;) as an interdependent phenomenon devoid of inherent existence is not negated (khegs pa) or &quot;rationally undermined&quot; in his analysis, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s approach was criticized by other Tibetan madhyamikas who preferred an anti-realist interpretation of Madhyamaka.

Following Candrakirti, Tsongkhapa also rejected the Yogacara view of mind only, and instead defended the conventional existence of external objects even though ultimately they are mere &quot;thought constructions&quot; (Tib. &quot;rtog pas btags tsam&quot;) of a deluded mind. Tsongkhapa also followed Candrakirti in rejecting &quot;svātantra&quot; (&quot;autonomous&quot;) reasoning, arguing that it was enough to show the unwelcome consequences (&quot;prasaṅga&quot;) of essentialist positions.

Gelug scholarship has generally maintained and defended Tsongkhapa&#x27;s positions up until the present day, even if there are lively debates considering issues of interpretation. Jamyang Sheba, Changkya Rölpé Dorjé, Gendun Chopel and the 14th Dalai Lama are some of the most influential modern figures in Gelug Madhyamaka.

=== Sakya Madhyamaka ===
The Sakya school has generally held a classic prāsaṅgika position following Candrakirti closely, though with significant differences from the Gelug. Sakya scholars of Madhyamaka, such as Rendawa Zhönnu Lodrö (1349–1412) and Rongtön Sheyja Künrig (1367–1450) were early critics of the &quot;other empty&quot; view (Shentong).

Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429–1489) was an important Sakya philosopher which defended the orthodox Sakya Madhyamaka position, critiquing both Dolpopa and Tsongkhapa&#x27;s interpretations. He is widely studied, not only in Sakya, but also in Nyingma and Kagyü institutions.

According to Cabezón, Gorampa called his version of Madhyamaka &quot;the middle way &quot;qua&quot; free from extremes&quot; (&quot;mtha&#x27; bral dbu ma&quot;) or &quot;middle way &quot;qua&quot; free from proliferations&quot; (&quot;spros bral kyi dbu ma&quot;), and claimed that the ultimate truth was ineffable, beyond predication or concept. Cabezón states that Gorampa&#x27;s interpretation of Madhyamaka is &quot;committed to a more literal reading of the Indian sources than either Dolpopa&#x27;s or Tsongkhapa&#x27;s, which is to say that it tends to take the Indian texts at face value.&quot; For Gorampa, emptiness is not just the absence of inherent existence, but it is the absence of the four extremes in all phenomena, i.e. existence, nonexistence, both and neither (see: &quot;catuskoti&quot;), &quot;without any further qualification&quot;.

In other words, conventional truths are also an object of negation, because as Gorampa states &quot;they are not found at all (to be ultimately existent) when subjected to ultimate rational analysis&quot;. Hence, Gorampa&#x27;s Madhyamaka negates &quot;existence&quot; &quot;itself&quot; or existence without qualifications, while for Tsongkhapa, the object of negation is &quot;inherent existence&quot;, &quot;intrinsic existence&quot; or &quot;intrinsic nature&quot;.

In his &quot;Elimination of Erroneous Views&quot; (&quot;lta ba ngan bsal&quot;), Gorampa argues that Madhyamaka ultimately negates &quot;all false appearances&quot;, which means anything that appears to our mind (i.e. all conventional phenomena). Since all appearances are conceptually produced illusions, they must cease when conceptual reification is brought to an end by insight. This is the &quot;ultimate freedom from conceptual fabrication&quot; (&quot;don dam spros bral&quot;). To reach this, Madhyamikas must negate &quot;the reality of appearances&quot;. In other words, all conventional realities are fabrications and since awakening requires transcending all fabrication (&quot;spros bral&quot;), conventional reality must be negated. Thus, for Gorampa, all conventional knowledge is dualistic, being based on a false distinction between subject and object. Therefore, for Gorampa, Madhyamaka analyzes all supposedly real phenomena and concludes through that analysis &quot;that those things do not exist and so that so-called conventional reality is entirely nonexistent&quot;.

Regarding the Ultimate truth, Gorampa saw this as being divided into two parts: 

* The emptiness that is reached by rational analysis (this is actually only an &quot;analogue&quot;, and not the real thing). 
* The emptiness that yogis fathom by means of their own individual gnosis (&quot;prajña&quot;). This is the real ultimate truth, which is reached by negating the previous rational understanding of emptiness.

Unlike most orthodox Sakyas, the philosopher Shakya Chokden, a contemporary of Gorampa, also promoted a form of Shentong as being complementary to Rangtong. He saw Shentong as useful for meditative practice, while Rangtong as useful for cutting through views.

=== Comparison of the views of Tsongkhapa and Gorampa ===
As Garfield and Thakchoe note, for Tsongkhapa, conventional truth is &quot;a kind of truth&quot;, &quot;a way of being real&quot; and &quot;a kind of existence&quot; while for Gorampa, the conventional is &quot;entirely false&quot;, &quot;unreal&quot;, &quot;a kind of nonexistence&quot; and &quot;truth only from the perspective of fools&quot;.

Jay L. Garfield and Sonam Thakchoe outline the different competing models of Gorampa and Tsongkhapa as follows:

[Gorampa&#x27;s]: The object of negation is the conventional phenomenon itself. Let us see how that plays out in an account of the status of conventional truth. Since ultimate truth—emptiness—is an external negation, and since an external negation eliminates its object while leaving nothing behind, when we say that a person is empty, we eliminate the &quot;person&quot;, leaving nothing else behind. To be sure, we must, as mādhyamikas, in agreement with ordinary persons, admit that the person exists &quot;conventionally&quot; despite not existing &quot;ultimately&quot;. But, if emptiness eliminates the person, that conventional existence is a complete illusion: The ultimate emptiness of the person shows that the person simply does not exist. It is no more actual than Santa Claus, the protestations of ordinary people and small children to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Tsongkhapa&#x27;s]: The object of negation is not the conventional phenomenon itself but instead the intrinsic nature or intrinsic existence of the conventional phenomenon. The consequences of taking the object of negation this way are very different. On this account, when we say that the person does not exist ultimately, what is eliminated by its ultimate emptiness is its intrinsic existence. No other intrinsic identity is projected in the place of that which was undermined by emptiness, even emptiness or conventional reality. But the person is not thereby eliminated. Its conventional existence is therefore, on this account, simply its existence devoid of intrinsic identity as an interdependent phenomenon. On this view, conventional reality is no illusion; it is the actual mode of existence of actual things.

According to Garfield and Thakchoe each of these &quot;radically distinct views&quot; on the nature of the two truths &quot;has scriptural support, and indeed each view can be supported by citations from different passages of the same text or even slightly different contextual interpretations of the same passage&quot;.

=== Kagyu ===

In the Kagyu tradition, there is a broad field of opinion on the nature of emptiness, with some holding the &quot;other empty&quot; (&quot;shentong&quot;) view while others holding different positions. One influential Kagyu thinker was Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama. His view synthesized Madhyamaka and Yogacara perspectives. According to Karl Brunnholzl, regarding his position in the rangtong-shentong debate he &quot;can be said to regard these two as not being mutually exclusive and to combine them in a creative synthesis&quot;. However, Rangjung Dorje never uses these terms in any of his works and thus any claims to him being a promoter of shentong or otherwise is a later interpretation.

Several Kagyu figures disagree with the view that shentong is a form of madhyamaka. According to Brunnholzl, Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama (1507–1554) and Second Pawo Rinpoche Tsugla Trengwa see the term &quot;shentong madhyamaka&quot; as a misnomer, for them the Yogacara of Asanga and Vasubandhu and the system of Nagarjuna are &quot;two clearly distinguished systems&quot;. They also refute the idea that there is &quot;a permanent, intrinsically existing Buddha nature&quot;.

Mikyö Dorje also argues that the language of other emptiness does not appear in any of the sutras or the treatises of the Indian masters. He attacks the view of Dolpopa as being against the sutras of ultimate meaning which state that all phenomena are emptiness as well as being against the treatises of the Indian masters. Mikyö Dorje rejects both perspectives of rangtong and shentong as true descriptions of ultimate reality, which he sees as being &quot;the utter peace of all discursiveness regarding being empty and not being empty&quot;.

One of the most influential Kagyu philosophers in recent times was Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye (1813–1899) who advocated a system of shentong madhyamaka and held that primordial wisdom was &quot;never empty of its own nature and it is there all the time&quot;.

The modern Kagyu teacher Khenpo Tsultrim (1934–), in his &quot;Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness&quot;, presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five tenet systems. He holds the &quot;Shentong Madhyamaka&quot; as the highest view, above prasangika. He sees this as a meditation on &quot;Paramarthasatya&quot; (&quot;Absolute Reality&quot;), &quot;Buddhajnana&quot;, which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as &quot;truly existing&quot;. This approach helps &quot;to overcome certain residual subtle concepts&quot;, and &quot;the habit – fostered on the earlier stages of the path – of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind.&quot; It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner &quot;to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated.&quot;

=== Nyingma Madhyamaka ===
In the Nyingma school, like in Kagyu, there is a variety of views. Some Nyingma thinkers promoted &quot;shentong&quot;, like Katok Tsewang Norbu, but the most influential Nyingma thinkers like Longchenpa and Ju Mipham held a more classical prāsaṅgika interpretation while at the same time seeking to harmonize it with the dzogchen view found in the dzgochen tantras which are traditionally seen as the pinnacle of the Nyingma view.

According to Sonam Thakchoe, the ultimate truth in the Nyingma tradition, following Longchenpa, is that &quot;reality which transcends any mode of thinking and speech, one that unmistakenly appears to the nonerroneous cognitive processes of the exalted and awakened beings&quot; and this is said to be &quot;inexpressible beyond words and thoughts&quot; as well as the reality that is the &quot;transcendence of all elaborations.

The most influential modern Nyingma scholar is Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso (1846–1912). He developed a unique theory of madhyamaka, with two models of the two truths. While he adopts the traditional madhyamaka model of two truths, in which the ultimate truth is emptiness, he also developed a second model, in which the ultimate truth is &quot;reality as it is&quot; (&quot;de bzhin nyid&quot;) which is &quot;established as ultimately real&quot; (&quot;bden par grub pa&quot;).

This ultimate truth is associated with the Dzogchen concept of Rigpa. While it might seem that this system conflicts with the traditional madhyamaka interpretation, for Mipham this is not so. For while the traditional model which sees emptiness and ultimate truth as a negation is referring to the analysis of experience, the second Dzogchen influenced model refers to the experience of unity in meditation. Douglas Duckworth sees Mipham&#x27;s work as an attempt to bring together the two main Mahayana philosophical systems of Yogacara and Madhyamaka, as well as shentong and rangtong into a coherent system in which both are seen as being of definitive meaning.

Regarding the &quot;svatantrika prasangika&quot; debate, Ju Mipham explained that using positive assertions in logical debate may serve a useful purpose, either while debating with non-Buddhist schools or to move a student from a coarser to a more subtle view. Similarly, discussing an approximate ultimate helps students who have difficulty using only &quot;&quot; methods move closer to the understanding of the true ultimate. Ju Mipham felt that the ultimate non-enumerated truth of the svatantrika was no different from the ultimate truth of the Prāsaṅgika. He felt the only difference between them was with respect to how they discussed conventional truth and their approach to presenting a path.

== East Asian madhyamaka ==
=== Sānlùn school ===
Chinese madhyamaka (known as &quot;sānlùn,&quot; or the three treatise school) began with the work of Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) who translated the works of Nāgārjuna (including the MMK, also known in China as the &quot;Chung lun&quot;, &quot;Madhyamakaśāstra&quot;; Taishō 1564) to Chinese. Another influential text in Chinese madhyamaka which was said to have been translated by Kumārajīva was the &quot;Ta-chih-tu lun&quot;, or *&quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa Śāstra&quot; (&quot;Treatise which is a Teaching on the Great Perfection of Wisdom [Sūtra]&quot;). According to Dan Arnold, this text is only extant in Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation and has material that differs from the work of Nāgārjuna. In spite of this, the &quot;Ta-chih-tu lun&quot; became a central text for Chinese interpretations of madhyamaka emptiness.

&quot;Sānlùn&quot; figures like Kumārajīva&#x27;s pupil Sengzhao (384–414), and the later Jizang (549–623) were influential in restoring a more orthodox and non-essentialist interpretation of emptiness to Chinese Buddhism. Yin Shun (1906–2005) is one modern figure aligned with &quot;Sānlùn.&quot;

Sengzhao is often seen as the founder of &quot;Sānlùn.&quot; He was influenced not just by Indian madhyamaka and Mahayana sutras like the Vimalakirti, but also by Taoist works and he widely quotes the Lao-tzu and the Chuang-tzu and uses terminology of the Neo-Daoist &quot;Mystery Learning&quot; (&quot;xuanxue&quot; 玄学) tradition while maintaining a uniquely Buddhist philosophical view. In his essay &quot;The Emptiness of the Non-Absolute&quot; (&quot;buzhenkong&quot;, 不眞空), Sengzhao points out that the nature of phenomena cannot be taken as being either existent or inexistent:

Hence, there are indeed reasons why myriad dharmas are inexistent and cannot be taken as existent; there are reasons why [myriad dharmas] are not inexistent and cannot be taken as inexistent. Why? If we would say that they exist, their existent is not real; if we would say that they don&#x27;t exist, their phenomenal forms have taken shape. Having forms and shapes, they are not inexistent. Being not real, they are not truly existent. Hence the meaning of bu zhen kong [not really empty, 不眞空] is made manifest.

Sengzhao saw the central problem in understanding emptiness as the discriminatory activity of &quot;prapañca.&quot; According to Sengzhao, delusion arises through a dependent relationship between phenomenal things, naming, thought and reification and correct understanding lies outside of words and concepts. Thus, while emptiness is the lack of intrinsic self in all things, this emptiness is not itself an absolute and cannot be grasped by the conceptual mind, it can be only be realized through non-conceptual wisdom (&quot;prajña&quot;).

Jizang (549–623) was another central figure in Chinese madhyamaka who wrote numerous commentaries on Nagarjuna and Aryadeva and is considered to be the leading representative of the school. Jizang called his method &quot;deconstructing what is misleading and revealing what is corrective&quot;. He insisted that one must never settle on any particular viewpoint or perspective but constantly reexamine one&#x27;s formulations to avoid reifications of thought and behavior. In his commentary on the MMK, Jizang&#x27;s method and understanding of emptiness can be seen:

The abhidharma thinkers regard the four holy truths as true. The Satyasiddhi regards merely the truth of cessation of suffering, i.e., the principle of emptiness and equality, as true. The southern Mahāyāna tradition regards the principle that refutes truths as true, and the northern [Mahāyāna tradition] regards thatness [suchness] and prajñā as true... Examining these all together, if there is a single [true] principle, it is an eternal view, which is false. If there is no principle at all, it is an evil view, which is also false. Being both existent and non-existent consists of the eternal and nihilistic views altogether. Being neither existent nor nonexistent is a foolish view. One replete with these four phrases has all [wrong] views. One without these four phrases has a severe nihilistic view. Now that [one] does not know how to name what a mind has nothing to rely upon and is free from conceptual construction, [he] foists &quot;thatness&quot; [suchness] upon it, one attains sainthood of the three vehicles... Being deluded in regard to thatness [suchness], one falls into the six realms of disturbed life and death.

In one of his early treatises called &quot;The Meaning of the two Truths&quot; (&quot;Erdiyi&quot;), Jizang, expounds the steps to realize the nature of the ultimate truth of emptiness as follows:

In the first step, one recognises reality of the phenomena on the conventional level, but assumes their non-reality on the ultimate level. In the second step, one becomes aware of Being or Non-Being on the conventional level and negates both at the ultimate level. In the third step, one either asserts or negates Being and Non-Being on the conventional level, neither confi rming nor rejecting them on the ultimate level. Hence, there is ultimately no assertion or negation anymore; therefore, on the conventional level, one becomes free to accept or reject anything.

In the modern era, there has been a revival of mādhyamaka in Chinese Buddhism. A major figure in this revival is the scholar monk Yin Shun (1906–2005). Yin Shun emphasized the study of Indian Buddhist sources as primary and his books on mādhyamaka had a profound influence on modern Chinese madhyamika scholarship. He argued that the works of Nagarjuna were &quot;the inheritance of the conceptualisation of dependent arising as proposed in the Agamas&quot; and he thus based his mādhyamaka interpretations on the Agamas rather than on Chinese scriptures and commentaries. He saw the writings of Nagarjuna as the correct Buddhadharma while considering the writings of the Sānlùn school as being corrupted due to their synthesizing of the Tathagata-garbha doctrine into madhyamaka.

Many modern Chinese mādhyamaka scholars such as Li Zhifu, Yang Huinan and Lan Jifu have been students of Yin Shun.

=== Chán ===
The Chán/Zen-tradition emulated madhyamaka-thought via the San-lun Buddhists, influencing its supposedly &quot;illogical&quot; way of communicating &quot;absolute truth&quot;. The madhyamika of Sengzhao for example, influenced the views of the Chan patriarch Shen Hui (670–762), a critical figure in the development of Chan, as can be seen by his &quot;Illuminating the Essential Doctrine&quot; (&quot;Hsie Tsung Chi&quot;). This text emphasizes that true emptiness or Suchness cannot be known through thought since it is free from thought (&quot;wu-nien&quot;):

Thus we come to realize that both selves and things are, in their essence, empty, and existence and non-existence both disappear.

Mind is fundamentally non-action; the way is truly no-thought (&quot;wu-nien&quot;).

There is no thought, no reflection, no seeking, no attainment, no this, no that, no coming, no going.

Shen Hui also states that true emptiness is not nothing, but it is a &quot;Subtle Existence&quot; (&quot;miao-yu&quot;), which is just &quot;Great Prajña.&quot;

==Western Buddhism==

===Thich Nhat Hanh===

Thich Nhat Hanh explains the madhyamaka concept of emptiness through the Chinese Buddhist concept of interdependence. In this analogy, there is no first or ultimate cause for anything that occurs. Instead, all things are dependent on innumerable causes and conditions that are themselves dependent on innumerable causes and conditions. The interdependence of all phenomena, including the self, is a helpful way to undermine mistaken views about inherence, or that one&#x27;s self is inherently existent. It is also a helpful way to discuss Mahayana teachings on motivation, compassion, and ethics. The comparison to interdependence has produced recent discussion comparing Mahayana ethics to environmental ethics.

===Modern Madhyamaka===

Madhyamaka forms an alternative to the perennialist and essentialist understanding of nondualism and modern spiritual metaphysics (influenced by idealistic monism views like Neo-Advaita).

In some modern works, classical madhyamaka teachings are sometimes complemented with postmodern philosophy, critical sociology, and social constructionism. These approaches stress that there is no transcendental reality beyond this phenomenal world, and in some cases even explicitly distinguish themselves from neo-Advaita approaches.

== Influences and critiques ==

=== Yogacara ===
The Yogacara school was the other major Mahayana philosophical school (darsana) in India and its complex relationship with madhyamaka changed over time. The &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana sūtra&quot;, perhaps the earliest Yogacara text, proclaims itself as being above the doctrine of emptiness taught in other sutras. According to Paul Williams, the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot; claims that other sutras that teach emptiness as well as madhyamika teachings on emptiness are merely skillful means and thus are not definitive (unlike the final teachings in the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana&quot;).

As Mark Siderits points out, Yogacara authors like Asanga were careful to point out that the doctrine of emptiness required interpretation in lieu of their three natures theory which posits an inexpressible ultimate that is the object of a Buddha&#x27;s cognition. Asanga also argued that one cannot say that all things are empty unless there &quot;are&quot; things to be seen as either empty or non-empty in the first place. 

In the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;&#x27;s Tattvartha chapter, Asanga attacks the view which states &quot;the truth is that all is just conceptual fictions&quot; by stating:

As for their view, due to the absence of the thing itself which serves as basis of the concept, conceptual fictions must all likewise absolutely not exist. How then will it be true that all is just conceptual fictions? Through this conception on their part, reality, conceptual fiction, and the two together are all denied. Because they deny both conceptual fiction and reality, they should be considered the nihilist-in-chief. 

Asanga also critiqued madhyamaka because he held that it could lead to a laxity in the following of ethical precepts as well as for being &quot;imaginatively constructed views that are arrived at only through reasoning&quot;. He further states:

How, again, is emptiness wrongly conceptualized? Some ascetics and Brahmins do not acknowledge that [viz. intrinsic nature] of which something is empty. Nor do they acknowledge that which is empty [viz. things and dharmas]. It is in this way that emptiness is said to be wrongly conceived. For what reason? Because that of which it is empty is non-existent, but that which is empty is existent— it is thus that emptiness is possible. What will be empty of what, where, when everything is unreal? This thing&#x27;s being devoid of that is not [then] possible. Thus emptiness is wrongly conceptualized in this case.

Asanga also wrote that:if nothing is real, there cannot be any ideas (&quot;prajñapti&quot;). Someone who holds this view is a nihilist, with whom one should not speak or share living quarters. This person falls into a bad rebirth and takes others with him. Vasubandhu also states that emptiness does not mean that things have no intrinsic nature, but that this nature is &quot;inexpressible and only to be apprehended by a kind of cognition that transcends the subject-object duality&quot;.

Thus early yogacarins were engaged in a project to reinterpret the radical madhyamaka view of emptiness. Later yogacarins like Sthiramati and Dharmapala debated with their madhyamika contemporaries. According to Xuanzang, Bhavaviveka, who critiques Yogacara views in his &quot;Madhyamakahṛdayakārikāḥ&quot;, was disturbed by the views of yogacarins and their critiques of madhyamaka as nihilism, and himself traveled to Nalanda to debate Dharmapala face to face, but Dharmapala refused. Bhavaviveka quotes the attacks from the yogacarins in his texts as claiming that while the Yogacara approach to prajñaparamita is the &quot;means to attain omniscience&quot;, the madhyamaka approach which &quot;concentrates on the negation of arising and cessation&quot; is not. Bhavaviveka responds to various Yogacara attacks and views in his &quot;Tarkajvālā&quot; (Blaze of reason) including the view that there are no external objects (idealism), the view that there is no use for logical argumentation (&quot;tarka&quot;), and the view that the dependent nature (&quot;paratantra-svabhāva&quot;) exists in an absolute sense.

However, Yogacara authors also commented on madhyamaka texts. As noted by Garfield, &quot;Asaṅga, Sthiramati, and Guṇamati composed commentaries on the foundational text of madhyamaka, Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;.&quot; An MMK commentary by the Indian Yogacara philosopher Sthiramati also survives in Chinese translation, the &quot;Commentary on the Mahāyāna Madhyamaka&quot; (&quot;Dasheng zhongguan shilun&quot; 大乘中觀釋論) which comments on the text from a Yogacara point of view. Dharmapala also composed a commentary on the &quot;Four-Hundred Verses&quot; (&quot;Catuḥśataka&quot;) of Āryadeva, the &quot;Commentary on the Four-Hundred Verses&quot; (&quot;Dasheng guang bailun shilun&quot; 大乘廣百論 釋論; T1571, in 10 fascicles). This shows that Yogacara authors did not necessarily see their project as a rejection of Nagarjuna&#x27;s Madhyamaka, but as an expansion of its insights. 

=== Advaita Vedanta ===
Several modern scholars have argued that the early Advaita Vedanta thinker Gaudapada (), was influenced by madhyamaka thought. They note that he borrowed the concept of &quot;&quot;ajāta&quot; (un-born) from madhyamaka philosophy, which also uses the term &quot;anutpāda&quot;&quot; (non-arising, un-originated, non-production). The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term &quot;anutpāda&quot; for the absence of an origin or shunyata. &quot;Ajātivāda&quot; is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada. According to Gaudapada, the Absolute (Brahman) is not subject to birth, change and death. Echoing Nagarjuna&#x27;s use of the catuskoti, Gaudapada writes that &quot;nothing whatsoever is originated either from itself or from something else; nothing whatsoever existent, non-existent, or both existent and non-existent is originated&quot;.

However, it has been noted that Gaudapada&#x27;s ultimate philosophical perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna&#x27;s since Gaudapada posits a metaphysical Absolute (which is &quot;aja&quot;, the unborn, and eternal) based on the &quot;Mandukya Upanishad&quot; and thus he remains primarily a Vedantin. The empirical world of appearances is considered unreal, and not absolutely existent. In this sense, Gaudapada also shares a doctrine of two truths or two levels of reality with madhyamaka. According to Gaudapada, this absolute, Brahman, cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, then the world has to be an unreal appearance of Brahman. From the level of ultimate truth (&quot;paramārthatā&quot;) the phenomenal world is &quot;Maya&quot; (illusion).

Richard King notes that the fourth prakarana of the &quot;Gaudapadiyakarika&quot; promotes several Mahayana Buddhist ideas, such as a middle way free from extremes, not being attached to dharmas and it even references beings called &quot;Buddhas&quot;. King notes that this could be an attempt to either reach a rapprochement with Buddhists or to woo Buddhists over to Vedanta. However, King adds that &quot;from a Madhyamaka perspective, the &quot;Gaudapadiyakarika&quot;&#x27;s acceptance of an unchanging Absolute supporting the world of appearances is a mistaken form of eternalism, despite Gaudapadian protestations to the contrary.&quot;

Shankara (early 8th century), a later Advaitin, directly dismissed madhyamaka as irrational and nihilistic, stating that it was a kind of nihilism that held that &quot;absolutely nothing exists&quot; and that this view:

 is contradicted by all means of right knowledge and requires no special refutation. For this apparent world, whose existence is guaranteed by all means of knowledge, cannot be denied, unless some one should find out some new truth (based on which he could impugn its existence) – for a general principle is proved by the absence of contrary instances.

This critique was upheld by most post Shankara Advaitins. However this did not prevent later Vedanta thinkers like Bhaskara of accusing Shankara of being a crypto-buddhist for his view that everyday reality is Maya (illusion) and that Brahman has no qualities and is undifferentiated. Another Vedantin philosopher, Ramanuja (1017–1137), directly compared Shankara&#x27;s &quot;mayavada&quot; views to madhyamaka, arguing that if Maya/Avidya is unreal, &quot;that would involve the acceptance of the Madhyamika doctrine, viz. of a general void&quot;. This critique by comparison is also echoed by the later philosophers like Madhva as well as Vijñanabhiksu (15th or 16th century), who goes as far as to call Shankara a nastika (unorthodox). Later Advaitins also acknowledged the similarity of their doctrine with madhyamaka. Vimuktatma states that if by &quot;asat&quot; (nonbeing), the Madhyamaka means Maya and not mere negation, then he is close to Vedanta. Sadananda also states that if by Sunya, what is meant is the reality beyond the intellect, then the madhyamaka accepts Vedanta. Sri Harsha notes that the two schools are similar, but they differ in that Advaita holds consciousness to be pure, real and eternal, while madhyamaka denies this.

=== Jain philosophy ===
Modern scholars such as Jeffery Long have also noted that the influential Jain philosopher Kundakunda (2nd CE century CE or later) also adopted a theory of two truths, possibly under the influence of Nagarjuna. According to W. J. Johnson he also adopts other Buddhist terms like prajña under the influence of Nagarjuna, though he applies the term to knowledge of the Self (jiva), which is also the ultimate perspective (&quot;niścayanaya),&quot; which is distinguished from the worldly perspective (&quot;vyavahāranaya&quot;).

The Jain philosopher Haribhadra also mentions madhyamaka. In both the &quot;Yogabindu&quot; and the &quot;Yogadrstisamuccaya&quot;, Haribhadra singles out Nagarjuna&#x27;s claim that samsara and nirvana are not different for criticism, labeling the view a &quot;fantasy&quot;.

=== Taoism ===
It is well known that medieval Chinese Taoism was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. One particular school, the Chongxuan (重玄, &quot;Twofold Mystery&quot;) founded by Cheng Xuanying (fl.632–650), was particularly involved in borrowing and adapting madhyamaka concepts like emptiness, the two truths and the catuskoti into their Taoist philosophical system.

== Modern scholarship ==

As noted by Ruegg, Western scholarship has given a broad variety of interpretations of madhyamaka, including: &quot;nihilism, monism, irrationalism, misology, agnosticism, scepticism, criticism, dialectic, mysticism, acosmism, absolutism, relativism, nominalism, and linguistic analysis with therapeutic value&quot;. Jay L. Garfield likewise notes:
These interpretations &quot;reflect almost as much about the viewpoints of the scholars involved as do they reflect the content of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s concepts&quot;.

According to Andrew Tuck, the Western study of Nagarjuna&#x27;s madhyamaka can be divided into three phases:

#The Kantian phase, exemplified by Theodore Stcherbatsky&#x27;s &quot;The Conception of Buddhist Nirvāna&quot; (1927) who argued that Nagarjuna divides the world into appearance (samsara) and an absolute noumenal reality (nirvana). This is also seen in T. R. V. Murti&#x27;s 1955 &quot;The Central Philosophy of Buddhism&quot;.
#The analytic phase, exemplified by Richard Robinson&#x27;s 1957 article &quot;Some Logical Aspects of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s System&quot;, sought to explain madhyamaka using analytic philosophy&#x27;s logical apparatus.
#The post-Wittgensteinian phase, exemplified by Frederick Streng&#x27;s &quot;Emptiness&quot; and Chris Gudmunsen&#x27;s &quot;Wittgenstein and Buddhism&quot;, &quot;set out to stress similarities between Nāgārjuna and in particular the later Wittgenstein and his criticism of analytic philosophy.&quot;

The Sri Lankan philosopher David Kalupahana meanwhile saw madhyamaka as a response to certain essentialist philosophical tendencies which had arisen after the time of the Buddha and sees it as a restoration of the early Buddhist middle way pragmatist position. Among the critical voices, Richard P. Hayes (influenced by Richard Robinson&#x27;s view that Nagarjuna&#x27;s logic fails modern tests for validity) interprets the works of Nagarjuna as &quot;primitive&quot; and guilty &quot;errors in reasoning&quot; such as that of equivocation. Hayes states that Nagarjuna was relying on the different meanings of the word &quot;svabhava&quot; to make statements which were not logical and that his work relies on various &quot;fallacies and tricks&quot;. William Magee strongly disagrees with Hayes, referring to Tsonghkhapa&#x27;s interpretation of Nagarjuna to argue that Hayes misidentifies Nagarjuna&#x27;s understanding of the different meanings of the term &quot;svabhava.&quot;

Many recent western scholars (such as Garfield, Napper, Hopkins,) have tended to adopt a Gelug Prāsaṅgika influenced interpretation of madhyamaka. However, American philosopher Mark Siderits is one exception, who has attempted to defend the Svātantrika position as a coherent and rational interpretation of madhyamaka.

C.W. Huntington meanwhile has been particularly critical of the modern Western attempt to read Nagarjuna &quot;through the lens of modern symbolic logic&quot; and to see him as compatible with analytical philosophy&#x27;s logical system. He argues that in reading Nagarjuna, a thinker who he sees as &quot;profoundly distrustful of logic&quot;, in an overly logical manner, we &quot;prejudice our understanding of Nagarjuna&#x27;s insistence that he has no proposition (&quot;pratijña&quot;).&quot; He puts forth a more literary interpretation that focuses on the &quot;effect&quot; Nagarjuna was attempting to &quot;conjure&quot; on his readers (i.e. an experience of having no views) instead of asking how it works (or does not) in a logical manner. In response to this, Jay Garfield defends the logical reading of Nagarjuna through the use of Anglo-American analytical philosophy as well as arguing that &quot;Nagarjuna and Candrakirti deploy arguments, take themselves to do so, and even if they did not, we would be wise to do so in commenting on their texts&quot;.

On the other hand, Rafal Stepien critiques the approach of scholars such as Garfield who treat logic as a neutral and objective lens through which to understand Nāgārjuna. According to Stepien, for Nāgārjuna, logic is just as karmically driven and oriented as any other phenomenon. Thus, to treat logic as something universal and objective is to posit a metaphysical absolute, which is antithetical to Nāgārjuna&#x27;s thought.

Another recent interpreter, Jan Westerhoff, argues that madhyamaka is a kind of anti-foundationalism, &quot;which does not just deny the objective, intrinsic, and mind-independent existence of some class of objects, but rejects such existence for any kinds of objects that we could regard as the most fundamental building-blocks of the world&quot;.

<text>Clifford Odets (July 18, 1906 – August 14, 1963) was an American playwright, screenwriter, and actor. In the mid-1930s, he was widely seen as the potential successor to Nobel Prize–winning playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill, as O&#x27;Neill began to withdraw from Broadway&#x27;s commercial pressures and increasing critical backlash. From January 1935, Odets&#x27;s socially relevant dramas were extremely influential, particularly for the remainder of the Great Depression. His works inspired the next several generations of playwrights, including Arthur Miller, Paddy Chayefsky, Neil Simon, and David Mamet. After the production of his play &quot;Clash by Night&quot; in the 1941–42 season, Odets focused his energies primarily on film projects, remaining in Hollywood until mid-1948. He returned to New York for five and a half years, during which time he produced three more Broadway plays, only one of which was a success. His prominence was eventually eclipsed by Miller, Tennessee Williams, and, in the early- to mid-1950s, William Inge.

== Early life ==
Odets was born in Philadelphia to Louis J. Odets (born Leib Gorodetsky) and Pearl Geisinger, Russian- and Romanian-Jewish immigrants, and was raised in Philadelphia and the Bronx, New York. He dropped out of high school after two years to become an actor and a writer.

== Career ==

=== Theatre ===
Odets pursued acting with great passion and ingenuity. At the age of 19 he struck out on his own, billing himself as &quot;The Rover Reciter.&quot; Under this moniker he participated in talent contests and procured bookings as a radio elocutionist. He appeared in several plays with Harry Kemp&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Theatre on the Lower East Side. Odets was among America&#x27;s first real disc jockeys at about this time, at radio station WBNY and others in Manhattan, where he would play records and ad lib commentary. He also functioned as a drama critic, allowing him free entry to Broadway and downtown shows. In this capacity he saw the 1926 Broadway production of Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;Juno and the Paycock.&quot; O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s work proved to be a powerful influence on Odets.

In the early 1920s, Odets spent four summers as a dramatics counselor at Jewish camps in the Catskills and the Poconos. He toured extensively with stock companies, in particular Philadelphia&#x27;s popular Mae Desmond Company, playing a large variety of character roles at their theater in Chester, Pennsylvania. His first Broadway break came in 1929 when he was cast in two small roles and as understudy to the young Spencer Tracy in &quot;Conflict&quot; by Warren F. Lawrence. Odets landed his first job with the prestigious Theatre Guild in the fall of 1929 as an extra. He acted in small roles in a number of Theatre Guild productions between 1929 and 1931. It was at the Guild that he befriended the casting director Cheryl Crawford. Crawford suggested that Harold Clurman, then a play reader for the Guild, invite Odets to a meeting to discuss new theater concepts they were developing with Lee Strasberg. Though initially bewildered by the concept of acting as an art, Odets was nonetheless mesmerized by Clurman&#x27;s talks and became the last actor chosen for the Group Theatre&#x27;s first summer of rehearsals in June 1931 at Brookfield Center in Connecticut, thus becoming a founding member of the company.

The Group Theatre proved to be one of the most influential companies in the history of the American stage. It was the first to base its work on an acting technique new to the United States, devised by the Russian actor and director Constantin Stanislavski. It was further developed by Group Theatre director Lee Strasberg and became known as The Method or Method Acting.

From the start, Odets was relegated to small roles and understudying his Group colleagues. He understudied lead actor Luther Adler in the Group&#x27;s production of John Howard Lawson&#x27;s &quot;Success Story&quot; during the 1932–33 season. Much to Odets&#x27;s frustration, Adler never missed a performance, but he gained much knowledge of the playwriting craft by standing in the wings and listening to the play. Odets credited Lawson with giving him an understanding of the potential theatrical power of colloquial language. With time on his hands and at Clurman&#x27;s urging he began to try his own hand at writing plays.

Odets&#x27;s earliest plays were an autobiographical piece, &quot;910 Eden Street&quot;, and one about his hero, Beethoven, with the working title &quot;Victory&quot;. Clurman dismissed both as juvenilia but encouraged Odets to continue writing, while steering him toward familiar milieus. In late 1932, Odets began writing a play about a middle-class Jewish family in the Bronx, initially called &quot;I Got the Blues&quot;. He worked diligently on this play, sharing drafts of it with Clurman and promising parts to his fellow actors—often the same parts. While at Green Mansions, its 1933 summer rehearsal venue in Warrensburg, New York, the Group performed Act II of the play, soon to be retitled &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;, for other camp residents. The audience was enthusiastic but the Group&#x27;s leadership, Strasberg in particular, still opposed producing it.

Until his debut as a playwright, Odets continued to train as an actor with the Group at its various summer rehearsal headquarters in the Connecticut countryside and upstate New York. In addition to Brookfield Center and Green Mansions, these venues included Dover Furnace in Dutchess County (1932) and a large house in the Catskill village of Ellenville (1934). The Group spent the summer of 1936 at Pine Brook Country Club in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Its final summer retreat was at Lake Grove, in Smithtown, New York, in 1939. Odets&#x27;s exposure to Strasberg&#x27;s philosophy was essential to his development as a playwright. He said in an interview late in life, &quot;My chief influence as a playwright was the Group Theatre acting company, and being a member of that company ... And you can see the Group Theatre acting technique crept right into the plays.&quot;

Odets became the first produced Method-trained playwright with his first publicly presented play, the one-act &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;, on January 6, 1935, at the former Civic Repertory Theatre on Fourteenth Street in New York City. The occasion was a benefit performance for &quot;New Theatre Magazine&quot;. Like Lawson, a member of the Communist Party, Odets was by this time influenced by Marxism and his plays became increasingly political. &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; was inspired by the 1934 New York City taxi strike and is written in the format of a minstrel show with interconnected scenes depicting social and economic dilemmas of workers in various fields. The focus alternates between a union meeting of taxi drivers and vignettes from the workers&#x27; fraught lives. A young medical intern falls victim to anti-Semitism; a laboratory assistant&#x27;s job is threatened if he refuses to spy on a colleague; couples are thwarted in marriage and torn apart by the hopelessness of economic conditions caused by the Depression. The climax is a defiant call for the taxi drivers&#x27; union to strike, which brought the entire opening night audience to its feet with tumultuous applause. The play does not require a proscenium stage and can be performed in any acting space, including union meeting halls and on the street. &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;&#x27;s unexpectedly wild success brought Odets international fame, though its strong pro-union bent caused it to be banned in many U.S. towns and cities. It was produced by a number of left-wing theaters in Britain, Australia, and other English-speaking countries, and has been widely translated. 

&quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; was written in 1933 and finally produced by the Group Theatre in February 1935 after the success of &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;. This first of Odets&#x27;s full-length plays is generally regarded as his masterpiece and has been cited as &quot;the earliest quintessential Jewish play outside the Yiddish theatre.&quot; The play concerns the Berger family, who struggle to maintain some respectability and self-esteem in the Longwood section of the Bronx while grappling with the stresses of economic collapse. Odets&#x27;s choice to open the play in medias res, his heightened dialogue style, its blatant bias towards the working class, and the fact that it was the first play on Broadway to focus entirely on a Jewish family distinguish &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; from other full-length plays produced on Broadway during this time.

Odets became the Group&#x27;s signature playwright with the debuts of &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; and &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; and his reputation is inextricably connected with the Group Theatre.

The two 1935 one-acts &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; and the anti-Nazi &quot;Till the Day I Die,&quot; along with a number of other works by various playwrights produced by the Group Theatre, are harsh criticisms of profiteers and exploitative economic systems during the Great Depression. They have been dismissed by some critics as left-wing propaganda. But &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; is considered iconic in the agitprop genre, is widely translated and anthologized, and continues to be popular. Odets asserted that all of his plays deal with the human spirit persevering in the face of any opponent, whether or not the characters are depicted as struggling with the capitalist system. The highly successful &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1937) portrays a young man torn between artistic and material fulfillment. Ironically, it was the Group Theatre&#x27;s biggest commercial success. From &quot;Golden Boy&quot; on, Odets&#x27;s work focused more on the dynamics of interpersonal relationships as affected by the moral dilemmas of individual characters. In 1938 the Group presented &quot;Rocket to the Moon&quot;, a psychological play that explores the failure of human beings to fulfill their creative potential. Leftist critics rebuked Odets for abandoning his formerly overt political stance and the play was only modestly successful. The playwright George S. Kaufman and others asked, &quot;Odets, where is thy sting?&quot; Nonetheless, &quot;Rocket to the Moon&quot; garnered enough attention to place Odets on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in December 1938.

&quot;Rocket to the Moon&quot; was followed by &quot;Night Music&quot; (1940) and &quot;Clash by Night&quot; (1941), neither of which was successful. Except for his adaptation of Konstantin Simonov&#x27;s play &quot;The Russian People&quot; in the 1942–43 season, Odets did not have another Broadway production until 1949. &quot;The Big Knife&quot; is an allegory about the damaging effects of fame and money on the character of the artist; it also alludes indirectly to the politics of the early Cold War period. The play&#x27;s harsh critique of Hollywood mores was interpreted as ingratitude on the part of Odets, who had by this time made a significant amount of money writing films. It ran only three months and lost money at the box office.

Odets&#x27;s 1950 play &quot;The Country Girl&quot; focuses on the effects of alcohol abuse on creativity and marital relations. It was a critical and box-office success and later adapted for a film starring Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly. Both actors earned Academy Award nominations for their performances. Kelly won Best Actress for her work in the film, and screenwriter George Seaton received an Oscar for his adaptation. Odets&#x27;s last play was produced on Broadway in 1954. &quot;The Flowering Peach&quot; was the preferred choice of the Pulitzer Prize jury in 1955, but under pressure from Joseph Pulitzer Jr., the prize instead was given to Tennessee Williams for &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, which the jury had considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees.

=== Hollywood ===

The immediate success of Odets&#x27;s early plays attracted the attention of Hollywood producers. He first went to Hollywood in early 1936 to write for the screen as well as the stage. From this point on he spent most of his life in Hollywood. His initial intention was to make money to help subsidize the Group Theatre&#x27;s run of his 1935 play &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; over which the critics were divided, and to help him fulfill his own financial obligations. His first screenplay was produced by Paramount and directed by Lewis Milestone. Starring Gary Cooper and Madeleine Carroll, &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; (1936) received some positive reviews, though Frank Nugent of the New York &quot;Times&quot; headed his review, &quot;Odets, Where Is thy Sting?&quot;—a phrase that dogged Odets for the rest of his life.

Like most screenwriters of the time, Odets worked within the studio system until independent production companies gained prominence in the 1950s. Thus he often wrote drafts for films such as &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; that were handed off to another screenwriter or team for further development. Odets declined to be credited for many of the films on which he worked, but did accept full credit as both screenwriter and director for &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944), adapted from the novel by Richard Llewellyn and produced by RKO. The film starred Cary Grant, Ethel Barrymore (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), Barry Fitzgerald, and Jane Wyatt.

Odets wrote the 1957 screenplay for &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, based on the novelette and a first draft by Ernest Lehman and produced by the independent company Hecht-Hill-Lancaster. Starring Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis, this film noir depicts the underbelly of the newspaper world. The character of J. J. Hunsecker, played by Lancaster, was voted the 35th most despicable villain in 100 years of film by the American Film Institute. Odets directed one other film, for which he also wrote the screenplay, &quot;The Story on Page One&quot; (1959).

Four of Odets&#x27;s plays—&quot;Golden Boy&quot;, &quot;Clash by Night&quot;, &quot;The Big Knife&quot; and &quot;The Country Girl&quot;—have been made into films, though Odets did not write the screenplays.

== Style ==
Odets&#x27;s dramatic style is distinguished by a kind of poetic, metaphor-laden street talk. Arthur Miller observed that, with Odets&#x27;s first plays, &quot;For the very first time in America, language itself ... marked a playwright as unique.&quot; Odets&#x27;s use of local urban speech patterns reflects the influence of Seán O&#x27;Casey, another socialist playwright with proletarian concerns. Other hallmarks of Odets&#x27;s style are his humanistic point of view, and his way of dropping the audience right into the conflict with little or no introduction. Often character is more important than plot, reflecting the influence of Anton Chekhov.

== House Committee on Un-American Activities ==
The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA; more commonly, HUAC) initiated its Hollywood Investigation in October 1947. The House Committee was investigating possible subversive communist influences in Hollywood and inevitably subpoenaed Odets in April 1952. He first testified in executive session, and on May 19 and 20 he again testified, this time in public hearing.

Odets had belonged to the Communist Party for less than a year, between 1934 and 1935, but continued to sponsor many left-wing, progressive groups, some of which were suspected communist fronts. He cooperated with HUAC to the extent that he responded to their questions and reiterated names of Communist Party members who had been previously cited by his friend and former Group colleague Elia Kazan. Before Kazan&#x27;s final testimony in April 1952, they agreed to name each other. Odets thereby avoided overt blacklisting though the Committee withheld thanks for his testimony, an omission generally construed as signifying their displeasure. He also found it increasingly difficult to garner film assignments. The negative reactions to his testimony confused him as he did not consider himself a cooperative witness. A partial transcript of Odets&#x27;s testimony can be found in Eric Bentley&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Years of Treason&quot;.

Odets was tormented by public reaction to his testimony for the rest of his life. In his autobiography, Kazan recalls incidents of Odets being accosted in New York City streets and snubbed in Hollywood restaurants after his HUAC appearance. His productivity markedly declined after the event; he finished only one play and, while he closely advised other filmmakers such as Nicholas Ray and was in demand as a script-doctor, he managed to produce only one entire screenplay of his own, along with his rewrite of Ernest Lehman&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; for the production team of Hecht-Hill-Lancaster.

=== Later years ===
In the early 1960s, Odets contracted to write four of a proposed total of 13 teleplays for &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;, NBC&#x27;s new dramatic anthology born of a plan for televised repertory theater. He also acted as script supervisor. Two of Odets&#x27;s finished scripts were aired posthumously: &quot;Big Mitch&quot; (December 10, 1963), and &quot;The Mafia Man&quot; (January 7, 1964). Odets also worked on the libretto for a projected musical version of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. He died before the project came to fruition. Playwright William Gibson, a former student of Odets&#x27;s when he taught at the Actors Studio, completed the play&#x27;s book.

Though many obituaries lamented his work in Hollywood and considered him someone who had not lived up to his promise, Kazan understood it differently. &quot;The tragedy of our times in the theatre is the tragedy of Clifford Odets,&quot; Kazan began, before defending his friend against the accusations of failure that had appeared in his obituaries. &quot;His plan, he said, was to ... come back to New York and get [some new] plays on. They&#x27;d be, he assured me, the best plays of his life ... Cliff wasn&#x27;t &#x27;shot.&#x27; ... The mind and talent were alive in the man.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Odets married actress Luise Rainer in January 1937, just months before she won her first of two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actress. They divorced in May 1940. He married actress Bette Grayson in 1943, and the couple had two children: Nora (born in 1945) and Walt (born in 1947). Odets and Grayson divorced in 1951. Nora Odets died at Long Beach, Long Island, in 2008; Walt Odets became a clinical psychologist, author, and photographer residing in Berkeley, California.

Odets also had relationships with actresses Frances Farmer, Kim Stanley, and Fay Wray.

== Death ==
Odets had long suffered from gastrointestinal distress and on July 23, 1963, was admitted to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles to undergo treatment for stomach ulcers. During surgery, doctors discovered that he had metastatic stomach cancer. He received bedside visits from such movie and theater friends as Marlon Brando, Lee Strasberg and Paula Strasberg, Jean Renoir and his wife Dido, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Shirley MacLaine, and Danny Kaye. Renoir dedicated a chapter of his autobiography to his close friendship with Odets. On August 14, 1963, Odets died of stomach cancer at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital at the age of 57.

Odets&#x27;s ashes were interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, in Glendale, California.

== Legacy ==
Odets is regarded as one of the American theater&#x27;s most important playwrights. According to Arthur Miller, &quot;An Odets play was awaited like news hot off the press, as though through him we would know what to think of ourselves and our prospects.&quot; Marian Seldes wrote that &quot;Paddy Chayefsky, who felt competitive with Odets, told an interviewer &#x27;There isn&#x27;t a writer of my generation, especially a New York writer, who doesn&#x27;t owe his very breath—his entire attitude toward theatre—to Odets.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Golden Boy&quot; was made into a 1939 film and became the basis for a 1964 musical of the same name. &quot;The Flowering Peach&quot; became the basis for the 1970 Broadway musical &quot;Two by Two&quot;, which starred Danny Kaye. Odets&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; became the basis for the 2002 musical of the same name starring John Lithgow.

Lincoln Center celebrated the centennial of Odets&#x27;s birth with their 2006 production of &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;, directed by Bartlett Sher. It won that year&#x27;s Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play and sparked an ongoing revival of interest in Odets&#x27;s work. Another centennial production, &quot;Rocket to the Moon&quot;, directed by Daniel Fish, was produced by Long Wharf Theater. American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts produced &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; in 2010, also directed by Daniel Fish. &quot;Golden Boy&quot; was produced by Lincoln Center with Bartlett Sher again directing. It opened on December 5, 2012, to enthusiastic reviews, subsequently garnering 8 Tony Award nominations. John Lahr declared &quot;In this distinguished, almost symphonic production, Sher and Lincoln Center have done a great thing: they have put Odets finally and forever in the pantheon, where he belongs.&quot;

Odets&#x27;s early, more left-wing plays, such as &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;, &quot;Awake and Sing!,&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; have enjoyed numerous revivals since the 2008 economic crash. The Roundabout Theatre Company presented the first revival of Odets&#x27;s 1949 play &quot;The Big Knife&quot; in 2013 at the American Airlines Theatre in New York, with Doug Hughes directing Bobby Cannavale in the lead role of Charlie Castle. The role was originated by Odets&#x27;s former Group Theatre colleague John Garfield. The National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) mounted a highly acclaimed production of &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; in 2013 with an all-Asian cast. Performed in a small downtown theatre space in New York&#x27;s Soho area, the limited run played to sold-out houses. According to &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Anita Gates, &quot;the production easily makes the point that ethnicity is transcended by the humanity of frightened, imperfect people facing unpleasant realities.&quot; NAATCO was invited by the Public Theater to revive the production under its auspices in 2015.

Joel and Ethan Coen&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Barton Fink&quot; contains a number of indirect visual and historical references to Odets&#x27;s personal appearance, background and career. A minor character in the 1982 film &quot;Diner&quot; speaks only lines from Odets&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;. The Odets character was played by Jeffrey DeMunn in the film &quot;Frances&quot;, and by John Heard in the 1983 biography &quot;Will There Be A Morning?&quot;, both about Frances Farmer.

Odets is mentioned in an episode of the television series &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Wrap Party.&quot; The episode&#x27;s subplot dealt with The Hollywood Ten.

Odets is a character in &quot;Names&quot;, Mark Kemble&#x27;s play about former Group Theatre members&#x27; struggles in the blacklist era.

Odets was the subject of a psycho-biography by psychoanalyst Margaret Brenman-Gibson: &quot;Clifford Odets – American Playwright – The Years from 1906–1940&quot;. It was one component of an umbrella project Brenman-Gibson undertook on the subject of creativity. The biography was intended to be a three-volume work, with the second and third volumes to cover the final 23 years of Odets&#x27;s life. Brenman-Gibson died in 2004, leaving the project unfinished. A full-length biography of Odets is in progress with the cooperation of the Odets Estate, to be published by Random House Doubleday Knopf.

Apart from Brenman-Gibson&#x27;s work, six critical biographies have appeared: by R. Baird Shuman (1962); Edward Murray (1968); Michael Mendelsohn (1969); Gerald Weales (1971); Harold Cantor (1978); and Christopher J. Herr (2003).

Odets was named a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

<doc id="545859" wikidata="Q2033488" url="?curid=545859" title="Security Account Manager">
<text>The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8.1, 10 and 11 that stores users&#x27; passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. Beginning with Windows 2000 SP4, Active Directory authenticates remote users. SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users accessing the system.

The user passwords are stored in a hashed format in a registry hive either as an LM hash or as an NTLM hash. This file can be found in codice_1 and is mounted on codice_2 and codice_3 privileges are required to view it.

In an attempt to improve the security of the SAM database against offline software cracking, Microsoft introduced the SYSKEY function in Windows NT 4.0. When SYSKEY is enabled, the on-disk copy of the SAM file is partially encrypted, so that the password hash values for all local accounts stored in the SAM are encrypted with a key (usually also referred to as the &quot;SYSKEY&quot;). It can be enabled by running the codice_4 program. As of Windows 10 version 1709, codice_4 was removed due to a combination of insecure security and misuse by bad actors to lock users out of systems.

==Cryptanalysis==
In 2012, it was demonstrated that every possible 8-character NTLM password hash permutation can be cracked in under 6 hours.
In 2019, this time was reduced to roughly 2.5 hours by using more modern hardware.

In the case of online attacks, it is not possible to simply copy the SAM file to another location. The SAM file cannot be moved or copied while Windows is running, since the Windows kernel obtains and keeps an exclusive filesystem lock on the SAM file, and will not release that lock until the operating system has shut down or a &quot;Blue Screen of Death&quot; exception has been thrown. However, the in-memory copy of the contents of the SAM can be dumped using various techniques (including pwdump), making the password hashes available for offline brute-force attack.

===Removing LM hash===
LM hash is a compromised protocol and has been replaced by NTLM hash. Most versions of Windows can be configured to disable the creation and storage of valid LM hashes when the user changes their password. Windows Vista and later versions of Windows disable LM hash by default. Note: enabling this setting does not immediately clear the LM hash values from the SAM, but rather enables an additional check during password change operations that will instead store a &quot;dummy&quot; value in the location in the SAM database where the LM hash is otherwise stored. (This dummy value has no relationship to the user&#x27;s password - it is the same value used for all user accounts.)

===Related attacks===
In Windows NT 3.51, NT 4.0 and 2000, an attack was devised to bypass the local authentication system. If the SAM file is deleted from the hard drive (e.g. mounting the Windows OS volume into an alternate operating system), the attacker could log in as any account with no password. This flaw was corrected with Windows XP, which shows an error message and shuts down the computer. However, there exist software utilities, which, by the aforementioned methodology of using either an emulated virtual drive, or boot disk (usually Unix/Linux, or another copy of Windows like Windows Preinstallation Environment) based environment to mount the local drive housing the active NTFS partition, and using programmed software routines and function calls from within assigned memory stacks to isolate the SAM file from the Windows NT system installation directory structure (default: codice_1) and, depending on the particular software utility being used, removes the password hashes stored for user accounts in their entirety, or in some cases, modify the user account passwords directly from this environment.

This software has both a highly pragmatic and beneficial use as a password clearing or account recovering utility for individuals who have lost or forgotten their Windows account passwords, as well as a possible use as a malicious software security bypassing utility. Essentially granting a user with enough ability, experience, and familiarity with both the cracking utility software and the security routines of the Windows NT kernel (as well as offline and immediate local access to the target computer) the capability to entirely bypass or remove the Windows account passwords from a potential target computer. Only recently, Microsoft released a utility called LockSmith, which is part of Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT). DaRT is not freely available to end-users, however.

In July 2021, it was revealed there was a vulnerability within Windows 10 and Windows 11 that allowed low privileged users to access sensitive Registry database files including the SAM file.

<doc id="545861" wikidata="Q4903541" url="?curid=545861" title="Bicategory">
<text>In mathematics, a bicategory (or a weak 2-category) is a concept in category theory used to extend the notion of category to handle the cases where the composition of morphisms is not (strictly) associative, but only associative &quot;up to&quot; an isomorphism. The notion was introduced in 1967 by Jean Bénabou.

Bicategories may be considered as a weakening of the definition of 2-categories. A similar process for 3-categories leads to tricategories, and more generally to weak &quot;n&quot;-categories for &quot;n&quot;-categories.

== Definition ==
Formally, a bicategory B consists of:
* objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, ... called 0-&quot;cells&quot;;
* morphisms &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, ... with fixed source and target objects called 1-&quot;cells&quot;;
* &quot;morphisms between morphisms&quot; ρ, σ, ... with fixed source and target morphisms (which should have themselves the same source and the same target), called 2-&quot;cells&quot;;
with some more structure:
* given two objects &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; there is a category B(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) whose objects are the 1-cells and morphisms are the 2-cells. The composition in this category is called &quot;vertical composition&quot;;
* given three objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, there is a bifunctor formula_1 called &quot;horizontal composition&quot;.
The horizontal composition is required to be associative up to a natural isomorphism α between morphisms formula_2 and formula_3. Some more coherence axioms, similar to those needed for monoidal categories, are moreover required to hold: a monoidal category is the same as a bicategory with one 0-cell.

== Example: Boolean monoidal category ==
Consider a simple monoidal category, such as the monoidal preorder Bool based on the monoid M = ({T, F}, ∧, T). As a category this is presented with two objects {T, F} and single morphism &quot;g&quot;: F → T.

We can reinterpret this monoid as a bicategory with a single object &quot;x&quot; (one 0-cell); this construction is analogous to construction of a small category from a monoid. The objects {T, F} become morphisms, and the morphism &quot;g&quot; becomes a natural transformation (forming a functor category for the single hom-category B(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;)).

<doc id="545863" wikidata="Q2142864" url="?curid=545863" title="Step response">
<text>The step response of a system in a given initial state consists of the time evolution of its outputs when its control inputs are Heaviside step functions. In electronic engineering and control theory, step response is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one in a very short time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.

From a practical standpoint, knowing how the system responds to a sudden input is important because large and possibly fast deviations from the long term steady state may have extreme effects on the component itself and on other portions of the overall system dependent on this component. In addition, the overall system cannot act until the component&#x27;s output settles down to some vicinity of its final state, delaying the overall system response. Formally, knowing the step response of a dynamical system gives information on the stability of such a system, and on its ability to reach one stationary state when starting from another.

== Formal mathematical description ==

This section provides a formal mathematical definition of step response in terms of the abstract mathematical concept of a dynamical system formula_1: all notations and assumptions required for the following description are listed here. 
*formula_2 is the evolution parameter of the system, called &quot;time&quot; for the sake of simplicity,
*formula_3 is the state of the system at time formula_4, called &quot;output&quot; for the sake of simplicity,
*formula_5 is the dynamical system evolution function,
*formula_6 is the dynamical system initial state,
*formula_7 is the Heaviside step function

=== Nonlinear dynamical system ===
For a general dynamical system, the step response is defined as follows:

:formula_8

It is the evolution function when the control inputs (or source term, or forcing inputs) are Heaviside functions: the notation emphasizes this concept showing &quot;H&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as a subscript.

=== Linear dynamical system ===
For a linear time-invariant (LTI) black box, let formula_9 for notational convenience: the step response can be obtained by convolution of the Heaviside step function control and the impulse response &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) of the system itself

:formula_10

which for an LTI system is equivalent to just integrating the latter. Conversely, for an LTI system, the derivative of the step response yields the impulse response:

:formula_11

However, these simple relations are not true for a non-linear or time-variant system.

== Time domain versus frequency domain ==
Instead of frequency response, system performance may be specified in terms of parameters describing time-dependence of response. The step response can be described by the following quantities related to its &quot;time behavior&quot;,

*overshoot
*rise time
*settling time
*ringing

In the case of linear dynamic systems, much can be inferred about the system from these characteristics. Below the step response of a simple two-pole amplifier is presented, and some of these terms are illustrated.

In LTI systems, the function that has the steepest slew rate that doesn&#x27;t create overshoot or ringing is the Gaussian function. This is because it is the only function whose Fourier transform has the same shape.

==Feedback amplifiers==
This section describes the step response of a simple negative feedback amplifier shown in Figure 1. The feedback amplifier consists of a main open-loop amplifier of gain &quot;A&quot;OL and a feedback loop governed by a feedback factor β. This feedback amplifier is analyzed to determine how its step response depends upon the time constants governing the response of the main amplifier, and upon the amount of feedback used.

A negative-feedback amplifier has gain given by (see negative feedback amplifier):

:formula_12

where &quot;A&quot;OL = open-loop gain, &quot;A&quot;FB = closed-loop gain (the gain with negative feedback present) and &quot;β&quot; = feedback factor.

===With one dominant pole===
In many cases, the forward amplifier can be sufficiently well modeled in terms of a single dominant pole of time constant τ, that it, as an open-loop gain given by:

:formula_13

with zero-frequency gain &quot;A&quot;0 and angular frequency ω = 2π&quot;f&quot;. This forward amplifier has unit step response

:formula_14,

an exponential approach from 0 toward the new equilibrium value of &quot;A&quot;0.

The one-pole amplifier&#x27;s transfer function leads to the closed-loop gain:

:formula_15

This closed-loop gain is of the same form as the open-loop gain: a one-pole filter. Its step response is of the same form: an exponential decay toward the new equilibrium value. But the time constant of the closed-loop step function is &quot;τ&quot; / (1 + &quot;β&quot; &quot;A&quot;0), so it is faster than the forward amplifier&#x27;s response by a factor of 1 + &quot;β&quot; &quot;A&quot;0:

:formula_16

As the feedback factor &quot;β&quot; is increased, the step response will get faster, until the original assumption of one dominant pole is no longer accurate. If there is a second pole, then as the closed-loop time constant approaches the time constant of the second pole, a two-pole analysis is needed.

===Two-pole amplifiers===
In the case that the open-loop gain has two poles (two time constants, &quot;τ&quot;1, &quot;τ&quot;2), the step response is a bit more complicated. The open-loop gain is given by:

:formula_17

with zero-frequency gain &quot;A&quot;0 and angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; = 2&quot;πf&quot;.

====Analysis====
The two-pole amplifier&#x27;s transfer function leads to the closed-loop gain:

:formula_18

The time dependence of the amplifier is easy to discover by switching variables to &quot;s&quot; = &quot;j&quot;ω, whereupon the gain becomes:

:formula_19

The poles of this expression (that is, the zeros of the denominator) occur at:

:formula_20

which shows for large enough values of &quot;βA&quot;0 the square root becomes the square root of a negative number, that is the square root becomes imaginary, and the pole positions are complex conjugate numbers, either &quot;s&quot;+ or &quot;s&quot;−; see Figure 2:

:formula_21

with

:formula_22

and
:formula_23
Using polar coordinates with the magnitude of the radius to the roots given by |&quot;s&quot;| (Figure 2):

:formula_24

and the angular coordinate φ is given by:

: formula_25
Tables of Laplace transforms show that the time response of such a system is composed of combinations of the two functions:

:formula_26

which is to say, the solutions are damped oscillations in time. In particular, the unit step response of the system is:
:formula_27

which simplifies to

:formula_28

when &quot;A&quot;0 tends to infinity and the feedback factor &quot;β&quot; is one.

Notice that the damping of the response is set by ρ, that is, by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier. In contrast, the frequency of oscillation is set by μ, that is, by the feedback parameter through β&quot;A&quot;0. Because ρ is a sum of reciprocals of time constants, it is interesting to notice that ρ is dominated by the &quot;shorter&quot; of the two.

====Results====

Figure 3 shows the time response to a unit step input for three values of the parameter μ. It can be seen that the frequency of oscillation increases with μ, but the oscillations are contained between the two asymptotes set by the exponentials [ 1 − exp(−&quot;ρt&quot;) ] and [ 1 + exp(−ρt) ]. These asymptotes are determined by ρ and therefore by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier, independent of feedback.

The phenomenon of oscillation about the final value is called ringing. The overshoot is the maximum swing above final value, and clearly increases with μ. Likewise, the undershoot is the minimum swing below final value, again increasing with μ. The settling time is the time for departures from final value to sink below some specified level, say 10% of final value.

The dependence of settling time upon μ is not obvious, and the approximation of a two-pole system probably is not accurate enough to make any real-world conclusions about feedback dependence of settling time. However, the asymptotes [ 1 − exp(−&quot;ρt&quot;) ] and [ 1 + exp (−&quot;ρt&quot;) ] clearly impact settling time, and they are controlled by the time constants of the open-loop amplifier, particularly the shorter of the two time constants. That suggests that a specification on settling time must be met by appropriate design of the open-loop amplifier.

The two major conclusions from this analysis are: 
#Feedback controls the amplitude of oscillation about final value for a given open-loop amplifier and given values of open-loop time constants, τ1 and τ2.
#The open-loop amplifier decides settling time. It sets the time scale of Figure 3, and the faster the open-loop amplifier, the faster this time scale.

As an aside, it may be noted that real-world departures from this linear two-pole model occur due to two major complications: first, real amplifiers have more than two poles, as well as zeros; and second, real amplifiers are nonlinear, so their step response changes with signal amplitude.
====Control of overshoot====
How overshoot may be controlled by appropriate parameter choices is discussed next.

Using the equations above, the amount of overshoot can be found by differentiating the step response and finding its maximum value. The result for maximum step response &quot;S&quot;max is:

:formula_29

The final value of the step response is 1, so the exponential is the actual overshoot itself. It is clear the overshoot is zero if &quot;μ&quot; = 0, which is the condition:

:formula_30

This quadratic is solved for the ratio of time constants by setting &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;τ&quot;1 / &quot;τ&quot;2)1/2 with the result

:formula_31

Because β &quot;A&quot;0 ≫ 1, the 1 in the square root can be dropped, and the result is

:formula_32

In words, the first time constant must be much larger than the second. To be more adventurous than a design allowing for no overshoot we can introduce a factor &quot;α&quot; in the above relation:

:formula_33

and let α be set by the amount of overshoot that is acceptable.

Figure 4 illustrates the procedure. Comparing the top panel (α = 4) with the lower panel (α = 0.5) shows lower values for α increase the rate of response, but increase overshoot. The case α = 2 (center panel) is the &quot;maximally flat&quot; design that shows no peaking in the Bode gain vs. frequency plot. That design has the rule of thumb built-in safety margin to deal with non-ideal realities like multiple poles (or zeros), nonlinearity (signal amplitude dependence) and manufacturing variations, any of which can lead to too much overshoot. The adjustment of the pole separation (that is, setting α) is the subject of frequency compensation, and one such method is pole splitting.

====Control of settling time ====
The amplitude of ringing in the step response in Figure 3 is governed by the damping factor exp(−&quot;ρt&quot;). That is, if we specify some acceptable step response deviation from final value, say Δ, that is:

:formula_34

this condition is satisfied regardless of the value of β &quot;A&quot;OL provided the time is longer than the settling time, say &quot;t&quot;S, given by:

:formula_35

where the τ1 ≫ τ2 is applicable because of the overshoot control condition, which makes &quot;τ&quot;1 = &quot;αβA&quot;OL τ2. Often the settling time condition is referred to by saying the settling period is inversely proportional to the unity gain bandwidth, because 1/(2&quot;π&quot; &quot;τ&quot;2) is close to this bandwidth for an amplifier with typical dominant pole compensation. However, this result is more precise than this rule of thumb. As an example of this formula, if the settling time condition is &quot;t&quot;S = 8 &quot;τ&quot;2.

In general, control of overshoot sets the time constant ratio, and settling time &quot;t&quot;S sets τ2.

==== System Identification using the Step Response: System with two real poles ====

This method uses significant points of the step response. There is no need to guess tangents to the measured Signal. The equations are derived using numerical simulations, determining some significant ratios and fitting parameters of nonlinear equations. See also.

Here the steps:

* Measure the system step-response formula_36of the system with an input step signal formula_37.
* Determine the time-spans formula_38and formula_39where the step response reaches 25% and 75% of the steady state output value.
* Determine the system steady-state gain formula_40with formula_41
* Calculate formula_42 formula_43 formula_44
* Determine the two time constants formula_45 formula_46

Next, the choice of pole ratio &quot;τ&quot;1/&quot;τ&quot;2 is related to the phase margin of the feedback amplifier. The procedure outlined in the Bode plot article is followed. Figure 5 is the Bode gain plot for the two-pole amplifier in the range of frequencies up to the second pole position. The assumption behind Figure 5 is that the frequency &quot;f&quot;0 dB lies between the lowest pole at &quot;f&quot;1 = 1/(2πτ1) and the second pole at &quot;f&quot;2 = 1/(2πτ2). As indicated in Figure 5, this condition is satisfied for values of α ≥ 1.

Using Figure 5 the frequency (denoted by &quot;f&quot;0 dB) is found where the loop gain β&quot;A&quot;0 satisfies the unity gain or 0 dB condition, as defined by:

:formula_48

The slope of the downward leg of the gain plot is (20 dB/decade); for every factor of ten increase in frequency, the gain drops by the same factor:

:formula_49

The phase margin is the departure of the phase at &quot;f&quot;0 dB from −180°. Thus, the margin is:

:formula_50

Because &quot;f&quot;0 dB / &quot;f&quot;1 = &quot;βA&quot;0 ≫ 1, the term in &quot;f&quot;1 is 90°. That makes the phase margin:

:formula_51

In particular, for case &quot;α&quot; = 1, &quot;φ&quot;m = 45°, and for &quot;α&quot; = 2, &quot;φ&quot;m = 63.4°. Sansen recommends &quot;α&quot; = 3, &quot;φ&quot;m = 71.6° as a &quot;good safety position to start with&quot;.

If α is increased by shortening &quot;τ&quot;2, the settling time &quot;t&quot;S also is shortened. If &quot;α&quot; is increased by lengthening &quot;τ&quot;1, the settling time &quot;t&quot;S is little altered. More commonly, both &quot;τ&quot;1 &quot;and&quot; &quot;τ&quot;2 change, for example if the technique of pole splitting is used.

As an aside, for an amplifier with more than two poles, the diagram of Figure 5 still may be made to fit the Bode plots by making &quot;f&quot;2 a fitting parameter, referred to as an &quot;equivalent second pole&quot; position.

<text>The Federal Theatre Project (FTP; 1935–1939) was a theatre program established during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal to fund live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States. It was one of five Federal Project Number One projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration, created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors, and theater workers. National director Hallie Flanagan shaped the FTP into a federation of regional theaters that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation in new forms and techniques, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time. Although The Federal Theatre project consumed only 0.5% of the allocated budget from the WPA and was widely considered a commercial and critical success, the project became a source of heated political contention. Congress responded to the project&#x27;s racial integration and accusations of Communist infiltration and cancelled its funding effective June 30, 1939. One month before the project&#x27;s end, drama critic Brooks Atkinson summarized: &quot;Although the Federal Theatre is far from perfect, it has kept an average of ten thousand people employed on work that has helped to lift the dead weight from the lives of millions of Americans. It has been the best friend the theatre as an institution has ever had in this country.&quot;

==Background==
Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project was a New Deal program established August 27, 1935, funded under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. Of the $4.88 billion allocated to the WPA, $27 million was approved for the employment of artists, musicians, writers and actors under the WPA&#x27;s Federal Project Number One.

Government relief efforts funding theatre through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and Civil Works Administration in the two preceding years were amateur experiments regarded as charity, not a theatre program. The Federal Theatre Project was a new approach to unemployment in the theatre profession. Only those certified as employable could be offered work, and that work was to be within the individual&#x27;s defined skills and trades.

&quot;For the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect, became important,&quot; wrote Hallie Flanagan, director of the Federal Theatre Project. A theater professor at Vassar College who had studied the operation of government-sponsored theatre abroad for the Guggenheim Foundation, Flanagan was chosen to lead the Federal Theatre Project by WPA head Harry Hopkins. Flanagan and Hopkins had been classmates at Grinnell College. Roosevelt and Hopkins selected her despite considerable pressure to choose someone from the commercial theatre industry; they believed the project should be led by someone with academic credentials and a national perspective.
Flanagan had the daunting task of building a nationwide theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. The Theatre industry had struggled financially prior to the financial collapse of 1929. By that time it was already threatened with extinction due to the growing popularity of films and radio, but the commercial theatre was reluctant to adapt its practices. Many actors, technicians and stagehands had suffered since 1914, when movies began to replace stock, vaudeville and other live stage performances nationwide. Sound motion pictures displaced 30,000 musicians. In the Great Depression, people with little money for entertainment found an entire evening of entertainment at the movies for 25 cents, while commercial theatre charged $1.10 to $2.20 admission to cover the cost of theater rental, advertising and fees to performers and union technicians. Unemployed directors, actors, designers, musicians and stage crew took any kind of work they were able to find, whatever it paid, and charity was often their only recourse.

&quot;This is a tough job we&#x27;re asking you to do,&quot; Hopkins told Flanagan at their first meeting in May 1935. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why I still hang on to the idea that unemployed actors get just as hungry as anybody else.&quot;

Hopkins promised &quot;a free, adult, uncensored theatre&quot; — something Flanagan spent the next four years trying to build. She emphasized the development of local and regional theatre, &quot;to lay the foundation for the development of a truly creative theatre in the United States with outstanding producing centers in each of those regions which have common interests as a result of geography, language origins, history, tradition, custom, occupations of the people.&quot;

==Operation==
On October 24, 1935, Flanagan prefaced her instructions on the Federal Theatre&#x27;s operation with a statement of purpose:

The primary aim of the Federal Theatre Project is the reemployment of theatre workers now on public relief rolls: actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians, and other workers in the theatre field. The far reaching purpose is the establishment of theatres so vital to community life that they will continue to function after the program of this Federal Project is completed.

Within a year the Federal Theatre Project employed 15,000 men and women, paying them $23.86 a week while the Actors Equity Association&#x27;s minimum was $40.00. These men and women would only do six performances a week and have only four hours per day to rehearse. During its nearly four years of existence 30 million people attended FTP productions in more than 200 theaters nationwide — renting many that had been shuttered — as well as parks, schools, churches, clubs, factories, hospitals and closed-off streets. Its productions totaled approximately 1,200, not including its radio programs. Because the Federal Theatre was created to employ and train people, not to generate revenue, no provision was made for the receipt of money when the project began. At its conclusion, 65 percent of its productions were still presented free of charge. The total cost of the Federal Theatre Project was $46 million.

&quot;In any consideration of the cost of the Federal Theatre,&quot; Flanagan wrote, &quot;it should be borne in mind that the funds were allotted, according to the terms of the Relief Act of 1935, to pay wages to unemployed people. Therefore, when Federal Theatre was criticized for spending money, it was criticized for doing what it was set up to do.&quot;

The FTP established five regional centers in New York, New York, Boston (Northeast), Chicago (Midwest), Los Angeles (West), and New Orleans (South). The FTP did not operate in every state, since many lacked a sufficient number of unemployed people in the theatre profession. The project in Alabama was closed in January 1937 when its personnel were transferred to a new unit in Georgia. Only one event was presented in Arkansas. Units created in Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were closed in 1936; projects in Indiana, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Texas were discontinued in 1937; and the Iowa project was closed in 1938.

Many of the notable artists of the time participated in the Federal Theatre Project, including Susan Glaspell who served as Midwest bureau director. The legacy of the Federal Theatre Project can also be found in beginning the careers of a new generation of theater artists. Arthur Miller, Orson Welles, John Houseman, Martin Ritt, Elia Kazan, Joseph Losey, Marc Blitzstein and Abe Feder are among those who became established, in part, through their work in the Federal Theatre. Blitzstein, Houseman, Welles and Feder collaborated on the controversial production, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;.

==Living Newspaper==

Living Newspapers were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like farm policy, syphilis (spirochete) infection, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with progressive or left-wing themes. &quot;Triple-A Plowed Under,&quot; for instance, attacked the U.S. Supreme Court for killing the Agricultural Adjustment Act. These politically themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of Congress.

Although the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspaper productions sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences. As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the Federal Theatre&#x27;s most well-known work.

Problems with the Federal Theatre Project and Congress intensified when the State Department objected to the first Living Newspaper, &quot;Ethiopia&quot;, about Haile Selassie and his nation&#x27;s struggles against Benito Mussolini&#x27;s invading Italian forces. The U.S. government soon mandated that the FTP, a government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director Elmer Rice, head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest and was succeeded by his assistant, Philip W. Barber.

==African-American theatre==

Capitalizing on the FTP&#x27;s national network and inherent diversity of artists, the Federal Theatre established specific chapters dedicated to showcasing and celebrating the work of previously under-represented artists. Including the French Theatre in Los Angeles, the German Theater in New York City, and the Negro Theatre Unit which had several chapters across the country, with its largest office in New York City. The FTP set up 17 so-called Negro Theatre Units (NTU) in cities throughout the United States. The NTU had additional offices in Hartford, Boston, Salem, Newark, and Philadelphia in the East; Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles in the West; Cleveland, Detroit, Peoria, and Chicago in the Midwest; and Raleigh, Atlanta, Birmingham, and New Orleans in the South. There were additional units in San Francisco, Oklahoma, Durham, Camden, and Buffalo. By the project&#x27;s conclusion, 22 American cities had served as headquarters for black theater units.

The New York Negro Theatre Unit was the most well known. Two of the four federal theaters in New York City—Lafayette Theatre and the Negro Youth Theater— were dedicated to the Harlem community with the intention of developing unknown theatre artists.

Both theatre projects were headquartered at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem, where some 30 plays were presented. The first was Frank H. Wilson&#x27;s folk drama, &quot;Walk Together Chillun&quot; (1936), about the deportation of 100 African-Americans from the South to the North to work for low wages. The second was &quot;Conjur&#x27; Man Dies&quot; (1936), a comedy-mystery adapted by Arna Bontemps and Countee Cullen from Rudolph Fisher&#x27;s novel. The most popular production was the third, which came to be called the &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot; (1936), director Orson Welles&#x27;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play set on a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe.

The New York Negro Theatre Unit also oversaw projects from the African American Dance Unit featuring Nigerian artists displaced by the Ethiopian Crisis. These projects employed over 1,000 black actors and directors. The Negro Actors&#x27; Guild of America incorporated on October 1, 1936 in the state of New York. The ten Articles for the Certificate of Incorporation addressed the welfare, appreciation and development of black artists. 

The Federal Theatre Project was distinguished for its focus on racial injustice. Flanagan expressly ordered her subordinates to follow the WPA policy against racial prejudice. In fact when it came to making decisions on a national level for the project, the Federal Theatre Regulation mandated that &quot;there may be racial representation in all national planning.&quot; A specific example of the FTP&#x27;s adherence to an anti-prejudicial environment came when a white project manager in Dallas was fired for attempting to segregate black and white theater technicians on a railroad car. Additionally, the white assistant director of the project was pulled because &quot;he was unable to work amicably&quot; with the black artists.

The FTP overtly sought out relationships with the African American community including Carter Woodson of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, as well as Walter White of the NAACP. One of the existing stipulations from the Works Progress Administration for employment in the FTP was prior professional theater experience. However, when encountered with 40 young jobless black playwrights, national director Hallie Flanagan waived the WPA requirement in the interest of providing a platform and training ground for new young playwrights. During a national conference Flanagan proposed that the leadership of the Harlem chapter of the FTP be led by an African American artist. Rose McClendon, an established actor at the time, publicly argued against this proposal and instead suggested that initially an established white theater artist take the mantle with the understanding and intention of satisfying the WPA&#x27;s prior professional theater experience clause and giving way to black artists to lead the chapter. This argument from McClendon received support from Edna Thomas, Harry Edwards, Carlton Moss, Abraham Hale Jr., Augusta Smith and Dick Campbell.

This crusade for equality eventually became a sticking point for the Dies Committee, which pulled funding for the Federal Theater Project, arguing that &quot;racial equality forms a vital part of the Communist dictatorship and practices&quot;.

==Radio==

The Federal Theatre of the Air began weekly broadcasts March 15, 1936. For three years the radio division of the Federal Theatre Project presented an average of 3,000 programs annually on commercial stations and the NBC, Mutual and CBS networks. The major programs originated in New York; radio divisions were also created in 11 states.
Series included &quot;Professional Parade&quot;, hosted by Fred Niblo; &quot;Experiments in Symphonic Drama&quot;, original stories written for classical music; &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera&quot;, the complete works performed by Federal Theatre actors and recordings by D&#x27;Oyly Carte; &quot;Ibsen&#x27;s Plays&quot;, performances of 12 major plays; &quot;Repertory Theatre of the Air&quot;, presenting literary classics; &quot;Contemporary Theatre&quot;, presenting plays by modern authors; and the interview program, &quot;Exploring the Arts and Sciences&quot;.

The radio division presented a wide range of programs on health and safety, art, music and history. The American Legion sponsored James Truslow Adams&#x27;s &quot;Epic of America&quot;. The children&#x27;s program, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, and Paul de Kruif&#x27;s &quot;Men Against Death&quot; were both honored by the National Committee for Education by Radio. In March 1939, at the invitation of the BBC, Flanagan broadcast the story of the Federal Theatre Project to Britain. Asked to expand the program to encompass the entire WPA, the radio division produced &quot;No Help Wanted&quot;, a dramatization by William N. Robson with music by Leith Stevens. &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;the best broadcast ever sent us from the Americas&quot;.

==Federal Dance Project==
The Federal Dance Project (FDP) was a short-lived entity that was ultimately absorbed into the Federal Theater Project. Dancer Helen Tamiris was the central figure of the FDP, which existed as an independent entity from January 1936 until October 1937.

== Funding pulled by Congress==

In May 1938, Martin Dies Jr., director of The House Committee on Un-American Activities specifically targeted the WPA&#x27;s Federal Theatre Project. Assailing Flanagan&#x27;s professional character and political affiliations, the committee heard testimony from former Federal Theatre Project members who were unhappy with their tenure with the project. Flanagan testified that the FTP was pro-American insofar as the work celebrated the constitutional freedoms of speech and expression to address the relevant and pressing concerns of its citizens.

Citing the Federal Theatre&#x27;s call for racial equality, impending war, and further perpetuating the rumor that the FTP was a front for radical and communist activities, Congress ended federal funding as of June 30, 1939, immediately putting 8,000 people out of work across the country. Although the overall financial cost of the FTP was minuscule in the grand scheme of the WPA&#x27;s budget, Congress determined that the average American did not consider theater a viable recipient of their tax dollars. Following the decision, Flanagan&#x27;s stepdaughter, Joanne Bentley quoted an unnamed Congressmen saying &quot;Culture! What the Hell—Let &#x27;em have a pick and shovel!&quot;

Members of Congress criticized a total of 81 of the Federal Theatre Project&#x27;s 830 major titles for their content in public statements, committee hearings, on the floor of the Senate or House, or in testimony before Congressional committees. Only 29 were original productions of the Federal Theatre Project. The others included 32 revivals or stock productions; seven plays that were initiated by community groups; five that were never produced by the project; two works of Americana; two classics; one children&#x27;s play; one Italian translation; and one Yiddish play.

The Living Newspapers productions that drew criticism were &quot;Injunction Granted&quot;, a history of American labor relations; &quot;One-Third of a Nation&quot;, about housing conditions in New York; &quot;Power&quot;, about energy from the consumer&#x27;s point of view; and &quot;Triple A Plowed Under&quot;, on farming problems in America. Another that was criticized, on the history of medicine, was not completed.

Dramas criticized by Congress were &quot;American Holiday&quot;, about a small-town murder trial; &quot;Around the Corner&quot;, a Depression-era comedy; &quot;Chalk Dust&quot;, about an urban high school; &quot;Class of &#x27;29&quot;, the Depression years as seen through young college graduates; &quot;Created Equal&quot;, a review of American life since colonial times; &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s parable of democracy and dictatorship; &quot;No More Peace&quot;, Ernst Toller&#x27;s satire on dictatorships; &quot;Professor Mamlock&quot;, about Nazi persecution of Jews; &quot;Prologue to Glory&quot;, about the early life of Abraham Lincoln; &quot;The Sun and I&quot;, about Joseph in Egypt; and &quot;Woman of Destiny&quot;, about a female President who works for peace.

Negro Theatre Unit productions that drew criticism were &quot;The Case of Philip Lawrence&quot;, a portrait of life in Harlem; &quot;Did Adam Sin?&quot;, a review of black folklore with music; and &quot;Haiti&quot;, a play about Toussaint Louverture.

Also criticized for their content were the dance dramas &quot;Candide&quot;, from Voltaire; &quot;How Long Brethren&quot;, featuring songs by future Guggenheim Fellowship recipient Lawrence Gellert; and &quot;Trojan Incident&quot;, a translation of Euripides with a prologue from Homer.

&quot;Help Yourself&quot;, a satire on high-pressure business tactics, was among the comedies criticized by Congress. Others were &quot;Machine Age&quot;, about mass production; &quot;On the Rocks&quot; by George Bernard Shaw; and &quot;The Tailor Becomes a Storekeeper&quot;.

Children&#x27;s plays singled out were &quot;Mother Goose Goes to Town&quot;, and &quot;Revolt of the Beavers&quot;, which the &quot;New York American&quot; called a &quot;pleasing fantasy for children&quot;.

The musical &quot;Sing for Your Supper&quot; also met with Congressional criticism, although its patriotic finale, &quot;Ballad for Americans&quot;, was chosen as the theme song of the 1940 Republican National Convention.

<text>Sun Yat-sen University (; SYSU) is a public research university in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, and co-funded by the Ministry of Education, SASTIND, and Guangdong Provincial Government. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

The university was founded in 1924 by and named after Sun Yat-sen, a revolutionary and the founder of the Republic of China. The university&#x27;s main campus, commonly referred to as the South Campus, is located in Haizhu, Guangzhou, inheriting the campus from the former Lingnan University (est. 1888). The university has five campuses in the three cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shenzhen, and ten affiliated hospitals.

The SYSU organised centennial celebration conference on November 12, 2024 where a number of initiatives were announced for the future.



==History==


Originally, each of the Sun Yat-sen Universities were adopted a statism educational model, () and based on Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s political philosophy, present-day Sun Yat-sen University is the result of multiple mergers as well as splits and restructurings that have involved more than a dozen academic institutions over time. The most recent merger happened in 2001, when Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Science merged with Sun Yat-sen University and became Sun Yat-sen College of Medical Science.

===Sun Yat-sen University===
In 1924, Sun Yat-sen founded National Kwangtung University () in Canton and inscribed in his own handwriting the school motto of &quot;Study Extensively, Enquire Accurately, Reflect Carefully, Discriminate Clearly, Practise Earnestly.&quot; After the death of Sun Yat-sen, the Nationalist government that was set up during the first cooperation between the Communists and Nationalists formally decreed to change its name to National Sun Yat-sen University () on July 17, 1926, in memory of Sun Yat-sen. In 1926, there were four National Sun Yat-sen Universities: National First Sun Yat-sen University in Canton (the current Sun Yat-sen University), National Second Sun Yat-sen University in Wuhan (the current Wuhan University), National Third Sun Yat-sen University in Hangzhou (the current Zhejiang University), National Fourth Sun Yat-sen University in Nanking (the predecessor of the current Nanjing University, Southeast University, and National Central University). The Nationalist government also planned to organize the National Fifth Sun Yat-sen University in Zhengzhou, but end up naming it as the Henan Provincial Sun Yat-sen University (the current Henan University).

In the 1930s, there were seven schools in the University: the Schools of Arts, Sciences, Law, Engineering, Agricultural Studies, Medicine and Education. In 1935, National Sun Yat-sen University, concurrently with National Tsinghua University and National Peking University, set up the first graduate schools in China and began to enroll graduate students.

In 1949, the University removed its prefix &quot;National&quot; and has been thereafter referred directly to Sun Yat-sen University (). In the 1950s, colleges, schools and departments were readjusted nationwide, and Sun Yat-sen University became a national top-tier comprehensive university with the liberal arts and sciences as its backbone disciplines.

===Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences===
One of the predecessors of the Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Science was the Pok Tsai Medical School, which, founded in 1866, was the earliest institution of learning of western medicine in China, where Sun Yat-sen once studied and engaged in revolutionary activities.

The Pok Tsai Medical School evolved into the College of Medicine of Lingnan University in 1936. The Kung Yee Medical School and Hospital in Guangzhou (Canton) was founded in 1908. In 1925, the Kung Yee institutions were taken over by the government and became the Medical Department of the National First Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University. In 1953, the Colleges of Medicine in Sun Yat-sen University and Lingnan University merged to form the College of Medicine of South China, which was joined by the Guangdong Guanghua College of Medicine in 1954. The university was renamed Guangzhou College of Medicine and Sun Yat-sen College of Medical Science successively, and finally Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Science in 1985, which has developed steadfastly into a comprehensive medical university with multi-schools and multiple levels, has reached national advanced level and achieved remarkable successes in scientific research in medical genetics, ophthalmology, tumor study, parasite study, the kidney disease of internal medicine, organ transplant, infectious liver disease, biological medical project and molecular medical science. In 2001, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Science merged with Sun Yat-sen University and became Sun Yat-sen College of Medical Science.

===Lingnan University===

Lingnan University () was a private university established by Andrew Happer, MD and a group of American missionaries in Guangzhou in 1888. At its founding it was named Canton Christian College (). 
The Hackett Medical College for Women (夏葛女子醫學院, the first medical college for women in China) and its affiliated hospital known as David Gregg Hospital for Women and Children (), located in Guangzhou, China, were parts of a medical center that was founded by female medical missionary Mary H. Fulton (1854-1927). Fulton was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA), with the support of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn, New York, of which David Gregg was pastor The college was dedicated in 1902 and offered a four-year medical curriculum. At the end of 1932, the medical center was registered and put under the control of the Chinese government. Furthermore, it affiliated with Guangzhou Hospital and Lingnan University to form the Sun Yat-Sen Medical College in 1936.

Lingnan University was incorporated into Sun Yat-sen University in 1953 under the order of the Communist Party&#x27;s government. Members of the university moved to Hong Kong and founded the Lingnan School in Wan Chai in 1967, which was relocated to Tuen Mun in the mid-1990s and renamed Lingnan University in 1999. In 1988, Lingnan College was reestablished within Sun Yat-sen University and is now one of the top schools of economics and management in China.

<text>Govinda (, ), also rendered Govind, Gobinda, and Gobind, is an epithet of Vishnu and his avatars, such as Krishna. The name appears as the 187th and the 539th name of Vishnu in the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot;. The name is also popularly addressed to Krishna, referring to his youthful activity as a cowherd boy.

==Etymology==
Govinda can be directly translated as &quot;protector of cows&quot;. Moreover, in the word &quot;Govinda&quot;, &quot;Govu&quot; means &quot;Indriyas&quot;. Govinda therefore means the all-pervading, omnipresent ruler of the sense organs, or &quot;Indriyas&quot;. &quot;Govu&quot; also means &#x27;Vedas&#x27;. Hence Govinda is the supreme being who can be known through the Vedas.

==Interpretations==
&quot;Govinda&quot; is a name of Krishna and also appears as the 187th and 539th name of Vishnu in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the 1,000 names of Vishnu.

According to Adi Shankara&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot;, translated by Swami Tapasyananda, Govinda has four meanings:

# The sages call Krishna &quot;Govinda&quot; as he pervades all the worlds, giving them power.
# The Shanti Parva of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; states that Vishnu restored the earth that had sunk into the netherworld, so all the &quot;devas&quot; praised him as Govinda (protector of the land).
# Alternatively, it means &quot;He who is known by Vedic words alone&quot;.
# In the Harivamsa, Indra praised Krishna for having attained loving leadership of the cows which Krishna tended as a cowherd, by saying, &quot;So men too shall praise him as Govinda.&quot;

In the Brahma Samhita, Krishna is praised as Govinda, who is eternal and origin of all living beings.

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in his commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita, states that Govinda means &quot;master of the senses&quot;. 

==Prayers==
An 8th century Hindu devotional composition called &quot;Moha Mudgara&quot;, composed by Adi Shankara, summarises: &quot;If one just worships Govinda, one can easily cross this great ocean of birth and death.&quot; This refers to the belief that worshipful adoration of Vishnu or Krishna can lead believers out of the cycle of reincarnation (&quot;samsara&quot;) and lead them into an eternal blissful life in Vaikuntha, &#x27;the supreme abode situated beyond this material world&#x27; where Govinda (Vishnu) resides. The composition expresses the value of inner devotion to Vishnu.

<doc id="545889" wikidata="Q44893" url="?curid=545889" title="Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria">
<text>Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, Duke of Bavaria, Franconia and in Swabia, Count Palatine by the Rhine (&quot;Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand&quot;; English: &quot;Rupert Maria Leopold Ferdinand&quot;; 18 May 1869 – 2 August 1955), was the last heir apparent to the Bavarian throne. During the first half of World War I, he commanded the 6th Army on the Western Front. From August 1916, he commanded Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria, which occupied the sector of the front opposite the British Expeditionary Force.

==Childhood==

Rupprecht was born in Munich, the eldest of the thirteen children of Ludwig III, the last King of Bavaria, and of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, a niece of Duke Francis V of Modena. He was a member of the lineage of both Louis XIV of France and William the Conqueror. As a direct descendant of Henrietta of England, daughter of Charles I of England, he was claimant to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland in the Jacobite succession. His early education from the age of seven was conducted by Freiherr Rolf Kreusser, an Anglo-Bavarian. In his youth, he spent much of his time at &quot;Schloss Leutstetten&quot;, Starnberg, and at the family&#x27;s villa near Lindau, Lake Constance, where he was able to develop a keen interest in sports. His education was traditional and conservative, but he became the first member of the royal house of Bavaria to spend time at a public school, when he was educated at the &quot;Maximilian-Gymnasium&quot; in Munich, where he spent four years. Apart from his academic studies and his training in riding and dancing, at school he was also obliged to learn a trade, and he chose carpentry.

==Pre-war==
Rupprecht&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Luitpold, became de facto ruler of Bavaria when King Ludwig II and his successor Otto both were declared insane in 1886. Rupprecht&#x27;s own position changed somewhat through these events as it became clear that he was likely to succeed to the Bavarian throne one day.

After graduating from high school, he entered the Bavarian Army&#x27;s &quot;Infanterie-Leibregiment&quot; as a second lieutenant. He interrupted his military career to study at the universities of Munich and Berlin from 1889 to 1891. He rose to the rank of a colonel and became the commanding officer of the &quot;2nd Infanterie Regiment Kronprinz&quot; but found enough opportunity to travel extensively to the Middle East, India, Japan and China. His early journeys were made with his adjutant, Otto von Stetten. Later he was accompanied by his first wife.

At the age of 31, Rupprecht married his kinswoman Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria, with whom he had five children before her early death in 1912 at the age of 34.

In 1900, he became the 1,128th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria.

In 1906, Rupprecht was made commander of the Bavarian I Army Corps, with the rank of lieutenant general of the infantry, promoted to full general in 1913.

In 1910 he arranged &quot;Meisterwerke muhammedanischer Kunst&quot; in Munich - the largest exhibition of Islamic art.

In 1912, Luitpold was succeeded in the position of &quot;Prince Regent&quot; by his son Ludwig. On 5 November 1913, Ludwig was made king by vote of the Bavarian Senate, becoming Ludwig III. This decision also made Rupprecht the Crown Prince of Bavaria.

Rupprecht and Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia each commanded an army on the western front (the Sixth Army and the Fifth Army, respectively) and were directly involved in the implementation of the Schlieffen Plan.

==First World War==
After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Rupprecht took command (2 August 1914) of the German Sixth Army in Lorraine. While much of the German army participated in the Schlieffen plan, the Crown Prince led his troops in the Battle of Lorraine (14 to 25 August 1914). His appointment to command the Sixth Army came as a result of his royal position, but the level of study he had performed before he took command was a factor behind his successful direction of the Sixth Army, and he proved a highly able commander. Rupprecht&#x27;s army gave way to the French attack in August 1914, in the Battle of Lorraine, and then launched a counteroffensive on 20 August. Rupprecht failed to break through the French lines. In fact he was ordered by German General Staff to only occupy the French forces in that region. It was his idea to attack more aggressively. He later commanded the 6th Army in Northern France (until August 1916), and remained on the Western Front during the stalemate that would last until the end of the war. Only a few days after the battle, his oldest son, Luitpold, died of polio in Munich (27 August 1914).

During the spring of 1915, Rupprecht sent an answer to General Moritz von Bissing, the Governor-General of Belgium, responding to Bissing&#x27;s inquiry about Bavaria&#x27;s opinion on the &quot;Belgian question&quot;. Rupprecht envisaged an economic and military association of Belgium with Germany by introducing the Netherlands (enlarged by the Flemish areas of Belgium and northern France) and Luxembourg (enlarged by Belgian Luxembourg) as new federal states of the German Empire. To the Kingdom of Prussia, Rupprecht suggested other areas of northern France, Walloon Belgium with Liege and Namur, and the salient of the Netherlands round Maastricht. The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and the rest of Lorraine was to be partitioned between Bavaria and Prussia. Rupprecht aimed to reduce Prussia&#x27;s hegemonic role in the Reich by building a sort of an imperial triumvirate of power between Prussia, Bavaria and the Netherlands. Likewise when Moltke the Younger ordered Bavarian troops to defend Prussia from the East, he declined. As a result, troops had to be withdrawn from the Belgian front – a more difficult undertaking.

In November 1915 Hermann von Kuhl became Rupprecht&#x27;s new Chief of Staff. This work relationship would last for the remainder of the war.

Rupprecht achieved the rank of field marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) in July 1916 and on 28 August that year assumed command of Army Group Rupprecht, consisting of the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th armies. Rupprecht has been considered by some one of the best royal commanders in the Imperial German Army of World War I, possibly even the only one to deserve his command. Rupprecht came to the conclusion – much earlier than most other German generals (towards the end of 1917) – that the war could not be won, given the ever-increasing material advantage of the Allies. He also opposed the &quot;scorched-earth&quot; policy during withdrawals, but his royal position made a resignation on those grounds impossible for him, even though he threatened it. He eventually resigned from his command on 11 November 1918 - the day of the armistice.

He became engaged to the much younger Princess Antonia of Luxembourg in 1918, but Germany&#x27;s capitulation delayed their marriage, and the engagement was postponed again.

===Links to military aviation===
Max Immelmann, one of the most famous German First World War flying aces, referred in a letter written on 25 June 1915 to a visit by Rupprecht to an airfield to inspect the new Fokker Eindecker aircraft.

Primarily to see these fighting machines, yesterday the Crown Prince of Bavaria visited the field and inspected us and &quot;Abteilung&quot; 20. Director Fokker, the constructor of the combat aircraft, was presented to him.
==Interwar years==

On 12 November 1918, in the wake of civil unrest in the last days of the war, Rupprecht&#x27;s father, Ludwig III, promulgated the Anif declaration releasing his officials, officers and soldiers from their oaths. Although he did not formally abdicate (and some loyalists would continue to refer to Ludwig as King), the declaration was interpreted by the government of Bavaria as an abdication, making Bavaria a republic and ending 738 years of Wittelsbach rule; Rupprecht thus lost his chance to rule Bavaria. Rupprecht escaped to Tyrol in fear of reprisals from the brief communist regime in Bavaria under Kurt Eisner but returned in September 1919. While away from Bavaria, he succeeded his mother, Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, the last Queen of Bavaria, as the Jacobite heir. This occurred upon her death on 3 February 1919. As such, under his anglicized name, he would be King Robert I of England and King Robert IV of Scotland, although he never claimed these crowns and &quot;strongly discouraged&quot; anyone from claiming them on his behalf.

The changed political situation however allowed him finally to marry Princess Antonia of Luxembourg on 7 April 1921. The nuncio to Bavaria, Eugenio Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII, officiated at the ceremony.

Shortly after the 1922 Washington Naval Conference, he made a statement regarding the possible ban of aerial bombing, poison gas, sea blockades and long range guns, blaming them for a majority of civilian casualties during the last war. He also advocated Germany&#x27;s participation in future peace conferences, and he dismissed claims that Kaiser Wilhelm II was to blame for the First World War.

While opposed to the Weimar Republic and never having renounced his rights to the throne, Rupprecht envisaged a constitutional monarchy for Bavaria. Upon his father&#x27;s death in October 1921, Rupprecht declared his claim to the throne, since his father had never formally renounced his crown in the Anif declaration. While never crowned king, he did become the head of the House of Wittelsbach after his father&#x27;s death. He formed the &quot;Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfond&quot; in 1923, which was an agreement with the state of Bavaria, leaving the most important of the Wittelsbach palaces, like Neuschwanstein and Linderhof, to the Bavarian people. Afterwards, Rupprecht became critical of wars like World War I. Rupprecht once said to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Washington Naval Conference would be able to make future warfare more humane. Rupprecht added that future conferences would entirely abolish chemical warfare.

Rupprecht was never enticed to join the Nazis in Germany, despite Hitler&#x27;s attempts to win him over through Ernst Röhm and promises of royal restoration. The anti-Catholic stance of men like Erich Ludendorff might have been an influence. He helped persuade Gustav von Kahr to not support Hitler during the Beer Hall Putsch. Hitler confided in private to a personal dislike of the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince in turn confessed to King George V at a lunch in London in the summer of 1934 that he considered Hitler to be insane.
With the worsening of the Great Depression in 1932, a plan was floated to give Rupprecht dictatorial powers in Bavaria under the title of &quot;Staatskommissar&quot;. The plan attracted support from a wide coalition of parties, including the SPD and the post-war Bavarian &quot;Minister-President&quot; (First Minister) Wilhelm Hoegner but the legal appointment of Hitler as &quot;Reichskanzler&quot; in 1933 by Hindenburg and the hesitant Bavarian government under Heinrich Held ended all hopes for the idea.

Rupprecht continued to believe that restoration of the monarchy was possible, an opinion he voiced to the British ambassador Eric Phipps in 1935.

==Second World War==
Rupprecht was forced into exile in Italy in December 1939 (the last straw being the confiscation of &quot;Schloß Leutstetten&quot; by the Nazis) where he stayed as a guest of King Victor Emmanuel, residing mostly in Florence. He and his family were barred from returning to Germany. He continued to harbor the idea of the restoration of the Bavarian monarchy, in a possible union with Austria as an independent Southern Germany. In a memorandum in May 1943, he voiced his opinion that Germany would be completely defeated in the war and hoped to spare the German people from the worst when the Nazi regime finally fell. He even mentioned his ambition for the German crown, which had been held by the House of Wittelsbach in the past.

In October 1944, when Germany occupied Hungary, Rupprecht&#x27;s wife and children were captured, while he, still in Italy, evaded arrest. They were first imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Oranienburg, Brandenburg. In April 1945, they were moved to the Dachau concentration camp, where they were liberated by the United States Army. Antonia never recovered completely from the captivity, and died in 1954 in Switzerland, having vowed never to return to Germany after her ordeal. She was buried in Rome but her heart was, complying with Wittelsbach tradition, enshrined in the &quot;Gnadenkapelle&quot; (Chapel of the Miraculous Image) at Altötting.

==Post-war==

Rupprecht continued to advocate the restoration of the Bavarian monarchy upon his return but found no support from the US occupation authorities who, however, treated him courteously. General Dwight D. Eisenhower provided a special plane to fly him back to Munich in September 1945 and he returned to &quot;Schloß Leutstetten&quot;.

Of the 170 members of the Bavarian parliament, 70 declared themselves to be monarchists in September 1954, a clear sign of support for the Crown Prince.

==Death==
Upon his death in 1955 at Schloss Leutstetten at the age of 86, he was treated like a deceased monarch, receiving a state funeral. His life had spanned the independent Kingdom of Bavaria, the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, Allied-occupied Germany, and the establishment of West Germany and East Germany. He is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich near his grandfather Prince Luitpold and great-great-grandfather King Maximilian I, between his first wife Duchess Maria Gabrielle and his eldest son Prince Luitpold.

==Marriages and children==
Rupprecht married twice and had children with both of his wives. His first wife was Duchess Marie Gabriele in Bavaria (9 October 1878 – 24 October 1912), daughter of Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria, married on 10 July 1900 in Munich. They had five children:

<text>Alnilam is the central star of Orion&#x27;s Belt in the equatorial constellation of Orion. It has the Bayer designation ε Orionis, which is Latinised to Epsilon Orionis and abbreviated Epsilon Ori or ε Ori. This is a massive, blue supergiant star some 2,000 light-years distant. It is estimated to be 419,600 times as luminous as the Sun, and 40 times as massive.

==Observation==

It is the 29th-brightest star in the sky (the fourth brightest in Orion) and is a blue supergiant. Together with Mintaka and Alnitak, the three stars make up Orion&#x27;s Belt, known by many names across many ancient cultures. Alnilam is the middle star.

Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified, for the spectral class B0Ia. Although the spectrum shows variations, particular in the H-alpha absorption lines, this is considered typical for this type of luminous hot supergiant. It is also one of the 58 stars used in celestial navigation. It is at its highest point in the sky around midnight on December 15. 

It is slightly variable from magnitude 1.64 to 1.74, with no clear period, and it is classified as an α Cygni variable. Its spectrum also varies, possibly due to unpredictable changes in mass loss from the surface.

==Physical characteristics==

Estimates of Alnilam&#x27;s properties vary. Searle and colleagues, using CMFGEN code to analyse the spectrum in 2008, calculated a luminosity of , an effective temperature of 27,500 ± 100 K and a radius of . Analysis of the spectra and age of the members of the Orion OB1 association yields a mass 34.6 times that of the Sun ( on the main sequence) and an age of 5.7 million years. A more recent detailed analysis of Alnilam across multiple wavelength bands produced very high luminosity, radius, and mass estimates, assuming the distance of 606 parsecs suggested by the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; new reduction. Adopting the larger parallax from the original &quot;Hipparcos&quot; reduction gives a distance of 412 parsecs and physical parameters more consistent with earlier publications. The luminosity of and the mass of at 606 parsecs is the highest ever derived for this star. Using precalculated models, a 2020 study found smaller values for luminosity (), radius (), and mass (). Another spectroscopic distance modulus of 7.79 imply a distance of 361 parsecs.

Alnilam&#x27;s relatively simple spectrum has made it useful for studying the interstellar medium. Within the next million years, this star may turn into a Wolf-Rayet star and explode as a supernova. Alnilam&#x27;s high mass means that due to high mass loss, it will not become a red supergiant star, and will likely leave behind a black hole instead of a neutron star. It is surrounded by a molecular cloud, NGC 1990, which it illuminates to make a reflection nebula. Its stellar winds may reach up to 2,000 km/s, causing it to lose mass about 20 million times more rapidly than the Sun.

== Nomenclature and history ==
&quot;ε Orionis&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation and &quot;46 Orionis&quot; its Flamsteed designation.

The traditional name &quot;Alnilam&quot; derives from the Arabic النظام &quot;al-niẓām&quot; &#x27;arrangement/string (of pearls)&#x27;. Related spellings are &quot;Alnihan&quot; and &quot;Alnitam&quot;: all three variants are evidently mistakes in transliteration or copy errors, the first perhaps due to confusion with النيلم &quot;al-nilam&quot; &#x27;the sapphire&#x27;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Alnilam&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

===Orion&#x27;s Belt===

The three belt stars were collectively known by many names in many cultures. Arabic terms include &quot;Al Nijād&quot; (&#x27;the Belt&#x27;), &quot;Al Nasak&quot; (&#x27;the Line&#x27;), &quot;Al Alkāt&quot; (&#x27;the Golden Grains or Nuts&#x27;) and, in modern Arabic, &quot;Al Mīzān al H•akk&quot; (&#x27;the Accurate Scale Beam&#x27;). In Chinese mythology, they were also known as the Weighing Beam. 

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Three Stars (asterism)&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Alnilam, Alnitak and Mintaka (Orion&#x27;s Belt), with Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Saiph and Rigel later added. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alnilam is (, ). It is one of the western mansions of the White Tiger.

<text>Vigor Shipyards is the current entity operating the former Todd Shipyards after its acquisition in 2011. Todd Shipyards was founded in 1916, which owned and operated shipyards on the West Coast of the United States, East Coast of the United States and the Gulf. Todd Shipyards were a major part of the Emergency Shipbuilding Program for World War II.

==Vigor Shipyards==
In February 2011, Vigor Industrial purchased Todd for US$130 million. This included the Seattle, Everett and Bremerton operations. Today, Vigor Shipyards is a government repair subsidiary of Vigor Industrial.

Originally, the Coast Guard wanted to acquire 25 Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC) and spend about $8 billion for them. In April 2013, it was reported that Vigor proposed an Ulstein X-bow hull in the design competition for the OPC vessels. If successful in landing the contract, Vigor would have assembled the vessels at its Portland, Ore., shipyard. However, in February 2014, the USCG announced that Bollinger Shipyards, Eastern Shipbuilding, and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works had been awarded design contracts for the OPC.

In September 2017, Vigor was contracted to produce the US Army&#x27;s Maneuver Support Vessel (Light).

==Todd Shipyards ==

Todd Shipyards was founded in 1916 as the William H. Todd Corporation when properties of the Tietjen &amp; Lang Dry Dock Company of Hoboken, New Jersey were bought in 1916 by a syndicate headed by Bertron Griscom &amp; Company of New York and placed under management of William H. Todd, president of the Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., Erie Basin, Brooklyn, New York. That acquisition was followed by acquisition of the Tebo Yacht Basin, Brooklyn, and the Seattle Construction and Dry Dock Company.

The Seattle shipyard traces its history back to 1882, when Robert Moran opened a marine repair shop at Yesler&#x27;s Wharf. This shop became the Moran Brothers Shipyard in 1906 and the Seattle Construction &amp; Dry Dock Company at the end of 1911.

The shipyard has performed building and maintenance work for, among others, the U.S. and Royal Australian Navies, the United States Coast Guard, and the Washington State Ferries. Its headquarters and operations are on Harbor Island at the mouth of Seattle&#x27;s Duwamish Waterway. Todd ranked 26th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.

The hull of Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Mark Twain&quot; riverboat was built at Todd Shipyards in San Pedro, California, in 1955. Frank Sinatra worked after high school as a rivet catcher at Todd Shipyard in Hoboken, New Jersey. From 1940 to 1945, during World War II, Todd Shipyards built or repaired 23,000 ships in many shipyards with 57,000 workers. Todd Shipyards came out of Chapter 11 protection in 1991, and continues shipyard on the west coast. In 1995 Todd branched out and started a radio subsidiary company called Elettra Broadcasting Corporation. Elettra Broadcasting operated three FM radio stations in Carmel.

<doc id="545907" wikidata="Q3056906" url="?curid=545907" title="Ernest Cormier">
<text>Ernest Cormier (December 5, 1885 – January 1, 1980) was a Canadian engineer and architect. He spent much of his career in the Montreal area, designing notable examples of Art Deco architecture, including the Université de Montréal original main building, the Supreme Court of Canada Building in Ottawa, and the Cormier House (his home in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile).

==Life and career==
Cormier was born in Montreal, the son of a medical doctor, and he studied civil engineering at the École Polytechnique in Montreal. After graduation in 1906, he worked in the research department of the Dominion Bridge Company in Montreal.

In 1909, he studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, in the atelier of Jean-Louis Pascal. In 1914, he was the recipient of the Henry Jarvis Scholarship, awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects. Through its British &quot;Prix de Rome&quot;, Cormier spent two years in Rome, where he studied the ancient works. Following his return to Paris in January 1917, he was employed by the engineering firm of Considère, Pelnard et Caquot, specialists in concrete, and he graduated as an architect of the French Government (DPLG).

He was a professor at the École Polytechnique in Montreal from 1921 to 1954. After his death in 1980, he was interred in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

==Major works==

===Université de Montréal – Roger Gaudry Building===
Cormier&#x27;s major work is the central building of the Université de Montréal (now known as the Roger Gaudry Building) on the north slope of Mount Royal. This huge example of the Art Deco style was built between World War I and the middle of World War II, and it has been kept in a nearly pristine shape over the decades. It is a composition of simple forms of planes and surfaces in successive relief, emphasizing vertical lines. The light buff vitrified brick has trimmings of Missisquoi marble. The only major destruction of his designs took place within the interior spaces. These changes occurred in the 1970s, when the great multi-storey hall of the central library was filled up with several smaller, single-storey rooms for the faculty of medicine and its library.

===Université Laval – Casault pavilion===
Another important example of Cormier&#x27;s work can be found on another Quebec university campus, the of Université Laval (named after the first rector of the university), familiarly known by students as the &#x27;Louis-Jacques&#x27;. The design was originally started by the Benedictine architect monk Dom Bellot but completed by Cormier after Dom Bellot&#x27;s death. Plans were laid out in 1948 but only completed in 1960, it is a massive cathedral-like building, originally designed as Quebec City&#x27;s &quot;Grand Séminaire&quot;, which is particularly spectacular viewed from a distance along the impressive mall that runs along the east–west axis of the campus grounds. Despite an unfortunate renovation scheme in the 1970s, which gutted the chapel, filled in the magnificent enclosed courtyard and transformed the interior into an undecipherable labyrinth, the building has become the most recognized landmark of the second-oldest university in North America and home to Laval&#x27;s faculties of Music and Communications, as well as to Quebec&#x27;s National Archives (in the former church).

===Rhode Island churches===
Cormier also designed two important Roman Catholic Churches for the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, USA. One of them, St. John the Baptist Church of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. His other work as Notre Dame du Sacre Coeur, 666 Broad Street in Central Falls.

===Cormier House===
Cormier&#x27;s own home, on Montreal&#x27;s Pine Avenue, is one of the finest examples of an Art Deco dwelling in the world. Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau purchased the building in 1979, and he lived there following his retirement until his death in 2000.

===Supreme Court of Canada Building===
Cormier is also responsible for the classic château-style Supreme Court of Canada Building (1939–40) in Ottawa.

===Other commissions===
He was a design consultant for the United Nations building in New York City. In Toronto, Cormier designed St. Michael&#x27;s College School (1950) and Carr Hall at St. Michael&#x27;s College (University of Toronto, 1954).

==Style and legacy==
In addition to showing great balance between the disciplines of engineering and architecture in most of his buildings, Cormier also had great skills as a painter and illustrator. He left many renderings of his works, done in the planning stages.

In 1974, Cormier was inducted into the Order of Canada by Governor General Jules Léger, and he received numerous honours and awards. The Édifice Ernest-Cormier (which he co-designed), the Quebec Court of Appeal building in Old Montreal, is named in his honour.

In 2018, Cormier was named a National Historic Person, and the Ernest Cormier House and the Roger Gaudry Building (at the Université de Montréal) were designated National Historic Sites.

<text>Kinesiology () is the scientific study of human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, anatomical, biomechanical, pathological, neuropsychological principles and mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health include biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; motor control; skill acquisition and motor learning; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise physiology. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.

== Basics ==
Kinesiology studies the science of human movement, performance, and function by applying the fundamental sciences of cell biology, molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, biomechanics, biomathematics, biostatistics, anatomy, physiology, exercise physiology, pathophysiology, neuroscience, and nutritional science. A bachelor&#x27;s degree in kinesiology can provide strong preparation for graduate study in medical school, biomedical research, as well as in professional programs.

The term &quot;kinesiologist&quot; is not a licensed nor professional designation in many countries, with the notable exception of Canada. Individuals with training in this area can teach physical education, work as personal trainers and sports coaches, provide consulting services, conduct research and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, ergonomics, and occupational health and safety. In North America, kinesiologists may study to earn a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, or Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Kinesiology or a Bachelor of Kinesiology degree, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher). Many doctoral-level faculty in North American kinesiology programs received their doctoral training in related disciplines, such as neuroscience, mechanical engineering, psychology, and physiology.

In 1965, the University of Massachusetts Amherst created the United States&#x27; first Department of Exercise Science (kinesiology) under the leadership of visionary researchers and academicians in the field of exercise science. In 1967, the University of Waterloo launched Canada&#x27;s first kinesiology department.

== Principles ==

=== Adaptation through exercise ===
Adaptation through exercise is a key principle of kinesiology that relates to improved fitness in athletes as well as health and wellness in clinical populations. Exercise is a simple and established intervention for many movement disorders and musculoskeletal conditions due to the neuroplasticity of the brain and the adaptability of the musculoskeletal system. Therapeutic exercise has been shown to improve neuromotor control and motor capabilities in both normal and pathological populations.

There are many different types of exercise interventions that can be applied in kinesiology to athletic, normal, and clinical populations. Aerobic exercise interventions help to improve cardiovascular endurance. Anaerobic strength training programs can increase muscular strength, power, and lean body mass. Decreased risk of falls and increased neuromuscular control can be attributed to balance intervention programs. Flexibility programs can increase functional range of motion and reduce the risk of injury.

As a whole, exercise programs can reduce symptoms of depression and risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Additionally, they can help to improve quality of life, sleeping habits, immune system function, and body composition.

The study of the physiological responses to physical exercise and their therapeutic applications is known as exercise physiology, which is an important area of research within kinesiology.

=== Neuroplasticity ===

Neuroplasticity is also a key scientific principle used in kinesiology to describe how movement and changes in the brain are related. The human brain adapts and acquires new motor skills based on this principle. The brain can be exposed to new stimuli and experiences and therefore learn from them and create new neural pathways hence leading to brain adaptation. These new adaptations and skills include both adaptive and maladaptive brain changes.

Adaptive plasticity

Recent empirical evidence indicates the significant impact of physical activity on brain function; for example, greater amounts of physical activity are associated with enhanced cognitive function in older adults. The effects of physical activity can be distributed throughout the whole brain, such as higher gray matter density and white matter integrity after exercise training, and/or on specific brain areas, such as greater activation in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Neuroplasticity is also the underlying mechanism of skill acquisition. For example, after long-term training, pianists showed greater gray matter density in sensorimotor cortex and white matter integrity in the internal capsule compared to non-musicians.

Maladaptive plasticity

Maladaptive plasticity is defined as neuroplasticity with negative effects or detrimental consequences in behavior. Movement abnormalities may occur among individuals with and without brain injuries due to abnormal remodeling in central nervous system. Learned non-use is an example commonly seen among patients with brain damage, such as stroke. Patients with stroke learned to suppress paretic limb movement after unsuccessful experience in paretic hand use; this may cause decreased neuronal activation at adjacent areas of the infarcted motor cortex.

There are many types of therapies that are designed to overcome maladaptive plasticity in clinic and research, such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), body weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) and virtual reality therapy. These interventions are shown to enhance motor function in paretic limbs and stimulate cortical reorganization in patients with brain damage.

=== Motor redundancy ===
Motor redundancy is a widely used concept in kinesiology and motor control which states that, for any task the human body can perform, there are effectively an unlimited number of ways the nervous system could achieve that task. This redundancy appears at multiple levels in the chain of motor execution:

* Kinematic redundancy means that for a desired location of the endpoint (e.g. the hand or finger), there are many configurations of the joints that would produce the same endpoint location in space.
* Muscle redundancy means that the same net joint torque could be generated by many different relative contributions of individual muscles.
* Motor unit redundancy means that for the same net muscle force could be generated by many different relative contributions of motor units within that muscle.

The concept of motor redundancy is explored in numerous studies, usually with the goal of describing the relative contribution of a set of motor elements (e.g. muscles) in various human movements, and how these contributions can be predicted from a comprehensive theory. Two distinct (but not incompatible) theories have emerged for how the nervous system coordinates redundant elements: simplification and optimization. In the simplification theory, complex movements and muscle actions are constructed from simpler ones, often known as primitives or synergies, resulting in a simpler system for the brain to control. In the optimization theory, motor actions arise from the minimization of a control parameter, such as the energetic cost of movement or errors in movement performance.

== Scope of practice ==
In Canada, kinesiology is a professional designation as well as an area of study. In the province of Ontario the scope has been officially defined as, &quot;the assessment of human movement and performance and its rehabilitation and management to maintain, rehabilitate or enhance movement and performance&quot;

Kinesiologists work in a variety of roles as health professionals. They work as rehabilitation providers in hospitals, clinics and private settings working with populations needing care for musculoskeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions. They provide rehabilitation to persons injured at work and in vehicular accidents. Kinesiologists also work as functional assessment specialists, exercise therapists, ergonomists, return to work specialists, case managers and medical legal evaluators. They can be found in hospital, long-term care, clinic, work, and community settings. Additionally, kinesiology is applied in areas of health and fitness for all levels of athletes, but more often found with training of elite athletes.

== Licensing and regulation ==
=== Canada ===
In Canada, kinesiology has been designated a regulated health profession in Ontario. Kinesiology was granted the right to regulate in the province of Ontario in the summer of 2007 and similar proposals have been made for other provinces. The College of Kinesiologists of Ontario achieved proclamation on April 1, 2013, at which time the professional title &quot;Kinesiologist&quot; became protected by law. In Ontario only members of the college may call themselves a Registered Kinesiologist. Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments. They also work in cardiac rehabilitation, health and safety, hospital and long-term care facilities and community health centers just to name a few.

== Health service ==
* Health promotion
: Kinesiologists working in the health promotion industry work with individuals to enhance the health, fitness, and well-being of the individual. Kinesiologists can be found working in fitness facilities, personal training/corporate wellness facilities, and industry.
* Clinical/rehabilitation
: Kinesiologists work with individuals with disabling conditions to assist in regaining their optimal physical function. They work with individuals in their home, fitness facilities, rehabilitation clinics, and at the worksite. They also work alongside physiotherapists and occupational therapists.
* Ergonomics
: Kinesiologists work in industry to assess suitability of design of workstations and provide suggestions for modifications and assistive devices.
* Health and safety
: Kinesiologists are involved in consulting with industry to identify hazards and provide recommendations and solutions to optimize the health and safety of workers.
* Disability management/case coordination
: Kinesiologists recommend and provide a plan of action to return an injured individual to their optimal function in all aspects of life.
* Management/research/administration
: Kinesiologists frequently fulfill roles in all above areas, perform research, and manage businesses.
* Health education
: Kinesiologists working in health education teach people about behaviors that promote wellness. They develop and implement strategies to improve the health of individuals and communities. Community health workers collect data and discuss health concerns with members of specific populations or communities.
* Athletic coaches and scouts
: Kinesiologists who pursue a career as an athletic coach develop new talent and guide an athlete&#x27;s progress in a specific sport. They teach amateur or professional athletes the skills they need to succeed at their sport. Many coaches are also involved in scouting. Scouts look for new players and evaluate their skills and likelihood for success at the college, amateur, or professional level.
* Physical education teacher
: Kinesiologists working as physical education teachers are responsible for teaching fitness, sports and health. They help students stay both mentally and physically fit by teaching them to make healthy choices.
:* Physical therapy
:Kinesiologists working in physical therapy diagnose physical abnormalities, restore mobility to the client, and promote proper function of joints.

== History of kinesiology ==
Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics (sv) G.C.I. was founded 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden by Pehr Henrik Ling. It was the first Physiotherapy school in the world, training hundreds of medical gymnasts who spread the Swedish physical therapy around the entire world.
In 1887, Sweden was the first country in the world to give a national state licence to physiotherapists/physical therapists.

The Swedish medical gymnast and kinesiologist Carl August Georgii (sv), Professor at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute GCI in Stockholm, was the one who created and coined the new international word Kinesiology in 1854.&lt;br&gt;
The term &quot;Kinesiology&quot; is a literal translation to Greek+English from the original Swedish word &quot;Rörelselära&quot;, meaning &quot;Movement Science&quot;. It was the foundation of the Medical Gymnastics, the original Physiotherapy and Physical Therapy, developed for over 100 years in Sweden (starting 1813).

The new medical therapy created in Sweden was originally called Rörelselära (sv), and later in 1854 translated to the new and invented international word &quot;Kinesiology&quot;. The Kinesiology consisted of nearly 2,000 physical movements and 50 different types of massage therapy techniques.
They were all used to affect various dysfunctions and even illnesses, not only in the movement apparatus, but also into the internal physiology of man.
Thus, the original classical and Traditional Kinesiology was not only a system of rehabilitation for the body, or biomechanics like in modern Academic Kinesiology, but also a new therapy for relieving and curing diseases, by affecting the autonomic nervous system, organs and glands in the body.,

In 1886, the Swedish Medical Gymnast Nils Posse (1862–1895) introduced the term kinesiology in the U.S. Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium in Boston, MA. He was teaching at Boston Normal School of Gymnastics BNSG.
&quot;The Special Kinesiology Of Educational Gymnastics&quot; was the first book ever written in the world with the word &quot;Kinesiology&quot; in the title of the book. It was written by Nils Posse and published in Boston, 1894–1895. Posse was elected posthumously as an Honorary Fellow in Memoriam in the National Academy of Kinesiology.

The National Academy of Kinesiology was formally founded in 1930 in the United States. The academy&#x27;s dual purpose is to encourage and promote the study and educational applications of the art and science of human movement and physical activity and to honor by election to its membership persons who have directly or indirectly contributed significantly to the study of and/or application of the art and science of human movement and physical activity. Membership in the National Academy of Kinesiology is by election and those elected are known as Fellows. Fellows are elected from around the world. Election into the National Academy of Kinesiology is considered a pinnacle achievement and recognition with the discipline.

== Technology in kinesiology ==
Motion capture technology has application in measuring human movement, and thus kinesiology. Historically, motion capture labs have recorded high fidelity data. While accurate and credible, these systems can come at high capital and operational costs. Modern-day systems have increased accessibility to mocap technology.

== Adapted physical activity ==
Adapted physical activity (APA) is a branch of kinesiology, referring to physical activity that is modified or designed to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities. The term originated in the field of physical education and is commonly used in the field of physical education and rehabilitation to refer to physical activities and exercises that have been modified or adapted for individuals with disabilities. These activities are often led by trained professionals, such as adapted physical educators, occupational therapists, or physical therapists.

In 1973 the Federation Internationale de lʼ Activite Physique Adaptee (International Federation of Adapted Physical Activity - IFAPA) was formed and is described as a discipline/profession that purpose to facilitates physical activity across people with a wide range of individual differences, emphasizing in empowerment, self-determination and opportunities access.

A common definition of APA is &quot;a cross-disciplinary body of practical and theoretical knowledge directed toward impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions in physical activity. It is a service delivery profession and an academic field of study that supports an attitude of acceptance of individual differences, advocates access to active lifestyles and sport, and promotes innovative and cooperative service delivery, supports, and empowerment. Adapted physical activity includes, but is not limited to, physical education, sport, recreation, dance, creative arts, nutrition, medicine, and rehabilitation.&quot; This definition aligns with the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health whereby disability is seen as the interaction between impairments or conditions with activity limitations, participation restrictions and contextual factors.

===Overview===
The term APA has evolved in the course of years, and in some countries could be recognized with alternative terms that contain a similar set of constructs, for example, sports for disabled people, sports therapy, and psychomotor therapy. The APA is considered as (i) activities or service delivery, (ii) a profession, and (iii) an academic field of study with a unique body of knowledge that differs from terms such as adapted physical education or para-sport. Principally, APA is an umbrella term that incorporates the mentioned terms considered sub-specializations (i.e., physical education, para-sports, recreation, and rehabilitation).
APA is proposed to have close links between the field of practice and the field of study with unique theories and growing bodies of practical and scientific knowledge, where APA practitioners are those who provide the services and activities, while APA scholars generate and promote evidence-based research practices among practitioners.

Adaptation to physical activity opportunities is most often provided in the form of appropriately designed and modified equipment (prosthesis, wheelchairs, mono-ski, ball size), task criteria (e.g., modifying skill quality criteria or using a different skill), instructions (e.g., using personal supports, peer tutors, non-verbal instructions, motivational strategies), physical and social environments (e.g., increasing or decreasing court dimensions; segregated vs. inclusive; type of training climate: mastery-oriented, collaborative or competitive social environment; degree of peer and parental support), and rules (e.g., double bounce rule in wheelchair tennis).
In general, the APA presents various sub-specializations such as physical education (e.g., inclusion in physical education, attention to students with special needs, development of new education contents), sports (e.g., development of paralympic sports, activity by sports federations for athletes with disabilities), recreation (e.g., development of the inclusive sport approach and attitudes change programs), and rehabilitation (e.g., physical activity programs in rehabilitation centers, involvement of health-related professionals).

The role of sports and physical activity participation in the population with disabilities has been recognized as a human right in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and declared in other international organization agreements such as:
* International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport (UNESCO).
* International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport (MINEPS).
* Marseille Declaration, Universal Fitness Innovation &amp; Transformation - UFIT Launch October 2015. A Commitment to Inclusion by and for the Global Fitness Industry.
* Sustainable Development Goals, Sports and Physical Activity, United Nations (UN).
In this line, the APA as a discipline/profession plays an essential role in addressing the needs from a theoretical and practical framework to provide full participation access in physical activity to populations with disabilities.

There are many educational programmes offered around the world that specialise in APA, including disability sports, adapted sports, rehabilitation, adapted physical education and parasport management. In Europe there is the European Diploma of Adapted Physical Activity for bachelor&#x27;s degrees. At the master&#x27;s degree level, there is the International Masters in Adapted Physical Activity and the master&#x27;s degree in Adapted Physical Activity offered by the Lithuanian Sports University. A doctoral programme in adapted physical activity can be studied through the Multi-Institution Mentorship Consortium (MAMC). Furthermore, there is offered a Master of Adapted Physical Education in the North American region in Oregon State University (USA). In the South American Region, the San Sebastian University (Chile) offers a Master of Physical Activity and Adapted Sports. The universities Viña del Mar and UMCE in Chile offers a specialization in adapted physical activity.

=== International Federation of Adapted Physical Activity ===
The International Federation of Adapted Physical Activity (IFAPA) is an international scientific organization of higher education scholars, practitioners and students dedicated to promoting APA. IFAPA was founded in 1973 in Quebec, Canada, presenting an original purpose declared &quot;to give global focus to professionals who use adapted physical activities for instruction, recreation, remediation, and research&quot;. From these initial times, IFAPA evolved from a small organization to an international corporation with active regional federations in different world regions.

The current purpose of IFAPA are:
* To encourage international cooperation in the field of physical activity to the benefit of individuals of all abilities,
* to promote, stimulate and support research in the field of adapted physical activity throughout the world,
* and to make scientific knowledge of and practical experiences in adapted physical activity available to all interested persons, organizations and institutions.
IFAPA coordinates national, regional, and international functions (both governmental and nongovernmental) that pertain to sport, dance, aquatics, exercise, fitness, and wellness for individuals of all ages with disabilities or special needs. IFAPA is linked with several other international governing bodies, including the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), Special Olympics International and the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education (ICSSPE). English is the language used for IFAPA correspondence, conferences. Professor David Legg from Mount Royal University is the current president of the International Federation of Adapted Physical Activity (IFAPA) since 2019 at the International Symposium of Adapted Physical Activity (ISAPA) hosted by IFAPA Past President Martin Block at the University of Virginia. 
The biennial ISAPA scheduled for 2021 was planned to be held at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was later announced to be held online only, making it the first Online ISAPA since the first one in 1977. The 2023 ISAPA was awarded to a multi-site organisation by Halberg Foundation in New Zealand and Mooven in France.

=== Research and dissemination in adapted physical activity ===
Actually, it is possible to find numerous sports science journals with research papers on adapted sport, while those specific to APA are lesser. Adapted Physical Activity Quarterly (APAQ) is the only AFA-specific journal indexed in the Journal Citation Reports Index, appearing in both the Sport Sciences and Rehabilitation directories, which is another example of its interdisciplinarity (Impact Score 2020-2021 = 2.61) (Pérez et al., 2012). Additionally, the European Journal of Adapted Physical Activity (EUJAPA) is another international, multidisciplinary journal introduced to communicate, share and stimulate academic inquiry focusing on APA of persons with disabilities, appearing in the Education directories of Scimago Journal &amp; Country Rank (SJR).
Regarding the dissemination of scientific knowledge generated by the APA, the most relevant international events are described as follows:
* International Symposium of Adapted Physical Activity (ISAPA), organized by IFAPA on a biannual basis.
* Vista conference, organized by the International Paralympic Committee on a biannual basis.
* Paralympic Congress, organized by the International Paralympic Committee every four years.
* European Conference on Adapted Physical Activity (EUCAPA), organized by European Federation in Adapted Physical Activity on a biannual basis.
* North American Federation of Adapted Physical Activity (NAFAPA) Conference, organized by NAFAPA on a biannual basis.
* South American Adapted Physical Activity Conference, organized by South American Federation of Adapted Physical Activity.

=== Adapted physical education ===

Adapted physical education is a sub-discipline of physical education with a focus on including students with disabilities into the subject. APE is the term used to refer to the physical education for individuals with disabilities that occurs primarily in elementary and secondary schools. According to Dunn and Leitschuh APE is defined as &quot;Adapted physical education programs are those that have the same objectives as the regular physical education program but in which adjustments are made in the regular offerings to meet the needs and abilities of exceptional students&quot;. This education can be provided in separate educational settings as well as in general (regular) educational settings. APE is oriented to educate students to lifelong engagement in physical activities and to live a healthy lifestyle offering possibilities to exploit movements, games, and sports and at the same time personal development.
Goals and objectives of adapted and general physical education might be the same with some minor differences. For example, learning to push a wheelchair or play wheelchair basketball might be a goal for a child with a spinal cord injury, while running and playing regular basketball is a goal for a child with a disability. In other cases, a child with a disability might focus on fewer objectives or modified objectives within a domain (e.g., physical fitness) compared to peers without disabilities.

=== Parasport or disability sport ===

The APA in this field is oriented principally to the Parasports movement, which organises sports for and by people with disabilities. Examples of para-sports organizations include sports in the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics, Deaflympics as well as Invictus games to name a few. Many para-sports have eligibility criteria according to the characteristics of the participants. In the Paralympics Games, this is known as sport classification, a system that provides a framework for determining who can and who cannot participate according to the impact of the impairments on the outcome of the competition.

In the Special Olympics individuals eligible have to meet the following criteria
* be at least 8 years old
* have been identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays (as measured by formal assessment), or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require specially designed instruction.
Another sporting competition for people with intellectual impairments is the Virtus Games (formerly known as International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability. This is different from the Special Olympics. Eligibility is based on a master list of
* II 1 Intellectual Disability
* II 2 Significant Intellectual Disability
* II 3 Austism
To be eligible to compete at the Deaflympics, athletes must have a hearing loss of at least 55 decibels in the better ear.
The Invictus Games were designed to allow sport competitions between wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women (WIS). Therefore, only people in the military sectors can compete in the Invictus games.

=== Physical medicine and rehabiltiation ===
The results from APA can help the practice of Physical medicine and rehabilitation, whereby the functional ability and quality of life is improved. Rehabilitation is helping the individual achieve the highest level of functioning, independence, participation, and quality of life possible. The APA and sport in rehabilitation for individuals with disabilities is particularly important and is associated with the legacy of the medical rehabilitation specialist Sir Ludwig Guttman who was the founder of the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation, the basis of the actual Paralympic movement. APA and sports are strongly recommended in rehabilitation programs due to the positive impact and health benefits in people with different disabilities. The APA practitioner provides exercise and training regimens adapted for specific individual needs and works based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health of the World Health Organization, facilitating a common language with other rehabilitation professionals during the rehabilitation process.

<text>The Federal Music Project (FMP) was a part of the New Deal program Federal Project Number One provided by the U.S. federal government which employed musicians, conductors and composers during the Great Depression. In addition to performing thousands of concerts, offering music classes, organizing the Composers Forum Laboratory, hosting music festivals and creating 34 new orchestras, employees of the FMP researched American traditional music and folk songs, a practice now called ethnomusicology. In the latter domain the Federal Music Project did notable studies on cowboy, Creole, and what was then termed Negro music. During the Great Depression, many people visited these symphonies to forget about the economic hardship of the time. In 1939, the FMP transitioned to the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Music Program, which along with many other WPA projects, was phased out in the midst of World War II.

==Background==
In the grips of the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed to sharply increase public projects in order to raise employment. This overarching strategy was known as the New Deal. Roosevelt realized the importance of the arts in American culture, stating that the &quot;American Dream… was the promise not only of economic and social justice but also of cultural enrichment.&quot; In July 1935 a New Deal program known as Federal One was created. This included five arts projects, including the FMP. This project was the first where Federal money was used on culture.

The Depression had compounded a downturn in the fortunes of American musicians. At the same time musicians were also being affected by advances in technology. Sound recordings were beginning to replace live musicians at functions and events.

==Leadership==
Dr. Nikolai Sokoloff was the director of the Federal Music Project. Before the Federal Music Project, Dr. Sokoloff was the conductor for the original Cleveland Orchestra from 1919-1933. Sokoloff appointed a staff of five Regional Directors, twenty three State Directors, and five administrative staff.
In 1936, the Works Progress Administration also began to add on to the Federal Music Project. The WPA&#x27;s didn&#x27;t center towards original music. The next year Charles Seeger developed into assistant director of the project. After he became assistant director, many varieties of music became available. Seeger&#x27;s ambition was for everyone to take an interest in music, and become a part of it.

==Objectives==
The primary objective of the FMP was to employ professional musicians from all over the country to perform as instrumentalists, singers, and concert actors. As a result of the growing number of performing groups, there was also a need for music copyists and binders. Men and women were hired to copy existing music by hand and then to bind them, distributing musical arrangements to ensembles around the nation. The Project also aimed to inspire music appreciation by enabling access to live performances and by introducing music instruction in the classroom. Finally, the FMP sought to document musical activity in the United States.

Even though the project was thought to be this picturesque, ideal, and perfect plan, there were still many challenging facets that occurred during its time. One of the more general obstacles the Federal Music Project had to go through was the types of culture going into the project. Sokoloff was predisposed to European classical music, and made that the focus of the FMP. There was a much lower priority placed on vernacular or American folk music. These Eurocentric tastes were in contrast to the &quot;common man&quot; ideology of the New Deal.
Despite this national focus on classical music, regional and local implementations of the FMP revealed the diverse musical genres in early 20th century America. Live performances of African American and Hispanic music drew attention, as did efforts in several states to document musical traditions from ethnic minorities, spirituals, work songs and other folk music.

==State-level implementation==

The Federal Music Program was particularly successful in New Mexico. Helen Chandler Ryan served as the FMP state music director from January 1936 until the project&#x27;s end in 1943. She adapted the national program to meet the special musical interests of her sparsely populated state. She decided to devote much of the program to solo instruction in rural communities. Another concentration was the study of the diverse regional musical style created by blending European, Native American and Spanish American music. New Mexico&#x27;s implementation of the Federal Music Program received praise for its diversity.

==Project successes==
The Federal Music Project created lessons for adults who were underprivileged, and it created a musical program for children. The creation of music was more popular, and the appreciation for music arose. The amateur musicians became better, and there were more musical participants. The project formed new orchestras, singers, dancers, vocal groups, and vocal producers. The music project supplied performers and teachers of music an occupation. It also created many new orchestral pieces of music. The project caught on so much in the 1930s that most schools had their own music program.
In addition, it created something for people to do during the hardships. These musical concerts were either a very low cost, or they were free, allowing many who could otherwise not afford such luxury to attend.

==Decline and termination==
In 1939, the Federal Music Project&#x27;s budget was cut. This was followed by the decline in finances for other New Deal programs as well; many other projects like the Federal Music Project saw their funding reduced. Congressional support deteriorated in the late 1930s, and the budget bill passed in June 1939 reflected the reduced support. Sokoloff had resigned the previous month amid debate over his preference toward classical music. And in 1939 the Federal Music Project was renamed. Its new name was the WPA Music Program. Though a year later the Federal Music Project/WPA Music Program would be terminated. State music projects came to an end with the ending of the WPA on June 30, 1943.

<text>Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a valvular heart disease characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest.

The diagnosis of MVP primarily relies on echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to visualize the mitral valve.

MVP is the most common valvular abnormality, and is estimated to affect 2–3% of the population and 1 in 40 people might have it.

The condition was first described by John Brereton Barlow in 1966. It was subsequently termed &quot;mitral valve prolapse&quot; by J. Michael Criley. Although mid-systolic click (the sound produced by the prolapsing mitral leaflet) and systolic murmur associated with MVP were observed as early as 1887 by physicians M. Cuffer and M. Barbillon using a stethoscope.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Murmur===
Upon auscultation of an individual with mitral valve prolapse, a mid-systolic click, followed by a late systolic murmur heard best at the apex, is common. The length of the murmur signifies the time period over which blood is leaking back into the left atrium, known as regurgitation. A murmur that lasts throughout the whole of systole is known as a holo-systolic murmur. A murmur that is mid to late systolic, although typically associated with less regurgitation, can still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences.

In contrast to most other heart murmurs, the murmur of mitral valve prolapse is accentuated by standing and Valsalva maneuver (earlier systolic click and longer murmur) and diminished with squatting (later systolic click and shorter murmur). The only other heart murmur that follows this pattern is the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An MVP murmur can be distinguished from a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy murmur by the presence of a mid-systolic click which is virtually diagnostic of MVP. The handgrip maneuver diminishes the murmur of an MVP and the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The handgrip maneuver also diminishes the duration of the murmur and delays the timing of the mid-systolic click.

Both Valsalva maneuver and standing decrease venous return to the heart thereby decreasing left ventricular diastolic filling (preload) and causing more laxity on the chordae tendineae. This allows the mitral valve to prolapse earlier in systole, leading to an earlier systolic click (i.e. closer to S1), and a longer murmur.

===Mitral valve prolapse syndrome===
Historically, the term mitral valve prolapse syndrome has been applied to MVP associated with palpitations, atypical precordial pain, dyspnea on exertion, low body mass index, and electrocardiogram abnormalities (ventricular tachycardia), syncope, low blood pressure, headaches, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, gastrointestinal disturbances, cold extremities and other signs suggestive of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia).

===Mitral regurgitation===
Mitral valve prolapse is frequently associated with mild mitral regurgitation, where blood aberrantly flows from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole. In the United States, MVP is the most common cause of severe, non-ischemic mitral regurgitation. This is occasionally due to rupture of the chordae tendineae that support the mitral valve.

The severity of regurgitation in MVP is typically estimated using a grading system:

* 0 (none or trivial)
* Grade 1 (mild)
* Grade 2 (moderate)
* Grade 3 (moderate to severe)
* Grade 4 (severe)

=== Cardiac arrhythmia ===
People with mitral valve prolapse might have arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse which includes higher incidence of ventricular contraction disorders and tachycardia compared to the normal population, although the relationship between both phenomena is not entirely clear. Prolapse of both mitral leaflets and the presence of mitral regurgitation further increases the risk of severe ventricular arrhythmias during exertion, which may not be resolved with surgery. The most common rhythm disorder is ventricular extrasystole, followed by paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.

=== Sudden cardiac death ===
Severe mitral valve prolapse and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction is associated with arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation that can progress to cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Because there is no evidence that prolapse has contributed to these arrhythmias, these complications may be due to mitral regurgitation or congestive heart failure. The incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the general population with MVP remain low. Sudden cardiac death results in 0.2% to 0.4% patients per year.

==Risk factors==
MVP can be non-syndromic, isolated, familial and syndromic. The syndromic variant may occur with greater frequency in individuals with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Loeys–Dietz syndrome, Williams–Beuren syndrome or polycystic kidney disease. Other risk factors include Graves&#x27; disease and chest wall deformities such as pectus excavatum. For unknown reasons, MVP patients tend to have a low body mass index (BMI) and are typically leaner than individuals without MVP. Also women tend to have joint hypermobility.

Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. Chronic rheumatic heart disease is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. The recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved. Rheumatic fever, since the advent of routine penicillin administration for Strep throat, has become less common in developed countries. In the older generation and in much of the less-developed world, valvular disease (including mitral valve prolapse, reinfection in the form of valvular endocarditis, and valve rupture) from undertreated rheumatic fever continues to be a problem.

In an Indian hospital between 2004 and 2005, 4 of 24 endocarditis patients failed to demonstrate classic vegetations. All had rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and presented with prolonged fever. All had severe eccentric mitral regurgitation (MR). (One had severe aortic regurgitation (AR) also.) One had flail posterior mitral leaflet (PML).
The mitral valve, so named because of its resemblance to a bishop&#x27;s mitre, is the heart valve that prevents the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium of the heart. It is composed of two leaflets, one anterior and one posterior, that close when the left ventricle contracts.

Each leaflet is composed of three layers of tissue: the &quot;atrialis&quot;, &quot;fibrosa&quot;, and &quot;spongiosa&quot;. Patients with classic mitral valve prolapse have excess connective tissue that thickens the spongiosa and separates collagen bundles in the fibrosa. This is due to an excess of dermatan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan. This weakens the leaflets and adjacent tissue, resulting in increased leaflet area and elongation of the chordae tendineae. Elongation of the chordae tendineae often causes rupture, commonly to the chordae attached to the posterior leaflet. Advanced lesions—also commonly involving the posterior leaflet—lead to leaflet folding, inversion, and displacement toward the left atrium.

=== In diagnostics ===
Common risk factors in diagnostics for severe, arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse include:
* Electrocardiography - Inferior T wave inversions in II, III, aVF leads, ST-segment depression, QT dispersion, QT prolongation, complex ventricular ectopy (PVCs), PVC-triggered ventricular fibrillation
* Echocardiography - moderate mitral regurgitation, leaflet thickening, bi-leaflet MVP with redundancy, spiked systolic high-velocity signal (pickelhaube spike) when ≥ 16 cm/s in mitral annular tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), mitral annular disjunction (MAD)
* Cardiac MRI - myocardial/papillary scars (fibrosis), myocardial stretch, systolic curling

== Histopathology ==
MVP is understood histologically, as a form of myxomatous degeneration, which is a type of connective tissue changes.

In MVP, the spongiosa layer of the mitral valve leaflets undergoes proliferation, and the cells in this layer multiply and expand. This proliferation is associated with the accumulation of deposits of mucopolysaccharide, which have a high water content, which leads to an increase in the thickness and redundancy (excess tissue) of the leaflets of the mitral valve.

Also in people with MVP, there is an increase in the content of type III collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to tissues. At the same time, the elastin fibers, which provide elasticity to the tissues, become fragmented. This combination of changes contributes to the overall structural alterations observed in MVP.

== Causes ==

=== Genetics ===
Mitral valve prolapse is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal dominant trait, which can be passed down from one parent to child, who will have a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene.

Research has shown an association between MVP and primary cilia defects. Studies have identified mutations in the Zinc finger protein DZIP1 gene which regulates ciliogenesis; the same problem was found in mice who also developed MVP with this gene. It was found that primary cilia loss during development results in progressive myxomatous degeneration and profound mitral valve pathology.

Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is a genetic abnormality that is mapped to the Xq28 gene. And additionally to FLNA.

To date, only one of the genes that have been associated with MVP is a direct regulator of connective tissue maintenance and extracellular matrix composition: TLL1, in a gain-of-function mechanism .

Other genes that have been associated with MVP include:

* 13.q31.3-q32.1
* 16p12.1-p11.2
* Ch16p11.2-p12.1
* 11p15.4
* DCHS1
Genetic and chromosome defect causes of MVP are complex and currently not fully understood. Further research is needed to fully identify all of the genes and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of MVP.
=== Other ===
Recent studies have suggested an association between MVP and the upregulation of 5HTR2B expression. This upregulation is associated with increased serotonin (5HT) receptor signaling which is involved in the remodeling of the mitral valve prolapse. The researchers also found that blocking 5HTR2B can reduce mitral valve interstitial cells (MVIC) activation in vitro and MV remodeling in vivo. Suggesting that 5HT receptor signaling plays a role in the pathological remodeling of MVP.

Withdrawn drug such as benfluorex stimulated serotonergic pathways, which lead to valve degeneration with increased valve interstitial cell proliferation resulting in increased rate of valvular pathologies in people taking the drug.

In a 2023 study a potential link between the use of SSRIs and the development of mitral valve regurgitation was found. Findings suggest that SSRIs may accelerate degenerative mitral valve regurgitation (DMR), particularly in people with a specific 5-HTTLPR genotype (&#x27;long-long&#x27;). The researchers recommend genotyping DMR patients to assess serotonin transporter (SERT) activity and advocate for caution in prescribing SSRIs to those with a family history of DMR.

==Diagnosis==
Echocardiography is the most useful method of diagnosing a prolapsed mitral valve. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography is particularly valuable as they allow visualization of the mitral leaflets relative to the mitral annulus. This allows measurement of the leaflet thickness and their displacement relative to the annulus. Thickening of the mitral leaflets &gt;5 mm and leaflet displacement &gt;2 mm above the annular plane in parasternal long-axis view indicates classic mitral valve prolapse.

Prolapsed mitral valves are classified into several subtypes, based on leaflet thickness, type of connection to the mitral annulus, and concavity. Subtypes can be described as classic, nonclassic, symmetric, asymmetric, flail, or non-flail.

All measurements below refer to adult patients; applying them to children may be misleading.

===Classic versus nonclassic===
Prolapse occurs when the mitral valve leaflets are displaced more than 2 mm above the mitral annulus high points. The condition can be further divided into classic and nonclassic subtypes based on the thickness of the mitral valve leaflets: up to 5 mm is considered nonclassic, while anything beyond 5 mm is considered classic MVP.

===Symmetric versus asymmetric===
Classical prolapse may be subdivided into symmetric and asymmetric, referring to the point at which leaflet tips join the mitral annulus. In symmetric coaptation, leaflet tips meet at a common point on the annulus. Asymmetric coaptation is marked by one leaflet displaced toward the atrium with respect to the other. Patients with asymmetric prolapse are susceptible to severe deterioration of the mitral valve, with the possible rupture of the chordae tendineae and the development of a flail leaflet.

===Flail versus non-flail===

Asymmetric prolapse is further subdivided into flail and non-flail. Flail prolapse occurs when a leaflet tip turns outward, becoming concave toward the left atrium, causing the deterioration of the mitral valve. The severity of flail leaflet varies, ranging from tip eversion to chordal rupture. Dissociation of leaflet and chordae tendineae provides for unrestricted motion of the leaflet (hence &quot;flail leaflet&quot;). Thus patients with flail leaflets have a higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation than those with the non-flail subtype.

==Treatment==

Individuals with mitral valve prolapse, particularly those without symptoms, often require no treatment. Those with mitral valve prolapse and symptoms of dysautonomia (palpitations, chest pain) may benefit from beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol). People with prior stroke or atrial fibrillation may require blood thinners, such as aspirin or warfarin. In rare instances when mitral valve prolapse is associated with severe mitral regurgitation, surgical repair or replacement of the mitral valve may be necessary. Mitral valve repair is generally considered preferable to replacement. Current ACC/AHA guidelines promote repair of mitral valve in people before symptoms of heart failure develop. Symptomatic people, those with evidence of diminished left ventricular function, or those with left ventricular dilatation need urgent attention.

===Prevention of infective endocarditis===
Individuals with MVP are at higher risk of bacterial infection of the heart, called infective endocarditis. This risk is approximately three-to eightfold the risk of infective endocarditis in the general population. Until 2007, the American Heart Association recommended prescribing antibiotics before invasive procedures, including those in dental surgery. Thereafter, they concluded that &quot;prophylaxis for dental procedures should be recommended only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis.&quot;

Many organisms responsible for endocarditis are slow-growing and may not be easily identified on routine blood cultures (these fastidious organisms require special culture media to grow). These include the HACEK organisms, which are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora and are responsible for perhaps 5 to 10% of infective endocarditis affecting native valves. It is important when considering endocarditis to keep these organisms in mind.

==Prognosis==
Generally, MVP is benign. However, MVP patients with a murmur, not just an isolated click, have an increased mortality rate of 15-20%. The major predictors of mortality are the severity of mitral regurgitation and reduction in ejection fraction.

Close monitoring and treatment, if necessary, is recommended for those with severe MVP to prevent complications and reduce the risk of mortality. In most cases, individuals with MVP can lead a normal and healthy life with minimal symptoms.

== Prophylaxis ==
The consensus is that mitral valve prolapse is a non-preventable condition, although some of its complications may occur. Because symptoms rarely appear, the productivity of the patient&#x27;s life is not affected. The worsening of the disorder can be delayed by avoiding smoking, the use of contraceptives (because they have the risk of clotting) and regulating the amount and type of exercise and nutrition under the supervision of a health professional. The risk of infective endocarditis is considered high in patients with prosthetic heart valves, moderate in those with mitral prolapse concomitant with mitral regurgitation and low in patients with mitral prolapse without other valve disease.

=== Antibiotic prophylaxis ===
Those with mitral prolapse are at increased risk of infective endocarditis, a bacterial infection of the heart tissue, as a result of certain routine non-sterile procedures, such as brushing the teeth. However, in April 2007, a study by the American Heart Association had determined that the risks of prescribing antibiotics outweigh the prophylactic antibiotics before invasive surgery, such as dental surgery or biopsy by colonoscopy or bronchoscopy.

==Epidemiology==
Prior to the strict criteria for the diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse, as described above, the incidence of mitral valve prolapse in the general population varied greatly. Some studies estimated the incidence of mitral valve prolapse at 5 to 15 percent or even higher. One 1985 study suggested MVP in up to 35% of healthy teenagers.

Recent elucidation of mitral valve anatomy and the development of three-dimensional echocardiography have resulted in improved diagnostic criteria, and the true prevalence of MVP based on these criteria is estimated at 2-3%. As a part of the Framingham Heart Study, for example, the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in Framingham, MA was estimated at 2.4%. There was a near-even split between classic and nonclassic MVP, with no significant age or sex discrimination. MVP is observed in 7% of autopsies in the United States.

In a Taiwanese CHIEF heart study of Asian adult military personnel, it was estimated that out of 2442 people in Hualien aged 18 to 39, mitral valve prolapse occurred in 3.36%. People with MVP had lower body mass index, somatic symptoms related to exercise (chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations during exercise) and systolic click in auscultation. 7 out of 82 participants with MVP had mild pectus excavatum.

== Research ==
In a human and mice study of MVP, a relationship was found between MVP and progressive fibrosis effects on left ventricular structure, which suggests the cause of molecular and cellular changes are a response of papillary and inferobasal myocardium to increased chordal tension from prolapsing mitral valve leaflets.

=== In animals ===
In 2019 an experimental adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy method was developed by Rejuvenate Bio, a biotechnology company. The method was successfully and effectively used on mice to reverse multiple age-related diseases: heart failure, kidney failure, type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study found that mice experienced a 58% increase in heart function and 75% reduction in kidney degeneration. Rejuvenate Bio later collaborated with Tufts University to use the same method on Cavalier King Charles spaniel to stop the progression of mitral valve disease by stopping the accumulation of scar tissue in the heart. The therapy used a virus to deliver a genetic therapy that blocks the action of a specific protein that contributes to the accumulation of scar tissue.

==History==
The term &quot;mitral valve prolapse&quot; was coined by J. Michael Criley in 1966 and gained acceptance over the other descriptor of &quot;billowing&quot; of the mitral valve, as described by John Brereton Barlow.

<doc id="545918" wikidata="Q693058" url="?curid=545918" title="Chest pain">
<text>Chest pain is pain or discomfort in the chest, typically the front of the chest. It may be described as sharp, dull, pressure, heaviness or squeezing. Associated symptoms may include pain in the shoulder, arm, upper abdomen, or jaw, along with nausea, sweating, or shortness of breath. It can be divided into heart-related and non-heart-related pain. Pain due to insufficient blood flow to the heart is also called angina pectoris. Those with diabetes or the elderly may have less clear symptoms.
Serious and relatively common causes include acute coronary syndrome such as a heart attack (31%), pulmonary embolism (2%), pneumothorax, pericarditis (4%), aortic dissection (1%) and esophageal rupture. Other common causes include gastroesophageal reflux disease (30%), muscle or skeletal pain (28%), pneumonia (2%), shingles (0.5%), pleuritis, traumatic and anxiety disorders. Determining the cause of chest pain is based on a person&#x27;s medical history, a physical exam and other medical tests. About 3% of heart attacks, however, are initially missed.
Management of chest pain is based on the underlying cause. Initial treatment often includes the medications aspirin and nitroglycerin. The response to treatment does not usually indicate whether the pain is heart-related. When the cause is unclear, the person may be referred for further evaluation.
Chest pain represents about 5% of presenting problems to the emergency room. In the United States, about 8 million people go to the emergency department with chest pain a year. Of these, about 60% are admitted to either the hospital or an observation unit. The cost of emergency visits for chest pain in the United States is more than US$8 billion per year. Chest pain accounts for about 0.5% of visits by children to the emergency department.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Chest pain may present in different ways depending upon the underlying diagnosis. Chest pain may also vary from person to person based upon age, sex, weight, and other differences. Chest pain may present as a stabbing, burning, aching, sharp, or pressure-like sensation in the chest. Chest pain may also radiate, or move, to several other areas of the body. This may include the neck, left or right arms, cervical spine, back, and upper abdomen. Other associated symptoms with chest pain can include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, anxiety, and sweating. The type, severity, duration, and associated symptoms of chest pain can help guide diagnosis and further treatment.

==Differential diagnosis==
Causes of chest pain range from non-serious to life-threatening.

In adults the most common causes of chest pain include: gastrointestinal (42%), coronary artery disease (31%), musculoskeletal (28%), pericarditis (4%) and pulmonary embolism (2%). Other less common causes include: pneumonia, lung cancer, and aortic aneurysms. Psychogenic causes of chest pain can include panic attacks; however, this is a diagnosis of exclusion.

In children, the most common causes for chest pain are musculoskeletal (76–89%), exercise-induced asthma (4–12%), gastrointestinal illness (8%), and psychogenic causes (4%). Chest pain in children can also have congenital causes.

===Cardiovascular===

* Acute coronary syndrome
** Stable or unstable angina
** Myocardial infarction (&quot;heart attack&quot;): People typically present with pressure or squeezing sensation over the chest in addition to sweating, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Chest pain is more commonly associated with anterior infarction because of left ventricular impairment; inferior infarction is more commonly associated with nausea, vomiting, and excessive sweating due to irritation of vagus nerve; lateral infarction is associated with left arm pain. 
* Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina: Chest pain is caused by coronary vasospasm. It is more common in women younger than 50 years and has associations with tobacco, cocaine, or triptan use. People usually complain of chest pain at rest that is unrelated to stress or exertion. It is often relieved by cessation of the offending drug and the administration of nitrates or calcium channel blockers. 
* Cocaine use: This condition is suspected when people with few risk factors for arteriosclerosis present with non-traumatic chest pain. Ingestion of cocaine can lead to vasoconstriction of coronary arteries, thus producing chest pain similar to heart attack. Symptoms can appear within one hour of cocaine use.
* Aortic stenosis: This condition occurs in individuals with underlying congenital bicuspid valve, aortic sclerosis, or a history of rheumatic fever. Chest pain usually happens during physical activity. Syncope is a late symptom. Signs and symptoms of heart failure may also be present. On auscultation, a loud ejection systolic murmur can be heard at the right second intercostal space with radiation to the carotid artery in the neck. Splitting of second heart sound is heard in severe stenosis.
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: It is the hypertrophy of interventricular septum that causes outflow obstruction of the left ventricle. Dyspnea and chest pain commonly occur during daily activities. Syncope may also occur. On physical examination, significant findings include: loud systolic murmur and palpable triple apical impulse due to a palpable presystolic fourth heart sound.
* Aortic dissection is characterized by severe chest pain that radiates the back. It is usually associated with Marfan&#x27;s syndrome and hypertension. On examination, the murmur of aortic insufficiency can be heard with unequal radial pulses.
* Pericarditis: This condition can be the result of viral infection such as coxsackie virus and echovirus, tuberculosis, autoimmune disease, uremia, and after myocardial infarction (Dressler syndrome). The chest pain is often pleuritic in nature (associated with respiration) which is aggravated when lying down and relieved on sitting forward, sometimes, accompanied by fever. On auscultation, pericardial friction rub can be heard.
*Cardiac tamponade: Cardiac tamponade occurs due to fluid accumulation in the pericardial space and typically presents with chest pain often accompanied by symptoms like dyspnea, hypotension, and pulsus paradoxus. Clinical signs include Beck&#x27;s triad—hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds.
*Arrhythmia: Atrial fibrillation and several other arrhythmias can cause chest pain.
*Myocarditis: Myocarditis often affects young men under 45, presenting with symptoms such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat, palpitations, difficulty breathing, and early heart failure signs. Approximately one-third experience sharp, squeezing chest pain, while nonspecific symptoms like fever, fatigue, and muscle aches may also occur. Common causes range from viral infections like Coxsackie and adenovirus to bacterial, fungal, chemical exposures, and autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
*Mitral valve prolapse syndrome: Those affected are usually slim females presented with chest pain which is sharp in quality, localized at the apex, and relieved when lying down. Other symptoms include: shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations. On auscultation, midsystolic click followed by late systolic murmur can be heard, louder when person is in standing position.
*Aortic aneurysm: Aortic aneurysms, particularly when they rupture or dissect, cause sudden, severe chest or back pain often described as tearing or ripping. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually asymptomatic until they expand or rupture at which point they often have a &gt;94% mortality rate.

===Respiratory===
* Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and Bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Chest pain usually happens during a strenuous activity or heavy exercise.
* Bronchitis: Bronchitis occurs due to inflammation of the bronchial tubes, often triggered by viral infections or irritants like smoke, leading to excessive mucus production and airway obstruction. Common symptoms include a productive cough, wheezing, mild chest discomfort, and fatigue.
* Pulmonary embolism: Common signs and symptoms are shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, blood in sputum during cough, and lower limb swelling. Risk factors includes: recent surgery, cancer, and bedridden state. Embolus source usually comes from venous thromboembolism.
* Pneumonia: Pneumonia arises from infections that cause inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli of the lungs, with bacterial pathogens like &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; being common culprits. Clinically, it manifests as fever, persistent cough, difficulty breathing, and pleuritic chest pain that worsens with deep breaths.
* Hemothorax: A hemothorax occurs from accumulation of blood in the pleural cavity, commonly due to trauma, vascular injury, or coagulopathies, which can disrupt lung expansion and oxygenation. Key symptoms include sharp chest pain, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure in severe cases, and diminished breath sounds accompanied by dullness to percussion over the affected area.
* Pneumothorax: Those who are at a higher risk of developing pneumothorax are tall, slim male smokers who have had underlying lung diseases such as emphysema. Those affected can have a sharp chest pain which radiates to the shoulder of the same side. Physical examination revealed absent breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side of the chest.
* Pleurisy: (Pleuritic Chest Pain) The pain is sharp, localized, and is frequently exacerbated with coughing or inspiration. It can be attributed to various etiologies including pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pericarditis, and viral pleurisy. 
* Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, which primarily infects the lungs, leading to Granuloma formation as the immune system walls off the bacteria. Symptoms include chronic cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and pleuritic chest pain if the pleura is involved, often worsening with deep breaths or coughing.
* Tracheitis: Tracheitis, usually a bacterial driven inflammation of the trachea, which often narrows the airway. It can present as stridor and may cause respiratory distress symptoms like tachypnea, cyanosis, and hoarseness. Clinical symptoms include a dry, painful cough that worsens at night and may progress to a productive cough, fever, and retrosternal chest pain due to irritation of tracheal mucosa.
* Lung cancer: Hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and other constitutional symptoms are commonly seen in lung cancer

===Gastrointestinal===

* Gastroesophageal reflux disease: The pain is aggravated when lying down or after meals. Affected individuals may describe this as a heartburn. Besides, they may also complain of tasting bitter contents from the stomach.
* Achalasia, nutcracker esophagus, and other motility disorders of the esophagus
* Diffuse esophageal spasm: Unlike cardiac chest pain, esophageal pain is not related to activity. The pain is usually associated with swallowing of hot or cold water.
* Esophageal rupture: Those affected usually complain of sudden, severe, and constant pain that starts from the neck to the upper abdomen. The pain is aggravated by swallowing. On examination, neck swelling and Crepitus can be felt due to subcutaneous emphysema as free air is entering from esophagus into the subcutaneous tissue.
* Esophagitis: There are many causes of esophagitis. Esophagitis caused by &quot;Candida albicans&quot; is usually found in people on chemotherapy or with HIV. Medication such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and alendronate can induce esophagitis if not swallowed properly.
* Functional dyspepsia: Functional dyspepsia is characterized by upper abdominal discomfort without an identifiable organic cause. Symptoms include epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, early satiety, bloating, nausea, and belching; notably, chest pain can also manifest, potentially mimicking cardiac conditions
* Hiatus hernia: A hiatal hernia occurs when a portion of the stomach pushes upward through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. While gastroesophageal reflux, presenting as heartburn and regurgitation, is the hallmark symptom, other manifestations such as dysphagia, epigastric or chest pain, and chronic iron deficiency anemia may also occur.
* Jackhammer esophagus (hypercontractile peristalsis): Intense long-lasting esophageal muscle spasm.
* Acute cholecystitis: Characterized by positive Murphy&#x27;s sign where the person has a cessation of inhalation when the doctor places his finger at the right subcostal region of the abdomen.
* Acute pancreatitis: History of excessive alcohol use, cholelithiasis (stones in the gallbladder), and hypertriglyceridemia are risk factors for pancreatitis. The pain is described as sharp, burning, and can worsen after eating.
* Perforated peptic ulcer: Sudden onset of severe pain in the upper abdomen which later develops into peritonitis (inflammation of tissues that lines the abdominal organs).
* Acute gastritis: Common presentations include upper gastrointestinal issues such as epigastric pain, heartburn, bloating, and a feeling of early fullness 

===Chest wall===
* Costochondritis or Tietze&#x27;s syndrome: An inflammation of a costochondral junction. Any movements or palpation of the chest can reproduce the symptoms.
* Spinal nerve problem
* Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition presenting with but not limited to widespread musculoskeletal pain, often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties. Symptoms can vary widely; common reports include chest pain, muscle weakness, abdominal cramps, dizziness, insomnia, and numbness or tingling
* Chest wall problems: Chest pain can arise from musculoskeletal issues ie scleroderma, costochondritis, cervical radiculitis, among others.
* Radiculopathy (Cervical Angina) Cervical spondylosis presents as sharp pain traveling from the neck to the chest and can be reproduced by turning of the neck sideways. Spurling&#x27;s test can help rule out this etiology.
* Precordial catch syndrome: Another benign and harmless form of a sharp, localized chest pain often mistaken for heart disease.
* Breast conditions
* Herpes zoster (shingles): It is usually described as a burning sensation over the chest in a unilateral dermatome distribution. However, diagnosis can be difficult because the pain usually appears before the characteristic rash is visible.
* Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis of the manubriosternal joint is a very uncommon presentation of chest pain
* Bornholm disease: Bornholm disease is a viral illness marked by a brief febrile episode accompanied by sharp pains in the lower chest or upper abdomen. The condition may also involve muscle tenderness and localized swelling, with chest pain being a prominent symptom.
* Rib fracture: Rib fractures often cause pain that intensifies with deep breathing, leading people to breathe shallowly to minimize discomfort, especially after trauma. In individuals with a history of cancer, rib metastases should be considered if symptoms like tenderness, weight loss, fatigue, and reduced appetite are present.

===Psychological===
* Panic attack: Chest pain is a common symptom of panic attacks, with as high as 78% of persons describing chest pain with their worst panic attacks. Overall chest pain is a symptom of up to 48% of sudden-onset panic attacks, and 10% of gradual-onset panic attacks.
* Anxiety: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as chest pain, restlessness, fatigue, and muscle tension
* Clinical depression: Depression, linked to chest pain through its physical and emotional effects, has been shown in studies to independently increase the long-term risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI), potentially contributing to cardiovascular disease.
* Somatization disorder: Somatization disorder can present with chronic physical symptoms without an identifiable medical cause; it often manifests as chest pain and results from underlying psychological distress
* Hypochondria

===Others===
* Hyperventilation syndrome often presents with chest pain and a tingling sensation of the fingertips and around the mouth.
* Tuberculosis: Chest pain associated with tuberculosis often arises from tuberculous pericarditis, a condition caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis affecting the pericardium. This inflammation typically results in symptoms such as chest discomfort, coughing, fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss
* Da Costa&#x27;s syndrome
* Carbon monoxide poisoning: Chest pain, along with symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea, and confusion, can occur as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, which is often mistaken for the flu due to its nonspecific presentation
* Sarcoidosis: Cardiac sarcoidosis involves the formation of granulomas (clusters of inflammatory cells) within the heart tissue, which can lead to chest pain due to inflammation and fibrosis
* Lead poisoning: Chest pain associated with lead poisoning may result from its impact on the cardiovascular system, including hypertension or vascular damage, often occurring in conjunction with fatigue and abdominal pain
* Prolapsed intervertebral disc
* Thoracic outlet syndrome: Occurs when nerves or blood vessels are compressed in the space between the first rib and the collarbone, causing symptoms such as pain in the neck, shoulder, or chest, along with arm weakness or numbness
* Adverse effect from certain medications

==Diagnostic approach==

===History taking===

Knowing a person&#x27;s risk factors can be extremely useful in ruling in or ruling out serious causes of chest pain. For example, heart attack and thoracic aortic dissection are very rare in healthy individuals under 30 years of age, but significantly more common in individuals with significant risk factors, such as older age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, history of coronary artery disease or stroke, positive family history (premature atherosclerosis, cholesterol disorders, heart attack at early age), and other risk factors. Chest pain that radiates to one or both shoulders or arms, chest pain that occurs with physical activity, chest pain associated with nausea or vomiting, chest pain accompanied by diaphoresis or sweating, or chest pain described as &quot;pressure,&quot; has a higher likelihood of being related to acute coronary syndrome, or inadequate supply of blood to the heart muscle, but even without these symptoms chest pain may be a sign of acute coronary syndrome. Other clues in the history can help lower the suspicion for myocardial infarction. These include chest pain described as &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;stabbing&quot;, chest pain that is positional or pleuritic in nature, and chest pain that can be reproduced with palpation. However, both atypical and typical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome can occur, and in general a history cannot be enough to rule out the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. In some cases, chest pain may not even be a symptom of an acute cardiac event. An estimated 33% of persons with myocardial infarction in the United States do not present with chest pain, and carry a significantly higher mortality as a result of delayed treatment.

===Physical examination===
Careful medical history and physical examination is essential in separating dangerous from trivial causes of disease, and the management of chest pain may be done on specialized units (termed &quot;medical assessment units&quot;) to concentrate the investigations. Occasionally, invisible medical signs will direct the diagnosis towards particular causes, such as Levine&#x27;s sign in cardiac ischemia. However, in the case of acute coronary syndrome, a third heart sound, diaphoresis, and hypotension are the most strongly associated physical exam findings. However these signs are limited in their prognostic and diagnostic value. Other physical exam findings suggestive of cardiac chest pain may include hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, and new heart murmurs. Chest pain that is reproducible during the physical exam with contact of the chest wall is more indicative of non-cardiac chest pain, but still cannot completely rule out acute coronary syndrome. For this reason, in general, additional tests are required to establish the diagnosis.

In the emergency department the typical approach to chest pain involves ruling out the most dangerous causes: heart attack, pulmonary embolism, thoracic aortic dissection, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac tamponade. By elimination or confirmation of the most serious causes, a diagnosis of the origin of the pain may be made. Often, no definite cause will be found and reassurance is then provided.

=== Risk scores ===
The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score and the Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction performed at time of admission may help stratify persons into low, intermediate and high risk groups for acute coronary syndrome. However these scores do not provide management guidelines for risk-stratified persons.

The HEART score, stratifies persons into low-risk and high-risk groups, and recommends either discharge or admission based upon the score.

Cumulative score:
* 0-3: 2.5% risk of adverse cardiac event. Patient&#x27;s can be discharged with follow-up.
* 4-6: 20.3% risk of adverse cardiac event. Patients should be admitted to the hospital for trending of troponin and provocative testing.
* ≥7: 72.7% risk of adverse cardiac event, suggesting early invasive measures with these patients and close coordination with inpatient cardiology.
If acute coronary syndrome (&quot;heart attack&quot;) is suspected, many people are admitted briefly for observation, sequential ECGs, and measurement of cardiac enzymes in the blood over time. On occasion, further tests on follow up may determine the cause.

===Medical tests===

Depending on the differential diagnoses made based on history and physical examination, a number of tests may be ordered:

&quot;Blood tests:&quot;

* Complete blood count (CBC)
* Cardiac enzymes: troponin, creatine kinase, and myosin for myocardial infarction
* Electrolytes and renal function (creatinine)
* Liver enzymes
* D-dimer: when suspicion for pulmonary embolism is present but low
* Serum Lipase: to exclude acute pancreatitis

&quot;Other tests:&quot;

* Electrocardiogram (ECG)
* Chest radiograph (CXR)
* Echocardiograph: useful in patients with known cardiac disease or aortic dissection
* CT scan: useful in diagnosis of aortic dissection
* V/Q scintigraphy or CT pulmonary angiogram: useful when pulmonary embolism is suspected

==Management==
Management of chest pain varies with the underlying cause of the pain and the stage of care.

=== Prehospital care ===
If a chest pain patient suspects that he is suffering a myocardial infarction, he can calm down, remain in a position that is comfortable, calling emergency medical services and trying any other action of the applicable first aid process.

Chest pain is a common symptom encountered by emergency medical services. Aspirin increases survival in people with acute coronary syndrome and it is reasonable for EMS dispatchers to recommend it in people with no recent serious bleeding. Supplemental oxygen was used in the past for most people with chest pain but is not needed unless the oxygen saturations are less than 94% or there are signs of respiratory distress. Entonox is frequently used by EMS personnel in the prehospital environment. However, there is little evidence about its effectiveness.

=== Hospital care ===
Hospital care of chest pain begins with initial survey of a person&#x27;s vital signs, airway and breathing, and level of consciousness. This may also include attachment of ECG leads, cardiac monitors, intravenous lines and other medical devices depending on initial evaluation. After evaluation of a person&#x27;s history, risk factors, physical examination, laboratory testing and imaging, management begins depending on suspected diagnoses. Depending upon the diagnosis, a person may be placed in the intensive care unit, admitted to the hospital, or be treated outpatient. For persons with suspected cardiac chest pain or acute coronary syndrome, or other emergent diagnoses such as pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection, admission to the hospital is most often recommended for further treatment.

=== Outpatient care ===
For people with non-cardiac chest pain, cognitive behavioral therapy might be helpful on an outpatient basis. A 2015 Cochrane review found that cognitive behavioral therapy might reduce the frequency of chest pain episodes the first three months after treatment. For persons with chest pain due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, a proton-pump inhibitor has been shown to be the most effective treatment. However, treatment with proton pump inhibitors has been shown to be no better than placebo in persons with noncardiac chest pain not caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. For musculoskeletal causes of chest pain, manipulation therapy or chiropractic therapy, acupuncture, or a recommendation for increased exercise are often used as treatment. Studies have shown conflicting results on the efficacy of these treatments. A combination therapy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and manipulation therapy with at-home exercises has been shown to be most effective in treatment of musculoskeletal chest pain.

== Epidemiology ==

Chest pain is a common presenting problem. Overall chest pain is responsible for an estimated 6% of all emergency department visits in the United States and is the most common reason for hospital admission. Chest pain is also very common in primary care clinics, representing 1-3% of all visits. The rate of emergency department visits in the US for chest pain decreased 10% from 1999 to 2008. but a subsequent increase of 13% was seen from 2006 to 2011. Less than 20% of all cases of chest pain admissions are found to be due to coronary artery disease. The rate of chest pain as a symptom of acute coronary syndrome varies among populations based upon age, sex, and previous medical conditions. In general, women are more likely than men to present without chest pain (49% vs. 38%) in cases of myocardial infarction.

<text>The Federal Art Project (1935–1943) was a New Deal program to fund the visual arts in the United States. Under national director Holger Cahill, it was one of five Federal Project Number One projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and the largest of the New Deal art projects. It was created not as a cultural activity, but as a relief measure to employ artists and artisans to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts. The WPA Federal Art Project established more than 100 community art centers throughout the country, researched and documented American design, commissioned a significant body of public art without restriction to content or subject matter, and sustained some 10,000 artists and craft workers during the Great Depression. According to &quot;American Heritage&quot;, “Something like 400,000 easel paintings, murals, prints, posters, and renderings were produced by WPA artists during the eight years of the project’s existence, virtually free of government pressure to control subject matter, interpretation, or style.”

==Background==

The Federal Art Project was the visual arts arm of Federal Project Number One, a program of the Works Progress Administration, which was intended to provide employment for struggling artists during the Great Depression. Funded under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, it operated from August 29, 1935, until June 30, 1943. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists and artisans to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photographs, Index of American Design documentation, museum and theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts. The Federal Art Project operated community art centers throughout the country where craft workers and artists worked, exhibited, and educated others. The project created more than 200,000 separate works, some of them remaining among the most significant pieces of public art in the country.

The Federal Art Project&#x27;s primary goals were to employ out-of-work artists and to provide art for nonfederal municipal buildings and public spaces. Artists were paid $23.60 a week; tax-supported institutions such as schools, hospitals, and public buildings paid only for materials. The work was divided into art production, art instruction, and art research. The primary output of the art-research group was the Index of American Design, a mammoth and comprehensive study of American material culture.

As many as 10,000 artists were commissioned to produce work for the WPA Federal Art Project, the largest of the New Deal art projects. Three comparable but distinctly separate New Deal art projects were administered by the United States Department of the Treasury: the Public Works of Art Project (1933–1934), the Section of Painting and Sculpture (1934–1943), and the Treasury Relief Art Project (1935–1938).

The WPA program made no distinction between representational and nonrepresentational art. Abstraction had not yet gained favor in the 1930s and 1940s, so was virtually unsalable. As a result, the Federal Art Project supported such iconic artists as Jackson Pollock before their work could earn them income.

One particular success was the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, which started in 1935 as an experiment that employed 900 people who were classified as unemployable due to their age or disability. The project came to employ about 5,000 unskilled workers, many of them women and the long-term unemployed. Historian John Gurda observed that the city&#x27;s unemployment hovered at 40% in 1933. &quot;In that year,&quot; he said, &quot;53 percent of Milwaukee&#x27;s property taxes went unpaid because people just could not afford to make the tax payments.&quot; Workers were taught bookbinding, block printing, and design, which they used to create handmade art books and children&#x27;s books. They produced toys, dolls, theatre costumes, quilts, rugs, draperies, wall hangings, and furniture that were purchased by schools, hospitals, and municipal organizations for the cost of materials only. In 2014, when the Museum of Wisconsin Art mounted an exhibition of items created by the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, furniture from it was still being used at the Milwaukee Public Library.

Holger Cahill was national director of the Federal Art Project. Other administrators included Audrey McMahon, director of the New York Region (New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia); Clement B. Haupers, director for Minnesota; George Godfrey Thorp (Illinois), and Robert Bruce Inverarity, director for Washington. Regional New York supervisors of the Federal Art Project have included sculptor William Ehrich (1897–1960) of the Buffalo Unit (1938–1939), project director of the Buffalo Zoo expansion.

==Community Art Center program==

The first federally sponsored community art center opened in December 1936 in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
==Index of American Design==


The Index of American Design program of the Federal Art Project produced a pictorial survey of the crafts and decorative arts of the United States from the early colonial period to 1900. Artists working for the Index produced nearly 18,000 meticulously faithful watercolor drawings, documenting material culture by largely anonymous artisans. Objects surveyed ranged from furniture, silver, glass, stoneware and textiles to tavern signs, ships&#x27;s figureheads, cigar-store figures, carousel horses, toys, tools and weather vanes. Photography was used only to a limited degree since artists could more accurately and effectively present the form, character, color and texture of the objects. The best drawings approach the work of such 19th-century trompe-l&#x27;œil painters as William Harnett; lesser works represent the process of artists who were given employment and expert training.

&quot;It was not a nostalgic or antiquarian enterprise,&quot; wrote historian Roger G. Kennedy. &quot;It was initiated by modernists dedicated to abstract design, hoping to influence industrial design — thus in many ways it parallelled the founding philosophy of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.&quot;

Like all WPA programs, the Index had the primary purpose of providing employment. Its function was to identify and record material of historical significance that had not been studied and was in danger of being lost. Its aim was to gather together these pictorial records into a body of material that would form the basis for organic development of American design — a usable American past accessible to artists, designers, manufacturers, museums, libraries and schools. The United States had no single comprehensive collection of authenticated historical native design comparable to those available to scholars, artists and industrial designers in Europe.

&quot;In one sense the Index is a kind of archaeology,&quot; wrote Holger Cahill. &quot;It helps to correct a bias which has tended to relegate the work of the craftsman and the folk artist to the subconscious of our history where it can be recovered only by digging. In the past we have lost whole sequences out of their story, and have all but forgotten the unique contribution of hand skills in our culture.&quot;

The Index of American Design operated in 34 states and the District of Columbia from 1935 to 1942. It was founded by Romana Javitz, head of the Picture Collection of the New York Public Library, and textile designer Ruth Reeves. Reeves was appointed the first national coordinator; she was succeeded by C. Adolph Glassgold (1936) and Benjamin Knotts (1940). Constance Rourke was national editor. The work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

The Index employed an average of 300 artists during its six years in operation. One artist was Magnus S. Fossum, a longtime farmer who was compelled by the Depression to move from the Midwest to Florida. After he lost his left hand in an accident in 1934, he produced watercolor renderings for the Index, using magnifiers and drafting instruments for accuracy and precision. Fossum eventually received an insurance settlement that made it possible for him to buy another farm and leave the Federal Art Project.

In her essay,&#x27;Picturing a Usable Past,&#x27; Virginia Tuttle Clayton, curator of the 2002-2003 exhibition, &quot;Drawing on America&#x27;s Past: Folk Art, Modernism, and the Index of American Design&quot;, held at the National Gallery of Art noted that &quot;the Index of American Design was the result of an ambitious and creative effort to furnish for the visual arts a usable past.&quot;
==Poster Division==
The WPA Poster Division was headed by Richard Floethe. The WPA Poster Division is thought to have produced upward of 35,000 designs and printed some two million posters, originally by hand but quickly transitioning to widespread adoption of the silkscreen process. The Poster Division began in New York City and by 1938 had artists in 18 states; the Chicago unit was the second-most productive after New York. According to preeminent New Deal art historian Francis V. O’Connor, only about 2,000 surviving examples of WPA poster art are held in the nation’s library and museum print collections.

==WPA Art Recovery Project==
Hundreds of thousands of artworks were commissioned under the Federal Art Project. Many of the portable works have been lost, abandoned, or given away as unauthorized gifts. As custodian of the work, which remains federal property, the General Services Administration (GSA) maintains an inventory and works with the FBI and art community to identify and recover WPA art. In 2010, it produced a 22-minute documentary about the WPA Art Recovery Project, &quot;Returning America’s Art to America&quot;, narrated by Charles Osgood.

In July 2014, the GSA estimated that only 20,000 of the portable works have been located to date. In 2015, GSA investigators found 122 Federal Art Project paintings in California libraries, where most had been stored and forgotten.

<text>Infected Mushroom is an Israeli musical duo formed in Haifa in 1996 by producers Erez Eisen and Amit Duvdevani. They produce and perform psytrance, electronica, dream trance and psychedelic music. They are one of the best-selling groups in Israeli music history in terms of both domestic and international sales.

They employ a variety of musical sources, including acoustic guitars and complex synthesized basses. Their compositions often contain changes of drum beat and tempo. Infected Mushroom&#x27;s live shows feature vocals and analogue instruments in performances that are set against a multimedia backdrop.

== Members ==

Erez Eisen was born on 8 September 1980 in Qiryat Yam, Israel. He began classical musical training at a young age, learning to play the organ at the age of four and studying classical piano at the Haifa Conservatory from the age of eight. Eisen later became involved with computerized music, beginning with Impulse Tracker and later moving to more advanced musical composition software.

Eisen had collaborated with DJ Jörg and other notable psytrance artists by the age of 18, and has released three albums and many singles under other psytrance monikers, including Shidapu and Shiva Shidapu.

Amit Duvdevani was born on 7 November 1974 in Israel and has a similar musical background as Eisen. He started to play classical piano at age seven and continued to do so for nine years. He then progressed to heavy metal music and punk rock. Duvdevani played keyboards and wrote most of the material for the Haifa punk rock band Enzyme—he attended his first trance party in 1991.

Duvdevani was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces, where he was first nicknamed, &quot;Duvdev&quot;. After he finished his conscription in Israel, Duvdevani lived in India for a year, primarily in the Indian state of Goa. Duvdevani later collaborated with a member of Shiva Shidapu on four tracks, but they were never released.

== Career ==
=== 1996–2004: First four studio albums ===
Eisen and Duvdevani first began to play together in 1996. A few of their early efforts were released under the name Shidapu &amp; Duvdev. The duo then renamed themselves Infected Mushroom, a name they stole from a local punk band that had been disbanded. The young duo drew inspiration from The Prodigy and Metallica. In an interview with Psychedelic Magazine, the duo stated they were naturally attracted to the psytrance genre through its popularity. In 1998 the group began work on their first album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Gathering&quot;, inspired by Simon Posford, X-Dream and Transwave. This album featured a dark, rhythmic sonic atmosphere exemplified by its popular track, &quot;Psycho&quot;, using a sample from the movie Batman &amp; Robin. It was one of the first albums to bring to mainstream audiences, and contributed to the genre&#x27;s worldwide popularity.

Their 2000 album, &quot;Classical Mushroom&quot;, contained &quot;Bust a Move&quot;. The album is commonly referred to as one of the group&#x27;s best efforts, one in which they continued their sonic evolution, and it remains one of the best-known albums in the genre.

The duo&#x27;s 2001 &quot;B.P. Empire&quot; is notable for the musical epic &quot;Dancing with Kadafi&quot;, which segues numerous styles of music, most notably through middle-eastern style melodies and a classical break which showcases Erez and Amit&#x27;s piano skills. The name &quot;Dancing with Kadafi&quot; may be a reference to Erez&#x27;s cat, who was named Kadafi.

&quot;Converting Vegetarians&quot; (2003), was a two-disc set. The &#x27;Trance Side&#x27; disc contained trance-like dancefloor material comparable to their earlier work, while the disc entitled &#x27;The Other Side&#x27; contained genre-bending experimental music. &#x27;The Other Side&#x27; included Duvdev&#x27;s vocal debut on the title track, the down-tempo &quot;Elation Station&quot;, and the electro-pop tracks &quot;Blink&quot; and &quot;Illuminaughty&quot;.

=== 2004–2007: &quot;IM the Supervisor&quot; and increasing popularity ===

The 2004 release of &quot;IM The Supervisor&quot;, continued to mix psytrance with other musical genres and became Infected Mushroom&#x27;s best-selling album to date. It was psychedelic in a way that dance music rarely had been prior to its release. Certain parts of IM The Supervisor, most notably the gamelan-like noises, cut-up samples, and the old-school sequencer throb of &quot;Bombat,&quot; were lauded as innovative at the time.

Infected Mushroom rose to #9 in the influential DJmag Top 100 DJs poll and were the highest placed psytrance DJs in the category&#x27;s 2007 debut appearance, a reflection of the role the group had played in the genre&#x27;s increased worldwide popularity.

=== 2007–2012: &quot;Vicious Delicious&quot; and &quot;Legend of the Black Shawarma&quot; ===

&quot;Vicious Delicious&quot;, considered by some as their most diverse musical effort up until that point, was released in 2007. The album includes &quot;Becoming Insane&quot;—a Spanish-guitar-led track containing Spanish lyrics—a collaboration with Gil Cerezo of the Mexican band Kinky, and the hip hop-influenced &quot;Artillery&quot; featuring rappers Swollen Members. The overall album features more guest vocalists than previous albums, as well as live guitars and drums.

&quot;Legend of the Black Shawarma&quot; was released in 2009. It includes a remix of The Doors song &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, and continues the stylistic variety and use of guest vocalists. The album title refers to an Australian who wanted to go to sea in a shark-proof cage and was told that he would seem like &quot;black shawarma&quot;, a West Asian delicacy, to the sharks. The success of &quot;Legend of the Black Shawarma&quot; led to a three-year tour.

=== 2012–2015: &quot;Army of Mushrooms&quot; and &quot;Friends on Mushrooms&quot; ===

The band&#x27;s album, &quot;Army of Mushrooms&quot;, was released on 8 May 2012 on the Dim Mak Records label. It features tracks influenced by the psychedelic trance, dubstep, house and drum and bass genres, such as the up-tempo, breakbeat track &quot;The Rat&quot;. The album includes a cover of &quot;The Pretender&quot; by the Foo Fighters, the progressive heavy-hitter &quot;Drum n&#x27; Bassa&quot; and &quot;Nation of Wusses&quot;—released as a single on 3 April 2012—and &quot;U R So Fucked&quot;, released as a single/video on 14 February 2012.

A large-scale North American tour was launched on 12 May 2012, called &quot;The Unveiling&quot;, and featured revamped stage production and novel audio/visual live aspects. The new live production featured Erez and Duvdev within two specially designed hollow spheres placed on stage, among other high tech additions to the band&#x27;s live set-up and multimedia backdrop.

January 2013 saw the duo embark on their &quot;FungusAmongUS&quot; tour across North America, with special guests The M Machine. The &quot;FungusAmongUS&quot; tour was designed by Vita Motus and V Squared Labs, the creators of Amon Tobin&#x27;s ISAM production and Skrillex&#x27;s live Cell production.

The duo released a collaborative EP named &quot;Friends&quot; on &quot;Mushrooms Vol. 1&quot; in January 2013, again under Dim Mak Records. The EP consists of tracks featuring Astrix and Hatikva 6. In July 2013, the duo released &quot;Friends on Mushrooms Vol. 2&quot;, also under Dim Mak Records, which consisted of collaborations with Pegboard Nerds, Savant and Kelsy Karter. In mid-2013, Infected Mushroom embarked on a tour in support of the &quot;Vol. 2&quot; release that featured the duo &quot;set against an incredible three dimensional landscape that brings INFECTED MUSHROOM&#x27;s visual and sonic journey to life.&quot;

In August 2013, due to the leaked song &quot;Aura&quot;, Infected Mushroom was revealed as a production team on Lady Gaga&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Artpop&quot;. &quot;Friends on Mushrooms Vol. 3&quot; was released on 17 June 2014 and includes a collaboration with Savant.

On 1 April 2014, Duvdevani said that Infected Mushroom will be releasing a new album at the end of the year. It was later revealed that Infected Mushroom will in fact be releasing a compilation of the tracks from the Friends On Mushrooms extended plays, bundled together with two new tracks, &quot;Kafkaf&quot; and &quot;Kazabubu&quot;. This was released on 6 January 2015.

=== 2015–2018: &quot;Converting Vegetarians II&quot;, &quot;Return to the Sauce&quot;, and Monstercat ===

Following their Animatronica tour, the band officially announced that their new album will be a follow-up to their widely acclaimed 2003 album &quot;Converting Vegetarians&quot;. It was also announced that the vocals of Sasha Grey will be featured on the track &quot;Fields of Grey&quot;. The album was released on 11 September 2015.

On 27 January 2017, the band released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Return to the Sauce&quot;, which features their signature psy-trance sound. This is in stark contrast to &quot;Converting Vegetarians II&quot;, which is more ambient and down-tempo in style. The release of &quot;Return to the Sauce&quot; was preceded by two singles, &quot;Liquid Smoke&quot; and &quot;Nutmeg&quot;.

On 24 November 2017, the band released their single &quot;Spitfire&quot; on the Canadian independent record label Monstercat.

=== 2018–present: &quot;IM21 Pt.1&quot; and Monstercat albums ===
On 9 March 2018, the band released &quot;IM21, Pt.1&quot; under the label Hommega. It is composed of remixes of &quot;Bust a Move&quot;, &quot;Suliman&quot;, &quot;Saeed&quot;, &quot;Yamakas in space&quot;, and an acoustic live remix of &quot;i-Wish&quot;. These were remixed by groups such as Bliss, No Comment, Paranormal Attack and Modulation. The acoustic remix of &quot;i-Wish&quot; was done by the band itself.

On 30 October 2018, the band announced a new full-length album titled &quot;Head of NASA and the 2 Amish Boys&quot;. The album was released through Monstercat on 12 December that same year. There are seven tracks on the album which are mainly electronic with psytrance influences and include one hip-hop collaboration song with Israeli artist Tuna and Israeli girl band A-WA in Hebrew, Arabic and English – &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

In 2020, the group released their 12th album &quot;More Than Just a Name&quot;. It features collaborations with Astrix and Bliss. The track &quot;Infected Megamix&quot; features a montage of past popular Infected Mushroom songs.

On July 7, 2022, Infected Mushroom released the single &quot;A Cookie from Space&quot;, announced to be the first single from their 25-year anniversary album, &quot;IM25&quot;.

In October 2023 Infected Mushroom released the single &quot;Tirkod LaNezach&quot; (, lit. &quot;Dance Forever&quot;) alongside the Israeli singer Omer Adam, dedicated to the victims of the Supernova music festival massacre.

== Touring ==
On average, the band completes 120 live annual performances, including the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, US; the Virgin Festival in Baltimore, US; Mexico&#x27;s OMIX; California, US&#x27; Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival; Brazil&#x27;s Ipanema Beach; Melbourne, Australia&#x27;s Metro Club; and the 2009, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2022 and 2024 Burning Man Festivals in Black Rock City, Nevada, US. Infected Mushroom have been twice ranked among the world&#x27;s &quot;10 Best DJ&#x27;s&quot; by readers of U.K.&#x27;s &quot;DJ Magazine&quot;.

<doc id="545933" wikidata="Q785098" url="?curid=545933" title="The One (2001 film)">
<text>The One is a 2001 American science fiction action film directed by James Wong, and written by Wong and Glen Morgan. It stars Jet Li, Delroy Lindo, Carla Gugino, and Jason Statham, with action choreography by Corey Yuen.

The film, which deals with the concept of multiverses and interdimensional travel, follows Gabriel Yulaw (Jet Li), a rogue agent who travels to parallel realities in order for him to kill other versions of himself to become a mythical super-being known as &quot;The One&quot;. Li plays a dual role as Yulaw and Gabe Law, an LASD deputy sheriff who teams up with a multiverse agent to prevent Yulaw from becoming the One.

&quot;The One&quot; was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on November 2, 2001, and received negative critical reviews but grossed $79.6 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Gabriel Yulaw, once an agent of the MultiVerse Authority (MVA) which polices interdimensional travel, seeks to hunt down 124 variants of himself across parallel universes. By killing his other selves and absorbing their life energies, Yulaw believes that he will become a super-powered, godlike being called &quot;The One&quot;.

After killing Lawless, a convict and the 123rd variant in the Anubis Universe, Yulaw is captured by MVA agents Roedecker and Funsch and taken back to the MVA headquarters in the Alpha Universe. He is sentenced to life in the Hades Universe&#x27;s Stygian penal colony, but Yulaw manages to escape with the help of an accomplice and teleports to the Charis Universe.

The last known variant, Gabe Law, is a deputy sheriff working of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department within the Charis Universe. For two years, Gabe has been experiencing increases in strength, speed, and mental ability, but neither he nor his wife T.K. can understand why. While transporting a prisoner, Gabe &quot;feels&quot; Yulaw&#x27;s presence in time to avoid being shot. Gabe sustains an injury after falling from a wall which Yulaw scales with ease. Roedecker and Funsch arrive in time to stop Yulaw from finishing him off.

Although unfamiliar with interdimensional travel, Gabe realizes that Yulaw is identical to him in every way. Rodecker and Funsch track Yulaw to the hospital where Gabe is being examined. Yulaw deters them from shooting him because if he is killed, Gabe would then be left as the One. Dressed alike and identical to each other, Gabe and Yulaw&#x27;s battle confuses the other police officers. Both Gabe and Yulaw manage to escape the hospital.

The MVA agents deviate from their orders and split up. Roedecker pursues and fights Yulaw but is killed when the latter breaks his neck, disabling a bomb Roedecker intended to use to finish both of them off. Funsch catches up with Gabe and explains to him that there are multiple universes with wormholes briefly connecting them at uncontrollable times. Meanwhile, Yulaw sneaks into Gabe&#x27;s residence where T.K., believing him to be Gabe, agrees to hide him from the police. She realizes that Yulaw is deceiving her but not in time to avoid being captured. Gabe arrives, only to watch helplessly as Yulaw kills T.K. Funsch finds a guilt-ridden Gabe and both team up to find Yulaw at the next wormhole.

Gabe and Funsch arrive at an industrial plant, where they encounter and fight Yulaw. Funsch is easily defeated but Gabe and Yulaw are more evenly matched. Gabe manages to gain the upper hand but only seconds before the wormhole arrives. All three of them are sucked into it and collapse on the floor of the MVA headquarters. Yulaw is transported immediately to the Hades Universe after a failed attempt to switch places with Gabe. The MVA then prepares to send Gabe back to his own universe, where he will take the fall for Yulaw&#x27;s crimes. Recalling an earlier conversation with Gabe, Funsch compassionately sends him to a different universe in which Gabe can have a normal life again from when he first met T.K.

Now imprisoned in the Hades Universe, Yulaw declares that he will still become the One and then proceeds to battle several of the penal colony’s inmates on top of a ziggurat.

==Production==
Originally the film was to have starred Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, before Li assumed the lead role.

The hospital scenes were filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center.

The documentary &quot;Jet Li Is &#x27;The One&quot; in the special features section on the DVD explains that both Gabriel Yulaw and &quot;Gabe&quot; Law use martial arts that represent their personalities. Yulaw uses Xingyiquan (The Shape-Will Fist), characterized by aggressive linear movements, while Gabe uses Baguazhang (The Eight Trigram Palms), which uses subtle, circular movements. These martial arts are confirmed by their own personalities as Yulaw is very direct, not caring whom he hurts, while Gabe believes life goes in a circle, perfectly balanced.

The score was composed by Trevor Rabin and was released on December 11, 2001, but no soundtrack album was released. Noted songs in the film:

<doc id="545934" wikidata="Q5645676" url="?curid=545934" title="Hammer v. Dagenhart">
<text>Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251 (1918), was a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court struck down a federal law regulating child labor. The decision was overruled by &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot; (1941).

During the Progressive Era, public sentiment in the United States turned against what was perceived as increasingly intolerable child labor conditions. In response, Congress passed the Keating–Owen Act, prohibiting the sale in interstate commerce of any merchandise that had been made either by children under the age of fourteen, or by children under sixteen who worked more than sixty hours per week. In his majority opinion, Justice William R. Day struck down the Keating–Owen Act, holding that the Commerce Clause did not give Congress the power to regulate working conditions. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. argued that goods manufactured in one state and sold in other states were by definition interstate commerce, and thus Congress should have power to regulate the manufacturing of those goods.

==Background==
During the Progressive Era, public sentiment in the United States turned against what was perceived as increasingly intolerable child labor conditions. Activities of such groups as the National Child Labor Committee, investigative journalists, and labor groups called attention to unhealthy and unsafe working conditions. Historical material presented by the Smithsonian Institution provides a sense of the motivation behind these concerns in an electronic exhibit on the work of the photographer Lewis Hine:

Over and over, Hine saw children working sixty and seventy-hour weeks, by day and by night, often under hazardous conditions. He saw children caught in a cycle of poverty, with parents often so ill-paid that they could not support a family on their earnings alone, and had to rely on their children&#x27;s earnings as a supplement for the family&#x27;s survival. He saw children growing up stunted mentally (illiterate or barely able to read because their jobs kept them out of school) and physically (from lack of fresh air, exercise, and time to relax and play). He saw countless children who had been injured and permanently disabled on the job; he knew that, in the cotton mills for example, children had accident rates three times those of adults.
Responding to the growing public concern, many states sought to impose local restrictions on child labor. In many states, however, the attempt to regulate was ineffective. In addition, manufacturers argued that where restrictions were imposed only in selected states, it placed them at a competitive disadvantage with competitors from states which still placed no restrictions. 

Unable to regulate hours and working conditions for child labor within individual states, Congress sought to regulate child labor by banning the product of that labor from interstate commerce. The Keating-Owen Act of 1916 prohibited interstate commerce of any merchandise that had been made by children under the age of fourteen, or merchandise that had been made in factories where children between the ages of 14 and 16 worked for more than eight hours a day, worked overnight or worked more than sixty hours a week. 

Roland Dagenhart, who worked in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina with his two sons, sued, arguing that this law was unconstitutional. A district court ruled the statute unconstitutional, which caused United States Attorney William C. Hammer to appeal to the Supreme Court. At issue was the question: Does Congress have the authority to regulate commerce of goods that are manufactured by children under the age 14, as specified in the Keating–Owen Act of 1916, and is it within the authority of Congress in regulating commerce among the states to prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of manufactured goods by the child labor description above?

==Majority opinion==
Justice Day, for the majority, said that Congress does not have the power to regulate commerce of goods that are manufactured by children and that the Keating-Owen Act of 1916 was therefore unconstitutional. Drawing a distinction between the manufacture of goods and the regulation of certain goods themselves &quot;inherently evil&quot;, the Court maintained that the issue did not concern the power to keep certain immoral products out of the stream of interstate commerce, distinguishing previous cases upholding Congress&#x27;s power to control lottery schemes, prostitution, and liquor. The Court reasoned that in those cases, the goods themselves were inherently immoral and thus open to congressional scrutiny. In this case, however, the issue at hand was the manufacture of cotton, a good whose use is not immoral. The Court further held that the manufacture of cotton did not in itself constitute interstate commerce. The Court recognized that disparate labor regulations placed the various states on unequal ground in terms of economic competitiveness, but it specifically stated that Congress could not address such inequality, as it was within the right of states to enact differing laws within the scope of their police powers: 

The court reasoned that &quot;The commerce clause was not intended to give to Congress a general authority to equalize such conditions&quot;. The Court added that the federal government was &quot;one of enumerated powers&quot; and could not go beyond the boundary drawn by the 10th Amendment, which the Court misquotes by inserting the word &quot;expressly&quot;:

==Dissenting opinion==
Justice Holmes dissented strongly from the logic and ruling of the majority. He maintained that Congress was completely within its right to regulate interstate commerce and that goods manufactured in one state and sold in other states were, by definition, interstate commerce. That placed the entire manufacturing process under the purview of Congress, and the constitutional power &quot;could not be cut down or qualified by the fact that it might interfere with the carrying out of the domestic policy of any State&quot;.

Holmes also took issue with the majority&#x27;s logic in allowing Congress to regulate goods themselves regarded as immoral, while at the same time disallowing regulation of goods whose use may be considered just as immoral in a more indirect sense: &quot;The notion that prohibition is any less prohibition when applied to things now thought evil I do not understand ... to say that it is permissible as against strong drink but not as against the product of ruined lives.&quot; At the time, the Eighteenth Amendment, banning the sale, manufacture and transport of alcoholic drink, had been approved by Congress and was being ratified by the states.

Holmes also commented on the court&#x27;s rejection of federal restrictions on child labor: &quot;But if there is any matter upon which civilized countries have agreed—it is the evil of premature and excessive child labor.&quot;

==Subsequent developments==

In 1922, another ruling, &quot;Bailey v. Drexel Furniture&quot;, banned Congress from levying a tax on goods produced through child labor entered into interstate trade; both rulings caused the introduction of the Child Labor Amendment.

The ruling of the Court was later overturned and repudiated in a series of decisions handed down in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Specifically, &quot;Hammer v. Dagenhart&quot; was overruled in 1941 in the case of &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot;, . The Court in the &quot;Darby&quot; case sided strongly with Holmes&#x27; dissent, which they called &quot;classic&quot;. They also recast the reading of the Tenth Amendment, regarding it as a &quot;truism&quot; that merely restates what the Constitution had already provided for, rather than offering a substantive protection to the States, as the &quot;Hammer&quot; ruling had contended.

<doc id="545956" wikidata="Q330725" url="?curid=545956" title="The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)">
<text>The Red Hot Chili Peppers is the debut studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on August 10, 1984, via EMI America and Enigma Records. The album was produced by Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill, and is the only Peppers album to feature Jack Sherman on guitar. Sherman was in the band as a replacement for founding member Hillel Slovak, who&#x27;d left the band along with founding drummer Jack Irons before the album was recorded. After the tour for this album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band. The album also features founding members Anthony Kiedis on vocals and Flea on bass, as well as Cliff Martinez on drums.

==Writing and recording==
The band was often at odds with producer Andy Gill over the musical direction of the album. Anthony Kiedis was disappointed with the overall sound, thinking that it lacked the raw energy of the band&#x27;s original 1983 demo tape. In his 2004 autobiography &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, Kiedis recalled, &quot;One day, I got a glimpse of Gill&#x27;s notebook, and next to the song &#x27;Police Helicopter&#x27;, he&#x27;d written &#x27;Shit.&#x27; I was demolished that he had dismissed that as shit. Police Helicopter was a jewel in our crown. It embodied the spirit of who we were, which was this kinetic, stabbing, angular, shocking assault force of sound and energy. Reading his notes probably sealed the deal in our minds that &#x27;Okay, now we&#x27;re working with the enemy&#x27;, It became very much him against us, especially Flea and me. It became a real battle to make the record.&quot;

Flea expressed similar misgivings in a June 2023 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;I always regret the way we made the first one. I think the songs are really good. Our band was smoking at the time. But [drummer] Jack [Irons] and [guitarist] Hillel [Slovak] quit, and we hired these two other guys: Jack Sherman and Cliff Martinez. Both were great musicians, but the connection just wasn’t as profound as we had with the guys we started with. I’ve often wanted to go back and re-record that album, but I can never talk anyone into it.&quot;

==Reception==

The album failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching  201 (meaning it &quot;bubbled under&quot; the main album chart for eight weeks in the autumn of 1984). The album received college airplay and MTV rotation, and built the band&#x27;s fan base. The reviews that were published of the album were mixed, with the first issue of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine giving, according to Anthony Kiedis in his autobiography &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, a positive review. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic later wrote that &quot;their first effort didn&#x27;t quite gel into a cohesive album&quot;. Robert Christgau stated: &quot;As minstrelsy goes, this is good-hearted stuff (and as minstrelsy, it had better be). The reason it doesn&#x27;t quite come off isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s good-hearted, either: the band is outrageous enough, though probably not the way it thinks it is. Perhaps there&#x27;s a clue in this mysterious observation from spokesperson Flea: &#x27;Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow have great raps, but not that great music with it.&#x27; In a bassist, that&#x27;s serious delusion.&quot;

As of 2007, it had sold about 300,000 copies worldwide. Kiedis and Flea have said over the years that they prefer the demo versions of most of the songs, which were recorded with the original lineup featuring Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons; however, the band acknowledged in various books that Jack Sherman&#x27;s contributions to the band, particularly his knowledge of funk music and music theory, were instrumental in the band&#x27;s development that were not present with Slovak. 

Gwen Dickey, better known by her stage name, Rose Norwalt, provides backing vocals on &quot;Mommy Where&#x27;s Daddy?&quot; Dickey was the singer for the 1970s group Rose Royce. On live performances of the song, her lines are performed by Flea.

== Live performances ==
Songs from this album were played live dozens of times throughout the 80s, but nearly all them had left the setlist by the 90s.

As of February 2025, many of the songs from the album have not been performed in decades, with one-off performances of &quot;You Always Sing the Same&quot; in 2011, &quot;Police Helicopter&quot; in 2019, &quot;Mommy Where&#x27;s Daddy?&quot; in 2022, and &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; in 2023.

<doc id="545960" wikidata="Q4723471" url="?curid=545960" title="Alfred State College">
<text>Alfred State College (ASC, SUNY Alfred, SUNY Alfred State) is a public college in Alfred, New York, United States. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. The college offers bachelor&#x27;s and associate degree programs. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and is a member of the Rochester Area Colleges consortium.

== History ==
Both Alfred University and Alfred State have their roots in an early teaching college called the Alfred Select School. The school was visionary in its equal opportunity policy. In 1908 President Boothe C. Davis of Alfred University persuaded the New York State legislature to locate the New York State School of Agriculture at the Alfred University Campus; the resulting allocation of $75,000 for three buildings, a farm, livestock, and machinery would set plans for the school in motion.

In 1937, the School of Engineering Technologies was founded by the original three academic faculty members; Al French, Bill Harrison and Herm Sickler. Four years later, the school was given junior college status and renamed the New York State Agricultural and Technical College at Alfred.

By 1948, the enrollment grew to such large numbers that the state government decided to allow it room to expand, moving the school across Main Street from Alfred University, where it remains today. In addition to a new campus would come greater autonomy, meaning that Alfred would now have two state-funded schools.

==Schools and departments==
Alfred State offers 80 majors in the arts, applied technology, architecture and management and engineering technology. Teaching staff are in a 17:1 ratio to students, and are generally well-educated in their field, while maintaining ties to their profession.

The college is divided into the following schools:

* The School of Arts &amp; Sciences
* The School of Applied Technology (located at the Wellsville campus)
* The School of Architecture, Management and Engineering Technology

==Annual festivals==
In 1972 two Alfred University students started a charity festival titled &quot;Hot Dog Day.&quot; This festival was to be a charity fundraiser for the area. Now held in the third weekend of April, Hot Dog Day is a yearly celebration coordinated through both Alfred University and Alfred State.

Beginning in the fall of 2008, Alfred State began hosting its annual Homecoming and Family Weekend Celebration.

==Student government==
The Student Senate of Alfred State administers over half a million dollars in club and administrative funds through the Student Activity Fee. Student Senate supports, facilitates, and leads its clubs and organizations through an annual Leadership Retreat, weekly leadership seminars, and special projects. In addition to funding, Student Senate allows students of both Wellsville and Alfred main campus to participate in collaborative decision-making processes. The Student Senate General Assembly has voting rights on the board of trustees of the college, known as the College Council, through its College Council Representative. The Student Senate General Assembly also has a voice on the Faculty Senate with a non-voting member but has voting members on many committees including the Academic Affairs Committee. They also have three members on the Auxiliary Campus Enterprises and Services board of directors.

==Facilities and construction==
Founded with three buildings, a farm, and some livestock, Alfred State has expanded to include 13 residence halls, state-of-the-art smart classrooms, a motorsports facility, an organic farm, the Orvis Activities Center, as well as a second campus of Applied Technology located in Wellsville, New York.

Pioneer Stadium accommodates soccer and football, and is surrounded by an eight-lane running track. Facilities also include a Central Dining Hall, a 150-bed townhouse complex, an Engineering Technology Building, and a Student Leadership Center.

==Greek life==
Six fraternities and six sororities are recognized by the college and Greek Senate: Pi Rho Zeta (ΠΡΖ) Fraternity Mu Theta (ΜΘ) fraternity, Psi Sigma Psi (ΨΣΨ) sorority, Alpha Beta Chi (ABX) sorority, Pi Nu Epsilon (ΠΝΕ) sorority, Delta Chi Omega (ΔΧΩ) sorority, and Zeta Psi Omega (ΖΨΩ) sorority are all fully recognized by the college.

Greek Senate has developed an autonomous Greek Judicial Board which allows for the full self-governance of the Alfred Greek System, adjudicating cases of organizational misconduct.

==Museums and galleries==
The Brent Llewellyn Art Gallery at SUNY Alfred State in Alfred, New York, founded in 2010, is located in the campus Engineering Technology Building.

==Athletics==
Alfred State athletic teams are the Pioneers. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) for most of its sponsored sports since the 2019–20 academic year. The Pioneers also compete as a member of the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference, the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference (ECFC) for football, the Colonial States Athletic Conference (CSAC) for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and the Empire Collegiate Wrestling Conference (ECWC) for wrestling. They also previously competed in the short-lived American Collegiate Athletic Association (ACAA) from 2017–18 to 2018–19; and as an NCAA D-III Independent from 2013–14 to 2016–17.

Alfred State competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

Throughout its athletics history, the college was a longtime member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), primarily competing in the Western New York Athletic Conference (WNYAC) until after the 2012–13 school year. The NCAA Division III Management Council announced in April 2013 that Alfred State has been accepted as provisional members. The announcement moved Alfred State into NCAA Division III competition, effective in the 2013–14 school year. Alfred State became a full member of Division III of the NCAA in the summer of 2018.

<text>The blue-faced malkoha (Phaenicophaeus viridirostris) or small green-billed malkoha, is a non-parasitic cuckoo found in the scrub and deciduous forests of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. It has a waxy, dark, blue-grey plumage on its upperparts and has a long tail with graduated white-tipped feathers. The throat and chin are dark with spiny pale feathers that are branched. The lower belly is a dull creamy to rufous colour. The bill is apple green, and a naked patch of blue skin surrounds the eye. The sexes are alike. The blue-faced malkoha is a bird of open forests and scrub jungle.

== Description ==

A largish species at 39 cm, its back and head are dark grey with an oily green or blue gloss, and the dark tail has graduated feathers tipped with white. The belly is pale ochre to grey. The feathers of the chin and throat are branched (unlike in &quot;Phaenicophaeus tristis&quot;) with the branched tips being pointed and slightly yellowish giving the throat a streaked and spiny appearance. There is a large blue patch around the eye, with a white fringed red iris, and the bill is apple green. The sexes are indistinguishable by external appearance. Birds from Sri Lanka have a broader white tip to the tail feathers. Malkohas are generally very silent but will sometimes produce a low croaky &quot;kraa&quot; when flushed. Young birds have dull and non glossy upperparts and some brown feathers in their wing.

They nest within a thorny bush, building a thick platform of twigs lined with green leaves and lay a clutch of two, rarely three, chalky white eggs. The breeding season is somewhat extended and unclear but many nest have been taken from March to August. Two out of 31 specimens trapped in a study were found to have ticks of the genus &quot;Haemaphysalis spinigera&quot;.
The blue-faced malkoha takes a variety of insects, caterpillars and small vertebrates. It usually forages in the undergrowth.

== Taxonomy ==

The species was described in 1840 by T.C. Jerdon based on a specimen that he collected at the base of Coonoor ghats. He placed it in the genus &quot;Zanclostomus&quot; but saw affinities to &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot;. A year earlier T.C. Eyton described a species from Malaya that he called &quot;Phaenicophaeus viridirostris&quot; but that referred to a female of the already described &quot;Phaenicophaeus chlorophaeus&quot;. The species is included in the genus &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot; although it was formerly placed in &quot;Rhopodytes&quot; as the two genera were separated on the basis of the shape of the nostril, round in &quot;Rhopodytes&quot; and slit in &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot; but &quot;Rhopodytes&quot; was subsequently subsumed into the older genus name &quot;Phaenicophaeus&quot;. A study of the aortic arches of birds found that this species has a peculiar modification in the two dorsal carotids are reduced to paired ligaments &quot;ligamenti ottleyi&quot; which enter the hypapophysial canal. The genus is placed in the subfamily Phaenicophaeinae.

==Distribution ==
The blue-faced malkoha is found in peninsular India south of Baroda (the Surat Dangs) and Cuttack in a range of habitats from semi-evergreen, dry deciduous and open scrub forest. In Sri Lanka it is restricted to the plains.
This bird has been recorded in Trichy district of Tamilnadu, india

<text>Vyacheslav Valerianovich Mescherin (30 June 1923 – 6 October 1995) was a Soviet and Russian musician and composer, founder of Vyacheslav Mescherin&#x27;s Orchestra of Electronic Instruments that performed space age pop and easy listening music.

==Biography==
A veteran of World War II, Vyacheslav received Order of the Red Star and Medal &quot;For Courage&quot;. After the war, Mescherin graduated from Gnessin State Musical College and worked on the radio. In 1957 he founded the Orchestra of Electronic Instruments, also informally known as the Vyacheslav Mescherin Orchestra. The orchestra used various electronic instruments, such as theremins, electronic organs and early synthesisers. Vyacheslav composed some of the music, but also arranged electronic versions of folk tunes and Western songs, such as Bimbo Jet and Popcorn.

Initial critical reaction in conservative Soviet media was mixed; a newspaper parody article joked that &quot;Mescherin makes clothes irons play Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Concerto No. 1&quot;. But with time, Mescherin conquered a wider fan base and received many state awards, including the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the RSFSR. Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space, was a fan of the Orchestra. Alexey Leonov stated: &quot;The music of electric musical instruments perfectly corresponds to the state that I experienced in outer space. Mescherin&#x27;s music was often used as a background in elevators and waiting halls, as well as on television. Many of his compositions were included in popular animated series &quot;Well, Just You Wait!&quot; and the 1959 science fiction film &quot;Nebo Zovyot&quot;. The Mescherin Orchestra remained active until 1990.

The Vyacheslav Mescherin Orchestra had produced over 1,000 music tracks, all of which are archived in the old Soviet Sound Recording Museum in Moscow. Mescherin&#x27;s music has been collected in two albums entitled &quot;Easy USSR&quot; Volumes I and II (1960s and 1970s, and 1970s and 1980s, respectively), which became the subject of the BBC Radio 4 documentary &quot;Tim Key&#x27;s Easy USSR&quot; in which Tim Key explains his obsession with Mescherin’s music.
