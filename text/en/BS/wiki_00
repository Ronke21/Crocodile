<text>Energy development is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include the production of renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuel derived sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted. Energy conservation and efficiency measures reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to environmental issues.

Societies use energy for transportation, manufacturing, illumination, heating and air conditioning, and communication, for industrial, commercial, agricultural and domestic purposes. Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, where the resource can be used in substantially its original form, or as secondary resources, where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form. Non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use, whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation.

Thousands of people are employed in the energy industry. The conventional industry comprises the petroleum industry, the natural gas industry, the electrical power industry, and the nuclear industry. New energy industries include the renewable energy industry, comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture, distribution, and sale of alternative fuels.

== Classification of resources ==


Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, suitable for end use without conversion to another form, or secondary resources, where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source. Examples of primary energy resources are wind power, solar power, wood fuel, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and uranium. Secondary resources are those such as electricity, hydrogen, or other synthetic fuels.

Another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource. &quot;Renewable resources&quot; are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands. Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes. An example of a non-renewable energy source is coal, which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use.

== Fossil fuels ==

Fossil fuel (&quot;primary non-renewable fossil&quot;) sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Another fossil fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas. Heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating, or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles, industrial processes, or electrical power generation. These fossil fuels are part of the carbon cycle and allow solar energy stored in the fuel to be released.

The use of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th century set the stage for the Industrial Revolution.

Fossil fuels make up the bulk of the world&#x27;s current primary energy sources. In 2005, 81% of the world&#x27;s energy needs was met from fossil sources. The technology and infrastructure for the use of fossil fuels already exist. Liquid fuels derived from petroleum deliver much usable energy per unit of weight or volume, which is advantageous when compared with lower energy density sources such as batteries. Fossil fuels are currently economical for decentralized energy use.

Energy dependence on imported fossil fuels creates energy security risks for dependent countries. Oil dependence in particular has led to war, funding of radicals, monopolization, and socio-political instability.

Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources, which will eventually decline in production and become exhausted. While the processes that created fossil fuels are ongoing, fuels are consumed far more quickly than the natural rate of replenishment. Extracting fuels becomes increasingly costly as society consumes the most accessible fuel deposits. Extraction of fossil fuels results in environmental degradation, such as the strip mining and mountaintop removal for coal.

Fuel efficiency is a form of thermal efficiency, meaning the efficiency of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work. The fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle, is given as a ratio of distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed. Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for freight, and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency) per passenger. The inefficient atmospheric combustion (burning) of fossil fuels in vehicles, buildings, and power plants contributes to urban heat islands.

Conventional production of oil peaked, conservatively, between 2007 and 2010. In 2010, it was estimated that an investment of $8 trillion in non-renewable resources would be required to maintain current levels of production for 25 years. In 2010, governments subsidized fossil fuels by an estimated $500 billion a year. Fossil fuels are also a source of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to concerns about global warming if consumption is not reduced.

The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of pollution into the atmosphere. The fossil fuels are mainly carbon compounds. During combustion, carbon dioxide is released, and also nitrogen oxides, soot and other fine particulates. The carbon dioxide is the main contributor to recent climate change.
Other emissions from fossil fuel power station include sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds (VOC), mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals including traces of uranium.

A typical coal plant generates billions of kilowatt hours of electrical power per year.

== Nuclear ==
=== Fission ===

Nuclear power is the use of nuclear fission to generate useful heat and electricity. Fission of uranium produces nearly all economically significant nuclear power. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators form a very small component of energy generation, mostly in specialized applications such as deep space vehicles.

Nuclear power plants, excluding naval reactors, provided about 5.7% of the world&#x27;s energy and 13% of the world&#x27;s electricity in 2012.

In 2013, the IAEA report that there are 437 operational nuclear power reactors, in 31 countries, although not every reactor is producing electricity. In addition, there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation, powered by some 180 reactors. As of 2013, attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion reactions, excluding natural fusion power sources such as the Sun, remains an ongoing area of international physics and engineering research. More than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial fusion power production remains unlikely before 2050.
There is an ongoing debate about nuclear power. Proponents, such as the World Nuclear Association, the IAEA and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy contend that nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions. Opponents contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.
Nuclear power plant accidents include the Chernobyl disaster (1986), Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), and the Three Mile Island accident (1979). There have also been some nuclear submarine accidents. In terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated, analysis has determined that nuclear power has caused less fatalities per unit of energy generated than the other major sources of energy generation. Energy production from coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydropower has caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accident effects. However, the economic costs of nuclear power accidents is high, and meltdowns can take decades to clean up. The human costs of evacuations of affected populations and lost livelihoods is also significant.

Comparing Nuclear&#x27;s &quot;latent&quot; cancer deaths, such as cancer with other energy sources &quot;immediate&quot; deaths per unit of energy generated(GWeyr). This study does not include fossil fuel related cancer and other indirect deaths created by the use of fossil fuel consumption in its &quot;severe accident&quot; classification, which would be an accident with more than 5 fatalities.
As of 2012, according to the IAEA, worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries, approximately 28 of which in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), with the most recent nuclear power reactor, as of May 2013, to be connected to the electrical grid, occurring on February 17, 2013, in Hongyanhe Nuclear Power Plant in the PRC. In the United States, two new Generation III reactors are under construction at Vogtle. U.S. nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020, all at existing plants. In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed.

Recent experiments in extraction of uranium use polymer ropes that are coated with a substance that selectively absorbs uranium from seawater. This process could make the considerable volume of uranium dissolved in seawater exploitable for energy production. Since ongoing geologic processes carry uranium to the sea in amounts comparable to the amount that would be extracted by this process, in a sense the sea-borne uranium becomes a sustainable resource.

Nuclear power is a low carbon power generation method of producing electricity, with an analysis of the literature on its total life cycle emission intensity finding that it is similar to renewable sources in a comparison of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy generated. Since the 1970s, nuclear fuel has displaced about 64 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2-eq) greenhouse gases, that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of oil, coal or natural gas in fossil-fuel power stations.

==== Nuclear power phase-out and pull-backs ====

Japan&#x27;s 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, which occurred in a reactor design from the 1960s, prompted a rethink of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries. Germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022, and Italy has banned nuclear power. Following Fukushima, in 2011 the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.

===== Fukushima =====
Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster – the second worst nuclear incident, that displaced 50,000 households after radioactive material leaked into the air, soil and sea, and with subsequent radiation checks leading to bans on some shipments of vegetables and fish – a global public support survey by Ipsos (2011) for energy sources was published and nuclear fission was found to be the least popular

==== Fission economics ====

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs. In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks. In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.

==== Costs ====
Costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats. While first of their kind designs, such as the EPRs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget, of the seven South Korean APR-1400s presently under construction worldwide, two are in S.Korea at the Hanul Nuclear Power Plant and four are at the largest nuclear station construction project in the world as of 2016, in the United Arab Emirates at the planned Barakah nuclear power plant. The first reactor, Barakah-1 is 85% completed and on schedule for grid-connection during 2017. 
Two of the four EPRs under construction (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost.

== Renewable sources ==

Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services.

Including traditional biomass usage, about 19% of global energy consumption is accounted for by renewable resources. Wind powered energy production is being turned to as a prominent renewable energy source, increasing global wind power capacity by 12% in 2021. While not the case for all countries, 58% of sample countries linked renewable energy consumption to have a positive impact on economic growth. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.[76]

Unlike other energy sources, renewable energy sources are not as restricted by geography. Additionally deployment of renewable energy is resulting in economic benefits as well as combating climate change. Rural electrification has been researched on multiple sites and positive effects on commercial spending, appliance use, and general activities requiring electricity as energy. Renewable energy growth in at least 38 countries has been driven by the high electricity usage rates. International support for promoting renewable sources like solar and wind have continued grow.

While many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development. To ensure human development continues sustainably, governments around the world are beginning to research potential ways to implement renewable sources into their countries and economies. For example, the UK Government’s Department for Energy and Climate Change 2050 Pathways created a mapping technique to educate the public on land competition between energy supply technologies. This tool provides users the ability to understand what the limitations and potential their surrounding land and country has in terms of energy production.

=== Hydroelectricity ===

Hydroelectricity is electric power generated by hydropower; the force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world&#x27;s total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the following 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela.

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered energy plants.

=== Wind ===
Wind power harnesses the power of the wind to propel the blades of wind turbines. These turbines cause the rotation of magnets, which creates electricity. Wind towers are usually built together on wind farms. There are offshore and onshore wind farms. Global wind power capacity has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and wind energy production was around 4% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing rapidly.

Wind power is widely used in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Several countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration, such as 21% of stationary electricity production in Denmark, 18% in Portugal, 16% in Spain, 14% in Ireland, and 9% in Germany in 2010. By 2011, at times over 50% of electricity in Germany and Spain came from wind and solar power. As of 2011, 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.

Many of the world&#x27;s largest onshore wind farms are located in the United States, China, and India. Most of the world&#x27;s largest offshore wind farms are located in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. The two largest offshore wind farm are currently the 630 MW London Array and Gwynt y Môr.

=== Solar ===
=== Biofuels ===

A biofuel is a fuel that contains energy from geologically recent carbon fixation. These fuels are produced from living organisms. Examples of this carbon fixation occur in plants and microalgae. These fuels are made by a biomass conversion (biomass refers to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can be used for biofuels. Biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising oil prices and the need for energy security.

Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn or sugarcane. Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the USA and in Brazil. Current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. However, research is underway on producing renewable fuels from decarboxylation

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world&#x27;s fuels for road transport, a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodiesel. Global ethanol fuel production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world&#x27;s top producers, accounting together for 90% of global production. The world&#x27;s largest biodiesel producer is the European Union, accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010. As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces. The International Energy Agency has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.

=== Geothermal ===

Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth&#x27;s crust originates from the original formation of the planet (20%) and from radioactive decay of minerals (80%). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective &quot;geothermal&quot; originates from the Greek roots &quot;γη (ge)&quot;, meaning earth, and &quot;θερμος (thermos)&quot;, meaning hot.

Earth&#x27;s internal heat is thermal energy generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth&#x27;s formation. Temperatures at the core-mantle boundary may reach over 4000 °C (7,200 °F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth&#x27;s interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in portions of mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370 °C (700 °F).

From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for electricity generation. Worldwide, 11,400 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries in 2012. An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications in 2010.

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

The Earth&#x27;s geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity&#x27;s energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB&#x27;s customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal. But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25% over the past two decades. In 2001, geothermal energy cost between two and ten US cents per kWh.

=== Oceanic ===

Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) or marine power (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy, ocean power, or marine and hydrokinetic energy) refers to the energy carried by the mechanical energy of ocean waves, currents, and tides, shifts in salinity gradients, and ocean temperature differences. MRE has the potential to become a reliable and renewable energy source because of the cyclical nature of the oceans. The movement of water in the world&#x27;s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport, and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both wave power, i.e. power from surface waves, and tidal power, i.e. obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential to provide a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.

Marine energy technology is in its first stage of development. To be developed, MRE needs efficient methods of storing, transporting, and capturing ocean power, so it can be used where needed. Over the past year, countries around the world have started implementing market strategies for MRE to commercialize. Canada and China introduced incentives, such as feed-in tariffs (FiTs), which are above-market prices for MRE that allow investors and project developers a stable income. Other financial strategies consist of subsidies, grants, and funding from public-private partnerships (PPPs). China alone approved 100 ocean projects in 2019. Portugal and Spain recognize the potential of MRE in accelerating decarbonization, which is fundamental to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. Both countries are focusing on solar and offshore wind auctions to attract private investment, ensure cost-effectiveness, and accelerate MRE growth. Ireland sees MRE as a key component to reduce its carbon footprint. The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) supports the exploration and development of the country&#x27;s significant offshore energy potential. Additionally, Ireland has implemented the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which includes auctions designed to provide financial support for communities, increase technology diversity, and guarantee energy security. 

However, while research is increasing, there have been concerns associated with threats to marine mammals, habitats, and potential changes to ocean currents. MRE can be a renewable energy source for coastal communities helping their transition from fossil fuel, but researchers are calling for a better understanding of its environmental impacts. Because ocean-energy areas are often isolated from both fishing and sea traffic, these zones may provide shelter from humans and predators for some marine species. MRE devices can be an ideal home for many fish, crayfish, mollusks, and barnacles; and may also indirectly affect seabirds, and marine mammals because they feed on those species. Similarly, such areas may create an &quot;artificial reef effect&quot; by boosting biodiversity nearby. Noise pollution generated from the technology is limited, also causing fish and mammals living in the area of the installation to return. In the most recent State of Science Report about MRE, the authors claim that there is no evidence for fish, mammals, or seabirds to be injured by either collision, noise pollution, or the electromagnetic field. The uncertainty of its environmental impact comes from the low quantity of MRE devices in the ocean today where data is collected. 

=== 100% renewable energy ===
The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than anyone anticipated. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Stephen W. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow have developed a series of &quot;stabilization wedges&quot; that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and &quot;renewable energy sources,&quot; in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their &quot;wedges.&quot;

Mark Z. Jacobson says producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be &quot;primarily social and political, not technological or economic&quot;. Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today&#x27;s energy costs.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that &quot;sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs ... Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly larger amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand.&quot; .

Critics of the &quot;100% renewable energy&quot; approach include Vaclav Smil and James E. Hansen. Smil and Hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power, but Amory Lovins argues that the electricity grid can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.

Google spent $30 million on their &quot;Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal&quot; project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.

== Increased energy efficiency ==

Although increasing the efficiency of energy use is not energy development per se, it may be considered under the topic of energy development since it makes existing energy sources available to do work.

Efficient energy use reduces the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing fluorescent lamps or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required for illumination compared to incandescent light bulbs. Compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights. Improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process.

Reducing energy use may save consumers money, if the energy savings offsets the cost of an energy efficient technology. Reducing energy use reduces emissions. According to the International Energy Agency, improved energy efficiency in buildings, industrial processes and transportation could reduce the global energy demand in 2050 to around 8% smaller than today, but serving an economy more than twice as big and a population of about 2  billion more people.

Energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the &quot;twin pillars&quot; of sustainable energy policy. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate at which domestic energy resources are depleted.

It&#x27;s been discovered &quot;that for OECD countries, wind, geothermal, hydro and nuclear have the lowest hazard rates among energy sources in production&quot;.

== Transmission ==

While new sources of energy are only rarely discovered or made possible by new technology, distribution technology continually evolves. The use of fuel cells in cars, for example, is an anticipated delivery technology. This section presents the various delivery technologies that have been important to historic energy development. They all rely in way on the energy sources listed in the previous section.

=== Shipping and pipelines ===

Coal, petroleum and their derivatives are delivered by boat, rail, or road. Petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered by pipeline, and coal via a Slurry pipeline. Fuels such as gasoline and LPG may also be delivered via aircraft. Natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly. The higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive.

=== Wired energy transfer ===

Electricity grids are the networks used to transmit and distribute power from production source to end user, when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away. Sources include electrical generation plants such as a nuclear reactor, coal burning power plant, etc. A combination of sub-stations and transmission lines are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity. Grids may suffer from transient blackouts and brownouts, often due to weather damage. During certain extreme space weather events solar wind can interfere with transmissions. Grids also have a predefined carrying capacity or load that cannot safely be exceeded. When power requirements exceed what&#x27;s available, failures are inevitable. To prevent problems, power is then rationed.

Industrialised countries such as Canada, the US, and Australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world, which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network. The US grid is one of the most advanced, although infrastructure maintenance is becoming a problem. CurrentEnergy provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for California, Texas, and the Northeast of the US. African countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity. One of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of Queensland, Australia.

=== Wireless energy transfer ===

Wireless power transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires. Currently available technology is limited to short distances and relatively low power level.

Orbiting solar power collectors would require wireless transmission of power to Earth. The proposed method involves creating a large beam of microwave-frequency radio waves, which would be aimed at a collector antenna site on the Earth. Formidable technical challenges exist to ensure the safety and profitability of such a scheme.

== Storage ==

Energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store energy to perform useful operation at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator.

All forms of energy are either potential energy (e.g. Chemical, gravitational, electrical energy, temperature differential, latent heat, etc.) or kinetic energy (e.g. momentum). Some technologies provide only short-term energy storage, and others can be very long-term such as power to gas using hydrogen or methane and the storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons in deep aquifers or bedrock. A wind-up clock stores potential energy (in this case mechanical, in the spring tension), a battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone, and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy. Ice storage tanks store ice (thermal energy in the form of latent heat) at night to meet peak demand for cooling. Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Even food (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in chemical form.

== History ==
Since prehistory, when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food, through the Middle Ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat, until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom. Man has sought endlessly for energy sources.

Except nuclear, geothermal and tidal, all other energy sources are from current solar isolation or from fossil remains of plant and animal life that relied upon sunlight. Ultimately, solar energy itself is the result of the Sun&#x27;s nuclear fusion. Geothermal power from hot, hardened rock above the magma of the Earth&#x27;s core is the result of the decay of radioactive materials present beneath the Earth&#x27;s crust, and nuclear fission relies on man-made fission of heavy radioactive elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust; in both cases these elements were produced in supernova explosions before the formation of the Solar System.

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest. In 1865, William Stanley Jevons published &quot;The Coal Question&quot; in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement. In 1914, U.S. Bureau of Mines stated that the total production was . In 1956, Geophysicist M. King Hubbert deduces that U.S. oil production would peak between 1965 and 1970 and that oil production will peak &quot;within half a century&quot; on the basis of 1956 data. In 1989, predicted peak by Colin Campbell In 2004, OPEC estimated, with substantial investments, it would nearly double oil output by 2025

=== Sustainability ===

The environmental movement has emphasized sustainability of energy use and development. Renewable energy is sustainable in its production; the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years. &quot;Sustainability&quot; also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products, especially air pollution. Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are brought up on this point. With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt various energy sources is growing. Energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development. It reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently.

=== Resilience ===

Some observers contend that idea of &quot;energy independence&quot; is an unrealistic and opaque concept. The alternative offer of &quot;energy resilience&quot; is a goal aligned with economic, security, and energy realities. The notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book &quot;Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security&quot;. The authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the often interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of a country. Key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are often centralized and easily susceptible to disruption. They conclude that a &quot;resilient energy supply&quot; is necessary for both national security and the environment. They recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized.

In 2008, former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove looked to energy resilience, arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy. He describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy. To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity. Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is &quot;sticky&quot; – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas. According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as The Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles &quot;en masse&quot; connecting to it to charge their batteries.

=== Present and future ===

Extrapolations from current knowledge to the future offer a choice of energy futures. Predictions parallel the Malthusian catastrophe hypothesis. Numerous are complex models based scenarios as pioneered by &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;. Modeling approaches offer ways to analyze diverse strategies, and hopefully find a road to rapid and sustainable development of humanity. Short term energy crises are also a concern of energy development. Extrapolations lack plausibility, particularly when they predict a continual increase in oil consumption.

Energy production usually requires an energy investment. Drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy. The fossil fuel resources that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert. They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments. If investment is greater than the value of the energy produced by the resource, it is no longer an effective energy source. These resources are no longer an energy source but may be exploited for value as raw materials. New technology may lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded.

Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation. The peaking of world hydrocarbon production (peak oil) may lead to significant changes, and require sustainable methods of production. One vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth&#x27;s surface (i.e., buildings, vehicles and roads) doing artificial photosynthesis (using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer) efficiently than plants.

With contemporary space industry&#x27;s economic activity and the related private spaceflight, with the manufacturing industries, that go into Earth&#x27;s orbit or beyond, delivering them to those regions will require further energy development. Researchers have contemplated space-based solar power for collecting solar power for use on Earth. Space-based solar power has been in research since the early 1970s. Space-based solar power would require construction of collector structures in space. The advantage over ground-based solar power is higher intensity of light, and no weather to interrupt power collection.

==Energy technology==

Energy technology is an interdisciplinary engineering science having to do with the efficient, safe, environmentally friendly, and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage, and use of energy, targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting side effects on humans, nature, and the environment.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need, and as a scarce resource, it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.

Energy is also the capacity to do work. We can get energy from food. Energy can be of different forms such as kinetic, potential, mechanical, heat, light etc. Energy is required for individuals and the whole society for lighting, heating, cooking, running, industries, operating transportation and so forth. Basically there are two types of energy depending on the source s they are;
1.Renewable Energy Sources
2.Non-Renewable Energy Sources

===Interdisciplinary fields===
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.

* Physics, for thermodynamics and nuclear physics
* Chemistry for fuel, combustion, air pollution, flue gas, battery technology and fuel cells.
* Electrical engineering
* Engineering, often for fluid energy machines such as combustion engines, turbines, pumps and compressors.
* Geography, for geothermal energy and exploration for resources.
* Mining, for petrochemical and fossil fuels.
* Agriculture and forestry, for sources of renewable energy.
* Meteorology for wind and solar energy.
* Water and Waterways, for hydropower.
* Waste management, for environmental impact.
* Transportation, for energy-saving transportation systems.
* Environmental studies, for studying the effect of energy use and production on the environment, nature and climate change.
* (Lighting Technology), for Interior and Exterior Natural as well as Artificial Lighting Design, Installations, and Energy Savings
* (Energy Cost/Benefit Analysis), for Simple Payback and Life Cycle Costing of Energy Efficiency/Conservation Measures Recommended

===Electrical engineering===
Electric power engineering deals with the production and use of electrical energy, which can entail the study of machines such as generators, electric motors and transformers. Infrastructure involves substations and transformer stations, power lines and electrical cable. Load management and power management over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. Electric heating is also widely used and researched.

===Thermodynamics===
Thermodynamics deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical Physics.

===Thermal and chemical energy===

Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with chemistry and environmental studies. Combustion has to do with burners and chemical engines of all kinds, grates and incinerators along with their energy efficiency, pollution and operational safety.

Exhaust gas purification technology aims to lessen air pollution through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. Emission control technology is a field of process and chemical engineering. Boiler technology deals with the design, construction and operation of steam boilers and turbines (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from applied mechanics and materials engineering.

Energy conversion has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.
===Nuclear energy===

Nuclear technology deals with nuclear power production from nuclear reactors, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry and radiation science.

Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through nuclear fission is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that fusion technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of nuclear physics.

===Renewable energy===
Renewable energy has many branches.

====Wind power====

Wind turbines convert wind energy into electricity by connecting a spinning rotor to a generator. Wind turbines draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using aerodynamics along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering. The wind passes across the aerodynamic rotor blades, creating an area of higher pressure and an area of lower pressure on either side of the blade. The forces of lift and drag are formed due to the difference in air pressure. The lift force is stronger than the drag force; therefore the rotor, which is connected to a generator, spins. The energy is then created due to the change from the aerodynamic force to the rotation of the generator.

Being recognized as one of the most efficient renewable energy sources, wind power is becoming more and more relevant and used in the world. Wind power does not use any water in the production of energy making it a good source of energy for areas without much water. Wind energy could also be produced even if the climate changes in line with current predictions, as it relies solely on wind.

====Geothermal====
Deep within the  Earth, is an extreme heat producing layer of molten rock called magma. The very high temperatures from the magma heats nearby groundwater. There are various technologies that have been developed in order to benefit from such heat, such as using different types of power plants (dry, flash or binary), heat pumps, or wells. These processes of harnessing the heat incorporate an infrastructure which has in one form or another a turbine which is spun by either the hot water or the steam produced by it. The spinning turbine, being connected to a generator, produces energy. A more recent innovation involves the use of shallow closed-loop systems that pump heat to and from structures by taking advantage of the constant temperature of soil around 10 feet deep.

====Hydropower====

Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, ocean waves and tides. Civil engineering is used to study and build dams, tunnels, waterways and manage coastal resources through hydrology and geology. A low speed water turbine spun by flowing water can power an electrical generator to produce electricity.

====Bioenergy====

Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, agriculture and forestry from which power plants can draw burning fuel. Ethanol, methanol (both controversial) or hydrogen for fuel cells can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.

====Enabling technologies====

Heat pumps and Thermal energy storage are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to interseasonal, and can involve storage of sensible energy (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or latent energy (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter&#x27;s cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The Drake Landing Solar Community (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer. Types of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks, borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock, deep aquifers, or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top. Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a heat pump. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called phase-change materials (PCMs).

<doc id="533492" wikidata="Q1403103" url="?curid=533492" title="Nafarroa Bai">
<text>Nafarroa Bai () was a Navarrese coalition in Spain of Basque nationalist and regional left-wing parties created in 2004 for the Spanish General election.

==History==
The coalition comprised Aralar, the Basque Nationalist Party, Eusko Alkartasuna (Basque Solidarity), Batzarre, and local independents, but not the outlawed Basque nationalists of Batasuna or Accion Nacionalista Vasca (ANV), traditionally the Basque nationalist party in Navarre with strongest support, for its stance on ETA&#x27;s violence.

All these parties usually ran by themselves competing with each other at elections held in the neighbouring autonomous community of the Basque country but agreed to run together in Navarre. Basque nationalism does not hold a majority there, and the move was aimed at optimizing the Basque nationalist electoral results in Navarre. The coalition came up third and won a seat in the Spanish Parliament in 2004, gaining 18.4% of the votes cast in Navarre.

In 2007 the coalition became the second largest political force in Navarre&#x27;s autonomous parliament, virtually tied with the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSN–PSOE) by obtaining 23.7% of the votes cast and 12 seats. Five of the seats belonged to Aralar, four to EA and one for each the PNV and Batzarre, another one is independent.
Its most significant politicians were Patxi Zabaleta (Aralar), Maiorga Ramírez (Eusko Alkartasuna) and Uxue Barkos, a respected journalist who had worked for the Basque Television. She was the coalition&#x27;s only MP in the Spanish Parliament.

In the 2008 Spanish General Election, Nafarroa Bai repeated the results of 2004 (18.5%), again coming up third in the autonomous community and repeating its only seat in the Spanish Parliament.

By 2011, new parties and coalitions jumped onto the political scene on the eve of the votation campaign after tribunals in Madrid decided on their legalization. The coalition then broke up when Eusko Alkartasuna and Aralar left it, and the leftovers of the coalition revamped as Geroa Bai, this time participated only by PNV and other minor groups, and led by Uxue Barkos.

<text>Chelsea College of Arts is a constituent college of the University of the Arts London, a public art and design university in London, England.

It offers further and higher education courses in fine art, graphic design, interior design, product design, and textile design up to PhD level.

==History==
===Polytechnic===
Chelsea College of Arts was originally an integral school of the South-Western Polytechnic, which opened at Manresa Road, Chelsea, in 1895 to provide scientific and technical education to Londoners. Day and evening classes for men and women were held for the domestic economy, mathematics, engineering, natural science, art, and music. Art was taught from the beginning of the Polytechnic and included design, weaving, embroidery, and electrodeposition. The South-Western Polytechnic became the Chelsea Polytechnic in 1922 and taught a growing number of registered students at the University of London.

At the beginning of the 1930s, the School of Art began to widen, including courses in craft training and commercial design from 1931. H.S Williamson, the school&#x27;s appointed headmaster from 1930 to 1958, introduced sculpture shortly after World War II. Notable artists from this period were employed as teachers such as Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland. Alumni from this period included Elisabeth Frink, Edward Burra, Patrick Caulfield, Ethel Walker, Dirk Bogarde, Robert Clatworthy, John Latham, and John Berger.

The School of Science separated and became known as the Chelsea College of Science and Technology in 1957, and was later admitted as a constituent College of the University of London in 1966. The Chelsea College of Science and Technology was granted its royal charter in 1971 and merged with King&#x27;s College London and Queen Elizabeth College in 1985.

===Chelsea School of Art===
The School of Art merged with the Hammersmith School of Art, founded by Francis Hawke, to form the Chelsea School of Art in 1908. The newly formed school was taken over by the London County Council and a new building was erected at Lime Grove, which opened with an extended curriculum. A trade school for girls was erected on the same site in 1914.
The school acquired premises at Great Titchfield Street, and was jointly accommodated with Quintin Hogg&#x27;s Polytechnic in Regent Street (a forerunner of the University of Westminster). The campus at Manresa Road introduced painting and graphic design in 1963, with both disciplines being particularly successful. 

Lawrence Gowing, painter and art historian, was appointed as the first principal of the Chelsea School of Art. He was responsible for the integration of history and theory with practice, employing artists rather than art historians to teach art history and theory. This approach remains intrinsic to Chelsea&#x27;s teaching philosophy today.

Under Gowing, an option program was introduced, which encompassed workshops in experimental music, poetry, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and anthropology. A basic design course, pioneered by Victor Pasmore and Richard Hamilton, was also developed during the same period, becoming the basis of the college&#x27;s current foundation course in art and design.

Professor William Callaway (Head of the School from 1989 to 1992), Colin Cina (appointed Dean of School of Art), and Bridget Jackson (Dean of the School of Design) reformed the school and ensured the redevelopment of the entire academic program, introducing courses at multiple levels from HND to accredited honors and postgraduate degrees. Initially, these were validated by the UK Council for National Academic Awards; i.e. in the short period before the London Institute gained degree-awarding powers. Bridget Jackson was appointed Head of the College in 1993, retiring in 1997 to be succeeded by Professor Colin Cina who led the college until his retirement in 2003.

===London Institute===
The Chelsea School of Art became a constituent College of the London Institute in 1986, formed by the Inner London Education Authority to associate London&#x27;s art, design, fashion, and media schools into a collegiate structure. The school was renamed Chelsea College of Art and Design in 1989. The London Institute was granted University status and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004. In 2013, the college was renamed Chelsea College of Arts.

In 2002–2003, Professor Roger Wilson was appointed as the Head of College until his retirement in 2006. He led the relocation to the listed Royal Army Medical College, renovated as a purpose-built art college by the architects Allies and Morrison in 2005. With this move, the Chelsea College of Arts presently resides next to Tate Britain at Millbank, returning to one standalone campus.

==Exhibition spaces==
The college comprises three notable on-site exhibition spaces:

#Chelsea Space is an international and interdisciplinary platform for professional practitioners to exhibit experimental curatorial projects. The gallery also releases regular publications from participating authors, artists, and designers.
#The Parade Ground, situated within the college, has been transformed into London&#x27;s largest open-air gallery hosting events from film screenings to large-scale installations in the spring of 2008. The exhibition ground had previously been used for students and professionals as an open area platform, notably for artist Chris Burden&#x27;s &#x27;A Flying Steamroller&#x27; in 2006. Recent exhibitions include Cildo Meireles&#x27;s &#x27;Occasion&#x27;, held in association with his exhibition at Tate Modern in 2008.
#The Triangle Space, about its name, has been designed as a modern angular-shaped space for students to show their work throughout the year.

==Research==
The college organises its research activities in partnership with Camberwell College of Arts and Wimbledon College of Arts hosts a variety of research centres, groups and clusters:
# International Centre for Fine Art Research (ICFAR)
# Transnational Art, Identity and Nation (TrAIN)
# Critical Practice Chelsea
# FADE (Fine Art Digital Environment)
# Textiles, Environment, Design (TED)

==Affiliations==
Chelsea is a constituent college of the University of the Arts London, with Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins, London College of Communication, London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of Arts. The college also has exchange links with the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, US.

==Other==
===CLIP CETL===
Chelsea and the London College of Fashion share the &#x27;Creative Learning in Practice Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning&#x27; (CLIP CETL). The centre is funded by the British government in recognition of the two colleges&#x27; excellent results in developing student learning.

<text>Sion (; IAST: &quot;Śīv&quot; ) is a neighbourhood of Mumbai. In the 17th century the village formed the boundary between Mumbai and Salsette Island. The British named it marking the end of the city. The name remained even after Mumbai was joined to the Salsette and extended up to Mulund. One of the local historical places in Sion is a hilltop garden commonly known as Sion Fort or Sheevon Killa in the Marathi language.

== History ==
In 1543, the Portuguese took possession of the largely uninhabited islands of Bombay, naming it Sião, after a biblical hill in Israel. The Portuguese gave the Jesuit priests the sole ownership of some of these islands. The Jesuits then built a chapel on the hill near the present-day railway station and named it after Mount Zion (Sion) in Jerusalem.

== Education ==
Sion is also a home to many educational institutes, including:

<doc id="533499" wikidata="Q564763" url="?curid=533499" title="Anne Jean Marie René Savary">
<text>Anne Jean Marie René Savary, 1st duc de Rovigo (26 April 17742 June 1833) was a French military officer and diplomat who served in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic Wars and the French invasion of Algeria. He was Minister of Police between 1810 and 1814.

==Early life and career==
Savary was born in Marcq, Ardennes. He was educated at the college of St Louis in Metz and joined the royal army in 1790. His first military campaign was in 1792, under General Custine, against the retreating forces led by the Duke of Brunswick. He subsequently served under Pichegru and Moreau and distinguished himself during Moreau&#x27;s strategic retreat from Swabia. In 1797, he was appointed chef d&#x27;escadron and participated in the Egyptian campaign under General Louis Desaix. He published an account of this campaign in his memoirs.

Savary fought in the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800, where he served alongside Desaix. Following Desaix&#x27;s death in battle, Savary caught the attention of the First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, and he was appointed commander of the Elite Gendarmes of the Consular Guard. Savary played a role in uncovering the details of the Georges Cadoudal–Pichegru conspiracy in 1804. He ventured to the cliffs of Biville in Normandy, a landing spot for the conspirators, and attempted to lure the Comte d&#x27;Artois (later known as Charles X) to land by mimicking signals used by the royalist plotters. However, his efforts were unsuccessful.

During his tenure as commanding officer at Vincennes, Savary became embroiled in controversy due to the summary execution of the Duc d&#x27;Enghien. Hulin, the presiding officer at the court-martial, later accused Savary of obstructing his attempts to appeal for mercy to Bonaparte. According to Hulin, Savary intervened when Hulin was drafting the appeal. Although Savary denied these allegations, his denial has not been widely accepted by historians.

==Napoleonic Wars==

In February 1805, Savary was promoted to general of division. Shortly before the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, Napoleon dispatched him with a message to emperor Alexander I, requesting an armistice. This maneuver only motivated the Russian monarch to strike a decisive blow, leading to disaster for the Russians. After the battle, Savary once again conveyed a message to Alexander, persuading him to negotiate a truce.

During the 1806 campaign, Savary boldly pursued the Prussians after the Battle of Jena. He also negotiated during the &quot;Siege of Hameln&quot;. At the beginning of the following year, he assumed command of a corps and achieved a victory at Ostrolenka on 16 February 1807.
After the Treaty of Tilsit was signed on 7 July 1807, Savary traveled to St. Petersburg as the French ambassador. He was soon replaced by General Caulaincourt, another individual involved in the execution of the duc d&#x27;Enghien. It is said that the empress dowager&#x27;s aversion to Savary played a role in his recall. It is thought more likely that Napoleon required his scheming abilities for his Spanish campaign towards the end of 1807. Honoured with the title of Duke of Rovigo (&quot;duc de Rovigo&quot;), named after a small town in Venetia, Savary departed for Madrid when Napoleon&#x27;s plans for exerting control over Spain were nearing completion. Working alongside Murat, Savary exploited the divisions within the Spanish royal family in March and April of 1808. He convinced Charles IV of Spain, who had recently surrendered under duress, and his son Ferdinand VII, the &quot;de facto&quot; king of Spain, to submit their claims to Napoleon. Savary persuaded Ferdinand to cross the Pyrenees and proceed to Bayonne, a decision that cost Ferdinand his crown and his freedom until 1814.

In September 1808, Savary accompanied the emperor to the meeting at the Congress of Erfurt with Alexander I, and in 1809 he participated in the campaign against Austria.

Following Fouché&#x27;s disgrace in the spring of 1810, Savary became Minister of Police. He transformed the office into an inquisition, in contrast to the leniency under the Jacobin Fouché. Notable incidents during his tenure included carrying out Napoleon&#x27;s order to exile Madame de Staël and destroy her work &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot;. However, Savary&#x27;s vigilance failed him during the peculiar conspiracy of General Malet. Two of Malet&#x27;s accomplices apprehended Savary in his sleep, briefly imprisoning him for a few hours on 23 October 1812. This event brought ridicule upon Savary, tarnishing his reputation. As a token of appreciation, Napoleon granted him duché grand-fief of Rovigo within his Kingdom of Italy, a rare hereditary honor, which ceased to exist in 1872.

==Hundred days, imprisonment, in exile and a final command in Algeria==

Savary was among the last to desert Napoleon following his abdication on 11 April 1814, and among the first to welcome his return from Elba in 1815 during the hundred days. During this period, Savary was inspector-general of the gendarmerie and a peer of France. Following the Battle of Waterloo, he accompanied Napoleon to Rochefort and sailed with him to Plymouth aboard HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. Savary was not allowed to accompany Napoleon to Saint Helena, but was interned for several months in Malta. After escaping, he traveled to Smyrna where he settled for a while, before eventually being allowed to return to France. Later, he settled in Rome. 

In 1830, Savary came back into favour following the July Revolution, and in 1831, assumed command of the French army in Algeria. In Algiers, he antagonized French civil authorities with his authoritarian treatment of Arabs with disregard for Algerians’ religious beliefs. In spite of protests, the Ketchaoua Mosque was confiscated in December 1831 and consecrated as the cathedral of Saint Philippe on Christmas Day, 1832.

He was also responsible for the massacre of the local El Ouffia tribe alongside Maximilien Joseph Schauenburg and the deaths of several Arab leaders whom he lured into negotiations.

While he was not the first military governor of French possessions in Algeria he was the one who introduced extreme violence into the occupation and pacification of Algiers on a scale not seen before him. 

== Personal life ==
Comtesse du Cayla was said to be a mistress of Savary and to have even born him a son.

His failing health meant that he returned to France, where he died in Paris in June 1833.

<doc id="533500" wikidata="Q4324578" url="?curid=533500" title="Russian submarine Novomoskovsk (K-407)">
<text>K-407&quot; Novomoskovsk&quot; is a Project 667BDRM &quot;Delfin&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine (NATO reporting name Delta IV) of the Russian Navy&#x27;s Northern Fleet.

==Background==
Construction of the nuclear submarine &quot;K-407&quot; &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; began at the Northern Machinebuilding Enterprise (Sevmash) in Severodvinsk on 2 February 1987, and it became part of the Soviet Navy on 27 November 1990. She was the last of seven 667BDRM &quot;Delfin&quot; submarines and the last SSBN submarine built in the USSR. This class of submarines was developed at the Rubin Design Bureau in 1975 and is considered one of the most successful Soviet submarine missile carrier designs.

==Specification==

The submarine has a submerged displacement of 18,200 tons and a surface displacement of 11,700 tons. It is long and wide. It is powered by two nuclear reactors with a total power of . The submarine&#x27;s immersion depth is ; its surface speed is , and its underwater speed is . It carries a crew of 135. Armaments include a D-9RM missile system (16 RSM-54 ballistic missiles) and four torpedo tubes.
The RSM-54 missile (3M37, R-29RM, or SS-N-23 according to the NATO classification) is a liquid-propellant, three-stage missile with separable heads (it carries four or ten warheads depending on the modification). It has a range of , a CEP of , and a launching mass of 40.3 tons. It is long and in diameter.

==History==
On 6 August 1991 at 21:09 &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;, under the command of Captain Second Rank Sergey Yegorov, became the world&#x27;s only submarine to successfully launch an all-missile salvo, launching 16 ballistic missiles (RSM-54) of total weight of almost 700 tons at an interval of several seconds (operation code name &quot;Behemoth-2&quot;). The first and the last missiles hit their targets successfully, while the others were self-destroyed in the air according to the plan. This operation was considered by the Soviet Navy as a part of possible nuclear war scenario (&quot;Dress rehearsal of the Apocalypse&quot;) and experimentally confirmed the technical possibility of a safe underwater all-missile salvo. Politically, the Soviet ballistic missile submarines passed a reasonability check as a part of strategic triad. The previous attempt of an all-missile salvo (operation code name &quot;Behemoth&quot;) was performed in 1989 and finished unsuccessfully, however with no casualties. As the experiment took place just before the August Putsch in the USSR, its results were forgotten for a while, and the crew&#x27;s work wasn&#x27;t rewarded by the Soviet government authorities.

On 19 March 1993, &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;, under the command of Captain First Rank Andrey Bulgakov, collided with . The American submarine was trailing the Russian submarine and miscalculated its speed. Both submarines returned to their homeports, and though badly damaged both returned to service. &quot;Grayling&quot; was decommissioned in 1997, while &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; remains in service 30 years later.

In 1996, &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;, together with the submarine , successfully fired a batch of ballistic missiles. The city of Novomoskovsk in Tula Oblast took the submarine under its patronage, and on June 19, 1997, &quot;K-407&quot; received the name &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;.

On 7 July 1998, &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;, under the command of Captain 1st Rank Aleksandr Moiseyev, launched a Shtil-1 carrier rocket with two German scientific Tubsat-N and Tubsat-N1 microsatellites while submerged in the Barents Sea.

The satellite, developed by Technische Universität Berlin, was placed in orbit on an SS-N-23 (RSM-54)-type ballistic missile. The Northern Fleet was paid some 200,000 German Mark (US$111,000) for the launch.

In 1999, &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; pioneered the launch of a ballistic missile from the geographic location of the North Pole.

On 17 February 2004, &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; seemingly attempted to test-fire a SS-N-23 ballistic missile, but the missile failed to come out of its silo because of an unspecified technical problem. The Russian Navy, despite earlier statements describing the test, explained that no &quot;physical&quot; launch was intended at all: the exercise was supposed to be a simulation. President of Russia Vladimir Putin was aboard , an &quot;Akula&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine (NATO reporting name Typhoon), to observe the exercise.

On 17 March 2004, &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; physically test-fired two SS-N-23 ballistic missiles, successfully hitting designated practice targets on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Like the other 667BDRM &quot;Delfin&quot; ships in service with the Northern Fleet, &quot;K-407&quot; is slated to receive new SLBMs to replace the RSM-54. The missile is a new-build, minor modernization of the RSM-54. It does not bear a separate designator from the RSM-54/R-29RM/SS-N-23 asides from the name &quot;Sineva&quot;. Testing of the R-29RM &quot;Sineva&quot; was completed in June 2004. &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; is the third &quot;Delfin&quot;-class submarine in line to receive the new missile (after her siblings K-51 &quot;Verkhoturye&quot; and K-84 &quot;Ekaterinburg&quot;). She was fully overhauled and modernized in 2006 before returning to service.

In July 2006, cleric of Aleksandr Nevskiy Cathedral, the head of the Diocesan department on interaction with the Armed Forces and law enforcement agencies, priest Leonid Leontiuk was temporarily included in the personnel list of the K-18 &quot;Kareliya&quot; and was on board of K-407 &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;. During the deployment the priest has performed the consecration ceremony of submarine&#x27;s compartments, met with submarine personnel, led discussions on the basics of faith and spiritual life. Six sailors got baptized on board.

In November 2008 K-407 &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; went to the Zvezdochka plant for general overhaul and modernization. On 29 July 2012 the refit was finished and the submarine returned to active service.

The submarine was expected to remain in service until 2020. However, she was still listed in commission as of 2022.

==2010s==
&quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; was described in Russian sources as being &quot;worthy&quot; of the proud name of &quot;the most shooting&quot; submarine of the Russian Navy. The submarine is part of the 31st Order of the Red Banner underwater strategic missile cruiser division of the 12th submarine squadron of the Northern Fleet (Olenya Bay, Skalisty Naval Base). The submarine&#x27;s commander in 2012 was Captain Stepan Kelbas.

As a member of association of Russian regions and cities, patrons of Northern Fleet ships and units, the Tula Oblast patronages K-114 &quot;Tula&quot; and &quot;K-407&quot; &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; submarines and assists in &quot;patriotic education&quot; and preparation of young people for serving in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Citizens of Novomoskovsk have preference to serve on &quot;K-407&quot; &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;. The submarine crew are regularly provided by humanitarian goods and visited by the city authorities.

==In popular culture==
In 2007, Russian plastic model manufacturer Alanger introduced a 1:350 scale model of &quot;K-407&quot; &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;.
In 2021, Rockstar Games added to GTA Online Kosatka, A Submarine owned by player, and run by Russian sailor called Pavel. The Submarine is highly based on 407 Novomoskovsk

<text>Iraq on the Record: The Bush Administration&#x27;s Public Statements on Iraq was a report by Henry Waxman.

Excerpt from the release of the report by Henry Waxman.

On March 19, 2003, U.S. forces began military operations in Iraq. Addressing the nation about the purpose of the war on the day the bombing began, President Bush stated: “The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder.”

One year later, many doubts have been raised regarding the Administration&#x27;s assertions about the threat posed by Iraq. Prior to the war in Iraq, the President and his advisors repeatedly claimed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction that jeopardized the security of the United States. The failure to discover these weapons after the war has led to questions about whether the President and his advisors were candid in describing Iraq&#x27;s threat.

<doc id="533506" wikidata="Q5616475" url="?curid=533506" title="Guinea Pig Club">
<text>The Guinea Pig Club, established in 1941, was a social club and mutual support network for British and allied aircrew injured during World War II. Its membership was made up of patients of Archibald McIndoe in Ward III at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, Sussex, who had undergone experimental reconstructive plastic surgery, including facial reconstruction, generally after receiving burns injuries in aircraft. The club remained active after the end of the war, and its annual reunion meetings continued until 2007.

==Name==
The name &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; – the rodent species commonly used as a laboratory test subject – was chosen to reflect the experimental nature of the techniques and equipment used for reconstructive work at East Grinstead. The treatment of burns by surgery was in its infancy, and many casualties were suffering from injuries which, only a few years earlier, would have led to certain death. The hospital was nicknamed &quot;the Sty&quot;.

==Origins==

The club was established informally in June 1941 with 39 patients, primarily as a drinking club, and rapidly won McIndoe&#x27;s endorsement. The members were aircrew patients in Ward III and the surgeons and anaesthetists who treated them. Aircrew members had to be serving airmen who had gone through at least two surgical procedures. By the end of the war the club had 649 members. (643 names are listed on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; memorial at Queen Victoria Hospital.)

The original members were Royal Air Force (RAF) aircrew who had severe burns, generally to the face or hands. Most were British but other significant minorities included Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders and by the end of the war Americans, French, Russians, Czechs and Poles. In 1943, a dedicated Canadian wing was built at the hospital, on the initiative of the Royal Canadian Air Force and at Canadian expense. During the Battle of Britain, most of the patients at East Grinstead were fighter pilots, but by the end of the war around 80% of the members were from bomber crews of RAF Bomber Command. A minority of members had suffered non-burns-related injuries (for example, maxillofacial damage incurred in crashes); while another small minority came from army or navy rather than air force backgrounds. A few members even joined the club after the war&#x27;s end, through injuries sustained in peacetime accidents, as Ward III remained operational until 1948.

Before the war the RAF had made preparations by setting up burns units in several hospitals to treat the expected casualties. At East Grinstead, McIndoe and his colleagues, including Albert Ross Tilley, developed and improved many techniques for treating and reconstructing burns victims. They had to deal with very severe injuries: one man, Air Gunner Les Wilkins, lost his face and hands and McIndoe recreated his fingers by making incisions between his knuckles.

Aware that many patients would have to stay in hospital for several years and undergo many reconstructive operations, MacIndoe set out to make their lives relaxed and socially productive. He gave much thought to the reintegration of patients into normal life after treatment, an aspect of care that had previously been neglected. They were encouraged to lead as normal a life as possible, including being permitted to wear their own clothes or service uniforms instead of &quot;convalescent blues&quot;, and to leave the hospital at will. Local families were encouraged to welcome them as guests, and other residents to treat them without distinction: East Grinstead became &quot;the town that didn&#x27;t stare&quot;. The Guinea Pig Club was part of these efforts to make life in hospital easier, and to rebuild patients psychologically in preparation for life outside. There were even barrels of pale ale in the wards – partly in the interests of re-hydrating patients whose injuries had left them dangerously dehydrated, but also to encourage an informal and happy atmosphere.

Later, many of the men also served in other capacities in RAF operations control rooms, and occasionally as pilots between surgeries. Those unable to serve in any capacity received full pay until the last surgical operations and only then were invalided out of the service. McIndoe also later loaned some of his patients money for their re-entry into civilian life.

A club magazine, &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot;, was first published in April 1944.

==Post-war history==
The club was not disbanded at the end of the war, but continued to meet for over sixty years, offering practical support and a sense of community to former patients. &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot; magazine also continued to be published until 2003. Annual meetings at East Grinstead attracted visitors from all over the world. McIndoe had been elected life president at the club&#x27;s foundation: after his death in 1960, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, became president. Geoffrey Page was the first chairman; and Tom Gleave served as the first and only Chief Guinea Pig until his death in 1993.

In 2001 (the 60th anniversary of the club&#x27;s foundation) the members agreed to continue holding their annual reunions at East Grinstead until there were only 50 members left. By 2004, there were 120 survivors; and by 2007 there were 97 (57 in Britain; 40 elsewhere in the world), their ages ranging from 82 to 102. In the event, 2007 marked the last reunion. It attracted over 60 attendees, but in view of the survivors&#x27; age and frailty the decision was then taken to wind the club down. There were believed to be 29 survivors by April 2015, and 17 by November 2016. The last members of the club were Sam Gallop and Jan Stangryciuk-Black, who were both aged 101 when they died only days apart in October 2023.

==Brevet==
The club symbol, or &quot;brevet&quot;, depicted a guinea pig flanked by oversized RAF &quot;wings&quot;. Two artistic renditions were used: the first showed the guinea pig sitting upright with his ears swept back, perhaps in imitation of a pilot at the controls of his aircraft; while the second showed a more naturalistic guinea pig on all fours.

==Anthem==
The words to the club anthem were written by Edward &quot;Blackie&quot; Blacksell. They were inspired by the World War I song &quot;Fred Karno&#x27;s Army&quot;, and (like that song) sung to the tune &quot;Aurelia&quot; by Samuel Sebastian Wesley, best known as the tune of the popular hymn &quot;The Church&#x27;s One Foundation&quot;. The final line of the second verse is an example of a mind rhyme.

==Legacy==

Sixteen members of the club wrote books about their experiences, some of them during the war. The best known, and most influential in raising public awareness of McIndoe&#x27;s work, was Richard Hillary&#x27;s &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;, originally published in the United States as &quot;Falling Through Space&quot; (1942).

One of the pubs in East Grinstead adopted the name &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot;. It closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2009 to make way for a social housing development named Guinea Pig Place.

A painted Roll of Honour is displayed in a corridor of the Canadian Wing at Queen Victoria Hospital.

A bronze monument commemorating McIndoe, sculpted by Martin Jennings (whose own father was a Guinea Pig), was unveiled in East Grinstead High Street in 2014. It depicts a seated airman, with his burned hands clawed together, and his scarred face turned to one side. Behind him, resting a reassuring hand on each shoulder, stands the figure of McIndoe. The two figures are encircled by a stone bench.

In November 2016, a monument honouring members of the club was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh, its president, at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire.

An exhibition in East Grinstead Museum honouring the members of the club was opened in December 2016 by Susan Piper, Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex, with four club members in attendance.

In 2017, the Guinea Pig Club directly inspired the formation of the CASEVAC Club, a similar mutual support group for service personnel badly injured in the Iraq and Afghan wars of the 21st century.

==Popular culture==
Charles MacLean, himself a Guinea Pig, published a novel, &quot;The Heavens are not too High&quot;, in 1957, telling the story of a fighter pilot who suffers severe burns.

&quot;Guinea Pig Club&quot; was the title of a play centred on McIndoe&#x27;s work produced at York Theatre Royal in 2012, featuring Graeme Hawley as McIndoe.

&quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, series 3, episode 2, &quot;Enemy Fire&quot; (2004) features a stately home converted to a burns unit in which the patients are encouraged to drink beer, wear their own clothes and organise entertainment. McIndoe is mentioned in passing.

Joseph Randolph Richard&#x27;s novel &quot;Incendo&quot; (2015) tells the story of a badly burned pilot and his membership of the club.

A film entitled &quot;The Guinea Pig Club&quot;, starring Richard E. Grant as McIndoe, was reported to be planned for production in 2018.

<text>The following is a list of national parks in Turkey.

== History ==
The concept of a national park was introduced for the first time in Turkey by Selahattin İnal, who argued that &quot;nature reserves should have the status of a national park and they should be determined according to natural beauty and touristic potential criteria.&quot; The concept was included in the 25th article of the Forest Law adopted on 31 August 1956, and was included in the legal plane for the first time. The General Directorate of Forestry, which is given the responsibility of the national parks by law, is authorized to declare a national park for the purpose of using it as a scientific and public sports and recreation area, provided that the fauna and flora of the forested areas are preserved. Until 1983, only areas that had forest cover fell within the category of national parks, but the National Parks Law, which was adopted on 8 August 1983, new protection statuses such as nature parks, nature preserve areas, and nature monuments were established and areas with historical, touristic or cultural values could now be declared as national parks even if they were not covered by forests.
 According to the current version of the law, the declaration of a new national park falls within the powers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which takes the advice of the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning on zoning, and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on historical and touristic matters.

In the cases where the area set to become a national park consists of lands belonging to the public as well as fields belonging to the individuals, the area is taken under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which can use measures such as expropriation, transfer, allocation or donation under the Expropriation Law. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has the right to organize, manage, or operate national parks. The right to operate is valid only for national parks not covered by the state forests, and the right to operate the state forests cannot be transferred in accordance with article 169 of the constitution. The management of the national parks is directly done by the Directorate of National Parks, a subbranch of the General Directorate of Nature Conservation and National Parks, which itself is controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Yozgat Pine Grove National Park, one of the remaining ruins of the ancient forests in Central Anatolia, was declared Turkey&#x27;s first national park on 5 February 1958. Antalya has the highest number of national parks among the provinces by having five national parks within its boundaries. With a height of and an area of , Mount Ararat National Park is Turkey&#x27;s largest and highest national park. The last area to be declared a national park was Botan Valley National Park, which was listed on 15 August 2019. Turkey has a total of 44 national parks, which cover an area of .

<doc id="533512" wikidata="Q4961761" url="?curid=533512" title="Janet Leon">
<text>Janet Ava Owji (born 19 October 1990), also known by her stage name OWJI and her former stage name Janet Leon, is a Swedish singer, songwriter and A&amp;R. Leon began her career as part of the pop group Play, for which she was lead singer 2003–2005. She rose to further prominence in Sweden with the release of her hit debut solo album &quot;Janet&quot; (2009) and the successful singles &quot;Let Go&quot; and &quot;Heartache on the Dancefloor&quot;, both also released in 2009.

Leon competed in Melodifestivalen, an annual Swedish song competition which selects the country&#x27;s representative for the Eurovision Song Contest, in 2013 and 2014. Her single &quot;New Colours&quot; was selected as the official song for Stockholm Pride 2013.

==Early life==
Janet Ava Owji was born on 19 October 1990 in Gothenburg, Sweden to an Iranian father and a Spanish mother. She is an only child. Leon grew up in the Gothenburg borough Johanneberg and was in her childhood interested in music, theatre and football. She began playing the violin at the age of four and arranged performances of songs together with her friends while in kindergarten.

Leon began participating in talent shows as a singer at the age of seven; one of her earliest stage appearances was performing Spice Girls songs alongside some of her friends at a school talent show. She also began writing her own songs at around the age of 8. In her youth, Leon and some of her friends were part of a blues band called &quot;Walking Spanish&quot; which performed at various music festivals in Sweden.

Leon&#x27;s musical idols and inspirations include Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Eminem, Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson.

== Career ==

=== 2003–2005: Member of Play ===
Leon&#x27;s professional music career began in 2003 when she at the age of 13 joined the Swedish pop group Play as lead singer in December 2003. She replaced the band&#x27;s former lead singer, then 16-year-old Faye Hamlin, who left to finish her studies at school. Leon became acquintaned to the members of the band through her relatives and was recruited after sending in a demo to the band&#x27;s manager, Laila Bagge. Bagge called back almost immediately after receiving the demo and travelled to Gothenburg the next day to hear Leon perform in person and ask her about her life goals. Leon was officially announced as part of Play in a press release on 15 December 2003.

Leon&#x27;s first album with Play (and the group&#x27;s third studio album overall), &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, was released on 9 March 2004 but turned out to be a commercial failure. In the summer of 2004, Play went on a tour in the United States. The group were accompanied by some of their parents as well as a teacher in order to not fall behind in school. Play performed together with various artists during the tour, including Aaron Carter and Destiny&#x27;s Child; Leon also had a dinner with her idol Beyoncé.

Play&#x27;s next album, the Christmas-themed &quot;Play Around the Christmas&quot;, released in November 2004 and also failed to chart. In 2005 the group then released a compilation of hits, &quot;Girl&#x27;s Mind&quot;, though only songs from Hamlin&#x27;s time as lead singer were featured. In September 2005, Play announced an indefinite hiatus. Play was later briefly reformed 2009–2011, though Leon did not rejoin the group.

=== 2005–2011: Early solo career, debut album ===
After the breakup of Play, Leon began a solo career, working towards the eventual goal of putting together a solo studio album. She continued to work with her manager Laila Bagge, as well as producers Anders Bagge and Andreas Carlsson, who had previously worked with Play. Her early solo work included recording songs for the American toy store brand Build-a-Bear Workshop and for Kohl&#x27;s clothing brand everGirl. In 2005 she also contributed vocals to two songs on the . She voiced a fawn in the 2008 Swedish animated children&#x27;s film &quot;Gnomes and Trolls: The Secret Chamber&quot;.

In late 2008, Leon was chosen to be one of two participants in the Swedish television show &quot;Made in Sweden&quot;, hosted by Laila Bagge, Anders Bagge and Andreas Carlsson. &quot;Made in Sweden&quot; saw the producers attempt to forge successful musical artists; in Leon&#x27;s case the programme followed her over the course of two months as she worked on and prepared her first solo studio album. The album, titled &quot;Janet&quot;, was released in 2009 and became a hit, spending three weeks on the Swedish charts. Leon&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Let Go&quot; (2009), also nearly topped the charts and her second single released later in the same year, &quot;Heartache on the Dancefloor&quot;, rose to number 34 in Sweden and charted for a total of 10 weeks.

Following the release of her album and singles, Leon spent some time touring in Sweden and also began working on a second album. In 2010, she played a part in a Swedish musical stage production based on the film &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), which transplanted the plot of the film to 1960s Sweden. In 2011, Leon recorded vocals for the song &quot;Fire Fly&quot; on the Childish Gambino album &quot;Camp&quot;. On 3 December 2012, Leon released an acoustic version of the new song &quot;These Chains&quot; through the newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot;; &quot;These Chains&quot; was intended to eventually be part of her second album.

=== 2012–2014: Melodifestivalen ===

While working on her potential second album together with songwriter Jörgen Elofsson, the two had the idea to send in a song as a competing entry to Melodifestivalen, an annual Swedish song competition which selects the country&#x27;s representative for the Eurovision Song Contest. Leon and Elofsson saw a potential performance in Melodifestivalen as a good comeback to relaunch Leon&#x27;s musical career.

Leon&#x27;s entry was accepted and she was officially announced as a contestant for Melodifestivalen 2013 in November 2012. Her entry, the original song &quot;Heartstrings&quot;, was written by Fredrik Kempe and Anton Malmberg Hård af Segerstad. Leon performed &quot;Heartstrings&quot; in Skellefteå on 16 February 2013 and placed fifth in her semi-final, failing to qualify for the final. Leon had planned to release her second studio album in 2013 shortly after Melodifestivalen but it as of yet remains unreleased.

On 7 May 2013, Leon&#x27;s new single &quot;New Colours&quot; was selected as the official song for Stockholm Pride 2013. The song was co-written by Leon, along with songwriters Jörgen Elofsson, Lisa Desmond and Jesper Jakobson and debuted at number 10 on the Swedish music chart Svensktoppen. Also in 2013, Leon provided backing vocals for Agnetha Fältskog&#x27;s album &quot;A&quot;.

In November 2013, Leon was announced as a contestant for Melodifestivalen 2014, competing with the song &quot;Hollow&quot;. The song was written by songwriters Karl-Ola Kjellholm, Jimmy Jansson, and Louise Winter and was performed by Leon in Örnsköldsvik on 22 February 2014. Leon placed eighth and last in the semi-final and did thus not qualify for the final. &quot;Hollow&quot; was a challenging song to sing; Leon lost her voice while singing it several times during rehearsals.

=== 2014–present: Career in the United States ===
In late September 2014, Leon moved to Los Angeles, California to further pursue her dreams. Beginning in 2014 she worked as a songwriter and A&amp;R, for instance at the entertainment company DEFIENT. She has in this capacity worked together with various artists, including Elva Hsiao.

On 7 April 2021, Leon partook in the Clubhouse talk &quot;Women in Music – Goddess Power Unite&quot;, hosted by Swedish musician Josefine. The talk also featured various other female musicians and music creatives and also brought attention to the UK-based social organization Girls Out Loud.

In October and November 2022, Leon joined fellow Swedish-Iranian singer Arash on a tour of North America, performing concerts in support of the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran.

On 14 April 2023, she stated that she would no longer be using the stage name &quot;Janet Leon&quot;, citing as reasons the strange experience of growing up in the music industry and not being herself. She instead announced that she would henceforth use the stage name OWJI (pronounced O-G), adapted from her family name.

==Personal life==
Leon moved from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where her musical collaborators were based, in 2009. Leon revealed in February 2012 that she then lived in Stockholm together with her boyfriend, whom she had been dating for sixteen months. In September of the same year Leon moved in together with her friend My in the Årsta borough of Stockholm. Leon has since moved to Los Angeles in 2014 but frequently travels back to Sweden.

<doc id="533513" wikidata="Q1345942" url="?curid=533513" title="University of East London">
<text>University of East London (UEL) is a public university located in the London Borough of Newham, London, England, based at three campuses in Stratford and Docklands, following the opening of University Square Stratford in September 2013. The University of East London began as the West Ham Technical Institute and it was officially opened in October 1898 after approval was given for the construction of the site by the West Ham Technical Instruction Act Committee in 1892 following the Technical Instruction Act of 1889. It gained university status in 1992. It was formerly known as College of East London.

The community is made up of over 40,000 students from over 160 countries studying at the University of East London and collaborative partners.

==History==
UEL can trace its roots back to 1892, when the newly formed County Borough of West Ham decided to establish a West Ham Technical Institute to serve the local community. The institute was to be, in the words of John Passmore Edwards speaking at the building&#x27;s opening ceremony, a &quot;people&#x27;s university&quot;. The college provided courses in science, engineering and art, and also established its own internal degree courses in science and engineering, which were ratified by the University of London. In addition, it had a women&#x27;s department.

As demand for technical education grew throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Essex County Council created two further colleges at Walthamstow and Dagenham (South West Essex Technical College and South East Essex Technical College). In 1970 these three colleges (West Ham, Walthamstow, Dagenham) were combined as a merger of higher education colleges, to create the North East London Polytechnic. Campuses were modernised and revitalised by buildings such as the Arthur Edwards building on the Stratford campus, completed in 1982.

In 1988 the North East London Polytechnic became a higher education institution, and was renamed the Polytechnic of East London in 1989.

In 1992 the Polytechnic of East London became the University of East London, one of a number of &quot;new universities&quot;. UEL&#x27;s succession of founding institutions exemplify the developments that took place in British further and higher education policy throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. The University of East London consisted of the Barking Campus (closed 2006) and the Stratford Campus. In 1999 the Docklands Campus was opened, the first new university campus built in London for over 50 years.

In 2012, following previous opposition, UEL adopted the full increased tuition rates of £9,000 permitted by legislation enacted in 2010, an increase from the previous rate of £3,290. The university is a lead academic sponsor of Hackney University Technical College which opened in 2012, one of the first university technical colleges in England.

In April 2013 the university was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms.

==Campuses==

UEL has three campuses, at Stratford and Docklands, the newest of which, University Square Stratford, opened in September 2013. The Barking campus was closed in 2006.

UEL delivers programmes and short courses at the Barking Learning Centre in a nearby borough. Off campus, there are students registered on programmes with UK and non-UK academic partners, such as the Women&#x27;s Institute of Management in Malaysia.

UCFB is a college of the university.

===Stratford Campus===

The Stratford Campus is close to the 2012 Olympic Park. It is centred around University House, a 19th-century listed building. The campus is home to the School of Education and Communities, the School of Health Sport and Bioscience and the School of Psychology. The Centre for Clinical Education was opened in January 2008. Operating in partnership with the National Health Service, the centre is London&#x27;s only provider of podiatric education.

In 2011 UEL appointed Make Architects to lead the design of a replacement library at the Stratford Campus. The project had a budget of £13 million and the library opened in June 2013.

===Docklands Campus===

The Docklands Campus, opened in 1999, is the largest of the three campuses, It is in the redeveloped Docklands area of east London, at the Royal Albert Dock, closed to commercial shipping since the 1980s and now largely used as a water sports centre and rowing course, for example for the London Regatta Centre.

London City Airport is across the dock from the campus. The Cyprus station of the Docklands Light Railway is adjacent to the campus, and offers links to Canary Wharf and central London.

The campus was shortlisted for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors&#x27; &quot;Building of the Year&quot; in 2001.

New student accommodation opened in 2008 and the campus now has 1,200 student rooms, together with shops, cafés and a restaurant, launderettes and an open-air fitness suite. SportsDock, a £21 million sports and academic centre, opened in March 2012. SportsDock served as the High-Performance Training Centre for Team USA during the London 2012 Olympic Games. The campus library is housed in the Royal Docks Business School building.

===University Square Stratford===
A third campus, University Square Stratford (USS – not to be confused with University Square at the Docklands Campus), opened for the 2013–14 academic year. The building opened being co-owned with Birkbeck, University of London it is situated in Stratford and delivers part-time and full-time study for adults. The project was the first time two higher education institutions created a new shared building. The building provides shared teaching spaces for both higher education institutions and their partners. It is home to the Royal Docks School of Business Law, as well as UEL&#x27;s Institute of Performing Arts. Facilities include performance studios, editing suites, a mooting room and lecture theatres.

In July 2021, the university bought the remaining shares in University Square as part of their Vision 2028 strategy, to &quot;boost careers-led education&quot;, this enabled the UEL&#x27;s Royal Docks School of Business and Law facility within USS to be further enhanced by a trading floor simulator, a mooting room, and a marketing analytics lab.

The building was nominated for the 2014 Carbuncle Cup.

<text>Pal Joey is a 1940 epistolary novel by John O&#x27;Hara, which became the basis of the 1940 stage musical comedy and 1957 motion picture of the same name, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart.
It was originally written as a series of episodic short stories in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the late 1930s.

==Plot==
Taking the form of letters from &quot;pal Joey&quot; to &quot;dear Pal Ted,&quot; a second-rate nightclub singer recounts his life in 1930s Chicago, with a focus on money and women. Although he does not seem aware of it, Joey&#x27;s letters reveal him to be an amoral, calculating heel whose venality is cloaked by an amiable persona. He also does not seem aware of his frequent spelling and grammatical errors (really choices by O&#x27;Hara to convey Joey&#x27;s voice):
Dear Friend Ted

Maybe it is not lack of consideraton . Maybe it is on purpose.

<doc id="533515" wikidata="Q1071567" url="?curid=533515" title="Cat's Eye (1985 film)">
<text>Cat&#x27;s Eye (also known as Stephen King&#x27;s Cat&#x27;s Eye) is a 1985 American anthology horror thriller film directed by Lewis Teague and written by Stephen King. It comprises three stories: &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Ledge&quot;, and &quot;General&quot;. The first two are adaptations of short stories in King&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Night Shift&quot; collection, and the third is unique to the film. The cast includes Drew Barrymore, James Woods, Alan King, Robert Hays and Candy Clark. The three stories are connected by the presence of a traveling cat and Barrymore, both of whom play incidental roles in the first two and major characters in the third.

==Plot==
A stray tabby cat hides from a dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The cat sees the disembodied image of a young girl pleading for help and is picked up by a man.

===&quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;===
Dick Morrison is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc., an Organization formed by a former mob group to quit his smoking habit. The clinic supervisor Vinnie Donatti explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to brutal methods: every time Dick smokes , ruthless consequences will befall his loved ones.

Donatti demonstrates the first of these consequences on the cat which is put in a cage and tormented with electric shocks coming from the floor. He explains that if he smokes, his wife Cindy will be shocked in front of him. For subsequent infractions, his daughter Alicia will be shocked, then Cindy will be raped. Finally, Dick himself will be killed. He hides the threats from his family. Threats that are serious as Dick suspects he is being watched day and night.

During a traffic jam, Dick smokes after finding an old pack of cigarettes and is caught. Before watching Cindy suffer in the electric cage, Dick fights back and fails as the tomcat escapes. Dick tells Cindy everything, and eventually quits smoking for good, but he has gained weight due to quitting. Donatti sets a target weight for him and informs that if it&#x27;s not met that someone will cut off his wife&#x27;s little finger, which is also proved later not to be an idle threat as they had done this before to the wife of his friend.

===&quot;The Ledge&quot;===
The Tomcat travels to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it sees the same disembodied girl&#x27;s image once again asking for his help.

After a road incident the tomcat is taken to the home of Cressner, a crime boss and casino owner who wagers on anything. Cressner has Johnny Norris kidnapped for having an affair with his wife and blackmails him into circumnavigating the exterior ledge of his penthouse. If he succeeds, he will gift him with cash and his wife. If Norris refuses, the police will arrest him for possession of drugs that have been planted in his car.

Cressner taunts Norris through this ordeal by various means, and a pigeon lands beside him and pecks at his foot. Norris eventually returns to the penthouse. Cressner says that he will honor the bet: his butler Albert removes the drugs, and presents him with a bag of cash and his wife&#x27;s head.

Norris attacks him, while the cat trips Albert who drops his gun. Norris seizes the gun and kills Albert, who then threatens Cressner. Norris forces Cressner to circumnavigate the ledge next. The escaping cat watches as Cressner, is attacked by the pigeon, and falls to his death.

===&quot;General&quot;===
The cat then travels to Wilmington, North Carolina, where it is adopted by the girl who was asking for his help earlier, Amanda, who names him General. Her mother, hates cats, and despite Amanda&#x27;s protests, puts General outside at night.

Amanda is in mortal danger from a small, malevolent troll that intruded into the house. That night, the troll emerges via a hole in one of the walls in her room. The troll slays Polly, Amanda&#x27;s pet bird and then tries to supernaturally steal Amanda&#x27;s breath. General finds a way into the house and chases the troll out, but not before it wounds General with its dagger. Amanda and her parents discover the dead bird.

Amanda&#x27;s mother is convinced that General killed Polly, and she takes him to an animal shelter to be euthanized. That night, the troll returns and uses a doorstop to wedge Amanda&#x27;s door shut, before attempting to steal her breath again. General escapes the shelter and rushes back to save Amanda. He fights with the troll and kills it.

After her parents break into the room, they discover parts of the troll&#x27;s corpse, as well as the tiny dagger and the hole in the wall that the troll used. General is rewarded with a large fish, then climbs onto bed with Amanda. She wakes up and cuddles him.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; was released theatrically in the United States by MGM on April 12, 1985. It grossed $13,086,298 at the domestic box office.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Stephen King seems to be working his way through the reference books of human phobias, and &#x27;Cat&#x27;s Eye&#x27; is one of his most effective films.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;the best screen adaptation of any of King&#x27;s work since Brian De Palma&#x27;s &#x27;Carrie&#x27;&quot; and &quot;pop movie making of an extremely clever, stylish and satisfying order.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The three stories just don&#x27;t connect and efforts to join them never work. However, an excellent roster of talent does try its best.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that the opening story &quot;is so funny and so fresh that it&#x27;s a shock and a disappointment to see it come to an end in a half-hour. The movie&#x27;s second short story is as dull as can be; No. 3 is kind of fun; so it all adds up to a better-than-average entertainment that sags terribly in the middle.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;the special effects are impeccable and Giorgio Postiglione&#x27;s production design meticulous and inspired. Yet it&#x27;s the well-drawn characters, plus the brisk, stylish direction of Teague and superb camerawork of Cardiff, that make it work.&quot; Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that all the stories &quot;repeat the same formula,&quot; but the middle one was &quot;the most fun, because of the presence of the peerless Kenneth McMillan,&quot; who &quot;plays here with a good-humored burlesque that recalls Jackie Gleason.&quot; Kim Newman of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; thought the film &quot;would have been sub-standard even as one of the formula Amicus anthologies of the 60s and 70s,&quot; adding, &quot;Despite a few good performances (James Woods, Kenneth McMillan), the film, like &quot;Creepshow&quot; before it, is continually let down by the weak punch lines King provides for his promising anecdotes.&quot;

<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 23 and 30 May 1992. It was the first election held since two military coups in 1987 had severed Fiji&#x27;s 113-year-old constitutional links with the British Monarchy, and later Fijian Monarchy, and ushered in a republic.

The 1992 elections were the first to be held under the new electoral system, which was deliberately biased in favour of ethnic Fijians. National constituencies, elected by universal suffrage and comprising almost half of the House of Representatives under the 1970 constitution, were abolished, and for the first time, all members of the House of Representatives were elected from communal constituencies on closed electoral rolls, for registered members of a particular ethnic group. 37 seats were allocated to ethnic Fijians and only 27 to Indo-Fijians, despite the near-equality of their numbers in the population; one seat was reserved for a representative of the Rotuman Islanders, with five constituencies reserved for General electors (an omnibus category for various minorities including Europeans, Chinese, and Banaban Islanders).

The Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei led by Sitiveni Rabuka, who had instigated the 1987 coups, won 30 of the 38 seats reserved for ethnic Fijians and Rotuman; the remaining eight were won by the extremist Fijian Nationalist Party of Sakeasi Butadroka (three seats), the Soqosoqo ni Taukei ni Vanua (two seats) and independents (three). The 27 Indo-Fijian electorates were almost equally divided between the National Federation Party (which won 14 seats) and the Fiji Labour Party (13). All five of the &quot;general electorates&quot; were won by the General Voters Party.

<doc id="533521" wikidata="Q26567" url="?curid=533521" title="Syriac alphabet">
<text>The Syriac alphabet ( ) is a writing system primarily used to write the Syriac language since the 1st century AD. It is one of the Semitic abjads descending from the Aramaic alphabet through the Palmyrene alphabet, and shares similarities with the Phoenician, Hebrew, Arabic and Sogdian, the precursor and a direct ancestor of the traditional Mongolian scripts.

Syriac is written from right to left in horizontal lines. It is a cursive script where most—but not all—letters connect within a word. There is no letter case distinction between upper and lower case letters, though some letters change their form depending on their position within a word. Spaces separate individual words.

All 22 letters are consonants (called , ). There are optional diacritic marks (called , ) to indicate vowels (called , ) and other features. In addition to the sounds of the language, the letters of the Syriac alphabet can be used to represent numbers in a system similar to Hebrew and Greek numerals.

Apart from Classical Syriac Aramaic, the alphabet has been used to write other dialects and languages. Several Christian Neo-Aramaic languages from Turoyo to the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialect of Suret, once vernaculars, primarily began to be written in the 19th century. The variant specifically has been adapted to write Western Neo-Aramaic, previously written in the square Maalouli script, developed by George Rizkalla (Rezkallah), based on the Hebrew alphabet. Besides Aramaic, when Arabic began to be the dominant spoken language in the Fertile Crescent after the Islamic conquest, texts were often written in Arabic using the Syriac script as knowledge of the Arabic alphabet was not yet widespread; such writings are usually called &quot;Karshuni&quot; or &quot;Garshuni&quot; (). In addition to Semitic languages, Sogdian was also written with Syriac script, as well as Malayalam, which form was called Suriyani Malayalam.

==Alphabet forms==

There are three major variants of the Syriac alphabet: , and .

=== Classical ===

The oldest and classical form of the alphabet is (). The name of the script is thought to derive from the Greek adjective &quot;strongýlē&quot; (, &#x27;rounded&#x27;), though it has also been suggested to derive from (, &#x27;gospel character&#x27;). Although ʾEsṭrangēlā is no longer used as the main script for writing Syriac, it has received some revival since the 10th century. It is often used in scholarly publications (such as the Leiden University version of the Peshitta), in titles, and in inscriptions. In some older manuscripts and inscriptions, it is possible for any letter to join to the left, and older Aramaic letter forms (especially of  and the ) are found. Vowel marks are usually not used with , being the oldest form of the script and arising before the development of specialized diacritics.

=== East Syriac ===
The East Syriac dialect is usually written in the (, &#x27;Eastern&#x27;) form of the alphabet. Other names for the script include (, &#x27;conversational&#x27; or &#x27;vernacular&#x27;, often translated as &#x27;contemporary&#x27;, reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic), (, &#x27;Assyrian&#x27;, not to be confused with the traditional name for the Hebrew alphabet), (, &#x27;Chaldean&#x27;), and, inaccurately, &quot;Nestorian&quot; (a term that was originally used to refer to the Church of the East in the Sasanian Empire). The Eastern script resembles ʾEsṭrangēlā somewhat more closely than the Western script.

====Vowels====
The Eastern script uses a system of dots above and/or below letters, based on an older system, to indicate vowel sounds not found in the script:

* () A dot above and a dot below a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;a&quot; or &quot;ă&quot; (called , ),
* () Two diagonally-placed dots above a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;ā&quot; or &quot;â&quot; or &quot;å&quot; (called , ),
* () Two horizontally-placed dots below a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;e&quot; or &quot;ĕ&quot; (called , or , ; often pronounced and transliterated as &quot;i&quot; in the East Syriac dialect),
* () Two diagonally-placed dots below a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;ē&quot; (called , or , ),
* () The letter &quot;waw&quot; with a dot below it represents , transliterated as &quot;ū&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (called , or , ),
* () The letter with a dot above it represents , transliterated as &quot;ō&quot; or &quot;o&quot; (called , or , ),
* () The letter &quot;yōḏ&quot; with a dot beneath it represents , transliterated as &quot;ī&quot; or &quot;i&quot; (called , ),
* () A combination of (usually) followed by a letter &quot;yōḏ&quot; represents (possibly * in Proto-Syriac), transliterated as &quot;ē&quot; or &quot;ê&quot; (called , ).

It is thought that the Eastern method for representing vowels influenced the development of the &quot;niqqud&quot; markings used for writing Hebrew.

In addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes &quot;ə&quot;, &quot;e̊&quot; or superscript &quot;e&quot; (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic schwa that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac. Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons. Whether because its distribution is mostly predictable (usually inside a syllable-initial two-consonant cluster) or because its pronunciation was lost, both the East and the West variants of the alphabet traditionally have no sign to represent the schwa.

=== West Syriac ===
The West Syriac dialect is usually written in the or (, &#x27;line&#x27;) form of the alphabet, also known as the (, &#x27;simple&#x27;), &#x27;Maronite&#x27; or the &#x27;Jacobite&#x27; script (although the term &quot;Jacobite&quot; is considered derogatory). Most of the letters are clearly derived from ʾEsṭrangēlā, but are simplified, flowing lines. A cursive chancery hand is evidenced in the earliest Syriac manuscripts, but important works were written in ʾEsṭrangēlā. From the 8th century, the simpler Serṭā style came into fashion, perhaps because of its more economical use of parchment.

====Vowels====
The Western script is usually vowel-pointed, with miniature Greek vowel letters above or below the letter which they follow:
* () Capital alpha () represents , transliterated as &quot;a&quot; or &quot;ă&quot; (, ),
* () Lowercase alpha () represents , transliterated as &quot;ā&quot; or &quot;â&quot; or &quot;å&quot; (, ; pronounced as and transliterated as &quot;o&quot; in the West Syriac dialect),
* () Lowercase epsilon () represents both , transliterated as &quot;e&quot; or &quot;ĕ&quot;, and , transliterated as &quot;ē&quot; (, ),
* () Capital eta () represents , transliterated as &quot;ī&quot; (, ),
* () A combined symbol of capital upsilon () and lowercase omicron () represents , transliterated as &quot;ū&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (, ),
* Lowercase omega (), used only in the vocative interjection (, &#x27;O!&#x27;).

==Summary table==

The Syriac alphabet consists of the following letters, shown in their isolated (non-connected) forms. When isolated, the letters , , and are usually shown with their initial form connected to their final form (see below). The letters , , , , , , and (and, in early ʾEsṭrangēlā manuscripts, the letter ) do not connect to a following letter within a word; these are marked with an asterisk (*).

==Contextual forms of letters==
===Ligatures===
==Letter alterations==
===&quot;Matres lectionis&quot;===

Three letters act as &quot;matres lectionis&quot;: rather than being a consonant, they indicate a vowel.  (), the first letter, represents a glottal stop, but it can also indicate a vowel, especially at the beginning or the end of a word. The letter &quot;waw&quot; () is the consonant &quot;w&quot;, but can also represent the vowels &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. Likewise, the letter represents the consonant &quot;y&quot;, but it also stands for the vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot;.
In modern usage, some alterations can be made to represent phonemes not represented in classical phonology. A mark similar in appearance to a tilde (~), called &quot;majlīyānā&quot; (), is placed above or below a letter in the &quot;Maḏnḥāyā&quot; variant of the alphabet to change its phonetic value (see also: &quot;Geresh&quot;):

* Added below : to (voiced palato-alveolar affricate)
* Added below : to (voiceless palato-alveolar affricate)
* Added above or below : to (voiced palato-alveolar sibilant)
* Added above : to 

=== and ===
In addition to foreign sounds, a marking system is used to distinguish (, &#x27;hard&#x27; letters) from (, &#x27;soft&#x27; letters). The letters , , , , , and , all stop consonants (&#x27;hard&#x27;) are able to be &#x27;spirantized&#x27; (lenited) into fricative consonants (&#x27;soft&#x27;). The system involves placing a single dot underneath the letter to give its &#x27;soft&#x27; variant and a dot above the letter to give its &#x27;hard&#x27; variant (though, in modern usage, no mark at all is usually used to indicate the &#x27;hard&#x27; value):

The mnemonic () is often used to remember the six letters that are able to be spirantized (see also: &quot;Begadkepat&quot;).

In the East Syriac variant of the alphabet, spirantization marks are usually omitted when they interfere with vowel marks. The degree to which letters can be spirantized varies from dialect to dialect as some dialects have lost the ability for certain letters to be spirantized. For native words, spirantization depends on the letter&#x27;s position within a word or syllable, location relative to other consonants and vowels, gemination, etymology, and other factors. Foreign words do not always follow the rules for spirantization.
Syriac uses two (usually) horizontal dots above a letter within a word, similar in appearance to diaeresis, called (, literally &#x27;placings&#x27;, also known in some grammars by the Hebrew name [], &#x27;plural&#x27;), to indicate that the word is plural. These dots, having no sound value in themselves, arose before both eastern and western vowel systems as it became necessary to mark plural forms of words, which are indistinguishable from their singular counterparts in regularly-inflected nouns. For instance, the word (, &#x27;king&#x27;) is consonantally identical to its plural (, &#x27;kings&#x27;); the above the word () clarifies its grammatical number and pronunciation. Irregular plurals also receive even though their forms are clearly plural: e.g. (, &#x27;house&#x27;) and its irregular plural (, &#x27;houses&#x27;). Because of redundancy, some modern usage forgoes points when vowel markings are present.

There are no firm rules for which letter receives ; the writer has full discretion to place them over any letter. Typically, if a word has at least one , then are placed over the that is nearest the end of a word (and also replace the single dot above it: ). Other letters that often receive are low-rising letters—such as and —or letters that appear near the middle or end of a word.

Besides plural nouns, are also placed on:
* plural adjectives, including participles (except masculine plural adjectives/participles in the absolute state);
* the cardinal numbers &#x27;two&#x27; and the feminine forms of 11–19, though inconsistently;
* and certain feminine plural verbs: the 3rd person feminine plural perfect and the 2nd and 3rd person feminine plural imperfect.
Syriac uses a line, called (, literally &#x27;concealer&#x27;, also known by the Latin term &quot;linea occultans&quot; in some grammars), to indicate a silent letter that can occur at the beginning or middle of a word. In Eastern Syriac, this line is diagonal and only occurs above the silent letter (e.g. , &#x27;city&#x27;, pronounced , not *, with the over the , assimilating with the ). The line can only occur above a letter , , , , , , , or (which comprise the mnemonic , &#x27;the works of light&#x27;). In Western Syriac, this line is horizontal and can be placed above or below the letter (e.g. , &#x27;city&#x27;, pronounced , not *).

Classically, was not used for silent letters that occurred at the end of a word (e.g. , &#x27;[my] lord&#x27;). In modern Turoyo, however, this is not always the case (e.g. , &#x27;[my] lord&#x27;).

==Latin alphabet and romanization==
In the 1930s, a Latin alphabet for Syriac was developed with some material promulgated. Although it did not supplant the Syriac script, the usage of the Latin script in the Syriac community has still become widespread because most of the Assyrian diaspora is in Europe and the Anglosphere, where the Latin alphabet is predominant.

In Syriac romanization, some letters are altered and would feature diacritics and macrons to indicate long vowels, schwas and diphthongs. The letters with diacritics and macrons are mostly upheld in educational or formal writing.

The Latin letters below are commonly used when it comes to transliteration from the Syriac script to Latin:
* Ā is used to denote a long &quot;a&quot; sound or [ɑː] as heard in &quot;car&quot;.
* Ḏ is used to represent a voiced dental fricative [ð], the &quot;th&quot; sound as heard in &quot;that&quot;.
* Ē is used to denote a long close-mid unrounded vowel, [eː].
* Ĕ is to represent an &quot;eh&quot; sound or [ɛ], as heard in &quot;Ninwĕ&quot;
* Ḥ represents a voiceless pharyngeal fricative ([ħ]), only upheld by Turoyo and Chaldean speakers.
* Ō represents a long &quot;o&quot; sound or [ɔː].
* Š is a voiceless postalveolar fricative ([ʃ]), the English digraph &quot;sh&quot;.
* Ṣ denotes an emphatic &quot;s&quot; or &quot;thick s&quot;, [sˤ].
* Ṭ is an emphatic &quot;t&quot;, [tˤ], as heard in the word &quot;ṭla&quot; (&quot;three&quot;).
* Ū is used to represent an &quot;oo&quot; sound or the close back rounded vowel [uː].

Sometimes additional letters may be used and they tend to be:

* Ḇ may be used in the transliteration of biblical Aramaic to show the voiced bilabial fricative allophone value (&quot;v&quot;) of the letter &quot;Bēṯ&quot;.
* Ī denotes a schwa sound, usually when transliterating biblical Aramaic.
* Ḵ is utilized for the voiceless velar fricative, [x], or the &quot;kh&quot; sound.
* Ṯ is used to denote the &quot;th&quot; sound or the voiceless dental fricative, [θ].

==Unicode==
The Syriac alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.
Additional letters for Suriyani Malayalam were added in June, 2017 with the release of version 10.0.

===Blocks===
The Unicode block for Syriac is U+0700–U+074F:

The Syriac Abbreviation (a type of overline) can be represented with a special control character called the Syriac Abbreviation Mark (U+070F).

<text>The University of Greenwich is a public university located in London and Kent, United Kingdom. Previous names include Woolwich Polytechnic and Thames Polytechnic.

The university&#x27;s main campus is at the Old Royal Naval College, which along with its Avery Hill campus, is located in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Greenwich also has a campus in Medway, Kent, as part of a shared campus. The university&#x27;s range of subjects includes architecture, business, computing, mathematics, education, engineering, humanities, maritime studies, natural sciences, pharmacy and social sciences. 

==History ==
The university dates back to 1890, when Woolwich Polytechnic, the second-oldest polytechnic in the United Kingdom, opened in Woolwich. It was founded by Frank Didden, supported by and following the principles of Quintin Hogg, and opened to students in October 1891. Like Hogg&#x27;s pioneering venture in London&#x27;s Regent Street, it initially combined education with social and religious functions.

In 1894 it focused on an educational role, concentrating on higher technical education appropriate to its location close to Woolwich Dockyard and the Royal Arsenal; William Anderson, director-general of the Ordnance Factories, was a trustee and later a member of the board of governors. Its premises were also used for day schools – the first Woolwich Polytechnic School was established in 1897.

In 1970, Woolwich Polytechnic merged with part of Hammersmith College of Art and Building to form Thames Polytechnic. In the following years, Dartford College (1976), Avery Hill College of Education (1985), Garnett College (1987) and parts of Goldsmiths College and the City of London College (1988) were incorporated.

In 1992, Thames Polytechnic was granted university status by the Major government (together with various other polytechnics) and renamed the University of Greenwich in 1993. On 1 January 1993, the Thames College of Health Care Studies, itself a merger of three local nursing and midwifery training schools, officially merged with the newly designated University of Greenwich, becoming a full faculty of the university.

Formerly a UK government research agency, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) was incorporated into the university in 1996.

In 2001, the university gave up its historic main campus in the Bathway Quarter in Woolwich, relocating to its current main campus in Greenwich.

In 2018, the University of Greenwich started a partnership with Charlton Athletic F.C.

In 2019, the university&#x27;s main cafeteria was operated by BaxterStorey, which paid its workers £9.25 per hour without contractual sick pay. After four strike days in October 2019, Greenwich University announced in early January 2020 that all outsourced cafe workers, cleaners and security guards would receive the London living wage of £10.55, in addition to the same sick pay and annual leave as university staff.

==Organisation==
Academic disciplines at Greenwich are organised into four faculties which host a range of subject expertise within them:

* Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences
* Business School
* Faculty of Education, Health &amp; Human Sciences
* Faculty of Engineering and Science

The university also has a number of professional service directorates that support students and the Faculties.

==Campuses==
===Greenwich===
Greenwich Campus is located mainly in the Old Royal Naval College, into which it moved in the 1990s when the premises were sold by the Royal Navy.

The campus is home to the Business School, the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences and The Faculty of Education, Health and Human Sciences. The campus also includes the Greenwich Maritime Institute, a specialist maritime management, policy and history teaching and research institute, and the Institute for Lifecourse Development. 

The Old Royal Naval College includes &quot;The Painted Hall&quot;, painted in the 18th century by Sir James Thornhill, with over 40,000 square feet of painted surfaces including 200 painting of kings, queens and mythological creatures.

The campus has a large library at Stockwell Street which houses an extensive collection of books and journals, language labs and a 300-PC computing facility. Other facilities include specialist computer laboratories, including one at Dreadnought centre, a TV studio and editing suites. The Stephen Lawrence Gallery, in the Stockwell Street building, showcases the work of contemporary artists and is linked to the School of Design.

The award-winning Dreadnought Building hosts the Students Union and the Faculty of Education, Health and Human Sciences. It has psychology and neuroscience laboratories, an early years simulated classroom, a gym, a bar, a cafe, computer laboratories, and teaching and social spaces for students. The building was formerly the Dreadnought Seaman&#x27;s hospital, named after the HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; quarantine and hospital ship which was moored on the Thames at Greenwich in the mid 19th century. HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; had previously been a ship of the line and fought at the Battle of Trafalgar.

===Avery Hill===
The Avery Hill Campus is situated in Eltham, south of the Avery Hill Park in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, south-east London. The campus is home to student accommodation and to the Faculty of Education, Health &amp; Human Sciences. Courses taught at the site include Teacher Training, Nursing (Adult, Child, Mental Health, Community, Learning Disability), Midwifery, Paramedic Science, Speech and Language Therapy, Physiotherapy, PE and Sport, and Sports Science. 

Facilities include a 220-seat lecture theatre, computer laboratories, a library, sports pitches, strength and conditioning laboratories, as well as a sports hall. 

The site also hosts the Greenwich Learning and Simulation Centre (GLASC) which replicates NHS wards, a critical care unit, a simulated pediatric and birthing centre and operating theatre. GLASC enables student trainees and experienced health professionals to gain hands-on experience and learn new clinical skills by engaging in multi-professional simulation activities. 

The student village complex at Avery Hill provides student self-catering accommodation, a general shop and a launderette. The Dome, in the centre of the complex, houses a food outlet and gym. Rugby, football, indoor pitches, netball and tennis courts, are also on Avery Hill campus.

The facility, which was built by Wimpey Construction under a PFI contract, was completed in 1996.

===Medway===
The Medway Campus is located on a former Royal Navy shorebase (called HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot;) opened in 1903 at Chatham Maritime, Kent.

The Faculty of Engineering and Science is based here, as is the Natural Resources Institute, a centre for research, consultancy and education in natural and human resources. It is also the home of Medway School of Pharmacy, a joint school operated by the Universities of Greenwich and Kent. The Faculty of Education, Health &amp; Human Sciences also offers a number of its courses at Medway, including Midwifery and Paramedic Sciences. Facilities include laboratories, workshops, a computer-aided design studio and a training dispensary.

The Drill Hall Library has computers, study areas and teaching rooms. Social facilities include a sports hall, bar, gym and outdoor tennis courts. The university is a member of Universities at Medway, a partnership of educational establishments at Chatham Maritime that is developing the area as a major higher education centre in the Medway region.

==Research==

Greenwich research seeks to influence and enhance health, education, science, engineering, computing and social policy, and attracts international agencies, government departments and global corporations from over 50 countries. Areas of research and consultancy include landscape architecture, employment relations, fire safety, natural resources, tourism and hospitality, social network analysis, education, training, educational leadership and public services.

Greenwich Campus is near 74-hectare Greenwich Park, home to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The Stockwell Street Building opened in 2014 and is now home to the campus library, film and TV studios, and editing suites. In 2015, it was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize for architecture.

The Dreadnought Building is a central hub for the Greenwich Campus and hosts the Greenwich Students Union and Student Services. Some parts of the other buildings in the Greenwich Campus are Queen Anne Court, King William Court, Queen Mary Court, Stephen Lawrence Building and Stockwell Street Library. 

The Student Village at Avery Hill Campus provides accommodation for around 1,000 students. On-site facilities include a café, canteen, shop, launderette, bicycle parking, and a gym.

===Students&#x27; Union===
Greenwich Students&#x27; Union is the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union. In October 2019, the GSU Student Assembly voted to ask the university to declare a climate emergency and for the university and union sustainability strategies to consult with students in creating them. This call to action aimed to speed up the university&#x27;s efforts at becoming carbon neutral.

At the Medway campus in Kent there is a partnership between the University of Greenwich Students&#x27; Union, Canterbury Christ Church and University of Kent Union on the Medway campus. Greenwich Students&#x27; Union has been leading the partnership since July 2021 and manages The Hub space, previously The Student Hub when it was looked after by GK Unions – the Greenwich &amp; Kent Students&#x27; Unions Together (once the Universities at Medway Students Association, UMSA). Greenwich Students&#x27; Union has a mascot called The Cutty Shark and a presence at Avery Hill, Greenwich and Medway campus.

In 1901, he married Isabel Langrishe. Morris was a counsel for the British government during the North American fisheries arbitration in 1910 receiving a knighthood in 1904. Morris served as governor of the Newfoundland Savings Bank from 1889 to 1913 and was elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1885 as an independent. He joined the Liberal government of Sir William Whiteway as Attorney-General from 1889 to 1895.

Morris was the most senior Roman Catholic politician in Newfoundland and had enormous influence as a result. He had a strained relationship with Whiteway&#x27;s successor as Liberal leader, Sir Robert Bond, splitting with him to form the &quot;Independent Party&quot; which he led from 1898 to 1900. Morris formed an alliance with Bond to defeat the Tories and served as minister of justice from 1900 to 1907 in Bond&#x27;s government. In 1907 he again broke with Bond and formed the People&#x27;s Party. Both parties tied in the 1908 General Election. Robert Bond was asked to form a government. He refused saying he could not because he could not elect a speaker, without losing a vote and thereby bringing down the government. Morris said he could form a government and was made Prime Minister. He lost a confidence vote and then called an election. He led his party to victory in the 1909 election with a clear majority. He served in that position through the First World War and represented Newfoundland at the Imperial War Conference in London.

His People&#x27;s Party government enjoyed strong support from the dominion&#x27;s Catholics but was largely opposed by Protestants. As a result of a wartime crisis over conscription, and the decline of his popularity due to accusations of wartime profiteering and conflict of interest, Morris decided that it was necessary to have a government that had support from all denominations and so he invited the opposition in the House of Assembly to join a National Government which was formed in 1917 to oversee the duration of the war. Morris retired from politics at the end of 1917 after eight years in power.

He was sworn in as a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1911. This gave him the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and after Ennoblement the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for Life.

Morris was made a Knight Commander in the Order of St Michael and St George in 1913.

On 15 January 1918, Morris was elevated to the peerage as the first [[Baron Morris]], &quot;of St John&#x27;s in the Dominion of Newfoundland and of the City of Waterford&quot;, the only Newfoundland-born person to ever be so honoured. Lord Morris moved to London and took his seat in the House of Lords. He lived the rest of his life there, only returning to Newfoundland once. He died in London, in 1935, at the age of 76. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green, London.

<text>A cat&#x27;s eye or road stud is a retroreflective safety device used in road marking and was the first of a range of raised pavement markers. 

==Description==
The cat&#x27;s eye design originated in the UK in 1934 and is today used all over the world. The original form consisted of two pairs of retroreflectors set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a cast iron housing. This is the kind that marks the centre of the road, with one pair of cat&#x27;s eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat&#x27;s eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from snow ploughs.

A key feature of the cat&#x27;s eye is the flexible rubber dome which is occasionally deformed by the passage of traffic. A fixed rubber wiper cleans the surface of the reflectors as they sink below the surface of the road (the base tends to hold water after a shower of rain, making this process even more efficient). The rubber dome is protected from impact damage by metal &quot;kerbs&quot; – which also give tactile and audible feedback for wandering drivers.

==History==

The inventor of cat&#x27;s eyes was Percy Shaw of Boothtown, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. When the tram-lines were removed in the nearby suburb of Ambler Thorn, he realised that he had been using the polished steel rails to navigate at night. The name &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; comes from Shaw&#x27;s inspiration for the device: the eyeshine reflecting from the eyes of a cat. In 1934, he patented his invention (patents Nos. 436,290 and 457,536), and on 15 March 1935, founded Reflecting Roadstuds Limited in Halifax to manufacture the items. The name &quot;Catseye&quot; is their trademark. The retroreflecting lens had been invented six years earlier for use in advertising signs by Richard Hollins Murray, an accountant from Herefordshire and, as Shaw acknowledged, they had contributed to his idea.

The blackouts of World War II (1939–1945) and the shuttered car headlights then in use demonstrated the value of Shaw&#x27;s invention and helped popularise their mass use in the UK. After the war, they received firm backing from a Ministry of Transport committee led by James Callaghan and Sir Arthur Young. Eventually, their use spread all over the world.

In 2006, Cat&#x27;s eyes were voted one of Britain&#x27;s top 10 design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum, a list which included Concorde, Mini, Supermarine Spitfire, K2 telephone box, World Wide Web and the AEC Routemaster bus.

==Local practice==
===United Kingdom and Hong Kong===
In the United Kingdom, different colours of cat&#x27;s eyes are used to denote different situations:

* White is used to indicate the centre line of a single carriageway road or the lane markings of a dual carriageway or motorway.
* Red and amber cat&#x27;s eyes denote lines that should not be crossed. Red is used for the left side of a dual carriageway, while amber is used for the right side of a dual carriageway.
* Green indicates a line that may be crossed, such as a slip road or lay-by.

These units are not very visible in daylight and are generally used in conjunction with traditionally painted lines. Temporary cat&#x27;s eyes with just a reflective strip are often used during motorway repair work. These are typically day glow green/yellow so they are easily visible in daylight as well as in darkness; they can then be used on their own for lane division.

Also seen during motorway repair work are plastic traffic pillars that are inserted into the socket of a retractable cat&#x27;s eye rather than being free-standing. These are often used in conjunction with two rows of the temporary cat&#x27;s eyes to divide traffic moving in opposite directions during motorway roadworks.

Solar-powered cat&#x27;s eyes known as solar road studs and showing a red or amber LED to traffic, have been introduced on roads regarded as particularly dangerous at locations throughout the world. However, shortly after one such installation in Essex in the autumn of 2006 the BBC reported that the devices, which flash at an almost imperceptibly fast rate of 100 times a second, could possibly set off epileptic fits and the Highways Agency had suspended the programme. The suspension appeared to have been lifted by 2015, when LED cat&#x27;s eyes began to be installed along newly re-paved sections of the A1 and A1(M) in County Durham and Tyne and Wear. 

Flashing blue LED cat&#x27;s eyes were demonstrated on the TV show &quot;Accident Black Spot&quot;, aired on Channel 4 on 19 December 2000, which alert the driver to potential ice on the road when a low enough temperature, provisionally set at , is reached. Proposed enhancements in 2013 were to change the standard white light to amber for four seconds after the passing of a vehicle, or red if the following vehicle is too close or traffic ahead is stationary.

===Ireland===

In Ireland yellow cat&#x27;s eyes are used on all hard shoulders, including motorways (neither red nor blue cat&#x27;s eyes are used). In addition, standalone reflector batons are often used on the verge of Irish roads. Green cat&#x27;s eyes are used to alert motorists to upcoming junctions. There are limited installations of actively powered cats eyes, which flash white light, on particularly dangerous sections of road such as the single carriageway sections of the N11.

===United States===
The closest equivalent in the United States is the Stimsonite retroreflective raised pavement marker. Stimsonite markers are made out of plastic, not metal, and were invented in 1963.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, roads are generally marked with white reflective cat&#x27;s eyes every 10-metres along the centreline, occasionally on high volume roads; both Botts&#x27; dots and cat&#x27;s eyes are used (typically there is one cat&#x27;s eye followed by three Botts&#x27; dots places in every ten-metre stretch of highway). The colour pattern on New Zealand roads is white or yellow cat&#x27;s eyes along the centre of the road (yellow indicating overtaking is not permitted), and in certain places red dots along the hard shoulder or left edge of a motorway. Single blue cat&#x27;s eyes are used to indicate the location of fire hydrants. In rural settings and along State Highways, these markings are augmented by retroreflective posts along the edge of the road (white reflectors on the left, yellow reflectors on the right when on a left turning bend). Bridges are similarly marked with retro-reflective markings in diagonal bands of white and black (to the left) and yellow and black (to the right).

===Continental Europe===
In almost all European countries, cat eye road studs will include reflective lenses of some kind. By contrast to the UK where use of cat&#x27;s eyes is widespread, in Continental Europe, cat&#x27;s eyes are rarely used as a permanent fixture. Most appear white or gray during daylight; the colors discussed here are the color of light they reflect. Because of their inconspicuousness during the day, they are always used in conjunction with painted retro-reflective lines; they are never seen on their own.

White markers — for lane markings. When used on dual carriageways, motorways, or one-way roads, they may illuminate red on the reverse, to indicate drivers are traveling the wrong way.
Yellow or amber markers — These are found next to the central reservation (US: median) on motorways and dual carriageways and, in the Republic of Ireland, are also used on hard shoulders.
Red markers — These are found by the hard shoulder on motorways and at the edge of the running surface on other roads. They are also occasionally used to indicate a no-entry road and when traveling down the wrong way of the motorway/dual carriageway.
Green markers — These are used where slip-roads leave and join the main carriageway on dual carriageways. In some countries, they are also used across the entrances of minor roads or accesses onto major single carriageway roads or lay-bys.
Blue markers — Are used to indicate the entrance to police reserved slip-roads (these do not lead anywhere, they are to allow police to park and monitor motorway traffic).
The exception to the above rules are:

Fluorescent yellow markers — These are used to indicate temporary lanes during roadworks on major roads and are glued to the road surface; they are never embedded in it. Any painted markings will be removed from the road surface if they contradict the markers. They are fluorescent yellow in colour, so they stand out in the day, but reflect white light at night. Where used, they are much more numerous and dense than standards markers, as they are not used in conjunction with painted lines. They also appear yellow on the edges but reflect red on the left side or amber on the right

===Lebanon===

In Lebanon, cat&#x27;s eyes are widely used on most freeways, highways and roadways. On freeways and highways, every one (or sometimes two) white stripes separating lanes is followed by a white shining cat&#x27;s eye. On the edge of the road next to the median strip, a yellow cat&#x27;s eye is placed every . On the road shoulders a red shining cat&#x27;s eye is placed every . On roadways separated by double yellow lines, a yellow cat&#x27;s eye is placed inside the double yellow lines every . Before speed bumps, a series of cat&#x27;s eyes are placed shining white to the oncoming traffic and red to the car from the opposite direction. On pedestrian crossings, blue shining cat&#x27;s eyes are placed after every zebra line. On roads with traffic lights, a series of red shining cat&#x27;s eyes are placed before traffic lights to make drivers slow down.

==Safety==
On the morning of 25 April 1999 on the M3 motorway in Hampshire, England, a van dislodged the steel body of a cat&#x27;s eye which flew through the windscreen of a following car and hit electronic musician Kemistry, who was a passenger, in the face, killing her instantly. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Investigators acknowledged that the cat&#x27;s eye bodies occasionally came loose, but added that such an accident was previously unheard of. A question was asked in the House of Lords about the safety of cat&#x27;s eyes in light of the incident, and the Highways Agency conducted an investigation into the &quot;long-term integrity and performance&quot; of various types of road stud.

In the biopic &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023) a damaged metal cat&#x27;s eye is portrayed as causing a fatal accident in the 1957 Mille Miglia road race. At the village of Guidizzolo while travelling along a straight road at 150 mph (240 km/h) a worn left front tyre on the Ferrari 335 S driven by Alfonso de Portago is depicted as being sliced open by a damaged cat&#x27;s eye. The ensuing blowout caused de Portago&#x27;s car to violently flip over and fly out of control, killing him, his navigator and nine onlookers, including children. This cinematic depiction of the cause of the accident is consistent with the Italian judiciary&#x27;s official findings. Enzo Ferrari was prosecuted for 11 counts of manslaughter, but was acquitted in 1961 after a panel of automobile engineers retained as experts by the court opined that the blowout was caused by striking a cat&#x27;s eye.

He had key roles in planning the Vietnam War, serving as deputy to Paul Nitze at Defense under Kennedy and as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs under Johnson.

After leaving government service in 1969, Bundy served as a historian of foreign affairs, teaching at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and at Princeton University, from 1972 to his death. His book &quot;A Tangled Web: The Making of Foreign Policy in the Nixon Presidency&quot; (1998) is considered his most important work.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1917 and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, he came from a family long involved in Republican politics. His father, Harvey Hollister Bundy, served as an assistant secretary of state to Colonel Henry L. Stimson beginning in 1931, and later as his special assistant on atomic matters when Stimson was Secretary of War under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Bundy as a diplomat also helped implement the Marshall Plan. Bill was raised in a highly accomplished, highly intellectual family, with a brother McGeorge Bundy who was two years younger.

After attending Groton School and Yale University (where he was one of the first presidents of the Yale Political Union and a member of Skull and Bones), Bundy entered Harvard Law School. During World War II, he left to join the Army Signal Corps. In August 1943 he led the nine-man 6813th Signals Security Detachment to the UK secret code breaking &#x27;Government Code and Cipher School&#x27; at Bletchley Park. He and six other cryptanalysts worked in Hut 6 and the two translators worked in Hut 3. They fitted in well and he later described his time there as &quot;the most satisfying of my career.&quot;

==Career==
After finishing law school in 1947, Bundy joined the Washington-based law firm of Covington and Burling. While there, he contributed to Alger Hiss&#x27;s defense fund in the Hiss-Chambers Case. In 1953, Senator Joseph McCarthy cited his $400 contribution. Bundy explained that Donald Hiss, Alger&#x27;s brother, worked with him at Covington &amp; Burling. Allen Dulles and Vice President Richard M. Nixon defended him, and the matter was dropped. (Bundy&#x27;s father, Harvey Hollister Bundy, Sr., served as chairman of the board at Carnegie from 1953 to 1958, not long after Hiss served as president from 1946 to 1949.)

In the early 1950s, Bundy was recruited for the Central Intelligence Agency, serving as an analyst and as chief of staff for the Office of National Estimates. In 1960, Bundy took a leave of absence from the CIA to serve as staff director for Eisenhower&#x27;s Commission on National Goals. During the Kennedy years, he was deputy to Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Paul Nitze (becoming Assistant Secretary in November 1963). He also worked for the Secretary of the Navy. During much of the LBJ era, he was Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs.

He continued to serve as an advisor on Vietnam following the election of President Richard M. Nixon, but resigned from government in 1969. Bundy moved to academia, teaching at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1972 he moved to Princeton University, where he served as a professor for the rest of his life. He edited the influential journal, &quot;Foreign Affairs,&quot; of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1972 to 1984, also serving as a member of the Council. He declined an offer by the Council&#x27;s chairman, David Rockefeller, to be the Council&#x27;s president.

His brother, McGeorge Bundy (1919–1996), also attended Yale and was a member of Skull and Bones. After being involved in intelligence and the Council on Foreign Relations, he served from 1961 to 1966 as the National Security Advisor to both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

Bill Bundy was somewhat to the left of his brother politically, and was a spirited opponent of Joseph McCarthy. He was also considered one of the administration&#x27;s more dovish members on Vietnam, and was an advisor to three presidents. In 1989 he acknowledged the complexity of the presidents&#x27; decisionmaking, saying, &quot;In a nutshell, my present feeling is that it was a tragedy waiting to happen, but one made much worse by countless errors along the way, in many of which I had a part.&quot;

Bundy was Honorary American Secretary General of the Bilderberg Meetings from 1975 to 1980. 

Bundy&#x27;s most noted work is &quot;A Tangled Web: The Making of Foreign Policy in the Nixon Presidency&quot; (1998). His papers are held by the Seeley G. Mudd Library at Princeton University.

==Personal life and death==
Bill Bundy married Mary Acheson, the daughter of Truman&#x27;s Secretary of State Dean Acheson and his wife Alice. Bill and Mary had three children, Michael, Christopher, and Carol.

On October 6, 2000, William Putnam Bundy died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 83 from heart trouble.

<text>The Rover K-series engine is a series of internal combustion engines built by Powertrain Ltd, a sister company of MG Rover. The engine was a straight-four cylinder built in two forms, SOHC and DOHC, ranging from .

==Design history==

The K series was introduced in 1988 by Rover Group as a powerplant for the Rover 200 car. It was the second volume-production implementation of the low-pressure sand-casting (or LPS) technique in a new plant sited between East Works and Cofton Hackett. (The first volume application of the LPS process had been for the M-16 cylinder head, produced in South Works, adjacent to the former forge). The LPS process pumped liquid aluminium into a chemically-bonded sand mould from below. This reduced oxide inclusions and gave a casting yield of around 90%, compared with 60% for more conventional gravity casting processes. The process avoided many of the inherent problems of casting aluminium components and consequently permitted lower casting wall thickness and higher strength-to-weight ratios. However, the process required the use of heat-treated LM25 material which gave the engines a reputation for being fragile. An engine overheat would often result in the material becoming annealed and rendering the components scrap. The layout of the engine bay on some Rover cars fitted with K-series engines – particularly the MGF with its mid-engined layout – means that a commonly-occurring coolant leak under the inlet manifold can go undetected until severe damage has been done to the head. The aluminium engine blocks were fitted with spun-cast iron cylinder liners that were initially manufactured by GKN&#x27;s Sheepbridge Stokes of Chesterfield, but these were replaced by liners made by Goetze. Unfortunately a large number of aftermarket engines, the so-called &quot;VHPDs&quot;, were built with the old substandard GKN liners by Minister, Lotus and PTP well after the introduction of the Goetze liners to production in 2000.

The engine was introduced initially in 1.1-litre single overhead cam and 1.4-litre dual overhead cam versions. Because Honda stopped providing Rover with engines after the end of their relationship, but well before the BMW takeover, an enlargement of the K Series design to 1.6 and 1.8 litres was carried out. This was done by using larger diameter cylinder liners and also increasing the stroke. The change required a block redesign with the removal of the cylinder block&#x27;s top deck and a change from &quot;wet&quot; liners to &quot;damp&quot; liners. The plastic throttle body fitted to the engine until 2001 was manufactured by the SU Carburettor company. They also included aluminium and larger sized bodies.

The four-cylinder engines were held together as a sandwich of components by long through-bolts which held the engine under compression, though this construction is not unknown, and was used in early lightweight fighter engines from the First World War. It had also been used in motorcycle engines and Triumph&#x27;s &quot;Sabrina&quot; Le Mans race engine.

The two types of head that were bolted to the common four-cylinder block were designated K8 (8 valves) and K16 (16 valves). A later head design also incorporated a Rover-designed Variable Valve Control (VVC) unit (derived from an expired AP patent). This allowed more power to be developed without compromising low-speed torque and flexibility. The VVC system constantly alters the inlet cam period, resulting in a remarkably flexible drive: the torque curve of a VVC K-series engine is virtually flat throughout the rev range and power climbs steadily with no fall-off whatsoever until the rev limiter kicks in at 7,200 rpm.

Following the collapse of MG Rover Group in 2005, the K Series engine started a new and rather interesting chapter in its history.
Two separate re-developments of the engine were taking place by at the time two rival Chinese car firms.

The Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile (NAC) purchased the assets of MG Rover and in doing so acquired use of the Longbridge plant and the intellectual property rights and production tooling to many designs, including those of the K series engine.

With the help of Lotus Engineering, NAC went on to produce the N Series an improved version of the K Series with redesigned headgasket and oil rail built on the original tooling.

This engine featured in the relaunched MG TF in the UK and the MG3 SW and MG7 in China. Contrary to popular belief, the N Series was never fitted to the MG 6.

When the MG TF ceased production for the final time in 2011, so did the N Series.

The second development was by the larger Chinese conglomerate SAIC Motor. SAIC had also previously purchased the rights and blueprints to several of MG Rovers designs. Whilst they had the necessary know-how they didn&#x27;t have any tooling so had to essentially reverse engineer their version of the engine.

The advantage of this was it allowed Ricardo 2010, the company tasked by SAIC to carry out development the opportunity to improve the engine in a number of areas.

The main areas of improvement included the head being redesigned to improve the waterways and structural rigidity and the block was also strengthened.

All new tooling was used in its production and the quality of materials and that of the aluminium casting process created a much more substantial update than that of the N Series.

This new engine would go on to power the Roewe 750, the Roewe 550 and later after the two firms NAC and SAIC merged, The MG 6.

==Engine management==

===K8 engine===
Early K8 engines used a single SU KIF carburetor with a manual choke and a breaker-less distributor mounted on the end of the camshaft. MEMS Single-point injection became standard with the launch of the Rover 100 in 1994.

===K16===
K16 models used MEMS, with a 1.6 ECU from 1990 until 1994 and a 1.9 ECU from 1995 onwards, in either Single Point or Multi Point forms, with a single coil on the back of the engine block and a distributor cap and rotor arm on the end of the inlet camshaft. MEMS 2J was used on the VVC engine, to control the Variable Valve Control and the Distributorless Ignition System, which was used because there were camshaft drive belts at both ends of the engine. With the launch of the Rover 25 and Rover 45 in 1999, MEMS 3 was introduced, with twin coils and sequential injection.

==Model range==
===1100===

All 1100 engines displace with bore X stroke of 75 mm × 63 mm. Four variations were created:
*SOHC K8 8-valve, Carburettor, 
*SOHC K8 8-valve, SPI, 
*SOHC K8 8-valve, MPI, 
*DOHC K16 16-valve, MPI, 

Cars that came with the 1100:
*Rover Metro
*Rover 100
*Rover 200
*Rover 25

===1400===

Engine Codes: 14K2F (8V), 14K4F (16V), 14K16 (16V)?

All 1400 engines displace with bore X stroke of 75 mm × 79 mm (2.95 in × 3.11 in) and have DOHC, 16 valves and MPI. Six variations were created:
*SOHC K8 8-valve, Carburettor, 
*SOHC K8 8-valve, SPI, 
*SOHC K8 8-valve, MPI, 
*DOHC K16 16-valve, SPI, 
*DOHC K16 16-valve, MPI, 
*DOHC K16 16-valve, MPI, 

The K16 variant is exactly the same as the version, apart from a restrictive throttle body designed to lower the car&#x27;s insurance group. This can be converted to the model by changing to the unrestricted throttle body of a 103 engine. The Spi features single-point fuel injection rather than the multi-point of the later engine.

Cars that came with the 1400:

*Rover Metro
*Rover 100
*Caterham 7
*Rover 200
*Rover 25
*Rover 400

Turbocharged:&lt;br&gt;

The 1.8 Turbo was developed to replace the 2.0 Rover KV6 engine due to emissions and fuel economy, the engine is turbocharged and made 
* 2000-2005 Rover 75 
* 2001-2005 MG ZT

VVC (18K4K):&lt;br&gt;

The VVC engine came in three variant:&lt;br&gt;

* The early VVC produced @ 7000 rpm / @4500 rpm 


* Rover later tuned the VVC to produce @ 7000 rpm / @4700 rpm 


* VHPD – Very-high-performance derivative, (Lotus version) (Uses VVC unique cylinder head casting (similar to VVC casting), has big valves, but with fixed cam timing – No development input was requested from Rover).


==Kavachi engine==

The SAIC Kavachi engine is an extensively improved version of the Rover K series, using a different turbo and gearbox, improved head gasket and strengthened block. UK engineering firm Ricardo plc, expert in race engine designs, was commissioned to not only redesign the engine but also the manufacturing process to produce what is now a very reliable engine. It is only available in version.

<text>John Dwight Chesbro (June 5, 1874 – November 6, 1931) was an American professional baseball pitcher. Nicknamed &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, Chesbro played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1899–1902), the New York Highlanders (1903–1909), and the Boston Red Sox (1909) of Major League Baseball (MLB). Chesbro finished his career with a 198–132 win–loss record, a 2.68 earned run average, and 1,265 strikeouts. His 41 wins during the 1904 season remains an American League record. Though some pitchers have won more games in some seasons prior to 1901, historians demarcating 1901 as the beginning of &#x27;modern-era&#x27; major league baseball refer to and credit Jack Chesbro and his 1904 win-total as the modern era major league record and its holder. Some view Chesbro&#x27;s 41 wins in a season as an unbreakable record.

Chesbro&#x27;s 1904 pitching totals of 51 games started and 48 complete games also fall into the same historical category as his 1904 wins total, as they are all-time American League single-season records. These 1904 single-season totals for games started and complete games, like the wins total, are also the most recorded by a pitcher in either the American or National League since the beginning of the 20th century and the co-existence of the American and National Leagues as major leagues. If one demarcates 1901 as the beginning of major league baseball&#x27;s modern era, Jack Chesbro holds the modern era major league historical single-season records for wins by a pitcher (41), games started by a pitcher (51), and complete games pitched (48).

Chesbro was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee, though he had received little consideration from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake, and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the basis of his 1904 season.

==Early life==
John Dwight Chesbro was born on June 5, 1874, in Houghtonville, a village in North Adams, Massachusetts. He was the fourth of five children of Chad Brown Chesebrough, a shoemaker, and Martha Jane Fralensburgh.

In 1892, Chesbro began playing for a sandlot ball team in Houghtonville. He worked in 1894 as an attendant at the Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital in Middletown, New York in order to play for the Asylums, the team representing the mental hospital. There, an inmate gave Chesbro the nickname &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, due to his pleasant demeanor.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Chesbro began his professional career in minor league baseball in 1895. That year, he pitched for the Albany Senators of the New York State League until they folded, at which point he joined the Johnstown Buckskins. When the league disbanded during the season, he joined the Springfield Maroons of the Eastern League. In 1896, Chesbro pitched for the Roanoke Magicians of the Virginia League, until it disbanded. He pitched the remainder of the 1896 season in Cooperstown, New York for the Cooperstown Athletics. There, the local newspaper shortened his last name to &quot;Chesbro&quot; so that it would fit in the box score.

Chesbro pitched for the Richmond, Virginia based Richmond Bluebirds of the Atlantic League from 1897 through 1899. After the 1898 season, he was drafted by Ned Hanlon of the Baltimore Orioles. However, Hanlon took a job with the Brooklyn Superbas and the Orioles were nearly contracted, resulting in Chesbro not signing with Baltimore, as Hanlon allowed the option to lapse. He returned to Richmond for the 1899 season.

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1899–1902)===
Chesbro was sold by Richmond to the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 7, 1899, for $1,500 ($ in current dollar terms). He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Pirates on July 12, 1899. He recorded a 6–9 win–loss record for the 1899 Pirates. After the season, on December 8, 1899, Chesbro was traded with George Fox, Art Madison, John O&#x27;Brien, and $25,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to the Louisville Colonels for Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke, Bert Cunningham, Mike Kelley, Tacks Latimer, Tommy Leach, Tom Messitt, Deacon Phillippe, Claude Ritchey, Rube Waddell, Jack Wadsworth, and Chief Zimmer. The Louisville club dissolved that offseason, and Chesbro, Fox, Madison and O&#x27;Brien were assigned to Pittsburgh in March as the National League (NL) reduced from 12 to eight teams.
After going 15–13 for the 1900 Pirates, Chesbro won 21 games for the 1901 Pirates, while leading the NL with six shutouts. He went 28–6 with a 2.17 earned run average (ERA) for the 1902 Pirates, leading the NL in wins and shutouts. The Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901 and 1902.

===New York Highlanders (1903–1909)===
At the end of the 1902 season, the upstart American League (AL) began to entice NL stars to join their league by offering competitive salaries. Chesbro agreed to sign with a new AL franchise, the New York Highlanders (presently known as the New York Yankees), for the 1903 season, for a $1,000 bonus ($ in current dollar terms) to join the AL. The news broke when Jesse Tannehill, who also agreed to join the Highlanders, told Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss about the planned defection while under the influence of pain medication. When he refused to participate in a postseason series, Dreyfuss released Chesbro from the Pirates.
Chesbro pitched the Highlanders&#x27; first game. He finished the 1903 season with a 21–15 record. Chesbro began throwing a spitball in the 1904 season, which he learned from Elmer Stricklett, the inventor of the spitball. Chesbro also began working on a &quot;slow ball&quot;. That year, he started 51 games and finished 48 while posting a 1.82 ERA, striking out 239 batters, and recording 41 wins and 48 complete games over innings pitched, setting MLB records for wins, complete games, and innings pitched in a season. That year, no other pitcher in the league won more than 26. Chesbro won 14 straight games from May 14 through July 4, a New York franchise record that stood until Roger Clemens broke it in 2001. His 239 strikeouts remained a team record until Ron Guidry struck out 248 in 1978. On the last day of the season, in a game against the Boston Americans (now known as the Boston Red Sox), he threw a wild pitch in the top of the ninth inning, allowing the winning run to score from third base and causing the Highlanders to lose the pennant to Boston. The ruling on this play was controversial. Even after Chesbro&#x27;s death in 1931, his widow, with the support of former Highlanders manager Clark Griffith, continued to claim that the pitch was a passed ball, and blamed the winning run on catcher Red Kleinow.

Before the 1905 season, Chesbro announced that he had created a pitch he called the &quot;jump ball&quot;. He struggled in the 1905 season, registering a 19–15 record. During the 1905 season, Chesbro was involved in the first squeeze play in major league baseball. At third base, Chesbro mistakenly thought he had received a steal sign from manager Clark Griffith, while Willie Keeler bunted for a hit. As Chesbro scored, Griffith made a note of the play and taught it in spring training the following season.

Many baseball observers expected Chesbro to return to form in 1906. That season, Chesbro registered a 23–17 record while leading the AL in earned runs allowed. He was removed from his starts 16 times, the most in the AL.

Chesbro announced he would work on keeping his weight down prior to the 1907 season, but announced his intentions to retire in February 1907. In March 1907, he announced he would return, but not at a pay cut. He signed a new contract two weeks into the 1907 season, in which he went 10–10.

After the 1907 season, Chesbro announced that he was giving up the experimental spitball, intending to return to the &quot;old style of pitching&quot; in 1908. He finished the 1908 season with a 14–20 record.

Prior to the 1909 season, Chesbro was assigned to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, a minor league affiliate of the Highlanders. However, Chesbro threatened to retire if transferred there, and did not report to the Highlanders at first. Chesbro made nine appearances for the Highlanders in 1909, before he was waived and claimed by the Boston Red Sox in September 1909.

===Boston Red Sox (1909)===
Chesbro pitched one game for the Red Sox, the season finale against the Yankees. The Red Sox returned Chesbro to the Highlanders prior to the 1910 season, but he was placed on the ineligible list after he refused to report to the minor leagues.

==Post-playing career==
Chesbro returned to Massachusetts during the 1910 season, where he worked on a farm in Conway, Massachusetts, that he purchased a decade prior. He pitched for a semi-professional baseball team in Whitinsville, Massachusetts, leading them to a championship. Chesbro coached for Massachusetts Agricultural College (presently known as the University of Massachusetts Amherst) in 1911 and continued to pitch for semipro clubs in Massachusetts.

Chesbro met with Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about attempting a comeback. Wolverton agreed to give Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro&#x27;s request for reinstatement as a free agent was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback. He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.

Chesbro appeared in an old-timers game at Braves Field, sponsored by &quot;The Boston Post&quot; to benefit Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, on September 11, 1922. He served as a Washington Senators coach in 1924, which were managed by his former Highlanders manager, Clark Griffith. However, he and Ben Egan were let go when the Senators hired Al Schacht on June 1. In 1927, he managed a minor league team in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, pitching for the team on occasion.

==Legacy==

Chesbro was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee, which considers individuals who are eligible for the Hall of Fame, but no longer eligible to be elected by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). That year, the Veterans Committee elected eleven players: Chesbro, Jesse Burkett, Frank Chance, Johnny Evers, Clark Griffith, Tommy McCarthy, Joe McGinnity, Eddie Plank, Joe Tinker, Rube Waddell, and Ed Walsh. During years where Chesbro was eligible on the BBWAA ballot, Chesbro received zero votes in the 1936 balloting, one vote in the 1937 balloting, two votes in the 1938 balloting, and six votes in the 1939 balloting, zero votes in the 1942 balloting, and zero votes in the 1945 balloting.

Chesbro&#x27;s 1904 record for games won in a season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, or in any other sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 complete games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). The last pitcher to win as many as 30 games was Denny McLain in 1968. The pitcher&#x27;s mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, and since then no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.

Tinker considered Chesbro one of the six toughest pitchers he faced in MLB. Dan Holmes, who runs the Hall of Fame&#x27;s website, called Chesbro &quot;one of the best pitchers in the game at that time.&quot;

However, Chesbro&#x27;s induction is considered dubious, as his overall career was overshadowed by his 1904 season. Baseball historian Bill James considers Chesbro to be undeserving of induction to the Hall of Fame. In particular, James compared Chesbro&#x27;s statistics to those of former Pittsburgh Pirate teammates Deacon Phillippe (189–109, 2.59), Sam Leever (194–100, 2.47), and Jesse Tannehill (197–117, 2.80), none of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In his book &quot;The Politics of Glory&quot;, James charged that the induction of undeserving players created a &quot;second tier&quot; in the Hall of Fame. James claimed that Chesbro was inducted into the Hall of Fame solely on the basis of his 1904 season, even though other pitchers who did not make the Hall of Fame have similar career statistics.

==Personal life==
Chesbro married Mabel Suttleworth of Conway, Massachusetts, in 1896. After his retirement, Chesbro farmed and raised poultry in Conway, where he died on November 6, 1931, of a myocardial infarction; he was buried at Howland Cemetery in Conway. Mabel died in 1940.

<text>RTV B92, or simply B92 (stylized as b92, formerly BΞ92 and B 92), is a Serbian news station and broadcaster with national coverage headquartered in Belgrade.

Founded in 1989 as radio station, it was a rare outlet for Western news and information in FR Yugoslavia under Slobodan Milošević, and was a force behind many demonstrations that took place in Belgrade during the turbulent 1990s. It also played rock music. Due to this, RTV B92 won the MTV Free Your Mind award in 1998, and many other awards for journalism and fighting for human rights. RTV B92 is the subject of the best-selling book &quot;This is Serbia Calling&quot;. On 6 October 2000, the day following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, television B92 started broadcasting.

During the 2000s, the company has undertaken a shift from political and societal topics towards commercialization, and has changed the ownership structure multiple times. The B92 brand name was subject to several replacements and restorations: in July 2015, Radio B92 was shut down and was replaced by a new station called &quot;Play Radio&quot;. In April 2008, the second TV (cable-only) channel named &quot;B92 Info&quot;, with 24-hour news coverage was launched, to be replaced by &quot;Prva World&quot; in 2016, under the sister brand Prva TV. In 2017, TV B92 changed its name to &quot;O2.TV&quot;, only to be restored to B92 in March 2020.

RTV B92 media company continues to operate the Play Radio and B92 television channel. other active segments of the B92 media network are &quot;B92.net&quot; web portal, &quot;B92 Fond&quot; humanitarian fund, &quot;Samizdat B92&quot; book publisher and &quot;Rex&quot; cultural center. The most prominent person in RTV B92 history is Veran Matić, who was one of the founders and CEO from B92&#x27;s establishment in 1989 until 2019.

==History==
===Radio===
====1989–2015: B92 Radio====
Radio B92 was founded in May 1989 in Belgrade as a predominantly youth-oriented station on 92.5 MHz FM. It received financial help from the Open Society Foundations and the USAID. It was briefly closed down by authorities in March 1991.

During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, RTV B92 was one of the very few sources for news not controlled by the government. Although the government did everything in its power to prevent RTV B92 from transmitting its programs they failed. With the help of Dutch internet provider XS4All, RTV B92 started broadcasting their programs over the internet in 1996. These broadcasts were then also re-transmitted via the BBC World Service while several local stations on the ground made the programs available throughout Serbia. In 1996 the Internationale Medienhilfe organisation awarded the title &quot;Radiostation des Jahres&quot; to Radio B92.

It was forced off the air for a time in 1999 when NATO bombed Yugoslavia, and government agents cracked down on pro-Western reporting. The government took over the station in 1999 but the team continued broadcasting in borrowed studios as B2-92. In a dawn raid in May 2000 government troops seized everything. Internet broadcasting from secret studios continued however, until after the ousting of Milošević in October 2000, when the two stations were unified. It has continued as a combined music and news radio station since.

Throughout the years it has become a national radio with wide audience. The radio station at its peak had around 400,000 daily listeners which made up 35% of all radio listeners with almost 80 stations competing for airtime. As of 2014, Radio B92 covered the whole of the territory of Serbia.

The most notable radio shows were &quot;Kažiprst&quot; (&quot;index finger&quot;), featuring usually live or occasionally live-to-tape interviews with notable public figures, &quot;Peščanik&quot; (&quot;Hourglass&quot;), liberal talk show, radio blog of a sort, edited by Svetlana Vuković and Svetlana Lukić and the morning program &quot;Dizanje&quot; (&quot;getting up&quot;).

In the afternoon of 9 July 2015, most of the radio employees were fired. Among the people who lost their job on that occasion were all employees in the news and music section—sections that made Radio B92&#x27;s trademark. On that same day all radio shows were cancelled, leaving only the radio broadcasting music and two remaining employees responsible for that.

====2015–present: Play Radio====
On 13 July 2015, the new &quot;Play Radio&quot; began on 92.5 MHz FM, broadcasting only music and the promo of the station, this time mentioning the B92 name. Following the name change, the B92&#x27;s site&#x27;s radio section now redirects to the &quot;Play Radio&quot; website, which includes a stream, which lets visitors listen to the station. However, &quot;Play Radio&quot; began as a summer schedule announcement on the now-closed Radio B92. The station began broadcasting on 31 August 2015 at 06:00.

===Television===

====2000–2003====
On 6 October 2000, TV B92 began broadcasting as a local TV station reaching Belgrade&#x27;s greater municipal area and parts of Vojvodina. Over the next few years, the station expanded its network of repeaters and could be seen in most of Serbia.

From the 2000s, the daily newscast on TV B92 become popular with viewers. Its TV news service was the second most watched in Serbia after the national broadcaster. The afternoon edition was at 4 PM and the central edition was at 8 PM. This was an only edition with two presenters (both male and female). The evening news had cast at 12 AM and was particularly popular and had a large surge in the ratings. The news provided by TV B92 were very comprehensive which has contributed to the ratings going up. 

====2003–2011====

On 11 October 2004, TV B92&#x27;s news program Vesti B92 introduced the ticker, which was replaced by flipper on 19 March 2012. The ticker was returned on 4 February 2013, which was replaced by flipper again on 3 February 2014.

In April 2006, TV B92 was officially given a national commercial broadcasting license along with TV Pink, Fox Televizija, TV Avala and TV Košava. The station&#x27;s most notable regular TV programmes included &quot;Utisak nedelje&quot; (&quot;Impression of the week&quot;) by Olja Bećković, &quot;Poligraf&quot; (Polygraph) by Jugoslav Ćosić and Antonela Riha, and &quot;Timofejev&quot; by Aleksandar Timofejev. The &quot;Insajder&quot; (Insider) series by Brankica Stanković were running intermittently and was one of the rare cases of investigative journalism on Serbian television.

Until 2006, TV B92 has undertaken a noticeable shift towards commercialization. Since 2006, it was broadcasting the Serbian version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality series (&quot;Veliki brat&quot;), for which it received both a huge boost of ratings, as well as much criticism from its traditional viewers. The trend has continued with shows like &quot;Uzmi ili ostavi&quot; and &quot;Želite li da postanete milioner?&quot; quizzes (local versions of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, respectively).

TV B92 also held the Serbian market TV rights for the UEFA Champions League from 2003 to 2006.

In rating seasons starting September 2007 lasting until July 2008, TV B92 has introduced a much more commercialised line-up. It has heavily advertised its shows during the non-ratings season of summer 2007.

The network has bought out rights to broadcast a new local show called &quot;Naša mala klinika&quot; based around a small medicinal practice on the outskirts of town. The show features many famous Serbian actors and actresses. Another local show called &quot;Vratiće se rode&quot; will be shown on TV B92. The network has also filmed a new season of popular comedy show &quot;Mile vs. Tranzicija&quot;.

The 2008–09 season started in October. The most important project for the season for the station was Operacija Trijumf. Operacija Trijumf (Star Academy) was the biggest musical reality show in the Balkans and it was shown on television in Montenegro (IN TV), Croatia (Nova TV), Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia. In 2009, the station also bought TV rights for Wimbledon (for the next 4 years, until 2013). Champions league matches were also being aired by TV B92.

On 7 April 2008, B92 Info was a news broadcasting channel launched by TV B92, as a Serbian version of CNN. The channel was broadcasting on all major cable systems in the country and over the Internet. All of TV B92&#x27;s most popular news-related shows, including Poligraf, B92 Investigates, Insajder, Kažiprst, Dizanje, and sports programs, were broadcast on the channel. TV B92 had called Info channel launch as the biggest project of the company&#x27;s television segment. B92 Info has since 2010 also been available in Austria.

====2011–2012====
In the spring of 2011, the purple crystal-kryptonite which can be rotated, suddenly appeared in Belgrade. Because of that, TV B92 became surprised and made a speculation talking about the crystal-kryptonite at Knez Mihailova Street in Belgrade. From 19 April 2011 to 20 April 2011, TV B92 started to air some promos with this crystal-kryptonite and were advertising something, but during its news program Vesti B92 on 20 April 2011 at 11 pm, it was known that TV B92 is going to be rebranded on 21 April 2011. Then on 21 April 2011, TV B92 started the new season of 2011–12 and underwent a visual makeover. At the same time, it introduced a new logo that consists of a purple crystal-kryptonite that contains an orange slash while the &quot;B 92&quot; wordmark are appearing in the middle of the crystal-kryptonite. In addition to news and series, TV B92 introduced more sports programming and was broadcasting many tennis events featuring Serbian players (Grand Slam tournaments, ATP Masters 1000 series, ATP World Tour Finals), football (UEFA Europa League, La Liga) and basketball (Liga ABA). But however, its purple crystal-kryptonite logo was short-lived and was only used for 12 months of believing in B92

====2012–2017====
In 2012, TV B92 got its fourth and final logo which was a purple cube with a golden flash. This purple cube had first arrived in Belgrade on 16 March 2012 when TV B92 made a discussion about the purple cube at Knez Mihailova Street in Belgrade. From 17 March 2012 to 18 March 2012, TV B92 began to air some promos with the purple cube and was advertising something. Later, Vesti B92 announced on 18 March 2012 at 11 pm, that TV B92 would implement a new logo and renewed on-air look on 19 March 2012. Finally on 19 March 2012, TV B92 discontinued its purple crystal-kryptonite logo and introduced a new logo that consists of a purple cube that has a golden flash as well as the &quot;B92&quot; wordmark are in the center of the purple cube, but is now spelled with a lowercase letter &quot;b&quot;, known as b92. The purple cube was the last logo to carry TV B92&#x27;s franchise and it was used for 5 years from 19 March 2012 to 10 September 2017.

On 18 March 2013, TV B92 aired the popular Croatian telenovela &quot;Larin izbor&quot; and on 11 September 2013, that same year, it started showing Turkish television drama for the first time as the last major Serbian commercial TV station to do so.

A year later on 3 November 2014, TV B92 started broadcasting in 16:9.

At last on 18 December 2016, the cable channel B92 Info has ceased to exist.

====2017–2020: Rename to O2====

In late October 2014, Serbian newspaper &quot;Blic&quot; reported that TV B92 will be possibly renamed to O2 TV (stylized O2.TV) by the end of 2014, with the result made after a petition made by former TV B92 employees telling the network to change its name, and around 1,500 people signed for the petition. One last step by that decision was the removal of the Serbian most popular political late-night talk show &quot;Utisak nedelje&quot;. Many public figures and media organizations protested stating that the removal of talk show was politically motivated by the ruling leader Aleksandar Vučić. TV B92 denied those claims labeling them as &quot;false claims&quot;. Three months later, talk show author Olja Bećković confirmed those claims and accused Vučić as a man behind the removal of the talk show.

The planned channel was said to be an entertainment-oriented TV station, but the logo and was unknown at the time. It was also said that the change would not affect the cable channel B92 Info, &quot;which will continue to air with this name&quot;, and Radio B92 would continue to work in the same format.

Three years later on 11 September 2017, TV B92 completed the proposed re-branding and started broadcasting under the name of &quot;O2.TV&quot;. It was also announced that the web portal &quot;b92.net&quot; would continue operating.

====2020–present: Restoration of the B92 brand====

After three years as O2, the television restored B92 brand on 1 March 2020. A new visual identity was introduced, with the logo featuring lowercase &quot;b92&quot; in a flat design. The programming concept, advertised as &quot;refreshed&quot;, did not change substantially.

==Ownership==
In November 2010, a Greek-Swedish joint-venture Astonko d.o.o. purchased 84.99% of shares from MDLF and NCA. B92 Trust retained 11.35% of shares and small shareholders had 3.66% of total shares. In September 2015, Greek ANT1 Group became the majority shareholder of TV B92. At the time, Greek media company ANT1 Group was also majority shareholder of Prva Srpska Televizija in Serbia, TV station with national coverage.

In December 2018, former owner of Kopernikus Technology purchased B92 and Prva Srpska Televizija from ANT1 Group for 180 million euros, one month after Telekom Srbija bought Kopernikus Technology for 190 million euros. The transaction between state-owned Telekom Srbija and Kopernikus made public outrage in Serbia as Kopenikus&#x27; market worth at the time of purchase was several times lower than the amount it was purchased for; it was also revealed that major stakeholder in company was a close relative to ruling Serbian Progressive Party officer.

==Other active segments==
===B92.net===
B92.net was established as OpenNet in late 1995 as the Internet division of Radio B92. In its first few months of operation a dial-up connection with Amsterdam provider XS4ALL was used. At the beginning of 1996, OpenNet became Yugoslavia&#x27;s first Internet provider, using an analogue leased line from XS4ALL and six local dial-up lines.

OpenNet also supported the local network of Radio B92, ANEM Radio and ANEM Television by providing non-stop live Internet broadcast of programs of Radio B92 and TV B92, together with the distribution of audio and video materials among the ANEM radio and television stations. In this way, everything produced by ANEM and Radio B92 was available on the Internet.

During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, when government representatives raided the Radio B92 premises and disabled its transmitter, OpenNet continued to broadcast the radio program over the Internet. The signal was rebroadcast via satellite and by several radio stations in neighboring countries. All of this was done with support from RealNetworks.

Today, B92.net has English and Serbian version of the website. It has been the leading Serbian Internet site from 1996 to 2010s. At its peak, the average number of page views per day exceeded 1 million, while the daily average number of visitors peaked at 200,000. At its peak, Alexa.com ranked B92 site at the 917th global place.

As of December 2018, Alexa.com ranked B92.net at the 4,730th place, while also being 9th ranked in Serbia.

===B92 Fond===
Over the years, B92 has also been successfully running the Humanitarian Fund. One of its most notable actions were &quot;Battle for the Babies&quot;, &quot;Battle for the Maternity Wards&quot;, &quot;Give blood—save life!&quot; and others.

===Music and book publishing===
B92 also runs a record label, although in recent years its releases are few and far between.

<text>Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, originally the Pentagon City Mall, is an enclosed regional shopping mall in the Pentagon City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, near Interstate 395 and Hayes Street. Its Metro level is directly connected to the Pentagon City station on the Blue and Yellow Lines of the Washington Metro. The mall features Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom, and also houses the Ritz-Carlton Pentagon City hotel.

Completed in October 1989, the Fashion Centre is the largest enclosed shopping mall in Arlington, housing 164 retailers and restaurants. The Washington Tower office building, formerly leased by MCI, is part of the mall property; its lower levels are part of the mall.

The mall was developed by Melvin Simon &amp; Associates with real-estate investment firm Rose Associates as part of the 1976 Pentagon City Phased-Development Site Plan. It opened in fall 1989 with 860,000 sq. ft. of space on 25 acres, with Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom as anchor stores (original plans were for Bambergers) and approximately 150 other stores, and a 4,524-capacity parking garage; the office tower part of the complex opened a little later, and the 345-room hotel the following year. The interior featured a white color scheme and skylit atria extending in two wings from the central courtyard. The mall theater, Loews Pentagon City 6, closed on January 1, 2003, and was replaced by a clothing store.

Expansion of the mall, including outward-facing stores on Hayes Street, was approved by the county board in 2013, at which time it had more than 170 stores. It was completed in 2016. , the mall had of space.

On March 23, 2023, it was announced that IKEA will be opening a 5,000 sqft &quot;Plan and Order&quot; specialty format, the first in the Washington, D.C. region. It will feature interior design planning among IKEA specialists with any ordered furniture then delivered to a customer&#x27;s residence.

Simon Property Group, the successor to the Simon shopping mall interests, subsequently raised its stake; it jointly owned the mall with Institutional Mall Investors, a joint venture of Miller Capital Advisory and CalPERS; , it had a 42.5% interest. The Ritz-Carlton hotel is separately owned, by Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts.

<text>Sixteen Mile Creek (also known as Sixteenmile Creek) is a long tributary of the Missouri River in western Montana in the United States. It forms at the confluence of the Middle and South forks of Sixteen Mile Creek, approximately east of Maudlow. The canyon through which it travels is known as &quot;Sixteen Mile Canyon&quot;. The abandoned grade of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (&quot;the Milwaukee Road&quot;) parallels the creek through the canyon; the canyon is referred to as &quot;Montana Canyon&quot; in Milwaukee Road promotional material.

Sixteen Mile Creek rises in the Lewis and Clark National Forest in the Crazy Mountains in southeastern Meagher County. It flows generally west, south of the Big Belt Mountains, and southwest, past Maudlow and joins the Missouri southeast of Toston, at the site of the ghost town of Lombard.

Sixteen Mile Creek is one of the more historically important areas in Montana. Its name derives from the fact that it enters the Missouri River downstream from Three Forks, Montana. The rail bed of the original Montana Railroad runs through this creek canyon, which includes some really outstanding scenery. The Milwaukee Road abandoned this line in 1980.

<doc id="533562" wikidata="Q570450" url="?curid=533562" title="Telugu script">
<text>Telugu script (), an abugida from the Brahmic family of scripts, is used to write the Telugu language, a Dravidian language spoken in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as well as several other neighbouring states. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. The Telugu script is also widely used for writing Sanskrit texts and to some extent the Gondi language. It gained prominence during the Eastern Chalukyas also known as Vengi Chalukya era. It also shares extensive similarities with the Kannada script.

==History==
The Brahmi script used by Mauryan kings eventually reached the Krishna River delta and would give rise to the Bhattiprolu script found on an urn purported to contain Lord Buddha&#x27;s relics. Buddhism spread to East Asia from the nearby ports of Ghantasala and Masulipatnam (ancient Maisolos of Ptolemy and Masalia of Periplus).Kadamba script developed by the Kadamba dynasty was derived from the Brahmi script and later evolved into the Telugu-Kannada script after the 7th century. The Telugu and Kannada scripts then separated by around 1300 CE. The Muslim historian and scholar Al-Biruni referred to both the Telugu language as well as its script as &quot;Andhri&quot;.

==Vowels==
Telugu uses sixteen vowels, each of which has both an independent form and a diacritic form used with consonants to create syllables. The language makes a distinction between short and long vowels.


The independent form is used when the vowel occurs at the beginning of a word or syllable, or is a complete syllable in itself (example: a, u, o). The diacritic form is added to consonants (represented by the dotted circle) to form a consonant-vowel syllable (example: ka, kr̥, mo). does not have a diacritic form, because this vowel is already inherent in all of the consonants. The other diacritic vowels are added to consonants to change their pronunciation to that of the vowel.

Examples:
==Consonants==

Subscript letters are used in consonant clusters and geminate consonants.

===Marginal and archaic consonants===
* Additionally there are ౘ (ĉa) and ౙ (ẑa) for /t͡sa, d͡za/ which are rarely used, letters for &lt;c, j&gt; are commonly used instead. They are referred in Telugu as dantya ca and dantya ja respectively. During the last century, ఱ (ṟa) known as banḍi ra in Telugu has been dropped. This letter is referred to as banḍi ra as opposed to ర (ra) which is referred to as repha.
The letter for a voiced alveolar plosive is found in some inscriptions, it is thought to have been distinguished from the trill ఱ (ṟa) intervocalically rarely; its mostly found after a nasal as in మూన్ౚు (mūnḏu).

==Other diacritics==

There are also several other diacritics used in the Telugu script. ్ mutes the vowel of a consonant, so that only the consonant is pronounced. ం represents a corresponding class nasal sound when followed by a consonant from that class (i.e., the last column of the corresponding consonant row for the first five rows of the consonants table); when not followed by anything or by a consonant from the first five rows of the consonant table, it represents a true nasal sound. ఁ represents a historically used that is no longer pronounced, or a nasalized vowel when transliterating other languages (e.g., Hindi) into the Telugu script. ః adds a voiceless breath after the vowel or syllable it is attached to.

Examples:
===Marginal and archaic diacritics and signs===
◌఼: Telugu nuqta.

ఽ: Telugu avagraha.

ౝ: Nakara pollu.

ఀ: The combining candrabindu nasal vowel diacritic of the Telugu script.

ఄ: Combining anusvara above.

౷: Siddham sign.

౿: Tuumu sign.

==Places of articulation ==
There are five classifications of passive articulations:
: Kaṇṭhya: Velar
: Tālavya: Palatal
: Mūrdhanya: Retroflex
: Dantya: Dental
: Ōshtya: Labial

Apart from that, other places are combinations of the above five: 
: Dantōsthya: Labio-dental (E.g.: v)
: Kantatālavya: E.g.: Diphthong e
: Kantōsthya: labial-velar (E.g.: Diphthong o)

There are three places of active articulation:
: Jihvāmūlam: tongue root, for velar
: Jihvāmadhyam: tongue body, for palatal
: Jihvāgram: tip of tongue, for cerebral and dental
: : lower lip, for labial

The attempt of articulation of consonants (Uccāraṇa Prayatnam) is of two types,
: Bāhya Prayatnam: External effort
:: Spṛṣṭa: Plosive
:: Īshat Spṛṣṭa: Approximant
:: Īshat Saṃvṛta: Fricative
: Abhyantara Prayatnam: Internal effort
:: Alpaprānam: Unaspirated
:: Mahāprānam: Aspirated
:: Śvāsa: Unvoiced
:: Nādam: Voiced

=== Articulation of consonants ===
Articulation of consonants is the logical combination of components in the two prayatnams. The below table gives a view upon articulation of consonants.

The Telugu script has generally regular conjuncts, with trailing consonants taking a subjoined form, often losing the talakattu (the v-shaped headstroke). The following table shows all two-consonant conjuncts and one three-consonant conjunct, but individual conjuncts may differ between fonts. These are referred in Telugu as vattulu (వత్తులు).

===Consonants with vowel diacritics===
The consonants with vowel diacritics are referred to in the Telugu language as guṇintālu (). The word &quot;Guṇita&quot; refers to &#x27;multiplying oneself&#x27;. Therefore, each consonant sound can be multiplied with vowel sounds to produce vowel diacritics. The vowel diacritics along with their symbols and names are given below.

The following table contains the consonants with vowel diacritics in the Telugu language.
==Numerals==

NOTE: , , and are used also for , , , , etc. and , , and are also used for , , , , etc.

==Unicode==

Telugu script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Telugu is U+0C00–U+0C7F:

In contrast to a syllabic script such as katakana, where one Unicode code point represents the glyph for one syllable, Telugu combines multiple code points to generate the glyph for one syllable, using complex font rendering rules.

== iOS character crash bug ==
On February 12, 2018, a bug in the iOS operating system was reported that caused iOS devices to crash if a particular Telugu character was displayed. The character is a combination of the characters &quot;జ&quot;, &quot;్&quot;, &quot;ఞ&quot;, &quot;ా&quot; and The Zero-Width Non-Joiner character which looks combined like this &quot;జ్ఞా&quot;. Apple confirmed a fix for iOS 11.3 and macOS 10.13.4.

<doc id="533563" wikidata="Q60230" url="?curid=533563" title="Pearls Before Swine (comics)">
<text>Pearls Before Swine (also known as Pearls) is an American comic strip written and illustrated by Stephan Pastis. The series began on December 31, 2001. It chronicles the daily lives of an ensemble cast of suburban anthropomorphic animals: Pig, Rat, Zebra, Goat, and a fraternity of crocodiles, as well as a number of supporting characters, one of whom is Pastis himself. Each character represents an aspect of Pastis&#x27;s personality and worldview. The daily and Sunday comic strip is distributed by Andrews McMeel Syndication (by United Feature Syndicate until 2011).

The strip&#x27;s style is notable for its black comedy, simplistic artwork, self-deprecating fourth wall meta-humor, social commentary, mockery of itself or other comic strips, and occasional elaborate stories leading to a pun.
== Publication history ==
Before creating &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;, Pastis worked as a lawyer in California. Bored in his law school classes, he doodled a rat, eventually casting it in a non-syndicated comic strip he called &quot;Rat&quot;. Rat became one of the main characters in &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;. Pastis continued to draw comics; the character Pig came from a failed strip, &quot;The Infirm&quot;. In 1999, Pastis first submitted &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; to syndicates. Several expressed interest and three accepted it, but they could not convince their sales staff that it was marketable. Amy Lago, an editor at United Media, saw the strip&#x27;s potential and launched it on the United Media website in November 2000 to see what kind of response it would generate. Pastis recalled in 2009:
&quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; debuted in 2001 as a website strip under United Feature Syndicate. When Scott Adams, creator of &quot;Dilbert&quot; and a supporter of the strip, told his fans about &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;, interest skyrocketed, and the strip was taken to print. Aiding Pastis with the strip&#x27;s artistic elements was Darby Conley, creator of the comic strip &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot;.

United Feature Syndicate launched the strip in newspapers on December 31, 2001, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. On January 7, 2002, &quot;Pearls&quot; was running in approximately 150 papers. Since 2011, it has been appearing in 750 newspapers worldwide.

In January 2021, Andrews McMeel delayed the circulation of a comic arc that depicted a fictional American coup d&#x27;état, worrying that readers might think of it as inspired by the 2021 United States Capitol attack. The arc was postponed to August/September 2021, and reruns were published in place of the originally scheduled week in January. Pastis and the company both clarified that the strips were a pure coincidence and had been drawn before the riots happened.

==Influences==
&quot;Pearls&quot;″s style and humor are inspired by several comic strips, chiefly &quot;Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Dilbert&quot;, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, &quot;Bloom County&quot; and &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Pastis has drawn tributes to these influences in his strip. When asked in an interview whether his profession as an attorney inspired the humor in the comic, he said, &quot;I was very unhappy as a lawyer, and humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness. ... if you dislike what you&#x27;re doing to the extent that I did, it gives you the impetus to get out.&quot;

Conley helped teach Pastis the technical aspects of cartooning. The two remain friends, sometimes poking fun at each other in their strips.

==Characters==

This is a partial list of the strip&#x27;s major and secondary characters:

===Pig===

====Personality====
Pig is a gentle, optimistic, but dimwitted pig. He is also quite immature, with Pastis stating that he views Pig &quot;as a little kid&quot;. He believes that there is good in every being, even his cynical housemate Rat. Pig&#x27;s lack of knowledge often leads him to misunderstand world issues and social norms; this is compounded by the fact that, when they are explained to him, he frequently mishears or misinterprets important parts of the explanation. Pig also tends to be easily manipulated by Rat&#x27;s writings; he tends to uncritically believe them and make strident proclamations of support for Rat&#x27;s viewpoints.

Pig has a deep love for food. On several occasion, he has befriended sentient food items; he has also dated a maple syrup bottle named &quot;Ms. Bootyworth&quot; and founded a religion centered on cheese. He also regularly eats bacon, despite being a pig himself. In addition to his voracious eating habits, Pig is generally slothful and avoids physical activity, causing him to be obese. While he is generally content with his body, he occasionally attempts to lose weight; however, he usually takes only minimal efforts to do so.

Pig has an on-again, off-again relationship with a female pig known as Pigita. Pig&#x27;s tendency to misspeak often leads him to offend Pigita by unwittingly making rude or sexually forward remarks; Pig&#x27;s routinely immature behavior is another source of friction in their relationship. Pig tends to get along with his family, though he tends to receive fairly little respect from them.

====Character history====
Pig&#x27;s beginnings lie in &quot;The Infirm&quot;, a third attempt by Pastis to get syndicated. In this strip, Pastis based the story on a lawyer named Bob Grossman who screwed up a lawsuit brought by a sausage company and was forced to work at the farm the sausage company owned until he made up the difference. Grossman worked with pigs, one of whom told him he was &quot;screwed&quot; because the farmer was only paying minimum wage.

Although &quot;The Infirm&quot; was rejected, Pastis liked the pig characters so much that he eventually simplified the artwork and one became known simply as &quot;Pig&quot; in the first &quot;Pearls&quot; strips Pastis sent to the syndicators. In fact, it was Pig&#x27;s addition to the strip that caused it to be known as &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; – Rat would consistently be imparting his &quot;pearls of wisdom&quot; on Pig only to have it fall on deaf ears. (Pastis also said this was a play on a Biblical verse, part of which reads &quot;neither cast ye pearls before swine&quot;.)

===Rat===

====Personality====
Rat is a megalomaniacal, misanthropic rat. He is contemptuous toward almost everyone he meets, including the general public, his friends and associates, and even the author of his own comic. Rat holds a high opinion of his own intelligence, frequently inventing sweeping theories about human nature, but ironically he is often fairly poorly informed himself; Pastis describes this trait as Rat&#x27;s &quot;exaggerated sense of self&quot;, which he says is &quot;key&quot; to Rat&#x27;s character. In addition to his arrogance, Rat is high-strung and impatient, and frequently unleashes angry tirades, physical violence, or elaborate revenge plots against people who anger him.

Rat has held numerous jobs throughout the comic&#x27;s history. Most frequently, he is seen as a barista at a fictional café called Joe&#x27;s Roastery. Though Rat tends to be openly rude or dismissive to his customers, he continues to hold this job, because Joe&#x27;s Roastery has a stringent diversity policy that prevents them from firing the only rat in their staff. In addition to this job, Rat also frequently launches get-rich-quick schemes and runs for political office. His political campaigns are usually unsuccessful, although he did become President of the United States in a 2017 storyline. Rat&#x27;s political stances are generally militaristic (e.g. advocating the invasion of France or Mexico); Pastis has described Rat&#x27;s politics as &quot;somewhere to the right of Dick Cheney&quot;.

Rat is also prolifically creative, and is frequently seen attempting to write novels or draw comics. Recurring characters in Rat&#x27;s writing include Angry Bob, a character who tends to die violently while pursuing happiness and inner peace; Elly Elephant and Henry Hippo, who typically appear in cynical parables about romance; and a nameless, corrupt congressman. Rat has also drawn comics about a misanthropic, alcoholic donkey named Danny Donkey, who briefly came to life in a 2006 storyline.

Though Rat seems to dislike or disdain everyone he meets – including his family, who he generally strives to avoid whenever possible – he does occasionally show moments of kindness. Pig is the most frequent recipient of these moments, as Pastis often uses them &quot;to answer the question, &#x27;Why would Pig be friends with this guy?&#x27;&quot; Rat has also nursed romantic feelings for Pig&#x27;s sister Farina during her rare appearances in the strip.

====Character history====
Pastis started drawing Rat in law school, often killing him off for the sake of humor. He would often doodle Rat in classes while bored, and in his early stages Rat was more of a depressed, philosophical character as opposed to the cynical egomaniac he is today. Pastis titled his doodled strips &quot;Rat&quot; after his title character.

Later, as he began attempting to get syndicated, Pastis added a second character as Rat&#x27;s companion. This resulted in the creation of Poe, an amorphous blob that resembled nothing. Newspapers deemed &quot;Rat&quot; too depressing and Pastis stopped drawing the strip.

Rat was later put into another one of Pastis&#x27;s comics, &quot;Bradbury Road&quot;, which was also rejected.

&quot;Bradbury Road&quot; is the story of Gus, a ten-year-old boy who is befriended by Rat, a cynical rodent who gnaws his way through the wall into Gus&#x27; room. Gus, the child of divorced parents, lives with his mother and very rarely sees his father. Reserved and slightly awkward, he spends a lot of time in his own room. For those times when Gus is not around, Rat talks with Jingles, a stuffed, court jester doll that lives on a shelf in the boy&#x27;s room.

After some rejection, Pastis eventually wrote &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;, an attempt to revive &quot;Rat&quot; with a less depressing tone. Poe was replaced by Pig, and began syndication by United Media on December 31, 2001.

===Goat===

====Personality====
Goat is an intelligent, well-read goat who enjoys discussing world news and philosophical issues. He frequently clashes with Rat due to Rat&#x27;s poorly informed and relentlessly cynical viewpoints. Goat also attempts to teach Pig about various matters, generally without success. For this reason, he is described on the &quot;Pearls&quot; website as &quot;the voice of reason that often goes unheard&quot;.

Despite his intellect and his generally amiable personality, Goat tends to be socially inept – he is usually uncomfortable around new people, and has fairly little knowledge of pop culture. For this reason, while Goat regularly pursues romantic relationships, his efforts tend to be sabotaged by his awkward behavior. Consequently, when left to his own devices, Goat often prefers to read on his own rather than to spend his time sociably. He also maintains a blog that consistently receives few or no pageviews, a fact for which Rat often mocks him.

====Name====
As with most of other animal characters in the strip, Goat is only referred to by the name of his species. However, in a storyline where Goat travels home and visits his mother, it is revealed that &quot;Goat&quot; is a stage name and that his real name is Paris. This name was chosen as a tribute to Stephan Pastis&#x27;s grandfather, Paris Tripodes.

====Character history====
Goat was the third main character to debut in the strip and was the first of two conceived specifically for &quot;Pearls&quot; (as opposed to Rat and Pig, who as noted appeared in Pastis&#x27; rejected strips). He was originally supposed to be a bear, but after the syndicates rejected the idea Pastis reworked the character into a goat. He first appeared on January 18, 2002. In his earliest appearances, he had a white goatee, but Pastis removed the goatee from Goat&#x27;s design in the mid-2000s.

===Zebra===

====Personality====
Zebra is a supportive and caring zebra, who is often seen either writing to his predators or talking about recent deaths. Zebra was the fourth main character to be introduced, as Pastis said in &quot;Sgt. Piggy&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Comic&quot; that his original intent was for Zebra to be in a limited run. His popularity forced Pastis to include him full-time.

In his earliest appearance, Zebra only communicated with his predators by sending letters back and forth, but he began interacting with them face-to-face after the fraternity of crocodiles moved into his neighborhood in January 2005. Zebra generally serves as a straight man to the crocodiles&#x27; schemes, pointing out the various ways in which their plots to eat him are doomed to fail. Zebra&#x27;s other neighbors include Larry the crocodile&#x27;s family and a pride of lions. Zebra also owns a pet cat named Snuffles, who commits a wide variety of crimes despite his innocent appearance.

In addition to his communication with predators, Zebra often writes to his relatives on the savannah with potential strategies to protect them against predation; however, these plans consistently fail. Not much is known about the surviving members of his family except for their names (usually named after Pastis&#x27; own relatives). Zebra has a brother named Peter, nicknamed &quot;Stumpy&quot; after a crocodile ate his left leg, and a niece named Joy in memory of Stephan Pastis&#x27; grandmother. Zebra has also called his father a few times, who is suggested to struggle with modern technology.

====Character history====
Zebra debuted in the February 4, 2002 strip and was only scheduled to be a limited run character. His debut saw him trying to sell cookies to Rat and Pig to raise money to help save his herd, but Rat declined because of not wanting to mess with natural selection. Reader reaction to Zebra eventually made Pastis decide to make Zebra a permanent character.

===The Crocodiles===
The Zeeba Zeeba Eata Fraternity is an all-crocodile fraternity that lives next door to Zebra. They consistently make attempts to kill and eat Zebra but, despite believing themselves to be capable hunters, the crocodiles always undermine their schemes due to their collective stupidity. The crocodiles&#x27; plans generally culminate with them killing each other instead; dozens of crocodiles have died over the strip&#x27;s run. The crocodiles&#x27; plans are often elaborate and convoluted, but even so, they never successfully conceal the fact that their ultimate goal is to capture and eat Zebra. Because of their large numbers and short lifespans, most crocodiles do not have individual personalities outside of their schemes.

The crocodiles are known for their distinctive speech pattern; Pastis represents their speech with lowercase letters and phonetic spelling. They also pronounce some words in nonstandard ways, such as referring to Zebra as &quot;zeeba&quot; and themselves as &quot;crockydiles&quot;. They often begin scenes with the catch phrase &quot;Hullooo, zeeba neighba!&quot; In describing the origin of the crocodiles&#x27; speech, Pastis has stated, &quot;My inspiration was probably from a Saturday Night Live skit that had Tarzan and Frankenstein trying to talk [to each other].&quot; More intelligent crocodiles, such as Larry&#x27;s wife and son, usually speak standard English rather than using the crocodiles&#x27; register.

==== Larry, Patty and Junior ====
Larry (born February 16, 1969), his beehive-sporting wife Patty, and their son Junior, are a family of crocodiles who live near Zebra and the Zeeba Zeeba Eata fraternity house. Though &quot;Larry&quot; was originally one of the stock names that Pastis gave to the Zeeba Zeeba Eata crocodiles, he is now largely uninvolved with the fraternity.

Pastis describes Larry as &quot;dumb like Pig, but mean-spirited and rude&quot;. Larry is also egotistical and defensive about his hunting abilities; he tries to portray himself as a skilled hunter and provider, but to keep up this impression, he frequently perpetrates schemes such as claiming fast food products to be zebra meat. Larry also holds old-fashioned views on gender roles, which frequently leads to tension in his marriage. Larry is also hostile and dismissive of most authority figures. Despite his negative attitudes toward most people, Larry has sincere love for his son, and the two have a close relationship.

Patty is far more intelligent than Larry, and is very critical of her husband&#x27;s idiocy and self-centeredness.

Junior is a studious and highly intelligent young crocodile; he is also a pacifist and a vegetarian, as he thinks that killing wildlife is immoral. Junior is often frustrated by his father&#x27;s stupidity, though he generally receives it in good humor; similarly, Larry is often confused by Junior&#x27;s pacifist beliefs.

Junior has gradually aged over the course of the strip, and is currently a college student.

===Stephan Pastis===
(debut: June 1, 2003) – Pastis himself appears self-referentially in many strips as the cartoonist of the strip, usually discussing his experiences as a cartoonist or his childhood and background. His characters&#x27; attitudes toward him range from indifference to pity to contempt; Rat is particularly hostile toward him. Pastis particularly tends to offend his characters by writing elaborate pun strips; when forced to utter a convoluted pun, the characters generally follow it up by berating Pastis or inflicting violence upon him.

Pastis often depicts himself as smoking and drinking beer; the real Pastis does not smoke, although he does drink. In &quot;The Crass Menagerie&quot;, Pastis notes that people have criticized his character for seeming to glamorize smoking, though Pastis states that he intends the smoking to make him look more like a &quot;loser&quot;.

The fictionalized version of Pastis split from his wife in 2014; this storyline led to widespread speculation that the real Pastis was going through a divorce, but he has since clarified that he remains married.

===Guard Duck===

====Personality====
(Debut: March 14, 2005) Guard Duck (formerly known as &quot;Lil Guard Duck&quot;) is a violent duck, hired by Pig because the cost of a proper guard dog was too high. Initially simply a violent, sociopathic duck, he later took on the persona of a jaded soldier and mercenary, seeing the world as his battlefield. He frequently blows up the neighbors&#x27; property, assuming he is at war against the neighbors, and suggests militaristic solutions for common and simple neighborhood problems. Guard Duck sees Pig as his commander, often referring to him as &quot;sir&quot;; accordingly, Pig is often forced to mitigate Guard Duck&#x27;s ability to cause damage, typically by locking him in a clothes hamper. Pastis has emphasized that Guard Duck has a predominantly &quot;cool persona&quot; in that, while he is prone to violence, he does not &quot;freak out or panic&quot;.

In one storyline, Guard Duck fell in love with a non-anthropomorphic duck named Maura, who flew away from him for the winter and failed to return for over a year. Guard Duck thought he had lost her forever, as he had never learned how to fly, but one day she returned to him. He resigned his &quot;commission&quot; shortly thereafter and traveled to Paris with Maura, but soon afterward, Maura left him to work for Aflac.

Guard Duck frequently collaborates with Zebra&#x27;s amoral pet cat, Snuffles, to perpetrate criminal schemes and occasional coups d&#x27;etat.

===Minor characters===
*Pigita (debut: July 22, 2002) – Pig&#x27;s on-and-off girlfriend, characterized by mood swings in her early appearances. She is frequently frustrated by Pig&#x27;s immaturity, seeming to wish he would propose to her or make a similar gesture of commitment. They have apparently been dating since September 6, 2000, although Pigita frequently dumps Pig and takes him back.
*Snuffles the Cat (debut: September 30, 2007) — A long-haired cat owned by Zebra. The crocodiles originally gave Snuffles to Zebra, intending for Snuffles to kill him, but the two ended up getting along. Snuffles now occupies his time committing various crimes and assisting in Guard Duck&#x27;s schemes.
*Comic Strip Censors – The Comic Strip Censors are a group of sophisticated men, recognizable by the labeled top hats they wear, who appear when potentially offensive material is referenced in the comic. Rat frequently makes innuendos to deliberately provoke them.
* Jef the Cyclist (originally Jeff the Cyclist) (debut: June 2, 2009) – A pompous cyclist who sees cyclists, and himself in particular, as inherently superior to all other people. He is rigorously obsessed with fitness, and describes non-cyclists as &quot;commoners&quot; and &quot;scum&quot;. Pastis changed the spelling of Jef&#x27;s name as a reference to Jef Mallett, the cartoonist of &quot;Frazz&quot;, who is an avid cyclist and a friend of Pastis.
*Angry Bob (debut: September 15, 2002) - A book character created by Rat, Angry Bob is a 39-year-old man who is constantly battling anger problems and attempts to find happiness and inner peace, only to meet a violent death at the end of every story, or suffer some other unfortunate fate, such as being arrested by the TSA at the end of one story. When Goat questions Rat on how Angry Bob&#x27;s stories continue despite the character dying, Rat shows him the opening line of the new volume he is working on - &quot;Angry Bob undied.&quot; - to which Goat replies, &quot;That&#x27;s the stupidest thing I&#x27;ve ever read.&quot; Angry Bob is usually not physically seen in the strip, but on rare occasions, he does physically appear, although his face is never shown.
*Danny Donkey (debut: April 16, 2006)– A book character created by Rat, he is a misanthropic, alcoholic donkey who hates everybody else and spends most of his time sitting around drinking beer in his underwear, or smoking. On some occasions, his hatred of people will drive him to the point of killing them. Pastis conceived Danny Donkey as &quot;the anti-Hobbes... a stuffed animal who came to life but instead of being kind and wise was drunk and addicted to nicotine.&quot;
*Elly Elephant and Henry Hippo – Two book characters created by Rat, they are an elephant and hippopotamus who date each other. Elly has an idealistic, romantic nature, and often finds her idealism betrayed by Henry Hippo&#x27;s apathetic approach to their relationship, often leading her to retaliate violently against him. Elly debuted first in a solo story written by Rat, and, while usually seen with Henry Hippo, has made a small amount of appearances without Henry since his introduction. 
*Neighbor Bob – A bald man who lives next to Rat and Pig. He is frequently mentioned, but is usually only seen in person when he has a dispute with Rat over neighborhood issues. He is most often a victim of Rat&#x27;s hostility, but if sufficiently provoked, will also respond in kind.
*Gary, the coffee shop manager (debut: July 10, 2006) – Gary is Rat&#x27;s long-suffering manager at Joe&#x27;s Roastery. Powerless to fire Rat due to the cafe&#x27;s stringent diversity policies, Gary is regularly forced to try to cajole Rat into treating his customers appropriately.
*Andy (debut: June 16, 2007) – A dog who makes big plans for his life, only to have them dashed by the fact he is tied to a pole in his backyard. Despite the repeated crushing of his hopes, Andy retains a hopeful personality. Pastis describes Andy as &quot;a metaphor meant to symbolize how we learn to live with the limitations imposed on us&quot;. For a period of time Andy shared the backyard with a female dog named Olive, who like Andy was chained to a post. She left him after her chain broke in the middle of the night. Andy once briefly escaped as well, to visit his dying father in the hospital. Andy and Olive are named for cartoonist Paige Braddock&#x27;s pet dachshunds.
*Farina (debut: August 19, 2002) – Pig&#x27;s germophobic sister, who lives in a bubble to limit her exposure to pathogens. She had a romantic relationship with Rat, but left him abruptly. In &quot;Sgt. Piggy&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Comic&quot;, Pastis said that he only draws her infrequently because her bubble requires a drafting compass to draw.
*Viking Figurines (debut: November 7, 2005) – Pig has miniature Viking figurines that write in diaries and practice non-manly habits. Rat often attempts to push the Vikings into more archetypally Viking lifestyles, through tactics like showing them WWE or singing violent songs.
*Jeffy Keane – A character from &quot;The Family Circus&quot; who shows up from time to time in &quot;Pearls&quot; for various reasons. Pastis often draws him in situations that are antithetical to Jeffy&#x27;s character such as assaulting Pig or &quot;battling demons&quot;.
*Wise Ass on the Hill - He is a wise donkey who gives advice to people who question him. An old anthropomorphic ass who wears glasses and is sometimes mean, he sometimes even kicks people off his hill. Rat and Pig normally visit him and ask for advice.
*Max and Zach (debut: May 31, 2007) - Two lions that live next door on the other side to Zebra. Unlike the crocs, they don&#x27;t try to hunt Zebra, as their wives are the ones who do the hunting. Max and Zach often give Zebra tips in order to survive.
*Chuckie (debut: December 4, 2002) - A friend of Goat, Chuckie is a non-anthropomorphic sheep who only communicates by saying &quot;Baah&quot;.
*Annie May (debut: November 14, 2005) - A sea anemone who wants to kill Pig for unknown reasons. His name leads to a lot of wordplay in the strip. He eventually is crushed by Rat closing the garage door and splits into two female anemones, Annette and Ann O&#x27;Meade.
*John and Jennifer (debut: December 13, 2005) - Two seals looking for a safe place to live from predators. Zebra told them that their neighborhood was safe for them as the only predators there were ones he himself had to deal with, however it was quickly found out a Killer Whale lives there as well.
*The Killer Whale (debut: December 13, 2005) - A whale who tries to eat John and Jennier multiple times but is unsuccessful. He is killed when he eats a meatloaf with a bomb made by Annette and Ann O&#x27;Meade inside meant for Pig, but later comes back to life, being explained as him &quot;undying&quot;.
*Alphonse (debut: July 5, 2004) - A needy porcupine who begs for attention, even annoying characters like Pig. He often threatens suicide, which Rat in particular hates.

==Style==
Artistically, &quot;Pearls&quot; is simple. Pastis stated, &quot;People say that they like my strip&#x27;s simplicity, but I&#x27;m doing the best I can to just to get up to that level. I&#x27;m not dumbing the art down.&quot;

&quot;Pearls&quot; is a meta-comic in that it often satirizes the comics medium, and its characters frequently break the fourth wall. Characters frequently communicate with the author or with characters from other strips. Some strips are based on the premise that the characters live in a comic strip: for example, the strip published on January 14, 2008, had &quot;roof fish&quot; sitting on top of the panel fishing for the characters, and other strips have had smeared newsprint or beer affect the appearance of the strip.

&quot;Pearls&quot; will often also mock older strips, such as &quot;Cathy&quot; and &quot;The Family Circus&quot;. The frequent comedic jabs at long-running comic strips has earned Pastis the disdain of many comic artists, which the author referenced in a storyline where the &quot;Pearls&quot; cast is not invited to the 75th-anniversary crossover party of &quot;Blondie&quot;.

Pastis will often employ a shaggy dog story, using a great amount of dialogue to spin an elaborate premise often resolved with a character&#x27;s unforeseen death or near death. A variation known as a feghoot builds to an intentionally bad pun in the penultimate panel, with the final panel showing the cartoon version of Pastis as the target of criticism, hostility, or even physical violence from the characters, usually Rat.

&quot;Pearls&quot; uses dark humor, at times involving topics such as death, depression and human suffering.

==Other media==
In an interview on &quot;The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch&quot; that aired on February 7, 2008, Pastis mentioned that he had been approached by producers about an animated TV series based on &quot;Pearls&quot;.

In 2009, a line of &quot;Pearls&quot; plush dolls was released by Aurora World, Inc., featuring four characters (Rat, Pig, Zebra and Croc) from the comic, to which Pastis jokingly said he would use for reference when unsure how to draw the characters.

On October 20, 2010, RingTales launched their series of animated &quot;Pearls&quot; strips on Babelgum. Pastis has since begun to release these cartoons on YouTube.

==Books==
There are over a dozen &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; books, mostly strip collections and treasuries.
==Awards==
Pastis won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Division Award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip for &quot;Pearls&quot; in 2003, 2006 and 2014. He was also nominated for the award in 2002 and 2008.

Pastis was one of the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s nominees for Cartoonist of the Year in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.

Stephan Pastis won the Reuben Award for Cartoonist of the Year for 2018 for his work on &quot;Pearls&quot;.

<doc id="533568" wikidata="Q60315441" url="?curid=533568" title="Cholecystokinin">
<text>Cholecystokinin (CCK or CCK-PZ; from Greek &quot;chole&quot;, &quot;bile&quot;; &quot;cysto&quot;, &quot;sac&quot;; &quot;kinin&quot;, &quot;move&quot;; hence, &quot;move the bile-sac (gallbladder)&quot;) is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system responsible for stimulating the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin, formerly called pancreozymin, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum, the first segment of the small intestine. Its presence causes the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gallbladder, respectively.

==History==
Evidence that the small intestine controls the release of bile was uncovered as early as 1856, when French physiologist Claude Bernard showed that when dilute acetic acid was applied to the orifice of the bile duct, the duct released bile into the duodenum. In 1903, the French physiologist showed that this reflex was not mediated by the nervous system. In 1904, the French physiologist Charles Fleig showed that the discharge of bile was mediated by a substance that was conveyed by the blood. There remained the possibility that the increased flow of bile in response to the presence of acid in the duodenum might be due to secretin, which had been discovered in 1902. The problem was finally resolved in 1928 by Andrew Conway Ivy and his colleague Eric Oldberg of the Northwestern University Medical School, who found a new hormone that caused contraction of the gall bladder and that they called &quot;cholecystokinin&quot;. In 1943, Alan A. Harper and Henry S. Raper of the University of Manchester discovered a hormone that stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion and that they named &quot;pancreozymin&quot;; however, pancreozymin was subsequently found to be cholecystokinin. Swedish biochemists Johannes Erik Jorpes and Viktor Mutt undertook the monumental task of isolating and purifying porcine cholecystokinin and then determining its amino acid sequence. They finally presented porcine cholecystokinin&#x27;s amino acid sequence in 1968.

== Structure ==
Cholecystokinin is a member of the gastrin/cholecystokinin family of peptide hormones and is very similar in structure to gastrin, another gastrointestinal hormone. CCK and gastrin share the same five C-terminal amino acids. CCK is composed of varying numbers of amino acids depending on post-translational modification of the 150-amino acid precursor, preprocholecystokinin. Thus, the CCK peptide hormone exists in several forms, each identified by the number of amino acids it contains, e.g., CCK-58, CCK-33, CCK-22 and CCK-8. CCK58 assumes a helix-turn-helix configuration. Biological activity resides in the C-terminus of the peptide. Most CCK peptides have a sulfate group attached to a tyrosine located seven residues from the C-terminus (see tyrosine sulfation). This modification is crucial for the ability of CCK to activate the cholecystokinin A receptor. Nonsulfated CCK peptides also occur, which consequently cannot activate the CCK-A receptor, but their biological role remains unclear.

== Function ==
CCK plays important physiological roles both as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system and as a peptide hormone in the gut. It is the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system. CCK has been researched thoroughly for its role in digestion In addition to its role in digestion, CCK is involved in regulating various behavioral phenomena, including satiety, appetite, anxiety, thermoregulation, sexual behavior, memory, and the response to drugs of abuse, particularly within the cortex and limbic regions of the brain.

=== Gastrointestinal ===

CCK is synthesized and released by enteroendocrine cells in the mucosal lining of the small intestine (mostly in the duodenum and jejunum), called I cells, neurons of the enteric nervous system, and neurons in the brain. It is released rapidly into the circulation in response to a meal. The greatest stimulator of CCK release is the presence of fatty acids and/or certain amino acids in the chyme entering the duodenum. In addition, release of CCK is stimulated by monitor peptide (released by pancreatic acinar cells), CCK-releasing protein (via paracrine signalling mediated by enterocytes in the gastric and intestinal mucosa), and acetylcholine (released by the parasympathetic nerve fibers of the vagus nerve).

Once in the circulatory system, CCK has a relatively short half-life.

==== Digestion ====
CCK mediates digestion in the small intestine by inhibiting gastric emptying. It stimulates the acinar cells of the pancreas to release a juice rich in pancreatic digestive enzymes (hence an alternate name, &quot;pancreozymin&quot;) that catalyze the digestion of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Thus, as the levels of the substances that stimulated the release of CCK drop, the concentration of the hormone drops as well. The release of CCK is also inhibited by somatostatin and pancreatic peptide. Trypsin, a protease released by pancreatic acinar cells, hydrolyzes CCK-releasing peptide and monitor peptide, in effect turning off the additional signals to secrete CCK.

CCK also causes the increased production of hepatic bile, and stimulates the contraction of the gall bladder and the relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi (Glisson&#x27;s sphincter), resulting in the delivery of bile into the duodenal part of the small intestine. Bile salts form amphipathic lipids, micelles that emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption.

==== Satiety ====
As a peptide hormone, CCK mediates satiety by acting on the CCK receptors distributed widely throughout the central nervous system. The mechanism for hunger suppression is thought to be a decrease in the rate of gastric emptying. CCK also has stimulatory effects on the vagus nerve, effects that can be inhibited by capsaicin. The stimulatory effects of CCK oppose those of ghrelin, which has been shown to inhibit the vagus nerve.

The effects of CCK vary between individuals. For example, in rats, CCK administration significantly reduces hunger in adult males, but is slightly less effective in younger subjects, and even slightly less effective in females. The hunger-suppressive effects of CCK also are reduced in obese rats.

=== Neurological ===

CCK is found extensively throughout the central nervous system, with high concentrations found in the limbic system. CCK is synthesized as a 115 amino acid preprohormone, that is then converted into multiple isoforms. The predominant form of CCK in the central nervous system is the sulfated octapeptide, CCK-8S.

==== Anxiogenic ====
In both humans and rodents, studies clearly indicate that elevated CCK levels causes increased anxiety. The site of the anxiety-inducing effects of CCK seems to be central with specific targets being the basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, and cortical regions.

==== Panicogenic ====
The CCK tetrapeptide fragment CCK-4 (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) reliably causes anxiety and panic attacks (panicogenic effect) when administered to humans and is commonly used in scientific research for this purpose of in order to test new anxiolytic drugs. Positron emission tomography visualization of regional cerebral blood flow in patients undergoing CCK-4 induced panic attacks show changes in the anterior cingulate gyrus, the claustrum-insular-amygdala region, and cerebellar vermis.

==== Hallucinogenic ====
Several studies have implicated CCK as a cause of visual hallucinations in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Mutations in CCK receptors in combination with mutated CCK genes potentiate this association. These studies also uncovered potential racial/ethnic differences in the distribution of mutated CCK genes.

== Interactions ==

CCK has been shown to interact with the cholecystokinin A receptor located mainly on pancreatic acinar cells and cholecystokinin B receptor mostly in the brain and stomach. CCKB receptor also binds gastrin, a gastrointestinal hormone involved in stimulating gastric acid release and growth of the gastric mucosa. CCK has also been shown to interact with calcineurin in the pancreas. Calcineurin will go on to activate the transcription factors NFAT 1–3, which will stimulate hypertrophy and growth of the pancreas. CCK can be stimulated by a diet high in protein, or by protease inhibitors. CCK has been shown to interact with orexin neurons, which control appetite and wakefulness (sleep). CCK can have indirect effects on sleep regulation.

CCK in the body cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but certain parts of the hypothalamus and brainstem are not protected by the barrier.

<text>Belt Creek () is a tributary, approximately 80 mi (129 km) long, of the Missouri River in western Montana in the United States.

It originates in the Lewis and Clark National Forest north of Big Baldy Mountain, in the Little Belt Mountains in western Judith Basin County. It flows northwest through mountainous canyons (Limestone Canyon) past Monarch, through Sluice Boxes State Park, and flows through Armington and Belt. It finally joins the Missouri approximately 15 mi (25 km) northwest of Great Falls of the Missouri and downstream of Morony Dam.

It is named for the Little Belt Mountains, which it flows through.

Willow, cottonwood, chokecherry, and wild roses grow in part of the canyon stretch and in a large band in the foothill zone. Brook, Brown, and Rainbow Trout have been introduced to the creek. Native fish include several minnows, mooneye, perch, sculpin, 4 types of suckers, and 2 types of trout.

<doc id="533582" wikidata="Q1408712" url="?curid=533582" title="Shoulder (road)">
<text>A shoulder (American English), hard shoulder (British English) or breakdown lane (Australian English) is an emergency stopping lane by the verge on the outer side of a road or motorway. Many wider freeways, or expressways elsewhere have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway—in the median, as well as at the outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are exceptions.

==Purpose==
Shoulders have multiple uses, including:
* Emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks and police cars may use the shoulder to bypass traffic congestion in some countries.
* In the event of an emergency or breakdown, a motorist can pull into the shoulder to get out of the flow of traffic and obtain a greater degree of safety.
* Active traffic management, used on busy multi-lane roads, may allow &#x27;hard shoulder running&#x27; by general traffic at reduced speeds during periods of high traffic volumes.
* In some places a &quot;bus bypass shoulder&quot; may be provided which allows bus services to pass stationary traffic.
* Paved shoulders provide additional space should a motorist need to take evasive action (such as avoiding a wrong-way driver) or need to recover control of their vehicle before a run-off-road collision occurs.
* In some rural areas without sidewalks, pedestrians and cyclists may be allowed to walk or ride on the shoulders.
* On curbed roadways, shoulders move the gutter away from the travel lanes which reduces the risk of aquaplaning, and reduces splash and spray of stormwater onto pedestrians using any adjacent sidewalk.
* Paved shoulders move water away from the roadway before it can infiltrate into the road&#x27;s subbase, increasing the life expectancy of the road surface.
* Shoulders help provide extra structural support of the roadway.
* In some countries, when semi-truck drivers need sleep and there are no available parking spaces at truck stops and rest areas, either because there are no such facilities nearby or because all semi-truck parking spaces are filled to capacity, drivers may pull over to the highway shoulder and sleep in their truck cabin.
* In some countries, parking in the shoulder is not prohibited by the law, and mushroom and berry pickers commonly use them on roads going through a forest.

==General characteristics==

The shoulder is usually slightly narrower than a full traffic lane. In some cases, particularly on older rural roadways, shoulders that initially existed were hardened with gravel rather than being paved with asphalt, tarmac or concrete. In Britain, motorway shoulders are now paved, but are still known as &quot;hard shoulders&quot;. Older, gravel shoulders have sometimes been termed soft shoulders by comparison. Because the paved surface ends at that point, they are less safe if they need to be used for emergency manoeuvres. Notably, the section of Ontario Highway 401 between Windsor and London had soft shoulders with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers, if drivers accidentally drifted off the paved section of the road and then overreacted after hitting the gravel. Modern practice is to build a continuous paved shoulder whenever possible.

The US Federal Highway Administration encourages the placement of a &quot;Safety Edge&quot;—a 30° compacted taper on the end of the pavement drop-off—to ensure that any driver running off the edge of the roadway is better able to maintain control while trying to steer back onto the roadway. The Safety Edge is effective on roads where the shoulder is narrow or non-existent.

To save money, the shoulder was often not paved to the same thickness as the through lanes, so if vehicles were to attempt to use it as a through lane regularly, it would rapidly deteriorate. In Britain, shoulder running can occur during roadworks, and full depth construction is now standard. In some metro areas, road authorities also allow shoulders to be used as lanes at peak periods. However, rural shoulders often collect various bits of road debris that can make driving there less safe.

Drivers will sometimes drift into the shoulder when being overtaken by passing vehicles, particularly on two-lane roads. However, it is extremely unsafe, and in most jurisdictions illegal, to abuse the shoulder by &#x27;undertaking&#x27; passing vehicles that are nearer the centre of the road.

On older roads, the shoulder may disappear for short periods, near exits or when going across or under bridges or tunnels where the cost savings were thought to outweigh the safety benefits of the shoulder. Some roads have a narrow shoulder for significant distances. This makes it difficult for large vehicles to pull into the hard shoulder altogether.

The Jingjintang Expressway in north-eastern China is an example of this phenomenon. Its shoulder is only wide, which is not wide enough for some automobiles—a standard lane in the U.S. and UK is . As a result, some motorists are unable to fully exit the mainline when they need to pull over, so they end up in a position that is halfway in the rightmost lane and only partly on the shoulder. The end result is often a traffic jam and occasionally a collision.

==Bus bypass shoulder==

In some jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, buses are allowed to drive on the shoulder to pass traffic jams, which is called a bus-only shoulder or bus-bypass shoulder (BBS); the term &quot;bus-only shoulder lane&quot; is incorrect from a technical and legal standpoint.
In Ontario, Highway 403 had its shoulders between Hurontario Street and Erin Mills Parkway widened in 2003 so they serve a dual purpose as bus lanes and accident lanes. In the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region of Minnesota, over of shoulder have been designated for use by buses. The Route 9 BBS in Central New Jersey which runs along two stretches of shoulders are dedicated for exclusive bus use during peak hours. The bus lanes, which run for approximately , are the first component of a planned BBS corridor. In the Chicago area, Pace buses are authorised to use the shoulder of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, Edens Expressway, and Stevenson Expressway to avoid delays from traffic congestion.

In the Seattle area, Community Transit and Sound Transit Express commuter buses are authorised to use the shoulders of Interstate 5 and Interstate 405 on small segments in Snohomish County as part of a pilot project that aims to reduce delayed bus trips.

There are also some bus-bypass shoulders in the United Kingdom, on the motorways of Northern Ireland heading towards Belfast and the M90 motorway in Scotland towards Edinburgh.

==Peak period use by all traffic==
In the United Kingdom, usage of the hard shoulder is known as &quot;hard shoulder running&quot;. A pilot project on an stretch of the M42 motorway, near Birmingham, began in September 2006. Active traffic management with special signage, new laybys and a controlled variable speed limit have been put in place to improve safety. This has proved very successful, with journey times decreasing by 26% northbound and 9% southbound. Drivers can also better predict their journey times as the variability decreased by 27%. The average accident rate dropped from 5.2 to 1.5 per month. It has also proved popular with motorists, 60% of whom want to see it expanded to other English motorways. This &#x27;smart motorway&#x27; system has been expanded to the M6, M1 and M25, as well as parts of the M60 and M62.

In the United States, on Interstate 93 between Exit 35 (formerly 41) and Exit 43 (formerly 46) and SR 3 between Exit 27 (formerly 12) and Exit 38 (formerly 16) in the Boston metro area, cars are allowed to use the shoulder as they would a normal lane during morning and evening rush hours. The same scheme is employed elsewhere, such as on Interstate 580 in California on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, and on Interstate 405 between SR 527 and I-5 in Bothell.

== Emergency use by all traffic ==

Florida has developed a plan for the use of inside shoulders by moving traffic during hurricane evacuations on portions of Interstate 4 (eastbound from Tampa to Celebration), Interstate 10 (westbound from Jacksonville to Tallahassee), Interstate 75 (northbound from Naples to I-10; both directions from Naples to Ft. Lauderdale), Interstate 95 (northbound from West Palm Beach to near Jacksonville), Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (northbound from Boynton Beach to Kissimmee and Winter Garden to I-75), and Florida State Road 528 (westbound through rural Orange County). Florida&#x27;s ESU plan prohibits trucks, busses, and trailers from driving on the shoulder and limits the speed limit to 50 mph on the shoulder, which is typically only wide compared to the standard width of highway travel lanes and contains rumble strips. The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labour- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.

The first implementation of the plan occurred on 8–9 September 2017 before the arrival of Hurricane Irma. Florida implemented ESU again in October 2024 prior to the arrival of Hurricane Milton, which underwent explosive intensification from a Category 1 into a Category 5 hurricane two days before its forecast landfall on the west central Gulf Coast of Florida as a major hurricane which prompted a large evacuation from the Tampa Bay and Sarasota-Bradenton areas. Texas has also considered emergency shoulder use for hurricane evacuations.

==Increased cyclist safety==
Although direct rear impacts only make up 3% of motorist-on-cyclist collisions, they are a more prominent collision type in arterial road type situations. When they occur in such circumstances, they are also associated with significantly increased risk of fatality. Data collated by the OECD indicates that rural locations account for 35% or more of cycling fatalities in Denmark, Finland, France, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, and Spain.

The use of appropriately designed segregated space on arterial or interurban routes appears to be associated with reductions in overall risk. In Ireland, the provision of hard shoulders on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents. It is reported that the Danes have also found that separate cycle tracks lead to a reduction in rural collisions.

In some countries, the use of shoulders is optional for cyclists, who may choose not to use it for reasons such as: it being too narrow, inviting dangerously close passes at high speed by motorists; it having a road surface unsuitable for cycling or putting the path of the cyclist in direct conflict with the paths of other road users, such as those turning across the shoulder. Generally, the usable width of the road begins where one can ride without increased danger of falls, jolts or blowouts. A road may have a gravel shoulder, its edge may be covered with sand or trash and the pavement may be broken.

==Characteristics in various countries==
===Australia===
In a similar manner to Canada, Italy and the United States, the shoulders located on the side of Australia&#x27;s highways are normally used as an emergency lane in the case of a breakdown or by emergency vehicles in the case of road congestion. However, no mandatory regulations exist to wear a high-visibility jacket when dismounting from the vehicle stopped in an emergency lane.

A recent study conducted by the National Coroners Information System (NCIS) in Australia has revealed 29 closed case fatalities (and at least a dozen case fatalities still under coronial investigation) that had been reported to Australian coroners where a person was &quot;struck in an emergency lane after their vehicle had stopped&quot; between July 2000 and November 2010.

===Canada and the United States===
The right-hand shoulder is separated by a solid white line, and the left-hand shoulder (if the road is one-way, such as part of a divided highway) is separated from the leftmost through lane by a solid yellow line. On many roads, the lines are supplemented by reflective raised pavement markers or rumble strips to provide additional visual and tactile feedback to drivers crossing the lines.

On freeways in foggy areas of California, there is an obvious break in the line of the shoulder before every exit. This is to help drivers find their exits in heavy fog (especially the dangerous tule fog).

===France===
In France, roadway shoulders are usually wide, or wide when the roadway carries more than 2,000 vehicles per day. The main difference from other European countries is that the white line is dashed, typically long with gaps long. The design is intended to provide a guide for drivers to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. Road signs can be found along motorways, to indicate the safe distance (1 line = too close, 2 lines = safe distance). At some points (tunnel, bridge, narrow road with no shoulder, tight curve) the edge line becomes solid.

===Ireland===

Full-width hard shoulders are provided on most new, upgraded (from the 1980s onwards), and major &quot;national roads&quot; in the Republic of Ireland, especially on wide two-lane and dual-carriageway roads (the shoulders on most 2+1 roads are narrow however). They are defined within the official document the &quot;Rules of the Road&quot; as a part of the road that should normally only be used by cyclists and pedestrians. Their provision of on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents involving pedal cyclists.

The hard shoulder is usually demarcated by road markings in the form of a single dashed yellow line with the addition of yellow cat&#x27;s eyes. On motorways, and at critical points on other routes (e.g. between junctions or interchanges, or beneath overpasses) a solid yellow line is used, denoting additional restrictions on usage of the hard shoulder. At junctions and on-ramps and off-ramps, the yellow line peels away into the turn, with a dashed white line (with green cats&#x27; eyes) denoting a lane division following the main route (i.e. in most cases the road remains the same width, and a turn lane takes the place of the hard shoulder).

In the 2000s, Bus Éireann coaches were allowed to use the hard shoulders on national roads into Dublin. However, dedicated bus lanes are now present on sections of some routes, such as the N7 &quot;Naas Road&quot;, and such use of actual hard shoulder is not universal.

===Italy===
The shoulders located on the sides of Italy&#x27;s highways are normally used as emergency lanes in case of breakdown or by emergency vehicles in case of queues. According to the regulation in force, it is mandatory to wear a high visibility jacket when dismounting from a vehicle stopped in an emergency lane.

Normally one is not allowed to drive on the shoulder, but in case of traffic blockage, use of the shoulder is allowed to reach an exit if it is within 500 metres.

===United Kingdom===

Full width hard shoulders are usually provided only on motorways and are usually wide, but there are exceptions. Some motorways do not have hard shoulders at all (for example the A57(M) and many smart motorways where the hard shoulder has been converted into a running lane, named all lane running smart motorways) and there are a small number of dual carriageway A-roads which do possess hard shoulders (for example, parts of the A1, A2 and A27). Hard shoulders are always marked with a reflecting solid white line which is wide and is provided with a rumble strip. A line of red cats&#x27; eyes is also used, and is placed to the side of the line.

On many modern non-motorway roads, hard strips are provided. These are usually wide, and are bounded by thinner solid white lines, and often without a rumble strip.

<text>Arrow Creek () is a tributary of the Missouri River in Montana in the United States. Approximately 45 miles (73 km) long, it rises in the Lewis and Clark National Forest near Highwood Baldy in the Highwood Mountains in southern Chouteau County. It flows south then east, then northeast and joins the Missouri in the White Cliffs Area on the border between Chouteau and Fergus counties.

<text>Hanumatodi, more popularly known as Todi (pronounced hanumatōdi and tōdi), is a rāgam (musical scale) in Carnatic music. It is the 8th &quot;melakarta&quot; rāgam (parent scale) in the 72 &quot;melakarta&quot; rāgam system. This is sung very often in concerts. It is a difficult rāgam to perform in owing to its complexity in &quot;prayoga&quot; (phrases of notes and intonation). It is called Janatodi in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music. Its Western equivalent is the Phrygian mode. Todi in Carnatic music is different from &quot;Todi (thaat)&quot; of Hindustani music (North Indian classical music). The equivalent of the Hindustani raga &quot;Todi&quot; in Carnatic music is &quot;Shubhapantuvarali&quot; (which is the 45th &quot;melakarta&quot;). The equivalent of Carnatic &quot;Todi&quot; in Hindustani is &quot;Bhairavi thaat&quot; in terms of notes, but the two sound very different due to differing uses of gamakas.

==Structure and Lakshana==
It is the 2nd rāgam in the 2nd &quot;chakra Netra&quot;. The mnemonic name is &quot;Netra-Sri&quot;. The mnemonic phrase is &quot;sa ra gi ma pa dha ni&quot;. Its &quot;ārohaṇa-avarohaṇa&quot; structure is as follows (see &quot;swaras&quot; in Carnatic music page for details on below notation and terms):
*ārohaṇa : 
*avarohaṇa : 

This scale uses the notes &quot;shuddha rishabham, sadharana gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, shuddha dhaivatham&quot; and &quot;kaisiki nishadham&quot;. It is a &quot;sampoorna&quot; rāgam - rāgam having all 7 &quot;swarams&quot;. It is the &quot;shuddha madhyamam&quot; equivalent of &quot;Bhavapriya&quot;, which is the 44th &quot;melakarta&quot; scale. A peculiarity of this raga is that it is sung in all lower notes. It is also classified as a &quot;rakti&quot; raga (a raga of high melodic content).

== &quot;Janya&quot; rāgams ==
&quot;Hanumatodi&quot; has many &quot;janya&quot; rāgams (derived scales) associated with it, of which &quot;Asaveri&quot;, &quot;Janatodi&quot;, &quot;Dhanyasi&quot;, &quot;Punnagavarali&quot; and &quot;Shuddha Seemanthini&quot; are popular. See List of &quot;janya&quot; rāgams for all of &quot;Todi&#x27;s janyas&quot;.

==Popular compositions==
Most composers have composed songs in &quot;Todi&quot;. Thyagaraja alone has composed about 32 compositions in this raga with each composition starting at every single note of the three octaves. Thāye Yashoda, composed by Oottukkadu Venkata Kavi, is a very well known composition, in the Tamil language. This popular &quot;kriti&quot; is sung frequently in concerts. A popular &quot;varnam&quot; in the &quot;Todi&quot; rāgam is &quot;Erā Nāpai&quot; by Patnam Subramania Iyer, one of the famous composers of Carnatic music.

<doc id="533618" wikidata="Q1640354" url="?curid=533618" title="Hydrostatic skeleton">
<text>A hydrostatic skeleton or hydroskeleton is a type of skeleton supported by hydrostatic fluid pressure or liquid, common among soft-bodied invertebrate animals colloquially referred to as &quot;worms&quot;. While more advanced organisms can be considered hydrostatic, they are sometimes referred to as hydrostatic for their possession of a hydrostatic &quot;organ&quot; instead of a hydrostatic &quot;skeleton&quot;, where the two may have the same capabilities but are not the same. As the prefix &quot;hydro-&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;, being hydrostatic means being fluid-filled.

As a skeletal structure, a hydroskeleton possesses the ability to affect shape and movement, and involves two mechanical units: the muscle layers and the body wall. The muscular layers are longitudinal and circular, and part of the fluid-filled coelom within. Contractions of the circular muscles lengthen the organism&#x27;s body, while contractions of the longitudinal muscles shorten the organism&#x27;s body. Fluid within the organism is evenly concentrated so the forces of the muscle are spread throughout the whole organism and shape changes can persist. These structural factors also persist in a hydrostatic organ.

A non-helical hydrostatic skeleton structure is the functional basis of the mammalian penis, which fills the corpus cavernosa with blood to maintain physical rigidity during coitus. Helically reinforced hydrostatic skeleton structure is typical for flexible structures as in soft-bodied animals.

== Structure ==

Hydrostatic skeletons are typically arranged in a cylinder. Hydrostatic skeletons can be controlled by several different muscle types. Length can be adjusted by longitudinal muscle fibers parallel to the longitudinal axis. The muscle fibers may be found in continuous sheets or isolated bundles, and the diameter can be manipulated by three different muscle types: circular, radial, and transverse. Circular musculature wraps around the circumference of the cylinder, radial musculature extends from the center of the cylinder towards the surface, and transverse musculature arrange in parallel and perpendicular sheets crossing the diameter of the cylinder.

Within the cylinder lies fluid, most often water. The fluid is resistant to changes in volume. Contraction of circular, radial or transverse muscles increases the pressure within the cylinder, and results in an increase in length. Contraction of longitudinal muscles can shorten the cylinder.

Change in shape is limited by connective tissue fibers. Connective fibers, often collagenous, are arranged in a helical shape within the wall of the hydrostatic skeleton. The helical shape formed by these fibers allows for elongation and shortening of the skeleton, while still remaining rigid to prevent torsion. As the shape of the cylinder changes, the pitch of the helix will change. The angle relative to the long axis will decrease during elongation and increase during shortening.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Organisms containing a hydrostatic skeleton have advantages and disadvantages. Their fluid shape allows them to move around easily while swimming and burrowing. They can fit through oddly shaped passages and hide themselves more effectively from predators. They are able to create a force when squeezing through rocks and create a “prying open” gesture. There is a lightweight, flexible component to them that allows this movement with very little muscle mass.

These organisms are also able to heal faster than organisms that contain hard skeletons. Healing in these organisms varies from creature to creature. However, if the cavity needs to be refilled, the “fluid” can easily be refilled if it is water or blood. If the fluid is some other type of liquid, it can take longer, but it is still faster than healing a bone. The common earthworm is also able to regrow damaged parts of its body.

These organisms have some relatively simple pathways for circulation and respiration. Also, these organisms have a cushion to allow protection for internal organs from shock. However, it does not protect internal organs from external damage very effectively.

Because the hydrostatic skeletons have limited ability for attachment of limbs, the organisms are relatively simple and do not have many abilities to grab or latch onto things. Organisms with complete hydrostatic skeletons need to be in an environment that allows them to re-fill themselves with their fluid that is necessary for survival. This is why hydrostatic skeletons are common in marine life. They have a large amount of access to the necessary elements for survival. Terrestrial organisms that have hydrostatic skeletons generally have a lack of strength because they are not in a fluid environment. If one were to expand its body too much, it would collapse under its own weight.

== Organisms ==
Hydrostatic skeletons are very common in invertebrates. A common example is the earthworm. Also, hydrostatic nature is common in marine life such as jellyfish and sea anemones. Earthworms have rings of muscles that are filled with fluid, making their entire body hydrostatic. A sea anemone has a hydrostatic head, with arms radiating out around the mouth. This structure is helpful in feeding and locomotion.

An example of a simple Deuterostome containing a hydrostatic skeleton would be Enteropneusta, with the common name of acorn worm. This organism is classified as a Hemichordate, and they are marine worms that use their hydrostatic skeleton to tunnel and anchor themselves into the ground. This can be used for locomotion, but also can aid in the defense of the organism against outside forces as the worm can try to &quot;hide&quot; itself within the ocean floor.

=== Vertebrates ===
The mammalian penis is a hydrostatic organ. The hydrostatic fluid, in this case blood, fills the penis during an erection. Unlike the hydrostatic skeletons of many invertebrates, which use the bending of the animal for locomotion, the penis must resist bending and shape changes during sexual intercourse. Instead of connective fibers arranged in a helical shape, the penis contains a layer called the corpus cavernosum. The corpus cavernosum contains connective fibers arranged both parallel and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. These fibers remain folded when the penis is flaccid, but unfold as the penis fills with blood during an erection, which allows the penis to resist bending. The penises of turtles are structured similarly, although they evolved separately.

Other vertebrates sometimes utilize a modified hydrostatic skeleton called a muscular hydrostat. Muscular hydrostats do not contain a fluid-filled cavity. These structures are constructed of muscle and connective fibers, densely packed into a 3-D structure. In many cases, the muscular hydrostat can be manipulated in all three dimensions. This allows for more precise movement compared to a typical hydrostatic skeleton. While in typical hydrostatic skeletons, movement is generated by applying force to a fluid-filled cavity, muscular hydrostats generate movement by muscle contractions. When one muscle contracts and decreases in area, other muscles within the structure must expand in response. Helical muscles may be present, which can create torsion, an ability that is restricted in hydrostatic skeletons. Muscular hydrostats are found in mammalian, reptilian, and amphibian tongues. Mammalian tongues have the structure of a central core of muscle fibers surrounded by bundles of longitudinal muscles and alternating parallel sheets of transverse muscle fibers. Elephant trunks and tapir proboscises also utilize a muscular hydrostat. These structures are composed of longitudinal fibers surrounded by radial and helical fibers.

<text>In the Hebrew Bible, a nazirite or a nazarite ( &quot;Nāzīr&quot;) is an Israelite (i.e. Jewish) man or woman who voluntarily took a vow which is described in . This vow required the nazirite to:

* Abstain from wine and strong drink as well as all other grape products, such as vinegar
* Refrain from cutting the hair on his head
* Not to become ritually impure by contact with corpses or graves, even those of family members.

After following these requirements for a designated time period (which would be specified in the individual&#x27;s vow), the nazirite would offer a specific animal sacrifice; along with it, the nazirite&#x27;s hair was to be shorn and burned.

The nazirite is described as being &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;holy unto God&quot;; yet at the same time, he or she must bring a sin offering. This has led to divergent approaches to the nazirite in the Talmud, and later authorities, with some viewing the nazirite as an ideal, and others viewing the nazirite as a sinner.

==Etymology==

&quot;Nazirite&quot; comes from the Hebrew word &quot;nazir&quot; meaning &quot;consecrated&quot; or &quot;separated&quot;, and may be ultimately derived from a root meaning &quot;vow&quot;, similar to the Hebrew &quot;neder&quot;. The word &quot;nazir&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to a prince, who fills a special position of secular power, and the cognate word &quot;nezer&quot; can refer to either the state of being a nazirite, or else to a physical crown.

== Hebrew Bible ==
===Laws===
Besides the basic laws to be followed during the nazirite period, Numbers 6 describes in detail the sacrifices to be offered at the conclusion of the period.

The nazirite would make three offerings: a lamb as a burnt offering, a ewe as a sin offering, and a ram as a peace offering; also three additional offerings (a basket of unleavened bread, a grain offering, and a drink offering) to accompany the peace offering. He would also shave his head in the outer courtyard of the Temple in Jerusalem, and place the hair on the same fire as the peace offering. The text is unclear whether this refers to the fire on the altar, or a cooking fire.

If the nazirite has accidentally become impure by touching a corpse during the nazirite period, he must offer a different offering, and restart the nazirite period from the beginning.

===Mentions===
In addition to the nazirite laws, there are a few other mentions of nazirites in the Hebrew Bible.

The prophet Amos condemned the Israelites for their failure to respect the nazirite vow:
:&quot;And I raised up some of your sons as prophets and some of your young men as nazirites... And you gave the nazirites to drink wine, and you commanded the prophets saying, &quot;Do not prophesy.&quot;&quot;

The Rechabites were a group mentioned in the Bible who avoided wine, similar to nazirites.

The Septuagint uses a number of terms to translate the 16 uses of &quot;nazir&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, such as &quot;he who vowed&quot; ( ) or &quot;he who was made holy&quot; ( ) etc. It is left untranslated and transliterated in Judges 13:5 as &quot;nazir&quot; ().

===Samson and Samuel===
Two prominent Biblical individuals who were nazirites, or similar to nazirites, were Samson (), and Samuel (). For both, their status was lifelong (unlike the nazirites described in Numbers 6). Both were born of previously barren mothers, and each entered into his vows through either his mother&#x27;s oath (as in the case of Samuel), or a divine command to his mother (in the case of Samson), rather than by their own volition. These vows required Samson and Samuel to live devout lives, yet in return they received extraordinary gifts: Samson possessed strength and ability in physical battle against the Philistines, while Samuel became a prophet.

While Samson was explicitly commanded to be a nazirite (), the word &quot;nazirite&quot; was not used regarding Samuel, rather he was &quot;given to the Lord&quot; and forbidden to cut his hair ().

Some commentators later noted that Samson appears to break his nazirite vow several times throughout the text; his killing of both humans and animals would frequently threaten, if not outright violate, his vow of ritual purity, and describes Samson holding a feast – an event which traditionally entailed the consumption of wine (though the text never states that Samson drank any wine himself). This conflict of interpretation has spawned numerous explanations: rabbinic sources claimed Samson had a unique nazirite status (called Nazir Shimshon) which permitted him to touch dead bodies, since the angel who imposed the status omitted this restriction. David Kimhi conjectures that even without this special status, Samson would be allowed to touch dead bodies while doing God&#x27;s work defending Israel. Another argument analyzes the semantics of the vow itself; Numbers 6:6 forbids nazirites from coming near a &quot;nephesh-mot&quot; (a dead body), and though there are cases in the Pentateuch where &quot;nephesh&quot; is used to refer to animals (see Genesis 1:21, 24; 9:12; Lev. 11:46; etc.), the term in Numbers 6:6 is usually taken to imply the human dead, which seems to be its most focused meaning according to Numbers 6:7. In any event, the supernatural strength that Samson was given was evidently not taken away at the time of Judges 14, indicating that his nazirite vow was not considered broken. Goswell suggests that &quot;we cannot understand the career and failings of Samson without attention to his Nazirite status.&quot;

== In Rabbinic literature ==
=== Laws ===
Halakha (Jewish law) has a rich tradition on the laws of the nazirite. In addition to the Biblical text of , the laws are explained in detail in the Mishna and Talmud, tractate &quot;Nazir&quot;. These laws were later codified by Maimonides in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;.

==== Vows ====
An Israelite (not a gentile) becomes a Nazirite through an intentional verbal declaration. This declaration can be in any language, and can be something as simple as saying &quot;me too&quot; as a Nazirite passes by. In general there are two types of Nazirites, those who take a vow for a set time, and permanent Nazirites. A person can specify how long he intends to be a Nazirite, but if no time period or a time period of less than 30 days is specified, the vow is considered to last for 30 days. A person who says &quot;I am a Nazirite forever&quot; or &quot;I am a Nazirite for all my life&quot; is a permanent Nazirite and slightly different laws apply. However, if a person says that he is a Nazirite for a thousand years, he is a regular Nazirite. The permanent Nazirite has no source in the Bible but is known through tradition.

All the laws of vows in general apply also to the nazirite vow. As with other vows, a father has the ability to annul the vow of his young daughter, and a husband has the ability to annul a vow by his wife, when he first hears about it (). A father, but not a mother, can declare his son, but not his daughter, a Nazirite, however the child or any close family member has a right to refuse this status. Likewise, all of the laws related to intent and conditional vows apply also to Nazirite vows.

====Sacrifices====
At the end of their vow, the Nazirite brings three sacrificial offerings to the Temple in Jerusalem. The first is a ewe for a &quot;chatat&quot; (sin offering), the second is a lamb for an &quot;olah&quot; (elevation offering), and finally a ram as a &quot;shelamim&quot; (peace offering) along with a basket of matzah and grain and drink offerings. 

After bringing the sacrificial offerings, the Nazirite shaves their head in the outer courtyard of the Temple, and the hair is burned on &quot;the fire which is under the peace offering&quot;. The rabbis (along with some but not all academic scholars) view this as simply the appropriate disposal of a sanctified object, rather than being the hair itself being a sacrifice.

Part of the Nazirite&#x27;s offering is given to the Kohen; this gift is one of the twenty-four kohanic gifts.

A person can become a Nazirite whether or not the Temple in Jerusalem is standing. However, no temple means that there is currently no way to make the offerings that end the Nazirite vow, so anyone taking the vow would become a &quot;de facto&quot; permanent Nazirite.

==== Abstinence from grape products ====
A Nazirite must abstain from all beverages derived from grapes, even if they are not alcoholic. According to traditional rabbinic interpretation, the Nazirite may drink alcoholic beverages not derived from grapes. According to less traditional rabbinic interpretation, a Nazirite is forbidden to consume any alcohol, and vinegar from such alcohol, regardless of its source. The law regarding combining wine or grapes with other food is similar to kashrut, which applies to all Jews. An early rabbinic proverb warned the Nazirite: &quot;Get yourself far around [it]! Don&#x27;t even come near to a vineyard!&quot;

==== Uncut hair ====
A Nazirite must refrain from cutting the hair of his head. He can groom his hair with his fingers or scratch his head and need not be concerned if some hair falls out, however, he cannot use a comb since it very likely to pull out some hair. A Nazirite is not allowed to use a chemical depilatory to remove hair. However, a Nazirite who recovers from the skin disease of tzaraath is obligated to cut his hair, and a permanent Nazirite may cut his hair once a year. Nazirites who shave their hair are obligated to redo the last 30 days of the Nazirite period.

==== Avoidance of corpses and graves ====
A Nazirite must avoid corpses and graves, even those of family members, and any building that contains one. (In this respect, the nazirite is similar to the high priest.) A permanent Nazirite becomes ritually impure through proximity to a corpse. Nonetheless, a Nazirite who finds an unburied corpse is obligated to bury it, although he will become defiled in the process.

If a Nazirite touches a corpse or carries a funeral bier, or goes into a building that contains a corpse, their vow is ended as unfulfilled. In this case, after he has waited seven days for his purification, the Nazirite should shave their head and to bring sacrificial offerings. After that, he is permitted to put himself under another Nazirite vow with a new time limit.

If the Nazirite simply enters an area where a grave or graveyard had been ploughed (in which case there is only a chance that he touched human bones), or if he went into a foreign land that was declared unclean by the chazal (sages) and had touched its earth, or if he stands beneath the branches of a tree or a rock that shades the ground () near a graveyard, he still contracts a level of uncleanness. However this is less than the impurity of touching corpse, and although he must be sprinkled with water containing the ashes of a red heifer on the third and seventh days, he is not required to shave his head or bring sacrificial offerings, and his Nazirite vow is not invalidated, though he adds seven days to the time he spends as a Nazirite to make up for the days of impurity.

=== Desirability ===

Noting that the nazirite must offer a sin-offering at the end of their vow (), Rabbi Eleazar ha-Kappar argued that nazirites are effectively sinners for unnecessarily distressing themselves, while Rabbi Elazar argued the opposite, that nazirites are &quot;holy&quot; () and thus to become one is desirable.

Among medieval authorities, Maimonides followed the view of Rabbi Eliezer Hakappar, calling a nazirite a sinner, and explaining that a person should always be moderate in his actions and not be to any extreme. Nevertheless, he does point out that a nazirite can be evil or righteous depending on the circumstances. In contrast, Nachmanides sided with Rabbi Eleazer. He explains that ideally, the person should be a nazirite his whole life. Therefore, ceasing to be nazirite requires a sin offering. Opinions recorded in the Tosafot compromise between these views and explain that a nazirite is both good and bad.

Reviewing Halakhic and Aggadic literature, Jacob Neusner writes that Jewish sages generally viewed the vow of the nazirite to be shrouded in &quot;arrogance&quot; and &quot;weakness&quot;.

According to Rabbi Meir, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a grape-vine, for &quot;nothing brings wailing upon a person like wine&quot;.

=== Stories ===
According to the Mishnah, Queen Helena of Adiabene (c. 48 CE) once placed herself under a Nazirite vow for seven years, on condition that her son returned home from war safely. When her son returned home safely, she began to perform her Nazirite vow for seven years, after which she brought the required animal offerings to the Jerusalem. Upon arriving there, she was told by the School of Hillel that she must observe her vow anew, and she therefore lived as a Nazirite for seven more years. Towards the end of those seven years, she contracted corpse uncleanness which rendered her vow as null and void, and, therefore, was required to repeat her Nazirite vow once again for a period of another seven years. Altogether, she continued her Nazirite vow for a period of 21 years.

According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Simeon the Just (a High Priest) opposed the nazirite vow and ate of the sacrifice offered by a nazirite on only a single occasion. Once a youth with flowing hair came to him and wished to have his head shorn. When asked his motive, the youth replied that he had seen his own face reflected in the spring and it had pleased him so that he feared lest his beauty might become an idol to him. He, therefore, wished to offer up his hair to God, and Simeon then partook of the sin offering which he brought.

The Jerusalem Talmud tells the story of 300 nazirites who came to offer sacrifices at the conclusion of their vow, but could not afford the animals for the sacrifices. Shimon ben Shetach, who was head of the Sanhedrin, was able to annul the vows of 150 of them (retroactively cancelling the nazirite period and making their sacrifices unnecessary), but was unable to find a justification to annul the vows of the other 150. He then went to the king (Alexander Jannaeus), and offered to split the costs of sacrifices for the 300 nazirites. The king provided money for the sacrifices of the 150; Shimon provided no money as the vows of his 150 were already nullified. This angered the king, who felt tricked: Shimon was forced to flee, but eventually reconciled with the king by explaining how they had contributed equally, &quot;you with your money and I with my learning&quot;.

Gamaliel records in the Mishna how the father of Rabbi Chenena made a lifetime nazirite vow before him.

== In the New Testament ==

=== In the Gospels ===

The practice of a nazirite vow is part of the ambiguity of the Greek term &quot;Nazarene&quot; that appears in the New Testament; the sacrifice of a lamb and the offering of bread does suggest a relationship with Christian symbolism (then again, these are the two most frequent offerings prescribed in Leviticus, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn). While a saying in and attributed to Jesus makes it doubtful that he, reported to be &quot;a winebibber&quot;, was a nazirite during his ministry, the verse ends with the curious statement, &quot;But wisdom is justified of all her children&quot;. The advocation of the ritual consumption of wine as part of the Passover in Mark 14:22–25 indicated he kept this aspect of the nazirite vow when Jesus said, &quot;Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.&quot; The ritual with which Jesus commenced his ministry (recorded via Greek as &quot;baptism&quot;) and his vow in and at the end of his ministry, do respectively reflect the final and initial steps (purification by immersion in water and abstaining from wine) inherent in a nazirite vow. These passages may indicate that Jesus intended to identify himself as a nazirite (&quot;not drinking the fruit of vine&quot;) before his crucifixion.

Luke the Evangelist clearly was aware that wine was forbidden in this practice, for the angel () that announces the birth of John the Baptist foretells that &quot;he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother&#x27;s womb&quot;, in other words, a nazirite from birth, the implication being that John had taken a lifelong nazirite vow.

=== In the Acts of the Apostles ===
Acts of the Apostles is also attributed to Luke (see Luke-Acts) and in it is reported that the apostle Paul cut off his hair &quot;because of a vow he had taken&quot;. From we learn that the early Jewish Christians occasionally took the temporary nazirite vow, and it is probable that the vow of St. Paul mentioned in Acts 18:18, was of a similar nature, although the shaving of his head in Cenchrea, outside of Palestine, was not in conformity with the rules laid down in the sixth chapter of Numbers, nor with the interpretation of them by the rabbinical schools of that era. If we are to believe the legend of Hegesippus quoted by Eusebius, James, brother of Jesus, Bishop of Jerusalem, was a nazirite, and performed with rigorous exactness all the practices enjoined by that rule of life. In Paul was advised to counter the claims made by some Judaizers (that he encouraged a revolt against the Mosaic Law). He showed the &quot;believers there&quot; (believers in Jesus, i.e. the Jewish Christians) in Jerusalem otherwise by purifying himself and accompanying four men to the temple who had taken naziritic vows (so as to refute the naysayers).

This stratagem only delayed the inevitable mob assault on him. This event brought about the accusation in that Paul was the &quot;ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes&quot;, and thus provides further verification that the term &quot;Nazarene&quot; was a mistranslation of the term &quot;nazirite&quot;. In any case, the relationship of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism is still disputed.

Luke does not here mention the apostle James the Just as taking nazirite vows, although later Christian historians (e.g. Epiphanius &quot;Panarion&quot; 29.4) believed he had, and the vow of a nazirite would explain the asceticism Eusebius of Caesarea ascribed to James, a claim that gave James the title &quot;James the Just&quot;.

== Nazirites in history ==
Besides the aforementioned mentions of nazirites in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and classic rabbinic texts, the following ancient texts describe cases of naziriteship:

=== Deuterocanonical texts ===
1 Maccabees, dated to about 166 BCE, mentions men who had ended their nazirite vows.

=== Josephus ===
Josephus mentions a number of people who had taken the vow, such as his tutor Banus. Josephus briefly recounts an episode where, in the 12th year of the reign of Nero, during the outbreak of the First Jewish-Roman War, Bernice (the sister of King Agrippa II) had put herself under a Nazirite vow and had come to Jerusalem thirty days before she was to offer her sacrifices, during which time she was to abstain from wine, and after which to shave the hair of her head. Josephus adds that those who put themselves under the Nazirite vow often did so when they &quot;had been either afflicted with a distemper, or with any other distresses.&quot;

=== Early Syriac Christianity ===
Several Syriac Christians beginning in the 4th century appropriated the vow in ascetical practice.

Apharat writes in the 4th century: &quot;The sons of Seth were virtuous in their virginity, but when they became mixed up with the daughters of Cain, they were blotted out with the water of the flood. Samson was honorable in his Naziriteship and in his virginity, but he corrupted his Naziriteship with his licentiousness.&quot;

John Scully records Ephrem suggesting that &quot;the vines of Paradise rush out to meet only those ascetics who lead a life of virginity and abstain from wine&quot; in the 4th century.

John the Solitary refers to John the Baptist for a model of fasting in the 5th century.

Dadisho&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on Abba Isaiah&quot; lists several physical activities in relation to the term &quot;Nazirite&quot;.

The anonymous author of the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot; writes: And [the Priest] shall be a Nazirite all the days of his life. He shall not take a wife, he shall not have a house to dwell in, and he shall not offer the blood of animals or fowl. Rather, he will offer bread and wine to God.

== In modern religion ==

=== Modern Judaism===
Rabbi David Cohen, a leading disciple of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, was a nazirite for much of his life.

=== Rastafari ===
The tradition of the nazirite vow has had a significant influence on the Rastafari religion, and elements of the vow have been adopted as part of this religion. In describing the obligations of their religion, Rastafari make reference to the nazirite vow taken by Samson. Part of this vow, as adopted by the Rastafari, is to avoid the cutting of one&#x27;s hair. This is inspired by the text of Leviticus 21:5 &quot;They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh.&quot; The visible sign of this vow is the Rastafarian&#x27;s dreadlocks. Some Rastafari have concluded that Samson had dreadlocks, as suggested by the description stating that he had seven locks upon his head (Judges 16:13).

Additionally, the Rastafari are taught to abstain from alcohol in accordance with the nazirite vow. They have also adopted dietary laws derived from Leviticus, which accounts for some similarity to the prohibitions of the Jewish dietary law of Kashrut.

=== Protestant perspectives ===
In 1979, Witness Lee of the Local Church movement published the &quot;Principle of the Nazarite&quot;, a short pamphlet outlining a metaphorical interpretation of the vow for uptake amongst Christians.

Lou Engle, a Charismatic evangelical American leader, has written &quot;Nazarite DNA&quot;, which outlines a metaphorical interpretation of the vow.

<text>The Odia script (, also ) is a Brahmic script used to write the Odia language. To a lesser extent, it is also used to write Sanskrit and other regional languages. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. The script has developed over more than 1000 years from a variant of Siddhaṃ script which was used in Eastern India, where the characteristic top line transformed into a distinct round umbrella shape due to the influence of palm leaf manuscripts and also being influenced by the neighbouring scripts from the Western and Southern regions.

Odia is a syllabic alphabet or an abugida wherein all consonants have an inherent vowel embedded within. Diacritics (which can appear above, below, before, or after the consonant they belong to) are used to change the form of the inherent vowel. When vowels appear at the beginning of a syllable, they are written as independent letters. Also, when certain consonants occur together, special conjunct symbols combine the essential parts of each consonant symbol.

An important feature of the Odia language seen in the script is the retention of inherent vowel in consonants, also known as schwa, at both medial and final positions. This absence of schwa deletion, which is also seen in Sanskrit, marks it from the rest of modern Indo-Aryan languages and their equivalent usage in related Brahmic scripts. The absence of the inherent vowel in the consonant is marked by a virama or halanta sign below the consonant.

== History ==
In Eastern India, a derivative of Siddhaṃ script yielded a group of scripts that eventually became Bengali-Assamese scripts, Tirhuta script and the Odia script, with the latter turning the hook into a characteristic umbrella. The earliest known example of Odia language, in the Kalinga script, dates from 1051.

The curved appearance of the Odia script is a result of the practice of writing on palm leaves, which have a tendency to tear with the use of too many straight lines.

As with all the Brahmic scripts in the region, the Odia script developed through four stages which can be seen from the stone inscriptions, copper-plates and the manuscripts. The periods of development are in the following order,

# Proto-Odia: ca 7th- 9th CE
# Medieval Odia: ca 10th- 12th CE
# Transitional Odia: ca 12th- 14th CE
# Modern (current) Odia: ca 14th- 16th CE

The archaic and medieval forms of Odia are more influenced by the calligraphy of the scripts of neighbouring regions, such as,

# In Northern Odisha, where the letters are written in Odia, mixed in with Siddham-derived Gaudi style (that is the right vertical part of the letter is slightly bent inwards).
# In southern Odisha, where it is mixed with Telugu-Kannada round, cursive form.
# In Western Odisha, where it is mixed with Nagari and Siddham (squarish shape in upper-part).

With regards to the epigraphical sources, the antiquities which display the various historical forms of writing in Odia script include rock-edicts, temple inscriptions, stone-slabs, pillar inscriptions, sculptures, copper-plates, coins and palm-leaf manuscripts, illustrated manuscripts, ivory plates and allied materials. Numerous instances of the items depicting all the respective stages of the development of the Odia script during the illustrious dynasties of Eastern Ganga, Somavanshi, Bhanja, Bhauma-kara, Sailodbhava dynasties.

Some of them belonging to different centuries are as follows-

# One of the earliest specimens of the Odia script is that of the Urjam inscription dating from the 11th CE (1051 CE). The language used in the inscriptions is a dialect spoken on the border regions of Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. The same applies to a bilingual and biscriptual stone inscription (Odia and Tamil) from the reign of Narasimhadeva (13th CE), found at Bhubaneswar. Odia language in old Odia script is seen on the right side while Tamil in Grantha on the left side.
# The Gumsur copper-plate grant of Netribhanjadeva (11th CE) depicts the medieval phase of this script in square and round variety.
# The stone inscription of the Pottesvara temple, Ganjam district (137 CE), is a notable example of Odia script influenced by Telugu-Kannada variety.
# The Antirigam plate of Yashabhanjadeva (12th CE) depicts Odia calligraphy influenced by northern Nagari. The differences in letters script seems to indicate of the script being in a transitional phase.
# Khilor inscription of Anantavarman (12th CE) shows the Gaudi or Proto-Oriya script round shape on the upper part, almost developed like the modern ones.
# The early epigraphical records of the Puri inscriptions of Anangabhima III (1211-1238 CE), which is considered to be as one of the earliest Odia inscriptions showing the Gaudi characters, not only shows the stage of the proto, early and medieval phase if the evolution of the Odia script, but also the numericals in early proto-Oriya type while others to be that of the Telugu-Kannada type. The earlier inscription of Chodagangadeva (1114-1115 CE) shows the Late Siddhaṃ variety where the pristhamatra style of vowel diacritics is quite prominent.
# In the records of Kenduapatna copper-plates in Sanskrit of the Eastern Ganga King Narasimhadeva II (1278-1305 CE), a transitional variety is seen depicting the development of Odia from Gaudi (showing squarish with round headlines in a ductus that is quite commonly seen on copper-plates and stone inscriptions).
# The copper-plate land-grant record of the Gajapati King Purushottamadeva (15th CE), inscribed on a copper axe-head, shows the distinct early version of the modern Odia script which are also seen on the palm-leaves manuscripts belonging to the 15th CE.

With regards to the manuscript sources, the full-fledged script of Odia acquires its classical umbrella hook shape through the development, modification as well as simplification between the 14th and 15th CE, when the palm-leaf manuscript culture becomes dominant in this region. Since the palm-leaves are perishable in nature, no manuscripts are currently available pre-15th CE. Hence, recent works are also important as they show the rare and ancient text as well as artistic illustrations. One of the earliest dated palm-leaf manuscripts is that of Abhinava Gita-Govinda kept in Odisha State Museum. The date of completion of the manuscript is estimated to be that of 1494 CE. Among other manuscripts present at the museum, includes historical works like manuscripts of Jayadeva&#x27;s Gita-Govinda (16th CE) to the relatively recent works of 18th,19th and 20th century.

Overwhelmingly, the Odia script was used to write the Odia language. However, it has been used as a regional writing-system for Sanskrit. Furthermore, Grierson in his famed &quot;Linguistic Survey of India&quot; mentioned that the Odia script is sometimes used for Chhattisgarhi, an Eastern Hindi language, in the eastern border regions of Chhattisgarh. However it appears to have been replaced with the Devanagari script.

== Alphabet ==
=== Consonants ===
Two categories of consonant letters are defined in Odia: the structured consonants () and the unstructured consonants ().

The structured consonants are classified according to their place of articulation, that is, where the tongue touches the palate. 



In the first standardised Odia alphabet book, &quot;Barnabodha&quot; was compiled by Madhusudan Rao in 1895, the phonemes &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;va&quot; and &quot;wa&quot; were represented by the same letter ବ, with the sounds &quot;va&quot; and &quot;wa&quot;. This was because the phonemes &quot;ba&quot; and &quot;va&quot; had merged in the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages. The phoneme &quot;wa&quot; could be written through the consonant ligature symbol ୍ୱ, which it shared with &quot;ba&quot;. Gopala Chandra Praharaj, who compiled and published the first comprehensive Odia dictionary, &quot;Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha&quot; (1931–40), introduced a new letter ୱ to the script to represent the sound &quot;wa&quot;. An alternate letter was created for &quot;wa&quot;, ଵ, but it has not gained wide acceptance.

==== Ligatures ====
Clusters of two or more consonants form a ligature. Odia has two types of consonant ligatures, the &quot;northern&quot; and &quot;southern&quot; types. The &quot;northern&quot; type is formed by fusion of two or more consonants as in northern scripts like Devanāgarī; in some instances, the components of a northern-type ligature be easily identified, but sometimes completely new glyphs are formed. With the &quot;southern&quot; type, the second component is reduced in size and put under the first as in the southern scripts used for  and Telugu.

There are some ambiguities. The subjoined form of ଛ &quot;cha&quot; is also used for subjoined ଥ &quot;tha&quot;:
* for ଛ &quot;cha&quot;: ଚ୍ଛ &quot;ccha&quot;, ଞ୍ଛ &quot;ñcha&quot;, ଶ୍ଛ &quot;ścha&quot;
* for ଥ &quot;tha&quot;: ନ୍ଥ &quot;ntha&quot;, ସ୍ଥ &quot;stha&quot;
The sign for the nasal ଂ &quot;ṃ&quot; looks similar to the right side of the glyph used for ଫ &quot;pha&quot; and ଙ &quot;ṅa&quot;:
* ଫ &quot;pha&quot; (versus ପଂ &quot;paṃ&quot;)
* ଙ &quot;ṅa&quot; (versus ଡଂ &quot;ḍaṃ&quot; or ଉଂ &quot;uṃ&quot;)
* ମ୍ଫ &quot;mpha&quot; (versus ମ୍ପଂ &quot;mpaṃ&quot;)
===Vowels===
Odia is an alphasyllabic alphabet or an abugida wherein all consonants have an inherent vowel embedded within. Diacritics (which can appear above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to) are used to change the form of the inherent vowel. When vowels appear at the beginning of a syllable, they are written as independent letters. Also, when certain consonants occur together, special conjunct symbols are used to combine the essential parts of each consonant symbol. 

There is no significant difference in the pronunciation of long and short vowels.

A different form of ଇ is used with the consonants ଖ (kha), ଥ (tha), ଧ (dha). This diacritic is a remnant from the Odia cursive style variant Karani script.


There is a set of four vocalics, each with an independent form and vowel diacritic, but only one, ଋ is used in modern Odia. ୠ, ଌ, ୡ and their diacritics are only used for Sanskrit transcription, so they are not always included in the Odia alphabet.

===Additional letters and diacritics ===
The &quot;anusvara&quot; and &quot;candrabindu&quot; diacritics are used to indicate nasalisation. A &quot;visarga&quot; adds a post-vocalic voiceless glottal fricative ḥ to the end of a syllable.

==Other symbols ==


== Karani script or Odia calligraphic style ==

Karani script (କରଣୀ ଅକ୍ଷର) (also Chata script ଛଟା ଅକ୍ଷର) was a cursive/calligraphic style variant of the Odia script developed by the Karana (କରଣ) community. It was used in the pre-Independence Orissa (Odisha) region in South Asia and was primarily used by the Karana community who were working for administrative purposes, documentation and keeping records in the royal courts of the Odia princely states (Orissa Tributary States). The name Karani is derived from the metal stylus, Karani that was used for writing on palm leaf.

== Numerals ==



== Comparison of Odia script with ancestral script ==

Odia letters are mostly round shaped whereas sister scripts from Siddhaṃ have horizontal lines. So in most cases the reader of Odia will find the related distinctive parts of the letter only below the curved hoop.

== Sample text ==
===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
The following is a sample text in Odia of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

====Odia in the Odia script====
====Odia in ISO 15919====
====Odia in the IPA====
====Gloss====
All human beings from birth are free and dignity and rights are equal. Their reason and intelligence endowed with and they towards one another in a brotherhood spirit behaviour to do should.

====Translation====
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

== Unicode ==
Odia script was added to the Unicode Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

<doc id="533637" wikidata="Q1025419" url="?curid=533637" title="Caesar Augustus Rodney">
<text>Caesar Augustus Rodney (January 4, 1772 – June 10, 1824) was an American lawyer and politician from Wilmington, in New Castle County, Delaware. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly, as well as a U.S. Representative from Delaware, U.S. Senator from Delaware, U.S. Attorney General, and U.S. Minister to Argentina.

==Early life and family==

Rodney was born in Dover in the Delaware Colony, son of Thomas Rodney and Elizabeth Fisher. He was the nephew of Caesar Rodney, the signer of the Declaration of Independence who is depicted on the Delaware state quarter. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1789, he studied law under Joseph B. McKean in Philadelphia and was admitted to the bar in 1793. He practiced law in Wilmington and New Castle, Delaware, for the next three years. Rodney married Susan Hunn, the daughter of Captain John Hunn, and their home was &quot;Cool Springs&quot;, located in Wilmington.

==Professional and political career==
Rodney served six terms as State Representative, from the 1797 session through the 1802 session. There he became one of the leaders of the Jeffersonian party, now known as the Democratic-Republican Party. Encouraged by Jefferson to compete for the U.S. House against the staunch Federalist James A. Bayard, Rodney ran and won a lively campaign by fifteen votes. While in the U.S. House, he was a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and established a national reputation as one of the impeachment managers appointed in January 1804 to prepare and prosecute the articles of impeachment in the impeachment proceedings against John Pickering, judge of the United States District Court for New Hampshire. Pickering was charged with conduct unbecoming a judge, and his acquittal was viewed as strengthening the independence of the judiciary. In December of the same year, Rodney served as an impeachment manager in another such case against Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

After serving one term in the U.S. House from March 4, 1803, until March 3, 1805, he was defeated for reelection in 1804 by Bayard, by nearly as close a vote. The two men, always vigorous political opponents, remained good friends throughout their tumultuous political careers.

While Rodney spent most of his legal career in public service, he took on at least one notable case as a private advocate during the year before his appointment as Attorney General. In 1806, he made an appearance before the Mayor&#x27;s Court of Philadelphia to defend the Philadelphia Cordwainers against a common law charge of conspiracy. The conspiracy charge was instituted by retail shoe merchants, based on attempts by the journeyman shoe and boot makers, to organize for the purpose of setting their wages and hours. Rodney was unsuccessful in attaining an acquittal for the workers.

==Attorney general==

On January 20, 1807, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson named Rodney his U.S. Attorney General. He served in that office for the remainder of Jefferson&#x27;s term and for nearly three years in President James Madison&#x27;s first term. As Attorney General, Rodney participated as a member of the prosecution during the second treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr. Rodney resigned December 5, 1811, unhappy about being passed over for a U.S. Supreme Court appointment. During the War of 1812, he was captain of a rifle corps which became the Delaware 1st Artillery. They served at Fort Union in Wilmington, on the Canadian frontier, and assisted in the defense of Baltimore in 1814.

==Later political activity==
Rodney returned to politics, serving in the Delaware State Senate for three sessions from 1815 through 1817. In 1820 he was again elected to the U.S. House, serving from March 4, 1821, until January 24, 1822, when he resigned upon being elected to the U.S. Senate. He served there only a year as well, resigning January 29, 1823, to accept a diplomatic appointment. During that brief year Rodney was Delaware&#x27;s only Democratic-Republican U.S. Senator ever.

Along with John Graham and Theodorick Bland, Rodney was selected by President James Monroe in 1817 for a special diplomatic mission to South America, the South American Commission of 1817–1818. Rodney was appointed to lead the commission to investigate whether the newly formed South American republics should be recognized. He strongly advocated such recognition and, with Graham, published his findings in 1819 as &quot;Reports on the Present State of the United Provinces of South America.&quot; This report is thought to have contributed much to the thinking behind the policy that eventually became expressed as the Monroe Doctrine. It also resulted in Rodney&#x27;s 1823 appointment as United States Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, now known as Argentina. He remained at this posting until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Rodney died June 10, 1824, in Buenos Aires, and was buried there in the Victoria district British Cemetery. His remains were moved to a crypt at St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in Buenos Aires. The crypt is at the peristyle of the entrance of the cathedral.
==Almanac==
Elections were held the first Tuesday of October. Members of the General Assembly took office on the first Tuesday of January. State Representatives were elected for one year. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and have a two-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who also took office March 4, but for a six-year term. In this case the General Assembly failed to fill the position for nearly a year.

<doc id="533642" wikidata="Q3814707" url="?curid=533642" title="1994 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 18 and 25 February 1994. This election, the second since Fiji had become a republic following two military coups in 1987, was brought about by splits within the ruling Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) and by the withdrawal of the support of the Fiji Labour Party, which claimed that Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka had reneged on a deal to review Fiji&#x27;s electoral system, which was heavily weighted in favour of ethnic Fijians, despite their being nearly equal in number to Indo-Fijians.

The elections produced little change among the 38 seats in the House of Representatives that were reserved for ethnic Fijians and Rotuman Islanders. The SVT won 33 seats, and the Fijian Association Party of former Finance Minister Josefata Kamikamica won five. The Fijian Nationalist Party of Sakeasi Butadroka, which advocated the forced repatriation of all Fijians of Indian descent, lost the three seats that it had won in the previous election. The five &quot;general electorates,&quot; reserved for Fiji&#x27;s European, Chinese, and other minorities, showed similarly little change, with the General Voters Party winning four seats and the All Nationals Congress, one. There was a very significant change in the composition of the 27 Indo-Fijian seats, however. The Fiji Labour Party lost 6 of its 13 seats, with the National Federation Party winning the remaining 20. The NFP leader, Jai Ram Reddy, enjoyed a personal rapport with Rabuka; although they did not enter into a formal coalition, their negotiations led to a substantial overhaul of the Fijian Constitution which paved the way for the historic election of 1999, which brought Fiji&#x27;s first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, to power.

Following the 1994 election, Rabuka formed a coalition with the General Voters Party and remained Prime Minister.

<text>Mimivirus is a genus of giant viruses, in the family &quot;Mimiviridae&quot;. It is believed that Amoeba serve as their natural hosts. It also refers to a group of phylogenetically related large viruses.

In colloquial speech, APMV is more commonly referred to as just &quot;mimivirus&quot;. Mimivirus, short for &quot;mimicking microbe&quot;, is so called to reflect its large size and apparent Gram-staining properties.

Mimivirus has a large and complex genome compared with most other viruses. Until 2013, when a larger virus &quot;Pandoravirus&quot; was described, it had the largest capsid diameter of all known viruses.

==History==
APMV was discovered accidentally in 1992 within the amoeba &quot;Acanthamoeba polyphaga&quot;, after which it is named, during research into legionellosis by researchers from Marseille and Leeds. The virus was observed in a Gram stain and mistakenly thought to be a Gram-positive bacterium. As a consequence it was named Bradfordcoccus, after Bradford, England, where the amoeba had originated. In 2003, researchers at the Université de la Méditerranée in Marseille, France, published a paper in &quot;Science&quot; identifying the micro-organism as a virus. It was given the name &quot;mimivirus&quot; (for &quot;mimicking microbe&quot;) as it resembles a bacterium on Gram staining.

The same team that discovered the mimivirus later discovered a slightly larger virus, dubbed the mamavirus, and the Sputnik virophage that infects it.

==Classification==
&quot;Mimivirus&quot; has been placed into a viral family by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as a member of the &quot;Mimiviridae&quot;, and has been placed into Group I of the Baltimore classification system.

Although not strictly a method of classification, mimivirus joins a group of large viruses known as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). They are all large viruses which share both molecular characteristics and large genomes. The mimivirus genome also possesses 21 genes encoding homologs to proteins which are seen to be highly conserved in the majority of NCLDVs, and further work suggests that mimivirus is an early divergent of the general NCLDV group.

==Structure==

The mimivirus is the fourth-largest virus, after the &quot;Megavirus chilensis&quot;, &quot;Pandoravirus&quot; and &quot;Pithovirus&quot;. Mimivirus has a capsid diameter of 400 nm. Protein filaments measuring 100 nm project from the surface of the capsid, bringing the total length of the virus up to 600 nm. Variation in scientific literature renders these figures as highly approximate, with the &quot;size&quot; of the virion being casually listed as anywhere between 400 nm and 800 nm, depending on whether total length or capsid diameter is actually quoted.

Its capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid symmetry is icosahedral. It does not appear to possess an outer viral envelope, suggesting that the virus does not exit the host cell by exocytosis.
Mimivirus shares several morphological characteristics with all members of the NCLDV group of viruses. The condensed central core of the virion appears as a dark region under the electron microscope. The large genome of the virus resides within this area. An internal lipid layer surrounding the central core is present in all other NCLDV viruses, so this features may also be present in mimivirus.

Several mRNA transcripts can be recovered from purified virions. Like other NCLDVs, transcripts for DNA polymerase, a capsid protein and a TFII-like transcription factor were found. However, three distinct aminoacyl tRNA synthetase enzyme transcripts and four unknown mRNA molecules specific to mimivirus were also found. These pre-packaged transcripts can be translated without viral gene expression and are likely to be necessary to Mimivirus for replication. Other DNA viruses, such as the &quot;Human cytomegalovirus&quot; and &quot;Herpes simplex virus type-1&quot;, also feature pre-packaged mRNA transcripts.
==Genome==
The mimivirus genome is a linear, double-stranded molecule of DNA with 1,181,404 base pairs in length. This makes it one of the largest viral genomes known, outstripping the next-largest virus genome of the &quot;Cafeteria roenbergensis&quot; virus by about 450,000 base pairs. In addition, it is larger than at least 30 cellular clades.

In addition to the large size of the genome, mimivirus possesses an estimated 979 protein-coding genes, far exceeding the minimum 4 genes required for viruses to exist (&quot;c.f.&quot; MS2 and Qβ viruses). Analysis of its genome revealed the presence of genes not seen in any other viruses, including aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and other genes previously thought only to be encoded by cellular organisms. Like other large DNA viruses, mimivirus contains several genes for sugar, lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as some metabolic genes not found in any other virus. Roughly 90% of the genome was of coding capacity, with the other 10% being &quot;junk DNA&quot;.

==Replication==

The stages of mimivirus replication are not well known, but as a minimum it is known that mimivirus attaches to a chemical receptor on the surface of an amoeba cell and is taken into the cell. Once inside, an &quot;eclipse phase&quot; begins, in which the virus disappears and all appears normal within the cell. After about 4 hours small accumulations can be seen in areas of the cell. 8 hours after infection many mimivirus virions are clearly visible within the cell. The cell cytoplasm continues to fill with newly synthesised virions, and about 24 hours after initial infection the cell likely bursts open to release the new mimivirus virions.

Little is known about the details of this replication cycle, most obviously attachment to the cell surface and entry, viral core release, DNA replication, transcription, translation, assembly and release of progeny virions. However, scientists have established the general overview given above using electron micrographs of infected cells. These micrographs show mimivirus capsid assembly in the nucleus, acquisition of an inner lipid membrane via budding from the nucleus, and particles similar to those found in many other viruses, including all NCLDV members. These particles are known in other viruses as &quot;viral factories&quot; and allow efficient viral assembly by modifying large areas of the host cell.
==Pathogenicity==
Mimivirus may be a causative agent of some forms of pneumonia; this is based mainly on indirect evidence in the form of antibodies to the virus discovered in pneumonia patients. However, the classification of mimivirus as a pathogen is tenuous at present as there have been only a couple of papers published potentially linking mimivirus to actual cases of pneumonia. A significant fraction of pneumonia cases are of unknown cause, though a mimivirus has been isolated from a Tunisian woman suffering from pneumonia.
There is evidence that mimivirus can infect macrophages.

<doc id="533649" wikidata="Q452340" url="?curid=533649" title="HSN">
<text>HSN, Inc. an initialism of its former name Home Shopping Network, is an American free-to-air television network owned by the Qurate Retail Group, which also owns catalog company Cornerstone Brands. It is based in the Gateway area of St. Petersburg, Florida, United States.

As of July 2014, Joy Mangano holds the record for most units sold in a day with 216,000 units of pillow sets.

==History==
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell Paxson (who later established PAX-TV, which is now Ion Television) and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.

In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast free-to-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1992, HSN spun off from Silver King Broadcasting, and afterwards saw Liberty Media acquire stock in the network. In 1996, the station group was sold back to Silver King Broadcasting, which was now owned by Barry Diller, and changed its name to &quot;HSN Inc.&quot; after its merger with Silver King was completed. Under Diller&#x27;s leadership, the HSN also acquired the USA Network, Sci-Fi Channel and Universal Television in October 1997. This resulted in HSN Inc. being changed to USA Network Inc. The purchase was finalized in February 1998.

In September 2000, Home Shopping Network changed its name to HSN.

Mindy Grossman became CEO of HSN in 2006, and aggressively reinvented and relaunched the brand. She took HSN public in 2008, and has overseen its multibillion-dollar retail portfolio and multimedia expansion. Grossman left HSNi in May 2017 to helm Weight Watchers.

In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers. On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock it did not already own in order to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the combined company.

In September 2018, HSN had partnered with &quot;Pickler &amp; Ben&quot; for a &quot;shop the show&quot; feature that allows viewers to buy featured items from HSN via the show&#x27;s website and HSN.com.

In May 2023, HSN&#x27;s parent Qurate Retail Group&#x27;s stock was facing a delisting from the Nasdaq if share prices are unable to rebound, as their stock has declined over 80% over the past year. In October 2023, CreditRiskMonitor reported that Qurate Retail Group was nearing a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

==Sister channels==
*HSN2, launched on August 1, 2010, acts as a timeshift channel carrying tape-delayed presentations of products and programming. Dish Network has carried it since launch.
*America&#x27;s Store, formerly the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, was HSN&#x27;s secondary service that was on the air from 1988 until April 2007.

==Operations==
HSN&#x27;s United States operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia &amp; Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California. In October, 2018 Quarate announced the closure of the Roanoke distribution center in favor of a combined QVC/HSN distribution center to be located in Bethlehem, PA.

As of today, HSN and QVC is carried over the digital public airwaves and can be viewed without a cable subscription or a streaming device. Additionally a new Streaming service was introduced to cable providers which provides a different shopping experience compared to if a viewer went online and ordered merchandise.

==Technology==
===Call center===
HSN National began with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the system&#x27;s inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.

===Original order-taking system===
HSN developed its original order-taking system on a Burroughs Large System mainframe using the LINC 10 fourth generation language.

<text>ATLANTIS-2 is a fiber optic transatlantic telecommunications cable connecting Argentina, Brazil, Senegal, Cape Verde, Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands and Portugal. It is the first submarine cable to link South America and the African continent.

The Atlantis 2 project total cost was US$370 million invest by a 25 international carrier consortium led technically and financially by Embratel with more than US$100 million of the investment.

Embratel, which organized the project, also installed two additional fiber pairs of 40 Gbit/s for its exclusive use between Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro.

The cable was ready for service in February 2000 with a launch capacity of 40 Gbit/s. On May 10, to celebrate the definitive start-up of that operation, a videoconference between Fernando Henrique Cardoso (President of Brazil) and António Guterres (Prime Minister of Portugal) was held to demonstrate the new link.

It is approximately 12,000 kilometers in length.
The cable was disconnected on 10 January 2022 due to a consortium decision,
pending upgrades to 160 Gbit/s.

The landing points include:

# Las Toninas, Argentina
# Fortaleza, Brazil
# Praia, Cape Verde
# Dakar, Senegal
# El Médano, Canary Islands, Spain
# Lisbon, Portugal

<doc id="533663" wikidata="Q3187977" url="?curid=533663" title="Judith River">
<text>The Judith River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 124 mi (200 km) long, running through central Montana in the United States. It rises in the Little Belt Mountains and flows northeast past Utica and Hobson. It is joined by Dry Wolf Creek in northern Fergus County, and itself joins the Missouri in the White Cliffs Area approximately 18 mi (29 km) northwest of Winifred.

The river gives its name to the Judith River Group of the late Cretaceous, a notable area for excavation of dinosaur fossils that stretches from Montana into southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan. The river was named by William Clark. William Clark came across a stream which he considered particularly clear and pretty, and named it the Judith River, in honor of his cousin Julia Hancock.
It is also known for its large amount of Cretaceous dinosaur fossils, including those of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; and &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;.

The Judith is a Class I river from the confluence with Big Spring Creek to its confluence with the Missouri River for public access for recreational purposes.

==History==
The Crow tribe called this waterway &quot;Buluhpa’ashe&quot; (“Plum River”). Capt. Meriwether Lewis named this central Montana river the Bighorn. On May 20, 1805, Capt. William Clark renamed it in honor of his future wife, Julia (Judith) Hancock. Beginning in the 1880s, the area surrounding the Judith River at Judith Landing was home to two large ranching operations: the DHS Ranch of A.J. and Erwin Davis, Samuel T. Hauser, and Granville Stuart; and the PN Ranch of Thomas C. Power and G.R. Norris.

White Eagle, &quot;the last major Chief of the Gros Ventre people&quot;, died &quot;at the mouth of the Judith River&quot; on February 9, 1881.

<doc id="533673" wikidata="Q1303218" url="?curid=533673" title="Hafrsfjord">
<text>Hafrsfjord or Hafrsfjorden is a fjord in the Stavanger Peninsula in Rogaland county, Norway. The long fjord forms the border between the municipalities of Stavanger and Sola. On the west side of the fjord is the large village of Tananger, on the south is the village of Solakrossen, and on the east end of the fjord is the borough of Madla in the city of Stavanger. The Møllebukta bay area, located on the innermost part of the fjord, is the site of a popular beach and the Sverd i Fjell statues. The only bridge over the fjord is the Hafrsfjord Bridge which runs between Kvernevik in Stavanger and Jåsund in the village of Tananger in Sola.

Hafrsfjord is also the name of a neighbourhood (&quot;delområde&quot;) in the borough of Madla in the city of Stavanger. It has a population of 4,003, distributed on an area of .

Hafrsfjord is also the location of the KNM Harald Hårfagre, the Basic Training Establishment for the Royal Norwegian Navy. The camp had been used for military purposes since 1871 and in 1934 it was renamed Madlaleiren. In 1952, Parliament decided that the Navy&#x27;s boot camp would be added to the camp and also that the Navy would formally take over the camp. Three years later, the camp was named KNM Harald Hårfagre. Today KNM Harald Hårfagre is the principal training camp for both the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Officer Candidate School for the Navy moved the intake and basic education from Horten to KNM Harald Hårfagre during the summer of 2005.

==Battle of Hafrsfjord==
Historically, the Hafrsfjorden was principally known for its association with the Battle of Hafrsfjord (&quot;Slaget i Hafrsfjord&quot;). King Harald &quot;Fairhair&quot;, the first king of Norway, won a great naval battle during the year 872 which resulted in the unification of Norway into one kingdom. The battle paved the way for Harald to gain control over most of western coast of Norway and rightly call himself king of the country.

In 1983, a monument by Norwegian sculptor and artist Fritz Røed was raised in Møllebukta at the northeasternmost end of the Hafrsfjorden. The monument is called Sverd i Fjell (Swords in Rock) and represents the Battle of Hafrsfjord. The crowns on the top of the swords represent the three districts that participated in the battle.

==Name==
The modern form of the name should be &quot;Haffjorden&quot;, but because of its historical significance the Old Norse form of the name has been revived. The first element is the genitive case of &quot;hafr&quot; which means &#x27;male goat&#x27; and &quot;fjord&quot; means &#x27;fjord&#x27;. &quot;Hafr&quot; might have been the name of a skerry at the narrow entrance of the fjord.

<doc id="533675" wikidata="Q1520324" url="?curid=533675" title="Serge (fabric)">
<text>Serge is a type of twill fabric that has diagonal lines or ridges on both inner and outer surfaces via a two-up, two-down weave. The worsted variety is used in making military uniforms, suits, greatcoats, and trench coats. Its counterpart, silk serge, is used for linings. French serge is a softer, finer variety. The word is also used for a high-quality woven woolen fabric.

== Etymology ==
The name is derived from Old French , itself from Latin , from Greek (), meaning &#x27;silken&#x27;.

== History ==
The early association of silk serge, Greece, and France is shown by the discovery in Charlemagne&#x27;s tomb of a piece of silk serge dyed with Byzantine motifs, evidently a gift from the Byzantine Imperial Court in the 8th or 9th century AD.

It also appears to refer to a form of silk twill produced in the early renaissance in or around Florence, used for clerical cassocks. A reference can be found in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;:

From early Saxon times, most English wool (&quot;staples&quot;) was exported. In the early 16th century it went mainly to a Royal monopoly at Calais (then an English possession) and was woven into cloth in France or the Low Countries. However, with the French taking possession of the town during the Siege of Calais on 7 January 1558, England began expanding its own weaving industry. This was greatly enhanced by the European Wars of Religion (Eighty Years&#x27; War, French Wars of Religion); in 1567 Calvinist refugees from the Low Countries included many skilled serge weavers, while Huguenot refugees in the early 18th century included many silk and linen weavers.

Wool worsted serges are known from the 12th century onward. Modern serges are made with worsted warp and a woollen weft.

Denim is a cotton fabric with a similar weave; its name is believed to be derived from after Nîmes in France.

== Say ==
Say or Saye was a lighter serge variety. It was thin woolen stuff of twilled structure.

<text>Stephan Thomas Pastis ( ; born January 16, 1968) is an American cartoonist and former lawyer who is the creator of the comic strip &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;. He also writes children&#x27;s chapter books, commencing with the release of &quot;Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made&quot;. The seventh book, &quot;It&#x27;s the End When I Say It&#x27;s the End&quot;, debuted at #4 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for Children&#x27;s Middle Grade Books.

==Background==
The son of Greek immigrants, Pastis was raised in San Marino, California. He started cartooning as a child; his mother brought him pens and paper to amuse him when he was &quot;sick a lot&quot; and had to stay in bed. He attended the University of California at Berkeley, earning a B.A. in political science in 1989. The next year, Pastis attended law school at UCLA, where he received his J.D. He kept drawing during this time, coming up with the first &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; character, Rat, during what he said was a boring class in law school. When I wrote for him [Rat] it seemed pretty honest. It was the first character where I could really say what&#x27;s on my mind. When I put it on paper, it&#x27;s my voice. So it works for me.

From 1993 to 2002, Pastis was an insurance defense litigation attorney in the San Francisco Bay area, but he quickly became disenchanted with the legal profession. He did not like its adversarial nature or &quot;the anxiety and tension it produced&quot;, so in the mid-1990s he revisited his earlier ambition of becoming a syndicated cartoonist by submitting various concepts to syndication agencies. &quot;The Infirm&quot;, &quot;Rat&quot;, &quot;Bradbury Road&quot;, and others were repeatedly rejected.

==&quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;==

The character Rat came from Pastis&#x27;s earlier strip, &quot;Rat&quot;. The character Pig, who is Rat&#x27;s opposite, had been featured in &quot;The Infirm&quot;, which was about an attorney who numbered an evil pig farmer among his clients. Although Pastis had developed the characters, they were still just stick figures with jokes. One day in 1996, Pastis drove to an ice rink in Santa Rosa where Charles Schulz, the creator of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, had his coffee every day. The meeting did not begin auspiciously, as Pastis blurted out: &quot;Hi, Sparky [Schulz&#x27;s nickname], my name is Stephan Pastis and I&#x27;m a lawyer.&quot; Schulz turned pale, thinking Pastis was there to serve him with a subpoena. But he recovered, and Pastis remembers Schulz&#x27;s graciousness: I was a total stranger to him, and he let me sit down at his table and we talked for an hour. I took a picture with him. He looked at some of the strips that I had been doing and gave me some tips. Man, I was on cloud nine.

In addition to &quot;Peanuts&quot;, Pastis drew inspiration from &quot;Dilbert&quot;. What worked for me personally was to study the writing of Dilbert. I just bought a bunch of Dilbert books and studied how to write a 3-panel strip. Then I showed them to a group of people who were acquaintances (but not quite friends) in order to get their honest assessment of which ones were funny and which ones weren&#x27;t. As to the ins and outs of getting syndicated, I bought a book called &quot;Your Career in the Comics&quot; by Lee Nordling.

Pastis drew about 200 strips for the new comic and selected 40 of the best, but fearing more rejection, let them sit on his basement counter for the next two years. Only in 1999, when he visited the grave of a college friend who had been a free spirit and had encouraged him to be the same, did he overcome his fear and submit the strips to three different syndicates, including United Features. United took the unprecedented step of first running the strips on Comics.com to gauge reader response. When Scott Adams, &quot;Dilbert&quot;&#x27;s creator, whom Pastis had never met, endorsed the strip, the response &quot;went through the roof&quot;.

Pastis also credits &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; cartoonist Darby Conley with contributing to the strip&#x27;s development. They met through their syndication attorney, and Conley taught him how to color the Sunday strips and add gray tones to the dailies, which people call &quot;halftone&quot;.

Eight months later, Pastis gleefully quit his law practice. He considers his dissatisfaction with law helpful insofar as &quot;humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness&quot;, and wanting to leave his job gave him the impetus to create better comic strips so that he could get syndicated.

Fifteen years later, &quot;Pearls&quot; was still one of the fastest-growing comic strips, appearing in more than 650 newspapers worldwide. Pastis generally works five to nine months ahead of deadline, a rarity in the world of newspaper comics.

In June 2014, Pastis collaborated with Bill Watterson, the creator of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, on a weeklong storyline in which a second-grade girl, Libby, wrote a few of Pastis&#x27;s cartoon frames for him. Pastis says that collaborating with Bill Watterson is like glimpsing &quot;Bigfoot&quot;. After the strips were published, Pastis revealed that the artwork for three of the strips was in fact by Watterson. In the last cartoon of the sequence, Libby explains to Pastis that she will not continue drawing strips, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a magical world out there&quot;, a reference to the words Calvin speaks in the final strip of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;.

===Treasuries===

Pastis&#x27;s first treasury, &quot;Sgt. Piggy&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Comic&quot;, was published in 2004. In addition to the content of the previous books, &quot;BLTs Taste So Darn Good&quot; and &quot;This Little Piggy Stayed Home&quot;, and Sunday strips in full color, Pastis included responses from readers and a section in which he explained why certain strips were not successful, and how he would fix them. He continues to release the treasuries about one every year and a half. Each book in the series is subtitled &quot;A &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; Treasury&quot;. Recently, treasuries became the main format for Pearls Before Swine books, retiring the smaller collections.

==Personal life==

Pastis lives in Santa Rosa, California, with his wife Staci and two children, where he is on the board of the Charles Schulz Museum, helping with merchandising rights issues and answering questions about &quot;Peanuts&quot;.
Schulz is to comic strips what Marlon Brando was to acting. It was so revolutionary. Before &quot;Peanuts&quot;, the writing was physical, over the top, but Sparky goes inside the soul. His influence on me is enormous. I&#x27;ve taken his backgrounds, the front porch, the beach and the TV beanbag. Rat is Lucy, Goat is Linus and Pig is Charlie Brown. Sparky is a template. Whether or not you know it, he&#x27;s the template.

In 2011, Pastis cowrote the Peanuts special &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown&quot;.

==&quot;Timmy Failure&quot;==
On February 25, 2013, Pastis released his first book aimed at younger readers, &quot;Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made&quot;, from Candlewick Press. Modeled after the popular &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; series, &quot;Timmy Failure&quot; follows the exploits of a young detective-to-be and his polar bear friend, Total, as they solve crimes in their neighborhood. A sequel, &quot;Timmy Failure: Now Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot;, was released on February 25, 2014. A third book, &quot;Timmy Failure: We Meet Again&quot;, was released on October 28, 2014. The fourth book, &quot;Timmy Failure: Sanitized for Your Protection&quot;, was released on October 6, 2015. The fifth, &quot;Timmy Failure: The Book You&#x27;re Not Supposed To Have&quot;, was released on September 27, 2016. The sixth, &quot;Timmy Failure: The Cat Stole My Pants&quot; was released on April 25, 2017, and the seventh, &quot;Timmy Failure: It&#x27;s The End When I Say It&#x27;s The End&quot;, was released in September 2018. A prequel to the series, &quot;Zero to Hero&quot; (&quot;Volume 0&quot;) (2020) is the eighth.

===Film adaptation===

In April 2017, Disney started work on a &quot;Timmy Failure&quot; movie with Tom McCarthy directing and co-writing with Pastis. The film was released on Disney&#x27;s family-oriented streaming service Disney+ in January 2020 with the titular character being portrayed by Winslow Fegley. The film was shot from July to September 2018 in Portland, Oregon.

==Awards==
Pastis was nominated for the National Cartoonists Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2014. He won the 2003, 2006, and 2014 awards. He was also nominated for The National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award for Cartoonist of the Year for every year since 2008, winning in 2018.

<doc id="533694" wikidata="Q1228240" url="?curid=533694" title="Dirty Mind">
<text>Dirty Mind is the third studio album by the American singer-songwriter and musician Prince. It was released on October 8, 1980, by Warner Bros. Records.

The album is notable for Prince&#x27;s increasing reliance on rock music elements, high register vocals, sexually explicit lyrical themes and an androgynous image. Critics have hailed its fusion of genres for influencing urban black music of the early 1980s, and its lyrics for influencing more sexually explicit music.

The first single from &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, &quot;Uptown&quot;, reached number five on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles and the &quot;Billboard&quot; National Disco Action Top 30 charts. Although the album only reached number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it was met with widespread critical acclaim. The album has retrospectively been ranked by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Slant&quot; as one of the greatest of the 1980s, and by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; as one of the greatest albums of all time.

==Composition and recording==
A fusion of funk, new wave, R&amp;B and dance, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; also contains more rock-oriented beats than Prince&#x27;s previous albums, as well as elements of punk rock on the track &quot;Sister&quot;. Half of the songs were composed by Prince on tour, when he and his band had a slot opening for Rick James.

The album was recorded in a makeshift 16-track studio in the basement of Prince&#x27;s home on Lake Minnetonka, with Prince engineering the album himself, credited under the pseudonym Jamie Starr. Sessions occurred in May and June 1980, with Prince playing nearly all of the instruments himself, and several of the songs were recorded in one night. The album contrasted with Prince&#x27;s previous ones in its raw and unpolished production style, with several of the tracks being essentially demos. The production presents a clean sound with minimal distortion or reverb, more akin to power pop or punk rock. Barry Walters of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; later observed that, &quot;Whereas Prince&#x27;s &#x27;70s albums proclaimed his virtuosity, here he achieves much more by confining himself to the simplest, boldest strokes.&quot; It is the only Prince album to not feature a &quot;slow jam&quot;.

===Side one===
The core riff of &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; was originally a jam devised by keyboardist Doctor Fink for Prince&#x27;s band. He and Prince recorded it in one evening and Prince finished it the next morning. The song is set to a metronomic disco beat, likened by Walters to the motorik beat of Krautrock. The song melds Minneapolis funk with new wave and post-punk, featuring falsetto singing and percussive guitar, as well as &quot;tinny keyboard hooks&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the song as &quot;robotic funk&quot;. Walters notes that the song&#x27;s descending key changes mixed with ascending church organ chords are &quot;a particularly Prince-like juxtaposition that offers a peek-a-boo glimpse into the convolutions—sexual and otherwise—of his psyche.&quot; 

&quot;When You Were Mine&quot; was written in a Florida hotel room. John Freeman of &quot;The Quietus&quot; deemed the song Prince&#x27;s &quot;first great rock song&quot;, featuring &quot;frantic guitars&quot; and &quot;squidgy keyboards&quot;. It has been classified by several critics as new wave and likened to the works of Elvis Costello. Lyrically, the song contains elements of gender bending, as well as voyeurism and cuckoldry, and Freeman noted that the song&#x27;s dynamic forecasted later Prince tracks like &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;, &quot;Paisley Park&quot; and &quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot;. The track is one of Prince&#x27;s most covered songs and was recorded by Cyndi Lauper for her 1983 album &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;. 

&quot;Do It All Night&quot; contains &quot;sultry funk&quot;, with Kenneth Partridge of &quot;Billboard&quot; noting the chorus&#x27; &quot;urgent sixteenth-note keyboards underscoring Prince&#x27;s [sexual] eagerness&quot;. &quot;Gotta Broken Heart Again&quot;, a minimalistic ballad featuring &quot;effortless falsetto&quot;, &quot;breezy piano&quot;, and &quot;soulful crooning&quot;, forecasts Prince&#x27;s work on his 1986 album &quot;Parade&quot;. 

===Side two===
&quot;Uptown&quot;, another song featuring a heavy disco beat, is billed by Partridge as a &quot;utopian funk-rock anthem [...] about racial and sexual tolerance&quot;, melding the styles of Kool &amp; the Gang and the Clash. Walters hailed it as being &quot;among the most daring R&amp;B radio hits of the &#x27;80s&quot;, due to its lyrical themes about &quot;how homophobia constricts even heterosexuals&quot;:

&quot;Head&quot; and &quot;Sister&quot; are both among Prince&#x27;s &quot;most infamous&quot; and &quot;notorious&quot; songs. Freeman stated that &quot;Head&quot; &quot;outlines the shameless seduction of a bride-to-be with the promise of oral delights, over a sweating, squelching synth hook.&quot; Walters noted its significantly slower tempo and deemed it &quot;one of the earliest fully realized manifestations of Prince&#x27;s quintessential style.&quot; Partridge observed that the song &quot;reads like a letter to &quot;Penthouse Forum&quot;&quot;, while noting &quot;Dr. Fink&#x27;s squiggly sci-fi keyboards&quot;.

The brief &quot;Sister&quot; was billed by Freeman as &quot;Prince&#x27;s most furious punk song&quot; and a &quot;piss-take&quot;. Walters stated that the song &quot;celebrates incest like the rest of the record toys with sexual identity; it&#x27;s blatantly performative&quot;, and felt that the music, with its Ramones-like guitars and constantly changing time signatures, echoed the unstable nature of the lyrics. Partridge also noted its lyrical ambiguity, calling the song &quot;a filthy romp as audacious and fun as anything the Sex Pistols ever did.&quot;

The music for &quot;Partyup&quot; was originally penned by Morris Day, in a period where he and Prince were hanging out and jamming together regularly. Day has stated that the original track he recorded, consisting of only bass and drums, was &quot;a lot slower and funkier&quot;, and that he was unhappy with the funk-rock direction in which Prince ultimately took the song. Musically, Walters observed that the song is &quot;uncut funk with louder guitars and tunes so catchy you can&#x27;t deny the pop.&quot; Freeman billed the song as a &quot;good-time freak out jam, with Prince extolling the merits of &#x27;revolutionary rock &amp; roll&#x27;.&quot; Lyrically, the song finds Prince &quot;furious [...] at war&quot;, inspired by then-President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1980 reinstatement of military draft registration, and features a &quot;&#x27;60s-worthy closing chant&quot;. Partridge deemed it &quot;the most danceable anti-war anthem since Edwin Starr&#x27;s &#x27;War.&#x27;&quot; To compensate Day for writing the music, Prince created the Time as a vehicle for Day, and the two created the band&#x27;s first three albums almost entirely by themselves.

==Release==
&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Black Albums chart. The first single, &quot;Uptown&quot;, reached number five on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles and Dance Club Songs charts, but only 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The title track was released as the second single and was modestly successful on the R&amp;B chart. The songs &quot;Uptown&quot;, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, and &quot;Head&quot; were released together, reaching the dance chart&#x27;s top five.

On June 6, 1984, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Following the death of Prince in 2016, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and also entered the album charts in France, Switzerland and the UK for the first time.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; earned widespread acclaim from music critics. According to the writer Simon Reynolds, the album&#x27;s &quot;rave reception [...] saw rock critics anointing [Prince] as the genre-crossing, gender-bending, races-uniting saviour of modern music&quot;. Reynolds quotes Barney Hoskyns, who in his &quot;New Musical Express&quot; review of &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; described it as &quot;the glam-funk &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;.&quot;

Ken Tucker of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album finds Prince shifting from the &quot;doe-eyed romantic&quot; of his first two records to a &quot;liberating lewdness&quot; which &quot;jolts with the unsettling tension that arises from rubbing complex erotic wordplay against clean, simple melodies&quot;, all along an &quot;electric surface&quot;. Tucker remarked on how Prince casually delivers lyrics with a &quot;graceful quaver&quot; and &quot;exhilarating breathlessness&quot;, combining &quot;the sweet romanticism of Smokey Robinson&quot; and &quot;the powerful vulgate poetry of Richard Pryor&quot;. He concluded that the album was &quot;cool music dealing with hot emotions&quot;, and, &quot;at its best [...] positively filthy&quot;. Writing that same month in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau found the music&#x27;s &quot;metallic textures and simple drum patterns&quot; comparable to both Funkadelic and the Rolling Stones, while acknowledging Prince as being in the generally shy-mannered &quot;love-man&quot; tradition because of his falsetto singing, but ultimately distinct in his &quot;aggressively, audaciously erotic&quot; character: &quot;I&#x27;m talking about your basic fuckbook fantasies—the kid sleeps with his sister and digs it, sleeps with his girlfriend&#x27;s boyfriend and doesn&#x27;t, and stops a wedding by gamahuching the bride on her way to church. I mean, Mick Jagger can just fold up his penis and go home.&quot;

Retrospective appraisals have also been positive. In &quot;The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records&quot; (1983), &quot;Trouser Press&quot; writer Jim Green stated, &quot;If the ultra sex obsession doesn&#x27;t put you off, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;&#x27;s catchy tunes, sly lyrics, and strong production, and Prince&#x27;s trademark falsetto make for a winning combination.&quot; Erlewine described the album as a &quot;stunning, audacious amalgam of funk, new wave, R&amp;B, and pop, fueled by grinningly salacious sex and the desire to shock&quot;. According to Michaelangelo Matos in &quot;(The New) Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; remains one of the most radical 180-degree turns in pop history.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the music as a &quot;confident and highly danceable blend of post-disco funk and tasty, hard-line rock&quot;, while Keith Harris of &quot;Blender&quot; credited it for setting &quot;confessions of a sex junkie&quot; to the sounds of &quot;new-wave funk&quot;. Walters deemed it Prince&#x27;s &quot;first fully actualized album&quot; and &quot;an unrelenting dance party that pointedly invited New Wavers to boogie down alongside funk bunnies and dancefloor fashionistas.&quot; Freeman opined that &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; was Prince&#x27;s most creative and boldest album, setting the standard for his artistic direction in the following years. Partridge called the album an &quot;absolute essential — an eight-song, 30-minute glimpse into the mind of a thong-rocking pacifist with some interesting ideas about marriage and sibling relations&quot;, and added that it &quot;benefits from its complete lack of outside perspective.&quot;

==Legacy==
In their list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; &quot;marked Prince&#x27;s coming of age. It was the first album on which he successfully synthesized the rock and soul he had grown up on into a vibrant, strikingly original sound, at the same time turning his own sexuality and flamboyance into a clear-cut style and stance.&quot; Walters billed the album as a &quot;landmark album&quot; that &quot;couldn&#x27;t be purer punk&quot;, due to its rejection of &quot;labels, restrictions, and authority.&quot;

Due to &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;&#x27;s fusion of genres, Erlewine observed that it &quot;set the style for much of the urban soul and funk of the early &#x27;80s.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that &quot;Prince&#x27;s keyboard-dominated &#x27;Minneapolis sound&#x27; became the blueprint for a generation of soul, funk and pop groups. His influence is evident in songs ranging from Ready for the World&#x27;s &#x27;Oh Sheila&#x27; to Fine Young Cannibals&#x27; &#x27;She Drives Me Crazy.&#x27;&quot; Walters hailed it as &quot;one of the key records that truly initiated the &#x27;80s.&quot; In Christgau&#x27;s opinion, Prince&#x27;s impact as a &quot;commercially viable&quot; yet &quot;visionary&quot; artist with the album was comparable to John Lennon, Bob Dylan, and Jimi Hendrix. 

Walters also noted Prince&#x27;s &quot;free and startlingly girly&quot; vocals, as well as his androgynous image during this era, adding, &quot;it can&#x27;t be underestimated how much Prince quite threateningly set off gaydar&quot;. Partridge noted that &quot;Prince wasn&#x27;t the first R&amp;B artist to sing in falsetto, but the daring femininity he brings to this performance paints him as a different sort of lover-man.&quot; Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted the songs&#x27; prominently sexual lyrics. Erlewine credited the album&#x27;s explicit themes, including oral sex, threesomes and ejaculation, for opening the doors for sexually explicit albums in the following years. 

&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; has ranked highly on professional lists of the greatest albums. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number 87 on a list of the 100 best albums from the 1980s, while &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked it 53rd on a similar list. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 393 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has ranked it number 326 among the magazine&#x27;s 500 greatest albums of all time (published in 2020) and 18th among albums from the 1980s.

<text>Agyrrhius/Agyrrhios () of the deme Collytus in Attica, was an Athenian politician in the final years of the 5th and early years of the 4th century BCE. His best-known accomplishment was the establishment of pay for attendance at meetings of the &quot;Ekklesia&quot; (Assembly), in reward for which (apparently) he was elected general in 390/89. He was also named as one of the proposers of a decree to reduce payments to the comic poets. Harpokration gave him credit for establishing the &quot;theorika&quot; (festival fund) so the poor could attend theater performances, but this attribution is contested by some scholars.

His reputation was mixed. The orator Andokides accused him in 399 of conspiring to rig the bidding on tax collection contracts in 401 and 400 in order to defraud the city of its normal revenues. In response Agyrrhios joined several others in indicting Andokides for impiety - a charge which Andokides successfully refuted in court. According to the orator Demosthenes, Agyrrhios later spent many years in jail &quot;until he had repaid the money in his possession which was adjudged to be public property&quot;. 

Aristophanes lampooned Agyrrhios in two plays: 

&quot;Ekklesiazusai&quot; (&quot;Women of the Assembly&quot;):Even a woman-looking man, like Agyrrhios looks like a man-looking woman, now that he&#x27;s wearing Pronomous&#x27; beard! Agyrrhios, ey? Remember him! That crooked, filthy rich politician! Agyrrhios! Rules the whole city, the bastard!  It&#x27;s because of him that we should try and accomplish this daring deed today, girls. (100 ff.)&quot;Ploutos&quot; (&quot;Wealth&quot;), referring to Agyrrhios&#x27; frequent harangues in the Ekklesia where he proposed policies that would benefit him financially:Doesn&#x27;t Agyrrhios fart because of it? (190)

<text>Columbus-III was a transatlantic telecommunications cable connecting Europe to North America.

==History and details==
&quot;Columbus-III&quot; entered service since December 1999 and it&#x27;s owned by over 30 carriers. Supported by 90 repeaters, it&#x27;s 9833 km long.

After a 2009 upgrade, the capacity of the system between the United States and Portugal was increased from the original design capacity of 8 x 2.5 Gbit/s to 160 Gbit/s initially. The upgraded system could accommodate up to 320 Gbit/s with potential to go even further beyond.

The cable was decommissioned in December 2020.

<doc id="533706" wikidata="Q1661279" url="?curid=533706" title="Indian Script Code for Information Interchange">
<text>Indian Standard Code for Information Interchange (ISCII) is a coding scheme for representing various writing systems of India. It encodes the main Indic scripts and a Roman transliteration. The supported scripts are: Bengali–Assamese, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu. ISCII does not encode the writing systems of India that are based on Persian, but its writing system switching codes nonetheless provide for Kashmiri, Sindhi, Urdu, Persian, Pashto and Arabic. The Persian-based writing systems were subsequently encoded in the PASCII encoding.

ISCII has not been widely used outside certain government institutions, although a variant without the mechanism was used on classic Mac OS, Mac OS Devanagari, and it has now been rendered largely obsolete by Unicode. Unicode uses a separate block for each Indic writing system, and largely preserves the ISCII layout within each block.

==Background==

The Brahmi-derived writing systems have similar structure. So ISCII encodes letters with the same phonetic value at the same code point, overlaying the various scripts. For example, the ISCII codes 0xB3 0xDB represent [ki]. This will be rendered as കി in Malayalam, कि in Devanagari, as ਕਿ in Gurmukhi, and as கி in Tamil. The writing system can be selected in rich text by markup or in plain text by means of the code described below.

One motivation for the use of a single encoding is the idea that it will allow easy transliteration from one writing system to another. However, there are enough incompatibilities that this is not really a practical idea. 

ISCII is an 8-bit encoding. The lower 128 code points are plain ASCII, the upper 128 code points are ISCII-specific. In addition to the code points representing characters, ISCII makes use of a code point with mnemonic that indicates that the following byte contains one of two kinds of information. One set of values changes the writing system until the next writing system indicator or end-of-line. Another set of values select display modes such as bold and italic. ISCII does not provide a means of indicating the default writing system.

== Codepage layout ==

The following table shows the character set for Devanagari. The code sets for Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu are similar, with each Devanagari form replaced by the equivalent form in each writing system. Each character is shown with its decimal code and its Unicode equivalent.

== Special code points ==

; INV character—code point D9 (217): The INV (invisible consonant) character is used as a pseudo-consonant to display combining elements in isolation. For example, क (ka) + ् (halant) + INV = क्‍ (half ka). The Unicode equivalent is (). However, as noted below, the ISCII halant character can be doubled or combined with the ISCII nukta to achieve effects created by or ZWJ in Unicode. For this reason, Apple maps the ISCII INV character to the Unicode , so as to guarantee round-tripping.
; ATR character—code point EF (239): The ATR (attribute) character followed by a byte code is used to switch to a different font attribute (such as bold) or to a different ISCII or PASCII language (such as Bengali), up to the next ATR sequence or the end of the line. This has no direct Unicode equivalent, as font attributes are not part of Unicode, and each script has a distinct set of code points.

; EXT character—code point F0 (240): The EXT (extensions for Vedic) character followed by a byte code indicates a Vedic accent. This has no direct Unicode equivalent, as Vedic accents are assigned to distinct code points.
; Halant character ्—code point E8 (232): The halant character removes the implicit vowel from a consonant and is used between consonants to represent conjunct consonants. For example, क (ka) + ् (halant) + त (ta) = क्त (kta). The sequence ् (halant) + ् (halant) displays a conjunct with an explicit halant, for example क (ka) + ् (halant) + ् (halant) + त (ta) = क्‌त. The sequence ् (halant) + ़ (nukta) displays a conjunct with half consonants, if available, for example क (ka) + ् (halant) + ़ (nukta) + त (ta) = क्‍त.

; Nukta character ़—code point E9 (233): The nukta character after another ISCII character is used for a number of rarer characters which don&#x27;t exist in the main ISCII set. For example क (ka) + ़ (nukta) = क़ (qa). These characters have precomposed forms in Unicode, as shown in the following table.

<doc id="533710" wikidata="Q567314" url="?curid=533710" title="Islam in Germany">
<text>Islam&#x27;s significance in Germany has largely increased after the labour migration in the 1960s and several waves of political refugees since the 1970s.

According to a representative survey, it is estimated that in 2019, there were 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background in Germany (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background. A similar survey in 2016 estimated a number of 4.4–4.7 million Muslims with a migrant background (5.4–5.7% of the population) at that time. An older survey in 2009 estimated a total number of up to 4.3 million Muslims in Germany at that time. There are also higher estimates: according to the German Islam Conference, Muslims represented 7% of the population in Germany in 2012.

In a 2014 academic publication, it was estimated that some 20,000-100,000 Germans converted to Islam, numbers which are comparable to those in France and in the United Kingdom.

==Demographics==

Islam is the largest minority religion in the country, with the Protestant and Roman Catholic confessions being the majority religions.
Most Muslims in Germany have roots in Turkey, followed by Arab countries, former Yugoslavia (mostly of Kosovo-Albanian or Bosnian origin), as well as Iranic countries (Afghanistan, Tajkistan, Pakistan, Kurdistan &amp; Iran). There are also a significant minority originated from Sub-Saharan Africa (mostly East Africa). The large majority of Muslims live in former West Germany, including West Berlin. However, unlike in most other European countries, sizeable Muslim communities exist in some rural regions of Germany, especially Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and parts of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. Owing to the lack of labour immigration before 1989, there are only very few Muslims in the former East Germany. Among the German districts with the highest share of Muslim migrants are Groß-Gerau (district) and Offenbach (district) according to migrants data from the census 2011. The majority of Muslims in Germany are Sunnis, at 75%. There are Shia Muslims (7%) and mostly from Iran.

From the mid-2000s to 2016 there has been a surge migrants to Germany from outside Europe. Of the 680,000 regular migrants, 270,000 were Muslim. Additionally, of the 1,210,000 asylum seekers mainly from the Syrian civil war, 900,000 were Muslim (around 74%). Of the asylum seekers, 580,000 applicants were approved and 320,000 were denied or expected to be denied. According to the Pew Research Center, similar patterns of Muslim migration to Germany should be expected in the future and the Muslim population share is expected to grow.

In 2020 the Deutsche Islamkonferenz, based on a study, estimated between 5.3 and 5.6 million Muslims lived in Germany.

When in June 2024 the results of the 2022 census were published by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, it became evident, that the German government does not know how many Muslims live in Germany and where they are located. While the number and localisation of citizens attributed to major Christian denominations could be pulled from Resident registration, no such data were available on unrecognized religious communities. Furthermore questions about religious believes had been dropped from the 2022 census questionnaire.

==History==
===Early history===

Muslims first moved to Germany as part of the diplomatic, military and economic relations between Germany and the Ottoman Empire in the eighteenth century. Twenty Muslim soldiers served under Frederick William I of Prussia, at the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1745, Frederick II of Prussia established a unit of Muslims in the Prussian army called the &quot;Muslim Riders&quot; and consisting mainly of Bosniaks, Albanians and Tatars. In 1760 a Bosnian Muslim corps was established with about 1,000 men. In 1798 a Muslim cemetery was established in Berlin. The cemetery, which moved in 1866, still exists today. A number of German philosophers expressed sympathy for Islam, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (who particularly admired the Sufi poetry of Hafez) and later Friedrich Nietzsche (in &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, he claimed that the Germanic spirit was closer to the Moors of Al-Andalus than that of Greece, Rome and Christianity).

The German Empire had over two million Muslim subjects, mostly Sunnis, in overseas colonies. The Majority lived in German East Africa. Several Muslim revolts against German colonial rule occurred, including the Adamawa Campaign, Maji Maji Rebellion and Abushiri revolt.

===1920s to the 1940s===
The Islamic Institut Ma&#x27;ahad-ul-Islam was founded in 1927 and is now known under the name &quot;Zentralinstitut Islam-Archiv-Deutschland&quot; (Central Islamic Archive Institute) and is the oldest such institution in Germany. Shortly after its founding the Nazi Party came to power the archive was forced to suspend all further work, until after the war.
During World War II Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini energetically recruited Muslims from occupied territories into several divisions of the Waffen SS (primarily the 13th &quot;Waffen&quot; Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Handschar&quot; (1st Croatian) and 21st &quot;Waffen&quot; Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Skanderbeg&quot;) and some other units.

In September 1943 Hitler specifically decreed that Muslim Germans could be members of the party as well as people of Christian denominations.

===Post-war Germany===
After the West German Government invited foreign workers (&quot;Gastarbeiter&quot;) in 1961, the figure sharply rose to currently 4.3 million (most of them Turkish from the rural region of Anatolia in southeast Turkey). They are sometimes called a parallel society within ethnic Germans.

According to the German statistical office 9.1% of all newborns in Germany had Muslim parents in 2005.

In 2017, Muslims and Islamic institutions were targeted by attacks 950 times, where houses are painted with Nazi symbols, hijab-wearing women are harassed, threatening letters are sent and 33 people were injured. In nearly all cases, the perpetrators were right-wing extremists.

In May 2018 a court in Berlin upheld the right to the state&#x27;s neutrality principle by barring a primary school teacher from wearing a headscarf during classes, where the court spokesman stated that children should be free of the influence that can be exerted by religious symbols.

According to a study in 2018 by Leipzig University, 56% of Germans sometimes thought the many Muslims made them feel like strangers in their own country, up from 43% in 2014. In 2018, 44% thought immigration by Muslims should be banned, up from 37% in 2014.

In December 2018, the government of Germany strengthened the control of Saudi, Kuwaiti and Qatari funding for radical mosque congregations. The measure was recommended by an anti-terrorist agency in Berlin (German: &quot;Terrorismus-Abwehrzentrum&quot;) which since 2015 had started to monitor Safalist proselytizing funding in the wake of the European migrant crisis to prevent refugees from becoming radicalized. Henceforth Gulf authorities are required to report payments and funding to the German Federal Foreign Office (German: &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;).

Between 2010 and 2016, the number of Muslims living in Germany increased from 3.3 million (4.1% of the population) to nearly 5 million (6.1%). The most important factor in the growth of Germany&#x27;s Muslim population is immigration.

In December 2018, there were no official statistics on how much funding mosques in Germany received from abroad.

In July 2020, federal state Baden-Württemberg banned face-covering veils for school pupils as an extension of the ban which was already in force for staff.

==Denominations==

Muslims in Germany belong to several different branches of Islam (approximate data):
* Sunnis 2,640,000
* Alevis 500,000
* Twelvers Shi&#x27;as 225,500
* Alawites 70,000
* Ahmadiyya 35,000-45,000
* Salafis 10,300
* Sufis 10,000
* Ismailis 1,900
* Zaydis 800
* Ibadis 270

==Islamic organisations==
Only a minority of the Muslims residing in Germany are members of religious associations.

===Sunni===
* Diyanet İşleri Türk İslam Birliği (DİTİB): German branch of the Turkish Presidency for Religious Affairs, Cologne. As of 2016, the Turkish government funds and provides staff for 900 of Germany&#x27;s roughly 3000 mosques run by DİTİB.
* Islamische Gemeinschaft Milli Görüş: close to the Islamist Saadet Partisi in Turkey, Kerpen near Cologne
* Islamische Gemeinschaft Jamaat un-Nur (de): German branch of the Risale-i Nur Society (Said Nursi)
* Islamische Gemeinschaft in Deutschland organization of Arab Muslims close to the Muslim Brotherhood, Frankfurt

In addition there are numerous local associations without affiliation to any of these organisations. Two organisations have been banned in 2002 because their programme was judged as contrary to the constitution: The &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot; and the so-called &quot;Caliphate State&quot; founded by Cemalettin Kaplan and later led by his son Metin Kaplan.

===Shia===
* Islamische Gemeinschaft der schiitischen Gemeinden Deutschlands (IGS): Head organization that unite all Shiite mosques and associations in Germany, with being the Islamic Centre Hamburg the most important Shia mosque in Germany.
* Al-Mustafa Institut Berlin: A branch of the Al-Mustafa International University in Qum, Iran to Islamic theology to students in Germany and Europe.

===Ahmadiyya===
* Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat Deutschland K.d.ö.R.: German branch of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Community. There is no ethnicity or race associated with this community although most of the members of the community residing in Germany are of Pakistani origin. The Ahmadiyya Community was established in Germany in 1923 in Berlin and is one of the largest in Europe. Communities exist in Baden-Württemberg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Bremen.
* Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement: German branch of the worldwide Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement.

===Liberal Islam===
* Ibn Ruschd-Goethe mosque in Berlin was founded by Seyran Ateş. The liberal mosque has been condemned by the Turkish religious authority and the Egyptian Fatwa Council at the Al-Azhar University.
* Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought

=== Wahhabism ===
* King Fahd Academy, sponsored by Saudi Arabia. The school was closed at the end of the 2016/2017 school year, after long-running criticism that it was attracting Islamists to Germany.
* According to the FFGI at Goethe University Frankfurt, wahhabist ideology is spread in Germany as in other European country mostly by an array of informal, personal and organisational networks, where organisations closely associated with the government of Saudi Arabia such as the Muslim World League (WML) and the World Association of Muslim Youth are actively participating.

===Others===
* Verband der islamischen Kulturzentren: German branch of the conservative Süleymancı sect in Turkey, Cologne
* Verband der Islamischen Gemeinden der Bosniaken: Bosnian Muslims, Kamp-Lintfort near Duisburg
* Zentralinstitut Islam-Archiv-Deutschland e.V. : Documentary of Islamic Foundation-writings since 1739. The Islamic Institute was founded in 1942 (Sooner called Ma&#x27;ahad-ul-Islam Institut).

===Umbrella organisations===
Furthermore, there are the following umbrella organisations:
* Central Council of Muslims in Germany (Zentralrat der Muslime in Deutschland)
* Islamic Council in Germany (Islamrat in Deutschland)

=== Education ===
* The &quot;A-Nur-Kita&quot; preschool was closed in February 2019 due to its parent organisation, the mosque association Arab Nil Rhein in Mainz propagated material from the Muslim Brotherhood and salafist ideology. Therefore, the parent association was incompatible with the constitution of Germany. This was the first time authorities closed any preschool in Rhineland-Palatinate (German: &quot;Rheinland-Pfalz&quot;). &quot;A-Nur-Kita&quot; was the first and only Muslim preschool in Rhineland-Palatinate.

===Mosques===
There are now 18 official mosques in the country that have been established as mosques since time immemorial. Muslim places of worship (such as mosques and other places of worship) are estimated at between 1,000 and 1,200. Most of these mosques are temporarily built and are mostly located in rented places, factories or warehouses. According to the archives of the Central Institute of Islam, the most important mosques in Germany are located in cities such as Hamburg, Berlin, Mannheim, Marl, Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, Wesling, Bonn, Zingen, Fortsheim, as well as mosques. The cities of Aachen and Munich are important mosques in Germany. These mosques are far from the city center and are often located in industrial areas.

In 2010, the German Ministry of Education and Research established Islamic Theological Studies as an academic discipline at public universities in order to train teachers for Islamic religious education and Muslim theologians. Since then, Islamic theological departments have been established at several universities, conducting research and teaching on Islam from a theological perspective.

==Controversies==
===Islamophobia===

At the Alternative for Germany party congress held on 30 April to 1 May 2016, AfD adopted a policy platform based upon opposition to Islam, calling for the ban of Islamic symbols including burqas, minarets, and &quot;adhan&quot; (call to prayer), using the slogan &quot;Islam is not a part of Germany&quot;.

===Islamophobia in the education system===

One issue concerns the wearing of the head-scarf by teachers in schools and universities. The right to practice one&#x27;s religion, stated by the teachers in question, contradicts in the view of many the neutral stance of the state towards religion. As of 2006, many of the German federal states have introduced legislation banning head-scarves for teachers. However, such a ban in North-Rhine Westphalia was declared as unconstitutional in 2015 by the Federal Constitutional Court.

In most German federal states, except Bremen, Berlin, and Brandenburg, religious education is offered as an elective subject in state schools. There are discussions about introducing Islamic religious education alongside existing Catholic, Protestant, and, in some schools, Jewish education. Trials for Islamic religious education are underway in several states, and it is already a regular class in Hessen, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia. However, cooperation with Islamic organizations is challenging since no single organization represents the entire Muslim community. The discussion of religious (Islamic) education in German schools started in the 1970s, and also symmetrically with issues of Qur&#x27;anic classes as well as its deterrent effects on the integration of Turkish students into the country.

The construction of mosques is occasionally subjected to Islamophobic reactions in the neighborhoods. For example, in 2007 an attempt by Muslims to build a large mosque in Cologne sparked a controversy.

In recent years, Mosques in Germany have been receiving larger quantities of hate mail as well as threats.

===Islamic fundamentalism and Salafism===

According to a 2007 Federal Ministry of the Interior report, almost half of all young Muslims in Germany express fundamentalist views. Approximately 12% of Muslims in Germany support moral-religious criticism of certain Western societal values, along with a range of views on punishments, including corporal punishment and, in some cases, the Capital punishment.

A 2012 poll found that 72% of Turks in Germany see Islam as the only true religion, while 46% expressed a preference for a growing Muslim population in the future. A University of Bielefeld survey revealed that only 19% of Germans believe Islam is compatible with their culture. 

A 2013 study by the Social Science Research Center Berlin found that two-thirds of Muslims prioritize religious rules over national laws, nearly 60% reject homosexual friends, 45% distrust Jews, and many believe the West aims to destroy Islam. For comparison, among Christians, 9% are openly anti-Semitic, 13% reject homosexual friends, and 23% think Muslims aim to destroy Western culture. Additionally, 25% of Turks in Germany consider atheists inferior.

Salafism, a part of Sunni branch of Islam, according to German authorities, Salafism is incompatible with the principles codified in the Constitution of Germany. According to the German security service, the Salafist movement has grown from 3,800 members in 2011 to 10,300 in September 2017. Security chief Hans-Georg Maaßen noted that the movement lacks a single leader, requiring many individuals to be monitored. In 2016, the interior ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia reported that the number of mosques with a Salafist influence had risen from 30 to 55, which indicated both an actual increase and improved reporting. In February 2017, German authorities banned the Berliner Fussilet-Moscheeverein, which Anis Amri, the 2016 Berlin truck attack, reportedly visited. In March 2017, the &quot;Deutschsprachige Islamkreis Hildesheim&quot; was also banned for planning to join ISIS in Syria. The Federal Agency for Civic Education noted that these bans illustrate how Salafist mosques can be involved in planning terrorism.

In 2016, the German security service estimated that around 24,000 Muslims were involved in Islamist movements, with 10,000 linked to the Salafist scene. That same year, 90 mosques were monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution for promoting Islamist ideologies. Between 2017 and April 2018, 80 Islamist extremists without German citizenship were deported. By March 2018, 760 Islamists in Germany were classified as dangerous by police, with more than half residing in the country, including 153 in prison.

In July 2010, Germany banned the Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V. (IHH Germany), accusing it of using donations to fund Hamas, which is considered by Germany to be a terrorist organization. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere stated that donations to IHH, presented as humanitarian aid, actually supported Hamas. Authorities believed IHH collected funds and sent $8.3 million to Hamas-linked organizations.

=== Antisemitism ===

A 2012 poll indicated that 18% of Turks in Germany viewed Jews as inferior. A 2017 Bielefeld University study reported that antisemitic harassment and assaults in Germany were perpetrated equally by individuals from the extreme right and left, with a significant portion also committed by Muslims. According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the majority of Islamist organizations in Germany cultivate antisemitic propaganda and distribute it in various ways. However, according to German police statistics, more than 90 percent of antisemitic incidents along with Islamophobic ones are perpetrated by individuals associated with the far right.

== Religiosity of young Muslims ==
Studies show that while not all Muslims are religious, Muslim youths are markedly more religious than non-Muslim youths. A study comparing Turkish Muslim youths living in Germany and German youth found that the former were more likely to attend religious services regularly (35% versus 14%).

41% of young Turkish Muslim boys and 52% of the girls said they prayed &quot;sometimes or regularly&quot;; 64% of boys and 74% of girls said they wanted to teach their children religion.

<text>Johann Jakob von Kaup (10 April 1803 – 4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Kaup is also known for having coined popular prehistoric taxa like &quot;Pterosauria&quot;, &quot;Machairodus&quot;, &quot;Deinotherium&quot;, &quot;Dorcatherium&quot;, and &quot;Chalicotherium&quot;.
==Biography==
He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published &quot;Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt&quot;, in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his &quot;Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere&quot; (1855–1862). He also wrote &quot;Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel&quot; (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, &quot;Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias&quot; (1842–1844). He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

He died at Darmstadt.

==Mastodon fossil==
A particularly important incident in the history of paleontology involves Kaup. In 1854 he bought the American mastodon found in 1799 in Orange County, New York. This is the mastodon immortalized in Charles Willson Peale&#x27;s painting of the 1801 excavation (painting executed between 1806 and 1808). This mastodon was on display for many years in Peale&#x27;s Philadelphia Museum and is currently on display in Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt, Germany This mastodon is the first complete example found in the United States, and may be only the second fossil animal ever mounted for display.

== Taxon described by him ==
*See :Category:Taxa named by Johann Jakob Kaup

== Taxon named in his honor ==
*Kaupichthys is a genus of eels of the family Chlopsidae that was named after him.
*Physiculus kaupi is a bathydemersal fish found in the Western Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="533722" wikidata="Q1771067" url="?curid=533722" title="Muthuswami Dikshitar">
<text>Muthuswami Dikshitar (Mudduswamy Dikshitar) (, 24 March 1776 – 21 October 1835), mononymously Dikshitar, was a South Indian poet, singer and veena player, and a composer of Indian classical music, who is considered one of the musical trinity of Carnatic music. Muthuswami Dikshitar was born on 24 March 1776 in Tiruvarur near Thanjavur, in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu in India, to a family that is traditionally traced back to Virinichipuram in the northern boundaries of the state. 

His compositions, of which around 500 are known and are noted for their elaborate, poetic descriptions of Hindu gods / temples and for capturing the essence of the raga forms through the vainika (veena) style that emphasises gamakas. They are in a slower speed (chowka kala). He is also known by his signature name of Guruguha which is also his mudra (and can be found in each of his songs). His compositions are sung and played in classical concerts of Carnatic music.

The musical trinity consists of Dikshitar, Tyagaraja (1767–1847), and Syama Sastri (1762–1827). However, unlike the Telugu compositions of the others, his compositions are predominantly in Sanskrit. He also composed some of his kritis in Manipravalam (a combination of the Sanskrit and Tamil languages).

There are two schools of thought regarding the pronunciation of his name. The name is pronounced as &#x27;Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#x27;. Muthuswami is a common Tamil name (Mutu translates to pearl in Tamil, cognate to Mutya in Sanskrit) and is derived from Selvamuthukumaraswamy, a deity of the famed Vaideeswaran temple in Myladuthurai. However, T K Govinda Rao explains in Compositions of Mudduswamy Dikshitar that &quot;the word Muddayya is an epithet of Kumaraswami or Guha. Further, in the original Telugu publication of Sangita Sampradaya Pradarshini (1904) Sri Subbarama Dikshitar mentions his name as Mudduswamy. Also, in the known composition of Dikshitar, &quot;Bhajare re Chitha&quot; in raga Kalyani, the &quot;mudra&quot; or signature of the composer appears in the text as &quot;Guruguha Roopa Muddu Kumara Jananeem&quot;.

==Early life==
Muthuswami Dikshitar was born in a Brahmin family on 24 March, 1776, in Tiruvarur near Thanjavur in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu in India. He was the eldest son of the composer, Ramaswami Dikshitar who instructed in a number of subjects including the vedas, poetry, music, and astronomy. Muthuswami had two brothers, Chinnaswami () and Balaswami (), and a sister, . Muthuswami&#x27;s father, Ramaswami Dikshitar, born circa 1735, from an Auttara Vadama family in Virinchipuram, had moved South due to the politically troubled environment around Kanchipuram and Virinchipuram at that time. Ramaswamy Dikshithar trained in the veena under Venkata Vaidyanatha Dikshitar, who belonged to the lineage of Govinda Dikshitar and Venkatamakhin and this is evident in Muthuswami&#x27;s works which follow the Venkatamakhin raga system.

Muthuswami moved to the town of Manali, near Madras (now Chennai) at the behest of Venkatakrishna Mudaliar, a local zamindar. The Dikshitar brothers accompanied the zamindar to Fort St. George nearby where they were introduced to Western orchestral music and the violin. An ascetic named Chidambaranatha Yogi then took Muthuswami under his wing and away to the city of Benares (now Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh). There he was instructed in music, esoterics, philosophy, and yoga. He was also exposed to Hindustani classical music, particularly the Dhrupad style, which, according to some scholars, would influence his later compositions.
Upon the death of Chidamabaranatha Yogi, Dikshitar returned South from Benares and moved to the town of Tiruttani near Tirupati.

==Career==

According to legend, Murugan, the deity of the temple at Tirutani, placed a piece of sugar candy in Dikshitar&#x27;s mouth and commanded him to sing. This marked the beginning of his career in music and also led to him adopting the mudra, &quot;Guruguha&quot;, one of the many names of Murugan. His first composition was &quot;&quot; in the raga Maya Malavagaula and Adi tala.

The song addressed the Lord (and/or the guru) in the first declension (Vibhakthi) in Sanskrit. Dikshitar later composed kritis in all the eight declensions on the Lord. These are with epithets glorifying Muruga in the ascetic/preceptor form and have few references to the deity in the saguna form, as at Thiruthani.

He then went on a pilgrimage visiting and composing at the temples at Kanchi, Tiruvannamalai, Chidambaram, Tirupathi and Kalahasthi, Srirangam, before returning to Tiruvarur.

Muthuswami Dikshitar attained proficiency over the veena, and the influence of veena playing is evident in his compositions, particularly the gamakas. In his kriti &quot;Balagopala&quot;, he introduces himself as a &quot;&quot;, &quot;a player of the veena&quot;. He experimented with the violin, and among his disciples, Vadivelu of the Thanjavur Quartet, and his brother Balaswami Dikshitar pioneered the use of violin in Carnatic music, now an integral part of most Carnatic ensembles.

On his return to Tiruvarur, he composed on every deity in the Tiruvarur temple complex including Tyagaraja (an amsham of Lord Shiva), the presiding deity, Nilotpalambal, his consort, and the Goddess Kamalambal an independent deity of high tantric significance in the same temple complex. This is when he composed the famous Kamalamba Navavarna kritis, filled with exemplary sahityas on the deities of the Sri Chakra which proved to be the showcase of his compositions. These &quot;navavaranams&quot; were in all the eight declensions of the Sanskrit language and are sung as a highlight of Guruguha Jayanti celebrated every year. He continued to display his prowess by composing the Navagraha Kritis in praise of the nine planets. The sahitya of the songs reflect a profound knowledge of the Mantra and Jyotisha sastras. The Nilotpalamba Kritis is another classic set of compositions which revived dying ragas like Narayanagaula, Purvagaula, and Chayagaula.

==Death and legacy==

Muthuswami Dikshitar died on 21 October 1835 at Ettayapuram. He had no children. A samadhi was erected at Ettayapuram in his memory and attracts musicians and admirers of his art.

Muthuswami Dikshitar&#x27;s brothers Chinnaswami (1778–) and Balaswami Dikshitar (1786–1858) were also noted musicians. Chinnaswami composed some kritis while Balaswami adapted and pioneered the use of the Western violin in Carnatic music. The two of them were primarily vocalists and performed together as a duo singing Muthuswami&#x27;s compositions. Balaswami&#x27;s grandson was the composer and scholar, Subbarama Dikshitar (1839–1906). In his &quot;Sangeeta Sampradaya Pradarshini&quot; (), Subbarama records 229 of Muthuswami Dikshitar&#x27;s kritis.

Dikshitar&#x27;s disciples included a number of artists who carried forward his tradition. They included the Tanjore quartet brothers, Ponnayya Pillai, Vadivelu, Chinnayya and Sivanandam, the mridangam player Tambiyappa, the veena player Venkatarama Ayyar of Avudayarkoil, Tiruvarur Kamalam, Vallalarkoil Ammani, Kornad Ramaswamy, Tirukkadeyur Bharati, Thevvoor Subrahmania Ayyar, and the son of his Shyama Shastri, Subbaraya Shastri.

With the creativity and spiritual value embedded in his compositions, Dikshitar is considered one of the Trinity of Carnatic music alongside his two contemporaries from Tiruvarur, Tyagaraja and Shyama Shastri. The Carnatic musician M Balamuralikrishna had composed a song in his honour in the Raga Sucharitra, &#x27;Cintayāmi Satatam Śrī Mudduswāmi Dīkṣitam&#x27;. Koteeswara Iyer has composed a song in his honour in the Raga Devamanohari, &#x27;Sāmi Dīkṣita&#x27;.

==Compositions==
His total compositions are about 450 to 500, most of which are sung by musicians today in Carnatic music concerts. Most of his compositions are in Sanskrit and in the Krithi form, i.e., poetry set to music. Muthuswami Dikshitar travelled to many holy shrines throughout his life, and composed krithis on the deities and temples he visited. Dikshitar is considered to have composed on the wide range of deities for any composer.

Each of his compositions are well crafted. The compositions are known for the depth and soulfulness of the melody — his visions of some of the ragas are still the final word on their structure. His Sanskrit lyrics are in praise of the temple deity, but Muthuswami introduces the Advaita thought into his songs, resolving the inherent relationship between Advaita philosophy and polytheistic worship. His songs also contain information about the history of the temple, and its background, thus preserving many customs followed in these old shrines. Another feature in his compositions are the proficient rhyming of lines in the lyrics.

Muthuswami also undertook the project of composing in all the 72 Melakartha ragas, (in his Asampurna Mela scheme) thereby providing a musical example for many rare and lost ragas. Also, he was the pioneer in composing samashti charanam krithis (songs in which the main stanza or pallavi is followed by only one stanza, unlike the conventional two). Dikshitar was a master of tala and is the only composer to have kritis in all the seven basic talas of the Carnatic scheme. Dikshitar shows his skill in Sanskrit by composing in all the eight declensions.

Muthuswami Dikshitar composed many kritis in groups. &quot;Vatapi Ganapatim&quot; is regarded his best-known work.

Muthuswami Dikshitar composed one song (Shri Kantimatim Shankara Yuvatim Shri Guruguhajananim Vandeham. Samashti Charanam Hrîmkâra Bîjâkâra vadanâm Hiranya manimaya Shôbhâ Sadanâm) on the Nellaiappar Temple goddess Kanthimathi Amman. This song is considered to be a song set in the rare raga. He is also said to have composed a Rama Ashtapathi along with Upanishad Brahmendral at Kanchipuram. This work has been lost.

At a young age, Dikshitar was also exposed to the music of the Western bands at Fort St. George. At a later stage, Dikshitar composed some forty songs to several (mostly western folk) tunes loosely adopted to ragas such as Shankarabharanam. This corpus is now known as &quot;nottusvara sahitya&quot; (etym. &quot;nottusvara&quot; = &quot;notes&quot; swara). The influence of Celtic and Baroque styles in these compositions is evident (e.g., &quot;Sakthi Sahitha Ganapatim&quot;, to the tune of &quot;voulez-vous dancer&quot;, &quot;Varashiva Balam&quot;). There is an erroneous belief that these were composed at the behest of CP Brown, the Collector of Cuddappah. This is not possible as the two could have never met. Muthuswami Diskhitar had left Madras by 1799. Brown came to Madras only in 1817, learned Telugu in 1820 and moved to Cuddappah the same year.
The Dikshitars Sri-vidyA upAsana and his many navAvaranas

No discussion of the Dikshitar can ignore his Sri-vidyA upAsana and his navAvarana pujA.

Indeed, the navAvarana structure is NOT confined to the kamalAmbA dEvi.

The Sri-vidyA upAsana is also not limited by grammar/vibhakti sets.

It has been found that the navAvarana structure exists for multiple other deities. See details in the references for the navAvarana sets listed/linked below.

In fact, the rAgas chosen are related by their word names to the Cakra and the rAga/Cakra mudra is embedded in direct or indirect form which is another mark of the Dikshitar.

In all cases, the complete set of 9 kritis form the composite navAvarana.

dhyAna and mangala kritis exist for some of the navAvarana sets such as tiruttani guruguha and kamalAmbA.

The tiruttani guruguha navAvarana (with dhyAna and mangala kritis) 

Most importantly, the Dikshitar gives the words “bhupurAdi navAvaranasya” in the very first Cakra kriti in rAga purvi to this important deity of tiruttani kSEtra

The Cakra names are given (note there are 2 separate ways the Cakras are named, each of the 2 sets is shown)

1.     Sri guruguhasya dAsOham  – Cakra 1 purvi trailOkya mOhana - bhu-purA

2.     Sri nAthAdi guruguhO -Cakra 2 mAyAmAlavagaula sarvAshA paripura- SOdaSadala 

3.     mAnasa guruguha - Cakra 3 Anandabhairavi  sarva-samkSObhana-aSta dala padma

9.     guruguhAdanyam – Cakra 9 balahamsa  sarva-Anandamaya -   bindu

9. sadASraye abhayAmbikE                      Cakra 9                Camaram

In tandem with the abhayAmbA navAvarana the Dikshitar propitiates the mayuranAtha (consort of abhayAmbA)  with a special set of 5 kritis.

The five kritis each carries the mudra (embedded signature) of a fundamental element = bhUta

<text>The Judith River Group is a group of geologic formations in western North America dating from the late Cretaceous and noted as a site for the extensive excavation of dinosaur fossils. The formation is named after the Judith River in Montana. The group is also called the Judith River Wedge. It is stratigraphically equivalent with the Belly River Group in Alberta.

It comprises the Judith River Formation in north central Montana, as well as the Foremost, Oldman, and Dinosaur Park formations in Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada. The wedge is exposed discontinuously in river drainages.

Georgia is divided into 159 counties and contains 535 municipalities consisting of cities, towns, consolidated city-counties, and consolidated cities.
There is no legal difference in Georgia between cities and towns. Eight municipalities have merged with their counties to form consolidated city-counties: Athens with Clarke County, Augusta with Richmond County, Columbus with Muscogee County, Cusseta with Chattahoochee County, Georgetown with Quitman County, Macon with Bibb County, Statenville with Echols County, and Webster County unified government with Webster County. Athens and Augusta also have municipalities independent of the consolidated governments and are considered consolidated cities.

The largest municipality by population in Georgia is Atlanta, with 498,715 residents, and the smallest municipality by population is Aldora, with 0 residents, although the actual estimated population is at 103, due to a &quot;0% self-response rate&quot;.

<doc id="533748" wikidata="Q880239" url="?curid=533748" title="John J. Crittenden">
<text>John Jordan Crittenden (September 10, 1787 – July 26, 1863) was an American statesman and politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and twice served as United States Attorney General in the administrations of William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, and Millard Fillmore. He was also the 17th governor of Kentucky and served in the state legislature. Although frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for the U.S. presidency, he never consented to run for the office.

During his early political career, Crittenden served in the Kentucky House of Representatives and was chosen as speaker on several occasions. With the advent of the Second Party System, he allied with the National Republican (later Whig) Party and was a fervent supporter of, and eventually a protege of Henry Clay and opponent of Democrats Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren.

Lame duck president John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828, but senators who supported president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky secretary of state, the state legislature elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but five months after Harrison&#x27;s death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison&#x27;s successor, John Tyler.

He was returned to the Senate in 1842, serving until 1848, when he resigned to run for governor, hoping his election would help Zachary Taylor win Kentucky&#x27;s vote in the 1848 presidential election. Taylor was elected, but Crittenden refused a post in his cabinet, fearing he would be charged with making a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot;, as Clay had been in 1825. Following Taylor&#x27;s death in 1850, Crittenden resigned the governorship and accepted Millard Fillmore&#x27;s appointment as attorney general.

As the Whig Party crumbled in the mid-1850s, Crittenden joined the Know Nothing (or American) Party. After the expiration of his term as attorney general, he was again elected to the U.S. Senate, where he urged compromise on the issue of slavery to prevent the breakup of the United States. As bitter partisanship increased the threat of secession, Crittenden sought out moderates from all parties and formed the Constitutional Union Party, though he refused the party&#x27;s nomination for president in the 1860 election. In December 1860, he authored the Crittenden Compromise, a series of resolutions and constitutional amendments he hoped would avert the Civil War, but Congress would not approve them.

==Early and family life==
Crittenden was born September 10, 1787, near Versailles, Kentucky. He was the second child and first son of Revolutionary War veteran Major John Crittenden and his wife Judith Harris. John and Judith Crittenden had four sons and five daughters, all but one of whom survived infancy. On his father&#x27;s side, he was of Welsh ancestry, while his mother&#x27;s family was French Huguenot. His father had surveyed land in Kentucky with George Rogers Clark, and settled there just after the end of the American Revolution. Two of Crittenden&#x27;s brothers, Thomas and Robert, became lawyers, while the third, Henry, was a farmer.

Crittenden began a college preparatory curriculum at Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. He was then sent to a boarding school in Jessamine County. Among his classmates were Thomas Alexander Marshall and Francis P. Blair. Crittenden became especially close friends with Blair, and later political differences did little to diminish their friendship. After a year at boarding school, Crittenden moved to the Lexington, Kentucky, home of Judge George M. Bibb to study law. He began more advanced studies at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. During his brief tenure there, he studied mathematics and belles-lettres and became friends with Hugh Lawson White. Dissatisfied with the curriculum at Washington College, Crittendon moved to Williamsburg and transferred to the College of William and Mary. He studied law under St. George Tucker and became acquainted with future president John Tyler.

On May 27, 1811, Crittenden married Sarah O. Lee at her home in Versailles. Lee was a cousin of future U.S. President Zachary Taylor and aunt of U.S. Senator Wilkinson Call. They had seven children before Sarah died in mid-September 1824. Among their children were Confederate major general George Crittenden and Union general Thomas Leonidas Crittenden. Their daughter Sallie Lee &quot;Maria&quot; Crittenden was the mother of John C. Watson, a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy during the late 19th century. Their daughter Ann Mary Butler Crittenden Coleman published in 1864, &quot;Life and Letters of John J. Crittenden&quot;, a biography of her father&#x27;s life.

==Career==
Completing his studies in 1806, Crittenden was admitted to the bar the following year. He began his practice in Woodford County, but found central Kentucky already well supplied with able lawyers. Crittenden then moved to Logan County, Kentucky, on the then western frontier and opened his practice in Russellville. At age twenty-two, he moved across the Ohio River to Illinois Territory, and Governor Ninian Edwards appointed him its attorney general. The following year, Edwards also made Crittenden his aide-de-camp.

In addition to his legal practice when he returned to Kentucky, Crittenden also operated plantations and owned enslaved people. In 1830, his household included 12 free white persons and 6enslaved people. In 1850, Crittenden owned 44 enslaved people (11 women above age 16, 7men, 13 boys and 13 girls). In 1860, after distributing some property to his now-adult children, Crittenden owned ten enslaved people, all mulattos (females aged 60, 25, 21, 18 and 16 and males aged 28, 16, 14, 10 and 1).

==Early political career==
Crittenden&#x27;s career as an elected official began in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he represented Logan County from 1811 to 1817. After the 1811 legislative session, he volunteered as an aide to General Samuel Hopkins in an expedition against the Indians. On the outbreak of the War of 1812, Kentucky governor Charles Scott appointed him as an aide-de-camp for the First Kentucky Militia. In 1813, he became an aide-de-camp to Governor Isaac Shelby, serving at the Battle of the Thames in Canada. Following the war, the governor issued him a special commendation for faithfulness in carrying out his orders. He then resumed his law practice in Russellville.

In 1814, Governor Shelby appointed Crittenden to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by his former teacher, George M. Bibb; later, however, Shelby learned that Crittenden was only twenty-seven years old, three years shy of the constitutional age requirement for senators. Hence he returned to his seat in the Kentucky House, where he was elected speaker over John Rowan. He would retain the position from 1815 to 1817.

As speaker, Crittenden presided over a particularly tumultuous time in the legislature. In October 1816, recently elected governor George Madison died. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Gabriel Slaughter. Slaughter immediately made two extremely unpopular appointments, and quickly fell out of favor with many Kentuckians. A group of legislators, led by John C. Breckinridge, pointed out that the Kentucky Constitution provided only that the lieutenant governor would serve as governor until a new gubernatorial election was held and a qualified successor was chosen. Slaughter, they claimed, was only the &quot;acting governor&quot;. The group presented a bill to the House that called for new elections. The bill was defeated, but Crittenden supported it.

Crittenden&#x27;s support of a new election was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D. Hardin, one of Slaughter&#x27;s unpopular nominees, expired in 1817, the Kentucky General Assembly chose Crittenden to fill the vacancy. Though he was the youngest member of the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was also a member of the Committee on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and indemnify persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act. He found state politics more interesting, however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by the birth of his third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.

===Legislative interim===
After leaving Congress, Crittenden moved to Frankfort, the state capital, to attract more legal clients and be nearer to the center of the state&#x27;s political activity. Among his clients after moving to Frankfort were former presidents Madison and Monroe, future vice-president Richard Mentor Johnson, and future governors James T. Morehead, John Breathitt, and Robert P. Letcher. During this period, he collaborated with Henry Clay in defending Charles Wickliffe, son of Robert C. Wickliffe. Wickliffe was charged with the murder of the editor of the &quot;Kentucky Gazette&quot;. Crittenden argued that the slaying was self-defense, and Clay delivered a passionate closing argument. The jury returned a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot; only minutes after the case was submitted to them.

In January 1820, Crittenden and John Rowan were chosen to help resolve Kentucky&#x27;s boundary dispute with Tennessee. The boundary was supposed to run along the line at 36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude, but when Thomas Walker surveyed it, he erroneously marked the line farther north. Crittenden and Rowan proposed either that the &quot;Walker Line&quot; remain the boundary from the Cumberland Mountains to the Tennessee River and Tennessee would compensate for the error west of the Tennessee River, or that the boundary be reset at 36 degrees, 30 minutes throughout. Tennessee&#x27;s commissioners rejected both proposals, asking instead that the Walker Line be accepted east of the Tennessee River and a more southerly line west of it, with reciprocal agreements between the states to honor existing land grants. Crittenden was inclined to accept the offer, but Rowan was not. The Kentucky commissioners proposed that the matter be submitted to arbitration, but Tennessee refused. In a report to the General Assembly, Crittenden recommended that Kentucky accept the Tennessee proposal. The legislators were swayed by Crittenden&#x27;s report, and the articles of agreement were signed on February 2, 1820.

Crittenden was elected to the board of trustees for Transylvania University in 1823, possibly due to lobbying by Henry Clay. A year later, the faculty of the university awarded him an honorary doctor of laws. Crittenden also served as a trustee and attorney for the Kentucky Seminary in Frankfort. Crittenden used his influence in support of Clay in the 1824 presidential election until Clay was eliminated from contention. He then threw his support to Andrew Jackson until he learned that John Quincy Adams, if elected, would likely make Clay Secretary of State. Critics termed Adams&#x27; alleged promise to Clay the &quot;corrupt bargain&quot;, but it resulted in Adams&#x27; election. Upon his appointment as Secretary of State, Clay was prepared to recommend Crittenden to replace him as chief counsel in Kentucky for the Second Bank of the United States, but the bank chose not to hire a replacement.

===Old Court – New Court controversy===

Crittenden was drawn back into public service by the Old Court – New Court controversy. When legislation aimed at providing relief to the state&#x27;s debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly&#x27;s action was unconstitutional, and for a time both courts claimed authority as the court of last resort in the state. Though he had served as president of the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the two seats allotted to Franklin County, a bastion of the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state&#x27;s Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.

In the early hours of the morning of November 7, 1825, the very morning the legislature was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp&#x27;s murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer&#x27;s capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, it became clear that the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp&#x27;s wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.

The court controversy dominated the legislative session. Crittenden joined the Old Court majority in the House in passing a measure to abolish the New Court. The bill was killed in the Senate, however, by the tie-breaking vote of Lieutenant Governor Robert B. McAfee. Crittenden later served on a committee of six to resolve the conflict, but to no avail. He was unwilling to accept a solution whereby all the justices resigned from both courts, and the governor would appoint a reorganized court made up equally of Old Court and New Court supporters. This position cost him the support of some New Court partisans that had voted for him in the previous election, and he was not returned to the House in 1826. Ultimately, Old Court partisans gained control of both houses of the legislature, and the New Court was abolished permanently in December 1826.

On November 15, 1826, Crittenden married Maria Knox Todd, a widow who was the daughter of Judge Harry Innes. Crittenden took Todd&#x27;s three children as his own, and the couple had two more children: John and Eugene. Todd&#x27;s daughter Catherine married her stepbrother, Crittenden&#x27;s son Thomas; their son, John Jordan Crittenden III, was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Maria Knox Todd Crittenden died on September 8, 1851, of an unknown illness.

==Association with the National Republicans==

As a result of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky&#x27;s politicians became divided between the Democrats and the National Republicans. Crittenden&#x27;s alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden&#x27;s support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson&#x27;s financial policies.

Crittenden supporters sought to make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, who went on to carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.

In 1829, Crittenden was elected to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to nominate Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether he would be able to secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for himself because he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden&#x27;s supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.

The following year, a clear majority of the House of Representatives were pledged to Crittenden for the open Senate seat. However, Clay allies pressured Crittenden to step aside and allow Clay to be the Whig nominee. Crittenden obliged, and Clay was elected by a margin of nine votes over Richard M. Johnson. Crittenden went on to manage both the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Richard Aylett Buckner and the campaign to help Clay win Kentucky in the 1832 presidential election. After Clay&#x27;s defeat in 1832, he offered to resign his Senate seat and allow Crittenden to succeed him, but Crittenden refused the offer. Later that year, Crittenden retired from the General Assembly.

==Association with the Whigs==

Crittenden was active in organizing the Whig Party from the remnants of the defunct National Republican Party in 1834. On July 4, 1834, he called to order the party&#x27;s first organizational meeting in the state at Cove Spring on the outskirts of Frankfort. He was chosen as chair of the committee on resolutions and in a speech on July 5, bitterly condemned President Jackson. Later in 1834, Kentucky governor James T. Morehead appointed Crittenden Secretary of State. In the August elections, Whigs won a majority in both houses of the General Assembly. When the Assembly convened, they elected Crittenden to the U.S. Senate over Democrat James Guthrie by a vote of 94–40.

Immediately upon taking his seat in the Senate, Crittenden was named to the Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, probably due to Clay&#x27;s influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton&#x27;s proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch&#x27;s authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.

During his term, Crittenden remained an outspoken critic of Jackson and his successor, Martin Van Buren. He supported Henry Clay&#x27;s plan for distributing proceeds from the sale of public lands among the states, and also joined Clay in opposing the administration-backed Second Seminole War. One of the few administration proposals he supported was the recognition of the new Republic of Texas. During this period of Crittenden&#x27;s service in the Senate, the issue of slavery rose to prominence. Crittenden was regarded as a moderate on the issue, seeking to keep it out of politics altogether. In 1836, he resisted petitions by the Quakers to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., but he also opposed radical pro-slavery measures such as John C. Calhoun&#x27;s proposal to ban abolitionist literature from being delivered by mail in the Southern states.

In contrast to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves that ended in a duel. On the floor of the House, Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor James Watson Webb. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley&#x27;s comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb&#x27;s honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky congressman Richard Menefee and Virginia congressman Richard Wise asked Crittenden to serve as a second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the censure of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.

===Harrison and Tyler administrations===
In the 1840 presidential election, Crittenden again encouraged Kentucky Whigs to support the nomination of Henry Clay. During the balloting at the party&#x27;s 1839 convention, candidates Clay and General Winfield Scott played cards with Crittenden and Whig politician George Evans at the Astor House hotel in New York City. When the group received word of William Henry Harrison&#x27;s victory, Clay blamed his loss on Scott and struck him, with the blow landing on the shoulder which had been wounded during Scott&#x27;s participation in the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Afterwards Clay had to be physically removed from the hotel room. Scott then sent Crittenden to Clay with Scott&#x27;s challenge for a duel, but Crittenden reconciled them by convincing Clay to apologize.

After Clay lost the nomination, Crittenden supported Harrison. Crittenden was re-elected to the Senate in 1840 even though he was widely expected to be named to a position in Harrison&#x27;s cabinet. He was apparently given his choice of positions, and selected Attorney General. He resigned his Senate seat to take this post.

As attorney general, Crittenden issued only one notable opinion. The plaintiff in the case was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson&#x27;s invasion of what would become the Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden&#x27;s opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.

Only a week after being appointed by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York City to mediate tensions with Great Britain over the sinking of the steamboat &quot;Caroline&quot; by a group of Canadian militia, who were attempting to suppress a rebellion in Canada. In this diplomatic endeavor, Crittenden was acting separately from his official duties as attorney general. He spoke with New York governor William H. Seward and secured his promise to pardon Alexander McLeod, who had seized and burned the &quot;Caroline&quot;, if he were convicted of a crime in New York. Ultimately, McLeod was acquitted.

Shortly after the &quot;Caroline&quot; affair, President Harrison died and Vice-president John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler resisted Clay&#x27;s attempts to set the Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden&#x27;s advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler&#x27;s cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler&#x27;s deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden&#x27;s resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it to him as a gift on his return to Kentucky.

Crittenden was appointed to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay&#x27;s resignation. In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over Richard Mentor Johnson. The Whigs&#x27; feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even talked of impeaching him, but Crittenden condemned that course of action. During the 27th and 28th Congresses, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs. He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal internal improvements. He opposed giving states the option to forgo apportionment, which would have allowed them to elect their congressmen at-large.

===Polk administration===

Crittenden again supported Clay&#x27;s presidential bid in 1844. Clay was widely considered the favorite not only for the Whig nomination, but to win the general election. None of the traditional campaign issues—Tyler&#x27;s &quot;executive usurpation&quot;, Clay&#x27;s &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; with John Quincy Adams, or the protective tariff—seemed to excite the electorate. However, the issue of the annexation of Texas changed the entire campaign. Clay made a tour of the South just before the Whig nominating convention and concluded that the sentiment in favor of annexation in that part of the country was not as strong as had been assumed in Washington, D.C. Acting on this belief, and against Crittenden&#x27;s advice, Clay sent a letter opposing annexation to Crittenden, asking him to have it published in the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot;.

Clay believed the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, and this would keep annexation from becoming an issue in the campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party&#x27;s nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of both sides of the issue as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay&#x27;s defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.

In 1845, the Senate took up the question of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended in order to allow time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden&#x27;s position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations&#x27; claims at the 49th parallel north.

In 1846, the United States entered the Mexican–American War in an attempt to gain control of Texas. Crittenden did not support the war, and after war was declared, he insisted that commissioners accompany the U.S. armies and attempt to broker peace at every opportunity. Throughout the war, he corresponded regularly with Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Crittenden&#x27;s sons, George and Thomas, both served in the war; Thomas Crittenden served on Scott&#x27;s staff. President Polk consulted Crittenden regarding the terms of peace that should be accepted to end the war. Crittenden insisted that the terms of peace should not include the acquisition of territory to which the United States did not have a &quot;just claim&quot;, but the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo submitted to Congress in 1848 called for Mexico to give up its claims not only to Texas, but also to New Mexico, California, and all the territory in between. A few Whigs joined the Democratic majority in Congress to ratify the treaty and defeat the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in the newly acquired territory.

Friends encouraged Crittenden to run for president in the 1848 election. A Nashville newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from Rhode Island opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. George B. Kinkead desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. &quot;For Heaven&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t talk to me about the Presidency&quot;, he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay lay on his deathbed.

===Campaigns of 1848===

The Whig Party was also divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of politics since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden&#x27;s name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden&#x27;s friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden&#x27;s position in the Senate. He would also have to abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that grew out of the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky&#x27;s electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.

Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was the leading candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd also declined the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay did not intend to seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs&#x27; choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.

With his own campaign at a close, Crittenden resumed direction of Taylor&#x27;s presidential campaign, dispatching accomplished Whig speakers to all parts of the country. After Taylor was elected, he offered Crittenden the post of Secretary of State. Appeals came in from both Whig and Democratic leaders across the country urging him to serve in the cabinet; Taylor was inexperienced, and many felt that without Crittenden to guide him, his administration would fail. Taylor personally visited Crittenden in Frankfort on February 15, 1849, in hopes of persuading him to accept the appointment. Crittenden refused Taylor&#x27;s overtures, and Taylor similarly rejected Crittenden&#x27;s appeals to appoint his friend, Robert P. Letcher, as Postmaster General. Crittenden&#x27;s input is believed to have contributed significantly to the appointments of John M. Clayton as Secretary of State and Orlando Brown as Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

Crittenden&#x27;s reasons for refusing Taylor&#x27;s appointment were many. Partially, he declined out of respect for Clay&#x27;s feelings and partially he felt it would be viewed in the same way as Clay and Adams&#x27; &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; in 1825. Resigning the governorship also would have amounted to admitting to the Democrats&#x27; charges that he only sought the office to help Taylor win the presidency. Finally, he had not been able to fully heal the breach in the Whig Party, and he wanted to remedy that situation.

===Gubernatorial administration===
During Crittenden&#x27;s term, he gave strong support to superintendent of public education, Robert Jefferson Breckinridge, who would come to be known as the &quot;Father of public school system in Kentucky.&quot; In response to Crittenden&#x27;s call for financial support for the improvement of public education, the General Assembly passed a common school law on February 26, 1849. This law established guidelines for several public officials regarding their administration of the common schools. The Assembly also reserved tolls collected on the Kentucky, Green, and Barren rivers for education, and passed a two percent property tax to fund the state&#x27;s schools.

Crittenden ordered the refurbishing of the state penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised the creation of a sinking fund to retire the state&#x27;s debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden&#x27;s term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state&#x27;s legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.

With the question of slavery becoming even more critical following the territorial acquisitions of the Mexican–American War, John C. Calhoun delivered an inflammatory address in December 1848 urging leaders of the southern states to resist &quot;Northern aggression&quot;, even if it meant secession from the Union. Crittenden strongly denounced secession in his annual messages to the legislature in 1848 and 1849. In response, the state senate passed a resolution calling on Kentucky&#x27;s citizens to cherish the Union and resist any efforts to secede.

===Second term as attorney general===

Vice President Millard Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon Taylor&#x27;s death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in the Compromise of 1850. Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden&#x27;s opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.

Questions regarding claims in Florida, some already considered by Crittenden during his first term as attorney general, continued during his second term. Specifically, some of the claimants objected to a legal provision, passed by Congress years after the Adams–Onís Treaty, that allowed the secretary of the treasury to refuse to pay claims awarded by Florida courts that he found not to be &quot;just and equitable&quot;. The claimants contended that this allowed an executive officer to overrule a judicial decision in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. Crittenden held that the secretary&#x27;s ruling was just as much a judicial action as that of the Florida judges. Further, he reiterated his 1841 decision that no interest could be paid on claims arising from damages resulting from Jackson&#x27;s invasion. Despite this opinion, a Florida judge awarded interest to one of the claimants, and the government appealed the case to the Supreme Court, with Crittenden serving as the government&#x27;s counsel. The Court upheld Crittenden&#x27;s entire opinion in its ruling.

Crittenden was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard University in 1851. Later that year, he acted as Secretary of State during the illness of Daniel Webster. In this capacity, he wrote a vigorous warning to both Britain and France about interfering in the question of Cuban independence. He also encouraged adherence to the United States&#x27; traditional policy of non-interference in Europe during the celebrated visit of Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth to the United States in 1851.

In November 1851, the General Assembly convened to elect a successor to Senator Joseph R. Underwood. Underwood, whose term would expire in 1853, desired re-election, and Whigs Charles S. Morehead and George Robertson had also announced their respective candidacies. Crittenden, whose term as attorney general also expired in 1853, had publicly announced that he wished to return to the Senate after his service in President Fillmore&#x27;s cabinet, and upon learning this, Underwood and Morehead both withdrew from the race. Robertson was not expected to seriously challenge Crittenden, but following the withdrawals of the other candidates, Archibald Dixon entered the race. Historically an ally of Crittenden, Dixon&#x27;s entrance into the race after Crittenden&#x27;s announcement showed that he had switched his allegiance from Crittenden to Clay. Democrats, desirous to defeat Crittenden and embarrass the Whigs, pledged to vote against him at all costs, even if it meant electing Dixon. Crittenden&#x27;s friends, therefore, held back his name from nomination to spare him almost certain defeat. Balloting deadlocked for several days, with Clay supporters throwing their support to Dixon, Robertson, and Lieutenant Governor John B. Thompson, a compromise candidate. Another compromise was proposed whereby Clay, his health failing, would resign his Senate seat, creating two Senate vacancies and allowing both Dixon and Crittenden to be elected, but Clay refused to cooperate. Finally, on the night of December 11, 1851, the Whigs met in caucus and agreed to withdraw both Dixon and Crittenden and elect Thompson.

A week after the election, Clay resigned, but Crittenden now declined the appointment to fill his unexpired term. Instead, the legislature elected Dixon to the remainder of Clay&#x27;s term, set to expire in March 1855. Three weeks before Clay&#x27;s death in 1852, he sent for Crittenden, and the two were reconciled; Crittenden delivered a eulogy for Clay in September 1852, publicly dispelling the feud. After Clay&#x27;s death, Crittenden became the most prominent Whig leader in Kentucky. He encouraged the party to support the nomination of Millard Fillmore for the presidency in 1852, but the nomination ultimately went to Winfield Scott. Crittenden was proposed as the nominee for vice-president, but he declined. Democrats captured the governorship that year; this was harbinger of the demise of the Whig Party in Kentucky.

===Return to the Senate===

On February 27, 1853, the twice-widowed Crittenden married his third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was also twice-widowed, most recently to General William Henry Ashley. Moss was Crittenden&#x27;s wife until his death. Crittenden served as attorney general until the expiration of Fillmore&#x27;s term in 1853. Following his service as attorney general, he returned to private life. He made a substantial amount of money establishing mining claims for his clients in the former Mexican territory.

In 1853, the legislature was to elect a successor to Senator Dixon. Now satisfied that the feud between Clay and Crittenden had ended, Dixon did not seek re-election, leaving Crittenden with no Whig opposition. On a joint vote of the two houses of the General Assembly, Crittenden was elected 78–59 over governor Lazarus Powell.

In the period between his election and his taking office, Crittenden was the lead defense counsel in the murder trial of Matt F. Ward, the son of one of Crittenden&#x27;s lifelong friends. Ward&#x27;s younger brother had been disciplined by the principal at Louisville Male High School the preceding November, and the elder Ward went to argue with the principal on behalf of his brother. In the ensuing encounter, Ward shot and killed the principal with a pistol. Public sentiment was heavily against Ward, and the trial was moved to Hardin County. During the week-long trial, which began in April 1854, Crittenden emphasized inconsistencies in the accounts of eyewitnesses and called prominent character witnesses such as Louisville mayor James Stephens Speed, Congressman William Preston, and &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; editor George D. Prentice. He presented a case that Ward had acted in self-defense. Because the prosecution sought the death penalty, Crittenden asserted that if the jury rendered an erroneous conviction, they would have no peace of mind knowing they had sentenced an innocent man to hang.

There was a tremendous public outcry when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden for his role in securing it. Only Prentice, in the &quot;Courier-Journal&quot;, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden&#x27;s resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were burned in effigy.

When he assumed his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest member of that body. The Whig Party had practically dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he did not agree with all the party&#x27;s principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party&#x27;s candidate in the 1856 presidential election.

Crittenden was present on May 22, 1856, when Congressman Preston Brooks attacked Senator Charles Sumner with a cane on the floor of the Senate. During the attack, Brooks&#x27;s allies from the House, Laurence M. Keitt and Henry A. Edmundson, prevented witnesses from coming to Sumner&#x27;s aid. Crittenden attempted to intervene, and pleaded with Brooks not to kill Sumner. Senator Robert Toombs then had to intercede for Crittenden, telling Keitt that it would be wrong to attack someone who was not a party to the Brooks-Sumner dispute, though Toombs also indicated later that he had no issue with Brooks beating Sumner, and in fact approved of it.

In the early part of his term, Crittenden was concerned with quelling the violence in Kansas Territory. An opponent of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, Crittenden also opposed repealing the Missouri Compromise unless the North agreed to substitute popular sovereignty for the exclusion of slavery north of the 36°30&#x27; line. In early 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the Kansas Territory to ensure that fair elections were held there, but the proposal was blocked by the Pierce administration. He did not agree with all of the act proposed by Toombs to allow for a constitutional convention in Kansas Territory, but he supported it as a step to bring peace there. He regarded the ratifications of both the Topeka Constitution and the Lecompton Constitution as invalid, and made one of the most highly regarded speeches of his career in opposition to the latter. His substitute bill that would have resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another ratification vote was supported by Republicans, but it was ultimately defeated. So great was Crittenden&#x27;s influence after his actions on the Kansas question that Abraham Lincoln felt that Crittenden&#x27;s endorsement of Stephen Douglas cost Lincoln the Illinois senatorial election in 1858.

==Civil War==

From 1858 to 1860, Crittenden sought out moderates from all sections of the country to effect compromise on the territorial and slavery issues, thus averting war. In 1860, he was named chair of the National Union Executive Committee, a group of congressmen and journalists who feared that sectional differences would destroy the Union. His efforts helped form the Constitutional Union Party later that year. Chosen as the keynote speaker at the party&#x27;s national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to become their nominee for president. At age seventy-three, however, Crittenden was already contemplating retirement and instead orchestrated the nomination of John Bell, whom he actively supported in the 1860 presidential race.

Even after the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued to work for the preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which would be much more difficult to change. To that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The amendments would have restored the Missouri Compromise line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden&#x27;s other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the amendments denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths Compromise perpetual in duration.

The compromise proposal was referred to a special committee proposed by Crittenden&#x27;s fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though it was believed that Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden&#x27;s compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden&#x27;s plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden&#x27;s plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina&#x27;s lead and passed ordinances of secession.

On January 3, 1861, Crittenden tried to salvage his plan by recommending to the full Senate that it be submitted to the people in referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden&#x27;s plan, and Republicans in Congress used a variety of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved to substitute for Crittenden&#x27;s plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark&#x27;s substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden&#x27;s proposal.

Crittenden remained in Washington for a few weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabamian serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state&#x27;s secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, and by the time he definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden&#x27;s nomination.

Having failed to secure compromise at the federal level, Crittenden returned to Kentucky in early 1861, attempting to persuade his home state to reject the overtures of fellow southern states and remain in the Union. On May 10, 1861, a conference was held to decide Kentucky&#x27;s course in the war. Crittenden joined Archibald Dixon and S. S. Nicholas as Unionist representatives at the conference; the Southern Rights position was represented by John C. Breckinridge, Governor Beriah Magoffin, and Richard Hawes. The conference failed to produce a united course of action, but adopted the policy of armed neutrality. Unionists in the legislature, however, feared that the state militia and its commander Simon Bolivar Buckner, had Confederate sympathies. To counter any threat that the militia would seize control of the state for the South, the General Assembly organized the Home Guard, a separate militia controlled by a five-man, pro-Union commission. Crittenden enlisted in the Home Guard as a private and was part of a group styled the &quot;Union Defense Committee&quot; that secured weapons for the Home Guard from the federal government.

In April, the General Assembly called a border states convention to be held in Frankfort in May. Slates of delegates were nominated by both the Unionists and the Southern Rightists, but war broke out before the election of delegates; the Southern Rights delegates withdrew from the election, and the Unionist slate, including Crittenden, was chosen by default. On May 27, 1861, Crittenden was chosen chair of the convention and called it to order. With war having largely precluded any good the meeting could have accomplished, only nine of Kentucky&#x27;s twelve delegates were present, along with four from Missouri (out of seven elected), and one from Tennessee (and his election was questionable); Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware sent no delegates. Ultimately, the convention accomplished little beyond calling on the southern states to reconsider their secession and on the northern states to moderate their demands.

Against his father&#x27;s wishes, Crittenden&#x27;s son George resigned his position as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army to join the Confederate States Army (in which he was promoted to brigadier and then to major general), only to effectively lose his career in the early Confederate defeat at Mill Springs, Kentucky. George&#x27;s brother, Thomas Leonidas Crittenden, had been a member of Buckner&#x27;s State Guard, but joined the Union Army in September 1861 and was advanced to the rank of brigadier general, serving under Don Carlos Buell. Another son, Eugene, also served in the Union Army and attained the rank of colonel. One of John Crittenden&#x27;s grandsons, John Crittenden Coleman, enlisted with the Confederate Army, while another grandson, John Crittenden Watson, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and participated in Union Rear Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s capture of New Orleans during the war.

===Service in the House of Representatives and death===
President Lincoln called a special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special elections in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate, but he finally consented to run in late May. He was elected over secessionist candidate William E. Simms; in all, nine of Kentucky&#x27;s ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election. Upon taking his seat, he was assigned to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On July 10, 1861, he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky&#x27;s neutrality; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions. In order to calm the fears of border state citizens concerned about the Union&#x27;s objectives in the war, he introduced the Crittenden–Johnson Resolution, which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated that the object of the war was not the subjugation of those states, but the defense of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union. When those ends were achieved, the resolution stated, the war should cease. Kentucky Representative Henry C. Burnett asked that the question be divided. Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from Wisconsin&#x27;s John F. Potter and Ohio&#x27;s Albert G. Riddle. In the Senate, the resolution passed 30–5, with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority. In December 1861 the House refused, by a vote of 76–65, to reaffirm the resolution.

After Congress adjourned in late July 1861, Crittenden returned home to Frankfort, but presently had to flee the city as Confederate generals Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith invaded Kentucky, capturing both Frankfort and Lexington. He took up temporary residence at Louisville&#x27;s Galt House hotel and was still residing there when Union General William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson was killed by Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis there in 1862. He returned to his home in Frankfort shortly after the Battle of Perryville drove the Confederates from the state on October 8, 1862. Returning for the regular congressional session, he became the conduit through which many reports of unconstitutional military arrests in Kentucky were channeled. He spoke against the admission of West Virginia to the Union on the grounds that Virginia had not consented to the creation of the state from its territory. He also opposed the Emancipation Proclamation and the use of slaves as soldiers in the war.

When he returned to Kentucky following the 37th Congress, Crittenden&#x27;s health was failing, and he frequently complained of shortness of breath and chest pain. He had determined to retire from Congress, but once again, friends persuaded him to stand for re-election. Shortly after his nomination, Crittenden and his wife were &quot;en route&quot; to an alum spring in Indiana to seek treatment to alleviate the symptoms of his failing health when he collapsed in Louisville. After remaining bedfast at the home of a local doctor, he returned home to Frankfort, where he died on July 26, 1863. He was interred at the State Cemetery in Frankfort. Among his other notable kinsmen were nephews Thomas Theodore Crittenden, congressman from Missouri, and Thomas Turpin Crittenden, a general in the Union Army.

==Legacy and honors==
*In Kentucky, Crittenden County and the town of Crittenden are named for him.
*The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.
*Camp Floyd in Utah was renamed Fort Crittenden in his honor.

==Notes==
* Available sources leave some uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the exact timeline of Crittenden&#x27;s education. All seem to agree on his graduation from William and Mary in 1806 and admission to the bar in 1807. Sources disagree on matriculation and graduation dates, as well as Crittenden&#x27;s age and the duration of his studies at the other institutions.

<doc id="533750" wikidata="Q3587154" url="?curid=533750" title="1999 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 8 and 15 May 1999. They were the first election held under the revised Constitution of 1997, which instituted a new electoral system and resulted in Mahendra Chaudhry taking office as Fiji&#x27;s first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, following a landslide victory for the Fiji Labour Party. It was also a wipeout loss for the incumbent Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) government of Sitiveni Rabuka, which lost all but eight seats and won less seats than the Fijian Association Party (FAP).

==Opinion polls==
==Results==
Mahendra Chaudhry&#x27;s Fiji Labour Party won all 19 Indo-Fijian seats, annihilating the National Federation Party which had traditionally been Fiji&#x27;s dominant Indo-Fijian party; Indo-Fijian voters were angered by the NFP&#x27;s decision to enter into an electoral coalition agreement with the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, whom they had not forgiven for leading the military coup that removed an Indo-Fijian dominated government from power in 1987. In addition to the 19 Indo-Fijian seats, the Labour Party won 18 of the 25 &quot;open electorates&quot; for a total of 37 - an absolute majority in the 71-member House. 

The Fijian Association Party, led by Adi Kuini Speed (the widow of former Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra), won 11 seats (10 ethnic Fijian and 1 open) against only 8 seats (5 ethnic Fijian and 3 open) for the Fijian Political Party, which had ruled the country since 1992. The Christian Democratic Alliance won 3 seats (2 ethnic Fijian and one open), while Apisai Tora&#x27;s Party of National Unity won four ethnic Fijian seats. The United General Party won one &quot;general&quot; and one open electorate. The remaining six seats (two ethnic Fijian, two &quot;general electorates,&quot; one Rotuman, and one open) were won by minor parties and independents.

==Aftermath==
Many ethnic Fijians were unwilling to accept the result of the election, which was partly because their own votes had been so fragmented while those of Indo-Fijians had been much more united. President and &quot;father of the nation&quot; Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara worked behind the scenes, however, to persuade the main ethnic Fijian parties in parliament to accept Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry as Prime Minister. To appease ethnic Fijians, Chaudhry gave 11 of the 18 Cabinet posts to native Fijian politicians. Following the power-sharing provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet was composed of members of numerous political parties.

Not all ethnic Fijians were appeased, however. Simmering resentment exploded on 19 May 2000, when George Speight stormed the parliament buildings and kidnapped most members of the government, including Chaudhry in a coup.

<text>Night Shift is a 1982 American comedy film directed by Ron Howard. The film centers on a timid night-shift morgue employee whose life is turned upside down by a new co-worker who fancies himself a free-spirited entrepreneur. It stars Henry Winkler along with Michael Keaton, in his first starring role, and Shelley Long. Also appearing are Richard Belzer and Clint Howard. There are brief scenes with a young Kevin Costner as &quot;frat boy #1&quot;, Shannen Doherty as a Bluebird scout, Vincent Schiavelli as a man who delivers a sandwich, and Charles Fleischer as one of the jail prisoners.

The film was a critical and financial success. Winkler, who had previously worked with Ron Howard on the hit television show &quot;Happy Days&quot;, was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, while Keaton won the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Plot==
Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Lumley, formerly a successful stockbroker, has found a refuge from the ulcer-inducing Wall Street rat race in his job as an attendant at a New York City morgue. His displeasure at being &quot;promoted&quot; to night-shift supervisor to make room for his boss&#x27; nephew, Leonard, is exacerbated by the irrational exuberance of Bill &quot;Blaze&quot; Blazejowski, his new co-worker. They are inspired by the plight of Chuck&#x27;s prostitute neighbor, Belinda, to apply Chuck&#x27;s financial acumen and Bill&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit to open a prostitution service headquartered at the morgue.

Chuck falls in love with Belinda, but their relationship becomes complicated when Belinda refuses to quit prostitution. Chuck&#x27;s passiveness keeps him from telling Belinda he loves her. Meanwhile, Chuck and Bill&#x27;s foray into the prostitution business draws the ire of dangerous pimps who come to the morgue and threaten to kill Chuck. Bill inadvertently leads two undercover police officers to the morgue where Chuck is being assaulted by the pimps. A shootout ensues. Chuck and Bill are rescued, but are arrested for promoting prostitution. Because their arrest would be a political embarrassment, the two men are offered their old jobs back and a dismissal of all charges. Chuck accepts this, but Bill sees it as an opportunity to bargain with the mayor&#x27;s office. Chuck and Bill fight and part ways. Chuck&#x27;s fiancée Charlotte ends their engagement.

Chuck sees Belinda in the hall of their apartment complex, but again fails to express his true feelings for her. Belinda leaves, and Chuck becomes angry with himself for being afraid. With renewed determination, Chuck finds Belinda working in an adult club and professes his love for her. He also finds Bill is employed there, apologizes for his harsh words, and assures Bill of the value of his creative ideas. The three leave the club together and go out on the town.

It gained popularity a few years later when covered by Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight, and Stevie Wonder.

The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Night Shift&quot; bristles with pitch-perfect laughs thanks to Ron Howard&#x27;s snappy direction and a side-splitting turn from Michael Keaton.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Many reviewers praised the performances of the two male leads, particularly Michael Keaton.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; Movie Guide wrote that &quot;Winkler turns in the best performance of his career, and Keaton is wonderful.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum compared &quot;Night Shift&quot; to the subsequent comedy film &quot;Risky Business&quot; (which also dealt with the theme of prostitution), noting that &quot;Night Shift&quot; is not &quot;as snappily directed or as caustically conceived, ... but it&#x27;s arguably just as sexy and almost as funny.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, deemed &quot;Night Shift&quot; &quot;a halfway funny movie, one that&#x27;s got loads of good gags in its first half and nothing but trouble in its second.&quot; Gene Siskel, writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, gave the film two stars out of four but hailed Keaton&#x27;s &quot;superb comic performance&quot;, writing that &quot;based on this one role, I would now pay to see Keaton in just about anything. Anything except &quot;Night Shift.&quot;&quot;
