<text>The fisher (Pekania pennanti) is a carnivorous mammal native to North America, a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States. It is a member of the mustelid family, and is the only living member of the genus &quot;Pekania&quot;. It is sometimes referred to as a fisher cat, although it is not a cat.

The fisher is closely related to, but larger than, the American marten (&quot;Martes americana&quot;) and Pacific marten (&quot;Martes caurina&quot;). In some regions, the fisher is known as a &quot;pekan&quot;, derived from its name in the Abenaki language, or &quot;wejack&quot;, an Algonquian word (cf. Cree , Ojibwa ) borrowed by fur traders. Other Native American names for the fisher are Chipewyan and Carrier , both meaning &quot;big marten&quot;, and Wabanaki &quot;uskool&quot;.

Fishers have few predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand that they became locally extinct in several parts of the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Conservation and protection measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historical limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.

Male and female fishers look similar, but can be differentiated by size; males being up to twice as large as the females. The fur of the fisher varies seasonally, being denser and glossier in the winter. During the summer, the color becomes more mottled, as the fur goes through a moulting cycle. The fisher prefers to hunt in the full forest. Although an agile climber, it spends most of its time on the forest floor, where it prefers to forage around fallen trees. An omnivore, it feeds on a wide variety of small animals and occasionally on fruits and mushrooms. It prefers the snowshoe hare and is one of the few animals able to prey successfully on porcupines. Despite its common name, it rarely eats fish. The reproductive cycle lasts almost a year. Female fishers give birth to a litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for them until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.

== Etymology ==
Despite the name &quot;fisher&quot;, the animal is not known to eat fish. The name is instead related to the word &quot;fitch&quot;, meaning a European polecat (&quot;Mustela putorius&quot;) or pelt thereof, due to the resemblance to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent or . In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called or . Alternatively, Dr. James DeKay, as reported by John James Audubon and John Bachman, claimed the name &quot;fisher&quot; may have been attributed to the animal&#x27;s &quot;singular fondness for the fish used to bait traps&quot;, although this may have been local lore.

== Taxonomy ==

The Latin specific name &quot;pennanti&quot; honors Thomas Pennant, who described the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a &quot;pekan&quot;. Pennant examined the same specimen, but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon&#x27;s earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it &quot;Mustela canadensis&quot;, and Boddaert, who named it &quot;Mustela melanorhyncha&quot;. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus &quot;Martes&quot; by Smith in 1843. In 2008, advances in DNA analysis allowed a more detailed study of the fisher&#x27;s evolutionary history. The fisher and the genus &quot;Martes&quot; were determined to have descended from a common ancestor, but the fisher was distinct enough to put it in its own genus. It was decided to create the genus &quot;Pekania&quot; and reclassify the fisher as &quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;.

Members of the genus &quot;Pekania&quot; are distinguished by their four premolar teeth on the upper and lower jaws. Its close relative &quot;Mustela&quot; has just three. The fisher has 38 teeth. The dentition formula is: 

=== Evolution ===
Some evidence shows that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5.0 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, &quot;Pekania palaeosinensis&quot; and &quot;P. anderssoni&quot;, have been found in eastern Asia. The first true fisher, &quot;P. diluviana&quot;, has only been found in Middle Pleistocene North America. &quot;P. diluviana&quot; is strongly indicated to be related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. &quot;P. pennanti&quot; has been found as early as the Late Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. No major differences are seen between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher&#x27;s range extended farther south than it does today.

Three subspecies were identified by Goldman in 1935, &quot;Martes pennanti columbiana&quot;, &quot;M. p. pacifica&quot;, and &quot;M. p. pennanti&quot;. Later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general, the fisher is recognized to be a monotypic species with no extant subspecies.

== Physical characteristics ==

Fishers&#x27; bodies are long, thin, and low to the ground. The sexes have similar physical features, but they are sexually dimorphic in size, with the male being much larger than the female. Males are in total length and weigh . Females measure and weigh . Head and body lengths for both sexes range from ; the tail adding a further . The largest male fisher ever recorded weighed .

The fisher&#x27;s fur changes with the season and differs slightly between sexes. Males have coarser coats than females. In the early winter, the coats are dense and glossy, ranging from on the chest to on the back. The color ranges from deep brown to black, although it appears to be much blacker in the winter when contrasted with white snow. From the face to the shoulders, fur can be hoary-gold or silver due to tricolored guard hairs. The underside of a fisher is almost completely brown except for randomly placed patches of white or cream-colored fur. In the summer, the fur color is more variable and may lighten considerably. Fishers undergo moulting starting in late summer and finishing by November or December.

Fishers have five toes on each foot, with unsheathed, retractable claws. Their feet are large, making it easier for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, four central pads are on each foot. On the hind paws are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on slippery surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180°, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.

A circular patch of hair on the central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor. Since these patches become enlarged during breeding season, they are likely used to make a scent trail to allow fishers to find each other so they can mate.

== Biology and behavior ==
=== Hunting and diet ===
Fishers are generalist predators. Although their primary prey is snowshoe hares and porcupines, they are also known to supplement their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. They have been observed eating small apples during winter. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even deer—the latter indicating that they are not averse to eating carrion. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, raccoon, fox, marten, mink, otter, bobcat, and Canada lynx. Raccoons may be killed by a large fisher in trees or on the ground. Fishers can also catch martens on the ground or in the trees, and usually there is either a good population of fisher or marten but not both. Researchers in Maine have found &quot;about a dozen&quot; cases of confirmed fisher predation on Canada lynx, and several more suspected cases, in a four-township area of Maine. According to Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife wildlife biologist Scott McClellan, the fishers involved in these kills attacked lynx bedded down in snowstorms with a quick &quot;powerful grip&quot; bite to the lynx&#x27;s neck. Signs of struggle indicated that some lynx attempted to defend themselves but McClellan states that &quot;the fishers would finish the cats off pretty quickly. There was some struggle certainly, but it didn&#x27;t appear to last very long. There were some broken branches, tufts of fur, and claw marks where the lynx was trying to get away.&quot; The McClellan study in The Journal of Wildlife Management documents 14 fisher-caused mortalities of Canada lynx from 1999 to 2011 in northern Maine, and found that predation was the leading source of mortality of lynx in the study area (18 deaths, 14 by fisher).

Fishers are one of the few predators that seek out and kill porcupines. Stories in popular literature indicate that fishers can flip a porcupine onto its back and &quot;scoop out its belly like a ripe melon&quot;. This was identified as an exaggerated misconception as early as 1966. Observational studies show that fishers make repeated biting attacks on the face of a porcupine and kill it after about 25–30 minutes.

=== Reproduction ===
The female fisher begins to breed at about one year of age and her reproductive cycle is an almost year-long event. Mating takes place in late March to early April. Blastocyst implantation is then delayed for ten months until mid-February of the following year when active pregnancy begins. After gestating for about 50 days, the female gives birth to one to four kits. The female then enters estrus 7–10 days later and the breeding cycle begins again.

Females den in hollow trees. Kits are born blind, helpless, and are partially covered with fine hair. Kits begin to crawl after about three weeks. After about seven weeks, they open their eyes. They start to climb after eight weeks. Kits are completely dependent on their mother&#x27;s milk for the first eight to ten weeks, after which they begin to switch to a solid diet. After four months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at five months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.

=== Social structure and home range ===
Fishers are generally crepuscular, being most active at dawn and dusk. They are active year-round, and are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating. Males become more active during mating season. Females are least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.

A fisher&#x27;s hunting range varies from in the summer to in the winter. Ranges up to in the winter are possible depending on the quality of the habitat. Male and female fishers have overlapping territories. This behavior is imposed on females by males due to dominance in size and a male&#x27;s desire to increase mating success.

=== Predators and parasites ===
As far as is known, adult fishers are not regularly subject to predation. Predators of the fisher included bears (&quot;Ursus spp&quot;), coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), lynxes (&quot;Lynx&quot; sp.), mountain lions (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), wolverines (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), and possibly great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;).

Parasites of fishers include nematode &quot;Baylisascaris devosi&quot;, tapeworm &quot;Taenia sibirica&quot;, nematode &quot;Physaloptera&quot; sp., trematodes &quot;Alaria mustelae&quot; and &quot;Metorchis conjunctus&quot;, nematode &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;, and &quot;Molineus&quot; sp.

== Habitat ==

Although fishers are competent tree climbers, they spend most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. They have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest, but are also common in mixed-hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appear to be unsuitable for their needs.

Fishers also select for forest floors with large amounts of coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire regularly removes understory debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.

== Distribution ==

Fishers are widespread throughout the northern forests of North America. They are present in the boreal and mixed deciduous-coniferous forest belt that runs across Canada from Nova Scotia in the east to the Pacific shore of British Columbia and north to Alaska. They are present as far north as Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories and as far south as the mountains of Oregon. Isolated populations occur in the Sierra Nevada of California, throughout New England, in the Catskill mountains of New York and the Appalachian Mountains of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fishers were virtually eliminated from the southern and eastern parts of their range, including most American states and eastern Canada including Nova Scotia. Overtrapping and loss of forest habitat were the reasons for the decline.

Most states had placed restrictions on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental with the end of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became re-established, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.

Scattered fisher populations now exist in the Pacific Northwest. In 1961, fishers from British Columbia and Minnesota were reintroduced in Oregon to the southern Cascades near Klamath Falls and to the Wallowa Mountains near La Grande. From 1977 to 1980, fishers were introduced to the region around Crater Lake. Starting in January 2008, fishers were reintroduced into Washington State. The initial reintroduction was on the Olympic peninsula (90 animals), with subsequent reintroductions into the south Cascade Mountains. The reintroduced animals are monitored by radio collars and remote cameras, and have been shown to be reproducing. From 2008 to 2011, about 40 fishers were reintroduced in the northern Sierra Nevada near Stirling City, complementing fisher populations in Yosemite National Park and along California&#x27;s northern boundary between the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Klamath Mountains. Fishers are a protected species in Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. In Idaho and California, fishers are protected through a closed trapping season, but they are not afforded any specific protection; however, in California the fisher has been granted threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. In June 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended that fishers be removed from the endangered list in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

Recent studies, as well as anecdotal evidence, show that fishers have begun making inroads into suburban backyards, farmland, and periurban areas in several US states and eastern Canada, as far south as most of northern Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Minnesota and Iowa, and even northwestern New Jersey. Having virtually disappeared after the construction of the Cape Cod Canal in the early 1900s, some reports have shown that populations have become re-established on Cape Cod, although the populations are likely smaller than the populations in the western part of New England.

== Relationship with humans ==
Fishers have had a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the detriment of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a 12-year-old boy.

=== Fur trade and conservation ===
Fishers have been trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers due to the value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. It is reported that fisher tails were used in the making of spodiks, a form of ceremonial hat worn by Jews of certain Hasidic sects.

The best pelts are from winter trapping, with secondary-quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.

Prices for pelts have varied considerably over the past 100 years. They were highest in the 1920s and 1930s, when average prices were about US$100. In 1936, pelts were being offered for sale in New York City for $450–750 per pelt. Prices declined through the 1960s, but picked up again in the late 1970s. In 1979, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company paid $410 for one female pelt. In 1999, 16,638 pelts were sold in Canada for C$449,307 at an average price of $27.

Between 1900 and 1940, fishers were threatened with near extinction in the southern part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest over 3,000 fishers per year. Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but total protection was not given to the few remaining fishers until 1934. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.

Trapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962, once numbers had recovered sufficiently. During the early 1970s, the value of fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After a few years of closed seasons, fisher trapping reopened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.

=== Captivity ===

Fishers have been captured live for fur farming, zoo specimens, and scientific research. From 1920–1946, pelt prices averaged about C$137. Since pelts were relatively valuable, attempts were made to raise fishers on farms. Fur farming was popular with other species such as mink and ermine, so the same techniques were thought to be applicable to fishers. However, farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle. In general, knowledge of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at the time. Farmers noted that females mated in the spring but did not give birth. Due to declining pelt prices, most fisher farms closed operations by the late 1940s.

Fishers have also been captured and bred by zoos, but they are not a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet at least one example shows a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be 10 years old, and another living to be about 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.

In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for the purpose of performing scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula.

=== Interactions with domestic animals ===
In some areas, fishers can become pests to farmers when they raid chicken coops, and instances of fishers preying on cats and small dogs have been reported. However, a 1979 study examined the stomach contents of all fishers trapped in the state of New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only one of over 1,000 stomachs. An informal unfinished 2011 study in suburban upstate New York found no cat remains in 24 scat or stomach samples, and an earlier published study found no cat in 226 Massachusetts samples.

=== Poisoning ===
In 2012, a study conducted by the Integral Ecology Research Center, UC Davis, U.S. Forest Service, and the Hoopa tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and four fishers died from this exposure. A 2015 follow-up study building on these data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that 9 more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers&#x27; home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.

=== Literature ===
One of the first mentions of fishers in literature occurred in &quot;The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories&quot;. Robert Snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in the woods of the Adirondack Mountains of New York. He recounts three sightings, including one where he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine.

In &quot;Winter of the Fisher&quot;, Cameron Langford relates a fictional encounter between a fisher and an aging recluse living in the forest. The recluse frees the fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.

Fishers are mentioned in several other books, including &quot;The Blood Jaguar&quot; (an animal shaman), &quot;Ereth&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (a porcupine hunter), Egg Marks The Spot (a treasure hunter), and in &quot;The Sign of the Beaver&quot;, where a fisher is thought to have been caught in a trap.

<text>Brian William Pallister (born July 6, 1954) is a Canadian politician who served as the 22nd premier of Manitoba from 2016 until 2021. He served as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba from 2012 to 2021. He had been a cabinet minister in the provincial government of Gary Filmon and a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 2000 to 2008.

==Early life and career==
Pallister was born in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, the son of Anne Ethel (Poyser) and Bill Pallister. He holds Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education degrees from Brandon University. From 1976 to 1979, he worked as a high school teacher in rural Manitoba, where he also served as the local union representative. He later became a chartered financial analyst. Pallister is also a skilled curler and won the provincial mixed curling championship in 2000. This qualified him for the 2001 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship, which he finished with a 3–8 record in second last place.

==Provincial politics==
Pallister began his political career at the provincial level, winning a by-election in Portage la Prairie on September 15, 1992, as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. He entered the provincial legislature as a backbench supporter of the Filmon government and pushed for balanced budget legislation. In 1993, he endorsed Jean Charest&#x27;s bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Pallister was reelected in the 1995 provincial election, and sworn into cabinet on May 9, 1995, as Minister of Government Services. He carried out reforms that eliminated almost 3,000 pages of statutory regulations as part of a government campaign against regulations, presided over changes to the Manitoba Disaster Assistance Board, and oversaw provincial flood claims. He stepped down from cabinet on January 6, 1997, to prepare for his first federal campaign.

Pallister defeated Paul-Emile Labossiere to win the Progressive Conservative nomination for Portage—Lisgar in the 1997 federal election, and formally resigned his seat in the legislature on April 28, 1997. He lost to Reform Party incumbent Jake Hoeppner by 1,449 votes.

There were rumours that Pallister would campaign to succeed Filmon as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 2000, but he declined.

== Federal politics ==

===1998 Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership bid===

In 1998, Pallister campaigned for the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservative Party on a platform designed to win back voters who had left the party for Reform. His supporters included former cabinet ministers Don Mazankowski and Charlie Mayer, Senator Consiglio Di Nino, and Jim Jones, the sole Progressive Conservative representative in the House of Commons from Ontario. He finished fourth on the first ballot of the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election with 12.5% support, behind David Orchard, Hugh Segal, and the eventual winner, former Prime Minister Joe Clark. He withdrew from the contest a few days later. Pallister said that Progressive Conservatives had &quot;voted for the past&quot; and missed an opportunity to renew themselves.

===Canadian Alliance MP===

In July 2000, Pallister wrote an open letter to Joe Clark announcing his candidacy in the next federal election with a dual endorsement from the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance associations in Portage-Lisgar. The latter party was a successor to Reform, and emerged from the efforts of Reformers to merge with Blue Tory elements in the Progressive Conservative Party who opposed Clark&#x27;s Red Tory leadership. Clark had previously rejected Pallister&#x27;s proposal as a violation of the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s constitution, and did not respond to the letter. As a result, Pallister left the Progressive Conservatives and joined the Alliance on August 17, 2000. He won his new party&#x27;s nomination for Portage—Lisgar over Dennis Desrochers and former MP Felix Holtmann, in a contest marked by some bitterness.

Pallister was elected to the House of Commons in the 2000 general election, defeating his nearest opponent by over 10,000 votes. Hoeppner, running as an independent, finished in a distant fourth place. The Liberal Party won a majority government, and Pallister served on the opposition benches. He did not openly endorse anyone in the 2002 Canadian Alliance leadership election.

===Conservative MP===

The Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative parties merged on December 7, 2003, and Pallister became a member of the resulting Conservative Party of Canada. He considered launching a bid for the new party&#x27;s leadership, but instead endorsed outgoing Alliance leader Stephen Harper for the position. He was easily reelected in the 2004 election, in which the Liberals were reduced to a minority government. In July 2004, he was appointed to the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet as critic for National Revenue.

Pallister gained increased national prominence in September 2005 after drawing attention to $750,000 of apparent spending irregularities in the office of David Dingwall, the Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Canadian Mint. Dingwall resigned after the accusations were publicized, but later claimed that his expenditures were inaccurately reported and fell within official guidelines. An independent review completed in late October 2005 found only minor discrepancies in Dingwall&#x27;s expenses, amounting to less than $7,000. Pallister criticized this review as &quot;little more than a whitewash&quot;, and argued that the auditors failed to include numerous ambiguous expenses.

Pallister sang a parody of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part Two&quot; in the House of Commons on October 3, 2005, during the &quot;Statements by Members&quot; session before Question Period. The adjusted lyrics attacked David Dingwall and the Liberal government. The Speaker ruled him out of order.

Before the 2006 federal election, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; reported that some Manitoba Progressive Conservatives were trying to persuade Pallister to challenge Stuart Murray for the provincial leadership. Murray subsequently resigned, after 45% of delegates at the party&#x27;s November 2005 convention voted for a leadership review. A subsequent &quot;Free Press&quot; poll showed Pallister as the second-most popular choice to succeed Murray, after fellow MP Vic Toews. Pallister campaigned for reelection at the federal level and was noncommittal about his provincial ambitions.

Pallister was easily reelected in 2006. The Conservatives won a minority government, and Pallister requested that incoming Prime Minister Stephen Harper not consider him for a cabinet portfolio while he was making his decision about entering provincial politics. On February 17, 2006, he announced that he would not seek the provincial party leadership and would remain a federal MP. He was appointed chair of the House of Commons standing committee on Finance, and in 2007 indicated that he wanted to remove financial access to offshore tax havens such as Barbados. Later in the year, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of International Trade and to the Minister for International Cooperation.

Pallister surprised political observers in January 2008 by announcing that he would not run in the next federal election.

== Return to provincial politics ==
=== Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba ===
After the 2011 provincial election, Hugh McFadyen announced his resignation as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. On April 11, 2012, Pallister announced his intention to seek the party&#x27;s leadership. On July 28, he became the presumptive nominee when the nomination process closed with no other candidates entered, and was acclaimed as leader on July 30, 2012. Two months later, he easily won a by-election for McFadyen&#x27;s seat of Fort Whyte in southwest Winnipeg.

Pallister came under fire by his critics for some off-color remarks he made while opposition leader. In 2013, when filming a holiday greeting, he called atheists &quot;infidels&quot;. Pallister said that he never intended to offend anyone with the statement.

During a debate in the Legislature on November 24, 2014, Pallister expressed his personal disdain for Halloween when talking about the NDP&#x27;s PST tax increase. He compared the government&#x27;s move to that of the holiday and said Halloween was bad for the integrity of children. The video went viral a year after the statement was made.

===2016 Manitoba general election===
On April 14, 2016, a CBC News report revealed that Pallister had traveled to Costa Rica 15 times since elected to Manitoba MLA in 2012. Since then, he spent about 240 days either in Costa Rica or en route.

Pallister&#x27;s Tories went into the election having led in most opinion polls for almost four years. Greg Selinger&#x27;s NDP government had raised the provincial sales tax after promising not to do so. Pallister led his party to a decisive victory over the NDP, claiming 40 of the 57 available seats in the legislature – the biggest majority government in recent Manitoba history. He also became the first Progressive Conservative premier of the province since Filmon lost the 1999 election.

==Premier of Manitoba (2016–2021)==

Pallister and his cabinet were sworn in on May 3, 2016. He led the PCs to re-election with a slightly decreased majority in 2019.

=== Economic policy ===

====Housing====

In June 2019, Pallister&#x27;s government signed onto the National Housing Strategy with the federal government. The 10-year agreement with the federal government promised to invest almost $450.8 million to expand and repair social and community housing in the province. The strategy was cost shared by both levels of government, with Manitoba contributing $225.4 million to the agreement.

==== PST changes ====

Pallister reduced Manitoba&#x27;s provincial sales tax (PST) to 7 percent (down from 8 percent) in his government&#x27;s 2019 budget, effective July 1. In 2021, his government exempted the PST from personal services such as haircuts and salon services.

====Carbon tax====

Pallister, just like fellow conservative premiers Doug Ford, Jason Kenney and Scott Moe, is opposed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s federal-imposed carbon tax. In 2019, Pallister&#x27;s government filed a court challenge against it. On March 25, 2021, when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government&#x27;s carbon tax plan is constitutional, Pallister said that Manitoba will continue the challenge.

===COVID-19 pandemic===

Pallister led the provincial government response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba. In December 2020, he received international attention and praise on social media for his &quot;impassioned plea&quot; for adherence to social distancing restrictions during the Holiday season to keep people safe. However, many of these social media posts were later taken down when it came to light that Manitobans were reported as finding the province&#x27;s response too slow, waiting for infection rates to soar before increasing restrictions, allowing the virus a rapid spread into October and November, when the province witnessed the worst per capita rate of infection in Canada. Critics of Pallister&#x27;s government blamed the surge of COVID-19 cases in part on Pallister&#x27;s Restart Manitoba plan, which encouraged the re-opening of the provincial economy in direct opposition to the advice of many Manitoba doctors. Pallister faced similar criticism during the third wave of the virus in May 2021, with changes to the Public Health Orders coming weeks after some critics first called for. Critics rejected his assertions that the province had already imposed some of the toughest restrictions in the country, with Opposition Party Leaders alleging he was not competent to govern in a pandemic. The Pallister government&#x27;s slow response during the third wave further led to a lack of space in intensive care units in Manitoba and the transfer of several patients to hospitals out of province in Thunder Bay, Sault Ste Marie, North Bay, and Ottawa, many of whom died either en route or far from family and advocates.

===Indigenous relations===

On July 7, 2021, Pallister gained controversy when he made remarks about colonial settlers, some who operated the Canadian Indian residential school system, stating that &quot;the people [colonists] who came here to this country, before it was a country and since, didn&#x27;t come here to destroy anything. They came here to build. They came to build better.&quot; The comments prompted his Minister of Indigenous Reconciliation and Northern Relations, Eileen Clarke, to resign. Her successor, Alan Lagimodiere, instantly gained controversy after he defended the residential school system, saying that &quot;At the time I think the intent…they thought they were doing the right thing. In retrospect, it&#x27;s easy to judge in the past. But at the time, they really thought that they were doing the right thing.&quot; Weeks later, Pallister apologised for his comments, although many First Nations chiefs were unsatisfied with his apology, believing that it was insufficient and came too late.

=== Resignation ===

On August 10, 2021, Palister announced that he would be resigning as Premier on September 1 and not be seeking re-election in the next provincial election. Deputy Premier Kelvin Goertzen was chosen as interim leader of the PCs and officially took over as premier on September 1. Pallister resigned his seat in the legislature on October 4. Health Minister Heather Stefanson was elected as Pallister&#x27;s permanent successor on October 30, and was sworn in as premier on November 2.

<doc id="544505" wikidata="Q1479681" url="?curid=544505" title="Mucopolysaccharidosis">
<text>Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of metabolic disorders caused by the absence or malfunctioning of lysosomal enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These long chains of sugar carbohydrates occur within the cells that help build bone, cartilage, tendons, corneas, skin and connective tissue. GAGs (formerly called mucopolysaccharides) are also found in the fluids that lubricate joints.

Individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis either do not produce enough of one of the eleven enzymes required to break down these sugar chains into simpler molecules, or they produce enzymes that do not work properly. Over time, these GAGs collect in the cells, blood and connective tissues. The result is permanent, progressive cellular damage which affects appearance, physical abilities, organ and system functioning.

The mucopolysaccharidoses are part of the lysosomal storage disease family, a group of genetic disorders that result when the lysosome organelle in animal cells malfunctions. The lysosome can be thought of as the cell&#x27;s recycling center because it processes unwanted material into other substances that the cell can utilize. Lysosomes break down this unwanted matter via enzymes, highly specialized proteins essential for survival. Lysosomal disorders like mucopolysaccharidosis are triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether.

==Signs and symptoms==

The mucopolysaccharidoses share many clinical features but have varying degrees of severity. These features may not be apparent at birth but progress as storage of GAGs affects bone, skeletal structure, connective tissues, and organs. Neurological complications may include damage to neurons (which send and receive signals throughout the body) as well as pain and impaired motor function. This results from compression of nerves or nerve roots in the spinal cord or in the peripheral nervous system, the part of the nervous system that connects the brain and spinal cord to sensory organs such as the eyes and to other organs, muscles, and tissues throughout the body.

Depending on the mucopolysaccharidosis subtype, affected individuals may have normal intellect or have cognitive impairments, may experience developmental delay, or may have severe behavioral problems. Many individuals have hearing loss, either conductive (in which pressure behind the eardrum causes fluid from the lining of the middle ear to build up and eventually congeal), neurosensory (in which tiny hair cells in the inner ear are damaged), or both. Communicating hydrocephalus—in which the normal reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and causes increased pressure inside the head—is common in some of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Surgically inserting a shunt into the brain can drain fluid. The eye&#x27;s cornea often becomes cloudy from intracellular storage, and glaucoma and degeneration of the retina also may affect the patient&#x27;s vision.

Physical symptoms generally include coarse or rough facial features (including a flat nasal bridge, thick lips, and enlarged mouth and tongue), short stature with disproportionately short trunk (dwarfism), dysplasia (abnormal bone size and/or shape) and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), hernias, and excessive body hair growth. Short and often claw-like hands, progressive joint stiffness, and carpal tunnel syndrome can restrict hand mobility and function. Recurring respiratory infections are common, as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Many affected individuals also have heart disease, often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves.

Another lysosomal storage disease often confused with the mucopolysaccharidoses is mucolipidosis. In this disorder, excessive amounts of fatty materials known as lipids (another principal component of living cells) are stored, in addition to sugars. Persons with mucolipidosis may share some of the clinical features associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses (certain facial features, bony structure abnormalities, and damage to the brain), and increased amounts of the enzymes needed to break down the lipids are found in the blood.

==Genetics==

It is estimated that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will have some form of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns will experience severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I, while approximately 1 in 500,000 newborns will experience attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Most mucopolysaccharidoses are autosomal recessive disorders, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis often can be made through clinical examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis of one of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who have a family history of the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.

===Types===
Seven distinct clinical types and numerous subtypes of the mucopolysaccharidoses have been identified. Although each mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) differs clinically, most patients generally experience a period of normal development followed by a decline in physical and/or mental function. (Note: MPS-V and MPS-VIII are no longer in use as designations for any disease.)

===Overview table===
===MPS I===
MPS I is divided into three subtypes based on severity of symptoms. All three types result from an absence of, or insufficient levels of, the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. Children born to an MPS I parent carry the defective gene.
* MPS I H (also called Hurler syndrome or α-L-iduronidase deficiency), is the most severe of the MPS I subtypes. Developmental delay is evident by the end of the first year, and patients usually stop developing between ages 2 and 4. This is followed by progressive mental decline and loss of physical skills. Language may be limited due to hearing loss and an enlarged tongue. In time, the clear layers of the cornea become clouded and retinas may begin to degenerate. Carpal tunnel syndrome (or similar compression of nerves elsewhere in the body) and restricted joint movement are common.

: Affected children may be quite large at birth and appear normal but may have inguinal (in the groin) or umbilical (where the umbilical cord passes through the abdomen) hernias. Growth in height may be faster than normal but begins to slow before the end of the first year and often ends around age 3. Many children develop a short body trunk and a maximum stature of less than 4 feet. Distinct facial features (including flat face, depressed nasal bridge, and bulging forehead) become more evident in the second year. By age 2, the ribs have widened and are oar-shaped. The liver, spleen, and heart are often enlarged. Children may experience noisy breathing and recurring upper respiratory tract and ear infections. Feeding may be difficult for some children, and many experience periodic bowel problems. Children with Hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, and cardiac complications.
* MPS I S, Scheie syndrome, is the mildest form of MPS I. Symptoms generally begin to appear after age 5, with diagnosis most commonly made after age 10. Children with Scheie syndrome have normal intelligence or may have mild learning disabilities; some may have psychiatric problems. Glaucoma, retinal degeneration, and clouded corneas may significantly impair vision. Other problems include carpal tunnel syndrome or other nerve compression, stiff joints, claw hands and deformed feet, a short neck, and aortic valve disease. Some affected individuals also have obstructive airway disease and sleep apnea. Persons with Scheie syndrome can live into adulthood.
* MPS I H-S, Hurler–Scheie syndrome, is less severe than Hurler syndrome alone. Symptoms generally begin between ages 3 and 8. Children may have moderate intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Skeletal and systemic irregularities include short stature, marked smallness in the jaws, progressive joint stiffness, compressed spinal cord, clouded corneas, hearing loss, heart disease, coarse facial features, and umbilical hernia. Respiratory problems, sleep apnea, and heart disease may develop in adolescence. Some persons with MPS I H-S need continuous positive airway pressure during sleep to ease breathing. Life expectancy is generally into the late teens or early twenties.

Although no studies have been done to determine the frequency of MPS I in the United States, studies in British Columbia estimate that 1 in 100,000 babies born has Hurler syndrome. The estimate for Scheie syndrome is one in 500,000 births and for Hurler-Scheie syndrome it is one in 115,000 births.

===MPS II===
MPS II, Hunter syndrome or iduronate sulfatase deficiency, is caused by lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. Hunter syndrome has two clinical subtypes and (since it shows X-linked recessive inheritance) is the only one of the mucopolysaccharidoses in which the mother alone can pass the defective gene to a son. The incidence of Hunter syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 male births.

===MPS III===
MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome, is marked by severe neurological symptoms. These include progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, some deafness and loss of vision, and an inability to sleep for more than a few hours at a time. This disorder tends to have three main stages. During the first stage, early mental and motor skill development may be somewhat delayed. Affected children show a marked decline in learning between ages 2 and 6, followed by eventual loss of language skills and loss of some or all hearing. Some children may never learn to speak. In the syndrome&#x27;s second stage, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, profound dementia, and irregular sleep may make children difficult to manage, particularly those who retain normal physical strength. In the syndrome&#x27;s last stage, children become increasingly unsteady on their feet and most are unable to walk by age 10.

Thickened skin and mild changes in facial features, bone, and skeletal structures become noticeable with age. Growth in height usually stops by age 10. Other problems may include narrowing of the airway passage in the throat and enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids, making it difficult to eat or swallow. Recurring respiratory infections are common.

There are four distinct types of Sanfilippo syndrome, each caused by alteration of a different enzyme needed to completely break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain. Little clinical difference exists between these four types but symptoms appear most severe and seem to progress more quickly in children with type A. The average duration of Sanfilippo syndrome is 8 to 10 years following onset of symptoms. Most persons with MPS III live into their teenage years, and some live longer.
* Sanfilippo A is the most severe of the MPS III disorders and is caused by the missing or altered enzyme heparan N-sulfatase. Children with Sanfilippo A have the shortest survival rate among those with the MPS III disorders.
* Sanfilippo B is caused by the missing or deficient enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase.
* Sanfilippo C results from the missing or altered enzyme acetyl-CoAlpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase.
* Sanfilippo D is caused by the missing or deficient enzyme N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase.

The incidence of Sanfilippo syndrome (for all four types combined) is about one in 70,000 births.

===MPS IV===
MPS IV, Morquio syndrome, is estimated to occur in 1 in 700,000 births. Its two subtypes result from the missing or deficient enzymes N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) (Type A) or beta-galactosidase (Type B) needed to break down the keratan sulfate sugar chain. Clinical features are similar in both types but appear milder in Morquio Type B. Onset is between ages 1 and 3. Neurological complications include spinal nerve and nerve root compression resulting from extreme, progressive skeletal changes, particularly in the ribs and chest; conductive and/or neurosensitive loss of hearing and clouded corneas. Intelligence is normal unless hydrocephalus develops and is not treated.

Physical growth slows generally around the age of 18 months, and stops completely by the age of 8. Skeletal abnormalities include a bell-shaped chest, a flattening or curvature of the spine, shortened long bones, and dysplasia of the hips, knees, ankles, and wrists. The bones that stabilize the connection between the head and neck can be malformed (odontoid hypoplasia); in these cases, a surgical procedure called spinal cervical bone fusion can be lifesaving. Restricted breathing, joint stiffness, and heart disease are also common. Children with the more severe form of Morquio syndrome may not live beyond their twenties or thirties.

===MPS VI===
Children with MPS VI, Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome, usually have normal intellectual development but share many of the physical symptoms found in Hurler syndrome. Caused by the deficient enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome has a variable spectrum of severe symptoms. Neurological complications include clouded corneas, deafness, thickening of the dura (the membrane that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord), and pain caused by compressed or traumatized nerves and nerve roots.

Growth is normal at first but stops suddenly around age 8. By age 10 children have developed a shortened trunk, crouched stance, and restricted joint movement. In more severe cases, children also develop a protruding abdomen and forward-curving spine. Skeletal changes (particularly in the pelvic region) are progressive and limit movement. Many children also have umbilical or inguinal hernias. Nearly all children have some form of heart disease.

An enzyme replacement therapy was tested on patients with MPS VI and was successful in that it improved growth and joint movement. An experiment was then carried out to see whether an injection of the missing enzyme into the hips would help the range of motion and pain.

===MPS VII===
MPS VII, Sly syndrome, one of the least common forms of the mucopolysaccharidoses, is estimated to occur in fewer than one in 250,000 births. The disorder is caused by deficiency of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase. In its rarest form, Sly syndrome causes children to be born with hydrops fetalis, in which extreme amounts of fluid are retained in the body. Survival is usually a few months or less. Most children with Sly syndrome are less severely affected. Neurological symptoms may include mild to moderate intellectual disability by age 3, communicating hydrocephalus, nerve entrapment, corneal clouding, and some loss of peripheral and night vision. Other symptoms include short stature, some skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness and restricted movement, and umbilical and/or inguinal hernias. Some patients may have repeated bouts of pneumonia during their first years of life. Most children with Sly syndrome live into the teenage or young adult years.

===MPS IX===
As of 2001, only one case of MPS IX () had been reported. The disorder results from hyaluronidase deficiency. Symptoms included nodular soft-tissue masses located around joints, with episodes of painful swelling of the masses and pain that ended spontaneously within 3 days. Pelvic radiography showed multiple soft-tissue masses and some bone erosion. Other traits included mild facial changes, acquired short stature as seen in other MPS disorders, and normal joint movement and intelligence.

==Treatment==
Currently there is no cure for these disorders. Medical care is directed at treating systemic conditions and improving the person&#x27;s quality of life. Physical therapy and daily exercise may delay joint problems and improve the ability to move.

Changes to the diet will not prevent disease progression, but limiting milk, sugar, and dairy products has helped some individuals experiencing excessive mucus.

Surgery to remove tonsils and adenoids may improve breathing among affected individuals with obstructive airway disorders and sleep apnea. Sleep studies can assess airway status and the possible need for nighttime oxygen. Some patients may require surgical insertion of an endotrachial tube to aid breathing. Surgery can also correct hernias, help drain excessive cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, and free nerves and nerve roots compressed by skeletal and other abnormalities. Corneal transplants may improve vision among patients with significant corneal clouding.

Enzyme replacement therapy has proven useful in reducing non-neurological symptoms and pain. Currently BioMarin Pharmaceutical produces enzyme replacement therapies for MPS type I and VI. Aldurazyme is an enzymatic replacement therapy for alpha-L-iduronidase produced by BioMarin for use in Type I MPS. In May 2005, galsulfase (under the name Naglazyme), a recombinant enzyme replacement therapy also produced by Biomarin was approved for MPS VI (Marateaux-Lamy syndrome). In July 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a synthetic version of I2S produced by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group, called Elaprase, as a treatment for MPS type II (Hunter syndrome). Vestronidase alfa (Mepsevii) is a recombinant human lysosomal beta glucuronidase for MPS VII (Sly syndrome) approved in the United States in November 2017 (Ultragenyx).

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) have had limited success in treating the mucopolysaccharidoses. Abnormal physical characteristics, except for those affecting the skeleton and eyes, may be improved, but neurologic outcomes have varied. BMT and UCBT are high-risk procedures and are usually performed only after family members receive extensive evaluation and counseling.

<doc id="544506" wikidata="Q1739062" url="?curid=544506" title="Howea">
<text>Howea is a genus of two palms, &quot;H. belmoreana&quot; and &quot;H. forsteriana&quot;, both endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia. &quot;H. forsteriana&quot; in particular is commonly grown as an indoor plant in the Northern Hemisphere, and the two species form the mainstay of the island&#x27;s palm seed industry and more importantly its trade in newly germinated seedlings. The palms are also cultivated on Norfolk Island, where seeds are produced for export.

==Description==
Both &quot;Howea&quot; species are unarmed, monoecious palms of moderate size. The trunk is erect, bare, and carries prominent leaf scars, with its base sometimes expanded into a knob-like shape. There is no crownshaft. The leaves are pinnate, and the well-developed sheaths eventually disintegrate into a criss-crossed mass of fine fibres around the trunk. The inflorescences, erect at first but later pendulous, appear between the leaf stems, although as a result of leaf-fall they may appear to have arisen from below the leaves.

==Species identification==
The two species can be distinguished by leaf anatomy: &quot;H. forsteriana&quot; has rather flat fronds with elegantly drooping leaflets, while &quot;H. belmoreana&quot; has curved leaves with erect leaflets giving the fronds a more angular appearance. More technically, if the inflorescence is a single spike and the rachis of the leaves is arcuate, the species is &quot;H. belmoreana&quot;. If the inflorescence consists of 3 to 5 (up to a maximum of 8) spikes arising from a single broad base, and the rachis of central and lower leaves is horizontal and drooping, the species is &quot;H. forsteriana&quot;.

==Distribution==
&quot;H. forsteriana&quot; is common in lowland forest on Lord Howe Island, preferring sandy soils. &quot;H. belmoreana&quot; occurs as scattered individuals with &quot;H. forsteriana&quot;, but becomes abundant at higher elevations up to 450 metres. Hybridisation between the two species is rare because &quot;H. forsteriana&quot; flowers seven weeks earlier than &quot;H. belmoreana&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Lord Howe Island, at approximately 31°S, has a subtropical climate. Summers are mild to warm with regular rain, and winters are wetter and somewhat cooler. Average maximum temperatures range between 17 °C and 20 °C in winter and from 24 °C to 27 °C in the summer. In winter, average minimum temperatures range between 12 °C and 15 °C, and 18 °C to 22 °C in summer. Humidity averages in the 60 to 70 per cent range all year round.

&quot;Howea&quot; spp. grow well in subtropical climes, and are hardy to the USDA zone 9b. They are widely grown in warm temperate climates, and there are also occasional healthy specimens in tropical areas such as Hawaii. &quot;H. belmoreana&quot;, with its erect fronds and aversion to life in a pot, is not as commonly cultivated indoors as the graceful &quot;H. forsteriana&quot;, which is often referred to as the Kentia palm.

<text>Kat O (), also named Crooked Island, is an island in northeast Hong Kong.

==Administration==
Administratively, Kat O is part of North District. It is a recognized village under the New Territories Small House Policy.

==Geography==
Kat O is located in the west of Mirs Bay. With an area of 2.35 km², it is the largest island in North District, the second largest being Wong Wan Chau (Double Island). Neighbouring islands include Ap Chau, Ngo Mei Chau (Crescent Island), and Pak Sha Chau (Round Island). The village of Tung O () is located on its northwest coast. Its highest point is Kai Kung Leng (), which is 122 m above sea level.

O Pui Tong () is a bay surrounded by the crook-shaped Crooked Island and Yeung Chau. O Pui Tong, together with the northwestern waters of Kat O, are two of the 26 designated marine fish culture zones in Hong Kong.

==History==
Kat O was once a major fishing market in Hong Kong, and long served as an important stopover for boats travelling between Hong Kong and the rest of China.

During the Ming dynasty, a decree required all inhabitants to leave the island. Then in the 1660s, soon after the end of the dynasty, it was re-settled by Hakka people. Other residents were Tanka fishermen.

==Features==
The Tin Hau Temple at Kat O is estimated to be built in 1763. It is listed as a Grade III historic building. Part of the temple building was used for the Tat O School until the school was moved to a new location in 1957. A Pak Kung Shrine is also located in the vicinity.

The island is home to three cannons. These are thought to have been made in the west, during the 19th century.

==Conservation==
Kat O has been part of the Plover Cove (Extension) Country Park since 1979.

The Kat O Nature Trail is 1 km long, stretching from the Kat O Ferry Pier to Ko Tei Teng ().

The Kat O Geoheritage Centre (at No. 142 Kat O Main Street) was opened in 2010 by Kat O villagers, volunteer groups and the government to raise public awareness of geo-conservation, as part of the Hong Kong Geopark.

<doc id="544524" wikidata="Q5027794" url="?curid=544524" title="Campaign for Freedom of Information">
<text>The Campaign for Freedom of Information is an advocacy group that promotes and defends freedom of information in the UK. It seeks to strengthen the public&#x27;s rights under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and related laws and opposes attempts to weaken them. It does this through campaigning, the publication of briefings and other reports and research. The Campaign also provides advice to the public and assistance to people challenging unreasonable refusals to disclose information, and runs training courses on freedom of information.

The Campaign is a not-for-profit company, unaffiliated to any political party, (registration number 1781526) governed by a board of non-executive directors. It is funded mainly by grants from charitable foundations, donations and income from training. Maurice Frankel has been its director since 1987.

==History==

=== 1984–1996 ===
The Campaign was founded in 1984 by citizen campaigner Des Wilson to secure a freedom of information law in the UK. The organisation was officially launched on 5 January 1984 with the support of the three main opposition party leaders of the time and 150 MPs from all parties. The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, opposed FOI in principle, saying that a legal power to force ministers to disclose information would weaken ministers&#x27; accountability to Parliament.

They worked to keep FOI on the political agenda until the climate became more favourable, while seeking to introduce specific rights to information through private members&#x27; bills. Several private members&#x27; bills that the Campaign drafted and promoted reached the statute book as the:

* Access to Personal Files Act 1987 (access to individuals&#x27; housing and social work files)
* Access to Medical Reports Act 1988 (access to medical reports provided to employers or insurers)
* Environment and Safety Information Act 1988 (access to specified enforcement notices)
* Access to Health Records Act 1990 (a general right of access to health records)

The Campaign also drafted a bill to reform section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, a catch-all provision which made the unauthorised disclosure of any official information a criminal offence. The Protection of Official Information Bill, introduced by MP Richard Shepherd in 1988, would have replaced section 2 with a narrower measure that included a public interest defence. The bill was defeated after the government imposed an unprecedented three-line whip on its own MPs at second reading requiring them to vote it down. Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government later introduced the Official Secrets Act 1989, which repealed section 2 of the 1911 Act, but rejected all efforts to insert a public interest defence.

In February 1993, another of the Campaign&#x27;s private members&#x27; bills for a full FOI Act, the Right to Know Bill, was introduced by MP Mark Fisher and debated for a total of 21 hours in the Commons.

With the whistleblowing charity Public Concern at Work the Campaign drafted the Whistleblower Protection Bill, introduced as a ten-minute rule bill by MP Tony Wright early in 1995. A revised version, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill, was introduced by MP Don Touhig at the end of 1995. The bill completed its committee stage in the Commons before being talked out by the government in 1996. Shortly after the Labour Party won the 1997 general election, MP Richard Shepherd drew a high place in the private members&#x27; ballot and introduced the Public Interest Disclosure Bill, which received Royal Assent in July 1998.

=== 1996–2005 ===

In 1996, Tony Blair presented the Campaign&#x27;s annual awards, and strongly committed himself to FOI. Following Labour&#x27;s election in 1997, the Campaign&#x27;s chairman James Cornford was appointed a special adviser by David Clark, the cabinet minister responsible for drawing up the government&#x27;s FOI proposals. However, after a well-received white paper, Your Right to Know (CM 3818), Clark was relieved of this role and responsibility for FOI was moved to the Home Office under Jack Straw. The Home Office later published a draft FOI bill that was greeted with &quot;universal hostility&quot;.

The Campaign took the lead in proposing amendments to the bill during its Parliamentary passage. It played a similar role in relation to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act, which received Royal Assent in 2002.

The Campaign&#x27;s role in bringing about FOI was acknowledged by Straw, who as Home Secretary introduced the legislation. Straw told MPs on the Justice Committee, which was conducting post-legislative scrutiny of the FOI Act, that Labour&#x27;s manifesto commitment &quot;was the product of a brilliant campaign by the Campaign for Freedom of Information&quot;. The commentator Peter Riddell wrote that the Campaign &quot;was primarily responsible for the introduction of the legislation&quot;.

=== 2005 onwards ===

Since 2005 the Campaign has worked to defend the FOI Act from repeated attempts to weaken it. These started in 2006, when the government published draft regulations to make it easier for public authorities to refuse FOI requests on cost grounds. This was followed by separate moves to remove Parliament and then MPs&#x27; expenses from the legislation. There was also pressure to exclude cabinet papers from access, exclude all policy discussions and to introduce charges for requests. The Campaign has opposed all these so far unsuccessful initiatives – though in 2010 a measure giving the Royal Family greater protection from FOI was passed.

The Campaign continues to press for improvements to the FOI Act. In particular to:
* ensure that FOI applies to contractors providing public services
* introduce tighter time limits for responding to requests and for them to be enforced more effectively
* extend the Act&#x27;s public interest test to the &#x27;absolute&#x27; exemptions
* allow requesters to specify that they want access to actual copies of documents not just the information in them
* extend the 6 month time limit within which the Information Commissioner can prosecute authorities which deliberately destroy requested records – the Government agreed to this change in 2012, but it has not yet been implemented.
Examples raised by the Campaign of contracting situations which fall outside the scope of FOI legislation were referred to by John Hemming MP when he introduced a proposed amendment to the FOI Act covering public authorities&#x27; contractors and sub-contractors in 2014. He referred to the enquiries about parking tickets issued, and then cancelled on appeal, by traffic wardens employed by a council contractor and who were offered incentives to issue tickets, the qualifications of assessors who were employed by a contractor to verify that incapacity benefit claims have been properly administered, and the cost of providing television and telephone connections for prisoners in a privately managed prison. Hemming echoed Frankel&#x27;s view that every outsourcing contract &quot;reduces the public&#x27;s access to information because of [this] loophole in the FOI Act&quot;.

==Support work==

The Campaign provides advice to the public about their rights to information and has published a short guide to the Freedom of Information Act and related laws. It assists individuals who have been refused information to complain to the Information Commissioner or appeal against Information Commissioner decisions to the Information Rights Tribunal. It has been instrumental in a number of successful Tribunal appeals involving the police&#x27;s failure to provide information to a murder victim&#x27;s family, relatives denied information about a hospital death, toxic land contamination, the withholding of an MP&#x27;s policy correspondence on the spurious grounds that disclosure would breach his privacy, and in overturning a decision that would have introduced an entirely new layer of secrecy about Ombudsman inquiries. It has assisted a requester bring a judicial review of a ministerial veto blocking the release of a report on the HS2 rail link.

The organisation recently intervened in two Supreme Court cases, with the Media Legal Defence Initiative in support of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful argument that Article 10 of the ECHR incorporates a right to FOI and in support of The Guardian&#x27;s challenge to the government&#x27;s use of the 
ministerial veto in the FOI Act to block the disclosure of the then Prince 
Charles&#x27; advocacy correspondence, the so-called Black spider memos, with government departments.

The Campaign provides training on how to use FOI. It also provides a regular training course for FOI officers on recent developments in FOI case law.

==30th anniversary==
In January 2015, the Campaign celebrated its 30th anniversary with an event hosted by ARTICLE 19 at the Free Word Centre at which Ian Hislop and Des Wilson spoke. It marked the occasion by selling special edition T-shirts featuring Tony Blair (who has described the introduction of FOI as one of his biggest mistakes) in a cartoon designed for it by political cartoonist Steve Bell.

==In fiction==

The character Sir Arnold Robinson from the hit series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; accepts the chairmanship of the campaign for freedom of information, and in &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; is regularly seen in this role, more often than not using it to aid Sir Humphrey in leaking material that will damage the government (once he has the assurance that the leaked information is inaccurate).

<text>William Mastrosimone (born August 19, 1947) is an American playwright and screenwriter from Trenton, New Jersey. He attended high school at The Pennington School and received a graduate degree in playwriting from Mason Gross School of the Arts, a part of Rutgers University.

His plays include &quot;The Woolgatherer&quot;, &quot;Extremities&quot;, &quot;Shivaree&quot;, and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Paw&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Bang Bang You&#x27;re Dead,&quot; which was once able to be downloaded from the Internet and performed by students for free. Other plays include &quot;The Afghan Women&quot; and &quot;Nanawatai&quot;, upon which the film &quot;The Beast&quot; is based. Two recent plays are &quot;Sleepwalk&quot;, a story again focusing on the traumas of modern teenage life, and &quot;Dirty Business&quot;, a play about a party girl caught between the mafia and the newly elected President of the United States.

Mastrosimone&#x27;s first play was &quot;The Woolgatherer&quot; which premiered at Rutgers Theatre Company in New Jersey of 1979

His screenwriting credits include, &quot;With Honors&quot;, &quot;Into the West&quot; and the adaptation of his play &quot;Extremities&quot;. He won 2 Daytime Emmy Awards for &quot;Bang, Bang You&#x27;re Dead&quot; and was nominated for a Prime Time Emmy for &quot;Into the West&quot; and &quot;The Burning Season&quot;.

His play &quot;Bang Bang You&#x27;re Dead&quot; is being toured by &#x27;Playground Theatre Project&#x27; with students from Actor&#x27;s Playground School of Theatre (in NJ), directed by Ralph Colombino, based in the Tri-State Area. This company goes to middle schools, high schools, and universities to prevent violence.

<doc id="544529" wikidata="Q7522054" url="?curid=544529" title="Sinclair Stevens">
<text>Sinclair McKnight Stevens (February 11, 1927 – November 30, 2016) was a Canadian lawyer, businessman and cabinet minister.

==Early life==
He was born in Esquesing Township (today part of Halton Hills, Ontario), the third child of Northern Irish immigrants Robert Murray Stevens and Anna Bailey McKnight. The family later moved near Kleinburg, Ontario.

He attended Weston Collegiate Institute and later, the University of Western Ontario, class of 1950. He was active in the student newspaper and the model Parliament. He entered Osgoode Hall Law School, where he met his fellow student and future wife Noreen Mary Terese Charlebois. Noreen was one of just five women in their class. They graduated in 1955 and married in 1958. From his university days until he articled, he was a part-time reporter for the Toronto Star. Stevens articled with Toronto law firm Fraser &amp; Beatty. He later formed his own firm Stevens, Hassard &amp; Elliot.

==Early career==
In 1958, his first development, The Cardiff, was under way. That was followed up with several other development projects.

In 1962, he formed York Trust and Savings Co. Former Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne became chairman in 1963. Stevens had interests in several other small trust companies. Unusually for the time, his branches were located in working-class areas and Loblaws stores, featuring extended service hours. York Trust grew at four times the rate of other trust companies.

By 1964 Stevens controlled 23 companies with assets of $130 million, having started in 1961 with just $215,000.

From 1963 to 1967 Stevens, was embroiled in an attempt to form the first new Canadian chartered bank in 50 years, Westbank. That caused resentment in several quarters. Westerners saw it as yet another eastern-controlled firm, Conservatives were put off by the association with Coyne, and the feathers of the establishment banks were ruffled. The affair led to a falling-out with Coyne and later with businessman Marc Bienvenu. John Diefenbaker reportedly &quot;loathed&quot; Stevens over the issue.

==Member of Parliament==
In 1968, he moved to King Township, Ontario. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 federal election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament, defeating Liberal incumbent cabinet minister John Roberts in the riding of York—Simcoe. 
He was re-elected in 1974. When his riding was abolished in 1979, Stevens was nominated in the new riding of York—Peel. He won again, and was re-elected in 1980, and 1984.

==Bid for PC leadership 1976==
Stevens ran as a candidate in the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. At the time, he had only three years parliamentary experience, but five of the other candidates had also entered parliament in 1972. He finished seventh (of eleven candidates) on the first ballot and withdrew in favour of the eventual winner Joe Clark. That was seen as a surprising move, since Stevens was considered right-wing, and Clark was a moderate on the party&#x27;s left wing. Mulroney would &quot;think about Steven&#x27;s dramatic walk for years to come, never pretending to understand it.&quot;

Stevens had been the top official campaign spender (at $294,107), but Mulroney, who did not provide figures, is widely thought to have exceeded that amount.

==Cabinet minister (1979–1980, 1984–1986)==
Stevens served as President of the Treasury Board in the short-lived (1979–1980) Clark government.

Stevens turned against Clark, and was an early supporter of Mulroney&#x27;s leadership bid which culminated in victory at the 1983 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. After the 1984 election, which resulted in a Tory landslide, Stevens became Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion.

==Conflict of interest allegations and Parker Commission==
As a cabinet minister, Stevens had placed his business holdings into a blind trust. He was forced to resign from Cabinet in 1986 after allegations of conflict of interest.

In December 1987, a special commission of inquiry, headed by Justice William Dickens Parker, ruled Stevens had violated conflict-of-interest allegations on fourteen counts. David Scott, brother of Ian Scott, as well as Marlys Edwardh were prominent lawyers involved in the commission, which cost more than $2.9 million. Edwardh had studied search and seizure, and the Parker commission was one of the first to make extensive use of subpoena. John Sopinka represented Stevens, and Ian Binnie represented Canada. The session lasted eight months, 93 witnesses were called, and nearly 14,000 pages of transcripts were recorded. 
Scott&#x27;s summation ran to 795 pages, Sopinka&#x27;s 346 pages.

Despite the controversy, Stevens was allowed to remain in the Progressive Conservative caucus as a backbencher for the remainder of his term, after which his riding was abolished and the constituency of York—Simcoe re-established. Stevens won the PC nomination in his original riding once again but Prime Minister Mulroney refused to sign his nomination papers, forcing the riding association to nominate another candidate. As a result of the bitter fight, Stevens left Parliament in 1988.

In December 2004, Federal Court Judge John O&#x27;Keefe declared null and void the findings of the Parker Inquiry. The court ruled that Parker&#x27;s definition of conflict of interest exceeded that of the guidelines governing ministers in the Mulroney Cabinet and that the step exceeded Parker&#x27;s mandate.

In voiding the definition of conflict of interest, the judge found that Stevens&#x27;s behaviour did not violate the guidelines that governed him since no valid guidelines had existed.

==Later life==
Stevens returned to prominence as a bitter opponent of the merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives into the Conservative Party of Canada. Stevens launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to try to block the merger. He later became a prominent member of the Progressive Canadian Party, which had been formed by Progressive Conservative members disaffected by the merger. In 2007, after Tracy Parsons&#x27;s resignation as leader of the &quot;new&quot; PC Party, Stevens succeeded Parsons as interim leader. Stevens remained in that position until his death, nine years later.

<doc id="544531" wikidata="Q56646" url="?curid=544531" title="Chinese hamster ovary cell">
<text>Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are a family of immortalized cell lines derived from epithelial cells of the ovary of the Chinese hamster, often used in biological and medical research and commercially in the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins. They have found wide use in studies of genetics, toxicity screening, nutrition and gene expression, and particularly since the 1980s to express recombinant proteins. CHO cells are the most commonly used mammalian hosts for industrial production of recombinant protein therapeutics.

==History==
Chinese hamsters had been used in research since 1919, where they were used in place of mice for typing pneumococci. They were subsequently found to be excellent vectors for transmission of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), facilitating &quot;Leishmania&quot; research.

In 1948, the Chinese hamster was first used in the United States for breeding in research laboratories. In 1957, Theodore T. Puck obtained a female Chinese hamster from Dr. George Yerganian&#x27;s laboratory at the Boston Cancer Research Foundation and used it to derive the original Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Since then, CHO cells have been a cell line of choice because of their rapid growth in suspension culture and high protein production.

The thrombolytic medication against myocardial infarction alteplase (Activase) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987. It was the first commercially available recombinant protein produced from CHO cells. CHO cells continue to be the most widely used manufacturing approach for recombinant protein therapeutics and prophylactic agents. 
In 2019, six of the 10 best selling drugs were made in CHO cells.

==Properties==
All CHO cell lines are deficient in proline synthesis. Also, CHO cells do not express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which makes them ideal in the investigation of various EGFR mutations.

Furthermore, Chinese hamster ovary cells are able to produce proteins with complex glycosylations, post-translational modifications (PTMs) similar to those produced in humans. They are easily growable in large-scale cultures and have great viability, which is why they are ideal for GMP protein production. Also, CHO cells are tolerant to variations in parameters, be it oxygen levels, pH-value, temperature or cell density.

Having a very low chromosome number (2n=22) for a mammal, the Chinese hamster is also a good model for radiation cytogenetics and tissue culture.
Being the first cell line to be used for recombinant pharmaceutical production, regulatory concerns were raised with respect to Endogenous Retroviral Sequences (ERS). CHO cells contain about 1000 of these sequences and some of them are able to direct the synthesis of Intracisternal A-type particles and C-type particles. Also, low expression of reverse transcriptase was observed. However the majority of ERS are defective (stop codons in all reading frames) and contain large deletions of a putative retroviral genome. 

==Variants==
Since the original CHO cell line was described in 1956, many variants of the cell line have been developed for various purposes. In 1957, CHO-K1 was generated from a single clone of CHO cells. According to an industry source, however, scientist Theodore Puck first isolated CHO-K1 in 1968. Puck and colleagues reported starting a cell line of Chinese hamster ovarian origin in 1957. Variants of K1 include the deposits in ATCC, ECACC, and a version adapted for growth in protein-free medium.

CHO-K1 was mutagenized in the 1970s with ethyl methanesulfonate to generate a cell line lacking dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity, referred to as CHO-DXB11 (also referred to as CHO-DUKX). However, these cells, when mutagenized, could revert to DHFR activity, making their utility for research somewhat limited. Subsequently in 1983, CHO cells were mutagenized with gamma radiation to yield a cell line in which both alleles of the DHFR locus were completely eliminated, termed CHO-DG44. These DHFR-deficient strains require glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine for growth. Cell lines with mutated DHFR are useful for genetic manipulation as cells transfected with a gene of interest along with a functional copy of the &quot;DHFR&quot; gene can easily be screened for in thymidine-lacking media. Due to this, CHO cells lacking DHFR are the most widely used CHO cells for industrial protein production.

More recently, other selection systems have become popular and with vector systems that can more efficiently target active chromatin in CHO cells, antibiotic selection (puromycin) can be used as well to generate recombinant cells expressing proteins at high level. This sort of system requires no special mutation, so that non-DHFR-deficient host cell culture have been found to produce excellent levels of proteins.

Since CHO cells have a very high propensity of genetic instability (like all immortalised cells) one should not assume that the names applied indicate their usefulness for manufacturing purposes. For example, the three K1 offspring cultures available in 2013 each have significant accumulated mutations compared to each other. Most, if not all industrially used CHO cell lines are now cultivated in animal component free media or in chemically defined media, and are used in large scale bioreactors under suspension culture. The complex genetics of CHO cells and the issues concerning clonal derivation of cell population was extensively discussed.

Much of the genetic manipulation done in CHO cells is done in cells lacking DHFR enzyme. This genetic selection scheme remains one of the standard methods to establish transfected CHO cell lines for the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins. The process begins with the molecular cloning of the gene of interest and the &quot;DHFR&quot; gene into a single mammalian expression system. The plasmid DNA carrying the two genes is then transfected into cells, and the cells are grown under selective conditions in a thymidine-lacking medium. Surviving cells will have the exogenous &quot;DHFR&quot; gene along with the gene of interest integrated in its genome. The growth rate and the level of recombinant protein production of each cell line varies widely. To obtain a few stably transfected cell lines with the desired phenotypic characteristics, evaluating several hundred candidate cell lines may be necessary.

The CHO and CHO-K1 cell lines can be obtained from a number of biological resource centres such as the European Collection of Cell Cultures, which is part of the Health Protection Agency Culture Collections. These organizations also maintain data, such as growth curves, timelapse videos of growth, images, and subculture routine information.

==Industrial use==
CHO cells are the most common mammalian cell line used for mass production of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, used in 70% of therapeutic mAbs. They can produce recombinant protein on the scale of 3–10 grams per liter of culture. Products of CHO cells are suitable for human applications, as these mammalian cells perform human-like post-translational modifications to recombinant proteins, which is key to the functioning of several proteins.

<text>Banaba (; formerly Ocean Island) is an island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean. A solitary raised coral island west of the Gilbert Island Chain, it is the westernmost point of Kiribati, lying east of Nauru, which is also its nearest neighbour. It has an area of , and the highest point on the island is also the highest point in Kiribati, at in height. Along with Nauru and Makatea (French Polynesia), it is one of the important elevated phosphate-rich islands of the Pacific.

== History ==
According to &quot;Te Rii ni Banaba (The Backbone of Banaba)&quot; by Raobeia Ken Sigrah, Banaban oral history supports the claim that the people of the Te Aka clan, which originated in Melanesia, were the original inhabitants of Banaba, having arrived before the arrival of later migrations from the East Indies and Kiribati. The name Banaba in the local Gilbertese language is correctly spelled &quot;Bwanaba&quot;, but the Constitution of Kiribati (12 July 1979) writes &quot;Banaba&quot;, meaning &quot;hollow land&quot;.

Settlement of Banaba began over 2,000 years ago, over the course of at least three waves of migration. Like the indigenous inhabitants of Nauru and Rapa Nui, Banaba was viewed as the &quot;buto&quot;, the navel or centre, of the world by the Banabans. Unlike other Pacific island societies, land on Banaba was held by individuals, rather than communally held by chiefs or aristocratic families. Several categories of both landholding and land-based transfers and transactions were recognized, including land for the aged, land for adopted children, land of marriage, and so on.

Sigrah makes also the controversial (and politically loaded) assertion that Banabans are ethnically distinct from other I-Kiribati. The Banabans were assimilated only through forced migrations and the heavy impact of the discovery of phosphate in 1900. 

Ocean Island had been hastily added to the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT) in 1900 to take advantage of the improved shipping connections resulting from the Pacific Phosphate Company&#x27;s increased activities. 

Prior to the deportation of its inhabitants at the end of World War II, there were four villages on the island: Ooma (Uma), Tabiang (Antereen), Tapiwa (Tabwewa) and Buakonikai. The local capital was Tabiang, now called Antereen.


The first known sighting of Banaba by Europeans occurred on 3 January 1801. Captain Jared Gardner of the American vessel &quot;Diana&quot; sighted the island. Then in 1804, Captain John Mertho of the convict transport and merchant ship &quot;Ocean&quot; sighted the island and named it after his vessel.

Whaling vessels often visited the island in the nineteenth century for water and wood. The first recorded visit was by the &quot;Arabella&quot; in March 1832. The last known visit was by the &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; in January 1904.

Banaba is prone to drought, as it is a high island with no natural streams and no water lens. The traditional source of water was a cave in which freshwater collected. A three-year drought starting in 1873 killed more than three-quarters of the population and wiped out almost all of the trees; many of those who survived left the island on passing ships to escape the drought, and only some were able to return, often years later.

=== Phosphate mining ===
The Pacific Islands Company, under John T. Arundel, identified that the petrified guano on Banaba consisted of high-grade phosphate rock. The agreement made with the Banabans was for the exclusive right to mine for 999 years for £50 a year. The terms of the licences were changed to provide for the payment of royalties and compensation for mining damage, amounting to less than 0.1% of the profits the PIC made during its first 13 years.

The Pacific Phosphate Company (PPC) built the Ocean Island Railway and mined phosphate from 1900 to 1919. In 1913, an anonymous correspondent to &quot;The New Age&quot; criticised the operation of the PPC under the title &quot;Modern buccaneers in the West Pacific&quot;. In 1919, the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand took over the operations of the Pacific Phosphate Company. The mining of the phosphate rock for fertiliser, which was carried out from 1900 to 1979, stripped away 90 per cent of the island&#x27;s surface, the same process which occurred on Nauru from 1907 to the 1980s. In June 1948, about 1,100 Gilbertese employed on Ocean Island refused to work; the key demand of the strikers was for higher wages of £10 a month to meet the increased price of goods sold in the trade store.

After 1945, the British authorities deported most of the population to Rabi Island, Fiji, with subsequent waves of emigration in 1977, and from 1981 to 1983. Some islanders subsequently returned, following the end of mining in 1979; approximately 300 were living on the island in 2001. The population of Banaba in the 2010 census was 295. Globally, there are an estimated 6,000 individuals of Banaban descent. On Rabi Island the names of settlements are the same authentic four names from Banaba Island.

Ocean Island Post Office opened on 1 January 1911 and was renamed Banaba around 1979.

In the 1970s, the Banabans sued in the Court of England and Wales claiming that the UK Crown owed a fiduciary duty to the islanders when fixing the royalty payments and the difference in proper rates should be paid. In &quot;Tito v Waddell (No 2)&quot; [1977] Ch 106, Sir Robert Megarry V-C held that no fiduciary duties were owed, because the term &quot;trust&quot; in the Mining Ordinance 1927 was not used in the technical sense, but rather in the sense of an unenforceable government obligation. The claim for the beach to be restored, from the 1948 agreement, was time-barred. The replanting obligations under the 1913 agreement were binding, but also they were limited to what was reasonably practicable.

=== World War II and Japanese occupation ===
In July 1941, Australia and New Zealand troops evacuated British Phosphate Commission employees from Banaba (then known as Ocean Island). In February 1942, the Free French destroyer &quot;Le Triomphant&quot; evacuated the remaining Europeans and Chinese. Japanese forces occupied the island from 26 August 1942 until the end of World War II in 1945. Cyril Cartwright, a member of the Gilbert and Ellice Colony administration, was subjected to ill-treatment and malnutrition. He died on 23 April 1943. Five Europeans also did not survive.

On 20 August 1945, the Japanese troops murdered all but one of the remaining 200 Banabans on Ocean Island. One man, Kabunare Koura, survived the massacre. On 21 August, the surrender of the 500 Japanese soldiers was accepted by Resident Commissioner, Vivian Fox-Strangways and Brigadier J. R. Stevenson, who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, the commander of the First Australian Army, on board the warship HMAS &quot;Diamantina&quot;. Two Japanese officers were put on trial and convicted for the deaths.

Given these conditions, the British Government deemed it impractical to return the Banabans to their island and decided to temporarily resettle the 280 Banabans who survived the war on Nauru and Truk were resettled on Rabi Island in Fiji. In December 1945, the Rabi Island Council was established, empowered to enact regulations, subject to the Governor of Fiji.

=== Post-1945 decolonisation period ===
==== Legal challenges ====
In 1947, the British Phosphate Commissioners negotiated with the Banabans of Rabi Island for the acquisition of the remaining economically workable land on Ocean Island. The High Commissioner refrained from participating in the negotiations, leaving the Banabans without needed knowledge and advice. The Banabans agreed to sell their land for £82,000 and a fixed royalty rate, unaware that the British Phosphate Commissioners operated as a non-profit entity, aimed at allowing Australian and New Zealand farmers to gain advantages from acquiring phosphates at prices below the market rate.

Sir Robert Megarry described the 1947 transaction as a &quot;major disaster&quot; for the Banabans. Despite later increases in royalty rates, resentment among the Banabans persisted, mostly due to the fact that royalties paid to the government of the Gilbert and Ellice Colony were higher than what they received. This general dissatisfaction along with the example of recently-independent island-nation Nauru led them demand independence for Ocean Island, however, these were not granted by the British, with concerns about revenue loss cited.

In 1968, the Banabans brought their case to the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonisation. Here, they garnered sympathy from committee members who urged the United Kingdom to take measures to improve the Banabans&#x27; situation, but refrained from supporting their plea for secession.

Simultaneously, the Banabans pursued legal action. In proceedings before the High Court in London, the Council of Leaders in Rabi Island, along with several Banaban landowners, alleged that the Crown held a fiduciary relationship with the Banabans. They claimed that in the 1931 and 1947 transactions, the Crown had breached this relationship due to a conflict of duty and interest. The claim of fiduciary relationship was dismissed by the Court, because the term &quot;trust&quot; in the Mining Ordinance 1927 was not used in the technical sense, but rather in the sense of an unenforceable government obligation. The claim for the beach to be restored, from the 1948 agreement, was according to the Court, time barred.

Sir Robert, however, who was highly reproachful of the British colonial administration, took the sides of the Banabans during the case, &quot;Ocean Island no. 1&quot;, which claimed that the British Phosphate Commissioners did not fulfil obligations under the 1913 agreement. The Commissioners were found liable for damages, but the plaintiffs were required to cover legal costs, which likely exceeded the awarded damages.

In 1977, a senior official, Mr. R.N. Posnett, was tasked with investigating financial and constitutional issues affecting the Banaban community&#x27;s future. After visiting the Gilbert and Rabi Island, Posnett recommended a $A 10 million &quot;ex-gratia&quot; payment from the British, Australian, and New Zealand governments to the Banabans.

Simultaneously, discussions about Banaba&#x27;s constitutional status within the Gilbert Islands occurred in London in July 1977 between the British Government and a Gilbert Islands delegation. The delegation aimed to maintain the territorial integrity of the Gilbert Islands while seeking agreement with the Banaban community. Although talks in London and later in Tarawa in October 1977, known as the Bairiki Resolutions, appeared promising, including the proposal for a UN-supervised referendum on the separation of Banaba from the Gilberts, the resolutions were never implemented.

==== Independence and Inclusion in the Republic of Kiribati ====
On 12 July 1979, the Gilbert Islands achieved complete independence from British colonial rule, marking the birth of the Republic of Kiribati. The term &quot;Kiribati&quot; is derived from the Gilbertese pronunciation of &quot;Gilberts&quot;. In this newly formed nation, Banaba was integrated as one of its islands. The historical context of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, characterised by Micronesian and Polynesian distinctions, posed challenges due to ethnic differences. The Ellice Islands adopted a &quot;separation before self-government&quot; strategy, leading to their constitutional independence in 1978 and the establishment of Tuvalu. Meanwhile, the Gilbert Islands, grappling with the intricate matter of Banaba islanders seeking secession, successfully navigated these complexities and emerged as the Republic of Kiribati in 1978, overcoming issues related to phosphate royalties and the resettlement of Banabans on Rabi Island in Fiji.

== Geography ==
The woodland of Banaba is now limited to the coastal area and is made up mostly of mangoes, flame trees, guavas, tapioca, and common Kiribati shrubs such as the saltbush. Having been mined for over 80 years, the centre of the island has no soil and is uninhabitable.

The village Buakonikai (&#x27;Te Aonoanne&#x27;) is now unoccupied. Banaba had three inhabited villages in the 2010 census; Tabwewa, Antereen (also called Tabiang) and Umwa.

=== Climate ===
Banaba Island features a tropical rainforest climate, under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification. Winds between north-east and south-east bring rainfall with large annual and seasonal variability. The period of lowest mean monthly rainfall starts in May and lasts until November. From December until April the monthly rainfall is on average higher than 120 mm.

=== Demography ===
At the census of 1931, when the production of phosphate was at its highest point, and the headquarters of the entire colony concentrated there, the total population of Ocean Island was of 2,607 inhabitants (1,715 Gilbertese; 65 Elliceans; 129 Europeans; 698 &quot;Mongoloids&quot; [Asians]. After World War II, at the census of 1947, just after relocation of Banabans on Rabi Island in 1945, there were 2,060 left (considering notably the massacre of Banabans at the end of the Japanese occupation). The new ethnic distribution was then the following: 1,351 Gilbertese (the main losses); 441 Polynesians (the main gain from overcrowded Ellice Islands); 138 Europeans; 112 &quot;Mongoloids&quot;; 11 &quot;half-caste&quot; European-Gilbertese; 2 &quot;half-caste&quot; European-Ellicean; 4 &quot;Gilbertese-Mongoloids&quot; and 1 &quot;other races&quot;.

At the end of World War II, the Gilbert Islands&#x27; (and Fiji&#x27;s) British colonial rulers decided to resettle most of Ocean Island&#x27;s population on Rabi Island, because of the ongoing devastation of Banaba caused by phosphate mining. Some have since returned, but the majority have remained on Rabi or elsewhere in Fiji. The Banabans came to Fiji in three major waves, with the first group of 703, including 318 children, arriving on the BPC vessel, &quot;Triona&quot;, on 15 December 1945. Accompanying them were 300 other Gilbertese. The Banabans had been collected from Japanese internment camps on various islands, mainly Nauru and Kosrae; they were not given the option of returning to Banaba, on the grounds that the Japanese had destroyed their houses – this was not true. Only 100 to 200 returned and represent the landowners that stay in Fiji.

The population was 2,706 in 1963, 2,192 in 1968, 2,314 in 1973 and 2,201 in 1978, the year before the end of phosphate exploitation. At the following census, in 1985, only 46 Banabans were living. With the return of some people from Rabi Island, they were 284 in 1990, 339 in 1995, 276 in 2000, 301 in 2005, 295 in 2010 and 268 in 2015. While only about 268 people live on Banaba, there is an estimated 6,000 people of Banaban descent in Fiji and other countries.

== Politics ==
Despite being part of Kiribati, its municipal administration is by the Rabi Council of Leaders and Elders, which is based on Rabi Island, in Fiji. Internationally, the Banaban community is often represented by the Banaban Community Presidium.

On 19 December 2005, Teitirake Corrie, the Rabi Island Council&#x27;s representative to the Parliament of Kiribati, said that the Rabi Council was considering giving the right to remine Banaba Island to the government of Fiji. This followed the disappointment of the Rabi Islanders at the refusal of the Kiribati Parliament to grant a portion of the A$614 million trust fund from phosphate proceeds to elderly Rabi islanders. Corrie asserted that Banaba is the property of their descendants who live on Rabi, not of the Kiribati government, asserting that, &quot;The trust fund also belongs to us even though we do not live in Kiribati&quot;. He condemned the Kiribati government&#x27;s policy of not paying the islanders.

On 23 December, Reteta Rimon, Kiribati&#x27;s High Commissioner to Fiji, clarified that Rabi Islanders were, in fact, entitled to Kiribati government benefits—but only if they returned to Kiribati. She called for negotiations between the Rabi Council of Leaders and the Kiribati government.

On 1 January 2006, Corrie called for Banaba to secede from Kiribati and join Fiji. Kiribati was using Banaban phosphate money for its own enrichment, he said; of the five thousand Banabans in Fiji, there were fewer than one hundred aged seventy or more who would be claiming pensions.

== Future prospects ==
The stated wish of the Kiribati government to reopen mining on Banaba is strongly opposed by many in the Banaban diaspora.

Some of the leaders of the displaced Banaban community in Fiji have called for Banaba to be granted independence. One reason given for the maintenance of a community on Banaba, at a monthly cost of F$12,000, is that if the island were to become uninhabited, the Kiribati government might take over the administration of the island, and integrate it with the rest of the country. Kiribati is believed to be anxious to retain Banaba, in the hope of mining it in the future. Like Kiritimati, it is a low-lying coral atoll but less susceptible to rising sea levels.

== Notable people ==
Science fiction and fantasy author Hugh Cook lived on Ocean Island for two years as a child and it was an influence on much of his work. &quot;When I was a small child – aged five and six, I think – I spent two years on Ocean Island, a dot in the Pacific Ocean near the equator. (Ocean Island is now called Banaba.) The Untunchilamon milieu has very much the flavor of Ocean Island – heat, flying fish, ghost crabs, red ants, scorpions, and the remnants of deceased military civilizations. (Ocean Island was littered with World War Two debris from the Japanese military occupation.)&quot;

Journalist Barbara Dreaver was born on Banaba and later moved to Tarawa and then New Zealand.

<doc id="544535" wikidata="Q724715" url="?curid=544535" title="Ranulf II of Aquitaine">
<text>Ranulf II (also spelled &quot;Rannoux&quot;, &quot;Rannulf&quot;, &quot;Ramnulf&quot;, and &quot;Ranulph&quot;) (850 – 5 August 890) was Count of Poitou from 866 and Duke of Aquitaine from 887. On the death of Charles the Fat in 888, he styled himself King of Aquitaine and did so until 889 or his death, after which the title fell into abeyance.

Ranulf was a son of Ranulf I and Adeltrude of Maine. He married an Ermengard (died 935) and by her had a son, Ranulf III of Poitiers, who succeeded him in Poitiers. His illegitimate son Ebalus succeeded him in Aquitaine and upon the death of Ranulf III, in Poitiers too.

Ranulf may have been selected as a king by the Aquitanian nobles, for they accepted King Odo of France in 892 only after Ranulf&#x27;s death. Only the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; definitively give him this title, saying &quot;Ranulf then set himself up as king&quot; (&quot;Deinceps Rannolfus se regem haberi statuit&quot;). He is recorded to have taken custody of Charles, the young son of Louis the Stammerer and he certainly did not recognise Odo as king. The &quot;Annales Vedastes&quot; record that in 889 
&quot;Post nativitatem vero Domini cum paucis Francis Aquitaniam perrexit, ut eos sibi sociaret. Quo audito, Ramnulfus, dux maximae partis Aquitaniae, cum sibi faventibus venit ad eum, adducens secum Karolum puerum, filium Hludowici regis; et iuravit illi quae digna fuerunt, simul et de ipso puerulo. . . Aquitanos itaque rex ex parte receptos, festinavit propter Nortmannos redire in Franciam.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
After Christmas [888], [Odo] went to Aquitaine with a few Franks, in order to be accepted [as king]. Upon hearing this, Ranulf, duke of the greater part of Aquitaine, with his supporters came to him, bringing with him the child, Charles, the son of King Louis; and he swore to him who was worthy of it [i.e., Odo], as did the boy... So the king returned from Aquitaine to France [in June] because of the Norsemen.
Ranulf founded the viscountcy of Thouars at about this time, as part of a larger movement to create viscounts with powers over regional fortresses to man them against the Vikings.

<text>Ebalus, or Ebles Manzer, or Manser ( 870 – 935), was Count of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine on two occasions: from 890 to 892; and then from 902 until his death in 935 (Poitou) and from 928 until 932 (Aquitaine).

==Early life==
Ebles was an illegitimate son of Ranulf II of Aquitaine. &quot;Manzer&quot;, or &quot;Mamzer&quot;, is a Hebrew word that means bastard, son of a forbidden relationship.

==Count of Poitou==
Upon the death of his father (who was poisoned), Ebles assumed his father&#x27;s mantle and acquired the role of Count of Poitou. But Ebles could not hold on to the title for long. Aymar, a descendant of one of Ranulf II&#x27;s predecessors, challenged Ebles&#x27; right to rule, as Ebles was merely a bastard son. In 892, Aymar, who was supported by Eudes of France, overthrew Ebles, and Ebles fled to the safety of his father&#x27;s allies, Count Gerald of Aurillac and William the Pious, count of Auvergne and Duke of Aquitaine. William the Pious had taken Ebles under his care and assured the boy&#x27;s education after the death of Ebles&#x27; father.

==Poitiers==
In 902, Ebles, with the assistance of William the Pious, a distant relative, conquered Poitiers while Aymar was away, and reestablished himself in his former position. Charles III, who knew Ebles as a childhood companion, then formally invested Ebles with the title, Count of Poitou. Ebles would hold this title until his death.

The comital title was the only one to which he ever had legitimate investiture. Ebles allotted the abbey of Saint-Maixent to Savary, Viscount of Thouars, who had been his constant supporter. He restructured Poitou by creating new viscounties in Aulnay and Melle and dissolved the title and position of Viscount of Poitou upon the death of its holder, Maingaud, in 925.

In 904, he conquered the Limousin.

==French commanders==
In 911 he, with two other French commanders were aligned in opposition to Rollo (future founder of Normandy), who had plundered the Northern French countryside. Ebles and the other two commanders intended to lead their armies in defense of the city of Chartres. Part of Rollo&#x27;s army camped on a hill (Mount-Levis) north of the city, while the rest were stationed on the plains outside Chartres.

==Battle==
On 20 July 911, the battle between the French and Danish armies commenced. &quot;Rollo and his forces were shamefully routed, smitten, as the legend tells, with corporeal blindness. A panic assuredly fell upon the heroic commander, a species of mental infirmity discernible in his descendants: the contagious terror unnerved the host. Unpursued, they dispersed and fled without resistance.&quot; At the end of the day, 6,800 Danes lay dead on the field of battle.

Ebles was somewhat slow in arriving at Chartres, so he was unable to &quot;take his due share in the conflict.&quot; His victorious partners proudly boasted of their success, and mocked Ebles and his tardy army. To redeem his honor and quiet the ridicule, Ebles accepted a challenge to confront the remnant of the Danish army that remained camped on the Mont-Levis. But instead of driving the Danes away, Ebles&#x27; army was defeated soundly. &quot;In the dark of the night, the Northmen, sounding their horns and making a terrible clamour, rushed down the mount and stormed&quot; Ebles camp. Ebles fled and hid in a drum in a fuller&#x27;s workshop. His cowardice and dishonor was derided in a popular French ballad of the Plantagenet age.

==Duke of Aquitaine==
When Ebles&#x27; benefactor, William the Pious, died, William was succeeded as Duke of Aquitaine by William the Younger. In 927, William the Younger died, and he left his title to his brother Acfred; but Acfred did not live even a year. Acfred made Ebles his heir, and in 928 Ebles assumed the titles Duke of Aquitaine, Count of Berry, Count of Auvergne, and Velay.

In 929, King Rudolph started trying to reduce the power of Ebles. He withdrew from him access to Berry, then in 932 he transferred the titles of Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Auvergne to the Count of Toulouse, Raymond Pons. Moreover, the territory of La Marche, which was under the control of the lord of Charroux, vassal of Ebles, was transformed into an independent county.

==Marriage and issue==

Ebles&#x27; first wife was Aremburga, whom he married before 10 October 892. His second wife was Emilienne, whom he married in 911. Following Emilienne&#x27;s death in 913/915, Ebles remarried to an Adele. Some 19th-century English historians identified Adele with Ælfgifu, daughter of Edward the Elder, known to have married &quot;a prince near the Alps&quot;, but there is nothing to support this identification. She has also been called Adela, Alaine, or Aliana.

Ebalus had one child by Emilienne, and another one by Adele:

* William III of Aquitaine married Gerloc, daughter of Rollo of Normandy
* Ebalus, Bishop of Limoges and Treasurer of St. Hilary of Poitiers.

<text>William I (22 March 875 – 6 July 918), called the Pious, was the Count of Auvergne from 886 and Duke of Aquitaine from 893, succeeding the Poitevin ruler Ebalus Manser. He made numerous monastic foundations, most important among them the foundation of Cluny Abbey on 11 September 910.

==Life==
William was son of Bernard Plantapilosa and Ermengard. Sometime before 898, William married the Bosonid Angilberga, daughter of Boso of Provence and Ermengard of Italy.

By inheritance, William was the ruler of Auvergne and the Limousin. He conquered Poitou and Aquitaine in 893 on behalf of Ebalus Manser. He kept the latter for himself and was proclaimed duke. His possessions extended from Austrasia to Toulouse and included the Autunois and Mâconnais.

In 909, William founded the Benedictine abbey of Cluny that would become an important political and religious centre. William required no control over the abbey, which he arranged should be responsible directly to the pope (see Clunian reforms). This was especially striking since most monasteries were privately owned and the appointment of abbots and officials was left to that family or individual, leading to the appointment of untrained and unordained abbots and officials. William also nominated Cluny&#x27;s first abbot, Berno of Baume.

A sign of William&#x27;s independence of rule in Aquitaine is that he had a &quot;deniers&quot; minted in his own name at Brioude. He was buried in the monastery of Saint-Julien. William had no sons of his own and was succeeded by a nephew, William the Younger, son of his sister Adelinda by Acfred I of Carcassonne.

==Marriage and issue==
William married Engelberga, daughter of Boso of Provence and Ermengard they had:
*Engelberga 
*Possibly another daughter

<text>William II the Young (died 12 December 926) was the Count of Auvergne and Duke of Aquitaine from 918 to his death, succeeding his uncle William I.

William was son of the Acfred I of Carcassonne and Adelinde, William I&#x27;s sister and Bernard Plantapilosa&#x27;s daughter. Immediately after succeeding his uncle, he made war on the Burgundians and Normans, who refused to accept Rudolph as king of France. His support of the king, however, was insincere. He later revolted and Rudolph led an army into Aquitaine, but was called back to defend the Rhine from the Magyars. William died soon after.

In 924 the duke Raoul of Burgundy came up to the Loire river and William was forced to make his submission to him. Upon which Raoul, relieved that such a powerful vassal accepted his suzerainty, gave him back the counties of Berry and Macon and the town of Bourges.

<text>Acfred (died 927) was briefly Count of Auvergne and Duke of Aquitaine between 926 and his death, succeeding his brother William II. Acfred was the youngest son of the count Acfred I of Carcassonne and Adelinda, sister of William I of Aquitaine. He was the last direct heir of his house. His title of &quot;duke&quot; only appears in a posthumous charter of 928.

Acfred possessed very little land in Auvergne, most of it having been transformed into allods of the leading men long before. Based on surviving charters, he did not control the Lyonnais or the Velay, though he held some property in the latter. His other property was scattered throughout the Auvergne and Gévaudan. He did, however, possess a few comital castles. When Acfred drew up a will in 927, he granted away all that remained of the comital fisc to his retainers.

Though Adhemar of Chabannes called Ebalus Manzer his successor, no contemporary documents evidence Ebalus in Auvergne, though he certainly had a claim to it. Ebalus, however, was not the only claimant. Between 940 and 941, Raymond Pons of Toulouse controlled the region, and, in 955, William III of Aquitaine invaded and held it.

<text>William III (913 – 3 April 963), called Towhead (, ) from the colour of his hair, was the &quot;Count of the Duchy of Aquitaine&quot; from 959 and Duke of Aquitaine from 962 to his death. He was also the Count of Poitou (as William I) from 935 and Count of Auvergne from 950. The primary sources for his reign are Ademar of Chabannes, Dudo of Saint-Quentin, and William of Jumièges.

William was son of Ebalus Manzer and Emilienne. He was born in Poitiers. He claimed the Duchy of Aquitaine from his father&#x27;s death, but the royal chancery did not recognise his ducal title until the year before his own death.

Shortly after the death of King Rudolph in 936, he was constrained to cede some land to Hugh the Great by Louis IV. He did it with grace, but his relationship with Hugh thenceforward deteriorated. In 950, Hugh was reconciled with Louis and granted the duchies of Burgundy and Aquitaine. He tried to conquer Aquitaine with Louis&#x27;s assistance, but William defeated them. Lothair, Louis&#x27;s successor, feared the power of William. In August 955 he joined Hugh to besiege Poitiers, which resisted successfully. William, however, gave battle and was routed.

After the death of Hugh, his son Hugh Capet was named Duke of Aquitaine, but he never tried to take up his fief, as William reconciled with Lothair.

He was given the abbey of Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand, which remained in his house after his death. He also built a library in the palace of Poitiers.

==Family background, marriage and issue==
His father was duke Ebles Manzer, who already was a man in his middle years when William was born in about 913. According to the chronicle of Ademar de Chabannes, William&#x27;s wife was Geirlaug (French: &quot;Gerloc&quot;, also known as Adèle), a daughter of Rollo of Normandy. The less reliable Dudo of Saint-Quentin has William rather than Ebles marrying Gerloc, perhaps about 936, in a match that may have been arranged by William I of Normandy.

With Gerloc, William had at least one child whose filiation is clearly attested:
* William, his successor in Aquitaine. He abdicated to the abbey of Saint-Cyprien in Poitiers and left the government to his son.
* Adelaide, who married Hugh Capet

<text>William IV ( 937 – 3 February 994), called Fierebras (meaning &quot;Proud Arm&quot;, from the French &quot;Fier-à-bras&quot; (which means Proud-to-Arm), in turn from the Latin &quot;Ferox brachium&quot;) (which means A Fierce Arm), was the Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou from 963 to his retirement in 990.

William&#x27;s father, William III, abdicated to the abbey of Saint-Cyprien in Poitiers and left the government to Fierebras. His mother was Gerloc, the daughter of Duke Rollo of Normandy. His sister was Adelaide, wife of Hugh Capet, the king against whom William later battled for his duchy. His early reign was characterised by many wars. He fought frequently against the counts of Anjou, the first time against Geoffrey Greymantle, who had taken Loudun.

In 988, he went to war with the newly elected king of France, Hugh Capet, whom he refused to recognise. Capet had been granted Aquitaine by King Lothair before the latter had been reconciled to William&#x27;s father. Capet renewed his claim on the great duchy and invaded it that year. A royal army was defeated on the plain of the Loire Valley. William sheltered the young Louis, the son of Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, the last legitimate Carolingian heir. He opened the palace of Poitiers to him and treated him as royalty, regarding him as the true heir to the French throne.

In 968, he married Emma, daughter of Theobald I of Blois and Luitgarde of Vermandois. Their marriage was stormy, in part because of William&#x27;s indulgence in the pursuit of women and, as a hunting aficionado, wild animals. She banished his paramours, they separated twice for long periods, and finally he retired to a monastery, as his father had done, leaving Emma to rule Aquitaine in the name of their son William until 1004. Their second son, Ebles, died sometime after 997.

<doc id="544544" wikidata="Q382339" url="?curid=544544" title="William V, Duke of Aquitaine">
<text>William the Great (; 969 – 31 January 1030) was duke of Aquitaine (as ) and count of Poitou (as or III) from 990 until his death. Upon the death of the emperor Henry II, he was offered the kingdom of Italy but declined to contest the title against Conrad II.

== Life ==
He was the son and successor of William IV by his wife Emma of Blois, daughter of Theobald I of Blois. He seems to have taken after his formidable mother, who ruled Aquitaine as regent until 1004. He was a friend to Bishop Fulbert of Chartres, who found in him another Maecenas, and founded a cathedral school at Poitiers. He himself was very well educated, a collector of books, and turned the prosperous court of Aquitaine into the learning centre of Southern France.

Though a cultivated prince, he was a failure in the field. He called upon his suzerain Robert II of France to aid in subduing his vassal, Boso of La Marche. Initially unsuccessful, Boso was eventually chased from the duchy. He had to contain Vikings who continually threatened his coast. In 1006, he was defeated by Viking invaders. He lost the Loudunais and Mirebalais to Fulk Nerra, count of Anjou. He had to give up Confolens, Ruffec, and Chabanais to compensate William II of Angoulême, but Fulbert negotiated a treaty (1020) outlining the reciprocal obligations of vassal and suzerain.

However, his court was a centre of artistic endeavour and he its surest patron. His piety and culture brought peace to his vast territories, and he tried to stem the tide of feudal warfare then destroying the unity of many European nations by supporting the current Peace and Truce of God movements initiated by Pope and Church. He founded Maillezais Abbey (1010) and Bourgueil Abbey. After a fire in Poitier, he rebuilt the cathedral and many other religious structures. He travelled widely in Europe, annually visiting Rome or Spain as a pilgrim. Everywhere he was greeted with royal pomp. His court was of an international flavour, receiving ambassadors from the Emperor Henry II, Alfonso V of León, Canute the Great, and even his suzerain, Robert of France.

Upon the death of Henry II without an obvious heir, some of the nobles of the kingdom of Italy looked for a separate candidate to elect rather than maintain their union with Germany by accepting its election of Conrad II. An embassy led by Ulric Manfred, the marquis of Susa, came to France in 1024 and remained for a year, attempting to interest Robert&#x27;s son Hugh Magnus and then (after Robert&#x27;s refusal to permit this) William, whose character and court impressed many. William considered the proposal seriously but, upon visiting Italy himself, he found the political situation so unfavorable that he renounced the crown for himself and his heirs. Most of his surviving six letters deal with the Italian proposal.

His reign ended in peace and he died on the last (or second to last) day of January 1030 at Maillezais, which he founded and where he is buried.

The principal source of his reign is the panegyric of Adhemar of Chabannes. His relations with his vassal, Hugh IV of Lusignan, are the subject of the &quot;Conventum&quot;.

==Family==
He was married at least 3 times. His first wife was Adalemode of Limoges, widow of Adalbert I of La Marche. They had:

# William VI, his successor

His second wife was Brisque of Gascony, daughter of Duke William Sánchez of Gascony and sister of Duke Sancho VI William. She was dead by 1018. They had:

# Odo, later duke of Gascony
His third wife was Agnes of Burgundy, daughter of Otto-William, Duke of Burgundy. Her second husband was Geoffrey II of Anjou. They had:

# Peter William, later duke as William VII
# Guy Geoffrey, later duke as William VIII
# Agnes (or Ala), married Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor (1043)

<text>William VI (1004 – March 1038), called the Fat, was Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou (as William IV) between 1030 and his death. He was the eldest son of William V the Great by his first wife, Adalmode of Limoges.

Throughout his reign, he had to face the hostility of his stepmother, Agnes of Burgundy, the third wife of his father, who had remarried to Geoffrey Martel, then count of Vendôme. He entered into a war with Martel, who pretended to the government of the Saintonge. On 20 September 1034, he was captured in the field at Moncontour, near Saint-Jouin-de-Marnes. He was freed in 1036, after nearly three years imprisonment, only by ceding the cities of Saintes and Bordeaux. He immediately reopened the war, but was defeated again and had to cede the isle of Oléron.

William married Eustachie of Montreuil but had no known descendants. He reformed the administration of Poitiers by naming a provost, and died there, being succeeded by his half-brother Odo. He was buried at Maillezais.

<text>Odo ( or &quot;Odon&quot;, ; c. 1010 – 10 March 1039/1040) was Duke of Gascony from 1032 and then Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou from 1038.

He was a member of the House of Poitiers, the second son of William V of Aquitaine, the eldest by his second wife Brisca, daughter of William II of Gascony.

The &quot;Chronicle of Saint-Maixent&quot; and Adhemar of Chabannes are the chief sources for his reign. He was subscribing donation charters to Saint-Cyprien with his father and mother and his brother Theobald, who died young, before 1018. He inherited Gascony in 1032 after the death of his uncle Sancho VI. In 1033, Odo took possession of the County of Bordeaux, traditional seat of the Gascon dukes.

At the death of his half-brother William VI in 1038, he succeeded as Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou. However, he was killed while asserting his rights in Poitou against his stepmother Agnes and his half-brother William VII. He died in battle at Mauzé defending his recently acquired title there. He was buried in the abbey of Saint-Pierre at Maillezais beside his father and brother.

<text>William VII (born Peter, &quot;Pierre-Guillaume&quot;) (1023 – autumn 1058), called the Eagle (&quot;Aigret&quot;) or the Bold (&quot;le Hardi&quot;), was the duke of Aquitaine and count of Poitou (as William V) between 1039 and his death, following his half-brother Odo.

William was the third son of William V of Aquitaine, the eldest by his third wife, Agnes of Burgundy. He was brother-in-law of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III, who married his sister Agnes. His mother remarried to Geoffrey Martel, Count of Anjou, during his reign. William won his patrimony in a war with his half-brother Odo, who was killed in battle at Mauzé. He did not, however, succeed in occupying Gascony.

Geoffrey Martel refused to concede to him the territories gained in the reigns of his predecessors. William set to work regaining his patrimony by force of arms. He was besieging Geoffrey in Saumur when he died of dysentery.

He was married to Ermesinde, of unknown origins. Two daughters have been hypothesized to be children of this couple: 
*Clementia, who married Conrad I of Luxembourg
*Agnes, who married Peter I of Savoy.

<text>William VIII ( – 25 September 1086), born Guy-Geoffrey (&quot;Gui-Geoffroi&quot;), was duke of Gascony (1052–1086), and then duke of Aquitaine and count of Poitiers (as William VI) between 1058 and 1086, succeeding his brother William VII (Pierre-Guillaume).

==Life==
Guy-Geoffroy was the youngest son of William V of Aquitaine by his third wife Agnes of Burgundy. He was the brother-in-law of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor who had married his sister, Agnes de Poitou.

He became Duke of Gascony in 1052 during his older brother William VII&#x27;s rule. Gascony had come to Aquitanian rule through William V&#x27;s marriage to Prisca (a.k.a. Brisce) of Gascony, the sister of Duke Sans VI Guilhem of Gascony.

William VIII was one of the leaders of the allied army called to help Ramiro I of Aragon in the Siege of Barbastro (1064). This expedition was the first campaign organized by the papacy, namely Pope Alexander II, against a Muslim town and stronghold in the Emirate of Zaragoza, and the precursor of the later Crusades movement. Aragon and its allies conquered the city, killed and enslaved its inhabitants and collected an important booty.

However, Aragon lost the city again in the following years. During William VIII&#x27;s rule, the alliance with the southern kingdoms of modern Spain was a political priority as shown by the marriage of all his daughters to Iberian kings.

==Marriage and children==
William married three times and had at least five children. After he divorced his first two wives, the first due to infertility, he married a third time to a much younger woman who was also his cousin Robert I of Burgundy&#x27;s daughter. This marriage produced a son, but William VIII had to visit Rome in the early 1070s to persuade the pope to recognize his children from his third marriage as legitimate.

*First wife: of Périgord, daughter of Count Aldabert II of Périgord (divorced November 1058), no children. She became a nun at Saintes.
*Second wife: Matoeda (divorced May 1068)
# Agnes, married Alfonso VI of Castile
*Third wife: Hildegarde of Burgundy (daughter of duke Robert I of Burgundy)

<text>Double Island or Wong Wan Chau () is an island located in the north-eastern part of Hong Kong. Administratively, it is part of North District.

==Geography==
Double Island has an area of 2.13 km². It is the second largest island in North District, the largest being Crooked Island. Its highest point is at 139 m. Its western coast is facing Double Haven.

Wong Wan () is a bay of Double Island. It is one of the 26 designated marine fish culture zones in Hong Kong.

==Conservation==
Double Island became part of the Plover Cove (Extension) Country Park in 1979.

==History==
===Typhoon of 1858===
It is wrongly suggested that it was the Double Island in Hong Kong&#x27;s Double Haven (Yan Chau Tong, ) where the September Typhoon of 1858 destroyed several well-known opium clippers, including the &quot;Anonyma&quot;, &quot;Gazelle&quot;, &quot;Pantaloon&quot;, and &quot;Mazeppa&quot;. Basil Lubbock&#x27;s &quot;The Opium Clippers&quot;, cited in the original entry, is quite clear (p.347) that the Double Island in question was that at what was then called Swatow (today Shantou). The island is one of two that lie in the entrance to the river at Shantou and is the inner one, then called Masu. Today it is called Mayu (). For corroboration see Mayers &amp; Dennys, for the identity of Double Island. For the typhoon and the damage to the vessels, &quot;The Courier&quot; (Hobart, Tasmania), 22 December 1858, p.3 for a report of Mr Midwood, of the Commissariat service, resident on Double Island during the typhoon.

<doc id="544552" wikidata="Q5351" url="?curid=544552" title="William IX, Duke of Aquitaine">
<text>William IX ( or , ; 22 October 1071 – 10 February 1126), called the Troubadour, was the Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and Count of Poitou (as William VII) between 1086 and his death. He was also one of the leaders of the Crusade of 1101. Though his political and military achievements have a certain historical importance, he is best known as the earliest troubadour—a vernacular lyric poet in the Occitan language—by whom some work survives.

==Ducal career==
William was the son of William VIII of Aquitaine by his third wife, Hildegarde of Burgundy. His birth was a cause of great celebration at the Aquitanian court, but the Church at first considered him illegitimate because of his father&#x27;s earlier divorces and his parents&#x27; consanguinity. This obliged his father to make a pilgrimage to Rome soon after his birth to seek Papal approval of his third marriage and the young William&#x27;s legitimacy.

===Early career, 1088–1102===
William inherited the duchy at the age of fifteen upon the death of his father. It has been generally believed that he was first married in 1088, at age sixteen, to Ermengarde, daughter of Fulk IV of Anjou. Biographers have described Ermengarde as beautiful and well educated, though suffering from severe mood swings. However, Ruth Harvey&#x27;s 1993 critical investigation shows the assumption of William&#x27;s marriage to Ermengarde to be based largely on an error in a nineteenth-century secondary source and it is highly likely that Philippa of Toulouse was William&#x27;s only wife. William married Philippa in 1094.

William invited Pope Urban II to spend the Christmas of 1095 at his court. The pope urged him to &quot;take the cross&quot; (i.e. the First Crusade) and leave for the Holy Land, but William was perhaps more interested in exploiting the absence on Crusade of Raymond IV of Toulouse, his wife&#x27;s uncle, to press her claim to Toulouse; on a more practical level, he also had no heir at that time. He and Philippa did capture Toulouse in 1098, an act for which they were threatened with excommunication. The Duchess was an admirer of Robert of Arbrissel, and persuaded William to grant him land in northern Poitou to establish a religious community dedicated to the Virgin Mary. This became Fontevraud Abbey, which would enjoy the patronage of their granddaughter Eleanor and would remain important until its dissolution during the French Revolution.

Likely motivated by many factors, religious as well as secular, William joined the Crusade of 1101, an expedition inspired by the success of the First Crusade in 1099. To finance it, he had to mortgage Toulouse back to Bertrand, the son of Raymond IV. William arrived in the Holy Land in 1101 and stayed there until the following year. His record as a military leader is not very impressive. He fought mostly skirmishes in Anatolia and was frequently defeated. His recklessness led to his being ambushed on several occasions, with great losses to his own forces. In September 1101, his entire army was destroyed by the Seljuk Turks led by Kilij Arslan I at Heraclea; William himself barely escaped, and, according to Orderic Vitalis, he reached Antioch with only six surviving companions. (See Army of William IX on the Crusade of 1101.)

===Conflict with Church and wife, 1102–1118===
William, like his father and many magnates of the time, had a rocky relationship with the Church. He was excommunicated twice, the first time in 1114 for an alleged infringement of the Church&#x27;s tax privileges. His response to this was to demand absolution from Peter, Bishop of Poitiers. As the bishop was at the point of pronouncing the anathema, the duke threatened him with a sword, swearing to kill him if he did not pronounce absolution. Bishop Peter, surprised, pretended to comply, but when the duke, satisfied, released him, the bishop completed reading the anathema, before calmly presenting his neck and inviting the duke to strike. According to contemporaries, William hesitated a moment before sheathing his sword and replying, &quot;I don&#x27;t love you enough to send you to paradise.&quot;

William was excommunicated a second time for &quot;abducting&quot; the Viscountess Dangereuse (&quot;Dangerosa&quot;), the wife of his vassal Aimery I de Rochefoucauld, Viscount of Châtellerault. The lady, however, appears to have been a willing party in the matter. He installed her in the Maubergeonne tower of his castle in Poitiers (leading to her nickname &quot;La Maubergeonne&quot;), and, as related by William of Malmesbury, even painted a picture of her on his shield.

Upon returning to Poitiers from Toulouse, Philippa was enraged to discover a rival woman living in her palace. She appealed to her friends at court and to the Church; however, no noble could assist her since William was their feudal overlord, and whilst the papal legate Giraud (who was bald) complained to William and told him to return Dangerose to her husband, William&#x27;s only response was, &quot;Curls will grow on your pate before I part with the Viscountess.&quot; Humiliated, Philippa chose in 1114 to retire to the Abbey of Fontevrault. She did not survive there long, however; the abbey records state that she died on 28 November 1118.

===Later career, 1118–1127===
Relations between the Duke and his elder son William also became strained—although it is unlikely that he ever embarked upon a seven-year revolt in order to avenge his mother&#x27;s mistreatment, as Ralph of Diceto claimed, only to be captured by his father. Other records flatly contradict such a thing. Ralph claimed that the revolt began in 1113; but at that time, the young William was only thirteen and his father&#x27;s liaison with Dangereuse had not yet begun. Father and son improved their relationship after the marriage of the younger William to Aenor of Châtellerault, Dangereuse&#x27;s daughter by her husband, Aimery I de Rochefoucauld, Viscount of Châtellerault, in 1121.

In October 1119, Orderic Vitalis reports that the Countess of Poitou, whom he refers to as &quot;Hildegarde,&quot; suddenly appeared at the Council of Reims being held by Pope Calixtus II and demanded that the Pope excommunicate William (again), oust Dangereuse from the ducal palace, and restore herself to her rightful place. The Pope postponed the case as William was not present to answer the charges. William was readmitted to the Church around 1120, after making concessions to it that may have included participating in the Reconquista efforts underway in Spain.

Between 1120 and 1123 William joined forces with the Kingdoms of Castile and León. Aquitanian troops fought side by side with Castilians in an effort to take Cordoba. During his sojourn in Spain, William was given a rock crystal vase by a Muslim ally that he later bequeathed to his granddaughter Eleanor. The vase probably originated in Sassanid Persia in the seventh century.

In 1122, William lost control of Toulouse, Philippa&#x27;s dower land, to Alfonso Jordan, the son and heir of Raymond IV, who had taken Toulouse after the death of William IV. He did not trouble to reclaim it. He died on 10 February 1126, aged 54, after suffering a short illness. His nickname, &quot;the Troubadour&quot;, was only applied in the nineteenth century. In contemporary documents, the only nickname he occasionally bears is &quot;the Younger&quot; to distinguish him from his father.

==Poetic career==
William&#x27;s greatest legacy to history was not as a warrior but as a troubadour—a lyric poet employing the Romance vernacular language called Occitan, or formerly Provençal.

He was the earliest troubadour whose work survives. Eleven of his songs survive (Merwin, 2002). The song traditionally numbered as the eighth (&quot;Farai chansoneta nueva&quot;) is of dubious attribution, since its style and language are significantly different (Pasero 1973, Bond 1982). Song 5 (&quot;Farai un vers, pos mi sonelh&quot;) has two significantly different versions in different manuscripts. The songs are attributed to him under his title as Count of Poitou (&quot;lo coms de Peitieus&quot;). The topics vary, treating sex, love, women, his own sexual and literary prowess, and feudal politics.

An anonymous 13th-century &quot;vida&quot; of William remembers him thus:

It is possible, however, that at least in part it is not based on facts, but on literal interpretation of his songs, written in first person; in Song 5, for example, he describes how he deceived two women.

In a striking departure from the typical attitude toward women in the period, William seems to have held at least one woman in particularly high esteem, composing several poems in homage to this woman, who he refers to as &quot;midons&quot; (master):

His frankness, wit, and vivacity caused scandal and won admiration at the same time. He is among the first Romance vernacular poets of the Middle Ages, one of the founders of a tradition that would culminate in Dante, Petrarch and François Villon. Ezra Pound mentions him in &quot;Canto VIII&quot;:

In &quot;Spirit of Romance&quot; Pound also calls William IX &quot;the most &#x27;modern&#x27; of the troubadours&quot;:

William was a man who loved scandal and no doubt enjoyed shocking his audiences. In fact, William granted large donations to the church, perhaps to regain the pope&#x27;s favour. He also added to the palace of the counts of Poitou (which had stood since the Merovingian era), later added to by his granddaughter Eleanor of Aquitaine and surviving in Poitiers as the Palace of Justice to this day.

One of William&#x27;s poems, possibly written at the time of his first excommunication, since it implies his son was still a minor, is partly a musing on mortality: &quot;Pos de chantar m&#x27;es pres talenz&quot; (&quot;Since I have the desire to sing,/I&#x27;ll write a verse for which I&#x27;ll grieve&quot;). It concludes:

Orderic Vitalis refers to William composing songs (c. 1102) upon his return from the Crusade of 1101. These might be the first &quot;Crusade songs&quot;:

==Family==
In 1094, William married Philippa, the daughter and heiress of William IV of Toulouse. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Saint-Maixent&quot;, William and Philippa had two sons and five daughters, although it does not name them. His eldest son was his eventual successor, William X. His second son, Raymond, eventually became the Prince of Antioch in the Holy Land. A daughter, Agnes, married, firstly, Aimery V of Thouars, and then King Ramiro II of Aragon.

Armenian sources, Basil the Doctor and Gregory the Priest, imply that Baldwin of Marash was a son of William and Philippa, born shortly before the latter&#x27;s retirement to a convent in 1114. Alternatively, he may have been an illegitimate son. Michael the Syrian reports that Reynald, Baldwin&#x27;s successor as lord of Marash, was his brother.

<text>Hei Ling Chau (Chinese: 喜靈洲), formerly Hayling Chau or Nai Gu Island, is an island of Hong Kong, located east of Silver Mine Bay and Chi Ma Wan of Lantau Island. Administratively, it is part of the Islands District.

==History==
The island was originally known as Nai Gu Island (). Settled at the end of the 19th century, it become home to about 100 people across 10 families by 1951. In 1950, it was designated as a leper colony, and the islanders were relocated to Tai Pak, Shap Long and Cheung Chau. In 1954, leprosarium was established through a collaboration between the Leprosy Mission London and the Hong Kong Government. The facility reach its peak in the early 1960s, housing as many as 540 patients. In 1974, the leper colony was closed, and the remaining patients were relocated to the newly established Lai Chi Kok Hospital. Following the closure of the colony, the island was repurposed by the Correctional Services Department.

In recognition of the island&#x27;s new purpose, the island was renamed to Hei Ling Chau, which translates to &quot;Island of Joyful Healing&quot;.

<doc id="544554" wikidata="Q453121" url="?curid=544554" title="William X, Duke of Aquitaine">
<text>William X (Occitan: &quot;Guillém X&quot;; 1099 – 9 April 1137), called the Saint, was Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, and Count of Poitou (as William VIII) from 1126 to 1137.

==Early life==
William was the son of William IX by his second wife Philippa of Toulouse. He was born in Toulouse during the brief period when his parents ruled the capital. His birth is recorded in the &quot;Chronicle of Saint-Maixent&quot; for the year 1099: (&#x27;a son was born to Count William, named William like himself&#x27;). Later that same year, much to Philippa&#x27;s ire, Duke William IX mortgaged Toulouse to Philippa&#x27;s cousin, Bertrand of Toulouse, and then left on crusade.
William and his mother, Philippa, were left in Poitiers. When his father, William IX returned from his unsuccessful crusade, he took up with Dangerose, the wife of a vassal, and set aside his rightful wife, Philippa. This caused strain between father and son until 1121 when William X married Aénor de Châtellerault, a daughter of his father&#x27;s mistress Dangerose by her first husband, Aimery. William succeeded to the duchy of Aquitaine in 1126.

==Marriage and issue==
William and Aénor had:
*Eleanor, who later became heiress to the Duchy and is best known to history as Eleanor of Aquitaine;
*Petronilla, who married Raoul I of Vermandois
*William Aigret, who died at age 4 in 1130, about the time his mother Aénor de Châtellerault died.

==Duke==
William administered his Aquitaine duchy as both a lover of the arts and a warrior. He became involved in conflicts with Normandy, which he raided in 1136 in alliance with Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou, who claimed it in his wife&#x27;s name and for France.

Even inside his borders, William faced an alliance of the Lusignans and the Parthenays against him, an issue resolved with total destruction of the enemies. In international politics, William X initially supported antipope Anacletus II in the papal schism of 1130, opposite to Pope Innocent II, against the will of his own bishops. In 1134, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux convinced William to drop his support for Anacletus and join Innocent.

==Conversion==

During St. Bernard&#x27;s time spent with William, he invited him to attend mass at the La Couldre church. During communion, Bernard went to the door with the Eucharist on the sacred paten and pointed the Host toward him and asked him not to look at God as he did his servants. 

In 1137, William joined the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, but died during the trip.

==Death== 
On his deathbed, he expressed his wish to see king Louis VI of France as protector of his fifteen-year-old daughter Eleanor, and to find her a suitable husband. Louis VI naturally accepted this guardianship and married the heiress of Aquitaine to his own son, Louis VII.

<text>John Allen Fraser (December 15, 1931 – April 7, 2024) was a Canadian politician who was speaker of the House of Commons from 1986 to 1994. He also served as Canada&#x27;s Minister of the Environment, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and Ambassador to the United Nations for the Environment.

==Life and career==
Fraser was born on December 15, 1931, in Yokohama, Japan, where his father was working as a lumber salesman. His parents returned to British Columbia when Fraser was four years old. He grew up and was educated there and graduated from the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in Spring 1954. Fraser first won a seat in Parliament in the 1972 general election as a Progressive Conservative from Vancouver. He stood as a candidate at the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention to replace Robert Stanfield, but did poorly and withdrew after the first ballot. He was re-elected in 1974, 1979, 1980, 1984, and 1988.

In 1979, Fraser became Minister of the Environment in the short-lived government of Joe Clark, returning to the Opposition benches in 1980. He returned to the Cabinet in the wake of Brian Mulroney&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1984 federal election and became Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He was forced to resign in 1985 as a result of the &quot;Tainted Tuna&quot; affair.

In 1986, he became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, the first to be elected by fellow Members of Parliament, and served in that capacity until his retirement from politics in 1993.

In January 1994, Fraser was appointed as Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations for the Environment, a post he served until December 1997.

Fraser died in Vancouver on April 7, 2024, at the age of 92.

==Honours==
In 1995, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2002, he was the recipient of the Vimy Award, which recognizes a Canadian who has made a significant and outstanding contribution to the defence and security of our nation and the preservation of our democratic values.

<text>Grass Island or Tap Mun is an island in Hong Kong, located in the northeastern part of the territory. Its area is . Administratively, it is part of the Tai Po District. There are about 100 people living on the island, and feral cattle are known on the island.
==Location==
Tap Mun is located in the northeastern part of the Hong Kong territory, between Mirs Bay and the North Channel. It lies north of the Sai Kung East Country Park on the Sai Kung Peninsula. To the east is Kung Chau, to the south is the South Channel, to the west is Wan Tsai and to the southwest is Long Harbour.

==History==
A tablet in the Tin Hau Temple on the island states Tap Mun, as part of Mirs Bay, was registered under the administration of the Dongguan County by the Tsui and Yip clans before 1573 and that they thus held the subsoil () rights as taxpayer under the Customary Land Law. By the late 17th century, Tanka fishermen began to use the anchorage and built the temple, the topsoil () rights being granted to them in perpetuity by the subsoil title holders. As a result of a dispute over the land that arose in the mid-18th century, the Magistrate and Prefect of the Dongguan County Court ruled that the Customary Land Law took precedence over the Imperial Law, thus preserving the subsoil:topsoil rights status quo (including the rule that, though the tax-paid land area of the subsoil holder was only the temple itself and its immediately vicinity, the rights of the topsoil holders extended automatically to all adjoining waste and mountainous land, i.e. the entire island). Over time, the first topsoil holder&#x27;s interest in the land will have passed to an ancestral trust of his family so that by the time of British colonial rule, the effective title holders in the topsoil will have been a trust of the villagers as a whole. The British refused to recognise all subsoil rights (their taxpaying status to the Imperial government being at odds with British sovereignty and its Crown land concept), leaving the only effective right in the land in the hands of the tenant topsoil rights holders, i.e. the village ancestral trust of the Tanka families.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Tap Mun was 253. The number of males was 168.

By the 1960s, the Tankas were living in wretched conditions on the island and, in response to their need, a charity from New Zealand funded the erection of a New Village to house them. The structures, considered an eyesore but functional, were completed in 1964 and continued in use as of 2016.

== Demographics ==
At its peak, Tap Mun had 2,000 residents. However, many moved to the city centre to live. Now many residents run stores or restaurants for local tourists visiting the island. The villagers are mostly farmers, merchants or fishermen. The latter category has recently diminished as many youths from fishing families have chosen to work in the city instead. Due to the population outflow, the last school on the island closed down in 2003.

==Administration==
Tap Mun is a recognised village under the New Territories Small House Policy.

== Attractions ==

=== Camping ===
The hilltop of Tap Mun is a popular camping site, renowned for the contrast in temperature and wind conditions between day and night. Temperatures drop and winds soar during the nighttime but die down as the day approaches, when the dawn marks the beginning of a temperature rise. It is also well known for providing panoramic views of the surrounding seas, and so provides a brief escape away from busy city life. The very gentle slopes of the hilltops are a favourite amongst campers, although there is the danger of the bordering cliffs.

===Temples===
The temple complex at Tap Mun comprises three temples in two buildings: the first building is a Tin Hau Temple, built in 1737, to which an annex was later added, housing a Kwan Tai Temple. To its south, Shui Yuet Kung (), built in 1788, is dedicated to Kwun Yam (Guan Yin) and the Earth God. The Tin Hau Temple is a Grade II historic building, while Shui Yuet Kung is listed as Grade III.

On festival days, such as Kwun Yam&#x27;s birthday, on the 19th day of the second lunar month, many fishermen arrive at Tap Mun to pray for peace and calm. The Tin Hau Festival () is celebrated annually on the 23rd day of the third lunar month. In addition, a marine parade is held once every ten years to celebrate the Tin Hau Festival. The temple at Grass Island is one of the two Tin Hau Temples in Hong Kong that have such a marine parade: the other one is the Tin Hau Temple on Leung Shuen Wan (High Island).

===Dining===
There is one seafood restaurant and a number of small tea restaurants on the Grass Island, many of which are known for &#x27;ice-less&#x27; ice-cold milk tea and boiled squid dishes. Some fishermen of Grass Island make a living by selling their sun-dried catch. Sun-dried fish and shrimp are popular amongst local tourists.

=== Other attractions ===

* Tap Mun Cave ()
* Layered Rock
* King Lam School () was founded before 1913 and was originally housed in the Tin Hau Temple. A dedicated school building with three classrooms was built on the hill in 1957. The school closed in the summer of 2003, due to the low number of students. It is now a Grade III historic building.
* Ngau See Dong, the grave site of a resident buffalo. The skeletal remains of the decomposed buffalo was a spooky sight as it was situated right next to a frequently walked stone path. Although now removed by local officials, the site can still be identified as an unnatural depression into the border of surrounding shrubs.
* The Environmental Protection Department has an Air Pollution Index monitoring station on the island.

==Climate==

==Transportation==
Grass Island is served by Tsui Wah Ferry Service. The ferry/kai-to services are available from:
# Wong Shek Pier in Sai Kung; about once every two hours, with higher frequency on weekends and holidays.
# Ma Liu Shui Pier near Chinese University in Tai Po; twice daily, with an extra departure on weekends and holidays.

<text>Joseph Pierre Albert Sévigny (; February 12, 1917 – March 20, 2004) was a Canadian soldier, author, politician, and academic. He is best known for his involvement in the Munsinger Affair.

==Life and career==
Born in Quebec City, Quebec, the son of Albert Sévigny, the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada in 1916, he graduated from Université Laval and Columbia University. He briefly attempted to pursue a career in acting, even being given a screen test by MGM in 1935, but instead returned to Canada to work in real estate, construction and in the import-export business. He also wrote fiction for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; under the pen name Peter Maple.

Sévigny served in the Canadian Army during World War II, and lost a leg in the Battle of the Rhineland. He was awarded the Virtuti Militari, Poland&#x27;s highest military decoration, for his involvement in the battle at Hill 262. Along with his Polish comrades of the 1st Polish Armoured Division, he denied access to Panzer divisions trying to break out of the Falaise pocket in August 1944. The action resulted in the encirclement and capture of 50,000 German troops. He also received France&#x27;s Croix de Guerre and Belgium&#x27;s Croix de Guerre. After the war he wrote a book &quot;Face à l&#x27;ennemi&quot; about his experiences. It won the Prix Ferrières de l&#x27;Académie française in 1948. In 1965, he wrote his second book, &quot;This Game of Politics&quot; for McClelland and Stewart.

He was elected to the House of Commons in the 1958 election, representing the electoral district of Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher, and served as Associate Defence Minister in the Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker. He was reelected in the 1962 election, but was defeated in the 1963 vote.

Sevigny was the father of Expo 67. Diefenbaker wrote in his memoirs: &quot;And it was to prepare for the celebration of our One Hundredth Birthday that my government set in motion the plans necessary to co-ordinate activities at every level across this country to make possible the grand and appropriate Centennial Celebrations of 1967. It was Senator Drouin and the Honourable Pierre Sevigny who first put forward the idea for Expo67 in Montreal. Marc Drouin was a man of ability who had an understanding of Canada as a whole, and I appointed him to the senate, where he served as Government Leader. His premature death was a great loss to Canada. I believe it was Colonel Sevigny who first asked me to do what I could to bring about Canada&#x27;s selection as the site for the international exposition of 1967...&quot;

During a routine investigation into a passport request from one Gerda Munsinger in 1960, it was discovered that her maiden name was Heseler and that she had been denied an immigration visa to visit Canada in 1952. It was also revealed that she had affairs with several important cabinet ministers in the Diefenbaker government. Sevigny was named in the report. The RCMP brought the report to the attention of Minister of Justice Davie Fulton who immediately showed it to Diefenbaker. Sevigny was called to explain his relationship. Diefenbaker instructed Sevigny to break off the liaison, and deemed the matter closed.

The affair resurfaced in 1966 when then Justice Minister Lucien Cardin (under Lester Pearson) was pressed to explain government action of the George Victor Spencer affair in the House of Commons by shouting out &quot;What about Monseignor&quot;. referring to Gerda Munsinger. The original file had been altered to reflect a security issue. It described Munsinger as being a prostitute and alleged spy and had remained under wraps for 17 months in Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s office. Cardin&#x27;s goal was to deflect the nation&#x27;s attention from the Dupuis, Favreau and Spencer scandals besetting Pearson&#x27;s weak leadership.

A Royal Commission, chaired by Justice Wishart Spence, was called by the government of Lester Pearson into the Munsinger Affair. The inquiry chastised Sévigny for his behavior and criticized Diefenbaker for leniency towards his Ministers, but absolved Sévigny of any guilt relating to any breach of security.

In 1967, he started teaching business administration at Concordia University, eventually becoming executive-in-residence in 1982. He retired in 1995, but returned two years later as a visiting assistant professor.

In 1971, he ran for the leadership of the provincial Union Nationale party. He placed last of four candidates on the first ballot, with 26 of the 1,205 votes cast, and was eliminated from subsequent ballots.

In 1978, Sévigny and Camil Samson founded the short-lived political party Les Démocrates in Quebec which became the Parti démocrate créditiste before dissolving after Samson left to join the Quebec Liberals and the party, led now by Sévigny, was unable to field a slate of 10 candidates and dissolved prior to the 1981 Quebec election.

Sévigny was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1994 during the tenure of Jean Chrétien.

He died in Montreal in 2004.

DuBois&#x27;s early television acting credits include the 1969 television film &quot;J.T.&quot; and as Loretta Allen on the soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot; from 1970 until 1972, becoming one of the first African-American female regular cast members on a daytime series. DuBois&#x27;s first film appearance was her portrayal of Vera in &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot; (1970). She landed the role of Stormy Monday in the 1973 comedy &quot;Five on the Black Hand Side&quot; and appeared in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;The Hot l Baltimore&quot; that same year.

During her time in the play, television producer Norman Lear watched DuBois on stage at the Mark Taper Forum and was impressed with her performance. He cast her in his CBS sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; as Wilona Woods, the Evanses&#x27; neighbor and best friend of family matriarch Florida Evans, portrayed by Esther Rolle. DuBois appeared in the show from February 1974 until the show ended in August 1979. DuBois began the show as a costar alongside Rolle and John Amos (who departed the show in 1976). In 1977, DuBois&#x27;s role became more prominent during the fifth season after Rolle had left the cast. DuBois returned to her costarring role when Rolle returned in the sixth and final season in 1978.

After &quot;Good Times&quot; ended in 1979, DuBois recorded the album &quot;Again, Ja&#x27;Net DuBois&quot; on her Peanuts and Caviar label in 1983. She appeared in former &quot;Good Times&quot; co-star Janet Jackson&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Control&quot; music video as her mother. In 1992, she costarred with Clifton Davis in &quot;And I Still Rise&quot;, a play written and directed by Maya Angelou. DuBois co-starred in the films &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot; (1988) and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), and on television in &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;

=== Other ventures and accolades ===
During the 1980s, DuBois operated the Ja&#x27;net DuBois Academy of Theater Arts and Sciences, a performing arts school for teenagers on Long Island, New York. In 1992, DuBois, Danny Glover and Ayuko Babu cofounded the Pan African Film &amp; Arts Festival in Los Angeles. In 1995, DuBois won a CableACE award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the Lifetime film &quot;Other Women&#x27;s Children&quot;. DuBois won Emmy Awards for her voiceover work on the animated program &quot;The PJs&quot; in 1999 and 2001. DuBois, along with the other cast members of &quot;Good Times&quot;, received the Impact Icon Award at the 2006 TV Land Awards. In 2000, DuBois served as grand marshal for the North Amityville Community Parade and Festival Day in Amityville, New York. DuBois was an honorary member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

== Personal life ==
DuBois married Sajit Gupta in 1950. According to her Brazilian consular document, DuBois was divorced from Gupta by April 1959, but another source states that she was still married in 1964. Together, DuBois and Gupta had four children: Provat Gupta, Rani Gupta, Kesha Gupta-Fields and Raj Kristo Gupta, who died of cancer in 1987 at age 36. Provat is a basketball coach based in California. In 1959, DuBois was romantically involved with actor Brock Peters.

<text>Ap Lei Chau or Aberdeen Island is an island of Hong Kong, located off Hong Kong Island next to Aberdeen Harbour and Aberdeen Channel. It has an area of after land reclamation. Administratively it is part of the Southern District. Ap Lei Chau is one of the most densely populated islands on earth, as well as the most densely populated island with a population of over 10,000.

In the 2000s on their website the Guinness World Records called it the world&#x27;s most densely populated island.

==History==
Before the First Opium War, Ap Lei Chau was a small fishing village, with its harbour forming an excellent natural typhoon shelter. The island appears on a Ming-era map with its primary settlement labelled &quot;Fragrant Harbour Village&quot;. This is the probable origin of the name for Hong Kong, although the town eventually took the name of its island.

Under the terms of the 1841 Treaty of Nanking, it was ceded to the British together with Hong Kong Island. It was sometimes known as Taplichan, Taplishan, &amp;c. from an alternative name for the island.

The island had a largely uneventful history under British rule.

In 1968, Hongkong Electric opened a power station on Ap Lei Chau to provide electricity for the whole of Hong Kong Island. In 1980 and 1994, a bridge was constructed to connect the island to the Hong Kong Island, and this created momentum for rapid economic development. Public housing estates were built to accommodate people, including some who had suffered in a fire in the Aberdeen typhoon shelter. In 1989, the generators of the power station were relocated to Lamma Island, and the old power station is still demolishing to this day. The nearby site was re-developed into the South Horizons residential area, with the addition of some land reclaimed from the sea.

==Geography and demographics==

Ap Lei Chau was named after the shape of the island, which resembles the tongue of a duck. &quot;Ap&quot; means &quot;duck&quot;, &quot;Lei&quot; means &quot;tongue&quot;, and &quot;Chau&quot; means &quot;island.&quot; The northern part has the highest population, while the southern part of the island is less densely populated.

The highest point on the island is Yuk Kwai Shan (玉桂山; aka. Mount Johnston), with an altitude of .

It comprises four main residential areas — Lei Tung Estate, Ap Lei Chau Main Street, South Horizons and Ap Lei Chau Estate, each of which comprises several highrise towers. There is an industrial estate on the southern tip of the island.

The population of Ap Lei Chau is 79,727. The sum of the population in constituency areas D02 to D07 and its area is , giving it a population density of and making it the fourth most densely populated island in the world.

Ap Lei Chau also lends its name to the Ap Lei Chau geologic formation, which covers most of Hong Kong Island.

==Places of interest==

The Hung Shing Temple located on Hung Shing Street, off Main Street, Ap Lei Chau, is a notable site. Dating back to 1773, it is the oldest temple in the Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau areas and is a declared monument.

The Shui Yuet Temple aka. Kwun Yum Temple is located at No. 181 Main Street, Ap Lei Chau. Dedicated to Kwun Yum, it was built at the end of the 19th century and is a Grade III historic building. The temple site is adjacent to the site of the former Aberdeen Police Station. Clearly chosen for its fung shui, the superior dragons were seen as being protection from the &#x27;threat of the tiger&#x27;s jaw&#x27; from the police station. Although the police station has now been demolished, the dragons are still present and seen as enduring feng shui guards. Apart from Kwun Yum, the temple also houses Kwan Tai, Tin Hau, Chai Kung and Wong Tai Sin.

==Transport==

Ap Lei Chau and Hong Kong Island are connected by the four-lane Ap Lei Chau Bridges. Opened in 1983, it originally only had two lanes, and was widened to four in 1994 with a duplicated bridge to the northwest of the original one.

Buses are the main form of transport for the residents in Ap Lei Chau. Bus routes depart from the six bus termini on the island to various places on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon:
* Ap Lei Chau Estate
* Ap Lei Chau (Lee Lok Street) and Ap Lei Chau (Lee King Street) in the industrial area
* Ap Lei Chau Main Street 
* Lei Tung Estate
* South Horizons

Green minibuses and taxis are available. Red minibuses are prohibited from entering the island.

There is a regular sampan service running between Ap Lei Chau Main Street and Aberdeen. (Service hours: 6am-12am)

The MTR South Island line opened on 28 December 2016 links Admiralty of Hong Kong Island to Ap Lei Chau by the Aberdeen Channel Bridge, to the southeast of the Ap Lei Chau Bridges. There are two stations on the island: Lei Tung (for Lei Tung Estate and Ap Lei Chau Main Street) and South Horizons (for South Horizons, Ap Lei Chau Estate and Ap Lei Chau Industrial Estate).

==Education==
Ap Lei Chau is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 18. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and Hong Kong Southern District Government
Primary School.

==Community issues==
Since Ap Lei Chau is currently the fourth most densely populated island in the world, public space is highly insufficient. In 2016, the Hong Kong Government reallocated the waterfront land of the former Hong Kong Driving School on Lee Nam Road for building luxury apartments, ignoring the suggestion of the locals and intensified the problem of insufficient land use. In February 2017, it was reported that the land, measuring , had been sold by tender for a record price of HK$16.86 billion (US$2.17 billion) to a venture between KWG Property and Logan Property Holdings.

<doc id="544571" wikidata="Q2567186" url="?curid=544571" title="Cruelty Free International">
<text>Cruelty Free International is a British animal rights and advocacy group that campaigns for the abolition of all animal testing. It organises certification of cruelty-free products which are marked with the symbol of a leaping bunny.

It was founded in 1898 by Irish writer and suffragette Frances Power Cobbe as the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. In 2012, the BUAV joined with the New England Anti-Vivisection Society to establish a new international organisation to campaign against the testing of cosmetics on animals—Cruelty Free International. This was launched by BUAV supporter Ricky Gervais. In 2015, the parent organisation merged into this new organization, taking its name and branding for all its activities.

==Background==
The BUAV was formed in response to the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) supporting restrictive legislative proposals under Stephen Coleridge. Frances Power Cobbe did not want the Society to promote any measure short of abolition so she founded BUAV on 14 June 1898 during a public meeting in Bristol.

Known at first as the British Union, or &quot;the Union&quot;, it campaigned against the use of dogs in vivisection, and came close to achieving success with the 1919 Dogs (Protection) Bill, which almost became law. Walter Hadwen was president and chaired meetings for BUAV. Its secretary was Beatrice E. Kidd. In 1929, BUAV had 91 branches including two in Australia. In 1949, the Worthing branch of BUAV had the largest membership in the country. President of the Worthing branch the Rev. Charles A. Hall stated that they had 1678 members and over 2000 new subscribers.

Tentative discussion toward amalgamation with the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS), during the early 1960s under NAVS&#x27;s Committee Secretary, Wilfred Risdon, could not be successfully concluded. During this period the president was Albert Belden. The president from 1972 to 1979 was Betty Earp.

In recent years, it successfully lobbied the British government into abolishing the oral test in the 1990s. The BUAV was also closely involved in the lobbying which led to the adoption in the European Union of the 7th Amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, which effectively banned both the testing of cosmetics products and their ingredients on animals and also the sale of products in the EU which have been animal-tested anywhere in the world.

==Focus==
In recent years, the organisation has focused on a number of new areas, including the promotion of non-animal tested products; the European Union&#x27;s REACH proposal to test tens of thousands of chemicals on millions of animals; and the use of non-human primates in experimentation. It acts as the secretariat of the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE), established in 1990, and its chief executive, Michelle Thew, acts as chief executive of the coalition.

It helps consumers to identify and purchase products that have not been tested on animals through its Humane Cosmetics and Humane Household Products Standards (HCS and HHPS). These are audited accreditation schemes for retail companies which confirm that neither their products nor their ingredients are tested on animals. These standards are also run in a number of European countries and in the United States. A list of approved companies is available and regularly updated on their website. It also runs a primate sanctuary in Thailand for 50 rescued macaques.

==Undercover investigations==
Undercover investigations included the exposure of the breeding and supply of monkeys from Nafovanny in Vietnam for experimentation in Europe and the US. and a contract testing laboratory in Germany operated by Fortrea. It pursued a judicial review against the Home Office as a result of its findings in the Cambridge investigation. The High Court ruled in support of the Government in three of the four issues, and in favour of the BUAV on one issue, though this was later overturned on appeal with the Home Office awarded costs. Other investigations in 2007 highlighted the primate trade from Malaysia and Spain.

<text>Tai A Chau is an uninhabited island of Hong Kong, part of the Soko Islands group, located south of Lantau Island. It is referred to as South Soko Island in some media articles.

==Geography==
With an area of 1.2 km², Tai A Chau is the largest of the Soko Islands. It is located 4.5 km to the south of Lantau Island and about 2 km north of the boundary of the Hong Kong territorial waters. The island has small hills with heights ranging from 85m to 154m. Its coastline is mainly steeply sloped and rocky in nature.

==Administration==
Tai A Chau is a recognized village under the New Territories Small House Policy.

==History==
There were historically two villages on the island: Ha Tsuen and Sheung Tsuen on the west and south sides of the island. The villagers left in the 1980s, when a detention camp for Vietnamese refugees was built. In 1937, Walter Schofield, then a Cadet Officer in the Hong Kong Civil Service, wrote &quot;There is a shrimp paste factory here which exports to Europe and America&quot;.

Tai A Chau Detention Centre was home to thousands of Vietnamese refugees from 1991 to 1996. It once held a peak population of almost 9,700 in November 1991. After the announcement of the closure of Tai A Chau refugee facility on 10 June 1996, the transfer of the remaining Vietnamese refugees took place on 10 consecutive days from 16 to 25 September 1996. Each day, one ferry loaded with luggage, and two ferries loaded with a total of about 550 Vietnamese refugees departed Tai A Chau for HMS Tamar naval base at Stonecutters Island. They were then moved to the notorious Whitehead Detention Centre in Wu Kai Sha, before immigrating to the US under their “Resettlement Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees Scheme”. This ensured the centre was closed just prior to the handover in 1997 and all the building structures were demolished.

In February 2023 the Hong Kong Police Force carried out a crowd control training exercise on the island, leaving hundreds of spent tear gas grenades and debris from other crowd control weapons on the protected South Lantau Marine Park site.

==Features==
The island has a temple dedicated to Tin Hau and seven earth shrines.

Two helicopter landing pads and a small jetty remain from the island&#x27;s former detention centre.

<doc id="544577" wikidata="Q559247" url="?curid=544577" title="Anna of East Anglia">
<text>Anna (or Onna; killed 653 or 654) was king of East Anglia from the early 640s until his death. He was a member of the Wuffingas family, the ruling dynasty of the East Angles, and one of the three sons of Eni who ruled the kingdom of East Anglia, succeeding some time after Ecgric was killed in battle by Penda of Mercia. Anna was praised by Bede for his devotion to Christianity and was renowned for the saintliness of his family: his son Jurmin and all his daughters – Seaxburh, Æthelthryth, Æthelburh and possibly a fourth, Wihtburh – were canonised.

Little is known of Anna&#x27;s life or his reign, as few records have survived from this period. In 631 he may have been at Exning, close to the Devil&#x27;s Dyke. In 645 Cenwalh of Wessex was driven from his kingdom by Penda and, due to Anna&#x27;s influence, he was converted to Christianity while living as an exile at the East Anglian court. Upon his return from exile, Cenwalh re-established Christianity in his own kingdom and the people of Wessex then remained firmly Christian.

Around 651 the land around Ely was absorbed into East Anglia, following the marriage of Anna&#x27;s daughter Æthelthryth. Anna richly endowed the coastal monastery at Cnobheresburg. In 651, in the aftermath of an attack by Penda on Cnobheresburg, Anna was forced to flee into exile, perhaps to the western kingdom of the Magonsæte. He returned to East Anglia in about 653, but soon afterwards the kingdom was attacked again by Penda and at the Battle of Bulcamp the East Anglian army, led by Anna, was defeated by the Mercians, and both Anna and his son Jurmin were killed. Anna was succeeded by his brother, Æthelhere. Botolph&#x27;s monastery at Iken may have been built in commemoration of the king. After Anna&#x27;s reign, East Anglia seems to have been eclipsed by its more powerful neighbour, Mercia.

==Sources==
The kingdom of East Anglia () was a small independent Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire Fens.

In contrast to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about the kingdom of the East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of its monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The main primary sources for information about Anna&#x27;s life and reign are the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna&#x27;s death. The mediaeval work known as the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, written in Ely in the twelfth century, is a source of information about Anna&#x27;s daughters, and also describes his death and burial.

==Early life and marriage==
Anna was the son of Eni, a member of the ruling Wuffingas family, and nephew of Rædwald, king of the East Angles from 600 to 625. East Anglia was an early and long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom in which a duality of a northern and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.

Anna was married; Bede refers to the saint Sæthryth as &quot;daughter of the wife of Anna, king of the East Angles&quot;. In Abbott Folcard&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Botolph&quot;, written in the 11th century, Botolph is described as having been at one time the chaplain to the sisters of a king, Æthelmund, whose mother was named Sæwara. Folcard names two of Sæwara&#x27;s kinsmen as Æthelhere and Æthelwold. Since these are the names of two of Anna&#x27;s brothers, Steven Plunkett suggests that it is &quot;tempting&quot; to consider that Sæwara was married to Anna, and that Æthelmund might either be Anna&#x27;s full name, or the name of an otherwise unknown East Anglian sub-king. 

The &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, on the other hand, names Hereswith, the sister of Hild, abbess of Whitby, as Anna&#x27;s wife and the mother of Sæthryth, Seaxburh of Ely and Æthelthryth. However, the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; is regarded with caution by historians: Rosalind Love says that the mediaeval writers who interpreted Bede&#x27;s information about Hereswith made an &quot;erroneous assumption&quot; regarding her connection with Anna and his family. Bede is clear that Hereswith had left East Anglia as a widow before Hild visited the kingdom, at which time Anna was very much alive. Historians now believe that Hereswith was Anna&#x27;s sister-in-law, and some have thought that around the time that she married into the East Anglian royal family, Anna had already been king for a decade.

In 631 Anna was probably at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, according to the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth is said to have been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred&#x27;s Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil&#x27;s Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.

==King of the East Angles==

===Accession and rule===
During 632 or 633 Edwin of Northumbria, with his centre of Christian power north of the River Humber, was overthrown. Edwin was slain and Northumbria was ravaged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, supported by the Mercian king, Penda. The Mercians then turned on the kingdom of the East Angles and their king, Ecgric. At an unknown date (possibly in the early 640s), they routed the East Anglian army and Ecgric and his predecessor Sigeberht were both slain. D. P. Kirby has suggested that as Sigeberht was alive when the Irish monk Fursey left for Gaul and found Erchinoald, (which happened after Erchinoald became Mayor of the Neustrian palace in 641), Sigeberht was probably killed around 640 or 641. Penda&#x27;s victory marked the end of the line of kings of the East Angles who were directly descended from Rædwald. Some time after Penda&#x27;s victory, Anna became king of the East Angles, though the date of his accession is quite uncertain. The &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; says that Anna died in the nineteenth year of his reign, and since he died in the mid-650s this would indicate a date around 635. However, the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; is regarded by some historians as unreliable on this point, and Barbara Yorke suggests a possible date in the early 640s for Anna&#x27;s accession, noting that it could not have been after 645 as Anna is recorded as giving refuge to Cenwalh of Wessex in that year. It is probable that Anna became king with the assistance of the northern Angles. Throughout his reign he was the victim of Mercian aggression under Penda, but he also seems to have challenged the rise of Penda&#x27;s power. Due to their rivalry for control over the Middle Anglian people, Mercia and East Anglia probably became hereditary enemies and Penda repeatedly attacked the East Angles from the mid-630s to 654.

Anna arranged an important diplomatic marriage between his daughter Seaxburh and Eorcenberht of Kent, cementing an alliance between the two kingdoms. It was by means of marriages such as this that the kings of Kent became well-connected to other royal dynasties. Not all of Anna&#x27;s daughters were married into other royal families. During the 640s Anna&#x27;s daughter Æthelburg and his stepdaughter Sæthryth entered Faremoutiers Abbey in Gaul to live religious lives under abbess Fara. They were the first royal Anglo-Saxons to become nuns, making religious seclusion &quot;an acceptable and desirable vocation for ex-queens and royal princesses&quot;, according to Barbara Yorke.

D. P. Kirby uses the presence of East Anglian princesses living under the veil in Gaul as evidence of the Frankish orientation of Anna&#x27;s kingdom at this time, continued since the reign of his predecessor Rædwald. The Wuffingas dynasty may have been connected with monastic foundations in the area around Faramoutiers through Anna&#x27;s predecessor Sigeberht, who had spent several years as an exile in Gaul and had become a devout and learned Christian due to his experiences of monastic life.
In 641 Oswald of Northumbria was slain in battle by Penda (probably at Oswestry in Shropshire). Due to his death, Northumbria was split into two. The northern part, Bernicia, accepted Oswald&#x27;s brother Oswiu as their new king, but the southern Deirans refused to accept him and were ruled instead by a king of the original Deiran house, Oswine. Soon afterwards Cenwalh of Wessex, the brother of Oswald&#x27;s widow and himself married to Penda&#x27;s sister, renounced his wife. In 645, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Penda drove Cenwalh from his kingdom and into exile. During the following year, while a refugee at Anna&#x27;s court, he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh&#x27;s return to his throne.

Anna&#x27;s hold on the western limits of his kingdom, which bordered on the Fen lands that surrounded the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in 651 (or slightly later) of his daughter Æthelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South Gyrwe, a people living in the fens who may have been settled in the area around Ely. Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.

===Exile===

During his reign Anna endowed the monastery at Cnobheresburg with rich buildings and objects. The monastery was built in about 633 by Fursey after he arrived in East Anglia. In time, weary of attacks on the kingdom, Fursey left East Anglia for good, leaving the monastery to his brother Foillan. When in 651 Penda attacked the monastery, Anna and his men arrived and held the Mercians back. This gave Foillan and his monks enough time to escape with their books and valuables, but Penda defeated Anna and drove him into exile, possibly to the kingdom of Merewalh of the Magonsætan, in western Shropshire. He returned to East Anglia in about 654.

===Death, burial place and successors===
Soon after 653, when Penda made his son Peada the ruler of the Middle Angles (but still continued to rule his own country), the Mercian assault on East Anglia was repeated. The opposing armies of Penda and Anna met at Bulcamp, near Blythburgh in Suffolk. The East Anglians were defeated and many were slain, including King Anna and his son Jurmin. Anna&#x27;s death is mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in the entry for 653 or 654, &quot; &quot;Her Anna cining werð ofslagen ...&quot; &quot; – &#x27;Here Anna was killed&#x27; – but no other details of the battle in which he died are given.
Blythburgh, a mile from Bulcamp and situated near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards believed to be the location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name &#x27;Bulcamp&#x27; indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.

Saint Botolph began to build his monastery at Icanho, now conclusively identified as Iken, Suffolk, in the year that Anna was killed, possibly to commemorate the king. Anna was succeeded in turn by his two brothers Æthelhere and Æthelwold, who may have ruled jointly. It is possible that Æthelhere was set up as a puppet ruler by Penda or was his ally, as he was one of the 30 &quot;duces&quot; that accompanied Penda when he attacked Oswiu of Northumbria at an unidentified location called the Winwæd in 655 or 656. Penda himself was killed at the Winwæd, after having steadily increased his power over a period of 13 years. Æthelhere (who was also slain at the Battle of the Winwæd) and Æthelwold were succeeded by the descendants of Anna&#x27;s youngest brother, Æthelric.

Bede praised Anna&#x27;s piety in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, and modern historians have since regarded Anna as a devout king, but his reputation as a devoted Christian is mainly because he produced a son and four daughters who were all made into Anglo-Saxon saints. Five hundred years after his death, his tomb at Blythburgh was (according to the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;) still &quot;venerated by the pious devotion of faithful people&quot;.

==Family==
Anna&#x27;s children were all canonised. The eldest, Seaxburh, was the wife of Eorcenberht of Kent. She ruled Kent from 664 until her son Ecgberht came of age. Æthelthryth, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, founded the monastery at Ely in 673. Another daughter, Æthelburh, spent her life at the nunnery of Faremoutiers. Anna&#x27;s son, Jurmin, was of warrior age in 653 when he was killed in battle.

By tradition, Anna is said to have had a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or possibly West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century &quot;Bosworth Psalter&quot;. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint&#x27;s body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh&#x27;s death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.

<text>The Nakajima G10N &quot;Fugaku&quot; (Japanese: 富岳 or 富嶽, &quot;Mount Fuji&quot;) was a planned Japanese ultra-long-range heavy bomber designed during World War II. It was conceived as a method for mounting aerial attacks from Japan against industrial targets along the west coast (e.g., San Francisco) and in the Midwest (e.g., Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, and Wichita) and the northeast (e.g., New York City and Norfolk) of the United States. Japan&#x27;s worsening war situation resulted in the project&#x27;s cancellation in 1944 and no prototype was ever built.

==Design and development==
The Fugaku had its origins in &quot;Project Z (bomber project)&quot;, a 1942 Imperial Japanese Army specification for an intercontinental bomber which could take off from the Kuril Islands, bomb the contiguous United States, then continue onward to land in German-occupied France. Once there, it would be refueled and rearmed and make another return sortie.

Project Z called for three variations on the airframe: heavy bomber, transport (capable of carrying 300 troops), and a gunship armed with forty downward-firing machine guns in the fuselage for intense ground attacks at the rate of 640 rounds per second (i.e. 38,400 rounds per minute).

The project was conceived by Nakajima Aircraft Company head Chikuhei Nakajima. The design had straight wings and contra-rotating four-blade propellers. To save weight, some of the landing gear was to be jettisoned after takeoff (being unnecessary on landing with emptied bomb load), as had been planned on some of the more developed German &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; competing designs. It used six engines, as with the later &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; design competitors, to compensate for nearly all German aircraft engines being limited to 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) maximum output levels apiece.

Development was initiated in January 1943 and a design and manufacturing facility built in Mitaka, Tokyo. Nakajima&#x27;s 4-row 36-cylinder 5,000 hp Ha-54 (Ha-505) engine was abandoned as too complex.

Project Z was cancelled in July 1944, and the &quot;Fugaku&quot; was never built.

==Operators (planned)==
*Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service – (G10N / Fugaku)
*Imperial Japanese Army Air Force – (Project Z)

<text>The Basketball Diaries is a 1978 memoir written by author and musician Jim Carroll. 

== Description ==
It is an edited collection of the diaries he kept between the ages of twelve and sixteen. Set in New York City, they detail his daily life, sexual experiences, high school basketball career, poetry compositions, the counterculture movement, and especially his addiction to heroin, which began when he was 13.

== Adaptation ==
The book was made into a film of the same name in 1995 starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jim Carroll and Mark Wahlberg as Mickey. Roger Ebert noted in his 1995 review of the adaptation that Carroll&#x27;s original memoir &quot;struck a personal note, of a kid who despite his suffering tried to turn his experience into poetry&quot;.

== Sequels ==
Carroll followed up this memoir with a sequel of sorts called &quot;The Downtown Diaries&quot; which follows his relocation to California and his efforts to end his heroin addiction.

<text>Pedigree Petfoods is a subsidiary of the American group Mars Inc. specializing in pet food, with factories in England at Melton Mowbray and Birstall, Leeds; and offices at McLean, Virginia.

==History==
In 1934, Mars Limited, a division of the large American confectionery company, that had been based in Slough since 1932, acquired Chappel Brothers in Manchester. This company took low-quality meat and canned it as dog food, branded as &quot;Chappie&quot;.

New dog food brands Pal and Lassie were introduced during the 1950s.

===Mars Inc.===
In 1968, Mars took over Kal Kan Foods of Los Angeles.

In 1988, Kal Kan Foods changed the name of its dog food to Pedigree, the name Mars used to sell dog food outside the United States. The next year, Mars applied their worldwide branding of Whiskas to their cat food branding.

In 1998, Kal Kan was the top-selling dog food brand but was going downhill. In the United States, its Pedigree Select brand became Cesar, used in Europe and Asia.

==The Pedigree Foundation==
In the United States, The Pedigree Foundation is a philanthropic organization dedicated to helping shelter dogs find permanent homes. The foundation, created in 2008, provides grants to 501(c)(3) dog shelters and breed rescue organizations, and help dog lovers adopt, volunteer, and make donations. According to the foundation&#x27;s FAQ site, it has raised more than $4 million to date. In 2008, it distributed more than $1.1 million in grant money to more than 500 shelters and breed rescues. Use of awarded grant money by qualified recipients is virtually unrestricted, but is most often used for shelter improvements or veterinary care.

<text>Tung Ping Chau () is an island in Hong Kong, part of Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark. It is also known as Ping Chau (). &quot;Tung&quot; (, meaning &quot;east&quot;) is prepended to the name at times so as to avoid possible confusion with &quot;Peng Chau&quot;, another island in Hong Kong with an identically pronounced name in Cantonese. Administratively, the island is part of the Tai Po District in the New Territories.

==Geography==
Geographically, Ping Chau is an offshore island located in the northeast corner of Hong Kong in Mirs Bay, close to the border with Guangdong Province in mainland China. The island has an area of 1.16 km2 and consists of shale rock. The island is the most easterly point of the Hong Kong territory and is much closer to mainland China (4 km) than to the main landmass of Hong Kong. It is close to Nan&#x27;ao of Dapeng.

The island has the shape of a kidney bean with its concave side facing northeast. Its name &quot;Ping Chau&quot; means &quot;flat island&quot; in Chinese. The highest points on the island are in the south and in the north. The eastern inner shore of the crescent hugs Ping Chau Hoi () with a few beaches, including Cheung Sha Wan () in the northeast. In contrast, the western coast of the island is fairly rocky as a result of the greater wave action taking its toll on the inclined siltstone there.

The island&#x27;s largest village, Sha Tau (), is something of a ghost town, with many cottages boarded up. A large part of the island is country parkland, with footpaths overgrown with orchids, wild mint and morning glory.

==History==
Ping Chau has a checkered history. Guns and opium were once smuggled from here, and during the Cultural Revolution many mainlanders swam in hopes of reaching Ping Chau and the freedom of Hong Kong.

The now virtually deserted island was once home to a thriving fishing and farm community of 3,000 people, with over 100 fishing junks. Historical villages of Ping Chau included the five oldest: Chau Mei (), Chau Tau (), Nai Tau (), Sha Tau () and Tai Tong (), as well as five other smaller family villages, which were subsequently developed: Chan Uk (), Lam Uk (), Lei Uk (), Tsau Uk () and Tsoi Uk (). The village of Chau Mei was settled by fishermen who sold their catch at Tai Po Market and at Shayuchong (), a coastal village now part of the Longgang District of Shenzhen.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (1941–1945), Ping Chau was used as a logistics base for the supply of military resources, including petrol, to the Chinese army. Several allied military leaders were transported to the mainland via the island.

In the 1950s, there were about 1,500 people living in the ten villages on the island. Two primary schools were built: Kwan Ying School () in Tai Tong and Wai Sun School () in Chau Tau. At that time, the economy of the island deteriorated due to the depletion of fishery resources and the termination of trade with the mainland as a consequence of the Korean War (1950–1953). During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), political turmoil cut off commerce with the mainland and most villagers moved away. By the early 1970s, only a few elderly people remained on the island. In 2004, the last permanent resident moved out of Tung Ping Chau. Some may return on weekends. In 2013, the District Offices estimated that Tung Ping Chau had a population of 8.

==Villages==
The villages of Ping Chau Chau Mei (), Ping Chau Chau Tau (), Ping Chau Nai Tau (), Ping Chau Sha Tau () and Ping Chau Tai Tong () are recognized villages under the New Territories Small House Policy.

==Geology==
Ping Chau is unique in the fact that it is the only sizeable island in Hong Kong made up of sedimentary rock. Hong Kong is mostly formed of extrusive igneous rocks, after a series of major volcanoes erupted during the Jurassic Period. Following the volcanic activity, a basin formed in the northeast, with deposition in a brackish lake—producing the siltstones and chert of Tung Ping Chau, which have been dated from the early Paleogene period. It is also home to some spectacular cliffs and wave-cut platforms. Landforms such as these are very rarely found in the rest of Hong Kong.

Cham Keng Chau (斬頸洲, &quot;Chop Neck Islet&quot;), in the northwest, is a chunk of land that has broken away from the island; the Chinese say it represents the head of a dragon. Another notable rock formation is Lung Lok Shui (龍落水, &quot;Dragon Descend into Water&quot;), on the southwestern coast, thus named because it resembles the spine of a dragon entering the sea. At the island&#x27;s southeastern end are two large rocks known as the Drum Rocks, or Kang Lau Shek (更樓石, &quot;Watchman&#x27;s Tower Rocks&quot;). They are sea stacks on a wave-cut platform. Lan Kwo Shui (難過水, &quot;Difficult-to-cross Waters&quot;) features a long vertical cliff located along the southern coast, where several caves were formed there as a result of long term wave actions. Lan Kwo Shui can be reached by foot from Kang Lau Shek, at low tide and in calm sea conditions.

== Demographics ==
In the 1950s and 1960s, about 2000 were estimated to live on the island. Over the years the number of residents has dwindled to a mostly elderly population of about 50–60 total people. Many early residents of Ping Chau were from Shantou (Swatow) and they kept the tradition of worshiping Tam Kung after they settled on the island. The island even had its own dialect, the Ping Chao dialect. Nowadays no longer spoken by many, you may still hear this dialect in the conversations between the villagers inside the restaurants.

==Tourism==
The island has a temple dedicated to Tin Hau, built in 1765, and a temple dedicated to Tam Kung: the Tam Tai Sin Temple (), built before 1877. Both temples are located in the village of Sha Tau. Several other old buildings can be found on the island. On one side of the island there are steep cliffs, below which is an amazing wave-cut platform, with jagged rocks, set at a 30-degree angle, like a staircase. Here there are many rock pools containing all manner of marine life, such as sea urchins and crabs. On the island&#x27;s coastline at the pier side, there are over 60 different species of coral, and 35 species of algae.

During the weekends, many people visit the island. These include those who have come to dive and those who have come to see the cliffs and wave-cut platforms. Some people also use it as a weekend home. 57,000 people visited Ping Chau in 2005.

There is a camping site as well as picnic and barbecue sites on the island, managed by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. A few basic restaurants can be found at Tai Tong, a short distance north of Tung Ping Chau Public Pier. Basic dorms are available at Tai Tong Wan () and A Ma Wan ().

==Conservation==

Three buildings of Ping Chau are listed as Grade III Historic Buildings: the Tin Hau Temple, the Tam Tai Sin Temple, both in the village of Sha Tau, and the Old House, built in the 1940s in Chau Mei by Lee 
Mou-you ().

Ping Chau has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1979.

With the exception of an area of old villages along its east coast, Ping Chau is part of the Plover Cove (Extension) Country Park, designated in 1979.

The Tung Ping Chau Marine Park was designated in 2001 as the fourth Marine Park in Hong Kong. It occupies a sea area of about 270 hectares which encloses the island of Ping Chau.

Ping Chau is one of the eight Geo-Areas of the Hong Kong Global Geopark, which was inaugurated in November 2009.

==Transportation==
The island is reachable by ferry from Ma Liu Shui ferry pier, near the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The landing point is the Tung Ping Chau Public Pier (), the only public pier on Ping Chau, located near the centre of the island at Wong Ye Kok (). Improvement works on the pier were completed in 2007. The ferry service is operated by Tsui Wah Ferry on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays only. The journey takes 1 hour 40 minutes.

<text>In engineering, a requirement is a condition that must be satisfied for the output of a work effort to be acceptable. It is an explicit, objective, clear and often quantitative description of a condition to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.

A specification or spec is a set of requirements that is typically used by developers in the design stage of product development and by testers in their verification process. 

With iterative and incremental development such as agile software development, requirements are developed in parallel with design and implementation. With the waterfall model, requirements are completed before design or implementation start.

Requirements are used in many engineering fields including engineering design, system engineering, software engineering, enterprise engineering, product development, and process optimization. 

Requirement is a relatively broad concept that can describe any necessary or desired function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, user, or other stakeholder. 

== Origins of term ==
The term &quot;requirement&quot; has been in use in the software engineering community since at least the 1960s.

According to the &quot;Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge®&quot; version 2 from IIBA (BABOK), a requirement is:
# A condition or capability needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
# A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a solution or solution component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents.
# A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2).
This definition is based on IEEE 610.12-1990: IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology.

== Product versus process requirements ==
Requirements can be said to relate to two fields:
* Product requirements prescribe properties of a system or product.
* Process requirements prescribe activities to be performed by the developing organization. For instance, process requirements could specify the methodologies that must be followed, and constraints that the organization must obey.

Product and process requirements are closely linked; a product requirement could be said to specify the automation required to support a process requirement while a process requirement could be said to specify the activities required to support a product requirement. For example, a maximum development cost requirement (a process requirement) may be imposed to help achieve a maximum sales price requirement (a product requirement); a requirement that the product be maintainable (a product requirement) often is addressed by imposing requirements to follow particular development styles (e.g., object-oriented programming), style-guides, or a review/inspection process (process requirements).

== Types of requirements ==
Requirements are typically classified into types produced at different stages in a development progression, with the taxonomy depending on the overall model being used. For example, the following scheme was devised by the International Institute of Business Analysis in their Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (see also FURPS and Types of requirements).

; Architectural requirements
: Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary integration of system structure and system behavior, i.e., system architecture of a system.
: In software engineering, they are called architecturally significant requirements, which is defined as those requirements that have a measurable impact on a software system’s architecture.

; Business requirements
: High-level statements of the goals, objectives, or needs of an organization. They usually describe opportunities that an organization wants to realise or problems that they want to solve. Often stated in a business case.

; User (stakeholder) requirements
: Mid-level statements of the needs of a particular stakeholder or group of stakeholders. They usually describe how someone wants to interact with the intended solution. Often acting as a mid-point between the high-level business requirements and more detailed solution requirements.

; Functional (solution) requirements
: Usually detailed statements of capabilities, behavior, and information that the solution will need. Examples include formatting text, calculating a number, modulating a signal. They are also sometimes known as &quot;capabilities&quot;.

; Quality-of-service (non-functional) requirements
: Usually detailed statements of the conditions under which the solution must remain effective, qualities that the solution must have, or constraints within which it must operate. Examples include: reliability, testability, maintainability, availability. They are also known as &quot;characteristics&quot;, &quot;constraints&quot; or the &quot;ilities.&quot;

; Implementation (transition) requirements
: Usually, detailed statements of capabilities or behavior required only to enable the transition from the current state of the enterprise to the desired future state, but that will thereafter no longer be required. Examples include recruitment, role changes, education, migration of data from one system to another.
;Regulatory requirements
: Requirements defined by laws (Federal, State, Municipal, or Regional), contracts (terms and conditions), or policies (company, departmental, or project-level).

== Characteristics of good requirements ==
The characteristics of good requirements are variously stated by different writers, with each writer generally emphasizing the characteristics most appropriate to their general discussion or the specific technology domain being addressed. However, the following characteristics are generally acknowledged.


There are many more attributes to consider that contribute to the quality of requirements. If requirements are subject to rules of data integrity (for example) then accuracy/correctness and validity/authorization are also worthy attributes. Traceability confirms that the requirement set satisfies the need (no more - and no less than what is required).

To the above some add Externally Observable, that is, the requirement specifies a characteristic of the product that is externally observable or experienced by the user. Such advocates argue that requirements that specify internal architecture, design, implementation, or testing decisions are probably constraints, and should be clearly articulated in the Constraints section of the Requirements document. The contrasting view is that this perspective fails on two points. First, the perspective does not recognize that the user experience may be supported by requirements not perceivable by the user. For example, a requirement to present geocoded information to the user may be supported by a requirement for an interface with an external third party business partner. The interface will be imperceptible to the user, though the presentation of information obtained through the interface certainly would not. Second, a constraint limits design alternatives, whereas a requirement specifies design characteristics. To continue the example, a requirement selecting a web service interface is different from a constraint limiting design alternatives to methods compatible with a Single Sign-On architecture.

=== Verification ===
All requirements should be verifiable. The most common method is by test. If this is not the case, another verification method should be used instead (e.g. analysis, demonstration, inspection, or review of design).

Certain requirements, by their very structure, are not verifiable. These include requirements that say the system must &quot;never&quot; or &quot;always&quot; exhibit a particular property. Proper testing of these requirements would require an infinite testing cycle. Such requirements must be rewritten to be verifiable. As stated above all requirements must be verifiable.

Non-functional requirements, which are unverifiable at the software level, must still be kept as a documentation of customer intent. However, they may be traced to process requirements that are determined to be a practical way of meeting them. For example, a non-functional requirement to be free from backdoors may be satisfied by replacing it with a process requirement to use pair programming. Other non-functional requirements will trace to other system components and be verified at that level. For example, system reliability is often verified by analysis at the system level. Avionics software with its complicated safety requirements must follow the DO-178B development process.

Activities that lead to the derivation of the system or software requirements. Requirements engineering may involve a feasibility study or a &quot;conceptual analysis phase&quot; of the project and requirements elicitation (gathering, understanding, reviewing, and articulating the needs of the stakeholders) and requirements analysis, analysis (checking for consistency and completeness), specification (documenting the requirements) and validation (making sure the specified requirements are correct).

Requirements are prone to issues of ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency. Techniques such as rigorous inspection have been shown to help deal with these issues. Ambiguities, incompleteness, and inconsistencies that can be resolved in the requirements phase typically cost orders of magnitude less to correct than when these same issues are found in later stages of product development. Requirements analysis strives to address these issues.

There is an engineering trade off to consider between requirements which are too vague, and those which are so detailed that they

* take a long time to produce - sometimes to the point of being obsolete once completed
* limit the implementation options available
* are costly to produce

Agile approaches evolved as a way of overcoming these problems, by baselining requirements at a high-level, and elaborating detail on a just-in-time or &quot;last responsible moment&quot; basis.

== Documenting requirements ==
Requirements are usually written as a means for communication between the different stakeholders. This means that the requirements should be easy to understand both for normal users and for developers. One common way to document a requirement is stating what the system must do. Example: &#x27;The contractor must deliver the product no later than xyz date.&#x27; Other methods include use cases and user stories.

== Changes in requirements ==
Requirements generally change with time. Once defined and approved, requirements should fall under change control. For many projects, requirements are altered before the system is complete. This is partly due to the complexity of computer software and the fact that users don&#x27;t know what they want before they see it. This characteristic of requirements has led to requirements management studies and practices.

== Issues ==

=== Competing standards ===
There are several competing views of what requirements are and how they should be managed and used. Two leading bodies in the industry are the IEEE and the IIBA. Both of these groups have different but similar definitions of what a requirement is.

=== Disputes regarding the necessity and effects of software requirements ===
Many projects have succeeded with little or no agreement on requirements. Some evidence furthermore indicates that specifying requirements can decrease creativity and design performance Requirements hinder creativity and design because designers become overly preoccupied with provided information. More generally, some research suggests that software requirements are an illusion created by misrepresenting design decisions as requirements in situations where no real requirements are evident.

Meanwhile, most agile software development methodologies question the need for rigorously describing software requirements upfront, which they consider a moving target. Instead, extreme programming for example describes requirements informally using user stories (short summaries fitting on an index card explaining one aspect of what the system should do), and considers it the developer&#x27;s duty to directly ask the customer for clarification. Agile methodologies attempt to capture requirements in a series of automated acceptance tests.

=== Requirements creep ===
Scope creep may occur from requirements moving over time. In Requirements management the alteration of requirements is allowed but if not adequately tracked or preceding steps (business goals then user requirements) are not throttled by additional oversight or handled as a cost and potential program failure, then requirements changes are easy and likely to happen. It is easy for requirement changes to occur faster than developers are able to produce work, and the effort to go &quot;backwards&quot; as a result.

=== Multiple requirements taxonomies ===
There are multiple taxonomies for requirements depending on which framework one is operating under. (For example, the stated standards of IEEE, vice IIBA or U.S. DoD approaches). Differing language and processes in different venues or casual speech can cause confusion and deviation from desired process.

=== Process corruptions ===
A process being run by humans is subject to human flaws in governance, where convenience or desires or politics may lead to exceptions or outright subversion of the process and deviations from the textbook way the process is supposed to proceed. Examples include:

* Process with no rigor gets no respect - If exceptions or changes are common, such as the organization running it having little independence or power or not being reliable and transparent in records, it may lead to the overall process being ignored.
* New players wanting a do-over - e.g., The natural tendency of new people to want to change their predecessor&#x27;s work to demonstrate their power or claims of value, such as a new CEO wanting to change the previous CEO&#x27;s planning, including business goals, of something (such as a software solution) already in development, or a newly created office objects to current development of a project because they did not exist when user requirements were crafted, so they begin an effort to backtrack and re-baseline the project.
* Coloring outside the lines - e.g., Users wanting more control do not just input things that meet the requirements management definition of &quot;user requirement&quot; or priority level, but insert design details or favored vendor characteristic as user requirements or everything their office says as the highest possible priority.
* Showing up late - e.g., Doing little or no effort in requirements elicitation prior to development. This may be due to thinking they will get the same benefit regardless of individual participation, or that there is no point if they can just insert demands at the testing stage and next spin, or the preference to be always right by waiting for post-work critique.

Within the U.S. Department of Defense process, some historical examples of requirements issues are
* the M-2 Bradley issues of casual requirements movement portrayed in Pentagon Wars;
* the F-16 growth from lightweight fighter concept of the Fighter mafia, attributed to F-15 program attempting to sabotage competition or individual offices putting in local desires eroding the concept of being lightweight and low cost.
* enthusiasm ca. 1998 for &#x27;Net-Ready&#x27; led to its mandate as Key Performance Parameter from the Net-Ready office, outside the office defining requirements process and not consistent to that office&#x27;s previously defined process, their definition of what a KPP was, or that some efforts might not be appropriate or able to define what constituted &#x27;Net-Ready&#x27;.

<doc id="544596" wikidata="Q643167" url="?curid=544596" title="Comfortably Numb">
<text>&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on their eleventh studio album, &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979). It was released as a single in 1980, with &quot;Hey You&quot; as the B-side. 

The music was composed by the band&#x27;s guitarist, David Gilmour; the lyrics were written by the bassist, Roger Waters, who recalled his experience of being injected with tranquilisers before a performance in 1977. Waters and Gilmour argued during the recording, with Waters seeking an orchestral arrangement and Gilmour preferring a more stripped-down arrangement. They compromised by combining both versions, and Gilmour said the song was the last time he and Waters were able to work together constructively.

&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is one of Pink Floyd&#x27;s most popular songs and is notable for its two guitar solos. In 2021, it was ranked number 179 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2005, it became the last song ever performed by Waters, Gilmour, keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason together. An early version was included on the 2012 &quot;Wall&quot; &quot;Immersion Box Set&quot;. A cover by Scissor Sisters in a radically different arrangement was a UK top ten hit in 2004. Gilmour contributed guitar to a cover by Body Count released in 2024.
==Composition==
&quot;The Wall&quot; is a concept album about an embittered and alienated rock star named Pink. In &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, Pink is medicated by a doctor so he can perform for a show. The verses are in B minor, while the chorus has been described as using a modal interchange of that key&#x27;s relative major, D major, and D Mixolydian.

==Writing==
&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; originated in a wordless demo recorded by David Gilmour while he was working on his debut solo album in 1978. He did not use the composition for that album, but kept it for future use. Gilmour originally wrote the verses in the key of E minor, which Waters changed to B minor. Gilmour also added bars for the “I have become comfortably numb&quot; line. Waters&#x27; lyrics were inspired by his experience of being injected with tranquilizers for stomach cramps before a performance in 1977 during Pink Floyd&#x27;s In the Flesh Tour. He said, &quot;That was the longest two hours of my life, trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm.&quot; The song&#x27;s working title was &quot;The Doctor&quot;. Producer Bob Ezrin looked at the completed lyrics and said they &quot;just gave me goosebumps&quot;.

== Recording ==
For the chorus, Gilmour and the session player Lee Ritenour used a pair of acoustic guitars strung in a similar manner to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced with a high E string, two octaves higher than standard tuning. The same tuning was used for the arpeggios in another song from &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;. To compose the two guitar solos, Gilmour pieced together elements from several other solos he had been working on, marking his preferred segments for the final take. He used a Big Muff distortion and delay effects on the solos.

The strings were recorded in New York by Ezrin and the American composer Michael Kamen. According to Waters, although he and Ezrin were satisfied with the recording, Gilmour found it &quot;sloppy&quot; and spent a week rerecording it. Waters described Gilmour&#x27;s version as &quot;just awful ... stilted and stiff, and it lost all the passion and life the original had&quot;. The disagreement became acrimonious. 

Eventually, the group compromised by using the orchestral elements for the main portion and using Gilmour&#x27;s stripped-down mix for the final guitar solo. Waters said: &quot;That&#x27;s all we could do without somebody &#x27;winning&#x27; and somebody &#x27;losing.&#x27; And of course, who lost, if you like, was the band, because it was clear at that point that we didn&#x27;t [all] feel the same way about music.&quot; Ezrin later said he was happy with the final mix as it provided a good contrast. Gilmour said &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; represented &quot;the last embers&quot; of his ability to work collaboratively with Waters.

==Live performances==
===Pink Floyd===
During the Wall Tour, where a giant wall was constructed across the stage during the performance, the song was performed with Waters dressed as a doctor at the bottom of the wall, and Gilmour singing and playing guitar from the top of the wall on a raised platform with spotlights shining from behind him. It was the first time the audience&#x27;s attention was drawn to the top of the completed wall. According to Gilmour, the final solo was one of the few opportunities during those concerts in which he was free to improvise completely. Gilmour said:

After Waters left the band, Gilmour revised the verses to suit his &quot;grungier&quot; preference for live performances. Verse vocals were arranged for three-part harmony. In both the &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Division Bell&quot; tours, these were sung by Richard Wright, Guy Pratt and Jon Carin.

In December 1988, a video of the live performance from the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, released on the live album &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot;, reached number 11 on MTV&#x27;s Top 20 Video Countdown. The video was two minutes shorter than the album version and the video clip had different camera angles from the home video version.

Pink Floyd performed the song at Knebworth Park on 30 June 1990 and it was published on CD as &quot;Knebworth: The Album&quot;, and on video as &quot;Live At Knebworth 1990&quot;.

A 10-minute version of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was performed at Earls Court, London on 20 October 1994, as part of The Division Bell Tour. The &quot;Pulse&quot; video release edited out approximately 1:20 minutes of the ending solo, whereas the original pay-per-view video showed the unedited version.

Pink Floyd, complete with Waters, reunited briefly to perform at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London in July 2005. The set consisted of four songs, of which &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was the last.

===Roger Waters===
After leaving Pink Floyd, Waters first performed &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; at the 1990 concert staging of &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; on 21 July 1990. The event&#x27;s purpose was to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall. Waters sang lead, Van Morrison sang Gilmour&#x27;s vocal parts backed by Rick Danko and Levon Helm of The Band, with guitar solo by Rick Di Fonzo and Snowy White, and backup by the Rundfunk Orchestra &amp; Choir. This version was used in the Academy Award-winning 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese. Van Morrison&#x27;s 2007 compilation album, &quot;Van Morrison at the Movies – Soundtrack Hits&quot; includes this version.

Waters subsequently performed the song at the Guitar Legends festival in Spain in 1991 with White on guitar solos, Waters playing acoustic guitar during the second solo, and guest vocals by Bruce Hornsby; and later at the Walden Woods benefit concert in Los Angeles in 1992 with guest vocals by Don Henley.

During Waters&#x27; In the Flesh concert series, Doyle Bramhall II and Snowy White stood in for Gilmour&#x27;s vocals and guitar solos; a role carried out by Chester Kamen and White in 2002 with Andy Fairweather Low on bass. Waters played acoustic guitar in unison with Jon Carin, with Andy Fairweather Low on bass; his part was performed by Harry Waters in 2002. In his show The Dark Side of the Moon Live, Gilmour&#x27;s vocals were performed by Jon Carin and Andy Fairweather-Low, while both playing acoustic guitar and Waters playing bass, with Dave Kilminster and White performing the guitar solos.

During Waters&#x27; The Wall Live, Robbie Wyckoff sang Gilmour&#x27;s vocals, and Dave Kilminster performed the guitar solos with G E Smith on bass, both of them standing on top of the wall as Gilmour had done in the original tour. During the performance of 12 May 2011 at the London O2 Arena, David Gilmour appeared as a guest during this song, and both sang the choruses and played guitar from the top of the wall, echoing the original performances from The Wall Tour. The song contains one of the show&#x27;s most memorable moments, when, at a specific point of the final guitar solo, Waters steps toward the wall and pounds it with his fists, triggering both an explosion of colours on the previously dark-grey screen projections and a collapsing wall.

Waters performed the song with Eddie Vedder singing Gilmour&#x27;s vocals at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief.

During Mexico City and Desert Trip shows, Waters performed with the same band setup as The Wall Live. During the Us + Them Tour, Gilmour&#x27;s vocals were performed by Jonathan Wilson with guitar solos by Kilminster and bass by Gus Seyffert. On This Is Not a Drill, Waters performed a new version of the song as an introduction to the concerts.

===David Gilmour===
Gilmour has performed the song during each of his solo tours. In About Face, his 1984 tour to promote his album of the same name, the set list referred to the song as &quot;Come on Big Bum&quot;. The vocals during the verses were performed by band members Gregg Dechert and Mickey Feat (in harmony).

In 2001 and 2002, the verse vocals were performed on different dates by guest singers Robert Wyatt, Kate Bush, Durga McBroom, and Bob Geldof, who had played Pink in the film version of &quot;The Wall&quot;. Geldof, who had not memorised the verses, read the lyrics as he sang.

On 29 May 2006, at the Royal Albert Hall, David Bowie made a guest appearance and sang the verses, in his final live performance in the United Kingdom. The next day, 30 May, Richard Wright sang the verses by himself (as on the rest of the tour) at the same venue. Both performances were included on Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;Remember That Night&quot; concert video, compiled from all three of his shows there on 29, 30 and 31 May 2006, which were part of his On an Island concert series to promote his album of the same name.

In 2006, Gilmour performed the song in a concert, with the Polish Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra providing the orchestral parts that had usually been created with backing tapes or multiple synthesizers. This version was released on &quot;Live in Gdańsk.&quot;

On the 2016 Rattle That Lock Tour, the verses were sung by Jon Carin (on legs 1–3), Chuck Leavell (on leg 4) (this version can be seen and heard on &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;), and Bryan Chambers (leg 5). They were also performed by Benedict Cumberbatch on 28 September 2016 at the Royal Albert Hall.

During a performance at the Royal Albert Hall on 24 April 2016, Gilmour and his band incorporated the final refrain of the Prince song &quot;Purple Rain&quot; into the song as a tribute to Prince, who had died three days earlier.

==Reception==
In both its original studio release and all subsequent live versions, Comfortably Numb has since received unanimous acclaim from music critics and many high-profile musicians following the release of its parent album, The Wall, at the end of November 1979, and has gone on to become universally recognized as one of the greatest songs of all time and as one of Pink Floyd’s definitive works, as a band. 

David Gilmour’s performance on the track has been consistently lauded as being the crowning achievement of his career as a guitarist. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Gilmour&#x27;s guitar cries out eloquently.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;it displays the supergroup&#x27;s lyrical strengths and passion for colorful, textured melody&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;dreamy vocals float over a sea of thick synthesizer textures and solo guitar waves&quot;. Author Mike Cormack wrote that the song &quot;is perhaps the apex of rock music as an artform. No other song cuts deeper, says so much about the human condition, or hits such moments of beauty and horror&quot; and that Gilmour&#x27;s second guitar solo &quot;is an utter master at work, leaving space, repeating and building on licks to give a sense of structure, not overplaying, building to a shrieking climax, and then fading out while leaving the listener wanting more&quot;. Alaa Abd El-Fattah said &quot;there was a moment of almost &quot;Sufi&quot;, exultation, when he heard &#x27;Comfortably Numb&#x27;...that amazing, great solo ringing in my ears while the blood came back to my limbs.&quot;

In 2011, the song was ranked fifth in the BBC Radio 4&#x27;s listeners&#x27; Desert Island Discs choices. Gilmour&#x27;s solo was rated the fourth best guitar solo of all time by &quot;Guitar World&quot;, in a reader poll. In August 2006, it was voted the greatest guitar solo of all time in a poll by listeners of the radio station Planet Rock. Gilmour&#x27;s guitar tone in the song was named best guitar sound by &quot;Guitarist&quot; in November 2010. The two guitar solos were ranked as the greatest guitar solos of all time by Planet Rock listeners. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; both ranked the song number four on their lists of the greatest Pink Floyd songs.

=== Scissor Sisters version ===
American pop rock band Scissor Sisters recorded a radically re-arranged disco-oriented version released in January 2004 on Polydor, with the B-side &quot;Rock My Spot (Crevice Canyon)&quot;. This release reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. David Gilmour and Nick Mason expressed a liking for the group&#x27;s version, and Roger Waters is said to have congratulated the Scissor Sisters on the version, although a lyric was changed, from &quot;a distant ship&#x27;s smoke on the horizon&quot; to &quot;a distant ship floats on the horizon&quot;. Jake Shears, the band&#x27;s lead singer, was invited by Gilmour to sing &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; with him in some 2006 shows, but the idea was dropped at the last moment to Shears&#x27; public disappointment. This cover received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording but lost to &quot;Toxic&quot; by Britney Spears.

====Release history====
=== &quot;Comfortably Numb 2022&quot; ===

In November 2022, Waters released a new version, &quot;Comfortably Numb 2022&quot;, recorded during the COVID-19 lockdowns to use as an opener for his This Is Not a Drill concerts. The song was later included on his album &quot;The Lockdown Sessions&quot;. A music video was produced and directed by Sean Evans.

The new version was recorded at various studios during the tour&#x27;s North American leg, including Bias Studios outside of Washington D.C., Electric Lady Studios in New York City, Armoury Studios in Vancouver, and Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta. It was produced by Waters and Gus Seyffert. 

Waters lowered the key to A minor &quot;to make it darker&quot;, and removed the solos but for a vocal solo from Shanay Johnson. He said he intended it as &quot;a wakeup call, and a bridge towards a kinder future with more talking to strangers&quot;.
=== Body Count version ===
The American metal band Body Count released a cover of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; in September 2024. It features Gilmour on guitar and additional lyrics by the rapper Ice-T. Gilmour offered to record guitar after Ice-T contacted him to request permission to cover the song. Ice-T said it was an &quot;introspective song&quot; that acknowledged his advancing age: &quot;I&#x27;m telling the younger generation, you&#x27;ve got two choices: you can keep the fire burning or you can give up.&quot; Gilmour said he liked the additional lyrics, and that &quot;It astonishes me that a tune I wrote almost 50 years ago is back with this great new approach. They&#x27;ve made it relevant again.&quot;

<text>An umbrella organization is an association of (often related, industry-specific) institutions who work together formally to coordinate activities and/or pool resources. In business, political, and other environments, it provides resources and identities to the smaller organizations. In this kind of arrangement, it is sometimes responsible, to some degree, for the groups under its care. Umbrella organizations are prominent in cooperatives and in civil society, and can engage in advocacy or collective bargaining on behalf of their members.

<text>Ferdinand Schörner (12 June 1892 – 2 July 1973) was a German military commander who held the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of Nazi Germany during World War II. He commanded several army groups and was the last Commander-in-chief of the German Army.

Schörner was a dedicated Nazi and became well known for his ruthlessness. By the end of World War II, he was Hitler&#x27;s favourite commander. Following the war he was convicted of war crimes by courts in the Soviet Union and West Germany, and was imprisoned in the Soviet Union, East Germany and West Germany. 

==Early life==

Schörner was born on 12 June 1892 in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire. He entered the Bavarian Army in October 1911 as a one-year volunteer with the Bavarian Leib Regiment, and by November 1914 he was a &quot;Leutnant der Reserve&quot;. Serving in World War I, he was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; military order as a lieutenant when he took part in the Battle of Caporetto, which shattered the Italian lines in autumn 1917. Continuing in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, between the two wars, Schörner served as a staff officer and instructor. In 1923 he was adjutant to General Otto von Lossow, the commander of &quot;Wehrkreis VII&quot; (military district) in Munich and participated in the defeat of the Beer Hall Putsch.

==World War II==
Schörner commanded the 98th Mountain Regiment in the invasion of Poland in 1939. During the 1941 Balkans campaign, he commanded the German 6th Mountain Division and earned the Knight&#x27;s Cross for his role in breaching the Metaxas Line. With this division, Schörner took part in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. The 6th &quot;Gebirgs&quot; Division was assigned to the Arctic sectors in the Eastern Front. In 1942 as a &quot;General der Gebirgstruppe&quot; he took command of the XIX Mountain Corps, part of the German Army in Finland. With this command he participated in the failed attack on Murmansk and the stalemate war that followed. Schörner&#x27;s task was to keep the Pechenga Nickel Works in German hands. When the Soviets opened an offensive against the Arctic sector, the division took part in the fighting. In February 1942, Schörner was promoted to the rank of &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;, commanding the Mountain Corps Norway.
He later commanded the XXXX Panzer Corps on the Eastern Front from November 1943 to January 1944. In March 1944 he was made commander of Army Group A, and in May commander of Army Group South Ukraine. After stating that the Crimean port of Sevastopol could be held for a long time even if Crimea fell, he changed his mind and against Hitler&#x27;s wishes, evacuated the Black Sea port. This retreat occurred too late and the German–Romanian 17th Army that was holding Crimea suffered severe losses, with many men killed or captured while waiting on the piers to be evacuated. During the late spring of 1944, Schörner oversaw the retreat from the Dniester River in Romania.

Schörner was promoted to the rank of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; in May 1944. In July he became commander of Army Group North, which was later renamed Army Group Courland, where he stayed until January 1945 when he was made commander of Army Group Centre, defending Czechoslovakia and the upper reaches of the River Oder. He became a favorite of high-level Nazi leaders such as Joseph Goebbels, whose diary entries from March and April 1945 have many words of praise for Schörner and his methods. On 5 April 1945, Schörner was promoted to field marshal and was named as the new commander-in-chief of the German Army High Command (&quot;OKH&quot;, &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot;) in Hitler&#x27;s last testament. He nominally served in this post until the surrender of the Third Reich on 8 May 1945 but continued to command his army group, since no staff was available to him. He did not have any discernible influence in the final days of the Reich.

On 7 May, the day General Alfred Jodl, Chief-of-Staff of the &quot;OKW&quot; was negotiating the surrender of all German forces at SHAEF, the last the &quot;OKW&quot; had heard from Schörner was on 2 May. He had reported he intended to fight his way west and surrender his army group to the Americans. On 8 May, &quot;OKW&quot; colonel Wilhelm Meyer-Detring was escorted through the American lines to contact Schörner. The colonel reported that Schörner had ordered his operational command to observe the surrender but he could not guarantee that he would be obeyed everywhere. Schörner ordered a continuation of fighting against Red Army and the Czech insurgents of the Prague uprising. Later that day, Schörner deserted and flew to Austria, where he was arrested by the Americans on 18 May. Elements of Army Group Centre continued to resist the overwhelming force of the Red Army invading Czechoslovakia during the final Prague Offensive. Units of Army Group Centre, the last big German units to surrender, capitulated on 11 May 1945.

==Post-war trials and convictions==
With the war over, Schörner handed himself in to the Americans on 18 May 1945, who a few weeks later passed him over to the Soviet authorities as a prisoner of war. In August 1951 he was charged with war crimes, and in February 1952 the Military Board of the Soviet Supreme Court sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment. A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in April 1952 reduced this sentence to 12 and a half years. A decree of December 1954 allowed him to be handed over to authorities of East Germany, and he was released in 1955. Returning to West Germany, he was arrested and charged with executions of German Army soldiers accused of desertion. Schörner was found guilty of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter and sentenced to four and a half years in prison. He was released on 4 August 1960 and lived in obscurity in Munich until his death in 1973. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving field marshal of the Third Reich. In the late 1960s, he gave a lengthy interview to Italian historian Mario Silvestri on his role and actions during the Austro-German victory at the Battle of Caporetto in World War I, but rarely spoke about his World War II service.

==Assessment==
German veterans particularly criticized Schörner for a 1945 order that all soldiers found behind the front lines, who did not possess written orders to be there, were to be court-martialled on the spot and hanged if found guilty of desertion. This is mentioned in the writings of Siegfried Knappe, Hans von Luck and Joseph Goebbels. &quot;Deserters get no mercy from him&quot; Goebbels wrote of Schörner on 11 March 1945. &quot;They are hanged from the nearest tree with a placard round their necks saying &#x27;I am a deserter. I have declined to defend German women and children and therefore I have been hanged&#x27;&quot;. (&quot;Ich bin ein Deserteur. Ich habe mich geweigert, deutsche Frauen und Kinder zu beschützen und bin deshalb aufgehängt worden.&quot;) Goebbels continued with, &quot;Naturally such methods are effective. Every man in Schörner&#x27;s area knows that he may die at the front but will inevitably die in the rear&quot;. Gottlob Herbert Bidermann, a German infantry officer, of the 132nd Infantry Division, who served in Schörner&#x27;s command in 1944–45, reported in his memoirs that the General was despised by officers and men alike.

Schörner was said to be devoted to Hitler, a view that is seen as confirmed by Hitler&#x27;s appointment of Schörner as his replacement as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on his suicide in the Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler. Schörner did not hesitate to second Hitler&#x27;s fantasy in the last weeks of the war, agreeing that the Red Army&#x27;s main objective would be Prague instead of Berlin (in itself a colossal strategic blunder) and so leading him to weaken the critically thin defense lines in front of Berlin. Historian Ian Kershaw described him in 2011 (&quot;BBC History Magazine&quot;) as &quot;extraordinarily brutal&quot;. In &quot;The End&quot; (2012) Kershaw describes Schörner as &quot;a fanatical (Nazi) loyalist&quot;, an indication of this being that he had served for a brief spell in March 1944 as Chief of the NS Leadership Staff of the Army. The latter was responsible for coordinating relations between the military and the Nazi Party.
Schörner is commonly represented in historical literature as a simple disciplinarian and a slavish devotee of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s defensive orders, after Germany lost the initiative in the second half of World War II in 1942/43. More recent research by American historian Howard Davis Grier and German historian Karl-Heinz Frieser depicts Schörner as a talented commander with &quot;astonishing&quot; organizational ability in managing an army group of 500,000 men during the fighting in late 1944 on the Eastern Front. He was harsh against superiors as well as subordinates and carried out operations on his own authority against Hitler&#x27;s orders when he considered it necessary, such as the evacuation of the Sõrve Peninsula.

<doc id="544605" wikidata="Q473004" url="?curid=544605" title="Empty Glass">
<text>Empty Glass is the third solo studio album by English rock musician Pete Townshend, and his first composed of original material, released on 21 April 1980 by Atco Records.

The album deals with issues that Townshend was struggling with at the time, including alcoholism, drug abuse, marital problems and deceased friends, particularly Keith Moon, the Who&#x27;s former drummer, who died in 1978. &quot;Empty Glass&quot; also contained the devotional love song, &quot;Let My Love Open the Door&quot;, which became a Top 10 hit (#9) in the US, and the modestly successful singles &quot;Rough Boys&quot; (#89) and &quot;A Little Is Enough&quot; (#72).

The album was rated No. 57 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 100 greatest of the 1980s. A Gibson poll rated it at No. 5 among &quot;the greatest albums released by an artist who was previously in a successful band&quot;.

==History==
In an interview with Murray Lerner on the film &quot;The Who: Live at the Isle of Wight&quot;, Townshend explained the album&#x27;s title:
This concept was derived from the work of the Persian lyric poet Hafez, which Townshend became interested in from his involvement with Meher Baba, an Indian spiritual master who claimed he was an avatar – God in human form.

The album was written and recorded between 1978 and 1980, when activity with the Who had started to pick up again, and Townshend found himself having to write for both his solo project and his band. As a result, &quot;Empty Glass&quot; was considered superior to the Who&#x27;s subsequent studio album &quot;Face Dances&quot; (1981), with critics calling it a Who album that never was.

The Who&#x27;s lead vocalist Roger Daltrey later commented that he felt let down by Townshend, and that many of the songs from the album would have worked well for the Who, among them &quot;Rough Boys&quot; and &quot;Empty Glass&quot;. Townshend countered by saying that &quot;Rough Boys&quot; was the one song Daltrey would have wanted clarified (in terms of the song&#x27;s homoerotic subtext) and toned down were he to sing it, thus defeating its message, while &quot;Empty Glass&quot; had been recorded during sessions for &quot;Who Are You&quot; in 1978; a version featuring Keith Moon on drums and John Entwistle on bass appeared on the 1996 reissue of that album. This version is notable for suicidal undertones in the lyrics that were changed for &quot;Empty Glass&quot;: the line &quot;Killing each other, then we jump off the ledge&quot; became &quot;Killing each other by driving a wedge&quot;.

The album was produced by Chris Thomas, whose credits included Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and the Pretenders&#x27; debut studio album. &quot;For a long time,&quot; Townshend said, &quot;I wanted to work with Todd Rundgren, and I asked him to produce my solo album which he agreed to do. And then I suddenly realised it probably wasn&#x27;t a good idea because we&#x27;re so alike in a lot of ways. I would like to work with him. I think he&#x27;s a better guitar player than me and a better singer but I think what really worried me about the prospect of him producing my solo album was that I&#x27;m influenced by him enough as it is. Do you understand? And I like the way I&#x27;m influenced by him at the moment.&quot;

==Writing and recording==
Townshend began writing the songs and recording demos for &quot;Empty Glass&quot; in his 24-track home studio around late 1978, but recording sessions for the album would only begin in November 1979 at Wessex Studios in North London, with producer Chris Thomas at the helm, and Bill Price as the engineer. Additional recording was done at AIR Studios in Oxford Circus and Townshend&#x27;s Eel Pie Studios from then until March 1980. Townshend performed all the guitar and synthesizer parts on the album, and brought in various musicians to lay down additional instrumentation. The album&#x27;s line-up included Who touring keyboardist John Bundrick on piano and organ, Tony Butler on bass, Simon Phillips, Kenney Jones, Mark Brzezicki, and James Asher on drums, Peter Hope-Evans on harmonica, and Raphael Rudd, who arranged the horn parts on &quot;Rough Boys&quot;.

==Cover artwork==
The sleeve was designed by British-Irish photographer Bob Carlos Clarke. The album&#x27;s title is an allusion to a poem by the Sufi lyric poet Hafez, and at one point the album had the working title of &quot;Sacred Animal&quot;.

The sleeve of the vinyl album (SD 32–100) includes this dedication:
:This album is dedicated to my wife Karen.&quot;Rough Boys&quot; is dedicated to my children Emma and Minta and to the Sex Pistols.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Empty Glass&quot; as &quot;impressive album that showcases perhaps above all, Townshend&#x27;s incredible versatility on guitar with each riveting riff rising to the forefront.&quot; The reviewer conclude that &quot;the production, along with Townshend&#x27;s impeccable timing, delivery and rhythmic sense gives the album an urgent and contemporary flavor, and an indication of what rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll should be.&quot;

In a review of a remastered release for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, John Bergstrom said that it had &quot;dated poorly&quot; in terms of arrangement and production but &quot;ultimately, Townshend&#x27;s songwriting makes the best of &quot;Empty Glass&quot; more than worthwhile.&quot;

<doc id="544611" wikidata="Q914694" url="?curid=544611" title="League Against Cruel Sports">
<text>The League Against Cruel Sports, formerly known as the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports, is a UK-based animal welfare charity which campaigns to stop blood sports such as fox hunting, hare and deer hunting; game bird shooting; and animal fighting. The charity helped bring about the Hunting Act 2004 and Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, which banned hunting with hounds in England, Wales and Scotland.

==History==

===Early years===

The League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports was founded in 1925 by Ernest Bell and Henry B. Amos with George Greenwood as first president. Their inaugural public meeting was held on 25 November 1925 at Church House, Westminster and was chaired by Greenwood, a council member of the RSPCA. The League opposed the suffering of any sentient animal, either directly or indirectly for the purpose of sport.

The League was founded due to frustration over the RSPCA&#x27;s lack of &quot;emphasis on the abolition of hunting or on Royalty to stop hunting&quot;. In 1927, the League&#x27;s Advisory Committee included Henry S. Salt, Percy Scholes, several clergymen Frederic Donaldson, Robert Forman Horton, Walter Walsh and others. In 1929, Captain Edmund T. MacMichael commented that although the League condemns all forms of hunting they were primarily concerned with abolition of stag hunting and demanding the substitution of a drag in place of any living animal. The League&#x27;s official journal &quot;Cruel Sports&quot; was published monthly. Hugh Walpole wrote an article in &quot;Cruel Sports&quot; describing his negative experience of fox hunting, &quot;I have never in all my experience of war seen anything so terrified as that fox. I realised that morning I had seen a perfectly bestial thing... I don&#x27;t believe the fox or the otter enjoys being hunted; I believe they experience fear, dismay, and pain&quot;. 

In 1931, Ernest Bell and Stephen Coleridge resigned in protest over Henry Amos&#x27;s continuous criticism of the RSPCA. Lady Cory who was also a member of the RSPCA resigned her presidency in 1932 as the League&#x27;s journal had criticized other animal welfare societies and individuals. In 1932, a split-off organization, the National Society for the Abolition of Cruel Sports was formed by Ernest Bell and Stephen Coleridge following an internal dispute within the League over their relationship with the RSPCA.

The League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports was renamed the League Against Cruel Sports in 1938.

===Activism===
In 1954, Joseph Sharp, secretary of the league advocated humane destruction of foxes by cyanide fumigation. In 1957, chairman Edward Hemingway proposed a Bill to be designed to give deer on Exmoor and Quantock Hills statutory protection which would bring an end to the &quot;distressing
scenes of the hunt&quot;. 

It was reported in 1959 that members of the League were creating false chemical trails on Exmoor to confuse hounds when hunts take place. Edward Hemingway was using a &quot;secret system&quot; which was sent to him by a Scottish estate worker to confuse stag hunters from finding deer where they were expected. In 1959, Lord Grey De Ruthyn signed a letter of protest to Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh accusing Prince Philip of teaching Prince Charles to like blood sports.

In 1961, four League members who were opponents of fox hunting were expelled from the RSPCA. The RSPCA council unanimously decided that their conduct had been &quot;prejudicial to the interests of the society&quot;. One of the members that had been excluded gained support from 274 RSPCA members that there should be a poll on fox hunting. Edward Hemingway stated that RSPCA&#x27;s expulsion of the four members was &quot;an insult to the whole animal welfare movement&quot;.

In 1962, the League sent members of the RSPCA 20,828 ballot papers on the issue of fox hunting. Nearly 8000 papers were returned. The result was 1291 for fox hunting and 6343 against. Edward Hemingway commented that the ballot was held at the request of the RSPCA members. The RSPCA responded by warning its members to ignore the ballot and stated that the ballot was not valid as it had not been authorized. The League&#x27;s executive committee concluded &quot;an inescapable conclusion which must be drawn from the result is that the RSPCA, as at present constituted, is not any longer a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals&quot;.

The League supported the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act, passed in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament, and the Hunting Act 2004. The League has campaigned against commercial breeding of non-native game birds for shooting, and against hunts that it believes are continuing to hunt wild mammals contrary to the 2004 ban.

It also campaigns to extend hunting legislation from Scotland, England and Wales to Northern Ireland. Between 2006 and 2008, it successfully undertook private prosecutions against four hunt officials under the Hunting Act, because the police would not take action, and argued that this showed that the Hunting Act was clear in its meaning. The first prosecution led to a conviction, but this was overturned on appeal, and the second conviction was upheld in the Crown Court.

The League considers commercial greyhound racing to be cruel and inhumane. In 2014, the League published a report with GREY2K USA Worldwide on the state of greyhound
racing in Great Britain.

In 2024, the League expressed concerns about fox hunters exploiting a loophole in The Hunting with Dogs (Scotland) Act 2023. The law introduced a licensing scheme which allows the use of more than two dogs in limited circumstances. The league noted that at least 41 licences were issued in the first hunting season since the act was introduced.

===Presidents===

Early presidents included Lady Cory, Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, Stephen Coleridge and Hamilton Fyfe. In 1947, Edith Sitwell was president of the League. Lord Grey de Ruthyn was president in the 1950s up until his death in 1963. In 1958, he announced his intention of speaking in the House of Lords to further the League&#x27;s campaign against hunting. The Earl of Listowel was president from 1963 to 1967.

Donald Soper was president of the League from 1967 to 1997. Annette Crosbie was president from 2003 to 2006.

===Wildlife reserves===

In 1958, Ernest Hemingway and Joseph Sharp purchased the freehold for Slowley Woods, near Luxborough which was the first League Against Cruel Sports sanctuary &quot;for wild animals, particular those that are hunted&quot;. In 1988, it was reported that the League purchased 36 properties at a cost of 2.5 million to establish 2500 acres of wildlife. The League owns several wildlife reserves in and around Exmoor and Quantock Hills to prevent cruel sports from taking place.

==Controversies==

James Barrington a former Executive Director of the League Against Cruel Sports who later became a consultant to the Countryside Alliance has alleged that mismanagement by the League on Baronsdown reserve has caused large outbreaks of Bovine tuberculosis in deer. He has criticized the League for its lack of wildlife management. The League has denied the allegation. John Bryant a former Press Officer and Wildlife Research Officer commented that James Barrington met with leading members of the hunting fraternity without the knowledge of the League&#x27;s Executive Committee. After Barrington resigned from the League over a claim of constructive dismissal, he accepted a settlement of £20,000 and became pro-hunting.

In 2019, it was reported that saboteurs have refused to co-operate with the League after accusing them of using information they gained to promote themselves. Martin Sims, the League&#x27;s Director of Investigations has been criticized by saboteurs for attending hunt fundraising events including a point to point race organized by the Cornwall Hunt Club. In response, a spokesperson for the League commented that Sims attended the races because his daughter is pursuing a career as a jockey and given the dangers he wanted to attend.

===Political allegations===

In 1983, Richard Course a former Executive Director of the League was quoted in &quot;The Times&quot; as pledging to give the Labour Party £100,000 for the general election. After Labour lost the election it is alleged that Richard Course had never intended to give the party the money. Course denied such allegations and stated they were being promoted by the British Field Sports Society to spread disinformation and the League has never given money to a political party. In 1986, Charles Nodder, Information Officer for the British Field Sports Society stated that Course had &quot;misrepresented the facts&quot; as in the annual report of the League for 1979 there is a statement which says &quot;The League made a donation of £80,000 to the Labour party&quot;.

In May, 1983 a High Court Judge ruled that the Labour Party must repay 50,000 of the election gift from the League. The other £30,000 given by the League to publicize Labour&#x27;s animal welfare policies need not be returned. Eric Heffer a vice-president of the League stated the situation was &quot;regrettable&quot; but the Labour party would obey the court&#x27;s decision to repay £50,000 to the league. 

In 1988, Richard Course resigned over a dispute with the committee. He alleged that donations from the League had been made to fund Labour candidates without knowledge of its members and that accounts had been faked to conceal transactions. He demanded a department of trade investigation into the League. The allegations were denied by Donald Soper.

In 2010, the League was censured by the Charity Commission for describing the Conservatives as the &quot;nasty party&quot;. The commission said the League&#x27;s claim, published in a press release had contravened charity rules on party political neutrality. In a regulatory case report the Commission stated that the &quot;wording chosen by the charity was party political in character and went beyond the sort of statement that a charity can properly make&quot;. The League agreed to withdraw its press release.

In July 2024, it was reported that the police were investigating fraud allegations against the League. Andy Knott, the League&#x27;s former chief executive alleged that their fundraising appeals in the run-up to the 2024 United Kingdom general election were misleading. It was also reported that Knott is taking the League and Labour MP Dan Norris, the former chair to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal. Knott has alleged that the Labour Party was &quot;interfering in the strategy and operations of the charity&quot;. In September 2024, Surrey Police dropped its investigation into fraud allegations made against the League due to lack of evidence. A spokesperson for the League commented, &quot;there was clearly no merit to the claims made against us&quot;.

===Malpractice allegations===

In 2015, it was claimed that whistleblowers’ concerns about alleged malpractice within the League were not investigated properly. Allegations made of bullying and sexist culture at the top of the organization were strongly denied by the League. John Cooper a barrister who had been president of the league since 2011 was removed from his position. Cooper commented that &quot;my summary removal as president, without any prior warning, discussion or communication, is a direct result of my taking the decision to support vulnerable staff against management and trustees&quot;.

In 2018, Chris Williamson was suspended from the League and expelled from their board after he raised concerns about the actions of their senior management team. Williamson alleged that they asked a computer expert to hack the email account of Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance. Seven trustees also resigned. The Charity Commission responded that they were investigating the allegations. The League denied all allegations and commented that they were &quot;motivated purely by ex-trustees with a grudge&quot;. The League also stated that Williamson was expelled &quot;after he supported someone who was abusing members of staff&quot;.

In 2018, Jordi Casamitjana alleged he was sacked by the League after disclosing it invested pension funds in firms involved in animal testing and that he was discriminated against because of his ethical vegan belief. The League stated that he was dismissed because of gross misconduct. Casamitjana took legal action against the League which ended in an out-of-court settlement in his favour. In 2020, the League commented, &quot;Having revisited the issue we now accept that Mr Casamitjana did nothing wrong with such communications, which were motivated by his belief in ethical veganism. We are grateful to Mr Casamitjana for having raised the issue of pensions to us, which allowed us to change our default pension fund to an ethical one closer to our values.&quot;

Peter Egan and Penny Morgan, both vice-presidents of the League were sacked in 2018. It is alleged that Egan was removed for asking questions about the failures of the League which led to the Charity Commission using its statutory powers against it. Egan alleged he was forced out as he &quot;wanted an open and transparent discussion&quot;. Morgan said she had been removed &quot;for daring to ask some questions about what&#x27;s going on in a wonderful animal charity that seems to be suffering upheavals&quot;.

==Timeline==
* 1924 – The League was founded by Henry B. Amos to oppose rabbit coursing – he was successful in achieving a ban. This resulted in the organisation expanding its remit to include other blood sports – such as fox, hare and deer hunting.
* 1975 – A bill seeking to ban hare coursing, supported by the League, was passed through the House of Commons, but did not receive approval in the House of Lords.
* 1978 – The League secured legal protection for otters, including a ban on hunting them. The aquatic mammal was up until that point hunted with packs of hounds, one of the reasons for their numbers declining.
* 1992 – The League helped secure the Protection of Badgers Act, which expanded the protection of the mammals themselves to their setts. The homes of badgers are illegally targeted for several reasons, including being blocked by fox hunts to stop animals being pursued by hounds fleeing underground.
* 2002 – Fox, hare and deer hunting and hare coursing was banned in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, which was introduced by MSPs following campaigning by the League and other animal protection organisations.
* 2004 – Fox, hare and deer hunting and hare coursing was banned in England and Wales under the Hunting Act 2004. The legislation was introduced by MPs following campaigning by the League and other animal protection organisations.
* 2005 – The Hunting Act 2004 came into force – making fox, hare and deer hunting and coursing illegal across England and Wales.
* 2005 – The Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition held its final meeting at Great Altcar in Lancashire, closing after 169 years following passage of the Hunting Act.
* 2006 – A huntsman with the Exmoor Foxhounds was found guilty of illegally hunting foxes with dogs in a private prosecution brought by LACS, but the case was overturned on appeal.
* 2007 – Two members of the Quantock Staghounds were successfully prosecuted by the League following chasing a deer across Exmoor.
* 2008 – Two members of the Minehead Harriers pleaded guilty to chasing a fox with a pack of hounds in a private prosecution by LACS.
* 2009 – The League announced a new campaign against dog fighting, amidst news reports that there is an increase in dog fighting in London.
* 2014 - The League celebrates 90 years of campaigning against cruelty to animals in the name of sport. Figures from the Ministry of Justice show that there have been 341 convictions under the Hunting Act 2004.
* 2015 – Prime Minister David Cameron offered a free-vote on repealing the Hunting Act, backing down shortly afterwards following pressure form the League, MPs and other animal protection organisations. 
* 2015 – Cross-channel ferry companies stop shipping pheasants and partridges from French factory-farms to British shooting estates, following an investigation and lobbying by the League.
* 2018 – Conservative Party drops its manifesto commitment to offer a free-vote on repealing the Hunting Act following pressure from the League, meaning no Westminster party any longer supports repealing the hunting ban. 
* 2018 – Scottish Government announces intention to strengthen the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, which bans hunting with hounds in Scotland, following pressure from the League and other animal protection organisations. 
* 2018 – Welsh Government bans pheasant and partridge shooting on public land following campaigning and pressure from the League and Animal Aid.
* 2018 – The Labour Party backs calls made by the League to strengthen the Hunting Act – including prison sentences for those who chase and kill wild mammals.
* 2019 – University of Wales suspends pheasant shooting on its countryside campus at Gregynog Hall following campaigning by the League.
*2024 – The League welcomed the Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto commitment to ban trail hunting.

<text>José Maria de Eça de Queiroz or Queirós (; 25 November 1845 – 16 August 1900) is generally considered to have been the greatest Portuguese writer in the realist style. Zola considered him to be far greater than Flaubert. In the London &quot;Observer&quot;, Jonathan Keates ranked him alongside Dickens, Balzac and Tolstoy.

==Biography==
Eça de Queiroz was born in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal, in 1845. An illegitimate child, he was officially recorded as the son of José Maria de Almeida Teixeira de Queiroz and Carolina Augusta Pereira d&#x27;Eça. His unmarried mother left home so that her son could be born away from social scandal. Although his parents married when he was four years old, he lived with his paternal grandparents until he was ten.

At age 16, he went to Coimbra to study law at the University of Coimbra; there he met the poet Antero de Quental. Eça&#x27;s first work was a series of prose poems, published in the &quot;Gazeta de Portugal&quot; magazine, which eventually appeared in book form in a posthumous collection edited by Batalha Reis entitled &quot;Prosas Bárbaras&quot; (&quot;Barbarous texts&quot;). He worked as a journalist at Évora, then returned to Lisbon and, with his former school friend Ramalho Ortigão and others, created the &quot;Correspondence&quot; of the fictional adventurer Fradique Mendes. This amusing work was first published in 1900.
In 1869 and 1870, Eça de Queiroz travelled to Egypt and watched the opening of the Suez Canal, which inspired several of his works, most notably &quot;O Mistério da Estrada de Sintra&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of the Sintra Road&quot;, 1870), written in collaboration with Ramalho Ortigão, in which Fradique Mendes appears. &quot;A Relíquia&quot; (&quot;The Relic&quot;) was also written at this period but was published only in 1887. The work was strongly influenced by &quot;Memorie di Giuda&quot; (&quot;Memoirs of Judas&quot;) by Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, such as to lead some scholars to accuse the Portuguese writer of plagiarism.

When he was later dispatched to Leiria to work as a municipal administrator, Eça de Queiroz wrote his first realist novel, &quot;O Crime do Padre Amaro&quot; (&quot;The Crime of Father Amaro&quot;), which is set in the city and first appeared in 1875.

Eça then worked in the Portuguese consular service and after two years&#x27; service at Havana was stationed, from late 1874 until April 1879, at 53 Grey Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, where there is a memorial plaque in his honour. His diplomatic duties included the dispatch of detailed reports to the Portuguese foreign office concerning the unrest in the Northumberland and Durham coalfields – in which, as he points out, the miners earned twice as much as those in South Wales, along with free housing and a weekly supply of coal. The Newcastle years were among the most productive of his literary career. He published the second version of &quot;O Crime de Padre Amaro&quot; in 1876 and another celebrated novel, &quot;O Primo Basílio&quot; (&quot;Cousin Bazilio&quot;) in 1878, as well as working on a number of other projects. These included the first of his &quot;Cartas de Londres&quot; (&quot;Letters from London&quot;) which were printed in the Lisbon daily newspaper &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; and afterwards appeared in book form as &quot;Cartas de Inglaterra&quot;. 

As early as 1878 he had at least given a name to his masterpiece &quot;Os Maias&quot; (&quot;The Maias&quot;), though this was largely written while he was Portuguese consul in Bristol from 1879 to 1888. It was published the year he left Bristol to become the Portuguese consul-general in Paris. In February 1886, he married Maria Emília de Castro in Lisbon. She joined him at his residence in 38 Stoke Hill, Stoke Bishop, where there is also a memorial plaque. However, Maria Emília was not happy there; so they decided to rent a house in Notting Hill, London. As his earlier letters indicate that he had already made frequent visits to London, this was probably a satisfactory arrangement for both. Thereafter Eça commuted between London and Bristol, where his house in Stoke Bishop was equidistant between the outer docks at Avonmouth and inner docks in Bristol.

Eça, a cosmopolitan widely read in English literature, was not enamoured of English society, but he was fascinated by its oddity. In Bristol he wrote: &quot;Everything about this society is disagreeable to me – from its limited way of thinking to its indecent manner of cooking vegetables.&quot; As often happens when a writer is unhappy, the weather is endlessly bad. Nevertheless, he was rarely bored and was content to stay in England for some fifteen years. &quot;I detest England, but this does not stop me from declaring that as a thinking nation, she is probably the foremost.&quot; It may be said that England acted as a constant stimulus and a corrective to Eça&#x27;s traditionally Portuguese Francophilia.

Eça&#x27;s politics were liberal, although he was also influenced by the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. In 1898, upon growing more pessimistic about the future of Portugal and Europe, he described himself as a &quot;vague, saddened anarchist&quot;.

He had actively sought the position of Portuguese consul-general in Paris and, having obtained it in 1888, remained in post for the rest of his life. He lived at Neuilly-sur-Seine and continued to write journalism (&quot;Ecos de Paris&quot;, &quot;Echoes from Paris&quot;) as well as literary criticism. He died in 1900 of either tuberculosis or, according to numerous contemporary physicians, Crohn&#x27;s disease. His son António Eça de Queiroz would hold government office under António de Oliveira Salazar. He was first buried in a family vault in Alto de São João Cemetery and later exhumed and moved to a grave in Santa Cruz do Douro Cemetery, in Baião Municipality, Portugal. His remains were transferred to the Church of Santa Engrácia (the National Pantheon) in January 2025.

==Adaptations==
You can check out the several Cinema and TV adaptations of Eça&#x27;s works at the https://www.imdb.com/find/?q=o%20primo%20bas%C3%ADlio%20&amp;ref_=nv_sr_sm

The first adaptation of an Eça de Queirós Novel is probably &quot;O Primo Basílio&quot;, wich was adapted five times https://www.imdb.com/find/?q=o%20primo%20bas%C3%ADlio%20&amp;ref_=nv_sr_sm for Cinema and Television

&quot;Os Maias&quot; was adapted three Times. The First in 1979 by RTP Rádio e Televisão de Portugal as a 3 episode TV Series. The second in 2001 by Rede Globo as a series, available through Globo&#x27;s Streaming Service Globoplay. And the third, again by RTP Rádio e Televisão de Portugal in 2015 as a 4 episode TV Series (that has also a condensed theatrical movie version). This series is available on RTPs streaming service RTP Play.
There have been two film versions of &quot;O Crime do Padre Amaro&quot;, a Mexican one in 2002 and a Portuguese version in 2005 which was edited out of a SIC television series, released shortly after the film (the film was by then the most seen Portuguese movie ever, though very badly received by critics, but the TV series, maybe due to being a slightly longer version of the same thing seen by a big share of Portuguese population, flopped and was rather ignored by audiences and critics). Both these adaptations were modernised versions of the novel. In 2023, it was, again, adapted into a 6 episode TV series for RTP Rádio e Televisão de Portugal, now faithfully set in 1860. Amaro is played by &quot;José Condessa&quot;, star of &quot;Netflix&quot; international Hit &quot;Turn of the Tide (TV series)&quot;

Eça&#x27;s works have been also adapted on Brazilian television. In 1988 Rede Globo produced &quot;O Primo Basílio&quot; in 35 episodes. Later, in 2007, a movie adaptation of the same novel was made by director Daniel Filho. In 2001 Rede Globo produced an acclaimed adaptation of &quot;Os Maias&quot; as a television series in 40 episodes.

A movie adaptation of &quot;O Mistério da Estrada de Sintra&quot; was produced in 2007. The director had shortly before directed a series inspired in a whodunit involving the descendants of the original novel&#x27;s characters (&quot;Nome de Código Sintra&quot;, Code Name Sintra), and some of the historical flashback scenes (reporting to the book&#x27;s events) of the series were used in the new movie. The movie was more centered on Eça&#x27;s and Ramalho Ortigão&#x27;s writing and publishing of the original serial and the controversy it created and less around the book&#x27;s plot itself.

In September 2014, film director João Botelho released the film &quot;Os Maias&quot; based on the novel with the same name &quot;Os Maias&quot;. The film cost a million and a half euros, having €600,000 from the Instituto do Cinema e Audiovisual (ICA), €170,000 from Câmara Municipal de Lisboa, €120,000 from Agência Nacional do Cinema (Ancine, the Brazilian akin from ICA), and a good part from Montepio Geral, as well as the purchase by RTP of the rights for the mini-series. The filming happened between October 14 and December 22 in 2013, and was shot in Ponte de Lima, Celorico de Basto, Guimarães and Lisbon.

Galleon Theatre Company, the resident producing company at the Greenwich Playhouse, London, has staged theatre adaptations by Alice de Sousa of Eça de Queiroz&#x27; novels. In 2001 the company presented &quot;Cousin Basílio&quot;, and in 2002 &quot;The Maias&quot;.

<text>Gerda Munsinger (born Gerda Hesler or Heseler or Hessler, also known as Olga Schmidt and Gerda Merkt; September 10, 1929 – November 24, 1998) was an East German prostitute and alleged Soviet spy (although these allegations were ultimately unproven). She immigrated to Canada in 1955. Munsinger was the central protagonist of the Munsinger Affair, the first national political sex scandal in Canada, and was dubbed &quot;the Mata Hari of the Cold War&quot; because of her involvement with several Canadian politicians. She returned to Germany in 1961, became the centre of press attention in 1966 when the scandal was publicly revealed, and was the subject of a feature film.

==Biography==
Munsinger was born in Königsberg, East Prussia (modern Kaliningrad, Russia), on or around September 10, 1929. Little is definitively known of her early life. Her father was reported to be a member of the Communist Party of Germany, and was killed in 1943. She was drafted as a labour worker in 1944, around the same time that her younger brother mysteriously disappeared; she also lost contact with her mother and sister. In an interview she stated that she was until 1948 a prisoner in a &quot;Russian concentration camp&quot;; she also reported being raped by the Soviet soldiers who invaded Germany at the end of the Second World War. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage&quot; notes that &quot;there appeared to Western intelligence officers some indications&quot; that Munsinger served as a Soviet spy during this period and that she at one time lived with a KGB officer. She crossed the border between East and West Germany on several occasions, and as a result was reportedly arrested for espionage by the American border police in 1949. Shortly thereafter, she began learning English and worked as a secretary in a hotel, where she provided secretarial services to American president Dwight Eisenhower and his wife.

She applied to emigrate to Canada in 1952 but was rejected because of security concerns; her attempt to enter the US in 1953 was similarly rejected, citing her espionage conviction and &quot;moral turpitude&quot;. She was married for a short period to a demobilized American soldier and baseball player named Michael Munsinger, but divorced him in 1954 after she was unable to return to the US with him. However, she was able to emigrate to Montreal in 1955 under her married name aboard the &quot;Arosa Star&quot;, as the paperwork she completed did not require her to report her maiden name. She worked as a maid for a doctor in a Montreal suburb upon her arrival, in accordance with the terms of the contract she signed prior to departure. Once her term was completed, she found jobs as a waitress, a call girl, and a hostess at the &quot;Chez Paree&quot; nightclub; she also aspired to be a model.

===Munsinger Affair===

Munsinger became involved in relationships with a number of high-ranking Canadian government officials, most notably cabinet ministers George Hees and Pierre Sévigny. She later commented negatively about Hees, suggesting he was &quot;an ex-football star and that&#x27;s it&quot; who was &quot;too sure of himself as a man&quot;; Sévigny, in contrast, she pitied, saying that newspaper reports about him and his family were &quot;nothing but lies&quot; and that &quot;he was the most innocent person in the whole affair&quot;. Sévigny and Hees co-sponsored her application for Canadian citizenship in 1960.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), after learning that the Central Intelligence Agency considered Munsinger to be a &quot;definite security risk&quot;, interrogated her in 1960 and conducted surveillance on her telephone conversations. However, they found no evidence that she had engaged in spying in Canada. She was briefly hospitalized in 1960 and was believed to have leukemia. Munsinger was arrested for trying to cash a bad cheque in 1961 but the charges were dropped; she left shortly thereafter to return to Germany.

Under pressure from Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who had been informed of the situation by the RCMP, Sévigny ended his affair with Munsinger. He resigned quietly from cabinet in 1963 during an election campaign.

The affair became public in March 1966 when Minister of Justice Lucien Cardin mentioned Munsinger&#x27;s name during a debate in Parliament, in response to comments from the Conservatives about security problems in the Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson. The Liberals had been made aware of the affair two years earlier during a review of security cases involving senior government officials; Pearson had opted to not publicize it, and had instructed his cabinet ministers not to discuss it. The media heard about Cardin&#x27;s comments in the House of Commons and began circulating rumours that &quot;Monsignor&quot; was a Québécois priest/mobster. Despite being told by Pearson not to say anything further, Cardin disclosed during a press conference that &quot;Olga&quot; Munsinger had been involved with Conservative politicians; he compared the incident to the affair between John Profumo and Christine Keeler in the UK. One news report later concluded that &quot;a blond playgirl... has thrust Parliament into a state of suspended degradation&quot;.

When the issue was first raised, the government said that Gerda Munsinger had died of leukemia several years earlier. However, this turned out not to be the case. A Canadian reporter with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Robert Reguly, found her alive and well in Munich, West Germany, after locating her phone number in a local phonebook. At that time, she was engaged to German businessman Ernst Wagner. She confirmed her sexual involvement with the Conservative cabinet ministers but denied participating in espionage. Reguly&#x27;s actions in finding and interviewing Munsinger resulted in the first of his three National Newspaper Awards. After the story broke, the police were sent by the German government to guard Munsinger&#x27;s apartment and prevent unauthorized access, as a crowd of reporters camped outside for several days. One German reporter posed as a waiter and paid the owner of the restaurant in Munsinger&#x27;s building to allow him access to her room. Several days later, she gave her first television interview, to CBC&#x27;s Norman DePoe.

A judicial inquiry regarding the politicians&#x27; dalliances with Munsinger found that there had been no security leak resulting from the affair. Munsinger received &quot;over a hundred&quot; letters from Canadians expressing sympathy for the affair.

===Later life===
In 1974, Barbara Frum asked that Munsinger return to Canada for an exclusive interview with CBC Television. Larry Zolf, a journalist who had been caned on-camera by Sévigny in 1966 while attempting to question him about the affair, was tasked with locating her and bringing her to the show. He &quot;snuck her into the Pearson International Airport from where [he] conveniently tipped off the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&quot;, prompting a headline announcing her return. In the interview, Munsinger noted that &quot;as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it wasn&#x27;t a scandal, it was just life&quot; but that &quot;people know better by now&quot; than to become involved in such affairs while in office. She also ridiculed the suggestion that she was a spy and suggested that Pierre Trudeau would have been better able to manage the scandal than Pearson.

Munsinger eventually married for a third time. She spent the rest of her life in relative obscurity under the name Gerda Merkt, and died on November 24, 1998, in Munich.

She had planned to write an autobiography, to be titled &quot;To Whom it may Concern&quot;, but this work was never published.

==Legacy==
Munsinger&#x27;s story inspired Canadian writer and director Brenda Longfellow to create the 1992 feature film &quot;Gerda&quot;. The story also inspired the song &quot;Gerda&quot;, written by the Canadian band The Brothers-in-Law who &quot;specialized in taking satirical musical jabs at Canadian scandals and events&quot;. Similarly, The Evaporators included a song titled &quot;Gerda Munsinger&quot; on their album &quot;Ripple Rock&quot;.

A 1997 article in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; suggested that the elimination of capital punishment in Canada was a direct result of Pearson&#x27;s desire to direct Canadian attention away from Munsinger.

Munsinger was briefly profiled by &quot;Disclosure&quot;, a CBC TV program, in 2001. According to a friend interviewed for the program, Gerda had remarked before her death that &quot;one day, Canadians will again come looking for me&quot;.

<text>Vale Canada Limited (formerly Vale Inco, CVRD Inco and Inco Limited; for corporate branding purposes simply known as &quot;Vale&quot; and pronounced in English) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Brazilian mining company Vale. Vale&#x27;s nickel mining and metals division is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It produces nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, gold, and silver. Prior to being purchased by CVRD (now Vale) in 2006, Inco was the world&#x27;s second largest producer of nickel, and the third largest mining company outside South Africa and Russia of platinum group metals. It was also a charter member of the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average formed on October 1, 1928.

==History==

===Founding of Inco===
The company was founded following the discovery by blacksmith Tom Flanagan in Copper Cliff, Ontario of chalcopyrite deposits, while the Canadian Pacific Railway was being built in 1883; the township of Sudbury soon followed in 1884 when JL Morris, provincial land surveyor, laid it out. Initially, ore was shipped for smelting to a plant in Constable Hook, New Jersey, owned by the Orford Copper Company. Processing revealed in 1884 that the ore was also rich in nickel and exploration tests revealed an enormous potential. In 1893 Robert M. Thompson patented the Orford &quot;Tops and Bottoms&quot; process; this was the first commercially viable method of separating Pentlandite-borne Nickel from the CuFeS2 Chalcopyrite-borne Copper.

The Spanish-American War focused the eyes of the world on nickel steel, because in the Battle of Manila Bay and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, the American losses were negligible while the Spanish losses were catastrophic. This was the result of the nickel steel used by the Americans to clad their hulls. The Spanish Navy had ignored to their peril the 1889 paper by James Riley, &quot;Alloys of Nickel and Steel&quot;, and the market for nickel was made. The next year saw the introduction by Bethlehem Steel of a virtually indestructible nickel steel automobile axle.

Nickel mining started in Sudbury, Ontario in 1902, and that year, the International Nickel Company, Ltd. was created by Thompson and John Pierpont Morgan in New York, NY as a joint venture between Canadian Copper Company, Orford Copper Company, and American Nickel Works, with a capitalization of $28 million. In 1905, Monel alloy was discovered by Robert Crooks Stanley (1876-1951) and named for Inco President Ambrose Monell. Meanwhile, the development of austenitic stainless steel was launched by a pair of Krupp engineers known today as AISI Type 304 or simply 18/8, which indicates a nickel content of 8%. This novelty would assure the 20th-century success of the firm.

In 1916, the International Nickel Company of Canada, Ltd. was incorporated in Copper Cliff in Sudbury; this entity was a subsidiary of New York-based Inco. The company built a new refinery in Port Colborne in 1918 and during the following year, the company first began using the trade name Inco.

On 31 October 1928 the Canadian body corporate and its American parent switched roles and the Canadian became the parent. On 1 January 1929 the corporation acquired the British-owned Mond Nickel Company in exchange for treasury shares, to solve the Frood Mine problem. By 1931, Stanley had progressed to President of the firm. Between 1935 and 1939, sales exceeded 200 million pounds annually, which
was more than 80% of world consumption. A significant proportion of these sales found their way to the United States, with other notable markets including the Soviet Union, Great Britain, Japan, and Germany. Approximately 9 percent of company&#x27;s total sales from 1934 to 1939 were to Nazi Germany, mainly to meet the growing demand of the country&#x27;s armaments industry.

===Head office to Toronto===

When Robert Crooks Stanley became president of INCO in 1922, priority was given to high quality research. A head office for the Canadian operations of Inco was soon established in Toronto. In 1922 Stanley closed the Bayonne NJ refinery in favour of the new electrolytic one in Port Colborne, Ontario, while at Alfred Mond&#x27;s nickel carbonyl refinery in Acton, London Inco was able to produce platinum. As early as 1930, Canadian Industries Limited (CIL) had a sulfuric acid plant located in Copper Cliff; its product, which came in synergy with the smelter there, was used in CIL&#x27;s Nobel, Ontario gunpowder factory.

Stanley&#x27;s excellent contribution to Inco was his devotion to alloy research, which contributed to the expansion of the market for the base metals it produced. In his first Annual Report in 1922 after becoming President, Stanley informed the shareowners of the new Development and Research Department. At the same time, management told the directors that &quot;we had no market developed [for Monel] which would justify a mill, but we assured them that with a mill we could build a market which would earn the preferred dividend.&quot; The directors thereupon invested three quarters of all the liquid resources of the company into the Huntington WV plant to satisfy a market which management had just said did not exist. The Monel alloy family grew into more than a dozen members, and Duranickel, Permanickel, Ni-span-C, Inconel X and Nimonic were all discovered under his watch, most at his Huntington Works baby.

JL Agnew originated the Geology Department of the firm, as a result of his investigations into the Frood Mine problem, which precipitated the 1929 merger with the Mond Company. This department was instrumental in the Manitoba discovery 25 years after his death.

On 1 April 1929 the Ontario Refining Company (ORC) was formed in a joint venture between the American Metal Company, the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, Inco and Ventures Limited (which was the parent of Falconbridge Limited). The first and third named companies had each a 42% share. By June 1935 the ORC, which worked at the electrolysis of copper, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Inco. The &quot;Inco Triangle&quot;, a monthly newsletter for the company, had its first issue of eight pages in September 1936. 

During World War II, Inco&#x27;s Frood Mine produced 40% of the nickel used in artillery by the Allies. From 1939 to 1945, Inco delivered to the Allies 1.5 billion pounds of nickel. During the war it almost doubled its yearly output of ore. After the war, demand for nickel remained high because of the Korean War and the Cold War of the 1950s.

Because of the Mond merger, Inco had ownership of nickel properties in Petsamo Province, Finland (now known as Pechengsky District) and had invested a fair sum in them. These properties were conquered by the Soviet Union during the Winter War of 1939-40. As a result reparations needed to be negotiated between Inco and the Soviet Union, through the Canadian government after 1944. The parties settled for $20 million, which was paid with difficulty.

Also because of the Mond merger Inco was the owner of the Nimonic technology that allowed gas turbines and jet propulsion engines to function. This research was performed during 1940 at the request of the Air Ministry of the British government for materials that would withstand the elevated temperatures seen in these applications.

Also during World War 2 was developed ductile iron, by Keith Millis, Albert Gagnebin and Norman Boden Pilling. The scientists were curious to replace chromium as an alloy agent in abrasion-resistant cast iron and they stumbled upon the amazing ductile property of magnesium-treated iron, which transforms carbon flakes into spheroids and thus ductilizes the whole.

In 1948 Sproule and Harcourt patented ( and ) a new development of the Orford process, in which careful cooling of the matte enabled the precipitation of a small amount of nickel-copper alloy which contains platinum group metals besides. This is crushed, finely ground and treated by flotation and magnetic separation to part the constituents. This work was the culmination of experiments begun in Copper Cliff by Roy Gordon in March 1938 and was one of the reasons why his career ascent was so meteoric.

In its heyday during the 1950s, Inco produced 85% of the world&#x27;s nickel supply. In 1956, geologists discovered the Thompson, Manitoba ore body and named it for Inco Chairman John Fairfield Thompson. The first Canadian-born President of Inco, who held the office between 1960 and 1966, was named James Roycroft Gordon.

The year 1969 saw a bloody four-month long strike at Inco&#x27;s Sudbury operations, and the firm&#x27;s share price was cut in half.

In 1972, it was decided by Chairman L. Edward Grubb, ostensibly to pacify the labour unions, to move the head office from New York to Toronto where it resided in the Toronto Dominion Centre. Also in 1972 the Inco Superstack was built in Sudbury; at the time senior technical staff like Paul Queneau thought this would solve the SO2 acid rain pollution problem. And in 1972, the Soroko project in Indonesia was begun together with involvement from six Japanese firms who together held a 40% share in the project.

In July 1974 Chairman L. Edward Grubb decided to diversify Inco&#x27;s holdings and make the first ever hostile takeover bid for Philadelphia-based Electric Storage Battery Company (ESB), aided by Morgan Stanley. United Aircraft Corporation entered as white knight and served to increase Grubb&#x27;s bid to a 110 percent premium above the pretakeover price. The merger was characterized as a &quot;major blunder&quot; and by December 1981 Inco was looking to exit the battery business. In February 1983 Inco sold most of its holdings in Exide and exited the battery business. ESB manufactured amongst other products the Ray-O-Vac battery.

The 1975 Inco annual report had a picture of a supersonic Concorde jet which used nickel and titanium alloy blades forged by Daniel Doncaster and Sons, a 1975 acquisition of Inco (Alloy Products) division. A picture of Prince Charles talking with a Doncaster operator of electronic blade inspection equipment lies alongside it. In 1976, the company’s name was officially changed to Inco Limited.

Inco also built and operated a facility that included a research center overlooking Blue Lake in New York&#x27;s Sterling Forest area. That site was sold in the 1980s.

===Downturn===
During the first half of the 1980s Inco bled a lot of red ink, &quot;which caused the elimination during the five years from 1980 of more than 12,000 jobs worldwide, or 35 percent of its work force, including more than 6,000 jobs in Canada.&quot; It then produced one-third of the world&#x27;s nickel. Charles F. Baird was the chairman and CEO. By 1985 Inco (Alloy Products) division included: Doncasters Blaenavon Ltd Special Alloy Products Division, Doncasters Monk Bridge Ltd, Doncasters Sheffield Ltd, Doncasters Moorside Ltd, Beaufort Engineering Ltd, Whittingham and Porter Ltd, I.A.P.L. Technology Centre and Inco Selective Surfaces Ltd.

The SO2 abatement project (SOAP) instigated a $600 million clean-sheet recomposition of the smelter plant that allowed INCO to capture 90% of their emissions, and commercialize sulfuric acid.

In late 1994, Diamond Field Resources discovered nickel, copper and cobalt ore bodies at Voisey&#x27;s Bay Mine (VBM) in Labrador, Canada. The deposit was estimated to contain 141 million tonnes at 1.6% nickel and was imagined by the then-chieftains of Inco as a 21st-century replacement for the waning Copper Cliff resource. In 1996, the VBM was purchased by Inco for 4.3 billion Canadian dollars. Some say that Inco overpaid for VBM because of the presence of Falconbridge at the auction.

In order to generate cash Inco sold its manufacturing sites of nickel alloys to Special Metals Corporation in 1998 for US$408 million. In the previous year, the division had generated US$668 million in revenue. Special Metals Corporation however filed Chapter 11 in March 2002.

In February 2001, nine-year CEO Michael Sopko stepped down while he announced a $400 million profit. He was replaced by New York lawyer Scott Hand.
In 2002, the VBM purchase was regarded as a &quot;costly blunder... when the company had to write down a third of the value of the $4-billion acquisition only six years after the purchase,&quot; but in early 2004 that did not prevent Hand from making a bid for Noranda and Falconbridge, both of which were at the time owned by Brascan, who then declined the Inco offer. The bait in the water attracted Mick Davis and Roger Agnelli. Hand was not deterred from his takeover madness and went to Australia to try his luck in the Western Mining sweepstakes, where he was outbid by XStrata&#x27;s offer of US$5.7 billion and the ultimately successful BHP Billiton bid of $7.3 billion. Not last in the waters was Teck Cominco&#x27;s Don Lindsay, a product of CIBC World Markets and who had advised Falconbridge in their failed acquisition of VBM.

===Takeovers (2005–2006)===
On October 11, 2005, Inco&#x27;s CEO Scott Hand announced a friendly takeover bid to buy out the operations of longtime rival Falconbridge for $12 billion. If approved, the deal would have made Inco the world&#x27;s largest producer of nickel. Davis&#x27;s Xstrata (which already owned ~20% of Falconbridge shares) subsequently submitted a hostile takeover bid for Falconbridge, resulting in a bidding war between Inco and Xstrata. The Xstrata bid was successful, but not before Falconbridge employed a poison pill to delay the acquisition, raising its share price from $28 to $62.50 in the meantime.

Teck Cominco submitted a hostile takeover bid to purchase Inco on May 8, 2006 for $16 billion if it agreed to abandon its takeover of Falconbridge. On June 26 of the same year, Phelps Dodge submitted a friendly takeover bid to purchase a combined Inco and Falconbridge for around $40 billion; that offer was also withdrawn because of the failure of the Inco-Falconbridge merger.

On August 14, 2006 Brazilian mining company Vale S.A. (aka CVRD) extended an all-cash offer to buy Inco for $17 billion. That offer received approval from the Canadian government&#x27;s investment review agency on October 19, and was accepted by Inco shareholders on October 23. Part of the takeover deal was that CVRD would operate Inco as a separate nickel mining division; all of CVRD&#x27;s nickel operations, including mines at Onca Puma and Vermelho in Brazil, were transferred to Inco&#x27;s management. Inco was delisted from the NYSE on November 16, 2006 and the TSX on January 5, 2007. According to its current web site, Inco is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Vale (formerly CVRD).

===As subsidiary===
The 2009-10 Vale-Inco strike lasted 15 months; one of the longest on record in Canada.

In May 2010, Vale changed the name of Vale-Inco to simply Vale, stating the change is &quot;a milestone that aligns it more fully with other Vale operations worldwide and reflects its position as part of the world’s second largest mining company&quot;.

In 2015, Vale was said to be exploring an IPO of its base metals unit for $30–35 billion, in order to lighten its debt load.

===Reorganisation as VBM===
In May 2023 it was announced that Mark Cutifani would be appointed as Chair of the new Vale Base Metals (VBM) subsidiary of global mining giant Vale S.A.. Vale was looking to divest from its tar baby, as early as December 2022. At the time VBM was a supplier to Tesla and General Motors (GM). Reports were afoot that GM, Mitsui, and the Saudi Public Investment Fund were interested buyers of a 10% stake. Former Tesla executive Jerome Guillen would join the &quot;energy transition board&quot; of VBM along with Cutifani.

In May 2023 it was announced that VBM had entered a joint venture with the Ford Motor Company and Huayou Cobalt on a $4.5bn nickel processing facility in Indonesia.

Vale spun out its metals business as a separate ringfenced entity headquartered in Toronto, with an independent board chaired by Cutifani. That process completed in July 2023. The unit was then one of the world’s largest producers of nickel, copper, and cobalt, and had operations across the globe. The parent company&#x27;s chief executive Eduardo Bartolomeo stated that Cutifani could help the division explore a future “liquidity event”. In early 2023, the parent company earned 80% of its profits in its South American iron mines, and the balance from its Base Metals group.

In July 2023 Cutifani sold off 10% of the capital to the Saudi Public Investment Fund and 3% to Engine No. 1. The value of the transaction was $3.4 billion.

As of May 2024, Vale Canada was reported to have a sales agreement with &quot;Xstrata Copper Canada&quot; for the sale of copper anodes and copper concentrates produced in Sudbury.

==Criticism==
In 2006 Inco was removed from the FTSE4Good Index for failing to meet their human rights criteria. The company has had disputes with native groups and environmental concerns over mine runoff.

==Labour relations==
Employees for Inco in Canada are represented by the United Steelworkers throughout all the mergers. Because of the mergers, the United Steelworkers signed an agreement with all the unions that represent mining workers in countries where Vale/Inco operate to &quot;work together cooperatively and strategically as global partners, to build the bargaining power of worker.&quot; The unions include Confederação Nacional dos Trabalhadores no Setor Minera, SINTICIM, Union syndicale des ouvriers et employés de Nouvelle-Calédonie, Union des Syndicats des Travailleurs Kanak et Exploités, Fagforbundet for Industri og Energi, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, and the United Steelworkers.

===Indonesia===
*Vale Inco&#x27;s Indonesian joint venture PT Vale Indonesia Tbk, an Indonesian company which is 20 percent publicly owned (IDX:INCO), is located in Soroako. In August 2011, a dispute began because PT Inco broke its promise to build 2 smelters in Pomala and Bahodopi in 2005 and 2010 respectively, and to hand over 50,000 hectares of its 118,000-hectare concession to locals. Based on the latest feasibility study, only the Bahodopi smelter facility was possible. The dispute might go to court.
*October 11, 2011: After starting operation of its third hydropower plant at Karebbe with an output of 130 megawatts (MW), the company would increase production from 73,000 metric tons to 120,000 metric tons per year over the next five years. The first and second hydropower plants are located in Larona and Balambano with a combined output of 365 MW. As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility plan, the company has given a total of 8 MW from the plants to Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Indonesian Government Electric Company) for free.

==In popular culture==
Inco is a central theme in the Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors song &quot;Sudbury Saturday Night&quot;. More recently, the Creighton Mine, owned by Vale and hosting the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, figures largely in the plot of Robert J. Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;Neanderthal Parallax&quot; trilogy.

<text>Yisrael Meir ha-Kohen Kagan (February 6, 1838 – September 15, 1933) was an influential Lithuanian Jewish rabbi, Halakhist, posek, and ethicist whose works continue to be widely influential in Orthodox Jewish life. He was known popularly as the Chofetz Chaim, after his book on lashon hara, who was also well known for the Mishna Berurah, his book on ritual law.

==Biography==
Kagan was born on February 6, 1838 in Dzienciol (), Grodno Governorate in Russian Empire (today Dzyatlava in Belarus), and died on 15 September 1933 in Raduń (), Nowogródek Voivodeship in Second Polish Republic (now in Belarus). When Kagan was ten years old, his father died in a cholera epidemic at the age of 46. His mother moved the family to Vilnius in order to continue her son&#x27;s Jewish education. While in Vilnius, Kagan became a student of Jacob Barit. Kagan&#x27;s mother remarried and moved to Radin, taking the name of her new husband, Poupko, which the young Kagan adopted as well. At 17, he married the daughter of his stepfather, and settled in Radin. Later in life, he would revert his name back to Kagan. This is why there are a number of letters of his extant that he signed as Poupko and others as Kagan. When Kagan arrived in Vilnius, Rav Chaim Nachman Parnas, who had known Kagan&#x27;s father well, was friendly to him. Reb Yisrael Gordon, a friend of Parnas, took the young Kagan into his home and paid him to learn with Gordon&#x27;s son, Mordechai.

He served as the town rabbi of Radin for a short period. He then resigned from this position to establish a yeshiva in the city, which eventually became world-famous first being led by the notable Naftoli Trop, followed by the esteemed son-in-law of his rabbi, Mendel Zaks. By all accounts, he was a modest and humble man, faithfully devoted to his Jewish faith. For a while, he had a shop selling household provisions, which he and his wife managed. From 1864 to 1869 he taught Talmud in Minsk and Vashilishok.

In 1869, Kagan formed a yeshiva in Radin. The yeshiva was a success and grew to prominence, later becoming known as &quot;Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim of Radin&quot;. In addition to spreading Torah through his yeshiva, Kagan, who became known as &quot;the Chofetz Chaim&quot;, was very active in Jewish causes. He traveled extensively to encourage the observance of Mitzvot and Shabbat amongst Jews. He became one of the most influential rabbis within Orthodox Judaism during the late 19th and early 20th century, taking a central leadership role in the World Agudath Israel movement in Eastern Europe. An author of many works of musar literature, he was sometimes associated with the Musar movement, although he did not support all aspects of that movement.

Although the anti-religious attitudes which pervaded Zionism greatly distressed him, Kagan initially refused to become personally involved in the matter and refrained from publicly denouncing the movement. When his views became known, he cautioned his students about joining the Zionists and declared its political aims as being contrary to the Torah. Kagan famously said that it would be preferable to lose a third of the amount of Torah we have throughout the world rather than join the WZO (World Zionist Organization). Elchonon Wasserman (killed in the Holocaust 6 July 1941) said that this means even if the majority of yeshivos would have to close, we would not be allowed to join the WZO. In 1903, his wife Frieda died, and two years later he married the daughter of Hillel of Lapis, Miriam Freida, who was more than thirty years younger than him. It was from this marriage that his son Aharon Kagan and his daughter Feigl Chaya Sacks were born. His son-in-law was Mendel Zaks.

In 1925, it was announced that he would be leaving Warsaw with his daughter and son-in-law to permanently settle in Petach Tikvah (the Gate of Hope, in Hebrew), in Palestine. Upon discovering his plans, prominent rabbis and &quot;yeshiva&quot; deans persuaded him to remain in Radin and he died there on September 15, 1933, aged 95. He was interred in the nearby cemetery. Miriam Freida arrived in Montreal with her son Aharon via Siberia and Japan in 1942, and died in New York in 1946.

Many other Jewish religious institutions throughout the world also bear his name. One American yeshiva named in his honor is the Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen centered in Queens, New York founded by his great nephew, Dovid Leibowitz, with several branches in the United States, Canada, and Israel. Kagan&#x27;s teachings have inspired some English-speaking American Jews to establish the Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation, dedicated to the dissemination of his teachings to Jewish communities around the world. An Orthodox kibbutz in Israel, Hafetz Haim, was named in his honor.

During his lifetime, Kagan was venerated by Jews and non-Jews alike. Orthodox Jews across the world viewed him as one of the 36 righteous people, and Polish farmers were said to have lured him into their fields believing his feet would bring blessing to their crops.

According to some reports, despite his rabbinic leadership he did not hold &quot;semikhah&quot; until late in life, when he had to apply for a passport and needed formal &quot;semichah&quot; in order to honestly enter &quot;rabbi&quot; as his occupation. He then received his &quot;semikhah&quot; by telegraph from Chaim Ozer Grodzinski of Wilna. According to another report, though, he received &quot;semikhah&quot; much earlier, at age 17.

==Works==

* &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot; ( &quot;Seeker/Desirer [of] Life&quot;), his first book, (published in 1873), deals with the Biblical laws of gossip and slander (known in Hebrew as &quot;Lashon Hara&quot;, meaning &quot;Evil tongue&quot;). View the online edition in Hebrew here
* &quot;Shemirat HaLashon&quot; (&quot;Guarding of the Tongue&quot;), is a comprehensive discussion of the philosophy behind the Jewish concepts of power of speech and guarding one&#x27;s speech. It also serves as an inspirational work designed to motivate the reader to be vigilant in the ethical usage of his speech and avoidance of others&#x27; unethical speech. Published in 1876. View the online edition in Hebrew here
* &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; (&quot;Clarified teachings&quot;) is an important and widely used commentary, consisting of six volumes, on the Orach Chayim section of Yosef Karo&#x27;s digested compilation of practical Jewish Law, the Shulchan Aruch. It combines his own elucidations and differing opinions with those of other Aharonim (post-medieval authorities.) [As found in the book by Moses M. Yoshor &quot;The Chafetz Chaim&quot; on page 603 the 1st volume was published in 1884; 2nd volume in 1886; 3rd volume in 1891; 4th volume in 1898; 5th volume in 1902; 6th volume in 1907.]
* &quot;Biur Halacha&quot; (&quot;Explanation of the Law&quot;) is a commentary tangential to the &quot;Mishna Berurah&quot;. It usually provides complex analysis of the legal rulings of earlier Jewish halachic authorities.
* &quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaTziyyun&quot; (&quot;Gate of Distinction&quot;) serves primarily to document sources for laws and customs quoted in the &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot;, but sometimes serves also to clarify ambiguous legal statements. The name &quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaTziyyun&quot; derives from the phrase &quot;sh&#x27;arim m&#x27;tzuyanim ba&#x27;halacha&quot;, translated as &quot;gateways distinguished in (or marked in) Jewish Law,&quot; referring to the Torah study and scholarship that would distinguish Jewish homes. Kagan chose the title as a pun, hinting at the distinction of the scholarship referenced in his work, but primarily referring to (as he writes on his title page) the function of &quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaTziyyun&quot; to document (mark) sources.
* &quot;Ahavat Chesed&quot; – one volume, published in 1888. On the commandment of lending money to the needy, the value of being kind to one another and various ways to do so.
* &quot;Machaneh Yisrael&quot; – one volume, on the minimum requirements of Torah observance for soldiers in the army.
* &quot;Tiferes Odom&quot; – one volume, on the importance of a Jew having a beard and peyos (sidelocks).
* &quot;Geder Olam&quot; – one volume, published in 1890. On the importance of a married Jewish woman covering her hair.
* &quot;Nidchei Yisrael&quot; – two volumes, published in 1893.
* &quot;Shem Olam&quot; – one volume, published in 1893.

* &quot;Chomas Hadas&quot; – one volume, published in 1905. On the importance of a man to study Torah, and encourage others to learn, as well as the need to create groups in every city wherein a man could acquire Torah.
* &quot;Likutei Halachos&quot;, a halakhic digest of all &quot;sugyot&quot; on which there was no &quot;Rif&quot; or &quot;Rosh&quot;; originally intended to encourage the study of the laws of the Temple service. Five volumes: the first volume was published in 1900; 2nd volume in 1903; 3rd volume in 1913; 4th volume in 1922. There is a fifth volume called &quot;Hashlamah&quot; or &quot;Completion&quot; which was published in 1925.
* &quot;Gibores Ari&quot; – two volumes, published in 1907.
* &quot;Tohoras Yisroel&quot; – one volume, published in 1910. On the importance of women to purify themselves in the waters of a &quot;mikvah&quot; (ritual bath) in accordance with accepted &quot;halachic&quot; practice.
* &quot;Toras Kohanim&quot; – one volume, published in 1911. A commentary on Sifra (halachic midrash on the book of Leviticus).
* &quot;Asefas Zekenim&quot; – three volumes, published in 1913.
* &quot;Chovas Hashemiro&quot; – one volume, published in 1915.
* &quot;Toras Habayis&quot; – one volume, published in 1923.
* &quot;Zechor Lemiryom&quot; – one volume, published in 1925.
* &quot;Beis Yisroel&quot; – one volume, published in 1925.
* &quot;Sefer Hamitzvos Hakotzor&quot; – two volumes on those Biblical commandments that are applicable during the Exile, outside the land of Israel, and when the Temple is not in existence. Published in 1931.
* &quot;Tzipita Lishuah&quot; (&quot;Have you yearned for the redemption&quot;) is based on a passage from tractate Shabbat, which states that after one passes away, he is asked by the heavenly court: &quot;Have you yearned for the redemption?&quot; This work describes the importance of actively awaiting Moshiach every day and doing everything in one&#x27;s power (learning Torah and doing mitzvot) to bring the redemption. The Chofetz Chaim&#x27;s expectation of the immediate redemption was so strong that he would always carry special garments to change into once the redemption began.

<text>A cDNA library is a combination of cloned cDNA (complementary DNA) fragments inserted into a collection of host cells, which constitute some portion of the transcriptome of the organism and are stored as a &quot;library&quot;. cDNA is produced from fully transcribed mRNA found in the nucleus and therefore contains only the expressed genes of an organism. Similarly, tissue-specific cDNA libraries can be produced. In eukaryotic cells the mature mRNA is already spliced, hence the cDNA produced lacks introns and can be readily expressed in a bacterial cell. While information in cDNA libraries is a powerful and useful tool since gene products are easily identified, the libraries lack information about enhancers, introns, and other regulatory elements found in a genomic DNA library.

== cDNA Library Construction ==
cDNA is created from a mature mRNA from a eukaryotic cell with the use of reverse transcriptase. In eukaryotes, a poly-(A) tail (consisting of a long sequence of adenine nucleotides) distinguishes mRNA from tRNA and rRNA and can therefore be used as a primer site for reverse transcription. This has the problem that not all transcripts, such as those for the histone, encode a poly-A tail.

=== mRNA extraction ===
Firstly, mRNA template needs to be isolated for the creation of cDNA libraries. Since mRNA only contains exons, the integrity of the isolated mRNA should be considered so that the protein encoded can still be produced. Isolated mRNA should range from 500 bp to 8 kb. Several methods exist for purifying RNA such as trizol extraction and column purification. Column purification can be done using oligomeric dT nucleotide coated resins, and features of mRNA such as having a poly-A tail can be exploited where only mRNA sequences containing said feature will bind. The desired mRNA bound to the column is then eluted. 

=== cDNA construction ===
Once mRNA is purified, an &quot;oligo-dT&quot; primer (a short sequence of deoxy-thymidine nucleotides) is bound to the poly-A tail of the RNA. The primer is required to initiate DNA synthesis by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This results in the creation of RNA-DNA hybrids where a single strand of complementary DNA is bound to a strand of mRNA. To remove the mRNA, the RNAse H enzyme is used to cleave the backbone of the mRNA and generate free 3&#x27;-OH groups, which is important for the replacement of mRNA with DNA. DNA polymerase I is then added, the cleaved RNA acts as a primer the DNA polymerase I can identify and initiate replacement of RNA nucleotides with those of DNA. This is provided by the sscDNA itself by coiling on itself at the 3&#x27; end, generating a &quot;hairpin loop&quot;. The polymerase extends the 3&#x27;-OH end, and later the loop at 3&#x27; end is opened by the scissoring action of &quot;S1 nuclease&quot;. Restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase are then used to clone the sequences into bacterial plasmids.

The cloned bacteria are then selected, commonly through the use of antibiotic selection. Once selected, stocks of the bacteria are created which can later be grown and sequenced to compile the cDNA library.

== cDNA Library uses ==
cDNA libraries are commonly used when reproducing eukaryotic genomes, as the amount of information is reduced to remove the large numbers of non-coding regions from the library. cDNA libraries are used to express eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes do not have introns in their DNA and therefore do not possess any enzymes that can cut it out during transcription process. cDNA does not have introns and therefore can be expressed in prokaryotic cells. cDNA libraries are most useful in reverse genetics where the additional genomic information is of less use. Additionally, cDNA libraries are frequently used in functional cloning to identify genes based on the encoded protein&#x27;s function. When studying eukaryotic DNA, expression libraries are constructed using complementary DNA (cDNA) to help ensure the insert is truly a gene. 

=== cDNA Library vs. Genomic DNA Library ===
cDNA library lacks the non-coding and regulatory elements found in genomic DNA. Genomic DNA libraries provide more detailed information about the organism, but are more resource-intensive to generate and keep.

== Cloning of cDNA ==
cDNA molecules can be cloned by using restriction site linkers. Linkers are short, double stranded pieces of DNA (oligodeoxyribonucleotide) about 8 to 12 nucleotide pairs long that include a restriction endonuclease cleavage site e.g. BamHI. Both the cDNA and the linker have blunt ends which can be ligated together using a high concentration of T4 DNA ligase. Then sticky ends are produced in the cDNA molecule by cleaving the cDNA ends (which now have linkers with an incorporated site) with the appropriate endonuclease. A cloning vector (plasmid) is then also cleaved with the appropriate endonuclease. Following &quot;sticky end&quot; ligation of the insert into the vector the resulting recombinant DNA molecule is transferred into &quot;E. coli&quot; host cell for cloning.

<doc id="544642" wikidata="Q5032783" url="?curid=544642" title="Cannon River (Minnesota)">
<text>The Cannon River is a tributary of the Mississippi River that flows from Shields Lake near Shieldsville to Red Wing in the U.S. state of Minnesota, where it joins the Mississippi River. It drains a watershed approximately 1460 square miles (3,780 km²) in size. The river flows through the counties of Le Sueur, Rice, Dakota, and Goodhue.

The Cannon River has few rapids, but some can be difficult (Class II). Some have claimed lives, as has the confluence with the Little Cannon River in Cannon Falls. Canoes traversing the river must portage several dams; the low header dams are more dangerous than they appear to novices. Downed trees and logjams are extreme hazards in high water, as are low bridges. The river varies in width from 50 to 200 feet (15 to 60 m).

==Water characteristics==

Stream flow usually peaks in early April. Very heavy rains can cause the river to flood. The dam at Lake Byllesby does not affect water levels and canoeing downstream, because it maintains instantaneous flow-through. From Faribault, Minnesota to its mouth, the Cannon, a designated Minnesota Wild and Scenic River falls 280 feet (85 m), an average of 4.8 feet/mile (1 m/km). In its upper course, the river flows through the lake region of western Rice County. The chief tributary of the Cannon River is the Straight River, which enters the Cannon in Faribault. The Straight River is an important and scenic river in its own right. It originates in southern Steele County at Oak Glen Lake near Bixby.

==Landscape==
Bounded by rolling hills, bluffs, farmland, and woods in its upper reaches, dammed by H.M. Byllesby in 1910 for hydroelectric power to create Lake Byllesby Reservoir, the Cannon enters a broad gorge below Cannon Falls, where it is flanked by bluffs up to 300 feet (100 m) high. The Cannon River is underlaid with a variety of sedimentary rocks. The river valley was created by cutting through these rocks produced rock outcrops of St. Peter Sandstone, the Prairie du Chien Group of dolomites and sandstone, and near the river&#x27;s mouth, Jordan Sandstone and the St. Lawrence and Franconia formations.

Past the Falls, the river is in the Driftless Area of Minnesota, a region that remained ice free during the last ice age, allowing the river to carve a very impressive canyon. The upper region of the river is involved with terminal moraines and glacial drift and till, and is not in the Driftless Area.

==Animals and plants==
In the reservoirs and slow stretches above Faribault the most common game fish are northern pike, black crappies, bluegills, and bullheads. Downstream from Faribault the most common species are smallmouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and, in the stretch below Cannon Falls, Minnesota, channel catfish. Wildlife seen in the river valley includes white-tailed deer, beavers, otters, raccoons, bobcats, red fox, gray fox, and coyotes. Bald eagles are sighted near the Mississippi River.

The Dwarf Trout Lily is a rare plant present only in the Cannon River watershed.
==Cultural information==
Evidence of human activity along &quot;Iŋ&#x27;yaŋ Bosdata&quot; (or &quot;Standing Rock River&quot; as the Cannon is named in the Dakota language) goes back at least 12,000 years. By C.E. 1000 the Mississippian culture, a tradition heavily dependent on agriculture, was established in southern Minnesota. An important part of the yearly cycle was the hunting of buffalo west of the Mississippi and the Big Woods. The Cannon served as a primary route from the Mississippi River valley to the plains of western Minnesota where bison were common. The Dakota were forced to surrender the area in the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and most Dakota (except for a small group south of Faribault) left the area after the Dakota War of 1862. The &quot;Standing Rock&quot; of the Dakota language name is Castle Rock, located two miles east of the unincorporated community of Castle Rock.

The mouth of the Cannon River was a major center of this culture. In historic times Indians and traders frequently hid their canoes near the river&#x27;s mouth, and so French fur traders called the stream La Riviere aux Canots, &quot;the river of canoes.&quot; The modern name came from a false homophone of French &quot;Canot&quot;.
In 1877 there were 15 flour mills along the stretch of river between Faribault and Northfield alone. At Dundas, travelers still can see the aging limestone walls of the Archibald Mill. The Cannon River also flows through the Science Center at the Maltby Nature Preserve in Randolph, Minnesota.

&quot;Adapted from the Minnesota DNR web site&quot;

==Historic Industries==
Ingenious Cannon Valley flour millers harnessed the power of the Cannon to run their simple country grist mills. In a scant few decades during the mid-to-late 19th Century, more innovations in the flour milling industry were developed here than in several centuries before. Their inventions and processes figuratively changed the face of milling around the world. The first mills they built at Faribault, Morristown, Dundas, Northfield, Cannon Falls and Red Wing became the first bona fide industry that helped grow the Cannon Valley&#x27;s first economy. These people, John North, John T. Archibald, Alexander Faribault, Edmund LaCroix, and Captain Jesse Ames, to name a few, had much to do with advancing the newer technology, thereby establishing the first towns along the Cannon River.
Remnants of the earliest mill companies live on through Malt-O-Meal and in textile milling at the Faribault Woolen Mill.

==Parks and Recreation==
The Cannon Valley Trail runs along the south bank of the river, between Cannon Falls and Red Wing and provides scenic views of surrounding farmland and the river valley. Sakatah Lake State Park is on a natural widening of the river near Waterville.
The 40-mile Sakatah-Singing Hills Trail begins at Faribault at the White Sands Trailhead facility, winding its way west along the Cannon River, past several lakes connected by it, ending at Mankato. The four-season asphalt pathway is a remnant of the Cannon Valley Railroad built in the 1880s.

<doc id="544643" wikidata="Q1426511" url="?curid=544643" title="National Women's Hockey League (1999–2007)">
<text>The National Women&#x27;s Hockey League (NWHL) was a women&#x27;s ice hockey league established in Canada in service from 1999 to 2007. In its final season the league was run by the Ontario Women&#x27;s Hockey Association.

==History==
The NWHL superseded the old Central Ontario Women&#x27;s Hockey League in 1998–99. After the old COWHL dropped down to three teams in 1997–98, the new league expanded to Brampton, Ottawa and the Montreal area (Montreal, Bonaventure and Laval) in 1998–99. The league was officially renamed the National Women&#x27;s Hockey League on February 16, 1999 with Susan Fennell as the league&#x27;s first president/Commissioner. In the inaugural season, the Beatrice Aeros won the West Division while the Bonaventure Wingstar won the East Division. 
Under Commissioner Fennell, the NWHL transformed to independent owners with the League negotiating to have cross Canada live television broadcast for the finals. Michael Charbon (MAC Productions) worked with the Commissioner to secure broadcast times with WTN. Games were played in Brampton&#x27;s Powerade Centre (now called &quot;The CAA Centre&quot;), coinciding with the Brampton Canadettes world&#x27;s largest hockey tournament, which brought together teams from all ages and from across North America to compete. A special highlight was attending the Championship Cup games of the NWHL.

Michael Charbon designed the NWHL Logo in the same colors of the NHL logo. Commissioner Fennell sought the approval from Gary Bettman, the NHL Commissioner, and it was granted.

Commissioner Fennell was instrumental in having the Championship Cup purchased and engraved annually with the Champion Team players names, coaches, and even volunteers.

During the NHL strike there was talk that the women should be able to play for the Stanley Cup. Instead, Commissioner Fennell initiated talks with Governor General Adrianne Clarkson and requested consideration to rename the Championship Cup the &quot;Clarkson Cup&quot; as the late Governor General Lord Stanley had done for the NHL years before.

The NWHL league lasted nine years before it disbanded one year after Commissioner Fennell retired 2006 after balancing Mayoral duties and growing a professional sports league. Mayor Fennell signed over all legal instruments for the NWHL to the Ontario Women&#x27;s Hockey Association (OWHA) to lead the next steps. However, one season later, following the 2006–07 season, all existing owners quit and it appeared there would be no league.

In 2007–08, players from the old NWHL joined new teams in similar markets in the newly formed Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League.

== Structure ==
From the 1998–99 to the 2001–02 seasons, the NWHL consisted of two divisions: the Eastern Division with Quebec-based teams, and the Western Division with Ontario-based teams.

For the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, the league had three divisions: the Eastern Division with Quebec-based teams, a renamed Central Division with Ontario-based teams, and a new Western Division with teams in Alberta (both seasons) and British Columbia (2002–03 only). The high travel costs for the two Alberta teams caused them to leave the NWHL to form the Western Women&#x27;s Hockey League, reducing the NWHL to the Eastern and Central Divisions for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons.

The WWHL had five teams, in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Minnesota, for its own 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. The WWHL agreed to merge with the NWHL for the 2006–07 NWHL season. The NWHL reverted to three divisions: Eastern Division with Quebec-based teams, the Central Division with Ontario-based teams, and a renewed Western Division with teams Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Minnesota. The Eastern and Central Division teams scheduled a 35-game unbalanced but interlocking schedule, while the Western Division would only play within itself for the regular season - saving travel costs for all three divisions. The merger broke down midseason, with the WWHL teams treating it as the 2006–07 WWHL season and the remaining NWHL teams handling their playoffs with all four teams from the Central Division and the top two teams from the Eastern Division qualifying for the postseason. In the NWHL playoffs, teams played a best-of-three series to determine the Eastern and Central Division champions, who then met for the NWHL championship. By the end of the 2006–07 NWHL season, the league had fallen into disarray, season records are incomplete, and the league folded shortly after the Central Division&#x27;s Brampton Thunder defeated the Eastern Division&#x27;s Montreal Axion to win the last ever NWHL Championship.

==Championship==
During its inaugural 1998–99 season, a playoff tournament was held over three consecutive days, resulting in the presentation of a gold, silver and bronze medal.

For the next six seasons, the playoff champion was awarded the NWHL Champions Cup.

For its final two seasons, the championship winner was awarded the Clarkson Cup. Though the NWHL and the Western Women&#x27;s Hockey League (WWHL) were considered merged for the 2006–07 season, the WWHL teams did not compete for the Clarkson Cup, instead playing for the WWHL Champions Cup.

After the 2007 disbanding of the NWHL, the Clarkson Cup was presented to the winner of a playoff between WWHL and Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League (CWHL) teams, then solely to the CWHL champion after the WWHL merged with that league.

A list of NWHL Championship winners and the team they met in the final:

<text>Declared monuments of Hong Kong are places, structures or buildings legally declared to receive the highest level of protection. In Hong Kong, declaring a monument requires consulting the Antiquities Advisory Board, the approval of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong as well as the publication of the notice on the &quot;Hong Kong Government Gazette&quot;.

As of December 2024, there are 136 declared monuments in Hong Kong, with 58 listed on Hong Kong Island, 55 on New Territories, 14 on Kowloon, and 9 on the Outlying Islands.

Under Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance, some other buildings are classified as Grades I, II and III historic buildings, and are not listed below.

== Monument declaration and historic buildings grading system ==

There was no direct link between graded buildings and monuments. As of July 2007, 607 buildings had been graded (since 1980), 54 of these, including five Grade I buildings, had been demolished. As of August 2007, of 151 buildings classified as Grade I, only 28 pre-war buildings have been declared monuments since 1980.

On 26 November 2008, the Antiquities Advisory Board announced that the declaration of monuments would be related to the grading of historic buildings.

==Proposed monuments==
The Antiquities Authority (the Secretary for Development) may declare a building facing a demolition risk a proposed monument, thus providing the building with immediate protection against demolition. A Declaration of &quot;proposed&quot; status is valid for twelve months and may be extended. However the affected owner may object to the &quot;proposed&quot; status. Five buildings were declared proposed monuments between 1982 and 2012: Ohel Leah Synagogue (later Grade I in 1990), Morrison Building (subsequently declared in 2004), Jessville (later Grade III), King Yin Lei (subsequently declared in 2008) and Ho Tung Gardens (later demolished in 2013). Hung Lau was declared a proposed monument on 9 March 2017, and subsequently retained its Grade I status.

<doc id="544648" wikidata="Q3206653" url="?curid=544648" title="MetaFilter">
<text>MetaFilter, known as MeFi to its members, is a general-interest community weblog, founded in 1999 and based in the United States, featuring links to content that users have discovered on the web. Since 2003, it has included the popular question-and-answer subsite Ask MetaFilter. The site has eight paid staff members as of December 2021, including the owner. MetaFilter has about 47,691 active members as of May 2024.

==Community==
From its early beginnings as a small community of webloggers who traded links, the weblog now enjoys international popularity. Members are permitted to make one post to the front page per day, which must feature at least one link. Members may then comment on these posts.

Although membership was initially free and unrestricted, growing membership forced frequent extended closures of new-member signup. On November 18, 2004, Haughey reopened signups, but with a US$5 life-time membership fee. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2009, this fee had kept the site &quot;remarkably free of trolls, griefers and other anonymous jerks&quot;, yielding a &quot;public-spirited flavor of a small town or good university&quot;. Although the number of registrations has topped 100,000, a design flaw in the counting process means that it counts users who abandoned the signup process mid-way; the actual number of posters is smaller, at around 38,700 as of October 2008.

MetaFilter has developed a fairly stable community with a variety of in-jokes. Members regularly gather for meetups in cities around the world, and there are numerous websites with strong connections to MetaFilter members and subgroups, including MetaChat and MonkeyFilter, the latter getting its start during the period when MetaFilter memberships were closed. Readers can mark other users&#x27; comments as a favorite, and commenters derive pride from how many times they have been &quot;favorited&quot;.
==History==
MetaFilter was founded by Matthew Haughey in 1999. Haughey wrote the software for the site himself, using Macromedia ColdFusion and Microsoft SQL Server. The earliest Front Page Post (FPP), concerning cats in scanners and the resulting pictures, debuted on July 14, 1999.

MetaFilter was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;50 Best Websites 2009&quot; feature.

At SXSW 2011, Haughey gave a talk in which he noted that MetaFilter had about 125,000 user accounts, of which 12,000 are active.

In November 2012, MetaFilter experienced a huge drop of traffic due to the Google Panda search update; specifically, the Ask MetaFilter page lost 40% of its traffic. This made MetaFilter overnight lose money and led to the letting go of multiple paid moderators.

In July 2017, the ownership of MetaFilter was transferred from Matthew Haughey to long-time moderator Josh Millard.

In June 2018 the site was losing US$8,000 per month but rebounded with new sources of ad revenue and increased member contributions.

In May 2022, the ownership of MetaFilter was transferred to Jessamyn West, who had been MetaFilter&#x27;s first volunteer and first employee. Additionally, a Steering Committee of community members was proposed in March and elected in August.
==Content==
MetaFilter&#x27;s name derives from the idea that weblogs &quot;filter&quot; the &quot;best of the web&quot;, and MetaFilter posts would be the best of the best. Posters are presumed responsible for selecting only the most interesting or novel websites to link, and users&#x27; reputations are largely determined by overall posting quality. Half-baked posts, self-promotion, open-ended questions, and other fare common on other community sites and internet forums are strongly discouraged at MetaFilter. Posts must contain a link, and the site linked must be of high quality.

===Best of the Web===
What gets posted is diverse. Online art, award-winning web design, photography galleries, and the like fit into a &quot;cool site of the day&quot; theme that is highly prized but often generates scant discussion. Flash games and funny online movies also appear. Net and blog culture discussions also percolate through MetaFilter, reflecting its early connections with Blogger, but this is becoming less common as membership expands.

===NewsFilter===
Open posting permits less rigorous items as well. The derisive term for this on MetaFilter is &quot;NewsFilter&quot; (or similar -Filter names for specific news topics, e.g. &quot;IraqFilter&quot;). Nevertheless, it is accepted that some discussion of current events and politics in particular is inevitable, and a certain level is tolerated. If more than one post is made about a news topic, the extras are often deleted and discussion is redirected to the &quot;canonical&quot; post about the topic, usually the first one made. Important news items or political arguments can turn into very long discussions, such as 9/11 (2001), the London Bombings (2005), and Hurricane Katrina (2005)—which generated over 80 front page posts in about a week. The first example of this was arguably the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.

===Investigations===
Because MetaFilter bans &quot;selflinks&quot; or posts by a person with a significant conflict of interest, posts tend to be closely scrutinized. Members of the site also have, several times, worked closely together to root out deception and scams. In May 2001, MetaFilter played a key role in uncovering the Kaycee Nicole hoax, in which a woman made up a fake online persona of a teenage daughter who was dying of cancer, fooling many bloggers and garnering sympathy and gifts. In October 2004, MetaFilter members uncovered the identities of the writers of the hoax Website &quot;Nick Nolte&#x27;s Diary&quot;. An astroturfing campaign by Holden Karnofsky, the co-founder of the online charity GiveWell, was detected in January 2008 through a sockpuppet posting to Ask MetaFilter, leading to Karnofsky&#x27;s resignation. In 2009, a user detected photoshopping by photographer Edgar Martins in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; gallery, which was subsequently withdrawn.

==Moderation==
One of MetaFilter&#x27;s founding tenets and an important factor in the &quot;feel&quot; of the site is the idea that the bulk of moderation is done through social norms and peer pressure, referred to as &quot;self-policing&quot; in a site tagline. Posts that do not meet the community&#x27;s standards for quality are often &quot;called out&quot; to MetaTalk, an administrative area of the site, and interested members discuss how the post could have been improved, or, in some cases, ruthlessly mock the offender. (The community occasionally concludes, after discussion, that the call-out was unwarranted.) Moderators may step in and temporarily suspend an offending user&#x27;s account, but this is rare; permanent bans are rarer still, and are generally reserved for spammers and other egregious abusers of the site. MetaTalk also sees particularly excellent posts called out for praise, and moderators regularly feature superlative contributions on the main page&#x27;s sidebar.

For the site&#x27;s first few years, this practice of self-policing ensured a high level of quality and allowed Haughey to use a light touch in moderating the site; however, as the community has grown, Haughey has expanded the site&#x27;s staff and taken a more active role. In 2004, Jessamyn West began assisting him with moderation duties; in 2007, user Josh Millard (&quot;cortex&quot;) was appointed as an additional moderator. In 2008, London user Ricardo Vacapinta assumed off-hours moderator duties, and in April 2011 Jeremy Preacher (restless_nomad) came on to keep an eye on things over the weekend. A flagging feature allows members to call moderator attention to substandard, offensive, or outstanding posts, allowing users continued input towards shaping the site while quickly alerting site staff to potential trouble spots.

On May 19, 2014, Haughey announced that effective June 1, 2014, moderators West, LobsterMitten and goodnewsfortheinsane would be laid off from their positions due to a sudden and unexpected slump in traffic caused by updates to Google&#x27;s Panda search algorithm, which reduced ad revenue generated by Ask MetaFilter by more than 40%.

==Subsites==
As mentioned under Moderation, the administrative area known as MetaTalk, or MeTa for short, allows for meta-discussion of the community, including bug reports, feature requests, and &quot;self-policing&quot;.

In 2003, Ask MetaFilter was launched. This forum allows members to post questions to the community, without the link requirement. AskMe quickly grew to a strong side community with slightly different etiquette requirements and many daily threads that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Users are limited to asking one question per week and are allowed to ask questions anonymously.

At the end of 2005, MetaFilter Projects was launched. This area of the site is for members to announce web projects they have been working on—the one place on the site where so-called &quot;self-linking&quot; is permitted. Members can vote on projects, and often post interesting projects to the main site following the same guidelines as any other post.

In 2006, MetaFilter Music launched. This area of the site allows users to upload their own musical creations, which others can listen to directly on the website, along with playlist and favorites features.

Later on August 24, 2006, MetaFilter Jobs was added. This section was created for members to post job openings.

In 2007, MetaFilter launched a podcast, which lives at the Podcast subsite. 

in June 2010, the IRL subsite was launched as a place to share community meetups and other events.

In 2014, FanFare was created to give the community a place to discuss entertainment media such as TV shows, Movies, Podcasts, Books, and Special Events.

<doc id="544652" wikidata="Q3142310" url="?curid=544652" title="Hugh Segal">
<text>Hugh Segal (October 13, 1950 – August 9, 2023) was a Canadian political strategist, author, commentator, academic, and senator. He served as chief of staff to Ontario Premier Bill Davis and later to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Segal resigned from the Senate of Canada on June 15, 2014, as a result of his appointment as master (later principal) of Massey College in Toronto.

==Life and career==

===Politics and public policy===
Segal was inspired by a visit from Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1962 to his school, United Talmud Torah Academy in Montreal. Segal went on to graduate from the University of Ottawa and was an aide to federal Progressive Conservative Leader of the Opposition Robert Stanfield in the early 1970s, while still a university student.

At the age of 21, he was an unsuccessful Progressive Conservative candidate in Ottawa Centre for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 general election. He was defeated again in 1974.

As a member of the Big Blue Machine, Segal was a senior aide to Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis in the 1970s and 1980s, and he was named Deputy Minister at age 29. From 1992 to 1993, he was Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

Segal finished second to Joe Clark after the first ballot of the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election, but he chose to withdraw and support Clark (the eventual winner) in the second ballot runoff vote against third-place finisher David Orchard. He had also briefly considered running for the Progressive Conservative leadership in 1993.

====Senate====

In 2005, Segal was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin. He was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee until he &quot;reluctantly&quot; agreed to resign in 2007 at the request of the Conservative government, which reportedly wished to appoint a more ideologically conservative senator to the role after the committee issued a report critical of the Conservative government&#x27;s foreign aid policy. Segal insisted, however, that the move was an administrative one. Segal later served as Chair of the Special Senate Committee on Anti-Terrorism.

In December 2013, Segal announced his intention to resign from the Senate in June 2014, twelve years before he would reach the mandatory retirement age of 75, to accept an academic appointment as Master of Massey College in Toronto.

====Commonwealth====
On July 7, 2010, Segal was appointed to the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group (EPG) by Secretary General Kamalesh Sharma. The group&#x27;s mandate is to set out recommendations on how to strengthen the Commonwealth and fulfill its potential in the 21st century. In December 2011, the federal government appointed him special envoy to the Commonwealth with the task of convincing individual countries to sign on to the EPG&#x27;s 106 recommendations.

====Political views====

Segal espoused a moderate brand of conservatism that has little in common with British Thatcherism or US neoconservatism. He was a Red Tory in the tradition of Benjamin Disraeli, Sir John A. Macdonald, John Diefenbaker and his mentors Robert Stanfield and Bill Davis. This political philosophy stresses the common good and promotes social harmony between classes. It is often associated with One Nation Conservatism. The focus is on order, good government and mutual responsibility. Individual rights and personal freedom are not considered absolute. In his 1997 book &quot;Beyond Greed: A Traditional Conservative Confronts Neo-Conservative Excess&quot;, Segal sought to distinguish what he called &quot;traditional&quot; conservatives from neo-conservatives, notably those in the United States.

In an earlier book, his 1996 memoir &quot;No Surrender&quot; (page 225), Segal wrote: &quot;Progressive Conservatives cannot embrace the nihilistic defeatism that masquerades as a neo-conservative polemic in support of individual freedom and disengagement.&quot; He went on to deplore &quot;American fast-food conservatism.&quot; In a speech to the National Press Club on June 21, 1995, Segal referred to the &quot;selfish and directionless nature of the American revolution -- which was more about self-interest, mercantile opportunity, and who collected what tax than it was about tolerance or freedom.&quot;

Segal opposed on civil liberties grounds the imposition of the War Measures Act by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the October Crisis of 1970. He favoured strengthening Canada&#x27;s military and encouraging investment while maintaining a strong social safety net. His 1998 proposal to reduce Canada&#x27;s Goods and Services Tax from 7% to 6% (and then 5%) was adopted by Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party in 2005. During his leadership campaign, he stated his support for capital punishment.

On June 6, 2012, Segal had a comment published in the &quot;National Post&quot; outlining his views on Basic Income. In December 2012, Segal published an essay in the &quot;Literary Review of Canada&quot; promoting the benefits of a guaranteed annual income.

===Journalism===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Segal became a television pundit and newspaper columnist. In the private sector, Segal has been an executive in the advertising, brewing, and financial services industries.

===Academic work===
Segal lived in Kingston, Ontario, and until 2014 was a faculty member at Queen&#x27;s University&#x27;s School of Policy Studies, and has also taught at the university&#x27;s school of business. He served as president of the Institute for Research on Public Policy, a Montreal think tank, from 1999 to 2006. He sat on the board of directors and was a distinguished fellow at the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute. He was also a member of the Trilateral Commission.

Segal was appointed Master of Massey College in the University of Toronto (effective at the end of June 2014) and retired from the Senate to accept the position. He retired from the Massey College position effective June 30, 2019, five years into his seven-year term, and was succeeded by Nathalie Des Rosiers.

==Personal life and death==
Segal was born in Montreal into what he described as a &quot;very low-end, working-class family in what is now called Le Plateau&quot;. However richer relatives ensured that he and his brothers received a good education. He was Jewish.

He was the brother of corporate executive and former university administrator Brian Segal, and of artist Seymour Segal. He was married to Donna Armstrong Segal, a former Ontario Ministry of Health executive. They had one daughter, Jacqueline.

Segal died on August 9, 2023, in Kingston, Ontario, at the age of 72.

==Honours==
*In 2003, Segal was made a Member of the Order of Canada which was later promoted to the grade of Officer. Segal held an honorary doctorate from the Royal Military College of Canada, University of Ottawa and Queen&#x27;s University.
*In 2004, Segal was named honorary captain in the Royal Canadian Navy in 2004.

<text>David Gainey Clarke (30 August 1908 – 18 April 2004) was an American Broadway and motion picture actor.

== Life and career ==
A native of Chicago and graduate of Butler University, Clarke started his career as a stage actor during the 1930s. He made his first film &quot;Knockout&quot; (1941). The actor remains perhaps best known for his film noir roles as a character actor during the 1940s and 1950s. He also played at the Biltmore Theatre in Los Angeles and was featured on Broadway in the original productions of &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot;, &quot;Inquest&quot;, and &quot;The Visit&quot;. On television, Clarke appeared as Abel Bingley on &quot;The Waltons&quot; and as Tiso Novotny in the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;.

David Clarke lived in Belmont, Ohio for several years until he sold his house and moved to Arlington, Virginia to be with his daughters. He later died in Virginia from pneumonia in 2004, aged 95 years. He was married to Nora Dunfee, with whom he had two daughters.

<text>Sir William David Madel (born 6 August 1938) is a politician in the United Kingdom, who was a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party.

==Parliamentary career==
Madel contested the London seat of Erith and Crayford in a 1965 by-election, and again in the general election the following year, but was beaten on each occasion by Labour&#x27;s James Wellbeloved.

He was a Conservative Party Member of Parliament for South Bedfordshire and later South West Bedfordshire for 31 years from 1970 until he stood down at the 2001 general election.

Madel almost suffered one of the biggest upsets of the 1997 general election, when his majority was cut from the 1992 result of 21,273, to just 132 votes.

<text>Ismail I (; 17 July 1487 – 23 May 1524) was the founder and first shah of Safavid Iran, ruling from 1501 until his death in 1524. His reign is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history, as well as one of the gunpowder empires. The rule of Ismail I is one of the most vital in the history of Iran. Before his accession in 1501, Iran, since its Islamic conquest eight-and-a-half centuries earlier, had not existed as a unified country under native Iranian rule. Although many Iranian dynasties rose to power amidst this whole period, it was only under the Buyids that a vast part of Iran properly returned to Iranian rule (945–1055).

The dynasty founded by Ismail I would rule for over two centuries, being one of the greatest Iranian empires and at its height being amongst the most powerful empires of its time, ruling all of present-day Iran, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, and Iraq, as well as parts of modern-day Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It also reasserted the Iranian identity in large parts of Greater Iran. The legacy of the Safavid Empire was also the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon &quot;checks and balances&quot;, its architectural innovations, and patronage for fine arts.

One of his first actions was the proclamation of the Twelver denomination of Shia Islam as the official religion of his newly-founded Safavid Empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam, which had major consequences for the ensuing history of Iran. He caused sectarian tensions in the Middle East when he destroyed the tombs of the Abbasid caliphs, the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifa an-Nu&#x27;man, and the Sufi Muslim ascetic Abdul Qadir Gilani in 1508.

Ismail I was also a prolific poet who under the pen name Khaṭāʾī (Persian/) contributed greatly to the literary development of the Azerbaijani language. He also contributed to Persian literature, though few of his Persian writings survive.

== Origins ==
Ismail I was born to Martha and Shaykh Haydar on July 17, 1487, in Ardabil. His father, Haydar, was the sheikh of the Safavid &quot;tariqa&quot; (Sufi order) and a direct descendant of its Kurdish founder, Safi-ad-din Ardabili (1252–1334). Ismail was the last in this line of hereditary Grand Masters of the order, prior to his ascent to a ruling dynasty.

His mother Martha, better known as Halima Begum, was the daughter of Uzun Hasan, the ruler of the Turkoman Aq Qoyunlu dynasty, by his Pontic Greek wife Theodora Megale Komnene, better known as Despina Khatun. Despina Khatun was the daughter of Emperor John IV of Trebizond. She had married Uzun Hassan in a deal to protect the Empire of Trebizond from the Ottoman Turks. Ismail was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Alexios IV of Trebizond and King Alexander I of Georgia.

Roger Savory suggests that Ismail&#x27;s family was of Iranian origin, likely from Iranian Kurdistan, and later moved to Azerbaijan where they assimilated into the Turkic Azeri population. Ismail was bilingual in Persian and a Southern Turkic dialect, a precursor (i.e. &quot;proto&quot; version) of modern Azeri Turkic. His ancestry was mixed, from various ethnic groups such as Georgians, Greeks, Kurds and Turkomans; the majority of scholars agree that his empire was an Iranian one.

In 700/1301, Safi al-Din assumed the leadership of the Zahediyeh, a significant Sufi order in Gilan, from his spiritual master and father-in-law Zahed Gilani. The order was later known as the Safavid. One genealogy claimed that Sheikh Safi (the founder of the order and Ismael&#x27;s ancestor) was a lineal descendant of Ali. Ismail also proclaimed himself the &quot;Mahdi&quot; and a reincarnation of Ali.

==Early years==

In 1488, the father of Ismail was killed in a battle at Tabasaran against the forces of the Shirvanshah Farrukh Yassar and his overlord, the Aq Qoyunlu, a Turkic tribal federation which controlled most of Iran. In 1494, the Aq Qoyunlu captured Ardabil, killing Ali Mirza Safavi, the eldest son of Haydar, and forcing the 7-year-old Ismail to go into hiding in Gilan, where under the Kar-Kiya ruler Soltan-Ali Mirza, he received education under the guidance of scholars.

When Ismail reached the age of 12, he came out of hiding and returned to what is now Iranian Azerbaijan along with his followers. Ismail&#x27;s rise to power was made possible by the Turkoman tribes of Anatolia and Azerbaijan, who formed the most important part of the Qizilbash movement.

== Reign ==
===Conquest of Iran and its surroundings===
In the summer of 1500, Ismail rallied about 7,000 Qizilbash troops at Erzincan, including members of the Ustajlu, Rumlu, Takkalu, Dhu&#x27;l-Qadar, Afshar, Qajar, and Varsaq. Qizilbash forces passed over the Kura River in December 1500, and marched towards the Shirvanshah&#x27;s state. They defeated the forces of the Shirvanshah Farrukh Yassar near Cabanı (present-day Shamakhi Rayon, Azerbaijan Republic) or at Gulistan (present-day Gülüstan, Goranboy, Nagorno-Karabakh), and subsequently went on to conquer Baku. Thus, Shirvan and its dependencies (up to southern Dagestan in the north) were now Ismail&#x27;s. The Shirvanshah line nevertheless continued to rule Shirvan under Safavid suzerainty for some more years, until 1538, when, during the reign of Ismail&#x27;s son, Tahmasp I (r. 1524–1576), from then on it came to be ruled by a Safavid governor. After the conquest, Ismail had Alexander I of Kakheti send his son Demetre to Shirvan to negotiate a peace agreement.

The successful conquest had alarmed the ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu, Alvand, who subsequently proceeded north from Tabriz, and crossed the Aras River in order to challenge the Safavid forces, and both sides met at the battle of Sharur in which Ismail&#x27;s army came out victorious despite being outnumbered by four to one. Shortly before his attack on Shirvan, Ismail had made the Georgian kings Constantine II and Alexander I of respectively the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, attack the Ottoman possessions near Tabriz, on the promise that he would cancel the tribute that Constantine was forced to pay to the Aq Qoyunlu once Tabriz was captured. After eventually conquering Tabriz and Nakhchivan, Ismail broke the promise he had made to Constantine II, and made both the kingdoms of Kartli as well as Kakheti his vassals.

In July 1501, following his occupation of Tabriz, Ismail took the title Shah of Iran (&quot;Pādshāh-i Irān&quot;). He appointed his former guardian and mentor Husayn Beg Shamlu as the &quot;vakil&quot; (vicegerent) of the empire and the commander-in-chief (&quot;amir al-umara&quot;) of the Qizilbash army. His army was composed of tribal units, the majority of which were Turkmen from Anatolia and Syria with the remainder Kurds and Čaḡatāy. He also appointed a former Iranian &quot;vizier&quot; of the Aq Qoyunlu, named Amir Zakariya, as his &quot;vizier&quot;. After proclaiming himself Shah, Ismail also proclaimed Twelver Shi&#x27;ism to be the official and compulsory religion of Iran. He enforced this new standard by the sword, dissolving Sunni Brotherhoods and executing anyone who refused to comply to the newly implemented Shi&#x27;ism.

Qāsim Beg Ḥayātī Tabrīzī (fl. 961/1554), a poet and bureaucrat of early Safavid era, states that he had heard from several witnesses that Shah Ismail&#x27;s enthronement took place in Tabriz immediately after the battle of Sharur on 1 Jumada al-Thani 907 / 22 December 1501, making Ḥayātī&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Tārīkh&quot; (1554) the only known narrative source to give the exact date of Shah Ismail&#x27;s ascent to the throne.
After defeating an Aq Qoyunlu army in 1502, Ismail took the title of &quot;Shah of Iran&quot;. In the same year he gained possession of Erzincan and Erzurum, while a year later, in 1503, he conquered Eraq-e Ajam and Fars. &quot;See also: Battle of Hamadan (1503)&quot; One year later he conquered Mazandaran, Gorgan, and Yazd.

In 1507, he conquered Diyarbakır. During the same year, Ismail appointed the Iranian Amir Najm al-Din Mas&#x27;ud Gilani as the new &quot;vakil&quot;. This was because Ismail had begun favoring the Iranians more than the Qizilbash, who, although they had played a crucial role in Ismail&#x27;s campaigns, possessed too much power and were no longer considered trustworthy. One year later, Ismail forced the rulers of Khuzestan, Lorestan, and Kurdistan to become his vassals. The same year, Ismail and Husayn Beg Shamlu seized Baghdad, putting an end to the Aq Qoyunlu. Ismail then began destroying Sunni sites in Baghdad, including tombs of Abbasid Caliphs and tombs of Imam Abū Ḥanīfah and Abdul Qadir Gilani.

By 1510, he had conquered the whole of Iran (including Shirvan), southern Dagestan (with its important city of Derbent), Mesopotamia, Armenia, Khorasan, and Eastern Anatolia, and had made the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti his vassals. In the same year, Husayn Beg Shamlu lost his office as commander-in-chief in favor of a man of humble origins, Mohammad Beg Ustajlu. Ismail also appointed Najm-e Sani as the new &quot;vakil&quot; of the empire due to the death of Mas&#x27;ud Gilani.

Ismail I moved against the Uzbeks. In the battle near the city of Merv, some 17,000 Qizilbash warriors trapped an Uzbek force. The Uzbek ruler, Muhammad Shaybani, was caught and killed trying to escape the battle, and the shah had his skull made into a jewelled drinking goblet. In 1512, Najm-e Sani was killed during a clash with the Uzbeks, which made Ismail appoint Abd al-Baqi Yazdi as the new &quot;vakil&quot; of the empire.

===War against the Ottomans===

The active recruitment of support for the Safavid cause among the Turcoman tribes of Eastern Anatolia, among tribesmen who were Ottoman subjects, had inevitably placed the neighbouring Ottoman empire and the Safavid state on a collision course. As the &quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot; states, &quot;As orthodox or Sunni Muslims, the Ottomans had reason to view with alarm the progress of Shīʿī ideas in the territories under their control, but there was also a grave political danger that the Ṣafawīya, if allowed to extend its influence still further, might bring about the transfer of large areas in Asia Minor from Ottoman to Persian allegiance&quot;. By the early 1510s, Ismail&#x27;s rapidly expansionist policies had made the Safavid border in Asia Minor shift even further west. In 1511, there was a widespread pro-Safavid rebellion in southern Anatolia by the Takkalu Qizilbash tribe, known as the Şahkulu Rebellion, and an Ottoman army that was sent in order to put down the rebellion down was defeated. A large-scale incursion into Eastern Anatolia by Safavid ghazis under Nūr-ʿAlī Ḵalīfa coincided with the accession of Sultan Selim I in 1512 to the Ottoman throne, and became the casus belli which led to Selim&#x27;s decision to invade Safavid Iran two years later. Selim and Ismail had been exchanging a series of belligerent letters prior to the attack. While the Safavid forces were at Chaldiran and planning on how to confront the Ottomans, Mohammad Khan Ustajlu, who served as the governor of Diyarbakır, and Nur-Ali Khalifa, a commander who knew how the Ottomans fought, proposed that they should attack as quickly as possible. This proposal was rejected by the powerful Qizilbash officer Durmish Khan Shamlu, who rudely said that Mohammad Khan Ustajlu was only interested in the province which he governed. The proposal was rejected by Ismail himself, who said; &quot;I am not a caravan-thief; whatever is decreed by God, will occur.&quot;
Selim I eventually defeated Ismail at the battle of Chaldiran in 1514. Ismail&#x27;s army was more mobile and his soldiers were better prepared, but the Ottomans prevailed due in large part to their efficient modern army, and possession of artillery, black powder and muskets. Ismail was wounded and almost captured in battle. Selim entered the Iranian capital of Tabriz in triumph on September 5, but did not linger. A mutiny among his troops, fearing a counterattack and entrapment by fresh Safavid forces called in from the interior, forced the triumphant Ottomans to withdraw prematurely. This allowed Ismail to recover. Among the booty from Tabriz was Ismail&#x27;s favorite wife, for whose release the Sultan demanded huge concessions, which were refused. Despite his defeat at the Battle of Chaldiran, Ismail quickly recovered most of his kingdom, from east of the Lake Van to the Persian Gulf. However, the Ottomans managed to annex for the first time Eastern Anatolia and parts of Mesopotamia, as well as briefly northwestern Iran.

The Venetian ambassador Caterino Zeno describes the events as follows:

He also adds that:

==Late reign and death==

Shah Ismail&#x27;s death ensued after a few years of a very saddening and depressing period of his life. After the Battle of Chaldiran, Ismail lost his supernatural air and the aura of invincibility, gradually falling into heavy drinking. He retired to his palace and never again participated in a military campaign, and left the affairs of the state to his &quot;vizier&quot; Mirza Shah Husayn, who became his close friend and Nadeem (i.e. drinking companion). This allowed Mirza Shah Husayn to gain influence and expand his authority. Mirza Shah Husayn was assassinated in 1523 by a group of Qizilbash officers, after which Ismail appointed Zakariya&#x27;s son Jalal al-Din Mohammad Tabrizi as his new &quot;vizier&quot;. Ismail died on 23 May 1524 aged 36 and was buried in Ardabil. He was succeeded by his son Tahmasp I.

The consequences of the defeat at Chaldiran were also psychological for Ismail; his relationships with the Qizilbash followers were fundamentally altered. The tribal rivalries between the Qizilbash which had ceased temporarily before the defeat at Chaldiran resurfaced intensely immediately after his death and led to ten years of civil war (930–40/1524–33) until Shah Tahmasp regained control of the affairs of the state. The Safavids later briefly lost Balkh and Kandahar to the Mughals, and nearly lost Herat to the Uzbeks.

During Ismail&#x27;s reign, mainly in the late 1510s, the first steps for the Habsburg–Persian alliance were taken with Charles V and Ludwig II of Hungary being in contact with a view of combining against the common Ottoman Turkish enemy.

== Royal ideology ==

From an early age, Ismail was acquainted with the Iranian cultural legacy. When he reached Lahijan in 1494, he gifted Mirza Ali Karkiya a copy of the medieval Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (Book of Kings) with over 300 illustrations. Owing to his fondness of Iranian national legends, Ismail named three of his four sons after mythological shahs and heroes of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;; his oldest son was named Tahmasp, after the last shah of the Pishdadian dynasty; his third son Sam after the champion of the Pishdadian shah Manuchehr and ancestor of the celebrated warrior-hero Rostam; his youngest son Bahram after the Sasanian shah Bahram V (), famous for his romantic life and hunting feats. Ismail&#x27;s expertise in Persian poetic tales such as the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, helped him to represent himself as the heir to the Iranian model of kingship. According to the modern historian Abbas Amanat, Ismail was motivated to visualize himself as a shah of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, possibly Kaykhosrow, the archetype of a great Iranian king, and the person who overcame the Turanian king Afrasiyab, the nemesis of Iran. From an Iranian perspective, Afrasiyab&#x27;s kingdom of Turan was commonly identified with the land of the Turks, in particular with the Uzbek Khanate of Bukhara in Central Asia. After Ismail defeated the Uzbeks, his victory was portrayed in Safavid records as a victory over the mythological Turanians. However, this fondness of Iranian legends was not only restricted to that of Ismail and Safavid Iran; Both Muhammad Shaybani, Selim I, and later Babur and his Mughal progeny, all associated themselves with these legends. Regardless of its increasing differences, Western, Central, and South Asia all followed a common Persianate model of culture and kingship.

Before his defeat at Chaldiran in 1514, Ismail not only identified himself as the reincarnation of Alid figures such as Ali and Husayn, but also as the personification of the divine light of investiture (&quot;farr&quot;) that had radiated in the ancient Iranian shahs Darius, Khosrow I Anushirvan (), Shapur I (), since the era of the Achaemenids and Sasanians. This was a typical Safavid combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic Iranian motifs. The Safavids also included and promoted Turkic and Mongol aspects from the Central Asian steppe, such as giving high-ranking positions to Turkic leaders, and utilizing Turkic tribal clans for their aspirations in war. They likewise included Turco-Mongolian titles such as khan and bahadur to their growing collection of titles. The cultural aspects of the Safavids soon became even more numerous, as Ismail and his successors included and promoted Kurds, Arabs, Georgians, Circassians, and Armenians into their imperial program. Moreover, the conquests of Genghis Khan and Timur had merged Mongolian and Chagatai aspects into the Persian bureaucratic culture, terminology, seals, and symbols.

== Ismail&#x27;s poetry ==

Ismail is also known for his poetry using the pen name &quot;Khaṭāʾī&quot; (Persian/). He wrote in the Turkish of Safavid Iran and Persian, although his extant verses in the former vastly outnumber the latter. The (Turkoman) Turkish spoken in Iran, which was commonly known as &quot;Turki&quot;, was not the Turkish of Istanbul, but a sort of precursor (i.e &quot;proto&quot; form ) of modern-day Azerbaijani or Azeri Turkic (see also; Ajem-Turkic).

Vladimir Minorsky characterized Ismail&#x27;s &quot;divan&quot; as written in a &quot;Southern Turkish (Turcoman) dialect directly associated with the so-called ʻʻĀzarbāyjān Turkishʼʼ, and noted that his Turkish &quot;already shows traces of decomposition due to the influence of the Iranian milieu&quot;. Minorsky also added that Chaghatai words are found (as well as other words and forms of unknown origin) in Ismail I&#x27;s poems. Stephen Dale describes the language used by Ismail in his well-known propagandistic verse directed at the Turkoman tribesmen in Azerbaijan and eastern Anatolia as the same precursor of Azeri Turkish (i.e. proto-Azeri) that he was able to converse in.

Ismail is considered an important figure in the literary history of Azerbaijani language. According to Encyclopædia Iranica, &quot;Ismail was a skillful poet who used prevalent themes and images in lyric and didactic-religious poetry with ease and some degree of originality&quot;. He was also deeply influenced by the Persian literary tradition of Iran, particularly by the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Ferdowsi, which probably explains the fact that he named all of his sons after &quot;Shahnameh&quot;-characters. Dickson and Welch suggest that Ismail&#x27;s &quot;Shāhnāmaye Shāhī&quot; was intended as a present to his young son Tahmasp. After defeating Muhammad Shaybani&#x27;s Uzbeks, Ismail asked Hatefi, a famous poet from Jam (Khorasan), to write a Shahnameh-like epic about his victories and his newly established dynasty. Although the epic was left unfinished, it was an example of &quot;mathnawis&quot; in the heroic style of the Shahnameh written later on for the Safavid kings.

Most of the poems are concerned with love—particularly of the mystical Sufi kind—though there are also poems propagating Shi&#x27;i doctrine and Safavi politics. His other serious works include the &quot;Nasihatnāme&quot;, a book of advice, and the unfinished &quot;Dahnāme&quot;, a book which extols the virtues of love—both written in the same Turkoman Turkish (i.e. proto-Azeri Turkic).

Along with the poet Imadaddin Nasimi, Khatā&#x27;ī is considered to be among the first proponents of using a simpler Azerbaijani language in verse that would appeal to a broader audience. His work is most popular in Azerbaijan, as well as among the Bektashis of Turkey. There is a large body of Alevi and Bektashi poetry that has been attributed to him. The major impact of his religious writings, in the long run, was the conversion of Persia from Sunni to Shia Islam.
Examples of his poems are:

=== Poetry example 2 ===
=== Poetry example 3 ===
=== Poetry from other composers about Ismail, I. ===

==Emergence of a clerical aristocracy==
An important feature of the Safavid society was the alliance that emerged between the ulama (the religious class) and the merchant community. The latter included merchants trading in the bazaars, the trade and artisan guilds (&quot;asnaf&quot;) and members of the quasi-religious organizations run by dervishes (&quot;futuvva&quot;). Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia, many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so-called &quot;vaqf&quot;. They would thus retain the official ownership and secure their land from being confiscated by royal commissioners or local governors, as long as a percentage of the revenues from the land went to the ulama. Increasingly, members of the religious class, particularly the mujtahids and the seyyeds, gained full ownership of these lands, and, according to contemporary historian Iskandar Munshi, Persia started to witness the emergence of a new and significant group of landowners.

==Appearance and skills==

Ismail was described by contemporaries as having a regal appearance, gentlemanly in quality and youthfulness. He also had a fair complexion and red hair.

An Italian traveller describes Ismail as follows:

== Legacy ==
Ismail&#x27;s greatest legacy was establishing an empire which lasted over 200 years. As Alexander Mikaberidze states, &quot;The Safavid dynasty would rule for two more centuries [after Ismail&#x27;s death] and establish the basis for the modern-nation state of Iran.&quot; Even after the fall of the Safavids in 1736, their cultural and political influence endured through the succeeding dynasties of the Afsharid, Zand, Qajar, and Pahlavi states and into the contemporary Islamic Republic of Iran as well as the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan, where Shia Islam is still the dominant religion as it was during the Safavid era.

== In popular culture ==

=== Literature ===
In the Safavid period, the famous Azeri folk romance &quot;Shah Ismail&quot; emerged. According to Azerbaijani literary critic Hamid Arasly, this story is related to Ismail I. But it is also possible that it is dedicated to Ismail II.

<doc id="544672" wikidata="Q1591315" url="?curid=544672" title="Slew rate">
<text>In electronics and electromagnetics, slew rate is defined as the change of voltage or current, or any other electrical or electromagnetic quantity, per unit of time. Expressed in SI units, the unit of measurement is given as the change per second, but in the context of electronic circuits a slew rate is usually expressed in terms of microseconds (μs) or nanoseconds (ns).

Electronic circuits may specify minimum or maximum limits on the slew rates for their inputs or outputs, with these limits only valid under some set of given conditions (e.g. output loading). When given for the output of a circuit, such as an amplifier, the slew rate specification guarantees that the speed of the output signal transition will be at least the given minimum, or at most the given maximum. When applied to the input of a circuit, it instead indicates that the external driving circuitry needs to meet those limits in order to guarantee the correct operation of the receiving device. If these limits are violated, some error might occur and correct operation is no longer guaranteed.

For example, when the input to a digital circuit is driven too slowly, the digital input value registered by the circuit may oscillate between 0 and 1 during the signal transition. In other cases, a &quot;maximum&quot; slew rate is specified in order to limit the high frequency content present in the signal, thereby preventing such undesirable effects as ringing or radiated interference.

In amplifiers, limitations in slew rate capability can give rise to non-linear effects. For a sinusoidal waveform not to be subject to slew rate limitation, the slew rate capability (in volts per second) at all points in an amplifier must satisfy the following condition:
:formula_1

where &quot;f&quot; is the operating frequency, and formula_2 is the peak amplitude of the waveform, i.e. half the peak-to-peak swing of a sinusoid.

In mechanics the slew rate is the change in position over time of an object which orbits around the observer, measured in radians, degrees or turns per unit of time. It has dimension formula_3

where formula_4 is the output current of the first stage in saturation.

Slew rate helps us identify the maximum input frequency and amplitude applicable to the amplifier such that the output is not significantly distorted. Thus it becomes imperative to check the datasheet for the device&#x27;s slew rate before using it for high-frequency applications.

Slew rate can be deliberately limited using two op amps, a capacitor, and two resistors.

==Musical applications==

In electronic musical instruments, slew circuitry or software-generated slew functions are used deliberately to provide a portamento (also called &quot;glide&quot; or &quot;lag&quot;) feature, where an initial digital value or analog control voltage is slowly transitioned to a new value over a period of time (see interpolation).

<text>Patrick Charles Martyn Nicholls (born 14 November 1948) is a British solicitor and politician who served as a Conservative MP for Teignbridge between 1983 and 2001.

A solicitor by profession and formerly an East Devon District Councillor, Nicholls was first elected to the House of Commons in 1983 at the age of 34, winning a comfortable majority over the nationally known Liberal Party candidate, John Alderson, who had resigned as Chief Constable of Devon &amp; Cornwall specifically to contest the seat.

Within a year of entering the House of Commons, Nicholls was made a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Office Minister David Mellor, and subsequently to the Minister of Agriculture John Selwyn Gummer. He was also made a Steward of The British Boxing Board of Control.

After the 1987 General Election, Nicholls entered the government as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment. Still not yet 40, he was given a key role in piloting the second tranche of Conservative Trades Union reforms through Standing Committee. His upward advance was checked, however, when he was arrested for drink driving in 1990, as a result of which he resigned from the government.

Nicholls’ career was, however, only temporarily stalled. He was appointed to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy at its inception in 1992 and served on The North Atlantic Assembly and the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs. In 1994, he was made a Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party and in 1997 was appointed the Shadow Fisheries Minister by the then Leader of the Opposition, William Hague. A leading Eurosceptic, Nicholls was credited with having single-handedly turned Conservative Party policy around in favour of leaving the EU Common Fisheries Policy.

After losing his seat in 2001, Nicholls became Chairman of The Young Britons Foundation, a research think-tank established in July 2003 to &quot;help train tomorrow&#x27;s centre-right leaders and activists today&quot;. Currently, Nicholls is a freelance political journalist and lectures on British and American politics in Europe and America as well as the UK.

Nicholls is married with three children. His wife, Bridget, is also a solicitor.

<text>John Patrick Nowlan (10 November 1931 – 25 April 2020) was a Canadian politician from Nova Scotia. Nowlan served as a Progressive Conservative backbench Member of Parliament for the riding of Annapolis Valley—Hants from 1965 to 1993.

==Early life==
Born in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Nowlan was the son of Diefenbaker-era Minister of Finance George Nowlan. Nowlan attended Acadia University in his hometown, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1952. He then attended Dalhousie Law School, graduating in 1955.

==Political career==
Nowlan was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1965 serving the riding of Annapolis Valley.

In 1966, when the Conservatives opposed the Liberal government&#x27;s legislation to end a national railway strike, Nowlan broke with the party to vote in favour of the legislation.

Nowlan was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention, running as a right-wing candidate.

In November 1990, Nowlan resigned from the Tory caucus, citing his opposition to the Mulroney government&#x27;s failed Meech Lake Accord and several other issues. Nowlan sat as an &quot;Independent Progressive Conservative&quot; until the 1993 federal election.

Nowlan ran as an independent in the 1993 election, finishing in third place behind the Liberal and Progressive Conservative candidates and receiving 19.40% of the vote.

==Death==
Nowlan died on 25 April 2020, aged 88.

==Personal life==
Pat was married to Cynthia Nowlan, an entrepreneur who started a store in Ottawa called &quot;The Pepper Pot&quot;. The couple had four children and six grandchildren.

<text>Bruce Joseph Grocott, Baron Grocott (born 1 November 1940) is a British politician who has been a Member of the House of Lords since 2001. A member of the Labour Party, he served as a Member of Parliament for four terms between 1974 and 2001, representing constituencies in Staffordshire and Shropshire.

==Early life==
Grocott was born in Kings Langley near Watford, Hertfordshire. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Politics from the University of Leicester in 1962. Grocott later obtained a Master of Arts from the University of Manchester for research into Local Government.

He was appointed to the post of lecturer, and later a senior lecturer, at the City of Birmingham College of Commerce (later Birmingham Polytechnic, now Birmingham City University). During this time he was elected to Bromsgrove Urban District Council. From 1972 to 1974 he was a principal lecturer at North Staffordshire Polytechnic.

==House of Commons==
His first attempt to become a member of Parliament was in the 1970 election when he stood unsuccessfully for South West Hertfordshire. He was then selected as a candidate and elected as Member of Parliament for Lichfield and Tamworth in October 1974, in which position he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Planning, and later the Minister of Agriculture.

He lost his seat at the 1979 general election and joined Central Television as a presenter and producer, working on programmes such as &quot;Left, Right and Centre&quot;, &quot;Central Lobby&quot; and &quot;Central Weekend&quot;.

He was re-elected for The Wrekin in 1987 and he was very shortly thereafter appointed Deputy Shadow Leader of the House to Jack Cunningham before becoming advisor to the Leader of the Opposition, Neil Kinnock and, later, a Foreign Affairs Spokesman under John Smith. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Tony Blair, first as Leader of the Opposition and then Prime Minister, from 1994 until 2001.

He transferred to Telford in 1997 when The Wrekin was divided. He served this seat until the 2001 general election, when he stepped down from the Commons.

==House of Lords==
He was made a life peer under the title of Baron Grocott, of Telford, in the County of Shropshire, on 2 July 2001, quickly being promoted to a government whip in the House of Lords.

From 2002 to 2008 he was the Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords as well as Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, the honorary post usually held by the Chief Whip. As the Chief Whip, he was sworn of the Privy Council in 2002. He has promoted further reform of the Lords, including attempts to abolish by-elections for hereditary peers.

In October 2012 it was announced that Lord Grocott had been elected as the next chancellor of the University of Leicester, the first time in the university&#x27;s history that a former student had been appointed to the post. He was installed as chancellor at the degree ceremony in DeMontfort Hall on 24 January 2013. His term finished in July 2018 and he was replaced by Lord Willetts.

==Personal life==
Grocott is married with two sons and lives in Staffordshire.

<text>Steven Alan Hassan (pronounced ; born 1954) is an American mental health professional and author who specializes in the area of cults. He worked as a deprogrammer in the late 1970s, but since then has advocated a non-coercive form of exit counseling.

Hassan has written several books on the subject of mind control and is often described in the media as an expert on mind control and cults. Hassan&#x27;s view of undue influence in such groups is echoed by some scholars with backgrounds in psychology and psychiatry. Some researchers in the sociology of religion are critical of his application of mind-control theory to what they characterise as new religious movements.

Hassan is a former member of the Unification Church, and founded Ex-Moon Inc. in 1979. In 1999 he founded the Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

==Early life and Unification Church membership==
Hassan was raised in a Jewish family in Queens, New York. At age 19, while pursuing a poetry degree at Queens College, Hassan was recruited into the Unification Church, and spent 27 months as a member. 

Hassan was involved in recruiting, fundraising, and political campaigning for the Unification Church of the United States. He was &quot;a former Unification Church high official&quot; and &quot;a national leader of &quot;. He described living in communal housing and sleeping less than four hours a night. He said that he believed Richard Nixon was an archangel and that, during the Watergate scandal, he and other members of the church engaged in prayer and fasting to &quot;prove their loyalty to the president&quot;. He surrendered his bank account to the Unification Church, and quit college and his job to work for the organization. Hassan said that &quot;he was ready to kill or die for&quot; Sun Myung Moon. His membership in the church concerned and confused his family.

In 1976, after working for two full days without sleep, Hassan fell asleep while driving, resulting in a serious automobile accident that required medical care. Hassan&#x27;s parents hired &quot;deprogrammers&quot; who seized him from his sister&#x27;s home and took him to an apartment. After five days of isolation and intensive deprogramming, Hassan became convinced that he had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the church. Feeling shame at his gullibility and guilt for his recruitment of others, he decided to &quot;dedicate his life to studying cults and developing strategies to help their members escape.&quot; Hassan returned to his Jewish faith after leaving the Unification Church.

==Career==
===Institutions===
In 1979, Hassan founded a non-profit organization called Ex-Moon Inc. The organization consisted of over four hundred former members of the Unification Church. The organization is now defunct. In 1999, he founded the Freedom of Mind Resource Center. The center is registered as a domestic corporation in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and Hassan is its president and treasurer. Hassan posts dossiers on the site about organizations he has investigated or received complaints about.

=== Deprogramming and exit counseling ===
Hassan took part in a number of &quot;deprogrammings&quot; in the late 1970s, but has been critical of them since 1980 and has instead advocated exit counseling. According to Hassan, he has not kidnapped anyone, nor tortured, deprived anyone of food or sleep or been disrespectful towards the clients. An affidavit from one subject, and Hassan&#x27;s own written description of the same deprogramming, indicate that the subject, who was a football player, was restrained by his former teammates. According to sociologists Anson D. Shupe and Darnell, Hassan represents &quot;a maturation of the anti-cult movement toward professionalisation and away from coercive vigilantism&quot;. 

Hassan&#x27;s preferred approach, exit counseling, is also a form of family-initiated intervention, but distinguishes itself by allowing the subject to leave at any time and by adopting a non-violent, persuasive approach. In &quot;Combatting Cult Mind Control&quot; (1988), Hassan writes that although &quot;the non-coercive approach will not work in every case, it has proved to be the option most families prefer. Forcible intervention can be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail.&quot;

Michael Langone, a psychologist and advocate for exit counseling, questions Hassan&#x27;s humanistic counseling approach in a 1995 work. According to Langone, Hassan&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Intervention Therapy&quot; operates on the assumption that, deep down, all members of &quot;mind control groups&quot; want to get out of the group. In the context of family intervention, the &quot;counselor knows best what the cultist really wants&quot; approach contains the risk of the counselor &quot;manipulating the cultist from point A (&quot;I&#x27;ll talk to you because my family requested it&quot;) to point B (&quot;I want to leave the cult&quot;) while mistakenly believing that he is helping the cultist &quot;grow&quot;.&quot; For Langone, the fact that the counselor&#x27;s assistance has in no way been sought by the subject casts further doubt on the ethical propriety of such manipulation.

Although exit counseling models like Hassan&#x27;s emphasise the voluntary nature of the procedure, Shupe questioned in 2011 how willing the NRM member can be when: (i) they are not actually the client of the counselor (who has been hired by others), and (ii) they are not aware that the counselor&#x27;s primary, preconceived purpose is to convince them to abandon their faith.

===Education and writing===
In 1985, Hassan completed a Master&#x27;s degree in counseling psychology at Cambridge College. Hassan studied hypnosis and is a member of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis and the International Society of Hypnosis. In &quot;Combatting Cult Mind Control&quot; he describes his own recruitment as the result of the unethical use of powerful psychological influence techniques by members of the church.

Hassan spent several years developing and promoting a model to evaluate cults and cult-like groups. In his third book, &quot;Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults, and Beliefs&quot; (2012), Hassan presents Lifton&#x27;s and Margaret Singer&#x27;s models of evaluation alongside his own model represented by the acronym &quot;BITE&quot;: control of Behavior, Information, Thought and Emotion.

Hassan&#x27;s view of the dangers of charismatic leadership is echoed by some scholars with backgrounds in psychology and psychiatry, such as Robert Jay Lifton and Anthony Storr, who raise serious questions about the potential for harm in groups controlled by leaders with pathological personality traits. While acknowledging the validity of the concern, Religious Studies Professor Eugene V. Gallagher is critical of the lack of specificity as to when such questions might appropriately be raised. He argues that theorists like Hassan take well-founded suspicion of some manipulative religious leaders and generalize it into a mind control ideology applicable to all cult leaders and cult members. According to Gallagher, such generalization cultivates mistrust of all non-conventional religious leaders and groups, and disregards the great variety of leadership forms found in new religions.

Sociologists Anson D. Shupe and David G. Bromley, who disagree with Hassan and the anti-cult movement, have criticized his work. Shupe writes that he was creating &quot;a moral crusade&quot; as that was how he made a living. Bromley and Shupe had earlier included a piece by Hassan in a volume they edited (which was otherwise mostly critical of the anti-cult movement) to explain his view, as they considered him one of the best working in the anti-cult field.

Hassan has also applied his cult research to politics. In 2019, he published &quot;The Cult of Trump&quot;: &quot;A Leading Cult Expert Explains How the President Uses Mind Control&quot;. The book represents a broadening of his focus from new religious movements into political culture. The author compares Donald Trump&#x27;s behaviour to that of Jim Jones, L. Ron Hubbard, and Sun Myung Moon, and expresses the hope that the book will lessen political division. Its loose usage of the word &quot;cult&quot; led to initial dismissal and criticism, but following January 6 United States Capitol attack interest in Hassan&#x27;s work in this field increased.

Hassan received his doctorate from Fielding Graduate University and published a dissertation in January 2021. His dissertation was titled &quot;The BITE Model of Authoritarian Control: Undue Influence, Thought Reform, Brainwashing, Mind Control, Trafficking and the Law&quot;. Hassan describes his model as an effort to measure degrees of exploitative control or undue influence and as an attempt to evaluate behavior, information, thought and emotional controls. Hassan contributed two chapters relating to hypnosis and society to the 2024 edited volume &quot;The Routledge International Handbook of Clinical Hypnosis&quot;.

=== In the media ===
Hassan is often described in the media as a cult and mind control expert. After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, he was interviewed by reporters to explain his view of the bombers&#x27; state of mind and how he believed mind control was involved.

Hassan&#x27;s definition of &quot;cult-like behavior&quot; was described by the magazine &quot;Slate&quot; as &quot;particularly wide ranging&quot;; on a blog posting he once compared the British royal family&#x27;s treatment of Meghan Markle to a cult, saying that &quot;any organization willing to maintain its public image by sacrificing the well-being of its members relies on many of the same psychological theories and tactics used by authoritarian cults.&quot; He also described the fitness company SoulCycle as having cult-like aspects. A friend of Hassan stated that he &quot;has a tendency in some ways to see everything as undue influence because he&#x27;s primed to see it that way&quot;, due to his experiences with the Unification Church.

<text>Gottfried Helnwein (born 8 October 1948) is an Austrian-Irish visual artist. He has worked as a painter, draftsman, photographer, muralist, sculptor, installation and performance artist, using a wide variety of techniques and media.

His work is concerned primarily with psychological and sociological anxiety, historical issues and political topics. His subject matter is the human condition. The metaphor for his art is dominated by the image of the child, particularly the wounded child, scarred physically and emotionally from within. His works often reference taboo and controversial issues from recent history, especially the Nazi rule and the Holocaust. As a result, his work is often considered provocative and controversial.

Helnwein has produced artworks for rock bands the Rolling Stones, Scorpions and Rammstein. He has also partnered with Marilyn Manson in the production of &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; and other projects.

Helnwein studied at the University of Visual Art in Vienna. He lives and works in Ireland, where he owns the Castle Gurteen de la Poer, and Los Angeles. 

==Life==
Helnwein was born in Vienna shortly after World War II. His father Joseph Helnwein worked for the Austrian Post and Telegraphy administration (Österreichische Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung), and his mother Margarethe was a housewife.

He has four children with his wife Renate: Cyril, Mercedes, Ali Elvis and Wolfgang Amadeus, all of whom are artists. He also has three grandchildren. In 2004, Helnwein received Irish citizenship.

=== Career and education ===
Helnwein had a strict Roman Catholic upbringing. As a student he organized plays and art exhibitions at the Catholic Marian Society of the Jesuit University Church in Vienna. In 1965, he enrolled at the Higher Federal Institution for Graphic Education and Experimentation. In the following years, he started his first performances for small audiences where he cut his face and hands with razor blades and bandaged himself.

From 1969 to 1973, he studied at the University of Visual Art in Vienna. He was awarded a &quot;Master-class prize&quot; () of the University of Visual Art, Vienna, the Kardinal-König prize and the Theodor-Körner prize. 

Helnwein was offered a chair by the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in 1982. When his demand to admit also children to study at the university was rejected, he declined. In 1983, Helnwein met Andy Warhol in his Factory in New York City, who posed for a series of photo-sessions. In 1985, Rudolf Hausner recommended Helnwein as his successor as professor of the master-class for painting at the University of Visual Art in Vienna, but Helnwein left Vienna and moved to Germany.

Helnwein bought a medieval castle close to Cologne and the Rhine-river. Four years later, in 1989, he established a studio in Tribeca, New York, and thenceforth spent his time between the United States and Germany.

Helnwein moved to Dublin, Ireland, in 1997 and one year later he bought the Castle Gurteen de la Poer in County Waterford. In 2002, he established a studio in downtown Los Angeles and he lives and works since then in Ireland and Los Angeles.

On 3 December 2005, his friend Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at Helnwein&#x27;s castle. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director Alejandro Jodorowsky Gottfried Helnwein was best man
In 2013, the Albertina Museum in Vienna organized a retrospective of Helnwein&#x27;s work. The show was seen by 250,000 visitors and was the most successful exhibition of a contemporary artist in the history of the Albertina.

==Notable works==
Helnwein is part of a tradition going back to the 18th century, to which Messerschmidt&#x27;s grimacing sculptures belong. One sees, too, the common ground of his works with those of Arnulf Rainer and Hermann Nitsch, two other Viennese, who display their own bodies in the frame of reference of injury, pain, and death. And one sees how this fascination with body language goes back to the expressive gesture in the work of Egon Schiele.

===The Child===
Helnwein&#x27;s early work consists mainly of hyperrealistic watercolors, depicting wounded children, as well as photographs and performances – often with children – in public spaces. The bandaged child became the most important figure next to the artist himself allied with him in his actions: the embodiment of the innocent, defenceless individual at the mercy of brute force.

Art historian Peter Gorsen specified the relation between Helnwein&#x27;s work and Viennese Actionism.

In 2004, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco organized the first one-person exhibition of Gottfried Helnwein at an American Museum: &quot;The Child, works by Gottfried Helnwein&quot; at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor.

The show was seen by almost 130,000 visitors and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; quoted it the most important exhibition of a contemporary artist in 2004. Steven Winn, &quot;Chronicle&quot; Arts and Culture critic, wrote: &quot;Helnwein&#x27;s large format, photo-realist images of children of various demeanors boldly probed the subconscious. Innocence, sexuality, victimization and haunting self-possession surge and flicker in Helnwein&#x27;s unnerving work&quot;.

===Self portraits===

At the same time when Helnwein painted watercolors of injured and abused children, from 1969, around 1970/71 he also began a series of self-portrayals in photographs and performances (actions) in his studio and in the streets of Vienna. Actionistic self-portrayals in the manner of a happening featuring his injured and bandaged body and surgical instruments deforming his face go back to Helnwein&#x27;s student days. Since then, bandages have become part of the aesthetic &quot;uniform&quot; of his self-portraits.

The artist exposed himself as victim and martyr: bandages around his head and forks and surgical instruments piercing his mouth or cheek. Frequently the distortions of these tormented images make it difficult to recognize Helnwein&#x27;s face. He appears as a screaming man, mirroring the frightening aspects of life: a twentieth-century Man of Sorrows. His frozen cry, showing the artist in a state of implacable trauma, recalls Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; and Francis Bacon&#x27;s screaming popes. Some of Helnwein&#x27;s grimacing faces also recall the grotesque physiognomic distortions by the eighteenth-century Viennese sculptor Franz Xavier Messerschmidt. They could also be seen as part of the Austrian pictorial tradition that resurfaced in the perturbed and distorted expressionist faces painted by Kokoschka and Egon Schiele before World War I, reappearing in the exaggerated mimicry in Arnulf Rainer&#x27;s &quot;Face Farces&quot;.
William S. Burroughs commented on Helnwein&#x27;s self-portraits in an essay in 1992:
There is a basic misconception that any given face, at any given time, looks more or less the same, like a statue&#x27;s face. Actually, the human face is as variable from moment to moment as a screen on which images are reflected, from within and from without. Gottfried Helnwein&#x27;s paintings and photographs attack this misconception, showing the variety of faces of which any face is capable. And in order to attack the basic misconception, he must underline and exaggerate by distortion, by bandages and metal instruments that force the face into impossible molds. Images of torture and madness abound, as happens from moment to moment in the face seen as a sensitive reflection of extreme perceptions and experience. How can a self-portrait depict statuesque calm in the face of the horrors that surround us all?

In a conversation with Robert A. Sobieszek, curator of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Helnwein declared: &quot;The reason why I took up the subject of self-portraits and why I have put myself on stage was to function as a kind of representative for the suffering, abused and oppressed human being. I needed a living body to demonstrate and exemplify the effect of violence inflicted upon a defenseless victim. There is nothing autobiographical or therapeutical about it, and I don&#x27;t think it says anything about me personally. Also I was the best possible model for my experiments: endlessly patient and always available.&quot;

===Comics and trivial art===
Another strong element in his works are comics. Helnwein has sensed the superiority of cartoon life over real life ever since he was a child. Growing up in a dreary, destroyed post-war Vienna, the young boy was surrounded by unsmiling people, haunted by a recent past they could never speak about. What changed his life was the first German-language Donald Duck comic book that his father brought home one day. Opening the book felt like finally arriving in a world where he belonged: &quot;a decent world where one could get flattened by steam-rollers and perforated by bullets without serious harm. A world in which the people still looked proper, with yellow beaks or black knobs instead of noses.&quot;

In 2000, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presented Helnwein&#x27;s painting &quot;Mouse I&quot; (1995, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210 cm x 310 cm) at the exhibition &quot;The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection&quot;.

Alicia Miller commented on Helnwein&#x27;s work in &quot;Artweek&quot;: &quot;In &#x27;The Darker Side of Playland&#x27;, the endearing cuteness of beloved toys and cartoon characters turns menacing and monstrous. Much of the work has the quality of childhood nightmares. In those dreams, long before any adult understanding of the specific pains and evils that live holds, the familiar and comforting objects and images of a child&#x27;s world are rent with something untoward. For children, not understanding what really to be afraid of, these dreams portend some pain and disturbance lurking into the landscape. Perhaps nothing in the exhibition exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein&#x27;s &#x27;Mickey&#x27;. His portrait of Disney&#x27;s favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.Helnwein&#x27;s Mickey is painted in shades of gray, as if pictured on an old black-and-white TV set. We are meant to be transported to the flickering edges of our own childhood memories in a time imaginably more blameless, crime-less and guiltless. But Mickey&#x27;s terrifying demeanor hints of things to come...&quot;.

Since 2018 the work &#x27;Dark Mousse&#x27; can be visited at Colección SOLO museum in Madrid, where it is part of its permanent exhibition.

Although Helnwein&#x27;s work is rooted in the legacy of German expressionism, he has absorbed elements of American pop culture. In the 1970s, he began to include cartoon characters in his paintings. In several interviews he claimed: &quot;I learned more from Donald Duck than from all the schools that I have ever attended.&quot; Commenting on that aspect in Helnwein&#x27;s work, Julia Pascal wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;: &quot;His early watercolor &quot;Peinlich&quot; (&quot;Embarrassing&quot;) shows a typical little 1950s girl in a pink dress and carrying a comic book. Her innocent appeal is destroyed by the gash deforming her cheek and lips. It is as if Donald Duck had met Mengele&quot;.

Living between Los Angeles and Ireland, Helnwein met and photographed the Rolling Stones in London, and his portrait of John F. Kennedy made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on the 20th anniversary of the president&#x27;s assassination. His self-portrait as screaming bandaged man, blinded by forks (1982) became the cover of the Scorpions album &quot;Blackout&quot;. Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, Burroughs and the German industrial metal band Rammstein posed for him; some of his art-works appeared in the cover-booklet of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; album. Referring to the fall of the Berlin Wall Helnwein created the book &quot;Some Facts about Myself&quot;, together with Marlene Dietrich. In 2003 he became friends with Marilyn Manson and started a collaboration with him on the multi-media art-project &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; and on several experimental video-projects. Among his widely published works is a spoof of the famous Edward Hopper painting &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, entitled &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, depicting Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. This painting in turn inspired the song of the same name by Green Day.

Examining his imagery from the 1970s to the present, one sees influences as diverse as Bosch, Goya, John Heartfield, Beuys and Mickey Mouse, all filtered through a postwar Viennese childhood. &#x27;Helnwein&#x27;s oeuvre embraces total antipodes: The trivial alternates with visions of spiritual doom, the divine in the child contrasts with horror-images of child-abuse. But violence remains to be his basic theme – the physical and the emotional suffering, inflicted by one human being unto another.&#x27;

===References to the Holocaust===

In 1988, in remembrance of the Night of the Broken Glass (Kristallnacht), which had happened 50 years earlier, Helnwein erected a large installation in the city center of Cologne, between Museum Ludwig and the Cologne Cathedral: &quot;Selektion – Neunter November Nacht (&quot;Selektion – Ninth November Night)&quot;. The gallery featured a four-meter-high, hundred-meter-long picture lane in which the artist recalls the events of Reichskristallnacht, often taken to be the beginning of the Holocaust, on November 9 1938. He confronts the passersby with larger-than-life children&#x27;s faces lined up in a seemingly endless row, as if for concentration camp selection. Just days into the exhibit, these portraits were vandalized by unknown persons, symbolically cutting the throats of the depicted children&#x27;s faces. Helnwein consciously left the panels with the gashes and included them in the presentation, as he believed that they made the work stronger and more relevant.

Mitchell Waxman wrote 2004, in &quot;The Jewish Journal&quot;, Los Angeles: &quot;The most powerful images that deal with Nazism and Holocaust themes are by Anselm Kiefer and Helnwein, although, Kiefer&#x27;s work differs considerably from Helnwein&#x27;s in his concern with the effect of German aggression on the national psyche and the complexities of German cultural heritage. Kiefer is known for evocative and soulful images of barren German landscapes. But Kiefer and Helnwein&#x27;s work are both informed by the personal experience of growing up in a post-war German speaking country. Burroughs said that the American revolution begins in books and music, and political operatives implement the changes after the fact. To this maybe we can add art. And Helnwein&#x27;s art might have the capacity to instigate change by piercing the veil of political correctness to recapture the primitive gesture inherent in art.&quot;.

One of the best known paintings of Helnwein&#x27;s oeuvre is &quot;Epiphany I&quot; – &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, (1996, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210 cm x 333 cm, collection of the Denver Art Museum). It is part of a series of three paintings: &quot;Epiphany I&quot;, &quot;Epiphany II (Adoration of the Shepherds)&quot;, &quot;Epiphany III (Presentation at the Temple)&quot;, created between 1996 and 1998. In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. To judge by their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. Julia Pascal wrote about this work in the New Statesman: &quot;This Austrian Catholic Nativity scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen SS officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary&#x27;s lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas.&quot; Helnwein&#x27;s baby Jesus is often considered to represent Adolf Hitler.

<text>David DeCoteau (born January 5, 1962) is an American film director and producer.

== Early life ==
David DeCoteau was born on January 5, 1962, in Portland, Oregon, where he was raised. DeCoteau was an only child and was adopted at birth. His father was of Native American heritage. 

DeCoteau&#x27;s mother died of cancer when he was eight years old. As a teenager, DeCoteau developed a love for film, and worked as a theater projectionist beginning at age fifteen.

== Career ==
He has worked professionally in the movie business since he was 18. He got his start through Roger Corman, who hired him in 1980 as a production assistant at New World Pictures. In 1986, DeCoteau directed and produced his first feature film for Charles Band. 

He is the founder of Rapid Heart Pictures, where his films include &quot;A Talking Cat!?!&quot; and the &quot;1313&quot; series. He has said of his working methods, &quot;I always wanted to make what I could sell. So I just promised myself that I would not be set in my ways. If somebody said, ‘Look, we need a horror film, we need a creature feature, we need a Western, we need a period costume drama,’ I was able to put it together pretty quickly.&quot;

Throughout his career DeCoteau has been credited under a variety of pseudonyms: Ellen Cabot, Julian Breen, Victoria Sloan, Richard Chasen, Jack Reed, Martin Tate, Joseph Tennent, and Mary Crawford. DeCoteau revealed that he originally did not want his name to be associated with films that did not turn out as intended.

<doc id="544694" wikidata="Q672170" url="?curid=544694" title="Publix">
<text>Publix Super Markets, Inc., doing business as Publix, is an employee-owned American supermarket chain headquartered in Lakeland, Florida. Founded in 1930 by George W. Jenkins, Publix is a private corporation that is wholly owned by present and past employees and members of the Jenkins family. Publix operates throughout the Southeastern United States, with locations in Florida (874), Georgia (217), Alabama (94), South Carolina (69), Tennessee (59), North Carolina (55), Virginia (22), and Kentucky (1). Kentucky is the most recent addition to the Publix footprint, with the company&#x27;s first store in that state having opened on January 10, 2024, in Louisville.

Publix operates 1,391 store locations across the Southeast. As of November 2024, Florida has the largest number of stores, with 874. As of the same date, Publix employs about 255,000 people at its retail locations, cooking schools, corporate offices, nine grocery distribution centers, and eleven manufacturing facilities. The manufacturing facilities produce its dairy, deli, bakery, and other food products. Publix is the largest employee-owned company in the United States.

== History ==
===Early history===

George Jenkins previously worked as a stock clerk and a manager at Piggly Wiggly from 1926 to 1930. Jenkins&#x27;s store had been bought out by a corporation. Jenkins went to share some ideas he had for the business but was turned down by corporate because the CEO was busy playing a game of golf. Jenkins left the store and aspired to create a new store, one where all ideas from associates and others were welcome. When Jenkins decided to open his own grocery store, he adopted the name &quot;Publix&quot; from a struggling New York-based movie theater company (with 19 opulently decorated movie houses in Florida) called Publix Theatres Corporation.

Jenkins stated, &quot;Most of the theaters were closing up, and I liked the sound of the name, so I just took it for my store.&quot; Jenkins opened the first Publix Food Store in Winter Haven, Florida, on September 6, 1930, a 3,000-square-foot building located at 58 Northwest 4th Street. In 1934, that store made $120,000 in sales. In 1935, he opened a second market, the Economy Food Store, also in Winter Haven. Despite the Great Depression, his stores were financially successful.

In 1940, Jenkins, called &quot;Mr. George&quot; by his employees, mortgaged an orange grove to build Florida&#x27;s first supermarket. On November 8, 1940, his &quot;food palace&quot; opened at 199 West Central Avenue, having piped-in music, air conditioning, cold cases for frozen and refrigerated items, in-store doughnut and flower shops, and electric-eye automatic doors. During World War II, material shortages prevented him from building additional stores. In 1945, Jenkins purchased the 19-store All American chain of food stores and converted them into Publix Super Markets.

In 1951, Publix moved its headquarters from Winter Haven to Lakeland, Florida, and built its first distribution warehouse there. The warehouse occupied a 70,000-square-foot area. At the same time, they began to close the All American stores, replacing them with Publix markets. In 1956, Publix achieved $50 million in sales and $1 million in profit. In 1957, the donut shop in each store was expanded into a full-service bakery.

===Florida expansion===

By 1959, Publix was the dominant supermarket chain in Central Florida, and began expansion to South Florida, opening a store in Miami and acquiring six stores from Grand Union. In 1963, the company built a distribution center in Miami, and began providing deli services. In 1970, sales surpassed $500 million; they reached $1 billion in 1974, when the chain expanded to include Jacksonville, Florida.

In 1982, the company launched the &quot;Presto!&quot; ATM network; it soon installed ATMs in every Publix. Sales exceeded $5 billion in 1989.

In 1983, Carol Jenkins Barnett joined the Publix Board of Directors and served in that role until 2016. During her time at Publix, the company grew into the largest supermarket chain in Florida, and expanded into five other states.
On October 5, 1995, Publix opened its 500th store in Miami, Florida.

Publix Super Markets bought 49 Florida stores from Albertsons. The deal was announced on June 9, 2008, and was completed on September 9, 2008. It included 15 locations in North Florida, 30 in Central Florida, and four in South Florida. The sale allowed Publix to operate four stores in a new market area for the company, Escambia County, Florida (the Pensacola area).

On February 5, 2009, Publix opened its 1,000th store in St. Augustine, Florida, becoming one of only five U.S. grocery retailers to achieve that number of stores. The St. Augustine store is among Publix&#x27;s first stores designed to be energy-efficient. The store includes motion sensor lights throughout the store, including on the freezer doors, and an overhead light system that can be controlled by each department.

===Southern expansion===
The first Publix outside Florida opened in Savannah, Georgia, in 1991; distribution and manufacturing facilities in Dacula, Georgia (a northeastern suburb of Atlanta), soon followed, as it entered metro Atlanta in 1993. Publix further expanded into South Carolina (1993), Alabama (1996), Tennessee (2002), North Carolina (2014), Virginia (2017), and Kentucky (2024).

In 2011, Publix announced it was expanding into North Carolina, initially by opening stores in the Charlotte metropolitan area, and later announced construction of a new store in Asheville. The first Charlotte-area Publix store (on the South Carolina side of the metropolitan area, opened in 2012); the first North Carolina Publix store opened in Ballantyne in 2014. Concurrently, Publix purchased seven Charlotte-area locations from competitor BI-LO stores. Publix completed the purchase of property in Boone, North Carolina, on November 20, 2015, with plans to open in 2017.

In February 2016, Publix announced their entry into the Virginia market, with the signing of two store leases, the first in Bristol scheduled to open in 2017 and the second in metropolitan Richmond scheduled for 2018. In July 2016, it was announced that Publix had entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold Delhaize for 10 Martin&#x27;s Food Markets locations in the Richmond market as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.

In April 2016, Ed Crenshaw, grandson of founder George Jenkins, retired from his position as CEO. President Todd Jones, a 36-year Publix employee whose first job was as a front service clerk (bagger), took on Crenshaw&#x27;s responsibilities as CEO. Jones is the first member outside of the Jenkins family to have assumed the position. Ed Crenshaw will remain with Publix as chairman of the board of directors.

==== Kentucky expansion ====

On September 7, 2021, Publix announced its first Kentucky location, initially expected to open in late 2023 in northeast Louisville near the intersection of the Gene Snyder Freeway and Old Henry Road. The first Publix Liquors location outside Florida is adjacent to this supermarket. The opening date was slightly delayed to January 10, 2024. Exactly three months after the Old Henry location was announced, Publix announced plans for a second northeast Louisville location, this one near the intersection of Ballardsville and Brownsboro Roads in the Worthington community. Expected to open in early 2024, this location will also feature an adjacent Publix Liquors store. On June 23, 2022, the same day that ground was broken for the Old Henry Road store, the company announced that it had signed a lease for a future store in Lexington at a development on the corner of Harrodsburg Road and Man o&#x27; War Boulevard. The Lexington store, including an adjacent Publix Liquors location, is planned to open in late 2024. A third Louisville location, on Shelbyville Road outside the Snyder Freeway in the far-eastern Eastwood area, was announced in December 2022 and is expected to open in the first half of 2024. It will also include an adjacent Publix Liquors store. New locations have also been announced for Owensboro and Elizabethtown.

===Response to the COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Publix started working with the federal and state agencies and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) beginning in late January 2020. The chain closed food demonstrations, and increased sanitation and routine cleaning, as well as installing plexiglas partitions at registers and customer service desks. As of July 21, 2020, face masks were required for all customers in all Publix facilities.

During the pandemic, Publix said it would purchase milk and fresh produce from farmers and dairies in Florida who faced reduced demand as a result of school and restaurant closures. Publix said the produce, which would otherwise be discarded, would be donated to food banks of Feeding America.

Publix started to administer COVID-19 vaccines in early January 2021, with a 22-store pilot in the state of Florida with a focus on long-term care residents and staff, seniors, and health-care personnel. As of mid-February, Publix had provided more than 300,000 vaccines for customers in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia. Publix has faced criticism over its extensive involvement in the distribution of vaccines in Florida, including allegations that it had curried favor with the Ron DeSantis administration by making a campaign donation through an affiliated PAC, and that Publix as exclusive distributor disproportionately favored wealthy neighborhoods.

Publix and the DeSantis administration deny that there was a pay-to-play arrangement; in an April 2021 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, DeSantis stated that Publix &quot;were the first one to raise their hand&quot; when Florida sought distribution partners for vaccines in retail (noting that CVS Health and Walgreens were largely focusing on vaccination at long-term care facilities), and that 90% of Florida&#x27;s senior population lived in close proximity to a Publix location, especially in Palm Beach (which has 65 locations, and was identified by the governor as &quot;one of the most elderly counties&quot;). These remarks were not included in the version of the interview aired by CBS, which has led to allegations that the interview had been edited to create a false narrative. The Democratic Party mayor of Palm Beach County Dave Kerner stated, &quot;The reporting was not just based on bad information — it was intentionally false. I know this because I offered to provide my insight into Palm Beach County&#x27;s vaccination efforts and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; declined.&quot;

== Stores ==

Each store provides products and services in its grocery, deli, bakery, produce, floral, meat, and seafood departments. Some stores have valet parking, cafés, sushi bars, pharmacy departments, and/or a liquor store. The submarine sandwiches sold at Publix delis are often referred to as &quot;Pub subs&quot;.

The customer service counter also provides check cashing, money orders, Western Union services, Rug Doctor rentals, and lottery tickets. Some stores also provide DVD rental services. In December 2005, Publix discontinued its photo processing service, replacing it with an online or mail-order service via the Snapfish program. The Snapfish agreement has since been terminated, and Publix no longer offers photo services.

=== Aprons ===
Aprons served as Publix&#x27;s in-house recipe brand, often promoting &quot;simple meals&quot; for customers to make at home. Each of the more than 4,000 recipes was developed by chefs.

In 2005, Publix introduced its Aprons make-ahead meals concept. Customers could purchase meals that they could assemble in-store or, for an extra charge, an Aprons associate would prepare and assemble the meals. These were standalone stores located in Jacksonville and Lithia, Florida. In summer 2009, Publix closed both locations citing lack of customer interest.

The brand expanded to include multiple cooking schools under the Aprons name, many of which offered catering as well. The schools offered cooking demonstrations as well as hands on cooking courses covering everything from meal prep to knife skills. By mid-2023, all Cooking School locations were permanently closed. While schools are no longer available, as of September 2024, Publix Cooking School Online videos were still accessible on YouTube.

=== Publix GreenWise Market ===

GreenWise Market is a retail concept the company introduced in 2007 in response to the increase in the number and profitability of health food stores such as Whole Foods Market. GreenWise Markets were created to increase awareness of nutrition; products under the GreenWise brand are free from added dyes, flavors, hormones, raised without antibiotics, or are USDA organic. These stores are similar to the Whole Foods Market chain. In addition to organic and traditional products, GreenWise Markets include salad and hot bars. The first six stores were set to be in Palm Beach Gardens, Boca Raton, Vero Beach, Tampa, Naples, and Coral Springs, Florida.

The first GreenWise Market opened on September 27, 2007, in Palm Beach Gardens. The second Publix GreenWise Market opened in Boca Raton on May 29, 2008, located in Boca Village Square. The third Publix GreenWise Market opened November 6, 2008, in Tampa&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood.
From 2008 to 2016, the company focused on a &quot;hybrid&quot; concept instead, integrating the GreenWise concept into traditional Publix stores. Approximately half of locations built since 2008 are considered hybrid stores.

In 2017, the company announced they would resume building standalone GreenWise locations, the first of which will be near the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee, opening in 2018.

In May 2023, Publix announced it would be discontinuing the GreenWise Market banner.

===Publix Sabor===
Publix operated seven stores, branded &quot;Publix Sabor&quot; (&quot;sabor&quot; is Spanish for &quot;flavor&quot;), which cater to Latinos living in South Florida and offer products from Latin America. Located in Miami-Dade County in Greater Miami, the seven themed stores are spread between Miami and Hialeah. They have since been closed and replaced by newly built locations or merged with existing stores that are not part of the Sabor sub-brand. Two other Publix Sabor locations in Kissimmee and Lake Worth

Publix Sabor locations have bilingual English-Spanish employees, open seating cafés, and a wider selection of prepared foods from the deli and bakery catering to Hispanic flavors.

===Pharmacy===

The first Publix in-store pharmacy was opened on October 30, 1986, in Altamonte Springs, Florida. By 1995, one-third of Publix stores had a pharmacy and today, approximately 90% of Publix stores include a pharmacy. Publix Pharmacies consistently ranked number one for customer satisfaction in supermarket pharmacies in several surveys conducted by independent research companies.

Publix announced in August 2007 that it would offer several types of antibiotics free to its customers. Several medical professionals expressed concerns that this could contribute to an overuse of antibiotics which leads to antibiotic resistance, a serious public health concern. 
====The Little Clinic====
In early 2006, Publix and The Little Clinic signed an exclusive agreement to open medical clinics within Publix stores. The first clinics were opened in the Atlanta, Miami, Orlando, and Tampa markets in the first half of 2006. The Little Clinic health-care centers were staffed by nurse practitioners who can write prescriptions, provide diagnosis and treatment of common ailments and minor injuries, and offer wellness care like physicals, screenings, and vaccinations. Effective May 9, 2011, Publix closed the Little Clinics in its stores in order to focus on its core pharmacy and grocery business.

==== BayCare telehealth sites ====
Publix and BayCare Health System announced a collaboration to provide telehealth and telemedicine services at specialized pharmacies in four Tampa Bay-area counties in March 2017. Pharmacies participating in the program have private rooms for patients to speak with a board-certified physician in BayCare&#x27;s network via teleconferencing, plus diagnostic tools that can be used by the patient, with or without assistance from pharmacy staff. Doctors will be able to perform basic exams and write prescriptions for minor illnesses and conditions for patients.

=== Online shopping and delivery services ===
==== PublixDirect ====
In October 2001, Publix launched its first online shopping site called PublixDirect that would deliver groceries directly to the customer. Their first distribution center was situated in Pompano Beach, Florida. Customers who lived in Broward along with parts of Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties were the first areas to have access to their new service. Service was intended to be expanded to Orlando, Atlanta and other areas. However, the service never saw expansion past the South Florida area. Due to low demand, it was announced that PublixDirect would cease operations on August 22, 2003. The remaining deliveries were made the next day with the remaining orders being canceled or redirected to the customer&#x27;s nearest Publix store.

==== Publix Curbside ====
After PublixDirect, Publix made a second attempt in 2010 at e-commerce with the introduction of Publix Curbside. Customers had the ability to browse and purchase groceries online, then drive to a participating location where an associate will have selected their items and would bring them out to the buyer&#x27;s vehicle. Announced as a pilot program with locations in the Atlanta area and Tampa, the program was ended in January 2012 after its performance reportedly did not meet expectations.

The company later resurrected its curbside concept, this time using its delivery partner, Instacart, to manage the online ordering portion of the service. Currently in a trial stage, the second iteration of Publix Curbside began with two pilot locations in the greater Tampa area in September 2017, and is expected to expand to the greater Atlanta area by the end of the year.

==== Instacart ====
In July 2016, Publix announced another pilot program with Instacart to offer online shopping and delivery services in the greater Miami area. Customers in 37 ZIP codes from Hallandale Beach to South Miami are able to participate in the program. Not all products available at stores, [such as tobacco, gift cards, prescriptions] and age-restricted items, are able to be delivered by the service. Beer and wine can be delivered in Florida and North Carolina only.

As of February 2017, Instacart deliveries from Publix are available in the metro areas of Atlanta, Charlotte, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, Raleigh, Richmond, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Nashville, as determined by ZIP code.

Later in 2017, Publix announced its intent to expand its delivery program, and expects to have the service available from more than 90 percent of stores by the end of the year.

=== Food World ===
In response to other grocery stores aggressively discounting across the Florida market, Publix opened its first Food World store in September 1970 in Orlando, Florida. The store marked the first under the Food World banner for Publix and would become the first of 22 more of the type.

In November 1977, in Lakeland, Florida, Publix opened the Lake Miriam Food World, which, at 57,000 sq. ft., was its largest store in the company and also the largest store in the Southeastern United States. The store was the company&#x27;s first to feature barcode scanners.

The brand was retired in 1985 because the stores were unable to turn a profit for Publix or give workers a percentage of their store&#x27;s profits.

=== Publix PIX ===
Starting in 2001, Publix operated 14 PIX (stylized in all capitals) gasoline-convenience stores in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. Locations were limited during the trial period of the concept. In 2014, all Florida and Georgia locations were sold to Circle K, the sole Tennessee location was sold to another entity, and the concept was discontinued. The locations were converted to other brands, as Publix retains the rights to &quot;PIX&quot;.

=== Crispers ===
In 2002, Publix invested in the Lakeland-based restaurant chain Crispers, which concentrates on health-conscious fare. It increased its stake in 2004 before purchasing the remainder of the company in 2007. In May 2011, Publix announced it had sold the Crispers chain to Healthy Food Concepts LLC. The stores had not performed well during the downturn and in recent years Publix closed several units, leaving the chain with 36 stores when the sale was announced.

=== Publix Liquors ===
Publix tested the market response to liquor stores in the late 1980s, but closed its test sites in 1989. It re-entered the liquor sales market again in 2003 and has met with success since. The liquor store is in an area accessed via a separate entrance as required by local laws, modeled after many other grocery chains. The first Publix Liquors location outside Florida opened in January 2024, alongside the first Publix in Kentucky.

=== DVD rental kiosks ===
In 2005, Publix began installing The New Release DVD rental kiosks within eight of its South Florida stores with expansion to other South Florida stores by 2006. The movie rentals were priced at $1 per day in addition to sales tax.

Following the purchase of The New Release by NCR in 2009, a partnership was formed with the NCR company and Blockbuster to replace the existing kiosks with Blockbuster Express kiosks. This replacement began the same year with additional kiosks being installed at all of the other Publix locations which was completed by 2010. The cost of the rentals remained the same.

In 2012, NCR sold its entertainment division, which includes the Blockbuster Express kiosks, to Coinstar, the then-owner of the Redbox DVD rental kiosks. Blockbuster Express machines were replaced with Redbox machines in most stores by the end of 2012.

Sometime between the second half of 2023 and early-mid 2024, the Redbox DVD rental kiosks began to be removed from Publix stores.

=== Starbucks ===
In December 2016, Publix opened its first in-store Starbucks location in the Orlando area, with five more opening throughout 2017.

=== &quot;Presto!&quot; ===

&quot;Presto!&quot; is a surcharge-free automated teller machine (ATM) network owned and operated by Publix Super Markets. Every Publix Super Market has at least one ATM, and as of September, 2024, there are over 1,350 &quot;Presto!&quot; ATMs. These span 8 states including: Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky. This network also includes point of sale (POS) capabilities, meaning that debit, credit, electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cash, or EBT food stamp cards can be used to make purchases at any Publix store and was introduced in the 1980s.

== Working environment ==
Publix has consistently been named one of Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For. The company is one of only five (as of 2021) to have made the list every year since its inception in 1998.

The company, founded in 1930, has never had a layoff.

In 1995 Publix was sued &quot;for sex discrimination in job assignments, promotions and allocation of hours&quot; and settled for $81.5 million in 1997. Publix had claimed that the suit was simply an effort by the United Food and Commercial Workers to unionize the company, but the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and required Publix to &quot;correct some of its statements.&quot;

Publix announced that effective January 1, 2015, health coverage would be available to same-sex couples regardless of place of marriage, as long as they are legally married. In early 2018, Publix came under fire by the Human Rights Campaign and other LGBT rights organizations for refusing to cover PrEP HIV prevention drugs under its employee health plans. Shortly after the furor, Publix changed its health plans to cover PrEP.

== Political giving ==
Publix political giving is coordinated through their Political Action Committee (PAC), which the company leverages to promote business interests.

According to the Miami New Times, Publix&#x27;s recent political leanings favor conservative causes, such as opposing the legalization of medical marijuana and the regulation of polystyrene, better known by the brand name Styrofoam. Publix also contributes to the PAC supporting Ron DeSantis, who some conservatives argue is a business-friendly governor. Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, contributions to other conservative leaders—specifically Adam Putnam—resulted in local protests in the Miami Area. Moments before the protests began, the company announced that it would suspend corporate-funded political contributions and reevaluate their political funding practices. Six days after halting political contributions, the Florida Retail Federation, a trade group heavily funded (&gt;80% in 2017) by Publix, donated an additional $100,000 to Putnam&#x27;s Florida Grown PAC.

In December 2020, Publix gave $100,000 to Florida governor Ron DeSantis&#x27;s PAC. While some attributed to this donation Publix&#x27;s partnership with the Florida government to provide COVID-19 vaccines to Florida residents, both the Governor and Publix spokeswoman Maria Brous rejected this claim as &quot;baseless and ridiculous&quot;. Publix was able to distribute vaccines to seniors in their markets, while national providers like Walgreens and CVS focused on broader efforts.

==Stock==

Publix stock is privately owned and restricted: it can only be purchased by current employees or board members during designated offering periods, and cannot be sold to anyone without first being offered back to Publix for repurchase.

Stock was made available to associates in 1959, originally priced at $10.00 per share.
Employees can acquire stock through three programs: an ESOP &quot;PROFIT&quot; plan, 401(k) &quot;SMART&quot; (Saving Makes A Richer Tomorrow) plan, and an employee stock purchase plan.

As of November 1, 2024, Publix stock is valued at $18.05 per share after a 5/1 stock split on April 1, 2022. Publix stock was quoted on the US OTC market under the code PUSH. It is listed on the 2021 Fortune 500 list at #69. As of November 2019, the stock is no longer listed on the OTC.

== Legal disputes ==
In 2003, Publix supported a successful bill that prevents owners from suing if their land is polluted by dry cleaning chemicals dumped on an adjacent property, if the adjacent property owners are on a state clean-up list. Publix lost a 2001 lawsuit filed by an owner whose property had been contaminated in this manner.

On October 4, 2005, Publix sued Visa and MasterCard, citing unfair business practices over their unannounced and non-negotiable increases in merchant account fees. Wal-Mart won a similar lawsuit against Visa in 2004.

In 2014, Publix was fined by the Board of Human Rights of Broward County, Florida for discrimination involved in the termination of an LGBT employee. Upon appeal, the 17th Circuit Court found that the decision by the Board of Human Rights of Broward County was &quot;not supported by competent, substantial evidence&quot; and quashed the order.

<text>Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, (16 April 1924 – 11 August 2010) was a British Conservative politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1959 to 2001, with only a brief interruption in the 1960s. He was also a television presenter.

==Early life and career==

The son of an electrical engineer, he joined the Royal Artillery straight from Charterhouse School in 1942 and after the war was demobilised as a captain.

At Lincoln College, Oxford, he read PPE. Contemporaries remembered him as Oxford&#x27;s best-dressed socialist, though he always insisted he never joined the Labour Party. In his final year he and Robin Day took part in a debating tour of United States run by the English-Speaking Union. From Oxford he joined the British Information Services, serving in San Francisco, where he met his wife, Jeanne, an American doctor whom he married in 1951.

He won a seat on London County Council in 1955, representing Putney, but lost it at the 1958 election.

He was later a presenter of the BBC magazine programme &quot;Tonight&quot; in the late 1950s.

==Political career==

Shortly before the 1959 general election, Cliff Michelmore, &quot;Tonight&quot;’s presenter, had a hernia operation and Johnson-Smith was promoted to co-host the show for six weeks. His profile was thus at its highest when the election was called, and on 8 October 1959 he ousted the Labour member for Holborn and St Pancras South, Lena Jeger, by 656 votes.

He successfully promoted a bill authorising councils to operate a meals-on-wheels service for the elderly and was soon on the fast track, within six months becoming PPS to ministers at the Board of Trade; in 1962 he moved to the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.

His parliamentary career was interrupted in October 1964 when Lena Jeger had her revenge by 2,756 votes as Labour came to power. He briefly returned to television, freelancing for the BBC and Rediffusion’s religious programmes.

However, he returned to the House of Commons the following year at a by-election in the safe Conservative seat of East Grinstead. When that constituency was abolished for the 1983 election, he was returned for the new Wealden constituency, and held that seat until he retired at the 2001 general election, having served 41 years in Parliament.

Sir Alec Douglas-Home quickly appointed him an Opposition whip, and when Edward Heath became leader that summer he made Johnson-Smith a party vice-chairman.

When Heath came to power in 1970 he kept Johnson-Smith at Central Office. Soon afterwards Iain Macleod died suddenly, the party Chairman Anthony Barber taking his place and Johnson-Smith becoming acting chairman. He was never in the running for the top job, despite his popularity among Conservative ladies, and in April 1971 he instead became Under-Secretary for Defense for the Army with special responsibility for the Ulster Defense Regiment.

Johnson-Smith, who was later to launch a successful campaign on behalf of haemophiliacs who had been given infected blood, fought a long battle to curb the Church of Scientology. The Church had its headquarters near East Grinstead and in 1970 he endured a six-week libel case before a jury vindicated his stance.

After the Bloody Sunday killings of January 1972, he mounted an uncompromising defence of the Parachute Regiment: &quot;It is bad enough for our troops to have to run all the perils and be shot at by gunmen without having their pain increased by smears in this House.&quot;

In November 1972, Heath moved him sideways to the Civil Service Department, with the remit of sharpening presentation of government policy. His time there was dominated by the Kenneth Littlejohn affair, which was still rumbling on when Heath called a snap election in February 1974. Johnson-Smith fought a skilful media campaign, but could not prevent Heath losing.

When Margaret Thatcher took the leadership, she asked him to oversee media activities at Central Office alongside a fellow television professional, Gordon Reece. After her 1979 election victory he joined the 1922 Committee executive and chaired the party&#x27;s backbench media committee.

From 1980 to 1996 he chaired the select committee on Member&#x27;s Interests, having to field embarrassing questions about the business activities of Thatcher&#x27;s son, Mark.

He served on the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute in the 1980s.

Johnson-Smith specialised increasingly in defence. From 1985 he chaired the military committee of the North Atlantic Assembly, and from 1987 to 1997 he led the British delegation. For six years he chaired the Conservative backbench defence committee.

==Later life and death==
He was knighted in 1982 and sworn of the Privy Council in 1996. Johnson-Smith died in Sussex on 11 August 2010, aged 86.

<text>William Heward Grafftey (August 5, 1928 – February 11, 2010) was a Canadian politician and businessman.

==Early life==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, to a wealthy family, he was a nephew of artist Prudence Heward of the Beaver Hall Group, and wrote a chapter about her in the 1996 book &quot;Portraits of a Life&quot;.

His father, Major Arthur Grafftey, was a First World War hero and board chairman of the Montreal Lumber Company.

Grafftey received a bachelor of arts degree from Mount Allison University, majoring in political science and history, and a bachelor of civil law degree from McGill University. He was admitted to the Bar of Quebec.

==Parliamentary career==
Grafftey was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1958 general election that returned John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservative (PC) Party in a landslide victory. A resident of the Eastern Townships, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Brome—Missisquoi from 1958 to 1968. From 1962 to 1963, Grafftey served as parliamentary secretary to Finance Minister George Nowlan. Due to his relatively short stature and impish looks, Grafftey earned the nickname of &quot;The Gnome from Brome,&quot; during his twenty years in politics.

In the 1964 Great Flag Debate, he was one of a handful of Conservative MPs—a group led by his fellow Quebecer Léon Balcer—who broke with leader John Diefenbaker to support the adoption of the Maple Leaf flag. Grafftey sat as a Tory MP until losing his seat when the Liberal Party under Pierre Trudeau won the 1968 election in a landslide. During this period, he called for radical reforms to Canada&#x27;s housing policies.

Grafftey returned to Parliament in the 1972 election, and was a candidate in the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election, in which he placed last on the first ballot, with 33 delegate votes. Like many of the other challengers in the race who were eliminated in the early ballots, Grafftey supported the eventual leadership winner, Joe Clark.

Clark became Prime Minister after winning a minority government in 1979, and Grafftey served as Minister of State for Social Programs and Minister of State for Science and Technology in Clark&#x27;s short-lived government before losing his seat again in the 1980 election. Grafftey supported Clark in the 1983 PC leadership election, in which the latter lost to Brian Mulroney, and was largely shut out of Quebec PC circles during the Mulroney years.

==Later political career==
Grafftey attempted to return to Parliament in the 2000 election, but was unsuccessful. After suffering a serious injury which incapacitated him for most of the campaign, he came in third place behind the Bloc Québécois challenger and Liberal incumbent MP Denis Paradis. He did, however, finish with the second highest vote total of any Progressive Conservative candidate in the province of Québec.

In 2002, he was one of the first Progressive Conservatives to call openly for Joe Clark, who had returned as Tory leader in 1998, to resign, offering himself as a replacement. Grafftey eventually ran as a PC leadership candidate in 2003. He ran a campaign that was devoid of defining policy proposals but which focused upon his political experience, his bilingualism and his belief that he could recruit 300,000 new members to help the PCs win the coming election. Although, like most of the candidates in the race, he supported the twin Progressive Conservative pillars of North American free trade and support for decentralizing reforms to the Constitution of Canada, he often found himself in agreement with the left wing of his party, sharing maverick candidate David Orchard&#x27;s opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Grafftey&#x27;s candidacy received some media attention largely because he was the only candidate in the race who was fluently bilingual (in English and French) and had experience in governing. Yet Grafftey&#x27;s age (75 at the time) was also mocked by political satirists as an indication of the lack of &quot;new blood&quot; in the PC Party. Grafftey withdrew several days prior to the vote for health reasons. Analysts suggest that Grafftey had 72 committed delegates hailing largely from several Montreal-area ridings. Most of Grafftey&#x27;s delegates entered the convention as &quot;undeclared delegates&quot;. He did not attend the convention, nor did he endorse any other leadership candidate, though many of his rural backers went over to David Orchard.

After the 2003 convention, Grafftey briefly re-entered the political spotlight by joining Orchard and other former Tories in opposition to a proposed merger of the party with the Canadian Alliance. They were unsuccessful, with the Conservative Party of Canada officially forming in 2004. Grafftey still insisted that he was a &quot;Progressive Conservative&quot;. He ran in Brome—Missisquoi for the Progressive Canadian Party in the 2006 federal election and came in fifth place with 1,921 votes—4% of the total ballots cast.

==Other interests==
Grafftey was active in business circles up to his death and was the CEO of SafetySense, which publishes basic safety booklets for businesses and schools.

In 2001, he wrote a book on the state of Canadian politics entitled &quot;Democracy Challenged: How to End One-Party Rule in Canada&quot;.

==Personal life==
He has three children: Arthur Heward, Clement Tae Yong, and Leah Yoon Hee. His marriage to Alida Grace Visser ended in divorce. He neither declared nor denied being gay. &quot;I never had to come out, because it was never an issue. I was never in. I was always me,&quot; he once said. Grafftey declared his sexual orientation when he disrupted and stormed out of a service at St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church in Montreal after the priest delivered what he considered a homophobic sermon.

Grafftey died February 11, 2010, at the Royal Victoria Hospital from complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="544702" wikidata="Q2078392" url="?curid=544702" title="Peter Snape">
<text>Peter Charles Snape, Baron Snape (born 12 February 1942) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for West Bromwich East from February 1974 until he stood down in the 2001 election. He is the former chairman of his hometown football club, Stockport County, as well as being a major shareholder in the club at the time. Lord Snape became Vice-Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Speedway Racing in July 2015.

==Career==
He once lived at Greenwood Gardens, Bredbury and was a railwayman and Bredbury and Romiley Urban District councillor representing Bredbury South ward. He was elected as Labour Member of Parliament for West Bromwich East in 1974, after which he moved to live in Buglawton. He retained links with the Bredbury area, serving for a time as a director of Stockport County Football Club, which he is now once again as of 2010. He held a number of government posts.

He was the member who formally proposed Michael Martin to be the new Speaker in 2000. He stood down in the 2001 election and was created a life peer as Baron Snape, of Wednesbury in the County of West Midlands on 9 June 2004.

==Orange juice incident==
During the 1992 General Election campaign, Conservative MP Edwina Currie poured a glass of orange juice over Snape shortly after an edition of the Midlands-based debate show &quot;Central Weekend&quot; had finished airing. Speaking about the incident later, Currie said, &quot;I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought &#x27;I know how to shut you up.&#x27;&quot;

== Controversy ==
In late January 2009 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; alleged that Lord Snape was one of four Labour Lords who had agreed to support legislative changes that were favourable to large businesses in exchange for cash. Two of its reporters, posing as lobbyists for a foreign company looking to set up a chain of shops in the UK, approached a range of peers to see if they could be bribed to help the company to obtain an exemption from the Business Rates Supplements Bill. The paper stated Snape agreed to do so in exchange for a fee of £24,000.

The House of Lords Sub-committee on Lords&#x27; Interests was asked to report on the matter. Although the sub-committee found that Lord Snape &quot;expressed a clear willingness to breach the Code of Conduct&quot;, the Privileges Committee considered the matter and took further evidence, concluding that he did not &quot;express clear willingness to [act] in return for financial inducement,&quot;.

They found no reason to doubt Snape&#x27;s &quot;assertion that his intention to consult the Registrar before taking any steps was genuine, the meeting with the journalists was on Thursday, and they telephoned him within 24 hours to reveal the sting.&quot;
However, they felt his conversation with the journalists &quot;demonstrated an inappropriate attitude to the rules governing the conduct of Members&quot; and they therefore invited him to make a personal statement of apology to the House.

The Sunday Times agreed to publish the findings of the Privileges Committee and agreed to pay a &#x27;substantial sum&#x27; towards Lord Snape&#x27;s legal costs.

<doc id="544705" wikidata="Q47693" url="?curid=544705" title="Capella Tower">
<text>Capella Tower (also 225 South Sixth) is an office skyscraper in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The building opened in 1992 as First Bank Place, replacing One Financial Plaza as the headquarters for First Bank System. In 1997, First Bank System acquired US Bancorp and changed the name of the building to US Bancorp Place. The headquarters of US Bancorp moved into the US Bancorp Center in 2000, whereupon the tower changed to 225 South 6th Street. In March 2009, the building took its present name.

The ranking of the building as the tallest in Minneapolis is in dispute. The IDS Center is usually said to be taller by one foot, even by the owners of Capella Tower. It was initially said to be built one foot shorter out of respect for the IDS Center; however, in 2005, it was revealed that contractors had surreptitiously added of height to Capella, therefore making it taller than the main roof of IDS Center. In February 2005, the IDS counted a window washing garage built on its roof in 1979 as part of its actual height, making it taller than Capella Tower. This ambiguity between official measurements and public relations statements might be due in some part to the &quot;halo&quot; that extends out from the roof, which is apparently included in the building&#x27;s official height (though this is unclear).

The IDS is taller on two measures. The IDS&#x27;s communications spires add a significant amount of height making it , and it remains the tallest building in Minneapolis if measured by number of stories (57 vs. 56; actually tied for first with neighbor Wells Fargo Center).

Capella Tower is connected to the Minneapolis Skyway System and has . of office space.
== Name origin ==

In March 2008, Capella Education Co., longtime occupant of the building and owner of the for-profit online Capella University, signed a lease that changed the name of the tower to Capella Tower. The new lease expands Capella&#x27;s square footage in the building from to about , making it the largest tenant in the building. The expanded facility houses all of the company&#x27;s 1,150 downtown Minneapolis employees; as the online school does not have classrooms, the space houses administrative staff and faculty. The name change took place in March 2009.

==Design==
The office building, designed by Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; Partners, is laid out on an L-shaped site with the 58-story tower connected to the 20-story Star Tribune Building by an atrium. The building combines six-story cubes and various round towers which echo the different styles of buildings in downtown Minneapolis. The illuminated semicircle located atop the tower is not only decorative but also houses an antenna farm and communications network. This feature has given the building the nickname the &quot;Halo Building&quot;.

<doc id="544707" wikidata="Q4697743" url="?curid=544707" title="Air Atlanta">
<text>Air Atlanta was an airline based in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, during the mid-1980s, serving over a dozen cities from its hub located at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).

== History ==
The airline was started in February 1984, by attorneys Michael Hollis and Daniel Kolber. Besides operating point to point service as an independent air carrier, it also provided passenger feed for Pan American World Airways as &quot;Air Atlanta Pan Am Express&quot;, connecting Pan Am passengers to and from flights operated by Air Atlanta.

Air Atlanta&#x27;s first scheduled route was Atlanta-Memphis, with the first flight being operated on February 1, 1984, using a Boeing 727-100 jetliner. By April 1, 1984, nonstop 727 service was being operated Atlanta-Memphis, Atlanta-Miami and Atlanta-New York JFK Airport. By July 1, 1985, Atlanta-New York LaGuardia Airport nonstop service had been added as well. The airline subsequently introduced service to Detroit, Fort Myers, Greenbrier/Lewisburg, WV, New Orleans, Orlando, Philadelphia, Tampa, and Washington National Airport in Crystal City, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C.

When Air Atlanta initially began service, every seat was a first class seat with meals served on white linen accompanied by fine china and crystal although the airline stated that it was charging coach fares for this service. Air Atlanta then introduced two class service on its Boeing 727 aircraft with 2-2 seating in first class and 2-3 seating in coach with the latter cabin usually being configured with 3-3 seating by most other air carriers that operated the 727. The airline flew three million passengers before it shut down on April 2, 1987, when it filed bankruptcy. At the time it filed, KLM offered to invest $10 million in Air Atlanta if the existing investors would match it. The existing investors declined even though Air Atlanta was making progress. Air Atlanta had a perfect safety record and was responsible for many innovations in the airline industry including with respect to financing its operations through the use of the zero coupon convertible note.

== Fleet ==
The Air Atlanta fleet began with five Boeing 727-100 aircraft. Five Boeing 727-200s were added as time passed.

==Destinations ==

Air Atlanta operated scheduled passenger flights to the following destinations at various times during its existence:
*Georgia
**Atlanta (William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport) – primary hub 
*Colorado
**Gunnison (Gunnison-Crested Butte Regional Airport) - &quot;seasonal weekend service from Atlanta during the 1985 winter ski season&quot;
*Florida
**Ft. Myers (Southwest Florida International Airport)
**Miami (Miami International Airport)
**Orlando (Orlando International Airport)
**Tampa (Tampa International Airport)
*Louisiana
**New Orleans (New Orleans International Airport)
*Michigan
**Detroit (Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport)
*New York
**New York City (John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport)
*Pennsylvania
**Philadelphia (Philadelphia International Airport)
*Tennessee
**Memphis (Memphis International Airport)
*Virginia
**Crystal City—Washington, D.C., area (Washington National Airport)
*West Virginia
**Lewisburg (Greenbrier Valley Airport)

The majority of the flights operated by Air Atlanta were operated to and from Atlanta (ATL) on a nonstop point to point basis. Several exceptions were nonstop service operated between New York JFK Airport and Lewisburg, West Virginia, via the Greenbrier Valley Airport (LWB), between New York JFK Airport and Philadelphia (PHL) as well as between Tampa (TPA) and Orlando (MCO) and also between Tampa and Fort Myers (RSW). In addition, Air Atlanta operated direct one stop service between a number of its destinations with most of these flights making an intermediate stop in Atlanta which also served as the airline&#x27;s connecting hub.

<text>David James Christian Faber (born 7 July 1961) is a schoolmaster and former Conservative member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He did not seek re-election in 2001, after which he became an author, before in 2010 being appointed as head master of Summer Fields School, Oxford. He is the grandson of the late former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan (1894–1986).

==Family and early life==
The son of Julian and Lady Caroline Faber, Faber comes from an aristocratic political family drawn from the Whig and latterly the Conservative traditions. His maternal grandfather Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister at the time of his birth. His maternal grandmother, Lady Dorothy Cavendish, was descended from three Prime Ministers, the 4th Duke of Devonshire (1756–1757), the 2nd Earl of Shelburne (1782–1783) and the 3rd Duke of Portland (1783 and 1807–1809). Faber&#x27;s great-great-great-granduncle was Lord Hartington and his great-grandfather Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire was also a statesman. His mother&#x27;s cousins included Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire, who was married to Deborah Mitford, and Andrew&#x27;s elder brother William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, who was married to Kathleen Kennedy, the sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy. His uncle Maurice Macmillan was a leading figure of Edward Heath&#x27;s 1970s government.

Faber was educated at Summer Fields School, Summertown; and then at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. As an undergrad, Faber was a member of the Bullingdon Club, an all-male dining club for Oxford University students dating back to 1780. It is known for its wealthy members, grand banquets, and bad behaviour, including vandalism of restaurants and students&#x27; rooms.

==Life and career==
Faber first stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, in 1987 at Stockton North, where he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Frank Cook.

He worked in marketing and as a political assistant to Jeffrey Archer before entering the House of Commons in 1992 as Conservative Member of Parliament for Westbury. He was parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, 1994 to 1996, and then to the Secretary of State for Health, from 1996 to 1997. In opposition, after the Conservatives lost the 1997 general election, he was their front bench spokesman on Foreign and Commonwealth affairs, until 1998. He served as a member of several Parliamentary select committees: Social Security, 1992–1997, Culture, Media and Sport, 1998 to 2001, and the Public Accounts Committee, 2000–2001.

Faber stood down from parliament at the 2001 general election, to be succeeded by fellow Conservative Andrew Murrison, when he began a new career as a writer. His book &quot;Speaking for England: Leo, Julian and John Amery, the tragedy of a political family&quot; (2005) was about Julian Amery, his uncle by his (Amery&#x27;s) marriage to Faber&#x27;s maternal aunt, Julian&#x27;s father Leo, and brother John, who was executed after the Second World War for high treason.

In 2009, he was appointed as head of his old prep school, Summer Fields, with effect from September 2010.

Faber married firstly Sally Gilbert, a television weather presenter, and they had one son together, but later divorced, with Faber citing James Hewitt as co-respondent. He married secondly Sophie Amanda Hedley, and they have two daughters. He is a past committee member of the Marylebone Cricket Club, the governing body of the game of cricket, managing an MCC tour of Canada in 2001. He is also a member of White&#x27;s.

<text>Robert Heath Dennard (September 5, 1932 – April 23, 2024) was an American electrical engineer and inventor.

==Biography==
Dennard was born in Terrell, Texas. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in 1954 and 1956, respectively. He earned a Ph.D. from Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1958. His professional career was spent as a researcher for International Business Machines.

Single Transistor DRAM

At the time of the invention, Dennard and his colleagues were fixated on a bulky, costly memory system that used a series of six transistors to store just 1 bit of data.

In 1966 he invented the one transistor memory cell consisting of a transistor and a capacitor for which a patent was issued in 1968. It became the basis for today&#x27;s dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and almost all other memory types such as SRAM and FLASH memory. DRAM was instrumental in changing the world of computing through faster and higher capacity memory access. Today, DRAM is used pervasively across many devices from servers to personal computers to mobile devices. 

Dennard Scaling

Dennard was also among the first to recognize the tremendous potential of downsizing MOSFETs. The scaling theory he and his colleagues formulated in 1974 postulated that MOSFETs continue to function as voltage-controlled switches while all key figures of merit such as layout density, operating speed, and energy efficiency improve – provided geometric dimensions, voltages, and doping concentrations are consistently scaled to maintain the same electric field. This property underlies the achievement of Moore&#x27;s Law and the evolution of microelectronics over the last few decades.As of 2024, the DRAM market is estimated to be over $100 billion.

Awards and Recognition

In 1984, Dennard was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering work in FET technology, including invention of the one transistor dynamic RAM and contributions to scaling theory.

Besides his technical accomplishments, Dennard was involved in other creative fields. Throughout his retirement, Dennard continued to fuel his creativity through choral singing and Scottish dancing.

Dennard died on April 23, 2024, at the age of 91.

<doc id="544713" wikidata="Q179897" url="?curid=544713" title="List of knights of St Patrick">
<text>The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick is a British order of chivalry associated with Ireland. The Order was created in 1783 by George III at the instigation of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, The 3rd Earl Temple (1753–1813; created The 1st Marquess of Buckingham in 1784). The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1921, when most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State. While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, died in 1974. The King, however, remains the Sovereign of the Order. The position of King of Arms of the order was held by Ulster King of Arms; this office still exists, since 1943 it has been combined with Norroy King of Arms. St Patrick is patron of the order; its motto is &quot;Quis separabit?&quot;, Latin for &quot;Who will separate us?&quot;: an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8:35, &quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&quot;

The first appointments were made on 11 March 1783, and consisted of 15 Knight Founders, and in total there have been 145 appointments. The original Royal Warrant (dated 5 February 1783) specified that there were to be no more than fifteen knights of the Order at any one time, something that changed in 1821 when George IV appointed an extra six knights (although the royal warrant was not altered to reflect this change until 1830). William IV appointed an additional four knights at his coronation, and on 24 January 1833 increased the maximum number of knights to 22.

<text>Practical Ethics, a 1979 book by the moral philosopher Peter Singer, is an introduction to applied ethics.

==Summary==

Singer analyzes, in detail, why and how beings&#x27; interests should be weighed. In his view, a being&#x27;s interests should always be weighed according to that being&#x27;s concrete properties, and not according to its belonging to some abstract group. Singer studies a number of ethical issues including race, sex, ability, species, abortion, euthanasia, infanticide, embryo experimentation, the moral status of animals, political violence, overseas aid, and whether we have an obligation to assist others. The 1993 second edition adds chapters on refugees, the environment, equality and disability, embryo experimentation, and the treatment of academics in Germany. A third edition published in 2011 omits the chapter on refugees, and contains a new chapter on climate change.

==Reception==
&quot;Practical Ethics&quot; is widely read and was described as &quot;an excellent text for an introductory ethics course&quot; by the philosopher John Martin Fischer. The philosopher James Rachels recommended the book &quot;as an introduction centered on such practical issues as abortion, racism, and so forth.&quot; The philosopher Mylan Engel called the book &quot;must reading for anyone interested in living an ethical life.&quot;

H. L. A. Hart&#x27;s review of the first edition in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; was mixed. While writing that &quot;The utility of this utilitarian&#x27;s book to students of its subject can hardly be exaggerated&quot;, Hart also criticized &quot;Practical Ethics&quot; for philosophical inconsistency in its chapter on abortion. He argues that Singer insufficiently explains how preference and classical utilitarianism each view abortion, and does not bring out their differences.

<text>Tabiteuea (formerly Drummond&#x27;s Island) is an atoll in the Gilbert Islands, Kiribati, farther south of Tarawa. This atoll is the second largest and the most populated of the Gilbert Islands after Tarawa. The atoll consists of one main island, Aanikai in the north, and several smaller islets in between along the eastern rim of the atoll. The atoll has a total land area of , while the lagoon measures . The population numbered 5,261 in 2015. The islanders have customary fishing practices related to the lagoon and the open ocean.

While most atolls of the Gilbert Islands correspond to local government areas governed by island councils, Tabiteuea, like the main atoll Tarawa, is divided into two:

* North Tabiteuea (in Gilbertese, &quot;Tabiteuea Meang&quot;) has a land area of and a population of 3,955 , distributed among twelve villages (capital Utiroa)
* South Tabiteuea (&quot;Tabiteuea Maiaki&quot;) has a land area of and a population of 1,306, distributed among six villages (capital Buariki).

==History==
&quot;Tabiteuea&quot; is Gilbertese for &quot;no chief allowed&quot;; the island is traditionally egalitarian and is known for its huge maneaba.

On 1 July 1799, Charles Bishop and George Bass entered in the lagoon of Tabiteuea and many canoes visited his brig &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Bishop called it Bishop’s Island, and called Aanikai, Drummond’s Island.

The Battle of Drummond&#x27;s Island occurred during the United States Exploring Expedition in April 1841 at Tabiteuea, then known as Drummond&#x27;s Island. After one sailor from sloop USS &quot;Peacock&quot;, was missing without reason, the US party decided on exacting redress for the incident. Twelve islanders were killed in the fighting and others were wounded. Utiroa village with more than 1,000 inhabitants, was burned and erased.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate States Navy steamer CSS Shenandoah visited the island on March 23, 1865 in search of United States whalers, but the whalers had fled the area. Captain James Waddell described the islanders as &quot;of copper colour, short of statue, athletic in form, intelligent and docile&quot; and were &quot;without a stitch of clothing&quot;.

In the late 1800s, the two parts of the island were the site of a religious war when the populace of North Tabiteuea, partly converted to Christianity and, led by a Hawaiian pastor called Kapu who had assembled a &quot;hymn-singing army on a crusade&quot;, invaded and conquered South Tabiteuea, where was recently (1860) created a cult of Tioba (Jehovah).

Bishop Octave Terrienne built his main Catholic Church in Tanaeang, North Tabiteuea in 1936 and established there the see of his apostolic vicariate of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

Tabiteuea Post Office opened around 1911 and was renamed Tabiteuea North around 1972. Tabiteuea South Post Office opened on 13 September 1965.
==Education==
There is a government high school, Tabiteuea North Senior Secondary School, also known as Teabike College. Located in Eita, it serves the entire island.

There is also a government junior high school, Takoronga School in Terikiai, serving all of Tab North.

The elementary schools on Tab North are all government schools. They include:

* Aiwa: Nukantewaa School, which also serves Bangai
* Buota: Taunibong School, which also serves Tanaeang
* Eita: Temwamwang School, which serves a portion of Eita as well as Utiroa; the school does not serve all of Eita, as Eita and Utiroa are both the settlements with the most people in Tabiteuea North.

Taunibong School in Buota serves as the elementary school. The area junior high school is Takoronga School in Terikiai, and the area senior high school is Tabiteuea North Senior Secondary School a.k.a. Teabike College in Eita.

* Kabuna: Kabuna School
* Tekaman: Burannikoraoi School, which also serves Tekabwibwi
* Terikiai: Takoronga School, which also serves a section of Eita; Kiribati authorities included a section of Eita in its attendance zone to relieve Temwamwang School
* Tanaatoorua: Ueen Maungan te Raoi School, which also serves Bangai
* Taumwa: Auriaria School
* Taku: Taku School

Students from Bangai may attend either Nukantewaa School or Ueen Maungan te Raoi School; Bangai does not have enough residents, so the Kiribati authorities do not operate a school there.

==Transport==
There are two domestic airports:

* Tabiteuea North Airport that is the main hub serving the southern Gilbert Islands;
* Tabiteuea South Airport, only serving South Tabiteuea.

<text>Trần Anh Hùng (English: Anh Hung Tran), born December 23, 1962) is a Vietnamese-French filmmaker.

==Early life and education ==
Hung was born in Da Nang, South Vietnam. Following the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, he immigrated to France at age 12.

Hung majored in philosophy at a university in France. By chance, he saw Robert Bresson&#x27;s film &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; and decided to study film instead. He went on to study photography at the National School Supérieure Louis-Lumière, which trains cinematographers and supported himself by working in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay bookshop.

==Film career==
Hung has been at the forefront of a wave of acclaimed overseas Vietnamese cinema over the past two decades. His films have received international fame and acclaim, and his first three features were varied meditations on life in his home country of Vietnam.

Hung&#x27;s Oscar-nominated debut (for Best foreign film) was &quot;The Scent of Green Papaya&quot; (1993), which also won two top prizes at the Cannes Film Festival. His follow-up &quot;Cyclo&quot; (1995, which featured Hong Kong movie star Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival. &quot;The Vertical Ray of the Sun&quot;, released in 2000, was the third film in his &quot;Vietnam trilogy.&quot;

After a sabbatical, Hung returned with the noir psychological thriller &quot;I Come with the Rain&quot; (2009), which featured a star-studded international cast including Josh Hartnett and Elias Koteas.

Hung directed &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, an adaptation of Haruki Murakami&#x27;s novel of the same name, which was released in Japan in December 2010.

==Films on Vietnam==
In France, Hung studied at the prestigious film school, Louis Lumière. For his graduation project in 1987 he wrote and directed a short film &quot;La femme mariée de Nam Xuong&quot;, inspired by an old Vietnamese folk tale (&quot;Truyền kỳ mạn lục&quot;).

Following this Hung made another short film, &quot;La pierre de l&#x27;attente&quot; (1989), before launching the feature film &quot;The Scent of Green Papaya&quot; (1993). &quot;The Scent of Green Papaya&quot; was acclaimed for its style and its beautiful images of Vietnamese life. To date, the film is the only representative of Vietnamese cinema to be nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The success of &quot;Papaya&quot; helped Hung gain funding for the next film, &quot;Cyclo&quot;. The film tells stories of poor people living in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), and was filmed on location there. &quot;Cyclo&quot; won the Golden Lion at 52nd Venice International Film Festival, and at the age of 33, Hung was one of the youngest filmmakers to be thus honored there.

Having depicted life in Ho Chi Minh City, Hung turned his attention to Hanoi in &quot;The Vertical Ray of the Sun&quot; (2000). The main characters of the film are three sisters who idolize their parents&#x27; family life, before the truth is revealed after the mother&#x27;s death.

==Influences and style of film-making==
Hung&#x27;s films are made to rebuild the image of Vietnam that he lost when immigrating to France, and to provide the audience with another point of view on Vietnam when this topic has been long dominated by French and American cinema. The stories are based on Hung&#x27;s knowledge about Vietnamese culture and (in the second and third films) his first-hand experience gained from trips to the country.

Hung is strongly influenced by French cinema and from some European and Japanese filmmakers, namely Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky and Ozu.

Hung&#x27;s style of filmmaking is expressed through the claim: &quot;Art is the truth wearing a mask&quot;.
He denies the conventional story-telling style and pursues making films with a new language: &quot;to challenge the audiences&#x27; feelings, making them enjoy the films not with the critical reasoning but the language of the body&quot;.

As a banner of Vietnamese films, Hung, a French-Vietnamese director, shattered the stereotypical images of poverty and backwardness depicted in prior American and French films with his unique camera images, showing the audience a Vietnam where tenderness and cruelty coexist. In Vietnam, Hung&#x27;s most famous &quot;trilogy&quot;—&quot;The Scent of Green Papaya&quot; (1993), &quot;Cyclo&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Vertical Ray of the Sun&quot; (2000)—expresses feelings for his country.

<text>Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) is a graphical &quot;system design and development&quot; &quot;platform&quot; produced and distributed by National Instruments, based on a programming environment that uses a visual programming language. It is widely used for data acquisition, instrument control, and industrial automation. It provides tools for designing and deploying complex test and measurement systems.

The visual (aka graphical) programming language is called &quot;G&quot; (not to be confused with G-code). It is a dataflow language originally developed by National Instruments. LabVIEW is supported on a variety of operating systems (OSs), including macOS and other versions of Unix and Linux, as well as Microsoft Windows.

The latest versions of LabVIEW are LabVIEW 2024 Q3 (released in July 2024) and LabVIEW NXG 5.1 (released in January 2021). National Instruments released the free for non-commercial use LabVIEW and LabVIEW NXG Community editions on April 28, 2020.

== Dataflow programming ==
The programming paradigm used in the LabVIEW &quot;G&quot; language is based on data availability. If there is enough data available to a function, it will execute. The execution flow is determined by the structure of a graphical block diagram (the LabVIEW-source code) on which the programmer places &quot;nodes&quot; and connects them by drawing &quot;wires&quot;. A node can be a &quot;control&quot;, &quot;indicator&quot;, &quot;structure&quot;, &quot;function,&quot; or recursively, &quot;another block diagram&quot;. An example of a simple four-node block diagram is two controls and an indicator wired to the addition function, causing the indicator to display the sum of the two controls. The wires connecting nodes propagate data as variables, and any node can execute as soon as all its input variables (data) become available. Since this might be the case for multiple nodes simultaneously, LabVIEW can conceptually execute in parallel. Multi-processing and multi-threading hardware is exploited automatically by the built-in scheduler, which multiplexes multiple OS threads over the nodes ready for execution.

== Graphical programming ==

LabVIEW integrates the creation of user interfaces (termed front panels) into the program development cycle. LabVIEW programs are collections of one or more &quot;virtual instruments&quot; (VIs). Each VI has three components, a &quot;front panel&quot;, &quot;back panel&quot;, and &quot;connector panel&quot;, all composed of nodes and wires represented graphically to the user. The &quot;front panel&quot; is built using controls and indicators. Controls are inputs, they allow a user to supply information to the VI. Indicators are outputs, they indicate or display the results based on the inputs given to the VI. The &quot;back panel&quot; consists of a &quot;block diagram&quot; containing the graphical source code. All of the objects placed on the front panel will appear in the back panel block diagram as terminals. The block diagram also contains structures and functions, chosen from a Functions palette, which perform operations on controls and supply data to indicators. The &quot;connector panel&quot; has terminals whose wires go to or come from nodes in the front and back panels, and is used to represent the VI within the back panel of upstream (calling) VIs and downstream (called) VIs to which it might be connected.

There are two ways to run a VI. It can be run by itself as a program, with the front panel serving as a user interface. Alternatively, it can be treated as a node that is dropped onto the block diagram of another VI and wired to its nodes through the connector panel. In that case it runs as a subroutine within a larger program, and the front panel controls the inputs and outputs of the VI node. Thus, each VI can be easily tested as a stand-alone program before being embedded as a subroutine into a larger program.

The &quot;G&quot; graphical approach allows non-programmers to easily build programs by dragging and dropping virtual representations of lab equipment with which they are already familiar. The LabVIEW programming environment includes examples and documentation to guide and simplify the creation of small applications. As with all introductory programming guides, the ease of construction of working &quot;G&quot; programs may cause the programmer to underestimate the expertise needed for high-quality &quot;G&quot; programming. For complex algorithms or large-scale code, a programmer must possess extensive knowledge of the special LabVIEW syntax and the topology of its memory management. The most advanced LabVIEW development systems offer the ability to build stand-alone applications. Furthermore, it is possible to create distributed applications that communicate using a simple client–server model which takes advantage of the inherently parallel nature of &quot;G&quot;.

== Common application design patterns ==
Applications in LabVIEW are typically designed using well-known architectures known as design patterns. The most common design patterns for graphical LabVIEW applications are listed in the table below.
== Features and Resources ==

=== Interfacing to devices ===
LabVIEW includes extensive support for interfacing to instruments, cameras, and other devices. Users interface to hardware by either writing direct bus commands (USB, GPIB, Serial) or using high-level, device-specific drivers that provide native &quot;G&quot; function nodes for controlling the device. National Instruments makes thousands of device drivers available for download on their &quot;Instrument Driver Network&quot; (IDNet).

LabVIEW has built-in support for other National Instruments products, such as the CompactDAQ and CompactRIO hardware platforms and &quot;Measurement and Automation eXplorer&quot; (MAX) and &quot;Virtual Instrument Software Architecture&quot; (VISA) toolsets.

=== Code compiling and execution ===
LabVIEW includes a compiler that translates &quot;G&quot; code into native code for supported CPU platforms. The graphical code is converted into Dataflow Intermediate Representation, and then translated into chunks of executable machine code by a compiler based on LLVM. These code chunks are called by the &quot;G&quot; run-time engine, providing for fast, high-performance native execution of the graphical code. The LabVIEW syntax is strictly enforced during the editing process, and when &quot;G&quot; code is run or saved, the compiler is automatically invoked. &quot;G&quot; code is saved to a single binary file that contains both the source and executable code. Execution is controlled by the run-time engine, which contains some pre-compiled code to perform common tasks defined in the &quot;G&quot; language. The run-time engine manages execution flow, and provides a consistent interface to supported operating systems, graphic systems and hardware components. The use of a portable run-time environment makes the source code files portable across supported platforms. LabVIEW programs are slower than equivalent compiled C code, although it is often possible to mitigate speed issues with program optimizations.

=== Large libraries ===
LabVIEW includes a large number of libraries containing functions for data acquisition, signal generation, mathematics, statistics, signal conditioning, analysis, integration, filtering, and other specialized abilities such as data capture from hardware sensors. In addition, it includes &quot;MathScript&quot;, a text-based programming component with built-in functions for signal processing, analysis, and mathematics. MathScript can be integrated with graphical programming using &quot;script nodes&quot; and uses a syntax that is generally compatible with MATLAB.

=== Parallel programming ===
LabVIEW is an inherently concurrent language, so it is very easy to program multiple tasks that are performed in parallel via multithreading, for example by drawing two or more parallel while loops and connecting them to two separate nodes. This provides a great benefit for test system automation, where it is common practice to run processes like test sequencing, data recording, and hardware interfacing in parallel.

=== Ecosystem ===
Due to the longevity and popularity of the LabVIEW platform and the ability for users to extend its functions, a large ecosystem of third-party add-ons has developed via contributions from the community. Most of these add-ons are available for direct download and installation into LabVIEW using the VI Package Manager (VIPM), the official package manager for LabVIEW add-ons. National Instruments also hosts a marketplace for both free and paid LabVIEW add-ons, called the &quot;NI Tools Network&quot;.

=== User community ===
There is a low-cost LabVIEW Student Edition aimed at educational institutions for learning purposes. There is also an active community of LabVIEW users who communicate through several electronic mailing lists (email groups) and Internet forums.

===Home Bundle Edition===
National Instruments provides a low cost LabVIEW Home Bundle Edition.

=== Community Edition ===
National Instruments provides a free-for-non-commercial use version called LabVIEW Community Edition. This version includes everything in the Professional Editions of LabVIEW, has no watermarks, and includes the LabVIEW NXG Web Module for non-commercial use. These editions may also be used by K-12 schools.

== Criticism ==
LabVIEW is a proprietary product of National Instruments. Unlike common programming languages such as C or Fortran, LabVIEW is not managed or standardized by any third-party standards committee. 

=== Non-textual ===
Since the &quot;G&quot; language is non-textual, common software tools such as versioning, side-by-side (or diff) comparison, and version code change tracking cannot be applied in the same manner as for textual programming languages. There are, however, some source code control (versioning) tools that do enable code comparison and merging, such as subversion, CVS and Perforce.

== Release history ==
In 2005, starting with LabVIEW 8.0, major versions are released around the first week of August, to coincide with the annual National Instruments conference NI Week, and followed by a bug-fix release the following February.

In 2009, National Instruments began naming releases after the year in which they are released. A bug-fix is termed a Service Pack, for example, the 2009 service pack 1 was released in February 2010.

In 2017, National Instruments moved the annual conference to May and released LabVIEW 2017 alongside a completely redesigned LabVIEW NXG 1.0 built on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
==Repositories and libraries==
OpenG and LAVA Code Repository (LAVAcr) serve as repositories for a wide range of Open Source LabVIEW applications and libraries. SourceForge has LabVIEW listed as one of the possible languages in which code can be written.

VI Package Manager has become the standard package manager for LabVIEW libraries. It is very similar in purpose to Ruby&#x27;s RubyGems and Perl&#x27;s CPAN, although it provides a graphical user interface similar to the Synaptic Package Manager. VI Package Manager provides access to a repository of the OpenG (and other) libraries for LabVIEW.

Tools exist to convert MathML into &quot;G&quot; code.

==Related software==
National Instruments also offers Measurement Studio, a product that offers many of the test, measurement, and control abilities of LabVIEW as a set of classes for use with Microsoft Visual Studio. This allows developers to harness some of LabVIEW&#x27;s strengths within the text-based .NET Framework. National Instruments also offers LabWindows/CVI as an alternative for ANSI C programmers.

When applications need sequencing, users often use LabVIEW with the National Instruments &quot;TestStand&quot; test management software.

The Ch interpreter is a C/C++ interpreter that can be embedded in LabVIEW for scripting.

DSP Robotics&#x27; FlowStone DSP also uses a form of graphical programming similar to LabVIEW but is limited to the robotics industry.

LabVIEW has a direct node with modeFRONTIER, a multidisciplinary and multi-objective optimization and design environment, written to allow coupling to almost any computer-aided engineering tool. Both can be part of the same process workflow description and can be virtually driven by the optimization technologies available in modeFRONTIER.

<text>Black Knight was a British research ballistic missile, originally developed to test and verify the design of a re-entry vehicle for the Blue Streak missile. It is the United Kingdom&#x27;s first indigenous expendable launch project.

Design work on what would become the Black Knight launch vehicle commenced in 1955, being performed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) and British manufacturer Saunders-Roe. Saunders-Roe was the principal manufacturer for the Black Knight at its facility on the Isle of Wight. On 7 September 1958, the first Black Knight was launched at Woomera in Australia. Between 1958 and 1965, a total of 22 launch vehicles were fired, none of which having suffered any major failures. After 22 launches, the Black Knight programme came to a close.

The success of the Black Knight as a cheap and successful test vehicle led to many studies being performed into further derivatives of the vehicle, including its adaption to serve as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and as a launch vehicle, including one proposal, which was based on the Blue Streak missile and the Black Knight, known as the Black Prince. Technology and experience gained on the Black Knight programme would contribute to the subsequent Black Arrow expendable launch vehicle programme.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the early 1950s, the British government had identified the need to develop its own series of ballistic missiles due to advances being made in this field, particularly by the Soviet Union and the United States. The ballistic missile was of critical importance to developing a more effective method of nuclear deterrence, replacing the role currently occupied by free-fall nuclear bombs and thus a reliance on ever-more complex, costly and capable aircraft. A British programme to develop such a missile, named Blue Streak, was promptly initiated; however, there were key questions over the then-relatively unknown scenario of what such a vehicle would encounter when attempting re-entry to the atmosphere, there were fears that such a vehicle might simply burn up like a meteor and therefore be unachievable.

To explore the phenomenon of atmospheric entry, it was decided that a dedicated research programme would be necessary in order to acquire research information that would shape the design of subsequent ballistic vehicles. Britain had also never previously developed a ballistic missile before, the field being relatively new and with few participants, thus there was significant value in developing and constructing a research ballistic missile in order to gain experience and data on how to design and build such vehicles, develop launch techniques, and general handling. Thus, in 1955, the Black Knight research vehicle has its inception for this purpose.

In 1955, due to its close relationship with the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), the British government awarded a contract to British manufacturer Saunders-Roe to produce the Black Knight. This contract involved a complete package for the design, development, manufacturing and testing of the vehicle, its flight control system, instrumentation, and supporting infrastructure for its operation.

According to author C.N Hill, the Black Knight programme ultimately fulfilled its prime objective of gathering information on rocket systems. Amongst applicable fields for the accumulated data included a greater understanding of the physics involved in re-entry vehicles, which had military value due to this scope including ballistic missiles and missile defense. Specifically, it influenced the development of the British-built Blue Streak missile programme, while generally benefitting scientific understanding in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

===Further development and derivatives===
The Black Knight was regarded as being a successful programme, having produced a relatively low cost and reliable rocket. While the Blue Streak missile had by this point been recognised as being too costly to serve as a competitive launcher in the face of international competition, the Black Knight was viewed as having the potential to be more cost-effective in this regard. The Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) had been encouraged by its performance and were keen to reuse the rocket elsewhere.

One of more radical ideas for reusing the Black Knight was voiced by Armstrong-Siddeley, who suggested that the rocket be repurposed as the foundations for an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). This proposal would have involved greatly increasing the size of the vehicle itself, and the adoption of a substantially more powerful rocket engine in place of the Gamma engine.

The RAE performed a multitude of studies on the subject of prospective derivatives of the Black Knight and its Gamma engine. Many of these focused on the possibility of extending the vehicle to operate a launcher for small satellites and proposed the use of liquid hydrogen-fuelled upper stage, which was comparatively expensive to develop while not providing much payload capacity without redesigning of the Black Knight vehicle itself as well. An alternative solution for satellite launches was explored by the RAE, in which solid fuel boosters would have been attached to the Black Knight. This proposal would have involved a basically unmodified Black Knight vehicle being paired with two strap-on boosters along with two further stages in order to be capable of placing a 100lb payload into a 200 mile-high orbit. While this implementation was found to be simple and low-cost to develop, the payload capacity remained low.
One of the more ambitious proposals for an improved Black Knight involved substantially increasing the diameter of the tank from 36 inches to 54 inches, which had the effect of nearly doubling the rocket&#x27;s fuel capacity, along with the adoption of a more powerful solid fuel second stage, named &quot;Kestrel&quot;. This envisioned more powerful Black Knight rocket was to have been used as part of a further set of planned experiments, which had been codenamed &#x27;Crusade&#x27;. Upon review, HM Treasury refused to provide any funding for further Black Knight projects, and work on an enlarged Black Knight was abandoned in favour of the larger Black Arrow satellite launcher.

==Design==
The Black Knight was a single stage ballistic missile, complete with a separate nose section. The vehicle was 35 feet long, had a 3 foot diameter, and a fully-fuelled weight of 12,800lb. In operation, the Black Knight could attain an altitude of up to 600 miles, and achieve a re-entry velocity of 12,000 feet per second.

The Black Knight was powered by the Bristol Siddeley Gamma rocket engines. The Gamma engine was designed and manufactured by Armstrong-Siddeley at their factory in Ansty, near Coventry. 
Between 1956 and 1959, the Gamma rocket engines underwent testing at the High Down Rocket Test Site under the direction of under Paul Leyton. The engine ran a fuel comprising a combination of high-test peroxide (HTP) and kerosene; Saunders-Roe possessed prior experience of working with this fuel mixture as a result of the firm&#x27;s work on the Saunders-Roe SR.53 rocket propelled interceptor aircraft.

== Versions ==
There were five Black Knight design versions, depending on the engines used on the first and second stages.
==Firings==
During 1957, the first test launch of the Black Knight rocket was performed at High Down on the Isle of Wight. In September 1958, the second test launch was performed, this being the first to use the dedicated launch facility at the Woomera Test Range, Australia; the majority of Black Knight launches were performed from Woomera, leading to the launchers being constructed in the UK and then transported to Australia.

The first two launch vehicles were used as &#x27;proving rounds&#x27; - that is, launches which lacked any payload in order to test and validate the design of the rocket itself. The third launch of the Black Knight was the first to carry an actual payload in the form of a re-entry vehicle, which was present for the purpose of testing the properties of the re-entry body&#x27;s chosen design. All the re-entry firings deliberately took place on clear moonless nights, so that the luminous wake of the re-entry body could be observed photographically.

Further firings with different heads showed up some unusual phenomena, and further tests under the code names &quot;Gaslight&quot; and &quot;Dazzle&quot; were carried out in conjunction with the United States. A variety of heads were flown in these tests, including a plain copper sphere and a silica sphere. Heads composed of a composite asbestos-based material known as Durestos were also flown, and later tests finalised on a cone-shaped head re-entering pointed-end first, as used on many subsequent missile RVs.

A total of 25 Black Knight launch vehicles were constructed at a cost of just over £40,000 each. A single rocket (BK02) was used for ground testing. One (BK11) was expended as part of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) initiative as an investigation of range facilities. The majority, 21, were fired as part of re-entry experiments; if they had been used as launch vehicles for satellites, the majority of these firing would have been successfully attained orbit. 

All launches of the Black Knight were successful and there were no major failures experienced during any. Authors Robin Paine and Roger Syms summarised this achievement as: &quot;Altogether, 22 successful launches were made without a single failure - a remarkable record without parallel in ballistics rocket development.

==Survivors==

Three Black Knight rockets were preserved and are now kept on static display in museums.

* Black Knight BK02 is on display at the Royal Museum Connect Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is nearly 11m high and stretches up for three floors.
* Black Knight BK10 is on display at the World Museum in Liverpool, England. It is suspended from the ceiling near the Planetarium, with other Black Knight components on display nearby. 
* A Black Knight (probably BK22) is on display at the Woomera Aircraft &amp; Missile Park. 

== Launches ==
Black Knight was launched twenty-two times from Woomera LA-5.

<text>The &quot;Sefer&quot; Chofetz Chaim (or Chafetz Chaim or Hafetz Hayim) (, trans. &quot;Pursuer of Life&quot;) is a book by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, who is also called &quot;the Chofetz Chaim&quot; after it. The book deals with the Jewish laws of speech.

The title of the &quot;Chafetz Chaim&quot; is taken from Psalms:
The book&#x27;s subject is &quot;Hilchoth Shmirath HaLashon&quot; (laws of clean speech). Kagan provides copious sources from the Torah, Talmud, and &quot;Rishonim&quot; about the severity of Jewish law on tale-mongering and gossip. Lashon hara, literally &quot;&#x27;the evil tongue&quot;, i.e., evil speech (or loosely gossip and slander and prohibitions of defamation), is sometimes translated as &quot;prohibitions of slander&quot;, but most commonly concerns the prohibitions of saying evil/bad/unpleasant things, whether or not they are true.
The book is divided into three parts:
* The legal text is &quot;Mekor Chayim&quot; (&quot;Source of Life&quot;).
* &quot;Be&#x27;er Mayim Chayim&quot; (&quot;Well of living water&quot;), the footnotes and legal argument.
* It is commonly printed together with the text &quot;Shemirath haLashon&quot; (&quot;Guarding of the tongue&quot;), an ethical treatise on the proper use of the faculty of speech.

==The author==

Yisrael Meir Kagan is commonly known as the &quot;Chafetz Chaim&quot;, the name of his book. He was born in Dzyatlava, Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire (today Belarus), on January 26, 1838. By 1869 his house became known as the Radin Yeshiva. Kagan published twenty-one books. His first work, &quot;Chafetz Chaim&quot; (1873), is the first attempt to organize and clarify the laws regarding &quot;Lashon Hara&quot;. Other notable works include the &quot;Sefer Shmirat HaLashon&quot;, an ethical work on the importance of guarding one&#x27;s tongue and the Mishnah Berurah (printed between 1894 and 1907) which is a commentary on the &quot;Orach Chayim&quot;, the first section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, and has been accepted among many Ashkenazi Jews as an authoritative source of Halacha.

<doc id="544737" wikidata="Q7287326" url="?curid=544737" title="Ralph Carter">
<text>Ralph David Carter (born May 30, 1961) is an American actor and singer, best remembered as Michael Evans, the youngest child of Florida and James Evans Sr., on the CBS sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; from 1974 to 1979. Before joining &quot;Good Times&quot;, Carter appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;Raisin,&quot; based on the Lorraine Hansberry drama &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, as was noted in the credits during the first season.

==Early acting career==
Carter started on Broadway at just nine years old in the musical &quot;The Me Nobody Knows&quot;. After runs in &quot;Tough To Get Help&quot;, &quot;Dude&quot; and &quot;Via Galactica&quot;, he landed his breakout role as Travis Younger in &quot;Raisin&quot;, for which he won the 1973 Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Performer as well as the 1974 Theatre World Award and a nomination for the 1974 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical.

==&quot;Good Times&quot;==
Norman Lear was enjoying huge success in the 1970s, with the hit television series &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, and &quot;Maude&quot;. Lear developed &quot;Good Times&quot; as a spin-off series for Maude&#x27;s housekeeper, Florida Evans (portrayed by Esther Rolle) and her husband Henry (John Amos), who was renamed James. Because of Carter&#x27;s success in &quot;Raisin&quot;, Lear bought out the remainder of his Broadway contract to cast him as the first original character of &quot;Good Times&quot;, James and Florida&#x27;s youngest son, Michael.

== Other work ==
In 1975, Carter recorded an album titled &quot;Young and in Love&quot;, which was released by Mercury Records, and it included a cover of the Ruby &amp; the Romantics 1964 song &quot;When You&#x27;re Young and in Love&quot;. That song would become the first single from the album. Carter performed the song on the musical variety television show &quot;Soul Train&quot;. That song, along with the second single &quot;Extra, Extra (Read All About It)&quot;, charted at No. 37 and No. 59, respectively, on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. In 1985, Carter had another single released, &quot;Get it Right&quot;, without an accompanying album, though it did not chart.

In 2005, Carter appeared in the cast of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death&quot; for the Classical Theatre of Harlem Company.
