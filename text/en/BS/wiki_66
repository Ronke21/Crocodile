<text>Glenn Hoddle (born 27 October 1957) is an English former football player and manager. He currently works as a television pundit and commentator for ITV Sport and TNT Sports.

He played as a midfielder for Tottenham Hotspur, Monaco, Chelsea and Swindon Town and at international level for England. In 2007, he was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame, which cited him as one of the most gifted and creative English footballers of his generation, exhibiting &quot;sublime balance and close control, unrivalled passing and vision and extraordinary shooting ability, both from open play and set pieces&quot;. He was also known for his tactical intelligence and work-rate.

He has been manager of Swindon Town (earning promotion to the Premier League), Chelsea (taking them to the FA Cup final), Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur (reaching a League Cup final) and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He managed England to the second round of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Argentina on penalties. He was dismissed from the England job in 1999 off the back of an interview with Matt Dickinson in which he was widely interpreted as saying that people with disabilities and others are affected by karma from past lives. He said that his words were &quot;misconstrued, misunderstood and misinterpreted&quot; and that disabled people had his &quot;overwhelming support, care, consideration and dedication&quot;.

==Early life==
Hoddle was born in 1957 in Hayes, Middlesex, to Derek Hoddle and Teresa Roberts. Soon after, the family moved to Harlow, Essex, where he attended Burnt Mill School.

He began supporting Tottenham Hotspur when he was eight, and his favourite player was Martin Chivers. He first came to the attention of Tottenham when Chivers and Ray Evans went to present prizes at a local school cup final and noticed the potential of an 11-year-old Hoddle. On Chivers&#x27;s recommendation, he was invited to train with the club at Tottenham&#x27;s practice ground in Cheshunt. At the age of 15, Hoddle played for Harlow-based Sunday league club Longmans, alongside his father.

== Playing career ==
===Tottenham Hotspur===

Hoddle joined Tottenham as a junior when he was 12, and signed for the club as an apprentice on 17 April 1974. He successfully overcame knee problems in his early teens and collected eight England Youth caps, the first of these on 18 March 1975 against Spain. He made his Spurs first-team debut as a 17-year-old substitute for Cyril Knowles against Norwich City on 30 August 1975, a game that ended 2–2. Hoddle was forced to wait until 21 February 1976 to start a First Division match and immediately announced his arrival with the winning goal.

He flourished under the management of Keith Burkinshaw and despite the club&#x27;s relegation to the Second Division in 1976–77 after 27 seasons of First Division football, a Hoddle-inspired Spurs side won promotion to the top flight at the first attempt. As Tottenham&#x27;s transitional phase continued, Hoddle&#x27;s international career began on 15 December 1976 in an Under-21 friendly fixture against Wales. He would collect another eleven caps at that level, and play twice for the England &#x27;B&#x27; team prior to scoring on his full international debut against Bulgaria on 22 November 1979.

The 1979–80 campaign heralded the emergence of Hoddle as a top-class player; the 22-year-old midfielder scored 19 goals in 41 league appearances and was awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award at the end of the season. In 1981, he starred as Spurs won the FA Cup for the sixth time, defeating Manchester City after a replay. The following season, Tottenham retained the FA Cup (Hoddle scored in both the final and final replay) against Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers and finished the League campaign in fourth place, the club&#x27;s best league position since 1971. Hoddle was part of the Tottenham team which reached the final of the League Cup, losing 3–1 to Liverpool, and the semi-final stage of the European Cup Winners Cup. During the summer of 1982, Hoddle played in two of England&#x27;s matches in the opening group phase of the FIFA World Cup, starting against Kuwait after a substitute appearance in a 2–0 victory over Czechoslovakia.

Hoddle&#x27;s involvement in the following three seasons was limited by a number of niggling injury problems (he started only 76 of a possible 126 league matches) but nevertheless, Hoddle proved to be the architect behind the team&#x27;s 1984 UEFA Cup triumph despite missing the final due to fitness concerns. In October 1983, he helped Spurs win 6–2 on aggregate against a Feyenoord Rotterdam side containing Johan Cruyff. Cruyff was dismissive of Hoddle before their first match, but after Hoddle&#x27;s performance, Cruyff swapped shirts with Hoddle as a sign of respect.

Spurs came close to further honours in the next three seasons, reaching third place in the First Division and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1984–85 and another FA Cup Final in 1987, losing 3–2 to Coventry City, the only time the North London club has experienced defeat in the final of the famous knock-out competition. The unexpected loss to the Midlands side was Hoddle&#x27;s last match for Spurs, as newly appointed AS Monaco manager Arsène Wenger brought him to the principality for a fee of £750,000. Between 1975 and 1987, Hoddle scored 110 goals in 490 first-team matches in all competitions; only four players (Steve Perryman, Pat Jennings, Gary Mabbutt and Cyril Knowles) have made more appearances in a Spurs shirt. At international level, Hoddle won 44 caps for England during his Tottenham career.

===AS Monaco===
Hoddle announced in 1987 that he would be leaving Tottenham at the end of the season to pursue a career overseas. He joined AS Monaco alongside George Weah and fellow Englishman Mark Hateley and immediately inspired the club to the 1988 Ligue 1 championship, its first league title in six seasons. Hoddle was voted the Best Foreign Player in French football and helped to guide the team to the quarter-finals of the European Cup in the 1988–89 campaign; however, a severe knee injury curtailed Hoddle&#x27;s career at the highest level, and in November 1990, the 33-year-old left the club by mutual consent, having helped to improve the standing of English footballers in foreign countries.

During his three-and-a-half-year spell in France, Hoddle won a further nine England caps, making his international farewell against the Soviet Union in June 1988. He returned to England and signed for Chelsea on a non-contract basis to regain his fitness, leaving Stamford Bridge in March 1991, without playing a senior match, to become player-manager of Swindon Town in the Second Division.

===England international career===
Hoddle made his debut alongside Kevin Reeves in England&#x27;s Euro 1980 qualifying tie against Bulgaria on 22 November 1979, scoring in a 2–0 win at Wembley. He scored in his third appearance against Australia on 31 May 1980 in a friendly in Sydney. His third goal came in his fifth appearance on 25 March 1981 in a game against Spain at Wembley, which England lost 2–1. He received his tenth cap on 27 April 1982 in the British Home Championship clash with Wales in Cardiff, which England won 1–0. By this stage of his international career, he had scored four goals.

He was included in the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup squads, and England reached the quarter-finals against Argentina in the latter.

Hoddle also featured prominently in the European Championship squads of 1980 and 1988, making his 53rd and final international appearance in the final group game of Euro 88, a 3–1 defeat to the Soviet Union in West Germany. He scored eight goals for the England senior side in a career stretching nine years, the last of his international goals coming on 23 April 1986 in a 2–1 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley.

==Managerial career==

===Swindon Town===
When Hoddle arrived at Swindon in March 1991, the club was struggling in the aftermath of a financial scandal which had seen them stripped of promotion to the First Division at the end of the previous season, a controversy which had negatively impacted the team&#x27;s league form as they had been forced to sell several key players, including midfielder Alan McLoughlin.

Hoddle prevented Swindon from slipping into the Third Division and further improvement throughout the 1991–92 season saw the Wiltshire club finish in eighth place, just missing out on a play-off place. They had briefly led the table in October.

Swindon reached the playoffs of the rebranded Division One in 1993 and beat Leicester City 4–3 at Wembley, and were then promoted to the Premier League. Hoddle scored Swindon&#x27;s first goal of the final.

By the time he guided Swindon to promotion, Hoddle was already being linked with managerial vacancies at bigger clubs. Just days after guiding Swindon to promotion, he accepted the offer to manage Chelsea and was succeeded at Swindon by his assistant John Gorman, who had been widely expected to follow him to Stamford Bridge.

===Chelsea===
In June 1993, Hoddle became player-manager of Chelsea. His assistant at Chelsea was the former Tottenham manager Peter Shreeves, and they reached the FA Cup final in Hoddle&#x27;s first season, losing 4–0 to Manchester United. But United had done the double, and consolation for their failure to win the trophy came in the form of a European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup place, Chelsea&#x27;s first European campaign for more than 20 years. Chelsea finished 14th in the league that season.

Chelsea reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; competition in 1994–95 and lost by a single goal to Real Zaragoza, who went on to beat Arsenal in the final. Hoddle guided Chelsea to the FA Cup semi-finals in 1995–96, but was unable to take them beyond 11th place in the Premiership; they had occupied this final position three times in four years. He did establish them as a force in cup competitions and made them capable of attracting top-class players—such as Ruud Gullit—to the club. Other notable signings were Mark Hughes, Dan Petrescu, Gavin Peacock, David Rocastle and Mark Stein.

===England===
Hoddle&#x27;s three-year reign at Chelsea came to an end in the summer of 1996, after he had accepted the offer to manage the England national football team in place of Terry Venables after England&#x27;s Euro 96 campaign, in which they had finished as semi-finalists as the host nation. He guided England to qualification for the 1998 World Cup, securing the team&#x27;s automatic qualification with a goalless draw in Rome against Italy. He later caused controversy by omitting Paul Gascoigne from the squad and installing supposed faith healer Eileen Drewery as part of the England coaching staff, which led to the team being dubbed &quot;The Hod Squad&quot;. They reached the second round of the 1998 tournament, losing on penalties to Argentina. Hoddle came under criticism at the start of the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, leading to speculation that he would be sacked – particularly if England failed to qualify.

Hoddle&#x27;s 60% win rate during his spell as manager is only bettered by Sir Alf Ramsey and Fabio Capello and Sam Allardyce (the last of whom managed only one game).

====Dismissal from England job====

On 30 January 1999, with the England team preparing for Euro 2000, and amidst the fall-out from the previous season&#x27;s World Cup, Hoddle gave an interview to Matt Dickinson of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in an attempt to defend himself against his critics (over issues such as Eileen Drewery and his ideology.) and show a strong front for the remainder of the qualifiers.

Dickinson&#x27;s interview reported that Hoddle had a &quot;controversial belief that the disabled, and others, are being punished for sins in a former life&quot;. Hoddle&#x27;s comments were criticised by several politicians, including Sports Minister Tony Banks and Prime Minister Tony Blair. Public opinion, based upon the immediate media furore, resulted in (according to one BBC poll) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as England manager. The BBC survey showed that many considered his comments insensitive to disabled people, but others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to sack him would constitute religious discrimination.

Hoddle said that he was unwilling to resign. He stated his words were misinterpreted and pointed out his contributions and commitment to organisations helping disabled people. The Football Association terminated Hoddle&#x27;s contract on 2 February 1999, which was welcomed by representatives of disabled groups. The disabled rights campaigner Lord Ashley, while criticising Hoddle&#x27;s views, defended his right to express them, likening the campaign against Hoddle to a &quot;witchhunt&quot;, and considered Hoddle&#x27;s dismissal &quot;a sad day for British tolerance and freedom of speech&quot;. Some writers considered the remarks were used as a pretext to get rid of him, speculating that under most circumstances Hoddle would likely have merely been reprimanded, but that the combination of the remarks, poor recent results, and rumoured discontent among the players was enough to cause the Football Association to terminate his contract. Hoddle apologised for the offence that had been caused, stating it had never been his intention and continued to fundraise for disabled groups after being dismissed.

===Southampton===
Hoddle was back in football within a year as Southampton manager, succeeding Dave Jones, who had been suspended to concentrate on clearing his name in connection with child abuse charges. Although these allegations were later found to be false, Jones was not reinstated and Hoddle continued as Southampton&#x27;s manager, having arrived on the South Coast in January 2000. Hoddle kept the Saints in the Premier League with a 15th-place finish, but left in March 2001 to return to Tottenham as manager.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Hoddle was reappointed manager of Tottenham in March 2001, with John Gorman as his assistant, following the sacking of George Graham. His first match in charge was the FA Cup semi-final against north London rivals Arsenal which Spurs lost 2–1. The following year, Tottenham reached the League Cup final in February 2002; after winning 5–1 against Hoddle&#x27;s former club Chelsea in the semi-final second leg, Spurs were the favourites but they lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers. The club&#x27;s promising early season form (which saw Hoddle voted Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2001) dwindled away and they finished ninth in the Premiership.

Spurs began the 2002–03 season with Hoddle being named Premiership Manager of the Month for August 2002 after they ended the month top of the league. They finished tenth at the end of the season. The pressure began to build up on Hoddle, and he was sacked in September 2003 after a slow start to the season, in which the team picked up four points from their opening six league games. His final game in charge was a 3–1 loss to his former side Southampton.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Hoddle was linked with a return to Southampton in March 2004, but opposition from supporters meant chairman Rupert Lowe pursued alternative targets and ultimately selected Paul Sturrock instead. Hoddle instead returned to management on 7 December 2004 with Wolverhampton Wanderers, again succeeding Dave Jones. Wolves lost only one of their remaining 25 games but failed to reach the play-offs because 15 of those games had been draws. In the 2005–06 season, with the club drawing 19 of their 46 league games. Wolves finished seventh, eight points off the playoffs. Some Wolves fans turned against Hoddle and there were chants against him during the last home game of the season against Watford. The board kept faith with Hoddle, but he stepped down on 1 July 2006, stating differing expectations between himself and the club as the reason for his departure.

===Football academy===
By January 2008, Hoddle was attempting to raise the capital to form the Glenn Hoddle Academy, based in Spain. The aim of the academy is to give another chance to young players released by football clubs in England to become professional players. Ikechi Anya was his first player at the academy to get a professional contract at a club, with Sevilla Atlético.

In June 2011, it was announced that The Glenn Hoddle Academy had linked up with English Conference North side Hyde. The Academy had previously enjoyed a link with the Spanish fourth-tier side Jerez Industrial, providing their entire squad and coaches, but fell out in a dispute over cash.

===Management offers===
Hoddle said in December 2013 that he been offered a chance to return to management 26 times in seven years, but commented that he would not return to management until his academy was able to run itself. In April 2014, he said he had come close to taking over from André Villas-Boas at Tottenham, before the job was given to Tim Sherwood. &quot;I did have talks with Daniel Levy and the club,&quot; Hoddle said. &quot;He wanted a little bit of advice and a bit of a sounding board for himself. [I said] &#x27;I am there for you if you want me to take it to the end of the season and then we will have a little look at it then, I would be prepared to do that&#x27;. I wouldn&#x27;t do it for any other club for that short period of time. It was just that it is in my DNA. I have loved my time at other clubs, I really have, but being a Spurs supporter since I was eight, going there very young, it is in my blood.&quot;

In August 2014, Hoddle was appointed first-team coach at Queens Park Rangers under Harry Redknapp; however, on 3 February 2015, Redknapp resigned, following which Hoddle also left the club.

In June 2016, after England&#x27;s 2–1 loss to Iceland at Euro 2016 and manager Roy Hodgson&#x27;s subsequent resignation, Harry Redknapp and Alan Shearer both put forward Hoddle as a candidate for the job before Sam Allardyce was appointed.

==Media career==
Hoddle has done punditry work since his retirement from coaching. He has worked for ESPN, ITV Sport and BT Sport. He began working with ESPN during Euro 2012 as a pundit. Since then, he has worked with ITV for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. He also does punditry and co-commentary for BT Sport on their telecasts of the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League.

==Singing career==
In May 1987, Hoddle released the pop single &quot;Diamond Lights&#x27;&quot;, which reached number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. It was a duet with his Spurs and England teammate Chris Waddle.

In 2021, Hoddle appeared as a contestant on the second series of the British version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, masked as the Grandfather Clock. He finished in ninth place.

==Personal life and health==
In 1986, while on holiday in Israel, Hoddle said that he had an experience which led him to become a born-again Christian.

Hoddle has been married twice, firstly to Christine Ann Stirling (1979–1998) and subsequently to Vanessa Colburn (2000–2015). He has three children with his first wife. Hoddle&#x27;s uncle, Dave, was part of the Stansted team that won the 1984 FA Vase.

In 1996, his younger brother, former footballer Carl Hoddle, overdosed on paracetamol, but recovered. In March 2008, Carl died at the age of 40 after collapsing suddenly from a brain aneurysm.

On 27 October 2018, his 61st birthday, Hoddle suffered a cardiac arrest in a London TV studio and was taken to hospital for emergency heart surgery. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that he had been close to death and was saved by the actions of an employee at BT Sport, Simon Daniels, who knew how to use a defibrillator. On 23 November 2018, Hoddle left St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital to recuperate at home after his hospital treatment.

Hoddle published his autobiography, &quot;Playmaker&quot;, in 2021.

<text>Karri Kathleen Turner (born December 21, 1966) is an American television actress who is best known for playing Lieutenant Harriet Sims in the television series &quot;JAG&quot; (1997–2005).

==Biography==

Turner was born in Fort Worth, Texas and raised in Bentonville, Arkansas. She originally considered a Drama/Tele/Film degree at Oklahoma&#x27;s Oral Roberts University before committing entirely to acting and moving to southern California to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. At one time, she was a member of The Groundlings, a California improvisational comedy troupe.

Her recent film credits include &quot;Get Smart&quot; and &quot;An American Carol&quot;. She has had extensive stage experience in such plays as &quot;Godspell&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, and appeared in 2003 as Susan in the award-winning comic short &quot;The Date&quot;. She has also had recurring roles in &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;.

She accompanied comedians Kathy Griffin and Michael McDonald to Iraq to perform for troops serving for the United States stationed there, a performance broadcast as part of Griffin&#x27;s series &quot;My Life on the D-List&quot; and has completed 13 USO tours as of 2012, as well as work for other groups such as the young challenge program Nation Guard, &quot;American Freedom Foundation&quot; and five tours with &quot;Stars for Stripes&quot;.

In January 2020 it was revealed that Turner would return to her acting career with an appearance in the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;In the Wind&quot;, as &quot;Micki Kaydar&quot;.

<text>Latymer is an uncommon English surname. It is an Anglo-Norman &quot;surname of office&quot; derived from &quot;latinier&quot;, or &quot;latimer&quot;, a speaker or writer of Latin, and since in Middle English &quot;leden&quot; meant &quot;language&quot;, an interpreter. This occupation existed in medieval Europe when Latin was the common language of science, literature, law, and administration and thus the vehicle of records and transcripts.

From the Anglo-Norman, Latymer had the meanings one who forges new ideas, who is well-schooled and wise, an envoy and interpreter. Related names include Latimer, Lattemore and Lattimore.

Notable people with the name include:

* Edward Latymer (1557–1627), wealthy merchant and official in London
* William Latymer (1499–1583), English evangelical clergyman, Dean of Peterborough
* Baron Latymer (c. 1452–1502), 
** Crispin Money-Coutts, 9th Baron Latymer (born 1955)
** Francis Money-Coutts, 5th Baron Latymer (1852–1923), British poet

<text>The American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) is the oldest intercollegiate parliamentary debating association in the United States. APDA sponsors over 50 tournaments a year, all in a parliamentary format, as well as a national championship in late April. It also administers the North American Debating Championship with the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate (CUSID) every year in January. Although it is mainly funded by its member universities, APDA is an entirely student-run organization.

==Organizational structure==
APDA comprises about 80 universities, mainly in the Northeastern United States, ranging as far north as Maine and as far south as North Carolina. APDA includes both private and public colleges and universities.

APDA members stage weekly debating tournaments, each at a different university and occurring throughout the academic year. Most weekends have two or three debating tournaments: at least one will be north of New York City and south of New York City, in order to shorten transport time. However, centrally located tournaments or historically large tournaments, such as Princeton, Rutgers, and Harvard, will be “unopposed”, meaning that they will be the only tournament on that particular weekend. Individual schools must ensure that their tournaments meet a broad set of APDA guidelines, but are free to tinker with their tournament formats.

There are a number of tournaments in which APDA plays a direct role. Most prominently, APDA sponsors a national championship at the end of each year. Unlike all other tournaments, debating at Nationals is limited to one team per university, plus any additional teams who “qualified” for Nationals during that debate season. There are several ways to qualify for Nationals: The most common through the 2006–2007 season was to reach the final round of a tournament. Starting with the 2007–2008 season, qualification was earned through year-long performance, gauged by how far debaters advance at tournaments of varying sizes.

In addition, APDA sponsors a novice tournament at the beginning of the season, a pro-am tournament once per semester, and the North American Debating Championships, which are held every other year in the United States and include top teams from the United States and Canada.

APDA also has a ranking system which combines the results of all of the year&#x27;s tournaments. Both individual speakers and two-member teams can earn points based on the results of the tournament; these points also scale up depending on the tournament&#x27;s size. At the end of the debate season, APDA gives awards to the top ten teams, speakers, and novices of the year.

APDA is an entirely student-run organization. The APDA board members are students from various host institutions, and most of the tournaments are completely organized by the host school&#x27;s debate team. Some teams do have professional coaches, but these are usually recently retired debaters who wish to stay involved with the circuit.

==Tournaments==
Weekly debating tournaments are the core of APDA. While numerous schools slightly alter the tournament format, the general format is fairly constant. Tournaments usually start on Friday afternoon and end on Saturday evening. Five preliminary rounds are held, three on Friday and two on Saturday. The first round is randomly paired, while remaining rounds are bracketed, meaning that teams with the same record face each other. Preliminary rounds generally have only one judge, most frequently a debater from the host school. After five rounds, the “break” is announced, consisting of the top eight teams at the tournament. These teams compete in single-elimination quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, judged by progressively larger panels of judges, and a tournament winner is crowned. Separate semifinals and then finals are held on the basis of the previous five rounds for the top novice team. Trophies are awarded to the top speakers, top teams, and top novice (first-year) debaters. Certain tournaments tinker with the format, having more or fewer preliminary rounds and larger or smaller breaks; the national championships, for instance, generally have one additional preliminary round and one additional elimination round.

==Format==
Debates at APDA tournaments follow a debating style known as American Parliamentary Debate, which is modeled loosely on the procedure and decorum of the UK Parliament. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge.

===Flow of the round===
A round of debate features two teams of two debaters each: the &quot;Government&quot; team, including the &quot;Prime Minister&quot; and the &quot;Member of Government&quot;, and the &quot;Opposition&quot; team, including the &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; and the &quot;Member of the Opposition&quot;.

Six speeches in all are delivered, varying in length:
* Prime Minister&#x27;s Constructive: 7 minutes, 30 seconds
* Leader of the Opposition&#x27;s Constructive: 8 minutes, 30 seconds
* Member of Government: 8 minutes, 30 seconds
* Member of the Opposition: 8 minutes, 30 seconds
* Leader of the Opposition&#x27;s Rebuttal: 4 minutes, 30 seconds
* Prime Minister&#x27;s Rebuttal: 5 minutes, 30 seconds

===Points of information===
A debater may rise to ask a &quot;point of information&quot; (POI) of an opponent during the opponent&#x27;s speech. POIs are only permitted during the first four speeches, though prohibited in the first and final minutes of each speech. The speaking debater can choose to hear the POI or to dismiss it politely. Traditionally when standing on a point of information some debaters extend one hand palm up, holding the back of the head with the other. This pose originated in old British Parliamentary etiquette: an MP would adopt the position to secure his wig and show that he was not carrying a weapon.
It is generally considered good form to accept at least one POI during a speech.

===Resolutions===
In most rounds, there is no resolution, and the Government team may propose whatever case it wishes consistent with the standards below. Certain tournaments provide both teams with a motion to which the case must conform 15 minutes before the round starts.

Since the Opposition team arrives at the round with no prior knowledge of the case, some kinds of resolutions are not permitted to ensure a fair debate. If Opposition feels that the round fits any one of these categories, they may point this out during the Leader&#x27;s speech. If the judge agrees, Opposition wins. There are five kinds of disallowed resolutions:
* &quot;tight&quot; resolutions, which are deemed too one-sided (“racism is bad”, for example);
* truisms (“Joe Biden was the greatest Democratic president of the U.S. since Barack Obama”);
* tautologies (“Good citizens should help the poor,” with goodness defined as &quot;a willingness to do charitable acts&quot;);
* status quo resolutions (“The United States should have jury trials”);
* &quot;specific-knowledge&quot; cases, i.e., cases which are unfair toward the Opposition team because they require highly obscure knowledge to oppose effectively (&quot;NASA should replace the current sealant used on the space shuttle with hypoxynucleotide-C4598&quot;)

Aside from these five limitations, virtually any topic for debate is fair game, as long as there are two coherent and debatable sides. Debaters may also present &quot;opp-choice&quot; cases, in which the government team offers the opposition team the chance to choose which side of a topic the government team will defend in the round.

===Adjudication===
A judge listens to the round and provides quantitative and qualitative assessments of the round as a whole and of the individual speakers. Some rounds use a panel of judges. Judges are usually debaters themselves, but non-debater judges, or &quot;lay judges&quot;, are sometimes used.

===Comparison to other styles===
The APDA style is generally seen as occupying a middle ground between the styles of
CUSID and NPDA. It is somewhat more rule-oriented and structured than the CUSID style, as point-by-point argumentation and careful structure are considered very important. It also emphasizes detailed analysis and de-emphasizes oratory as compared to CUSID. However, APDA style is less structured and theoretical than the NPDA style, and demands less use of technical debate formalisms.

==Types of cases==
APDA&#x27;s format allows for an enormous variety of cases. This list is &quot;not&quot; comprehensive, but should be treated as a general sketch of the case climate.

===Public policy===
Cases about public policy are among the most common cases on APDA. They include common public policy debates (school vouchers, term limits, euthanasia, capital punishment, race-based affirmative action) as well as more unconventional ideas (mandatory organ donation, proxy voting for children, private criminal prosecution, and innumerable others). Libertarian policy proposals, such as abolishing the minimum wage or abolishing paternalistic laws, are particularly popular. Cases involving the policies of particular organizations are popular as well, such as debates surrounding university speech codes. Additionally, broad social questions can be discussed without centering the case around a government actor; “Are trade unions, all things considered, a good thing for society?” is a perfectly acceptable opp-choice debate case.

===Political theory===
Abstract questions about political philosophy are also popular topics of debate.
Cases about the relative benefits of the Rawlsian “veil of ignorance” versus the Hobbesian “state of nature”, for instance, are commonplace. These rounds will generally be folded into moral hypotheticals; for instance, rather than a team actually proposing that the veil of ignorance is a worthwhile political theory, a team might argue that economic human rights should be included in constitutions, and use the veil of ignorance as a justification.

===Law and legal theory===
All aspects of law are fair game on APDA, including constitutional law (e.g. whether a Supreme Court case was wrongly decided), procedural law (e.g. whether standards of proof should differ for criminal and civil law) and abstract legal theory (e.g. whether retributive justice is a moral justification for the criminal justice system).

===Foreign policy===
Many aspects of American and international foreign policy make for excellent debate rounds. Various aspects of policy related to Iraq, Israel, North Korea, and Cuba are frequent debate topics.

===Moral hypotheticals===
Hypothetical moral dilemmas are popular topics for debate, given that they can be discussed with a minimum of specific knowledge and a maximum of argumentation. They can range from completely fantastical situations (“If you had definitive proof that one particular religion was the true religion, should you reveal it to society?”) to unlikely occurrences (“Should you kill one person to save five other people?”) to dilemmas we face every day (“You see a homeless person on the street, should you give him money you have in your pocket?”) The infinite number of hypothetical situations that can give rise to moral dilemmas make many moral hypothetical cases unique.

=== Abstract philosophy ===
Although somewhat less common than tangible moral hypotheticals, all aspects of philosophy make their way into debate rounds. Ethics is probably the most debated field of philosophy, including both abstract metaethics and modern ethical problems like the trolley problem. However, philosophy of religion (“Is it rational to be an atheist?”), philosophy of mind (“Can a computer have mental states?”) and even philosophy of language (“Does love result from appreciation of someone’s properties, or does appreciation of someone’s properties result from love?”) can result in excellent rounds.

=== Time-space ===
One type of case, common on APDA but rare on other circuits, is the time-space case. This places the speaker in the position of some real-life, fictional, or historical figure. Only information accessible to a person in that position is legal in this type of round. For instance, “You are Socrates. Don’t commit suicide” could not reference events that took place after Socrates’ death. The speaker can be a fictional character (“You are Homer Simpson. Do not sell your soul”), a historical character (“You are Abraham Lincoln. Do not sign the emancipation proclamation”) or virtually any other sentient individual.

One notable type of time-space case is the historical hypothetical case, in which decisions made by particular historical figures are debated from their historical context. Debates surrounding, for instance, Civil War strategy or World War I alliances are commonplace. These types of debates often require a detailed knowledge of history.

Time-space cases are a particularly sensitive type of case for the government, because their setting must leave room for the opposition to defeat the case even if that would go against the historical outcome already known to everyone in the room.

== History ==
While parliamentary debate had been popular in America for some time, there was no proper organization that existed to schedule tournaments, officiate a national championship or resolve disputes. The result was a bizarrely ordered chaos. Following the Glasgow World Championship in 1981, APDA was founded. It has dramatically grown in size since then. It became an incorporated organization in 2000.

=== Presidents ===
The President is the leader of the Executive Board of APDA, presiding over the Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Finance, and three Members-at-Large. They also serve as the American representative for WUDC. Candidates from various member schools typically declare in the middle of February. Elections are typically held on the final weekend of March annually to elect the Executive Board for the following academic year.

=== Bo Missonis Award ===
This award is given to rising fourth-year debaters who, in the opinion of its prior recipient(s), best represent(s) Bo Missonis. This symbolizes a zest for debate for its own sake accompanied by a certain individuality or style, and in promoting a kind environment for the league. It is awarded to rising seniors so that it may be awarded each year. It is named after Robert &quot;Bo&quot; Missonis.

=== Chris Porcaro Award ===
This award is given to the fourth-year debater with the most top speaker finishes in their APDA career. It is named after Chris Porcaro, the 1998 APDA speaker of the year, who died of cancer in 2000.
===APDA Speakers of the Year===
The APDA Speaker of the Year award is presented to the top-ranked individual speaker over the course of the academic year.
=== Jeff Williams Award ===
Created in 2007, the Jeff Williams award is presented to the fourth-year debater who, in the course of their APDA career, has earned the most finishes in the top ten of any OTY category.

===Kyle Bean Award===
Created in 2016, the Kyle Bean award is presented to the debater or debaters who best embodies the qualities of Kyle Bean, a former Harvard debater who died earlier that season. Those qualities included being welcoming to new debaters, using debate to explore interesting topics, and enjoying debate in a way that makes the activity more fun for everyone else. The award is agnostic to the competitive success of the debater, and instead acknowledges individuals for positive personal contributions to the debate community.

=== Distinguished Service Award ===
The Distinguished Service Award (DSA) is awarded in order to recognize and honor individuals who have delivered outstanding contributions to APDA, parliamentary debate, or the facilitation of public discourse. These contributions may be of any nature, but must be characterized by devotion to APDA and/or its ideals above and beyond that expected of an individual in the position of the honoree.

<text>604 is the debut studio album by English electronic music band Ladytron, released in the United States on 6 February 2001 by Emperor Norton Records and in the United Kingdom on 12 March 2001 by Invicta Hi-Fi. It was co-produced, engineered and mixed by Lance Thomas. Some of the tracks had been previously released on their EPs &quot;Miss Black and Her Friends&quot; (1999), &quot;Mu-Tron EP&quot; (2000) and &quot;Commodore Rock&quot; (2000).

On 20 July 2004, &quot;604&quot; was reissued in the US with four bonus tracks, the first three being live recordings made on 16 May 2003 at the Central Military Club in Sofia, Bulgaria. The January 2011 re-release of the album on Nettwerk also features these same bonus tracks.

In a 2002 interview with online magazine Chaos Control, Daniel Hunt stated that the album was named after the area code for British Columbia. Reuben Wu drew the cover of the European edition of &quot;604&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;604&quot; received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 11 reviews, which indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In March 2001, &quot;604&quot; was selected as Album of the Month by &quot;Muzik&quot; magazine.

As of July 2002, the album had sold 20,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Singles==
&quot;He Took Her to a Movie&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single. The song was recorded for £50, and features guest vocals from Lisa Eriksson of San Francisco-based electronic duo Techno Squirrels. Upon its release, it was named the &quot;Single of the Week&quot; by &quot;NME&quot; magazine. The track was inspired by Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;The Model&quot;.

&quot;Playgirl&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. It peaked at number 89 on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;The Way That I Found You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third and final single. It reached number 88 on the UK Singles Chart. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Holiday 601&quot;, was included on Ladytron&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Light &amp; Magic&quot;, retitled &quot;NuHorizons&quot;.

<text>Venetia Katharine Douglas Burney (married name Phair, 11 July 1918 – 30 April 2009) was an English accountant and teacher. She is remembered as the first person to suggest the name Pluto for the dwarf planet discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. At the time, she was 11 years old.

==Biography==
Venetia Burney was the daughter of Rev. Charles Fox Burney, Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at Oxford, and his wife Ethel Wordsworth Burney (née Madan). She was the granddaughter of Falconer Madan (1851–1935), Librarian of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. Falconer Madan&#x27;s brother, Henry Madan (1838–1901), Science Master of Eton, had in 1878 suggested the names Phobos and Deimos for the moons of Mars.

On 14 March 1930, Falconer Madan read the story of the new planet&#x27;s discovery in &quot;The Times&quot; and mentioned it to his granddaughter Venetia. She suggested the name Pluto – the Roman god of the Underworld, who was able to make himself invisible − and Madan forwarded the suggestion to astronomer Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled his American colleagues at Lowell Observatory. Clyde Tombaugh liked the proposal because it started with the initials of Percival Lowell, who had predicted the existence of Planet X, which they thought was Pluto because it was coincidentally in that position in space. On 1 May 1930, the name Pluto was formally adopted for the new celestial body. Whether she was really the first person to propose the name has been doubted on plausibility grounds, but the historical fact is that she was credited as such.

Most news coverage done at the time of the discovery of Pluto didn&#x27;t mention her and the role she played in terms of naming Pluto was mostly forgotten about until a 1984 article from &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; publicized her role.

Burney was educated at Downe House School in Berkshire and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied economics from 1938-41. After graduation she became a chartered accountant. Later she became a teacher of economics and mathematics at girls’ schools in southwest London teaching until she retired in the 1980s. She was married to Edward Maxwell Phair from 1947 until his death in 2006. Her husband, a classicist, later became housemaster and head of English at Epsom College. She died on 30 April 2009, aged 90, in Banstead in Surrey. She was buried at Randalls Park Crematorium in Leatherhead in Surrey.

Only a few months before the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, with a debate going on about the issue, she said in an interview, &quot;At my age, I&#x27;ve been largely indifferent [to the debate]; though I suppose I would prefer it to remain a planet.&quot;

==Legacy==
The asteroid 6235 Burney and the Burney impact basin on Pluto were named in her honour. In July 2015 the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft was the first to visit Pluto and carried an instrument named Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter in her honour. Mihaly Horanyi, Principal Investigator for the instrument, and Alan Stern visited Mrs Phair at home to present her with a plaque, certificate, and spacecraft model.

Massachusetts rock band The Venetia Fair came up with their name after reading about Venetia Phair, shortly after Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.

<text>Christopher Graham Collins (born 28 January 1957), known professionally as Frank Skinner, is an English comedian, actor, presenter and writer. At the 2001 British Comedy Awards, he was named Best Comedy Entertainment Personality. His television work includes &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot; from 1994 to 2004, &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot; from 1995 to 2005, &quot;Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned&quot; from 2000 to 2005, and &quot;Room 101&quot; from 2012 to 2018. From 2009 to 2024 he hosted &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot; on Absolute Radio, broadcast live on Saturday mornings and released as a podcast. In October 2024 Skinner launched the &quot;Frank Off The Radio&quot; podcast, with the same crew as the radio show.

Along with David Baddiel, he provided vocals and wrote the lyrics for &quot;Three Lions&quot;, the official song in collaboration with Liverpudlian indie band the Lightning Seeds, to mark the England national football team&#x27;s participation in the 1996 European Championship (which was hosted in England); he also reprised his role to release two subsequent versions of the song for the England team&#x27;s involvement in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2010 World Cup. The 1996 version is the only song ever to have four separate stints at number one in the UK singles chart with the same artists, the most recent coming in July 2018 following England reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup.

==Early life==
Skinner was born on 28 January 1957 in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, and grew up in a council house in neighbouring Oldbury. He was the youngest of four children born to John Collins (1918–1990) and his wife Doris (1919–1989).

Skinner wrote in his autobiography that his father, who was born in West Cornforth, County Durham, played for Spennymoor United before the Second World War, and met his mother in a local pub after Spennymoor had played West Bromwich Albion in an FA Cup game in 1937. Club officials and historians could not find his father in their records.

Skinner attended Moat Farm Infant School from 1961 to 1964, St Hubert&#x27;s Roman Catholic Junior School from 1964 to 1968, and then Oldbury Technical Secondary School from 1968 to 1973. He passed two O-levels in summer 1973 and took A-levels in English language and art, along with several O-level resits, at Oldbury Technical School Sixth Form. He subsequently took four A-levels (including English language and literature) at Warley College of Technology and graduated from Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University) in 1981 with a degree in English. This was followed by a master&#x27;s degree in English literature at the University of Warwick in Coventry the following year.

Despite his given first name of Christopher, his parents called him by his middle name Graham; all his friends referred to him, and some still do, as Chris. Skinner once explained that whenever someone called at his house to ask if &quot;Chris&quot; was there, his mother would say yes, only to then turn around and shout for &quot;Graham&quot;. He adopted the stage name Frank Skinner when the actors&#x27; union Equity told him there was already a singer from Burnley on their books called Chris Collins. He took the name from a member of his late father&#x27;s dominoes team.

==Career==
After graduating, Skinner spent three-and-a-half years on unemployment benefit before finding work as a lecturer in English at Halesowen College. In 1987, he decided to give stand-up comedy a try on the side. Skinner performed his first stand-up gig in 1987 and made his television debut a year later. In 1990, he co-wrote and starred in the comedy variety show &quot;Packet of Three&quot; on Channel 4 but continued to see his reputation as a stand-up grow. Before becoming a full-time performer in 1989, he suffered a bout of influenza in September 1986 that made him give up drinking, and he remains a high-profile recovering alcoholic.

Skinner won the 1991 Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, beating Jack Dee and Eddie Izzard. He has worked with David Baddiel, notably on the popular late-night entertainment show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot; from 1994 to 2004 and on &quot;Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned&quot; from 2000 to 2005. The duo also co-wrote and performed the football song &quot;Three Lions&quot; with the Lightning Seeds and the England national football team for Euro 1996, and re-recorded it for the 1998 World Cup. The song reached #1 in the UK charts both times. In 2001, he released his autobiography &quot;Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner&quot;, which became a bestseller. The accompanying TV show, &quot;Frank Skinner on Frank Skinner&quot;, in which Skinner showed where he lived as a child and interviews with Skinner, his friends and family members, was recorded and shown on ITV in 2001. In July 2018, &quot;Three Lions&quot; re-entered the charts at number 1. Fans were celebrating the progress of England at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s coming home&quot; featuring heavily on social media and television.

In 1998, Skinner took part in a documentary titled &quot;A Little Bit of Elvis&quot;. He paid over £11,000 at auction for a shirt which he believed was worn by Elvis Presley at his famous 1956 Tupelo concert. Skinner visited the US to find out if the shirt was the genuine article. After a slightly awkward conversation with Dave Hebler, Presley&#x27;s bodyguard, it appeared the shirt did once belong to Presley, but it was not worn at the concert. Skinner is a lifelong fan of Elvis and used to buy the &quot;Elvis Monthly&quot; magazine.

From 1995 to 1998, Skinner had his own chat show on BBC One, which ended when the BBC refused to meet pay demands of a reported £20 million. After a short break, the show found a new home at ITV in 1999, where it ran until late 2005. He has appeared in a number of self-written sitcoms, including &quot;Blue Heaven&quot; (1994) and &quot;Shane&quot; (2004).

In 2000, Skinner appeared as Buttons in the ITV Panto adaptation of Cinderella. In 2003, he was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2005, Skinner announced he was going to leave behind his television work in favour of returning to the stand-up comedy circuit. A second series of &quot;Shane&quot; had been made, but never shown.

In February 2006, Skinner received an honorary degree from the University of Central England (now Birmingham City University). Skinner and David Baddiel covered the 2006 FIFA World Cup by podcast for &quot;The Times&quot;. The podcasts received a nomination for the 2007 Sony Radio Academy Awards.

In 2007, Skinner performed a new live stand-up tour, his first for 10 years, starting at a warm-up gig at the Swindon Arts Centre, continuing through to the Edinburgh Festival for 2 weeks at The Pleasance, the venue where he won the Perrier Award, and a 69 date national tour including three sold-out homecoming performances at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham in the autumn.

In November 2008, after senior broadcasting figures such as ITV chairman Michael Grade and presenter Terry Wogan called for TV to reduce its use of vulgar language, Skinner decided to experiment with removing swear words altogether from his stand-up live act, although he said it would be a shame if &#x27;clever swearing&#x27; was lost. He also stood in for an ill Paul Merton as a team captain on 21 November edition of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

From March 2009, Skinner started to present the Saturday Morning Breakfast Show on Absolute Radio with his co-hosts Emily Dean and Gareth Richards. The show is produced by Avalon Television. After an initial 12-week stint proved very popular with the listeners, Skinner&#x27;s contract was extended until summer 2010. 
Skinner plays the banjo ukulele and in 2010, he contributed ukulele parts to a song by Fairport Convention called &quot;Ukulele Central&quot; which featured on their album &quot;Festival Bell&quot;. A great admirer of George Formby, he hosted a BBC Four TV documentary, &quot;Frank Skinner on George Formby&quot;, which aired on 27 October 2011.

In 2011, Skinner wrote and performed a Radio 4 comedy series, &quot;Don&#x27;t Start&quot;, with Katherine Parkinson. Each episode was based on an argument between Skinner&#x27;s character Neil and Neil&#x27;s girlfriend Kim. Skinner said each episode was only 15 minutes as it was &quot;too intense&quot; to be any longer. &quot;Don&#x27;t Start&quot; returned for a second series in 2012, and aired its third and final series in 2015-2016.
From 2012 to 2018, Skinner was the host of BBC show &quot;Room 101&quot;. In August 2013, he was a team captain on the BBC comedy show &quot;I Love My Country&quot;.

A longtime fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Skinner appeared alongside Peter Capaldi&#x27;s Doctor in the 2014 episode &quot;Mummy on the Orient Express&quot;. He subsequently featured in the 2019 Big Finish Productions audio release &quot;The Sinestran Kill&quot;, the first episode of &quot;Doctor Who: The Fourth Doctor Adventures, Season 8&quot;.

In 2015, Skinner appeared in the inaugural season of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;. In an interview with Greg Davies and Alex Horne, Davies said that as the show was untried, there were some concerns about whether contestants &quot;were going to be made fools of.&quot; Horne said that since the show was unscripted and contestants would just have to trust them, &quot;that was a big step&quot; of faith for people to make. Horne went on to say that Skinner&#x27;s agreeing to be on the show was &quot;a big moment&quot;. Skinner performed moderately well on the show, and ended up tying for second place.

In 2020 Skinner began a podcast, &quot;Frank Skinner&#x27;s Poetry Podcast&quot;, in which he analyses and discusses his favourite poems.

Skinner was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to entertainment.

Skinner took part in &quot;A Show for Gareth Richards&quot; at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2023, which was staged by fellow comedians Mark Simmons and Danny Ward to honour Richards&#x27;s life after he died in a car-crash in April 2023. The show won the first Victoria Wood award at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards 2023 and raised almost £20,000 for Gareth&#x27;s family.

In March 2024, Skinner&#x27;s contract with Absolute Radio was not extended, ending 15 years of his Saturday morning show on the station in May 2024. 

In October 2024, Skinner started a podcast, &quot;Frank Off The Radio&quot;, with a format similar to his previous Absolute Radio show and featuring the same fellow presenters.

In 2024, Skinner performed his show &quot;30 Years of Dirt&quot;.

==Personal life==
Skinner married in 1990, but the marriage was annulled shortly after. He and his longtime partner, Cath Mason, have a son, Buzz Cody, who was born in 2012. 

Raised Roman Catholic, Skinner reconnected with the faith in his 20s, and remains a practising Roman Catholic. He is also a supporter of West Bromwich Albion, and regularly attends games.

Skinner was a victim of the credit crunch in the late 2000s after investing in AIG, losing millions of pounds as a result. He eventually got most of the money back.

Skinner stopped drinking alcohol at age 29, having become concerned when he changed from having sherry for breakfast to pernod. He started performing stand-up comedy shortly afterwards. He has said that he has never been able to replace the &quot;white heat of joy&quot; he got from alcohol and that his social life has never recovered from stopping drinking.

In July 2019, Skinner told &quot;The Times&quot; that he had always voted for the Labour Party, but said he would probably vote for the Green Party at the next election (which was held in December that year).

==Publications==
===Books===
In October 2001, Skinner&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner&quot;, was published. In August 2009, he released a book centred on his return to stand-up after ten years – &quot;Frank Skinner on the Road: Love, Stand-up Comedy and the Queen of the Night&quot;. In September 2011, &quot;The Collected Wisdom of Frank Skinner; Dispatches from the Sofa&quot; was published. It consists of his weekly columns for &quot;The Times&quot;, written from 2009 to 2011. In September 2020, he released a book, &quot;How to Enjoy Poetry&quot;. In it, he uses one poem (&quot;Pad, Pad&quot; by Stevie Smith) to explore the art of poetry. Skinner, who is a practising Christian, released a book of prayers, &quot;A Comedian&#x27;s Prayer Book&quot;, in 2021.

<text>The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter &quot;seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations.&quot; It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter&#x27;s vision proposes that environmental protection, human rights, equitable human development, and peace are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The Earth Charter Initiative organization exists to promote the Charter.

==History==
The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by Maurice Strong and Mikhail Gorbachev as members of The Club of Rome, when the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development called for a new charter to guide the transition to sustainable development. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The Rio Declaration became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, Strong (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and Gorbachev, working through organizations they each founded (the Earth Council and Green Cross International respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a civil society initiative, with the help of the government of the Netherlands.

Strong died in November 2015.

&quot;The Ark of Hope was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001.&quot;

==Drafting==
The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.

One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was Steven Clark Rockefeller, who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at Middlebury College and an advisory trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller, he &quot;chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee&quot;. Other members included Amadou Toumani Touré (Mali), Princess Basma bint Talal (Jordan), Mohamed Sahnoun (Algeria), A. T. Ariyaratne (Sri Lanka), Wakako Hironaka (Japan), Erna Witoelar (Indonesia), Ruud Lubbers (The Netherlands), Federico Mayor (Spain), Mercedes Sosa (Argentina), Leonardo Boff (Brazil), Yolanda Kakabadse (Ecuador), Shridath Ramphal (Guyana), Elizabeth May (Canada), Severn Cullis-Suzuki (Canada), and others.

The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.

== Contents ==
The approximately 2,400 word document is divided into sections (called pillars), which have 16 main principles containing 61 supporting principles. The document opens with a preamble and ends with a conclusion entitled &quot;The Way Forward&quot;.

===Preamble===
=== Principles ===
The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are:

I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life
II. Ecological Integrity
III. Social and Economic Justice
IV. Democracy, Nonviolence, and Peace
==Reaction==
The Charter has been formally endorsed by organizations such as the UNESCO, over 250 universities around the world, the World Conservation Union of IUCN, the Indian National Capital Territory of Delhi, the 2001 U.S. Conference of Mayors, and dozens of youth organizations.

Various religious groups from a wide range of religions support the Earth Charter. The Soka Gakkai International, representing more than 12 million Buddhists worldwide, has supported the Earth Charter since its inception. The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations representing over 1000 Unitarian Universalist congregations in the United States supports the measure. The official body of the Baháʼí Faith religion reacted by saying &quot;While not officially endorsing the Earth Charter, the Baháʼí International Community considers the effort toward drafting it and activities in support of its essential objectives to be highly commendable, and it will continue to participate in related activities, such as conferences, forums and the like.&quot; The World Pantheist Movement, which supports a naturalistic view of religion, endorses the plan. The Leadership Conference of Women Religious, a Catholic organization in the United States approved the measure in 2004. The Episcopal Diocese of Newark (New Jersey), an Episcopalian Christian organization, endorsed the Earth Charter in 2009.

In May 1992, more than 650 representatives of indigenous peoples adopted their own 109-point Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter. Representatives of indigenous peoples also participated in the Earth Charter consultations in 1996. In 2000, the Russian Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), representing 31 indigenous peoples living in Siberia and far eastern Russia, formally endorsed the Earth Charter.

Mayor Hsu of Tainan, a city of 750,000 in Taiwan, endorsed the charter in 2007. The cities of Corvallis (Oregon), Berkeley (California), Pickering (Canada) and 21 towns in Vermont have endorsed the measure. Nine other towns in Vermont rejected measures endorsing the Earth Charter.

Engineers Without Borders, an international association whose mission is to help its member groups assist poor communities in their respective countries and around the world, also endorses the Earth Charter. The Green Party of Botswana supports the plan. The African Conservation Foundation describes the Earth Charter movement as a &quot;partner&quot;.

In the UK, Bournemouth Borough Council endorsed the Charter in 2008.

Earth Charter International, the organization responsible for promoting the Charter, states in its literature that the Earth Charter is respectful and inclusive of all religious traditions. They say that the Charter itself makes no statements to support claims of intent to supplant any of the world&#x27;s religions or to create a world government. ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity&#x27;s shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.

===Criticism===
The Charter has received opposition from several groups. For example, in the United States, members of religious groups, such as the Religious Right have objected to the document on the grounds that it is secular, and espouses socialism. In addition, some conservatives cite an informal comment by Mikhail Gorbachev that the document is &quot;a kind of Ten Commandments&quot;; and point to the fact that at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, a copy of the document was placed symbolically in an &quot;Ark of Hope&quot; — an independent project by the American artist Sally Linder.

<doc id="552876" wikidata="Q928157" url="?curid=552876" title="Bronx River">
<text>The Bronx River (), is a river that is approximately long, and flows through southeastern New York in the United States and drains an area of . It is named after colonial settler Jonas Bronck.

It originally rose in what is now the Kensico Reservoir, in Westchester County north of New York City, on a hill about 650 feet above sea level in what is now New Castle, New York. The river originated in an area the Weckquasgeek called Quaropes, which means White Marshes. It was fed by the Fulton Brook, Manhattan Park Brook, Davis Brook, and Tompkins Brook. With the construction of the Kensico Dam in 1885, however, the river was cut off from its natural headwaters and today a small tributary stream originating from the reservoir serves as its source. The Bronx River flows south past White Plains, then south-southwest through the northern suburbs in New York, passing through Edgemont, Tuckahoe, Eastchester, and Bronxville. In the area known as the Aquehung, it is fed by Harts Brook and the north and south Fox Meadow Brooks. At Tuckahoe, it is fed by Troublesome Brook. At Bronxville, it is fed by Sprain Brook, its longest tributary system, which originates at Greenburgh Town Park.

The river divides Westchester County into eastern and western areas, forming the border between the large cities of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, and flows into the northern end of The Bronx, where it divides East Bronx from West Bronx, southward through Bronx Park, New York Botanical Garden, and the Bronx Zoo and continues through neighborhoods of the South Bronx. It empties into the East River, a tidal strait connected to Long Island Sound, between the Soundview and Hunts Point neighborhoods.

== Etymology ==
Prior to European settlement, The Bronx River Valley was known as Laaphawachking--&quot;the place of stringing lakes.&quot;

In the 17th century, the river—called by the natives &quot;Aquehung&quot;—served as a boundary between loosely associated bands under sachems of the informal confederacy of the Wecquaesgeek. Europeanized as the Wappinger, the east bank of the river was the boundary for the Siwanoy, clammers and fishermen. The same line was retained when manors were granted to the Dutch and the English. 

The Algonkian significance of the name is variously reported. The &quot;acca-&quot; element, as represented in the Long Island place-name Accabonac, was deformed into the more familiar, suitably watery European morpheme &quot;aque-&quot;.

The tract purchased by Jonas Bronck, a Swedish immigrant, in 1639 lay between the Harlem River and the river that came to be called &quot;Bronck&#x27;s river&quot;.

==Pollution==
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the river became a natural sewer into which industrial waste was poured every day. An early mill on the industrialized river was the Lorillard Snuff Mill, preserved in the grounds of the New York Botanical Garden. With the decline of manufacturing in the area, the river continued to receive water pollution from the communities that lined its banks. In December 1948, flow of the Bronx River was changed to eliminate a curve in its course in Bronxville, to create land on the old riverbed on which to construct an addition to Lawrence Hospital. During the excavations a large sand bar was uncovered where sand had accumulated at the bend over hundreds of years and made a sandy beach.

In the 21st century, environmental groups including the Bronx River Alliance proposed to return the river to its original state as a clean waterway. The river became a favorite project of U.S. Representative José Serrano, who secured US$14.6 million in federal funding to support the rehabilitation of the waterway, into which some Westchester towns continued to discharge raw sewage intermittently, as sanitary sewer overflows, as late as 2006. Under a November 2006, agreement, the municipalities of Scarsdale, White Plains, Mount Vernon and Greenburgh agreed to stop dumping sewage in the Bronx River by May 2007.

Urban runoff pollution continues to be a serious problem for the river. The Bronx River Watershed Coalition, a partnership of local and state agencies, citizen groups and non-profit organizations, have developed watershed management plans to reduce stormwater pollution and improve water quality.

==Ecology==

Local alewife were released in the river in March 2006. They taken from a coastal tributary in nearby Connecticut. The alewife spawn in the river&#x27;s headwaters. Their offspring spend the summer in the river, migrate out to sea in the fall, and in three to five years return, like all anadromous fish, to their spawning grounds. Stocking was repeated annually for the following five years, to build up the new resident population.

The fish, among a group called &quot;river herring,&quot; feed low on the food-chain and help reduce eutrophication. Several adult alewife were found below the first dam on the river in April 2009. An analysis revealed they were 3 years old, with the assumption of scientists being that these were descendants of the alewife released 3 years before in March 2006.

The next step will be to erect fish ladders, aka. fish passageways over the 3 dams lowest on the river, allowing the alewife access to a portion of the river with more suitable spawning habitat. In 2015 a fish passageway was built at the 182nd Street dam.

In February 2007 biologists with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the Zoo, spotted a beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) in the river. &quot;There has not been a sighting of a beaver lodge or a beaver in New York City for over 200 years. It sounds fantastic, but one of the messages that comes out of this is if you give wildlife a chance it will come back,&quot; said John Calvelli, a spokesman for the Society. The beaver is named Jose Serrano, after the Congressman, and was sighted below the East Tremont bridge at Drew Gardens as recently as June 2009. 

Beavers had not lived in New York City since the early 19th century, when trappers extirpated them completely from the state. In the summer of 2010 a second beaver joined Jose, doubling the beaver population in New York City. Beaver were once important to the city&#x27;s economy. A pair of beaver appear on the city&#x27;s official seal and flag.

A pod of dolphins visited the river in January 2023.

==Recreational amenities==

Along much of its length in Westchester County and the northern Bronx the river is paralleled by the Bronx River Parkway. It has a bicycle path from Bronxville to the Kensico Dam plaza. The Bronx River Greenway project proposes a unified management plan for the narrow ribbon of riverside green spaces in the in which the river passes through Westchester County and the Bronx, as part of the East Coast Greenway. It includes Concrete Plant Park on the right bank, below Westchester Avenue and Starlight Park above there. Construction on the Bronx River Greenway started in October 2016.

In the South Bronx, the river has become a popular destination for urban canoeing in New York City. It bisects Bronx Park and the Bronx Zoo. A monorail built in the late 20th century takes zoo visitors over the river to an exhibit of Asian animals on the left bank, with a narration presenting the river as the Irrawaddy.

Shoelace Park is a one-mile long linear park on the east bank of the Bronx River, from 211th to 231st Street in the Wakefield and Williamsbridge areas of the Bronx. Officially named Bronx River Park, it is more commonly known as Shoelace Park because of its shape. The park was renovated in 2020 to create bicycle and pedestrian paths over what was the original roadbed of the Bronx River Parkway. A small pier at 219th street provides access to the river for canoes and kayaks.

==Waterfalls, culverts, storm water outfalls, and inlets==
The fragmentation of the Bronx River by dams has eliminated diadromous species from the river system, and as human development has progressed across the Bronx river, historic fish migration routes have been severed. According to the NYC Department of Environmental Protection: &quot;At the beginning of the 18th Century, roughly 12 water mills were producing paper, pottery, flour, tapestries, and snuff along the Bronx River.&quot; Several identified blockages, according to a 2004 NYC Parks report, include the 182nd Street Dam, the Bronx Zoo Dam, the Snuff Mill Dam, and the Westchester dams. As a result of these long term blockages, NYC parks did not expect fish to return to these migration routes, requiring the release of fish in historical spawning areas after fish passage remediation. In 2011, New York City parks began the process of adding a 1.5 million passage to Bronx Park, which is adjacent to the Bronx River. The project, including dam repair in addition to construction of the fish ladder, was slated to be one of three fish ladders that were to be installed across the Bronx River.

Restoration programs based on fishway construction and hatcheries may have sustained remnant populations, but large-scale restoration has not been achieved.

<doc id="552878" wikidata="Q1840684" url="?curid=552878" title="Privacy-Enhanced Mail">
<text>Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) is a de facto file format for storing and sending cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data, based on a set of 1993 IETF standards defining &quot;privacy-enhanced mail.&quot; While the original standards were never broadly adopted and were supplanted by PGP and S/MIME, the textual encoding they defined became very popular. The PEM format was eventually formalized by the IETF in .

==Format==
Many cryptography standards use ASN.1 to define their data structures, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) to serialize those structures. Because DER produces binary output, it can be challenging to transmit the resulting files through systems, like electronic mail, that only support ASCII.

The PEM format solves this problem by encoding the binary data using base64. PEM also defines a one-line header, consisting of , a label, and , and a one-line footer, consisting of , a label, and . The label determines the type of message encoded. Common labels include , , and .
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
PEM data is commonly stored in files with a &quot;.pem&quot; suffix, a &quot;.cer&quot; or &quot;.crt&quot; suffix (for certificates), or a &quot;.key&quot; suffix (for public or private keys). The label inside a PEM file represents the type of the data more accurately than the file suffix, since many different types of data can be saved in a &quot;.pem&quot; file. In particular PEM refers to the header and base64 wrapper for a binary format contained within, but does not specify any type or format for the binary data, so that a PEM file may contain &quot;almost anything base64 encoded and wrapped with BEGIN and END lines&quot;.

===Examples===
* An operating system might provide a PEM file containing a list of trusted CA certificates, each of which in its own BEGIN/END sections;
* A web server might be configured with a &quot;chain&quot; file containing an end-entity certificate plus a list of intermediate certificates, each of which in its own BEGIN/END sections.

== Privacy-enhanced mail ==
The PEM format was first developed in the privacy-enhanced mail series of RFCs: RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424. These standards assumed prior deployment of a hierarchical public key infrastructure (PKI) with a single root. Such a PKI was never deployed, due to operational cost and legal liability concerns. These standards were eventually obsoleted by PGP and S/MIME, competing e-mail encryption standards.

== History ==
The initiative to develop Privacy Enhanced Mail began in 1985 on behalf of the PSRG (Privacy and Security Research Group) also known as the Internet Research Task Force. This task force is a subsidiary of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and their efforts have resulted in the Requests for Comment (RFCs) which are suggested Internet guidelines.

<text>The Aïr Mountains or Aïr Massif (Tamajăq: &quot;Ayǝr&quot;; Hausa:  &quot;Azbin&quot;,  &quot;Abzin&quot;) is a triangular massif, located in northern Niger, within the Sahara. Part of the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, they rise to more than and extend over . Lying in the midst of desert north of the 17th parallel, the Aïr plateau, with an average altitude between , forms an island of Sahel climate which supports a wide variety of life, many pastoral and farming communities, and dramatic geological and archaeological sites. There are notable archaeological excavations in the region that illustrate the prehistoric past of this region. The endangered African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;) once existed in this region, but may now be extirpated due to human population pressures in this region.

==Geology==

The Precambrian to Cenozoic Aïr Mountains consist of peralkaline granite intrusions which appear dark in colour (unusual since most granitic masses are light-toned in the field). In the Sahara Desert such mountains often stand out in stark relief as topographic heights amidst lowlands covered by sand. The terrain consists of high plateau, mountain ranges, and broad, sandy valleys and seasonal wadis which once contained rivers. Areas of these deep, often intersecting, valleys also contain waterborne clay and silt deposits. Underground watercourses in some of these valleys continue to provide year-round oasis and seasonal vegetation.
The Aïr mountains themselves consist of nine almost circular massifs rising from a rocky plateau, bordered by the sand dunes and plain of the Ténéré Desert to the east. The massif is a plateau consisting of a sub-Cambrian age erosion surface on Precambrian metamorphic rocks, punctuated by a series of flat-topped, granite intrusion peaks, which include Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès (Niger&#x27;s highest point at 2022 m), Mont Tamgak (1988 m), Mont Greboun (1944 m), Adrar Bous, Fadei, Chirriet, Taghmert, Agueraguer, Takaloukouzet, and Goundai.

The massif contains volcanic features including the extinct caldera of Arakao, Cenozoic lava flows of hawaiite to trachyte composition, volcanic cones, tuff rings and one of the largest ring dike systems in the world. At Izouzaoenehe, lie the marble Blue Mountains, and the lower Zagado valley is surrounded by white marble hills. Carboniferous sandstone and coal units in the Iullemmeden Basin just to the west of the massif contain uranium mineralisation sourced from the granites of the massif.


==Climate==

Because of its altitude (on average between 500 and 900 m) and despite its low rainfall (50 to 160 mm/year on the lower plateau), the Aïr forms a green region in comparison with the surrounding deserts, especially after the August–September seasonal rains. The climate is classified as Sahel, like that of the regions well to its south. While the mountains are largely bare of vegetation, the dry wadi river valleys (known by the Hausa term &quot;Kori&quot;) channel and hold rainwater in gueltas (stone pools, such as that near the town of Timia), creating oases which provide forage for animals, and in some areas, farming. The high Bagzane plateau of the central Aïr in particular provides adequate rainfall for intensive agriculture. Other, vast, areas of the region are entirely devoid of plant life and with their volcanic protrusions and rock fields present an otherworldly appearance.

==Vegetation==
More than 430 vascular species have been recorded so far in the Aïr mountains. The location of the Aïr as a southern extension of the Hoggar mountain range makes it a connection between the Saharan Flora and the Sahelian Flora. However, the presence of mountains up to 2000 m a.s.l. generates locally favourable conditions for several species of the Sudanian zone and the Mediterranean zone.

During the 20th century a series of scientific missions in the Aïr has permitted to identify the majority of plant species developing in the Aïr. &quot;Vachellia tortilis&quot;, subsp. &quot;raddiana&quot; (&quot;afagag&quot;) and &quot;Balanites aegyptiaca&quot; (&quot;aborak&quot;) are among the most frequent tree species in the intermountain zone. In the vicinity of temporary rivers named &quot;koris&quot;, species like &quot;Vachellia nilotica&quot;, &quot;Faidherbia albida&quot; and the palm &quot;Hyphaene thebaica&quot; coexist with date palm cultivars (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;). Severe droughts and high aridity have made the intermountain zone of the Aïr a particularly harsh place for plants to develop. The additional presence of domestic herbivores has led to a severe deficit in tree regeneration, which has been cited as a major ecological concern. Tree regeneration has been observed enhanced as soon as tree seedlings are protected by large tussocks of the frequent grass &quot;Panicum turgidum&quot;. This positive interaction between plants represents a promising restoration tool to be used by local inhabitants.

In comparison, mountainous areas are even less documented. Tropical tree species less resistant to drought have been described in the highlands, among which the Fabaceae &quot;Senegalia laeta&quot; and &quot;Vachellia seyal&quot;. Quezel has observed the remnant presence of a rare endemic taxon related to the olive in the northern sector of the Aïr range. Recently, this taxon, &quot;Olea europaea&quot; subsp. &quot;laperrinei&quot;, has been found in other mountains of the Aïr: these very isolated, small populations represent the southern limit of the species distribution.

A study led on the slopes of the highest summit in the Aïr, Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès (2022 m a.s.l.), identified plant species that had never been inventoried in Niger before. Among them, &quot;Pachycymbium decaisneanum&quot;, &quot;Cleome aculeata&quot;, &quot;Echinops mildbraedii&quot; and &quot;Indigofera nummularia&quot; are tropical species with relatively low resistance to water stress, whereas &quot;Silene lynesii&quot;, &quot;Tephrosia elegans&quot;, and &quot;Echinops mildbraedii&quot; have a Saharan-Mediterranean distribution. Three ferns were found for the first time in the Aïr recently, &quot;Cheilanthes coriacea&quot;, &quot;Actiniopteris radiata&quot;, and &quot;Ophioglossum polyphyllum&quot;, suggesting that ferns may be more prone to develop in arid environments than commonly proposed. All these data evidence a marked mountain climatic specificity in the Aïr, with a positive impact on species richness and species diversity. Because of their strong geographic isolation within a Saharan matrix, these species have a high conservation value.

==Population==
The town of Agadez in the heart of the Tuareg country is the capital of Aïr. Much of the Tuareg population of Aïr until recently led a nomadic life, relying essentially on camel and goats from which they take milk, meat and skins used in the production of local handicrafts. Most sedentary populations were either dependents of higher caste Tuareg pastoralists or the Ikelan (&quot;Bouzou&quot; in Hausa / &quot;Bella&quot; in Songhai), Tuareg slaves. These peoples were settled in northern oases, to tend the date palm plantations held by the noble clans.

Agriculture products from oases such as Timia, Aouderas and Tabelot are traditionally exchanged against clothes, or salt, brought by camel caravans (Azalai) from the remote Tenere oases of Bilma and Fachi to the east.

==History==

The Aïr is known for its rock art, dating from 6000 BCE to around 1000CE. During the African humid period, the region was a pastoral area, as is illustrated by images of cattle and large mammals. During the 3rd millennium BC, however, a process of desertification began and the Tuareg from further north migrated into the region. Later art indicated war, depicting horses and chariots. In particular, the five-meter-high carvings of the &quot;Dabous Giraffes&quot; discovered in 1999 is internationally famous. Cave art in the region is predominantly stone carving, initially with sharp rock, and from around 1200 BC perhaps with metal.

When the Tuareg tribes were pushed south by Arab invaders in the eighth and ninth centuries, there were Gobirwa Hausa in the southern Aïr. Successive Tuareg &quot;Kel&quot;s have controlled the area since at least the twelfth century. Agadez, as well as In-Gall to the east, were the farthest outposts of the Songhai Empire in the early 15th century. In the sixteenth century, the area fell under the newly created Tuareg Sultanate of Agadez, and remained so until the arrival of the French at the end of the 19th.

The emergence of the French weakened the Tuareg Kels and provoked both infighting and resistance to colonialism. From the 1880s, Toubu raids increased, and when the Tuareg Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen rose against the French in 1917, many towns were destroyed on his way to the siege of Agadez. When the French retook Agadez, a brutal punitive expedition through the Aïr left many formerly populous places abandoned, razed by Kaosen and the French successively.

While the Kel Owey continued to dominate the settled oasis towns and pastoral herding, the sedentary farmers (Tuareg, Hausa, or Songhai) expanded farming and sedentary livestock cultivation in the mid-20th century.

The famines of the 1970s and 1980s brought an end to this expansion, and as Agadez and Arlit grew, the towns of the Aïr have shrunk. The first Tuareg rebellion of 1990-95 saw brutal government reprisals which depopulated many villages in the Aïr. Peace from the mid-1990s, as well as the uranium mines of Arlit brought unprecedented growth to the region, with many small towns gaining valuable tourism revenue. In 2004, a locust invasion ravaged many gardens, bringing scarcity and contributing to the Second Tuareg Rebellion of 2007–2009. Unrest continues in the region, effectively ending the nascent tourist industry.

<text>The Higher Education Authority (HEA), officially An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, is the statutory body providing policy advice for higher education in Ireland.

==Description and functions==
The HEA was established under the Higher Education Authority Act 1971. Its official Irish language name is An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas. The 1971 Act was repealed and replaced by the Higher Education Authority Act 2022, with the HEA continuing in operation. The HEA has a statutory responsibility for the effective governance of higher education in Ireland. It provides policy advice to the Irish Government across various aspects of the mission of higher education. According to their website, the aim of the HEA is &quot;to create a coherent system of diverse institutions with distinct missions, which is responsive to the social, cultural and economic development of Ireland and its people and supports the achievement of national objectives&quot;.
The authority has a statutory responsibility, at central government level, for the governance and regulation of higher education institutions and the higher education system. The authority is responsible for the funding of Irish universities, institutes of technology and other third level colleges.

The HEA was responsible for administering the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI), which provided funding for research from 1998 to around 2018.

== Governance ==

<doc id="552888" wikidata="Q5125292" url="?curid=552888" title="Claire Rayner">
<text>Claire Berenice Rayner, OBE (; Berkovitch, later Chetwynd; 22 January 1931 – 11 October 2010) was a British journalist, broadcaster, novelist and nurse, best known for her role for many years as an advice columnist.

==Early life==
Rayner was born to Jewish parents in Stepney, London, the eldest of four children. Her father was a tailor and her mother a housewife. Her father had adopted the surname Chetwynd, under which name she was educated at the City of London School for Girls. 

Her autobiography &quot;How Did I Get Here from There?&quot; was published in 2003, and revealed details of a childhood marred by physical and mental cruelty at the hands of her parents. After the family emigrated to Canada, in 1945 she was placed in a psychiatric hospital by her parents, and treated for 15 months for a thyroid defect.

==Career==

===Nursing===
Returning to the UK in 1951, Rayner trained as a nurse at the Royal Northern Hospital and Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London. She intended to become a physician; while training as a nurse, however, she met actor Desmond Rayner, whom she married in 1957. The couple lived in London and Claire worked as a midwife and later nursing sister.

===Journalist and writer===
Rayner wrote her first letter to &quot;Nursing Times&quot; in 1958, on nurses&#x27; pay and conditions. She then began regularly writing to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on themes of patient care or nurses&#x27; pay. She began writing novels soon after her marriage, and by 1968 had published more than 25 books.

The birth of her first child in 1960 meant that she found full-time nursing difficult, and so focused on a full-time writing career. Initially writing articles for magazines and publications, in 1968 she published one of the earliest sex manuals, &quot;People in Love&quot;, which brought her to national attention. Despite the &quot;explicit&quot; content, the work was commended for its &quot;down-to-earth&quot; and &quot;sensible&quot; approach.

By the 1970s, Rayner had established herself in writing for &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot; as one of four new and direct &quot;agony aunts&quot;, alongside Marjorie Proops, Peggy Makins (aka Evelyn Home) at &quot;Woman&quot; and J. Firbank of &quot;Forum&quot;. Her advice in the teenaged girls&#x27; magazine &quot;Petticoat&quot; caused controversy. In 1972, she was accused of &quot;encouraging masturbation and promiscuity in prepubescent girls&quot;. Her direct and frank approach led the BBC to ask her to be the first person on British pre-watershed television to demonstrate how to put on a condom, and she was one of the first people used by advertisers to promote sanitary towels.

The year after beginning to appear on &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;, Rayner started an agony column in &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1973, but left to join the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; in 1980, when she also made her second television series of &quot;Claire Rayner&#x27;s Casebook.&quot; She left the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; shortly after the appointment of Eve Pollard as editor, and joined the &quot;Today&quot; newspaper for three years. Rayner was named medical journalist of the year in 1987.

Rayner was probably best known as an agony aunt on TV-am in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She made it her personal aim to reply to every letter she received. This was an unfunded project by the station.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1989, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel.

===Campaigner===
Rayner became president of the Patients Association, and through her extensive charity work and writings was appointed OBE in 1996 for services to women&#x27;s health and wellbeing and to health matters. Rayner had a very personal reason for supporting Sense&#x27;s Older Person campaign, wearing hearing aids in both ears, and also had age-related dry macular degeneration (AMD), a sight loss common in older people.

Between 1993 and 2002, Rayner was one of the patrons of the Herpes Viruses Association and chaired a Press Briefing in June 1993 aimed at destigmatising genital herpes. When tendering her resignation, she cited the fact that she was patron of 60 organisations as the reason for trimming the list.

Rayner was appointed to UK government committees on health, and consequently authored a chapter in &quot;The Future of the NHS&quot;. Despite being president of the Patients Association, Rayner used private health care. was a member of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Commission on Nursing; the Labour government&#x27;s Royal Commission on the Care of the Elderly. In 1999, Rayner was appointed to a committee responsible for reviewing the medical conditions at Holloway Prison, London, at the direction of Paul Boateng who was then the Minister for Prisons. The recommendations of this committee led to far-reaching changes in the provision of medical care within Holloway.

A lifelong Labour Party supporter, she resigned in 2001 and joined the Liberal Democrats in fear of the proposed changes to the NHS from the administration of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Rayner was also a prominent supporter of the British republican movement, although admitted her dual standards on accepting her OBE in 1996.

Rayner was Vice-President (and formerly President) of the British Humanist Association, a Distinguished Supporter of the Humanist Society Scotland and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. In the weeks leading up to her death, Rayner had the following to say about Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the United Kingdom:
Rayner&#x27;s position as a patron of the Down&#x27;s Syndrome Association was promptly terminated in 1995. She had queried parents&#x27; decision to have a disabled child:

It was a response to the decision of journalist Dominic Lawson and his wife not to have a test determining the health of the foetus during a pregnancy and thus, following one potential result, rejecting outright the option of a termination. It was published shortly after the birth of the couple&#x27;s disabled daughter.

==Personal life==
Rayner met her husband, actor Desmond Rayner, at Maccabi in Hampstead; the couple married in 1957. They had three children together: writer and food critic Jay Rayner, electronics reviewer, angling and motoring journalist Adam Rayner and events manager Amanda Rayner.

Rayner was found to have breast cancer in 2002 at the age of 71. She became a breast cancer activist to promote the work of the charity Cancer Research UK. She also suffered from Graves&#x27; disease and became a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation in 1994.

Rayner never recovered from emergency intestinal surgery undertaken in May 2010, and died in hospital on 11 October 2010. She told her relatives she wanted her last words to be: &quot;Tell David Cameron that if he screws up my beloved NHS I&#x27;ll come back and bloody haunt him.&quot;

==Publications==
Rayner was a prolific author of both fiction and non-fiction.

<doc id="552889" wikidata="Q574383" url="?curid=552889" title="Airbreathing catfish">
<text>Airbreathing catfish comprise the family Clariidae of the order Siluriformes. Sixteen genera and about 117 species of clariid fishes are described; all are freshwater species. Other groups of catfish also breathe air, such as the Callichthyidae and Loricariidae.

==Distribution==
Although clariids occur in India, Syria, southern Turkey, and large parts of Southeast Asia, their diversity is the largest in Africa.

==Description==
Clariid catfish are characterized by an elongated body, the presence of four barbels, long dorsal and anal fins, and especially by the autapomorphic presence of a suprabranchial organ, formed by tree-like structures from the second and fourth gill arches. This suprabranchial organ, or labyrinth organ, allows some species the capability of traveling short distances on land (walking catfish).

The dorsal fin base is very long and is not preceded by a fin spine. The dorsal fin may or may not be continuous with the caudal fin, which is rounded. Pectoral and pelvic fins are variously absent in some species. Some fish have small eyes and reduced or absent pectoral and pelvic fins for a burrowing lifestyle. A few species are blind.

Within the family Clariidae, body forms range from fusiform (torpedo-like) to anguilliform (eel-like). As species become more eel-shaped, a whole set of morphological changes has been observed, such as decrease and loss of the adipose fin, continuous unpaired fins, reduction of paired fins, reduction of the eyes, reduction of the skull bones, and hypertrophied jaw muscles.

==Taxonomy==
The Heteropneustidae containing the genus &quot;Heteropneustes&quot; are considered by some to be a separate family and by others to be a subfamily. With the Heteropneustidae and Clariidae as separate families, a recent paper groups them into a superfamily called the Clarioidea. The relationships of clarioids to other families remains uncertain.

==Relationship to humans==
Many clariids form a large part of artisanal fisheries. &quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot; is recognized as one of the most promising aquaculture species in Africa.

The airbreathing capacity of these fish has allowed such fish as &quot;Clarias batrachus&quot; to be an invasive species in Florida.

<text>Powers Allen Boothe (June 1, 1948 – May 14, 2017) was an American actor known for his commanding character actor roles on film and television. He received a Primetime Emmy Award and nominations for two Screen Actors Guild Awards.

He won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his portrayal of Jim Jones in &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot; (1980). He also played saloon owner Cy Tolliver on &quot;Deadwood&quot; from 2004 to 2006, President Noah Daniels on &quot;24&quot; in 2007, and Lamar Wyatt in &quot;Nashville&quot; from 2012 to 2014. He also appeared in the limited series &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot; (2012).

He is also known for his performances as &quot;Curly Bill&quot; Brocius in the western &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993) and Alexander Haig in historical drama &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995). Other notable film roles include &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; (1981), &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (1994), &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (1995), &quot;Frailty&quot; (2001), and &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005). 

He portrayed Gideon Malick in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), and in the ABC series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; from 2015 to 2016. He was also the voice of Gorilla Grodd in &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

== Early life ==
Boothe, the youngest of three boys, was born June 1, 1948, at home on a cotton farm in Snyder, Texas, to Merrill Vestal Boothe, a rancher, and his wife Emily (née Reeves) Boothe. His father named him after his best friend, who had been killed in World War II.

Boothe attended Snyder High School, where he played football and appeared in school plays. He was the first in his family to go beyond high school, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, and earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in Drama from Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas.

==Career==
After graduating from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, Boothe joined the repertory company of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, with roles in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; (portraying Henry IV of England), &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and others. His New York City stage debut was in the 1974 Lincoln Center production of &quot;Richard III&quot;. Five years later, his Broadway theater debut came in a starring role in the one-act play &quot;Lone Star&quot;, written by James McLure. 

Boothe first came to national attention in 1980, playing Jim Jones in the CBS TV film &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot;. Boothe&#x27;s portrayal of the crazed cult leader received critical acclaim. In &quot;Time&quot; story on the production, Boothe was praised: &quot;There is one extraordinary performance. A young actor named Powers Boothe captures all the charisma and evil of &#x27;Dad&#x27;, Jim Jones.&quot; Boothe won the Emmy Award for his role, beating out veterans Henry Fonda and Jason Robards. As the Screen Actors Guild were on strike in the fall of 1980, he was the only actor to cross picket lines to attend the ceremonies and accept his award, saying at the time, &quot;This may be either the bravest moment of my career or the dumbest.&quot;

Boothe portrayed Philip Marlowe in a TV series based on Raymond Chandler&#x27;s short stories for HBO in the 1980s. He appeared in such films as &quot;Southern Comfort&quot;, &quot;A Breed Apart&quot;, &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Emerald Forest&quot;, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; and &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot;, as well as the HBO films &quot;Into the Homeland&quot; and &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;. In 1989, Boothe appeared in the Mosfilm production of &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, in which he played the role of General Chuikov, commander of the Soviet 62nd Army. Additionally, he appeared in the 1990 CBS-TV film &quot;Family of Spies&quot;, in which he played traitor Navy Officer John Walker. Boothe portrayed Curly Bill Brocius in the hit 1993 Western &quot;Tombstone&quot;, the disloyal senior Army officer in &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (opposite Jessica Lange&#x27;s Oscar-winning performance), and the sinister lead terrorist in &quot;Sudden Death&quot;. He was also part of the large ensemble casts for Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot; (as Chief of Staff Alexander Haig) and &quot;U Turn&quot; (as the town sheriff).

In 2001, he starred as Flavius Aëtius, the Roman general in charge of stopping the Hun invasion in the made-for-TV miniseries &quot;Attila&quot;. Boothe played a featured role as brothel-owner Cy Tolliver on the HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, and the corrupt senator Ethan Roark in the motion picture &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), as well as its sequel, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot; (2014). He is the voice of one of the characters in the 2005 video game &quot;Area 51&quot; and of Gorilla Grodd, the hyper-intelligent telepathic supervillain in &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. He voiced the villain, Kane, in the 2008 video game &quot;Turok&quot;.

He was a special guest star on &quot;24&quot;, where he played Vice President Noah Daniels. He returned in the prequel to the seventh season, &quot;24: Redemption&quot;. Just after taking the role as acting President, Boothe is seen exiting Air Force Two with F-15s in the background. Boothe played a downed F-15 pilot in &quot;Red Dawn&quot;. In March 2008, he narrated a television campaign ad for Senator John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign.

In 2012, Boothe appeared in Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot; as Gideon Malick, a shadowy governmental superior to S.H.I.E.L.D. From 2015 to 16, he reprised the role in the ABC series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;

Boothe appeared in the 2012 miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot; as Judge Valentine &quot;Wall&quot; Hatfield. Boothe was also cast as Lamar Wyatt in the ABC musical drama series &quot;Nashville&quot;. Boothe also lent his voice to &quot;&quot;, a 2012 video game developed by IO Interactive, voicing the character of Benjamin Travis.

== Personal life ==
Boothe married his college sweetheart Pam Cole in 1969 and they remained married until his death. They had two children, Parisse and Preston.

Boothe was a member of the Friends of Abe.

<doc id="552897" wikidata="Q59635" url="?curid=552897" title="Randy Savage">
<text>Randy Mario Poffo (November 15, 1952 – May 20, 2011), better known by his ring name &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, was an American professional wrestler and professional baseball player, best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

Savage was described by sportswriter Bill Simmons as &quot;one of the greatest pro wrestlers who ever lived&quot;a statement echoed by multiple industry performers. He was recognizable by wrestling fans for his distinctively flamboyant ring attire and raspy voice, intensity exhibited in and out of the ring, use of the finale from &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March no. 1&quot; by Elgar as his entrance music, and signature catchphrase, &quot;Oooh yeah!&quot; For most of his tenures in the WWF and WCW, Savage was managed by his real-life wife, Miss Elizabeth.

Savage had ten world championship reigns during his 32-year career, including two as WWF World Heavyweight Champion and four as WCW World Heavyweight Champion. As WWF Champion, he held similar drawing power as Hulk Hogan. A one-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, he was named by WWE as the greatest titleholder of all time and credited for bringing &quot;a higher level of credibility to the title through his amazing in-ring performances&quot;.

Savage was the 1987 WWF King of the Ring and the 1995 WCW World War 3 winner. He headlined many pay-per-view events throughout his career, including WrestleManias IV and V, two of the first five SummerSlam shows, and Starrcade 1995. He was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame upon its inception in 1996, with a posthumous WWE Hall of Fame induction following in 2015.

==Early life==
Randy Poffo was born on November 15, 1952, in Columbus, Ohio, the eldest son of Judith ( Sverdlin) and Angelo Poffo. His father was Italian American and his mother was Jewish American; Poffo was raised Catholic. Randy&#x27;s father was a well-known wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, and his younger brother Lanny Poffo also went into wrestling.

The Poffo family lived in Zanesville, Ohio, where Randy attended Grover Cleveland Middle School. He graduated from Downers Grove North High School in the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove, Illinois. Poffo later moved to Staten Island, New York, before moving to Lexington, Kentucky, where he lived for many years. He was an alumnus of Southern Illinois University–Carbondale.

== Baseball career ==
Savage was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a catcher out of high school. He was placed in the minor leagues to develop, where he mostly played as an outfielder in the Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds farm systems. Savage was 18 when he began playing minor league baseball; one of his teammates on the 1971 Gulf Coast League Cardinals was Larry Herndon, who was also his roommate. Savage would swing a bat into a hanging car tire to strengthen his hands and utilize his legs during swings. The technique was so effective that Herndon used it during his career as a baseball coach. Savage injured his natural (right) throwing shoulder after a collision at home plate, and he learned to throw with his left arm instead. Savage&#x27;s last season was 1974, when he played for the Class A Tampa Tarpons in the Reds organization. He played 289 games over four minor league seasons, batting .254 with 16 home runs and 129 runs batted in.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (19731985) ===

Savage first broke into the wrestling business in 1973 during the fall and winter of the baseball off-season. His first wrestling character, The Spider, was similar to Spider-Man. He later took the ring name Randy Savage at the suggestion of his longtime friend and trainer Terry &quot;The Goose&quot; Stephens and Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) booker Ole Anderson, who said that the name Poffo did not fit someone who &quot;wrestled like a savage&quot;. Savage eventually decided to end his stalled baseball career and join his father and brother to wrestle full time. He wrestled his first match against Midwest Territory wrestler &quot;Golden Boy&quot; Paul Christy. Savage worked with his father and brother in Michigan, the Carolinas, Georgia, the Maritimes, and the eastern Tennessee territory run by Nick Gulas.

After a while, his father felt that his sons were not getting the pushes they deserved so he started the &quot;outlaw&quot; International Championship Wrestling (ICW) promotion in the mid-American states. Eventually, ICW disbanded and Randy and Lanny entered the Memphis scene, joining Jerry Lawler&#x27;s Continental Wrestling Association (their former competitors). While there, Savage feuded with Lawler over the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. He also teamed with Lanny to battle The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express; this feud included a match on June 25, 1984, in Memphis, where in the storyline, Savage injured Ricky Morton by piledriving him through the timekeeper&#x27;s table, leading to the Express winning by disqualification. Later in 1984, Savage turned babyface and allied with Lawler against Jimmy Hart&#x27;s First Family alliance, only to turn heel on Lawler again in early 1985 and resume the feud with him over the title. This ended when Lawler beat Savage in a Loser Leaves Town match on June 7 in Memphis, Tennessee.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985–1994) ===

==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1985–1987) ====
In June 1985, Savage signed with Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He made his WWF debut on the July 6 episode of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;, defeating local competitor Aldo Marino. Billed as &quot;the top free agent in pro wrestling&quot;, Savage&#x27;s first appearances on &quot;Tuesday Night Titans&quot; featured several established managers (including Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan, Jimmy Hart, Mr. Fuji, Johnny Valiant, and &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie) offering their services to Savage. He declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth as his new manager on the August 24 episode of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;. His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone who even looked at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut for a 16-man tournament at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, defeating Ivan Putski, Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat, and the Dynamite Kid before losing via countout in the finals to Junkyard Dog.

In late 1985, Savage started a feud with then-Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana over that title. During the November 2 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event III&quot;, he unsuccessfully challenged Santana for the title (Savage won the match by countout, but not the title because the title did not change hands by countout). In a rematch on WWF on NESN on February 8, 1986, he won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship at the Boston Garden by using an illegal steel object stashed in his tights to knock out Santana. Early in his WWF career, Savage also won three countout victories (the first at the Spectrum in Philadelphia and the other two at Madison Square Garden) over his future tag team partner WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan (although the belt did not change hands due to the countout) as well as engaging in feuds with Bruno Sammartino and George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele.

Savage&#x27;s feud with Steele began on the January 4 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IV&quot;, when Steele developed a crush on Miss Elizabeth. At WrestleMania 2 on April 7, 1986, Savage defeated Steele in a match to retain his Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. He resumed his feud with Steele in early 1987, culminating in two Intercontinental Heavyweight title matches, both won by Savage.
His next feud was with Ricky Steamboat, where in October, Savage crushed Steamboat&#x27;s throat against a guardrail. On March 29, 1987, Savage wrestled Steamboat at WrestleMania III in the Pontiac Silverdome. After 19 two-counts, Steamboat pinned Savage (with help from George Steele, who pushed Savage from the top rope seconds before he was pinned) to end his near 14-month reign as Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. The match was extremely choreographed, as opposed to the &quot;on the fly&quot; nature of most wrestling matches at the time; Savage was a stickler for detail, and he and Steamboat laid out and rehearsed every spot in the match prior to WrestleMania. The match was named 1987&#x27;s Match of the Year by both &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; and the &quot;Wrestling Observer&quot;. Steamboat and Savage were seen cheering with and hugging other wrestlers after the match. The two continued to feud on house shows, including in steel cage matches. During this part of his career, he became known for his stage costumes, which were created by Florida designer Michael Braun.

==== WWF Champion (1988–1989) ====

Savage won the King of the Ring tournament later in 1987. His popularity was rising to the point that he was being cheered by a majority of the fans despite being a heel, so he became less hostile towards the fans and Miss Elizabeth. When The Honky Tonk Man declared himself &quot;the greatest Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion of all time&quot;, Savage began a feud with him to get the title back, becoming a fan favorite in the process. On the October 3 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XII&quot;, he got his shot at The Honky Tonk Man and the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, but lost out on the title when The Hart Foundation (Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart and Jim &quot;The Anvil&quot; Neidhart), who along with Honky were managed by &quot;The Mouth of the South&quot; Jimmy Hart, interrupted the match, getting Honky disqualified. In the ensuing beatdown, Miss Elizabeth ran back to the locker room and brought Hulk Hogan out to the ring to save Savage, leading to the formation of &quot;The Mega Powers&quot;. Savage would lead a team of five against Honky&#x27;s team of five at the first annual Survivor Series on November 26, where Savage&#x27;s team was victorious, avenging Elizabeth&#x27;s honor. His feud with Honky continued into early 1988, where in their last high-profile matchup (aired as the undercard to Andre the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan on the February 5 episode of &quot;The Main Event I&quot;), Savage defeated Honky by count-out after he shoved Honky away from Elizabeth and into the ring post.

At WrestleMania IV on March 27, 1988, he participated in the 14-man tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship. During the tournament held at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, Savage defeated &quot;The Natural&quot; Butch Reed, Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine and the One Man Gang on his way to the finals, where he defeated &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase (who had André the Giant in his corner), pinning him with the help of Hogan. Savage retained the WWF World Heavyweight Title for a little over a year, defending it against the likes of One Man Gang, Big Boss Man and André the Giant.

The Mega Powers&#x27; first feud was against The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), whom they defeated on August 29 in the main event of the first ever SummerSlam pay-per-view. The match, refereed by Jesse Ventura, was famous for Miss Elizabeth jumping up on the apron of the ring late in the match and removing her skirt to show red panties. This allowed both Savage and Hogan (who had been knocked to the outside) to get back in the ring and get the pin on DiBiase with Savage pushing a reluctant Ventura to the 3-count. The Mega Powers then began feuding with The Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem who was formerly the One Man Gang). In the case of the latter feud, Savage frequently became involved in Hogan&#x27;s matches involving one of the two villains (and vice versa); the two rival factions captained opposing teams in the main event of the Survivor Series on November 24, which was won by the Mega Powers.
Problems between Savage and Hogan developed in early 1989 after Hogan also took Elizabeth as his manager. On January 15, 1989, at the Royal Rumble, Hogan accidentally eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match and they started to fight until Elizabeth separated them. During the February 3 episode of &quot;The Main Event II&quot;, Savage and Hogan faced the Twin Towers, but Elizabeth accidentally got injured at ringside. Hogan carried her to the back, which enraged Savage to the point that he abandoned Hogan later in the match. Savage and Hogan got into a heated argument with Savage declaring that Hogan was an inferior wrestler to him and that he wanted to steal Elizabeth from him. He then proceeded to attack his partner and attacked Hogan&#x27;s friend Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake as he tried to intervene, before being separated by security, turning Savage heel for the first time since 1987.

On April 2 at WrestleMania V, Savage dropped the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Hogan after a reign of 371 days. Prior to the match, Savage had actually been hospitalized with an infected elbow but checked himself out of the hospital in order to wrestle Hogan and despite wearing a heavy bandage over the elbow and being sick as a result of the infection, still managed to put on a high quality showing. Later that month, he replaced Elizabeth (who stayed with Hogan) as his manager with former WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Sensational Sherri. Savage co-main evented SummerSlam on August 28, teaming with &quot;The Human Wrecking Machine&quot; Zeus (actor Tiny Lister in character as his role from Hulk Hogan&#x27;s movie, &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;), against The Mega-Maniacs (Hogan and Brutus Beefcake), with the Mega-Maniacs winning after Hogan hit Zeus with Sherri&#x27;s loaded purse to get the win. Savage and Zeus faced Hogan and Beefcake in a rematch contested in a steel cage at No Holds Barred on December 27, but were again defeated.

==== Macho King and retirement (1989–1991) ====
Meanwhile, as all of this was going on, Savage decided to challenge Jim Duggan for the &quot;King of the Ring&quot; title in September 1989, defeating him; Savage began referring to himself as &quot;The Macho King&quot; going forward, with Sherri becoming known as &quot;Sensational Queen Sherri&quot;.

Savage and Hogan met one final time on February 23, 1990, at &quot;The Main Event III&quot;, with Hogan once again putting the WWF Championship on the line. The pinfall was counted by new heavyweight boxing champion Buster Douglas despite Savage kicking out at two, Douglas then punched Savage in the face after Savage confronted and then slapped Douglas.
Savage then began feuding with the &quot;Common Man&quot; Dusty Rhodes, losing a mixed tag match (along with Sherri) to Rhodes and Sapphire on April 1 at WrestleMania VI but beating him in a singles match on August 27 at SummerSlam.

After this, Savage started a feud with The Ultimate Warrior, who had defeated Hogan to win the WWF Championship at WrestleMania VI. Warrior repeatedly refused to give Savage a title shot, instead choosing to defend the championship against Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble in January 1991. Savage attacked Warrior as he was making his entrance, and then later in the match knocked him unconscious by breaking his royal scepter over Warrior&#x27;s head, costing him the championship.

Warrior responded by challenging Savage to a career-ending match at WrestleMania VII on March 24, where the loser of the contest would be forced to retire from professional wrestling. Savage lost the match, and was then attacked by Sherri as he lay dejected in the ring. This was too much for Miss Elizabeth, who happened to be in the audience, rushing to Savage&#x27;s aid, fighting off Sherri and reuniting with her one-time love to huge crowd appreciation, with Savage becoming a fan favorite once again for the first time since 1989.

Despite his retirement from active wrestling, Savage stayed in the WWF in a non-wrestling capacity while The Ultimate Warrior was fired by Vince McMahon after SummerSlam later that year. Savage wrestled a number of times following WrestleMania VII and the WWF&#x27;s official story was that out of respect, Warrior generously allowed him to see out the final months of his contract before he was forced to retire. His last match was on April 1 in Kobe, Japan at a joint card between the WWF and Super World Sports, where he was defeated by Genichiro Tenryu. He also made an initial, untelevised return to the ring on July 30 in Portland, Maine, at a &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping when he substituted for The Ultimate Warrior and pinned The Undertaker. Following this, Savage subbed for Warrior on house shows in early August against Undertaker.

==== Color commentator, reinstatement and departure (1991–1994) ====

The storyline with Miss Elizabeth continued, culminating with Savage proposing to her in the ring leading to an on-air wedding on August 26 at SummerSlam dubbed &quot;The Match Made in Heaven&quot;. It was at this time that Savage was targeted by the now-villain Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts. On an episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; prior to SummerSlam, the announcers and several wrestlers threw a &quot;bachelor party&quot; for Savage, with Roberts&#x27; arrival deemed unwelcome by the rest of the contingent.

In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts and his new ally, The Undertaker, made their presence known by hiding a live snake in one of the newly married couple&#x27;s wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened when she opened the gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn while Roberts pulled the snake from the box and menaced Elizabeth with it. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to The Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. During a television taping for &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; on November 23, Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm. According to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD, the snake was holding on with the fangs and Jake had a hard time getting the snake off Randy. With help from the fans, Savage was later reinstated by Tunney, who announced a match between Savage and Roberts for This Tuesday in Texas on December 3, where Savage defeated Roberts, however, Roberts performed the &quot;DDT&quot; on Savage three times after the match, and things came to a head when Roberts slapped Miss Elizabeth. The feud continued throughout the winter, ending after a match on the February 8, 1992 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot;, which Savage won.

Savage then began an on-screen feud with WWF Champion Ric Flair, who claimed that he had been in a prior relationship with Savage&#x27;s wife Miss Elizabeth, going as far as presenting pictures of Elizabeth and Flair together. This culminated in a title match between the two on April 5 at WrestleMania VIII; Savage won the match and his second WWF Championship. During this time, Savage and Elizabeth separated in real life, however, the Savage-Flair feud continued, and &quot;WWF Magazine&quot; published photos of Savage and Elizabeth, which were identical to those featuring Elizabeth and Flair; it was revealed that Flair had doctored the Savage-Elizabeth pictures. The former couple were divorced on September 18, and a statement announcing the divorce appeared in &quot;WWF Magazine&quot; at about the same time, a rare break of kayfabe for the WWF at the time.

For the better part of 1992, Savage and his old nemesis The Ultimate Warrior (who returned to the WWF at WrestleMania VIII) peacefully co-existed. However, when it was announced that Warrior was the new number-one contender for Savage&#x27;s WWF Championship, old tensions resurfaced and they had several heated exchanges prior to the match. On August 29 (transmitted on pay-per-view TV August 31), Savage defended the title against The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam. WWF writers had originally intended that Warrior should be the one to accept Mr. Perfect&#x27;s services - up for offer to either Summerslam main event competitor - turning heel in the process of winning the title and continuing his feud with the dethroned Savage, now the babyface in their rivalry. However these plans were scrapped at a late stage due to the Warrior&#x27;s refusal to turn heel after considering the collapse in merchandise sales which would have resulted. Instead, Savage lost the match by countout, after having his knee injured by Flair and Mr. Perfect, but retained the championship. After the match, Warrior helped a badly injured Savage to the back. On the September 14 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; (taped September 1), Savage lost the WWF Championship to Flair after interference from Razor Ramon.

He then formed a tag team with Warrior known as the &quot;Ultimate Maniacs&quot;, and after his title loss shortly after, an injured Savage backed Warrior to dethrone Flair. On the November 8, 1992 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXI&quot;, they took on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Money Inc. lost by countout but retained their titles. Savage and Warrior were to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series on November 25. Warrior was fired from the WWF weeks before the event, so Savage chose Mr. Perfect, executive consultant to Flair, as his partner to replace Warrior. Perfect initially laughed off the suggestion, but was angered by Bobby Heenan and his insinuations that he could never again wrestle at his previous level, and accepted the match. The duo defeated Flair and Ramon via disqualification.

When &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; began in January 1993, Savage served primarily as a color commentator. On January 24, he was the runner up in the Royal Rumble match at Royal Rumble, where he was eliminated by Yokozuna. Savage returned to pay-per-view on November 24 at Survivor Series as a substitute for Mr. Perfect. He also competed in the 1994 Royal Rumble match on January 22, but was eliminated by Crush, leading to a Falls Count Anywhere match on March 20 at WrestleMania X, where Savage defeated Crush. Savage also made periodic appearances in Jim Cornette&#x27;s Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion in May and made his final WWF pay-per-view appearance on August 29 at SummerSlam, where he served as the master of ceremonies. Savage&#x27;s final WWF match was a tour in Germany when he teamed with Bret Hart to defeat Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart on September 13, 1994, in Rostock. At the end of October 1994, Savage&#x27;s WWF contract expired and he left to sign with rival World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

=== World Championship Wrestling (1994–2000) ===

==== The Mega Powers reunion (1994–1995) ====
Savage made his first appearance for WCW on the December 3, 1994 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, referencing the love/hate relationship he had with Hulk Hogan and stated his desire to be the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. He appeared at Starrcade on December 27, saving Hogan from an attack by The Three Faces of Fear, shaking hands with his friend and rival. At SuperBrawl V on February 19, 1995, Savage and Sting defeated Avalanche and Big Bubba Rogers. On March 19 at Uncensored, Savage defeated Avalanche via disqualification when a fan, who happened to be Ric Flair dressed in drag, attacked Savage. This led to a feud between Savage and Flair, where, on May 21, Flair attacked Savage&#x27;s father, Angelo Poffo, at Slamboree following the main event where Savage and Hogan defeated Flair and Vader.

Savage participated in the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship tournament, defeating The Butcher in the first round and &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin in the quarterfinals. He then interfered in Flair&#x27;s match against Alex Wright, attacking Flair and causing Wright to get disqualified, which set up a tournament semi-final in which the winner would face the winner of the Sting and Meng match for the title at The Great American Bash. Savage and Flair&#x27;s tournament semi-final match never took place, however, due to Savage and Flair brawling in the backstage area prior to the match and both being eliminated from the tournament. At the event on June 18, Savage lost to Flair after Flair stole Angelo&#x27;s cane and hit Savage with it. In a rematch on July 16, Savage defeated Flair in a lifeguard lumberjack match at Bash at the Beach. Later that year, during part of the storyline in which Arn Anderson and Ric Flair turned on each other, Flair (looking for a partner to take on Anderson and Brian Pillman in a tag match) tried to recruit Savage to be his partner. Remembering the rivalry (and how Flair had attacked Savage&#x27;s father), Savage refused. At Fall Brawl on September 17, Savage, Hogan, Lex Luger and Sting defeated The Dungeon of Doom (Kamala, The Zodiac, The Shark and Meng) in a WarGames match. On October 29 at Halloween Havoc, Savage defeated Luger.

==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1995–1996) ====
At World War 3 on November 26, Savage won his first WCW World Heavyweight Championship by winning the first-ever 60-man three-ring battle royal. On December 27, he lost the title to Flair at Starrcade; earlier that night, he defeated Hiroyoshi Tenzan. Savage won his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship back from Flair on the January 22, 1996 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. During this time, Savage brought Elizabeth with him into WCW as his manager once again. At SuperBrawl VI on February 11, Savage defended the title against Flair in steel cage match, however, he lost the title after Elizabeth turned on Savage when she allowed Flair to hit him with one of her high heel shoes. Flair claimed that Elizabeth gave him a sizable amount of Savage&#x27;s money, taken in their divorce settlement, which he used to set up a &quot;VIP section&quot; at &quot;Nitro&quot; events.

At Uncensored on March 24, Savage and Hogan won a Doomsday Cage match against Flair, Arn Anderson, Meng, The Barbarian, Luger, The Taskmaster, Z-Gangsta and The Ultimate Solution. On May 19 at Slamboree, Savage and Flair were paired in the Lord of the Ring tournament, where they defeated Anderson and Eddie Guerrero, but lost to Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock) by forfeit after Savage attacked Flair during his entrance as a retribution for Flair&#x27;s attack on Savage in their earlier match. At Bash at the Beach on July 7, the New World Order (nWo) was formed when Hulk Hogan turned on Savage, Sting, and Lex Luger and joined &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, a tag team of former WWF wrestlers Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. After their inception, one of their main enemies became Savage himself, who was one of the leaders of the WCW crusaders against the nWo. Savage threatened Hogan for months, often being attacked by the nWo. On September 15 at Fall Brawl, Savage was defeated by The Giant. At Halloween Havoc on October 27, Savage finally faced Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but lost when The Giant interfered and hit him with a chokeslam. Savage left WCW following the event, as he was unable to reach a new deal with the company.

==== New World Order (1997–1998) ====

Savage returned to WCW on the January 20, 1997 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; hijacking the show, claiming to have been &quot;blackballed&quot; and refusing to leave the ring until Sting showed up, and the two left together. Savage appeared again with Sting over the next couple &quot;Nitro&quot; shows roving and watching events from the crowd as &quot;free agents&quot;. At one point, WCW president and nWo member Eric Bischoff informed Savage that his WCW career was over and he could only return as an nWo member. On February 23, Sting and Savage appeared at SuperBrawl VII, where Savage left Sting&#x27;s side and joined the nWo by helping Hogan defeat Roddy Piper. The next night, he reunited with Elizabeth, who had joined the nWo several months earlier during Savage&#x27;s hiatus from WCW. Savage began feuding with Diamond Dallas Page and his wife Kimberly. On March 16 at Uncensored, Savage won a Triangle Elimination match with the nWo. He lost to Page in a no disqualification match on April 6 at Spring Stampede, but defeated him in a falls count anywhere match on June 15 at The Great American Bash, as well as in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach on July 13. At Road Wild on August 9, Savage lost to the Giant, and on September 14 at Fall Brawl, Savage and Scott Hall lost to Page and Luger. Their feud ended in a Las Vegas Death match on October 26 at Halloween Havoc, which Savage won.

On January 24, 1998, at Souled Out, Savage lost to Luger. Luger also won a rematch between the two on February 22 at SuperBrawl VIII. Savage faced Hogan in a steel cage match at Uncensored on March 15, which ended in a no contest. When Hogan failed to recapture his &quot;nWo&quot; title from Sting, it was Savage&#x27;s turn, and he got his shot on April 19 at Spring Stampede. Hogan tried to make sure that Savage would not win the title because Hogan felt that he was the only nWo member who should be WCW World Heavyweight Champion, since he was the leader of the stable. With the help of Nash, however, Savage beat Sting for his third WCW World Heavyweight Championship, despite tearing his ACL in his knee during the match. The following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hogan faced Savage for the championship, and it looked like Hogan had Savage beat, but for the second consecutive night, Nash came to Savage&#x27;s aid, powerbombing Hogan. However, an interfering Bret Hart attacked Savage and preserved the victory for Hogan. Savage then joined with Nash and others to form the nWo Wolfpac, a split from Hogan&#x27;s group.

At Slamboree on May 17, Savage lost to Hart by submission. On June 14 at The Great American Bash, Savage teamed up with Piper against and lost to Hogan and Hart by submission. After the match, Savage wrestled Piper in the next match, which Savage quickly lost to Piper by submission. After the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Savage took a hiatus from the company to recover from at least two major knee surgeries. He made only one more appearance in 1998, helping Ric Flair defeat Eric Bischoff for the Presidency of WCW on the December 28 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. As nWo member the Giant was interfering on Bischoff&#x27;s behalf, Savage entered the ring wearing an nWo shirt but duped, low-blowed and clotheslined the Giant out of the ring and removed the shirt while exiting.

==== Team Madness (1999–2000) ====

Savage returned in April 1999, debuting a new look and theme music, sporting a slicked-back ponytail, earrings, and a new villainous attitude (though still embracing the fans), as well as introducing his new valet, Gorgeous George. His first action was as the guest referee in the main event at Spring Stampede on April 11, which was won by Diamond Dallas Page. For a short time afterward, Savage interfered in DDP&#x27;s matches to make sure that Page kept the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but when Kevin Nash won it on May 9 at Slamboree, Savage went after the title himself. It was around that time that Madusa and Miss Madness joined Savage as his other two valets; together they were known as Team Madness. On June 13 at The Great American Bash, Sid Vicious returned to WCW and helped Savage to attack Kevin Nash.

This led to a tag team match on July 11 at Bash at the Beach between Nash and Sting against Savage and Sid Vicious, in which whoever scored the winning fall would win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship; Savage won his fourth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship when he pinned Nash. Savage&#x27;s last reign as champion did not last long, as he lost the title to a returning Hollywood Hogan the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, when Nash interfered and hit a powerbomb on Savage (in a reversal of the situation from the previous year, in which Nash had attacked Hogan to help Savage keep his title, albeit unsuccessfully). Team Madness slowly started to disband, after Madusa and Miss Madness began fighting each other over who was responsible for Savage&#x27;s title loss. Savage soon fired both of them and started a feud with Dennis Rodman, defeating him at Road Wild on August 14.

Savage disappeared from WCW programming following his feud with Rodman and would make two more appearances: first on the October 25, 1999 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, when he appeared in the ring with Gorgeous George and talked about passing the torch forward. His second, and final, WCW appearance would be on the May 3, 2000, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, when Savage returned to join The Millionaire&#x27;s Club – a group consisting of Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and other veterans – aiding them at the end of a 41-man battle royal. Despite Savage ending the show claiming he was going to help the veteran group take out young New Blood group, he did not appear again in WCW before they folded the next year.

=== NWA: Total Nonstop Action (2004) ===
On November 7, 2004, Savage returned to professional wrestling at NWA: Total Nonstop Action&#x27;s (TNA) Victory Road pay-per-view, confronting Jeff Jarrett. He made his &quot;Impact!&quot; debut on November 19, confronting the Kings of Wrestling (Jarrett, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall). At the end of the next week&#x27;s show, he led a group attack on them. On December 5, at Turning Point, Savage, Jeff Hardy and A.J. Styles defeated them in his last match. Savage never signed a contract with TNA, instead working on a per date handshake deal.

== Other media ==
=== Endorsements ===
He was the celebrity spokesman for Slim Jim snack foods in the mid-to-late 1990s. His catch phrase in the ads was &quot;Snap into a Slim Jim, oooooh yeah!&quot;, which became a recurring theme for Slim Jim ads. In 1998, Savage accepted an award from Harvard University&#x27;s humor society Harvard Lampoon as &quot;Man of the Year&quot;.

=== Acting career ===
Savage appeared in many television shows in the mid-to-late &#x27;90s. He appeared on a wrestling-themed episode of &quot;Baywatch&quot; that aired in 1996 with fellow WCW wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Big Van Vader, and Kevin Sullivan. In 1999, he appeared on popular television shows &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot;.

Savage appeared in his first theatrical film in 2000 making an appearance as his Macho Man character in the movie &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; where David Arquette daydreams a sequence fighting Savage at a gas station. Savage&#x27;s most famous film role was in the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot; as the wrestler Bonesaw McGraw (based on the comics character Crusher Hogan).

Savage&#x27;s memorable voice gave him voice acting roles for various television and film projects. He voiced the rogue alien wrestler &quot;Rasslor&quot; in the &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; shorts &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot;. He also provided his voice in many other shows including the voice for &quot;Gorilla&quot; in an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and the voice of Space Ghost&#x27;s grandfather in an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. Savage served as the voice of &quot;The Thug&quot; in Disney&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated 2008 animated film &quot;Bolt&quot;, which was his last theatrical film appearance. Savage reprised the role in &quot;Super Rhino&quot; in 2009 for the short film featuring the cast of &quot;Bolt&quot;.

=== Filmography ===
=== Music ===
Savage&#x27;s music debut was on the WWF-produced &quot;&quot; in 1993, where he sang on the song &quot;Speaking from the Heart&quot;, one of many songs sung by then-WWF wrestlers on the CD.

On October 7, 2003, Savage released his debut rap album titled &quot;Be a Man&quot;. It includes a tribute song to &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; Curt Hennig, as well as a diss track aimed at Hulk Hogan. Savage promoted &quot;Be a Man&quot; with a concert tour featuring Brian Adams as his bodyguard and Ron Harris as touring manager. During this time, the development of a second album was already in progress with Savage exclaiming, &quot;We are absolutely going to have more records.&quot; However, no further albums were released.

Just three months before his death on February 2, 2011, EpicLLOYD and Nice Peter made a song along with a video for &quot;Epic Rap Battles of History&quot; of Hulk Hogan, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage and Kim Jong-Il having a rap battle. They noted his death with annotations in the video.

Rapper Don Trip released a mixtape on January 24, 2014, entitled &quot;Randy Savage&quot;. All tracks have Savage&#x27;s famous &quot;Ohhh Yeah!!!&quot; in the opening of the song; the track entitled &quot;Cream of the Crop&quot; has Savage&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Means Nothing&quot; speech from an interview after WrestleMania III. In January 2015, DJ/rapper DJ Cummerbund began releasing a series of remixes that feature samples from &quot;Be a Man&quot; which has received critical acclaim.

=== Video games ===
Savage appeared in &quot;WWF WrestleMania&quot;, &quot;WWF WrestleMania Challenge&quot;, &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;, &quot;WWF WrestleMania: Steel Cage Challenge&quot;, &quot;WWF Super WrestleMania&quot;, &quot;WWF Royal Rumble&quot;, &quot;WWF King of the Ring&quot;, &quot;WCW vs nWo: World Tour&quot;, &quot;WCW Nitro&quot;, &quot;WCW/nWo Revenge&quot;, &quot;WCW/nWo Thunder&quot;, &quot;WCW Mayhem&quot;, &quot;WWE All Stars&quot;, as a DLC in &quot;WWE 12&quot; and as an unlockable character in &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;. He appears as the Macho King as a DLC in &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;, in &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; as a starting wrestler, in &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K18&quot; as an unlockable wrestler through the in-game currency &quot;VC&quot; (Virtual Currency), and &quot;WWE 2K19&quot; as an exclusive DLC character for the Collector&#x27;s edition of the game, entitled the &quot;Wooooo!&quot; Edition, &quot;WWE 2K20&quot; as an unlockable character through the game&#x27;s currency, &quot;WWE 2K Battlegrounds&quot; as a post-launch DLC character, and is also an unlockable character in &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K23&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot; as a crossover.

Savage&#x27;s 16 plus year absence from WWE-licensed games from 1994&#x27;s &quot;WWF Raw&quot; to 2011&#x27;s &quot;WWE All Stars&quot; was recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in its 2015 gamer&#x27;s edition as the longest such absence.

== Personal life ==
Savage met Elizabeth Hulette, better known as Miss Elizabeth, at a gym in Lexington in 1982, and they married in 1984. They divorced in 1992. On May 10, 2010, Savage married Barbara Lynn Payne, whom he had previously dated in the early 1970s.

For years, Savage and Hulk Hogan were at odds and had an on again/off again friendship. He had a dog named Hercules, a German Shepherd that was given to him by Hercules Hernandez.

== Death ==
On the morning of May 20, 2011, Savage was driving his Jeep Wrangler near his home in Seminole, Florida, with his wife in the passenger seat when he became unresponsive and crashed into a tree. Paramedics arrived soon after and found him dead at the scene, aged 58. Savage and his wife had been wearing seatbelts. She suffered only minor physical injuries in the crash. An autopsy performed by the medical examiner&#x27;s office found that he had an enlarged heart and advanced coronary artery disease (more than 90% narrowed) which had resulted in a sudden heart attack. The drugs found in his system included a prescription painkiller and a small amount of alcohol. Savage had never been treated for heart problems and there was no evidence that he was aware of his heart condition. The cause of death was officially ruled as atherosclerotic heart disease.

Five days after his death, Savage was cremated, and his ashes were placed under a favorite tree on his property in Largo, Florida, near his mother&#x27;s development. Ten days before his death, he had asked his brother to pour the ashes of his dog in the same spot. When Savage&#x27;s brother asked why, Savage stated that it was because he wanted him to remember that spot, since he wanted his ashes to be poured there as well.

==Legacy==

Vince McMahon, with whom Savage had a longtime strained relationship, paid tribute to Savage in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, describing Savage as &quot;one of wrestling&#x27;s all-time greats&quot;. TNA held a ten bell salute in Savage&#x27;s honor the night of his death. WWE aired a tribute video on the May 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Later that night, CM Punk paid tribute to Savage by wearing pink trunks and yellow boots complete with white stars on the trunks during a tag team match with R-Truth against John Cena and Rey Mysterio. Punk later adapted a version of the diving elbow drop into his moveset.

In August 2011, Kevin Eck of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; lauded Savage as an all-round performer, saying that &quot;nobody blended power, speed, agility, and technical skills like the &#x27;Macho Man&#x27; in his prime&quot;.

WWE released a DVD documentary, &quot;Macho Man: The Randy Savage Story&quot;, in November 2014. Despite a strained relationship over the years with the WWE, the documentary featured interviews with Savage&#x27;s brother, Lanny Poffo and his mother, with Poffo giving insight to many of the rumors and denying some of the negative things other wrestlers said in the documentary about Savage, including his relationship with Elizabeth. Savage was never inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame during his lifetime and he was frequently described as being one of its most noticeably absent figures.

On January 12, 2015, WWE announced Savage as the first inductee to the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015, and that his Mega Powers partner and long-time rival Hulk Hogan would induct him. Lanny Poffo, Savage&#x27;s brother, accepted the honor on Randy&#x27;s behalf by reading a poem. Later on the WWE Network that same night Lanny commented, &quot;I had no thoughts. I was so excited. Intellectually, there was nothing. It was all emotional. I was happy for the fans. They waited for Bruno Sammartino for so many years and now they waited for Macho Man.&quot; He went on to say that Savage&#x27;s mother and his 30-year-old daughter are both very excited and said of the WWE Network, &quot;Randy will never die.&quot; Vince McMahon reached out to Savage back in 2010, wanting to induct only him in the Hall of Fame, but Savage refused to go in without his father and his brother.

On September 1, 2018, at the event All In, Jay Lethal was accompanied to the ring by Lanny Poffo, while dressed in one of Savage&#x27;s original outfits.

Savage is a subject of &quot;The Match Made in Heaven&quot;, the first episode of Viceland&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;, that premiered on April 10, 2019.

On July 28, 2023, the Dutchess County, New York, Legislature declared July 6 as &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage Day in honor of his WWF debut on television at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center on July 6, 1985.

On September 26, 2023, the train overpass on Linden Avenue in the city of Zanesville, Ohio was renamed in honor of the late Randy Savage. The overpass sits directly to the north of the Y-Bridge.

<text>Agadez (Air Tamajeq: ⴰⴶⴰⴷⴰⵣ, &quot;Agadaz&quot;), formerly spelled Agadès, is the fifth largest city in Niger, with a population of 110,497 based on the 2012 census. The capital of the eponymous Agadez Region, the city lies in the Sahara desert, and is also the capital of Aïr, one of the traditional Tuareg–Berber federations. The historic centre of the town has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==History==

Agadez was founded before the 14th century, and, by growing around trans-Saharan trade, gradually became the most important city of the Tuareg people, supplanting Assodé. The city still sees the arrival of caravans bringing salt from Bilma.

In 1449 Agadez became a sultanate, but was later conquered by the Songhai Empire in 1515, remaining a part of that empire until 1591. At this point, the city had a population of around 30,000 people. By then, the city was a key passage for the medieval caravans trading between the West African cities of Kano (the source of the Hausa language which is the traditional lingua franca of different ethnic groups in the city, especially in the area of trade, religion and administration) and Timbuktu, and the North African oases of Ghat, Ghadames, and Tripoli, on the Mediterranean shore. Internal fighting led to the gradual decline of the sultanate, and by the mid-19th century the town was a shadow of its former self.

Some contend that Agadez was the furthermost extent of the Ottoman Empire on the African continent until the 19th century, before being occupied by the French colonial empire, though this claim has not been verified by historians. The city was ruled by the French from 1906. A rebellion by Kaocen Ag Mohammed occurred in 1916, but was defeated by French forces. The French, unable to effectively administer this remote region, ruled semi-indirectly via a restored sultan. Later, Agadez became an important location in the Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s in central and northern Niger.

===2007 violence===
As a result of the Second Tuareg Rebellion, sporadic violence and the displacement of thousands of people affected the Agadez area from late 2007 into 2009. All of northern Niger was placed on the United States State Department list of areas which are unsafe for travel by United States citizens, covering late 2007 to the end of 2008. Tourist flights to Agadez were suspended by European airlines for the 2007–2008 tourist season (September – March). The burgeoning tourist industry, which prior to 2007 had surpassed that of Niamey and the rest of the nation, essentially came to an end. The entire region was placed under a Nigerien government &quot;State of Exception&quot; (limiting travel, gatherings, political activities, etc.) in October 2007, renewed through early 2009. Roads to and from Agadez were reported to have been mined, and the government closed the area to international journalists and aid organizations. An unknown number (reported as several thousands) of internally displaced people converged on the city as a result of the unrest.

===Emigration towards Europe===
In the 2010s, Agadez became a major transit town for West African migrants heading to Libya and then on to Europe, since Agadez is the final stop before passing through the long trek across the Sahara towards the Libyan coast. Crackdowns in 2016 slowed the flow of migrants, but recent Displacement Tracking Matrix data showed a daily average of 1,212 individuals crossing at six monitored points in Niger, many of whom would have been coming through Agadez. The city now hosts hundreds of migrants living in small houses on the outskirts of the city before moving on to Libya.

== Demographics ==
==Culture and tourism==

Today, Agadez flourishes as a market town and as a centre for the transportation of the uranium mined in the surrounding area. Notable buildings in the city include the Agadez Grand Mosque (originally dating from 1515 but rebuilt in the same style in 1844), the Kaocen Palace (now a hotel), and the Agadez Sultan&#x27;s Palace. The city is also known for its camel market and its silver and leatherwork. Its name is given to a form of Tuareg symbolic jewellery, the Agadez Cross.

Some well-known musicians from the town include Tuareg guitar player Bombino and his band Group Bombino, and Group Inerane. Mdou Moctar&#x27;s film, &quot;Akounak Teggdalit Taha Tazoughai&quot;, is set and filmed on location in Agadez.

==Airport and military usage==

Agadez&#x27;s air transport hub, Mano Dayak International Airport, was named after Mano Dayak, the Tuareg leader who is native to the region.

The United States built Nigerien Air Base 201, a dedicated drone airbase in Agadez from which it can more easily monitor terrorist activities in West and North Africa, and the Sahel. It was revealed in 2016 that the military base in Niger cost the U.S. $100 million.

== Air pollution ==
Air pollution, including particulate matter and dust, poses significant health risks due to their microscopic size and potential inhalation into the deepest parts of the lung.

==Climate==
Agadez has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;).

<doc id="552906" wikidata="Q2964833" url="?curid=552906" title="Chris Pearson (politician)">
<text>Christopher William Pearson (April 29, 1931 – February 14, 2014) was the second leader of the Yukon Progressive Conservative Party and the first premier of the Yukon in the Yukon.

Born in Lethbridge, Alberta, Pearson moved to the Yukon in 1957 and worked for the government from 1960 until 1973 when he entered private business. Prior to 1978, the territory had a non-partisan legislature with no individual acting as leader of the government or Premier.

==Career==
Pearson was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1978 election. He was not the party&#x27;s leader going into the election campaign, but was chosen as government leader because of the defeat of leader Hilda Watson in her own riding. He became the leader of the Yukon Territory Progressive Conservative Party on December 8, 1978, when Watson resigned as leader. Pearson led the Yukon&#x27;s first party government until his resignation in 1985.

Pearson&#x27;s government opposed transboundary native land claims and argued that the territory should be a party to the Yukon land claims negotiations. The government also fought for greater responsible government in the territory, for granting the territory more say over its natural resources, and for the territory to be a full participant in federal-provincial conferences rather than just an observer. The government successfully obtained the transfer of a number of powers from the federally appointed commissioner of the territory to the government.

In 1982 the Pearson government was re-elected with a majority and attempted to deal with the effects of the economic recession on the territory which was exacerbated by the collapse of the hard mining industry and the closure of the Faro Mine.

Pearson left politics in 1985 but his successor, Willard Phelps, was not able to turn the government&#x27;s fortunes around. The Yukon New Democratic Party won that year&#x27;s election and formed government.

Pearson served as deputy consul general at the Canadian Consulate in Dallas, Texas, before moving to the New River Valley of Virginia in 1990. He died on February 14, 2014, in Claytor Lake.

<text>Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (born 17 August 1941) is a Nigerian statesman and military dictator who ruled as military president of Nigeria from 1985 when he orchestrated a coup d&#x27;état against his military and political arch-rival Muhammadu Buhari, until his resignation in 1993 as a result of the crisis of the Third Republic.

He rose through the ranks of the Nigerian Army fighting in the Nigerian Civil War and at various times being involved in almost all the military coups in Nigeria, before advancing to the rank of a General and ultimately as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces; and as an unelected President and military dictator from 1985 to 1993, ruling for an uninterrupted period of eight years. His years in power, colloquially known as the &quot;Babangida Era&quot;, are considered one of the most controversial in Nigerian political and military history, being characterized by a burgeoning political culture of corruption in Nigeria, with Babangida and his regime estimated to have misappropriated at least 12 billion dollars (23.9 billion today).

The Babangida regime oversaw the establishment of a state security apparatus; survived two coup d&#x27;ètat attempts and the subsequent execution of Mamman Vatsa (1985) and Gideon Orkar (1990) alongside the trial of hundreds of soldiers. The Babangida era also witnessed the assassination in Lagos of a prominent journalist named Dele Giwa (1986). The regime also faced a series of ethnic and religious outbreaks related to the fallout of Babangida&#x27;s decision to increase cooperation with the Muslim world and rise in extremist tendencies. On the continent, his rule projected the country as a regional power with diplomatic successes including the Abuja Treaty and the military engagement of Nigerian troops in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Abroad, Babangida&#x27;s military regime cemented traditional relations with the English-speaking world of the United States and the United Kingdom; and implemented economic liberalization and the privatization of state-owned enterprises alongside a national mass mobilization. The fall of Babangida and his regime was precipitated by the transition toward the Third Nigerian Republic and the subsequent militarization of politics in the 1993 presidential election which he annulled.

==Early life==
Ibrahim Babangida was born on 17 August 1941 in Minna by Muhammad and Aisha Babangida. He received early Islamic education before attending primary school from 1950 to 1956. From 1957 to 1962 Babangida attended Government College Bida, together with classmates Abdulsalami Abubakar, Mamman Vatsa, Mohammed Magoro, Sani Bello, Garba Duba, Gado Nasko and Mohammed Sani Sami.
Babangida joined the Nigerian Army on 10 December 1962, where he attended the Nigerian Military Training College in Kaduna. Babangida received his commission as a second lieutenant as a regular combatant officer in the Royal Nigerian Army (a month before it became the Nigerian Army) with the personal army number N/438 from the Indian Military Academy on 26 September 1963. Babangida attended the Indian Military Academy from April to September 1963.

He was Commanding Officer of 1 Reconnaissance Squadron from 1964 to 1966. From January 1966 to April 1966, Babangida attended the Younger Officers Course at the Royal Armoured Centre in the United Kingdom – where he received instruction in gunnery and the Saladin armored car. Lieutenant Babangida was posted with the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron in Kaduna, and witnessed the events of the bloody coup d&#x27;état of 1966, which resulted in the assassination of Sir Ahmadu Bello. Alongside several young officers from Northern Nigeria, he took part in the July counter-coup led by Murtala Mohammed which ousted General Aguiyi Ironsi replacing him with General Yakubu Gowon.

==Military career==
===Civil war===
Following the outbreak of the civil war, Babangida was recalled and posted to the 1st Division under the command of General Mohammed Shuwa. In 1968, he became commander of the 44 Infantry Battalion which was involved in heavy fighting within Biafran territory. In 1969, during a reconnaissance operation from Enugu to Umuahia, the battalion came under heavy enemy fire and Babangida was shot on the right side of his chest. He was then hospitalized in Lagos, and was given the option of removing the bullet shrapnel, which he refused and still carries with him. Away and recovering from his wounds, Babangida married Maryam King on 6 September 1969. He returned to the war front in December 1969, commanding a battalion. In January 1970, Babangida was informed by his sectional commander General Theophilus Danjuma of the capitulation of the Biafran Army to the federal military government in Lagos, signaling the end of the war.

===After the war===
In 1970, following the war Babangida was promoted twice and posted to the Nigerian Defence Academy as an instructor. From August 1972 to June 1973, he attended the Advanced Armoured Officers Course at the United States Army Armor School. In 1973, he was made commander of the 4 Reconnaissance Regiment. In 1975, he became the commander of the Nigerian Army Armoured Corps. Babangida attended several defence and strategy courses. Colonel Babangida as Commander of the Armoured Corps was a key participant in the coup d&#x27;état of 1975.

He was later appointed as one of the youngest members of the Supreme Military Council from 1 August 1975 to October 1979. Colonel Babangida crushed almost single-handedly the coup d&#x27;état of 1976 that resulted in the assassination of General Murtala Mohammed by taking back control of the Radio Nigeria station from the main perpetrator, Lieutenant Colonel Buka Suka Dimka. From January 1977 to July 1977, he attended the Senior Officers Course at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji. From 1979 to 1980, he attended the Senior Executive Course at the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies.

===Army Staff Headquarters===
Babangida was the Director of Army Staff Duties and Plans from 1981 to 1983. He was the main figure behind the coup d&#x27;ètat of 1983 which led to the overthrow of the Second Republic, with financial backing from his close associate and businessman Moshood Abiola. Babangida alongside his other co-conspirators later appointed the most senior serving officer at the time General Muhammadu Buhari as military head of state from 1983 to 1985; and Babangida was promoted and appointed as Chief of Army Staff and member of the Supreme Military Council.

==Coup d&#x27;état of 1985==
===Planning===
Following the coup d&#x27;état of 1983, General Babangida (then Chief of Army Staff) started scheming to overthrow military head of state General Muhammadu Buhari. The palace coup of 1985 was orchestrated with a degree of military deftness hitherto not seen in the history of coup plotting. The whole affair carried out by Babangida as ringleader was planned at the highest levels of the army cultivating his strategic relationship with allies: Sani Abacha, Aliyu Gusau, Halilu Akilu, Mamman Vatsa, Gado Nasko, and younger officers from his days as an instructor in the military academy (graduates of the NDA&#x27;s Regular Course 3), and gradually positioned his allies within the echelons of military hierarchy.

===Execution===
The execution of the palace coup was initially delayed due to General Tunde Idiagbon the 6th Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters, and ruthless second-in-command to General Muhammadu Buhari. At midnight on 27 August 1985, the plot metamorphosed with four Majors: Sambo Dasuki, Abubakar Dangiwa Umar, Lawan Gwadabe, and Abdulmumini Aminu detailed to arrest the head of state. By daybreak, the conspirators had taken over the government and Babangida flew into Lagos from Minna where he was announced as the new commander-in-chief in a radio broadcast by General Sani Abacha. Babangida justified the coup in a speech describing General Muhammadu Buhari&#x27;s military regime as &quot;too rigid&quot;.

===Promulgation===
Babangida ruling by decree promulgated his official title as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and placed Muhammadu Buhari under house arrest in Benin until 1988. He established the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) as the highest law-making council serving as chairman; he also restructured the national security apparatus, tasking General Aliyu Gusau as Co-ordinator of National Security directly reporting to him in the president&#x27;s office he created the: State Security Service (SSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).

==Presidency==
Shortly after coming to power General Babangida established the Nigerian Political Bureau of 1986. The bureau was inaugurated to conduct a national debate on the political future of Nigeria, and was charged amongst other things to:The exercise was the broadest political consultation conducted in Nigerian history.

Between 1983 and 1985, the country suffered an economic crisis. In 1986, Babangida launched the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), with support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to restructure the Nigerian economy. In 1987, Babangida launched the Mass Mobilization for Self Reliance, Social Justice and Economic Recovery (MAMSER), following a recommendation from the Political Bureau, to increase self-reliance and economic recovery. The policies involved in the SAP and MAMSER were:
*deregulation of the agricultural sector to include the abolition of marketing boards and elimination of price controls
*privatisation of public enterprises
*devaluation of the Nigerian naira to improve the competitiveness of the export sector
* relaxation of restraints on foreign investment put in place by the Gowon and Obasanjo governments during the 1970s.
*re-orient Nigerians to shun waste and vanity, promoting economic recovery
*shed all pretences of affluence in their lifestyle, promoting self-reliance
*propagate the need to eschew all vices in public life, including corruption, dishonesty, electoral and census malpractices, ethnic and religious bigotry, promoting social justice
Between 1986 and 1988, these policies were executed as intended by the IMF, and the Nigerian economy actually did grow as had been hoped, with the export sector performing especially well. But falling real wages in the public sector and among the urban classes, along with a drastic reduction in expenditure on public services, set off waves of rioting and other manifestations of discontent that made a sustained commitment to the SAP difficult to maintain.

Babangida contributed to the development of national infrastructure. He finished the construction of the Third Mainland Bridge, the largest bridge on the continent at the time. His administration also saw the completion of the dualising of the Kaduna-Kano highway. Babangida also completed the Shiroro Hydroelectric Power Station. He had the Toja Bridge in Kebbi constructed. He also created the Jibia Water Treatment Plant and the Challawa Cenga Dam in Kano. Babangida also founded the Federal Road Safety Corps in order to better manage the national roads. On 23 September 1987, Babangida created two states: Akwa Ibom State and Katsina State. On 27 August 1991, Babangida created nine more states: Abia, Enugu, Delta, Jigawa, Kebbi, Osun, Kogi, Taraba, and Yobe. Bringing the total number of states in Nigeria to thirty in 1991. Babangida also increased the share of oil royalties and rents to states of origin from 1.5 to 3 percent. Babangida and his Ministers of the Federal Capital Territory led by Mamman Vatsa, Hamza Abdullahi and later General Gado Nasko, led the regime&#x27;s relocation of the seat of government from Lagos to Abuja on 12 December 1991.

Babangida strengthened the foreign relations of Nigeria. He rejected apartheid in South Africa, involved Nigerian troops in the Liberian Civil War, hosted the Abuja Treaty which gave rise to the African Union and enhanced relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1986, Nigeria joined the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation an international organisation considered the &quot;collective voice of the Muslim world&quot;. This move was welcomed in Northern Nigeria, where there is a Muslim majority population. However, non-Muslims criticised the move likening it to an Islamisation agenda of Nigeria, a secular country. Babangida&#x27;s then second-in-command Commodore Ebitu Okoh Ukiwe, opposed the decision to join the Islamic organization and was removed as Chief of General Staff. Close to the end of his tenure, he paid a state visit to the queen of the United Kingdom making him the second Nigerian leader after Yakubu Gowon to do so.

===Crisis of the Third Republic===

In 1989, Babangida started making plans for the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic. He legalized the formation of political parties and formed the two-party system with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and National Republican Convention (NRC) ahead of the 1992 general elections. He urged all Nigerians to join either of the parties, which the late Chief Bola Ige famously referred to as &quot;two leper hands.&quot; The two-party state had been a Political Bureau recommendation. In November 1991, after a census was conducted, the National Electoral Commission (NEC) announced on 24 January 1992 that both legislative elections to a bicameral National Assembly and a presidential election would be held later that year. A process of voting was adopted, referred to as Option A4. This process advocated that any candidate needed to pass through adoption for all elective positions from the local government, state government, and federal government.

The 1992 parliamentary election went ahead as planned, with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) winning majorities in both houses of the National Assembly, but on 7 August 1992, the NEC annulled the first round of 1992 presidential primaries. Babangida annulled the 7 August presidential primaries which Shehu Yar&#x27;Adua emerged as the SDP presidential candidate and Adamu Ciroma as the NRC candidate order to get rid of the old guard in both parties. In January 1993, Babangida rejigged the ruling military junta – the AFRC – replacing it with the National Defence and Security Council, as the supreme decision-making organ of the regime. He also appointed Ernest Shonekan Head of the Transitional Council and de jure Head of Government. At the time, the transitional council was designed to be the final phase leading to a scheduled handover to an elected democratic leader in the slated 1993 presidential election.

On 12 June 1993, the presidential election was finally held. The results though not officially declared by the National Electoral Commission – showed the duo of Moshood Abiola and Babagana Kingibe of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) defeated Bashir Tofa and Slyvester Ugoh of the National Republican Convention (NRC) by over 2.3 million votes in the 1993 presidential election. The elections were later annulled by military head of state General Babangida, citing electoral irregularities. The annulment led to widespread protests and political unrest in Abiola&#x27;s stronghold of the South West, as many felt Babangida had ulterior motives, and did not want to cede power to Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba businessman. Babangida later admitted that the elections were annulled due to national security considerations, which he didn&#x27;t specify.

The lingering 12 June crisis led to the resignation of General Babangida in August 1993. Babangida signed a decree establishing the Interim National Government led by Ernest Shonekan. As interim president, Shonekan initially appointed Abiola as his vice president, who refused to recognize the interim government, the crisis lingered for months culminating in the seizure of power by General Sani Abacha. Babangida at the height of the crisis stated &quot;If I am sleeping and I hear the Yorubas beating the drums of war, I would go back to sleep.&quot;

==Post presidency==

From his hilltop residence in Minna, Babangida has cultivated a patronage system which cuts across the entire country. In 1998, Babangida was instrumental in the transition to democracy. Babangida is one of the founders of the Peoples Democratic Party alongside other prominent military generals such as Aliyu Mohammed Gusau. They were said to have supported General Olusegun Obasanjo in the 1999 Nigerian presidential election in order to springboard themselves back to power.

In August 2006, Babangida announced that he would run in the 2007 Nigerian presidential election. He said he was doing so &quot;under the banner of the Nigerian people&quot; and accused the country&#x27;s political elite of fuelling Nigeria&#x27;s current ethnic and religious violence. On 8 November 2006, General Babangida picked up a nomination form from the Peoples Democratic Party headquarters in Abuja. This effectively put to rest any speculation about his ambitions to run for the Presidency. His form was personally issued to him by the PDP chairman, Ahmadu Ali. This action immediately drew extreme reactions of support or opposition from the southwest. In December, just before the presidential primaries, it was widely reported in Nigerian newspapers that Babangida had withdrawn his candidacy. In a letter excerpted in the media, IBB is quoted as citing the &quot;moral dilemma&quot; of running against Umaru Yar&#x27;Adua, the younger brother of the late General Shehu Yar&#x27;Adua, as well as against General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, given IBB&#x27;s close relationship with the latter two. It is widely believed that his chances of winning were slim.

In September 2010, Babangida officially declared his intention to run for the presidency in the 2011 presidential election in Abuja, Nigeria. Babangida was later urged by his military inner circle to withdraw his candidacy after the October 2010 Abuja bombing. President Goodluck Jonathan later emerged as the PDP presidential candidate and throughout his presidency sought counsel from Babangida and his military inner circle.

In 2015, following the election of his long-time rival General Muhammadu Buhari as president, Babangida maintained a low profile. In 2017, Babangida had corrective surgery. He is considered a foremost elder statesman, and has called for a generational shift in leadership to allow for a new crop of leaders to replace the 1966 military class.

Speaking during the release of his biography on February 20, 2025, Babangida finally expressed regret for cancelling the 1993 elections, declaring that the elections had been free and fair, and that MKO Abiola indeed won. 

 &quot;Undoubtedly credible, free and fair elections were held on 12 June 1993...However, the tragic irony of history remains that the administration that devised a near-perfect electoral system and conducted those near-perfect elections could not complete the process. ...That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret.&quot;

==Personal life==
A biopic titled &quot;Badamasi: Portrait of a General&quot; which chronicled his early life, life during the Nigerian Civil War as well as his time as the military head of state was produced by Obi Emelonye and released in cinemas on 12 June 2020.

===Family===
Babangida was married to Maryam Babangida from 1969 until her death in 2009. They had four children together; Aisha, Muhammad, Aminu, and Halima. On 27 December 2009, Maryam Babangida died from complications of ovarian cancer.

===Personal wealth===
Babangida is rumoured to be worth over US$5 billion. He is believed to secretly possess a multi-billion dollar fortune via successive ownership of stakes in a number of Nigerian companies.

Magazine Forbes assumed in 2011 that shortly before the Second Gulf War Babangida channelled US$12 billion of unplanned profits (&quot;oil windfall&quot;) into his own pocket (the oil price jumped from US$15/barrel to US$41.15/barrel within weeks in 1990 and then crashed almost as quickly to the old value). Investigations into this did not lead to any concrete results. A critical remark is that the additional profit of US$12 billion calculated by Forbes could only have been realised if Nigeria had sold the entire annual production volume of 630 million barrels exactly on 27 September 1990 at the annual peak price of US$41/barrel - instead of the officially stated US$22/barrel average during the whole year. This is unlikely in view of the long-term supply contracts in the oil business and the sluggishness of the state-owned oil company NNPC. Babangida commented in 2022 on the above allegations that he and his staff had been &quot;saints&quot;. This account should be assessed with as much caution as Forbes&#x27; calculation.

<text>Wanadoo was the Internet service provider division of Orange S.A. It operated in France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Senegal, Mauritius, Madagascar, Lebanon and Jordan. It ceased to operate as a worldwide brand on 1 June 2006, when it was rebranded as Orange.

The origin of the name Wanadoo is subject to some controversy, as some maintain it came about in the late 1990s when many internet companies chose to compete by creating &quot;Yahoo!&quot;-sounding names. However, it might be that the name Wanadoo first appeared in an internal project at France Télécom, much in line with a number of other such projects such as France Animation until 2003, Intranoo, Tatoo, Netatoo and @noo.

Wanadoo was floated on the stock market on 18 July 2000. In 2000, Wanadoo also took over the major British ISP Freeserve, which had previously been part of the Dixons Group. Following the buy-out, Freeserve maintained its own branding for a while before finally changing to the Wanadoo name on 28 April 2004.

In the early 2000 Wanadoo expanded into the games industry by purchasing Index+. Wanadoo integrated Index+ into its new games division, Wanadoo Edition. On 30 September 2003, Wanadoo Edition was integrated into MC2 France and from this deal Wanadoo also became a 12% shareholder of Microïds.

==Orange rebranding==
Wanadoo changed to Orange on 1 June 2006 to simplify branding by France Télécom: this merging of companies has created a single brand offering mobile telecommunications and internet services.

<text>Arthur Bowden Askey (6 June 1900 – 16 November 1982) was an English comedian and actor. Askey was known for his short stature (5&#x27; 2&quot;, 1.58 m) and distinctive horn-rimmed glasses, and his playful humour incorporating improvisation and catchphrases including &quot;Hello playmates!&quot;, &quot;I thank you&quot; (pronounced &quot;Ay-thang-yaw&quot;) and &quot;Before your very eyes&quot;.

Askey achieved prominence in the 1930s in the BBC&#x27;s first radio comedy series &quot;Band Waggon&quot; and subsequently starred in several Gainsborough Pictures comedy films during the Second World War including &quot;Charley&#x27;s (Big-Hearted) Aunt&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; (1941). His novelty recordings for the His Master&#x27;s Voice include &quot;The Bee Song&quot; (1938), a lasting part of his act. From the 1950s, Askey was a prominent television presence and made regular appearances on the BBC&#x27;s long-running music hall programme &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;. Askey was made an OBE in 1969 and a CBE in 1981; he continued to appear frequently on television, radio and the stage until his death in 1982.

== Early life and education ==
Askey was born at 29 Moses Street, Dingle, Liverpool, the eldest child and only son of Betsy (née Bowden), originally from Knutsford, Cheshire, and Samuel Askey, company secretary of Sugar Products of Liverpool. Six months after his birth, the family moved to 90 Rosslyn Street, Liverpool. It was here that a sister, Irene Dorothy, was born. Askey was educated at St. Michael&#x27;s Council School (1905–11) and the Liverpool Institute for Boys (1911–16).

==Career==
Askey served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the First World War and performed in army entertainments. This would prove an excellent training ground for his career in show business, his first professional appearance coming on stage at the Headgate Theatre in Colchester on the 31 March 1924. After working as a clerk for Liverpool Corporation&#x27;s Education Department, he was in a touring concert party, the music halls and was in the stage company of Powis Pinder on the Isle of Wight in the early 1930s before he rose to stardom in 1938 through his role in the first regular radio comedy series, &quot;Band Waggon&quot; on the BBC. &quot;Band Waggon&quot; began as a variety show, but had been unsuccessful until Askey and his partner, Richard Murdoch, took on a larger role in the writing.

===Film roles===

During the Second World War Askey starred in several Gainsborough Pictures comedy films, including &quot;Band Waggon&quot; (1940), based on the radio show; &quot;Charley&#x27;s (Big-Hearted) Aunt&quot; (1940); &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; (1941); &quot;I Thank You&quot; (1941); &quot;Back-Room Boy&quot; (1942); &quot;King Arthur Was a Gentleman&quot; (1942); &quot;Miss London Ltd.&quot; (1943); &quot;Bees in Paradise&quot; (1944); &quot;The Love Match&quot; (1955) and &quot;Make Mine a Million&quot; (1959). 

His last film was &quot;Rosie Dixon – Night Nurse&quot; (1978), starring Debbie Ash.

===Television===
In the early 1930s, Askey appeared on an early form of BBC television—the spinning disc invented by John Logie Baird that scanned vertically and had only thirty lines. Askey had to be heavily made up for his face to be recognisable at such low resolution. When television became electronic, with 405 horizontal lines, Askey was a regular performer in variety shows. When television returned after the second World War, his first TV series was &quot;Before Your Very Eyes!&quot; (1952), named after his catchphrase. On 3 May 1956, Askey presented &quot;Meet The People&quot;, a launch night programme for Granada Television. In 1957 writers Sid Colin and Talbot Rothwell revived the &quot;Band Waggon&quot; format for &quot;Living It Up&quot;, a series that reunited Askey and Murdoch after 18 years. He continued to appear frequently on television in the 1970s, such as being a panellist on the ITV talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;, where his usually sympathetic comments would offset the harsher judgments of fellow judges Tony Hatch and Mickie Most. He also appeared on the comedy panel game &quot;Jokers Wild&quot;. 

He made many TV appearances in variety, including BBC TV&#x27;s long running show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;. His final professional engagement was &quot;The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog&quot;, which was recorded 1982, and broadcast by Channel 4 in 1983.

===Radio===
In the late 1940s, Askey participated in a BBC radio show called &quot;How Do You Do&quot; in which listeners could write into the BBC asking for him to come and broadcast a show from their homes, twelve shows were broadcast with Arthur, his daughter Anthea and special guests, as well as a surprise guest each week which was revealed some time throughout the programme. The theme of each show was worked around the occupation of the family from where it was broadcast. This was broadcast on the Light Programme. Only one of the shows was recorded onto acetate discs, which are now held at The British Library. During the 1950s and 1960s, he appeared in many sitcoms, including &quot;Love and Kisses&quot;, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Treasured Volumes&quot; and &quot;The Arthur Askey Show&quot;. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in December 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, and in December 1974, when Andrews, dressed as Humpty Dumpty, surprised him on a television show while discussing the art of pantomime. Askey made four appearances on the BBC Radio series &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1942, 1955, 1968 and 1980. He shares the record for most appearances on the programme with David Attenborough.

===Theatre===
Askey appeared in the West End musical &quot;Follow the Girls&quot;. He also made many stage appearances as a pantomime dame.

===Recordings===
Askey&#x27;s recording career included &quot;The Bee Song&quot;, which was an integral part of his stage and television act for many years, &quot;The Thing-Ummy Bob&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Like a Banana&quot;, and his theme tune, &quot;Big-Hearted Arthur&quot; (which was also his nickname). In 1941 a song he intended to record, &quot;It&#x27;s Really Nice to See You Mr Hess&quot; (after Hitler&#x27;s deputy Rudolf Hess fled to Scotland), was banned by the War Office. A collection of Askey&#x27;s wartime recordings appear on the CD album &quot;Band Waggon/Big Hearted Arthur Goes To War&quot;.

==&quot;Private Eye&quot;==
&quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine in the 1970s regularly made the comment that he and the Queen Mother had &quot;never been seen in the same room together&quot;, referring to the fact that they were about the same age and height and suggesting that the Queen Mother was Askey in drag.

==Honours==
Askey was appointed OBE in 1969 and advanced to CBE in 1981.

==Personal life, illness and death==
Askey was married to Elizabeth May Swash in 1925 until her death in 1974; he was the father of actress Anthea Askey (1933–1999).

Askey carried on working on his comedy career until just before he was hospitalised in July 1982, owing to poor circulation, which resulted in gangrene and the amputation of both legs. He died in London&#x27;s St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital on 16 November 1982 and was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium.

<doc id="552927" wikidata="Q683846" url="?curid=552927" title="Manila galleon">
<text>The Manila galleon (; ) refers to the Spanish trading ships that linked the Philippines in the Spanish East Indies to Mexico (New Spain), across the Pacific Ocean. The ships made one or two round-trip voyages per year between the ports of Manila and Acapulco from the late 16th to early 19th century. The term &quot;Manila galleon&quot; can also refer to the trade route itself between Manila and Acapulco that was operational from 1565 to 1815. 

The Manila galleon trade route was inaugurated in 1565 after the Augustinian friar and navigator Andrés de Urdaneta pioneered the &quot;tornaviaje&quot; or return route from the Philippines to Mexico. Urdaneta and Alonso de Arellano made the first successful round trips that year, by taking advantage of the Kuroshio Current. The galleons set sail from Cavite, in Manila Bay, at the end of June or the first week of July, sailing through the northern Pacific and reaching Acapulco in March to April of the next calendar year. The return route from Acapulco passes through lower latitudes closer to the equator, stopping over in the Marianas, then sailing onwards through the San Bernardino Strait off Cape Espiritu Santo in Samar and then to Manila Bay and anchoring again off Cavite by June or July. The trade using &quot;Urdaneta&#x27;s route&quot; lasted until 1815, when the Mexican War of Independence broke out. The majority of these galleons were built and loaded in shipyards in Cavite, utilizing native hardwoods like the Philippine teak, with sails produced in Ilocos, and with the rigging and cordage made from salt-resistant Manila hemp. The vast majority of the galleon&#x27;s crew consisted of Filipino natives; many of whom were farmers, street children, or vagrants press-ganged into service as sailors. The officers and other skilled crew were usually Spaniards (a high percentage of whom were of Basque descent). The galleons were state vessels and thus the cost of their construction and upkeep was borne by the Spanish Crown. 

The galleons mostly carried cargoes of Chinese and other Asian luxury goods in exchange for New World silver. Silver prices in Asia were substantially higher than in America, leading to an arbitrage opportunity for the Manila galleon. Every space of the galleons were packed tightly with cargo, even spaces outside the holds like the decks, cabins, and magazines. In extreme cases, they towed barges filled with more goods. While this resulted in slow passage (that sometimes resulted in shipwrecks or turning back), the profit margins were so high that it was commonly practiced. These goods included Indian ivory and precious stones, Chinese silk and porcelain, cloves from the Moluccas islands, cinnamon, ginger, lacquers, tapestries and perfumes from all over Asia. In addition, slaves (collectively known as &quot;&quot;) from various parts of Asia (mainly slaves bought from the Portuguese slave markets and Muslim captives from the Spanish–Moro conflict) were also transported from the Manila slave markets to Mexico. Free indigenous Filipinos also migrated to Mexico via the galleons (including galleon crew that jumped ship), comprising the majority of free Asian settlers (&quot;&quot;) in Mexico, particularly in regions near the terminal ports of the Manila galleons. The route also fostered cultural exchanges that shaped the identities and the culture of the countries involved.

The Manila galleons were also known colloquially in New Spain as La Nao de China (&quot;The China Ship&quot;), because they carried mostly Chinese goods shipped from Manila. The Manila Galleon route was an early instance of globalization, representing a trade route from Asia that crossed to the Americas, thereby connecting all the world&#x27;s continents in global silver trade. 

In 2015, the Philippines and Mexico began preparations for the nomination of the Manila–Acapulco Galleon Trade Route in the UNESCO World Heritage List with backing from Spain, which has also suggested the tri-national nomination of the archives on the Manila–Acapulco Galleons in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

== History ==
=== Discovery of the route ===
In 1521, a Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan sailed west across the Pacific using the westward trade winds. The expedition discovered the Mariana Islands and the Philippines and claimed them for Spain. Although Magellan was killed by natives commanded by Lapulapu during the battle of Mactan in the Philippines, one of his ships, the &quot;Victoria&quot;, made it back to Spain by continuing westward.


To settle and trade with these islands from the Americas, an eastward maritime return path was necessary. The Trinidad, which tried this a few years later, failed. In 1529, Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón also tried sailing east from the Philippines, but could not find &quot;westerlies&quot; across the Pacific. In 1543, Bernardo de la Torre also failed. In 1542, however, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo helped pave the way by sailing north from Mexico to explore the Pacific coast, reaching just north of the 38th parallel at the Russian River. The frustration of these failures is shown in a letter sent in 1552 from Portuguese Goa by the Spanish missionary Francis Xavier to Simão Rodrigues asking that no more fleets attempt the New Spain–East Asia route, lest they be lost.

Despite prior failures navigator Andrés de Urdaneta effectively persuaded Spanish officials in New Spain that a Philippines-Mexico trade route was preferrable to other alternatives. He argued against direct trade between Spain and the Philippines through the strait of Magellan on the basis that climate would made passage through the strait possible only during summer and that therefore ships would need to stay the winter in a more northern port. His preference for Mexico rather than for the shorter oveland route through Darién is thought to have been due to his links to the Pedro de Alvarado.

The Manila–Acapulco galleon trade finally began when Spanish navigators Alonso de Arellano and Andrés de Urdaneta discovered the eastward return route in 1565. Sailing as part of the expedition commanded by Miguel López de Legazpi to conquer the Philippines in 1564, Urdaneta was given the task of finding a return route. Reasoning that the trade winds of the Pacific might move in a gyre as the Atlantic winds did, they sailed north, going all the way to the 38th parallel north, off the east coast of Japan, before catching the westerlies that would take them back across the Pacific. He commanded a vessel which completed the eastward voyage in 129 days; this marked the opening of the Manila galleon trade.

Reaching the west coast of North America, Urdaneta&#x27;s ship, the &quot;San Pedro&quot;, hit the coast near Santa Catalina Island, California, then followed the shoreline south to San Blas and later to Acapulco, arriving on October 8, 1565. Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned. Arellano, who had taken a more southerly route, had already arrived.

The English privateer Francis Drake also reached the California coast, in 1579. After capturing a Spanish ship heading for Manila, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from Manila to Acapulco. He failed in that regard, but staked an English claim somewhere on the northern California coast. Although the ship&#x27;s log and other records were lost, the officially accepted location is now called Drakes Bay, on Point Reyes south of Cape Mendocino.

By the 18th century, it was understood that a less northerly track was sufficient when nearing the North American coast, and galleon navigators steered well clear of the rocky and often fogbound northern and central California coast. According to historian William Lytle Schurz, &quot;They generally made their landfall well down the coast, somewhere between Point Conception and Cape San Lucas ... After all, these were preeminently merchant ships, and the business of exploration lay outside their field, though chance discoveries were welcomed&quot;.

The first motivation for land exploration of present-day California was to scout out possible way stations for the seaworn Manila galleons on the last leg of their journey. Early proposals came to little, but in 1769, the Portola expedition established ports at San Diego and Monterey (which became the administrative center of Alta California), providing safe harbors for returning Manila galleons.

=== The Manila galleon and California ===

Monterey, California, was about two months and three weeks out from Manila in the 18th century, and the galleon tended to stop there 40 days before arriving in Acapulco. Galleons stopped in Monterey prior to California&#x27;s Spanish settlement in 1769; however, visits became regular between 1777 and 1794 because the Crown ordered the galleon to stop in Monterey.

=== Trade ===
Trade with Ming China via Manila served as a major source of revenue for the Spanish Empire and as a fundamental source of income for Spanish colonists in the Philippine Islands. Galleons used for the trade between East and West were crafted by Filipino artisans. Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port. The Manila trade became so lucrative that Seville merchants petitioned king Philip II of Spain to protect the monopoly of the Casa de Contratación based in Seville. This led to the passing of a decree in 1593 that set a limit of two ships sailing each year from either port, with one kept in reserve in Acapulco and one in Manila. An &quot;armada&quot;, or armed escort of galleons, was also approved. Due to official attempts to control the galleon trade, contraband and understating of ships&#x27; cargoes became widespread.
The galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of Fujian, such as Quanzhou, as depicted in the Selden Map, and Yuegang (the old port of Haicheng in Zhangzhou, Fujian), who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, processed silk cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia: jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, the Spanish part of the so-called Nanban trade, including Japanese fans, chests, screens, porcelain and lacquerware.

In addition, slaves of various origins, including East Africa, Portuguese India, the Muslim sultanates of Southeast Asia, and the Spanish Philippines, were transported from Manila and sold in New Spain. African slaves were categorized as &quot;negros&quot; or &quot;cafres&quot; while all slaves of Asian origin were called &quot;chinos&quot;. The lack of detailed records makes it difficult to estimate the total number of slaves transported or the proportions of slaves from each region.

Galleons transported goods to be sold in the Americas, namely in New Spain and Peru, as well as in European markets. East Asia trading primarily functioned on a silver standard due to Ming China&#x27;s use of silver ingots as a medium of exchange. As such, goods were mostly bought with silver mined from New Spain and Potosí. 

The cargoes arrived in Acapulco and were transported by land across Mexico. Mule trains would carry the goods along the China Road from Acapulco first to the administrative center of Mexico City, then on to the port of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico, where they were loaded onto the Spanish treasure fleet bound for Spain. The transport of goods overland by porters, the housing of travelers and sailors at inns by innkeepers, and the stocking of long voyages with food and supplies provided by haciendas before departing Acapulco helped to stimulate the economy of New Spain.

The trade of goods and exchanges of people were not limited to Mexico and the Philippines, since Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru also served as supplementary streams to the main one between Mexico and Philippines. 
Around 80% of the goods shipped back from Acapulco to Manila were from the Americas – silver, cochineal, seeds, sweet potato, corn, tomato, tobacco, chickpeas, chocolate and cocoa, watermelon seeds, vines, and fig trees. The remaining 20% were goods transshipped from Europe and North Africa such as wine and olive oil, and metal goods such as weapons, knobs and spurs.

This Pacific route was the alternative to the trip west across the Indian Ocean, and around the Cape of Good Hope, which was reserved to Portugal according to the Treaty of Tordesillas. It also avoided stopping over at ports controlled by competing powers such as Portugal and the Netherlands. From the early days of exploration, the Spanish knew that the American continent was much narrower across the Panamanian isthmus than across Mexico. They tried to establish a regular land crossing there, but the thick jungle and tropical diseases such as yellow fever and malaria made it impractical.

It took at least four months to sail across the Pacific Ocean from Manila to Acapulco, and the galleons were the main link between the Philippines and the viceregal capital at Mexico City and thence to Spain itself. Many of the so-called &quot;Kastilas&quot; or Spaniards in the Philippines were actually of Mexican descent, and the Hispanic culture of the Philippines is influenced by Spanish and Mexican culture in particular. Soldiers and settlers recruited from Mexico and Peru also gathered in Acapulco before they were sent to settle at the presidios of the Philippines. Even after the galleon era, and at the time when Mexico finally gained its independence, the two nations still continued to trade, except for a brief lull during the Spanish–American War.

In Manila, the safety of ocean crossings was commended to the virgin Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga in masses held by the Archbishop of Manila. If the expedition was successful the voyagers would go to La Ermita (the church) to pay homage, and offer gold and other precious gems or jewelries from Hispanic countries to the image of the virgin. So it came to be that the virgin was named the &quot;Queen of the Galleons&quot;.

Economic shocks due to the arrival of Spanish-American silver in China were among the factors that led to the end of the Ming dynasty.

=== End of the galleons ===
In 1740, as part of the administrative changes of the Bourbon Reforms, the Spanish crown began allowing the use of registered ships or &quot;navíos de registro&quot; in the Pacific. These ships traveled solo, outside the convoy system of the galleons. While these solo voyages would not immediately replace the galleon system, they were more efficient and better able to avoid being captured by the Royal Navy of Great Britain.

In 1813, the Cortes of Cádiz decreed the suppression of the route and the following year, with the end of the Peninsular War, Ferdinand VII of Spain ratified the dissolution. The last ship to reach Manila was the &quot;San Fernando&quot; or &quot;Magallanes&quot;, which arrived empty, as its cargo had been requisitioned in Mexico.

The Manila–Acapulco galleon trade ended in 1815, a few years before Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821. After this, the Spanish Crown took direct control of the Philippines, and governed directly from Madrid. Sea transport became easier in the mid-19th century after the invention of steam powered ships and the opening of the Suez Canal, which reduced the travel time from Spain to the Philippines to 40 days.

== Galleons ==

=== Construction ===

Between 1609 and 1616, nine galleons and six galleys were constructed in Philippine shipyards. The average cost was 78,000 pesos per galleon and at least 2,000 trees. The galleons constructed included the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;, &quot;San Marcos&quot;, &quot;Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe&quot;, &quot;Angel de la Guardia&quot;, &quot;San Felipe&quot;, &quot;Santiago&quot;, &quot;Salbador&quot;, &quot;Espiritu Santo&quot;, and &quot;San Miguel&quot;. &quot;From 1729 to 1739, the main purpose of the Cavite shipyard was the construction and outfitting of the galleons for the Manila to Acapulco trade run.&quot;

Due to the route&#x27;s high profitability but long voyage time, it was essential to build the largest possible galleons, which were the largest class of European ships known to have been built until then. In the 16th century, they averaged from 1,700 to 2,000 tons, were built of Philippine hardwoods and could carry 300–500 passengers. The &quot;Concepción&quot;, wrecked in 1638, was long and displaced some 2,000 tons. The &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was long. Most of the ships were built in the Philippines; only eight were built in Mexico.

=== Crews ===
Sailors averaged age 28 or 29 while the oldest were between 40 and 50. Ships&#x27; pages were children who entered service mostly at age 8, many orphans or poor taken from the streets of Seville, Mexico and Manila. Apprentices were older than the pages and if successful would be certified as sailor at age 20. Mortality rates were high with ships arriving in Manila with a majority of their crew often dead from starvation, disease and scurvy, especially in the early years, so Spanish officials in Manila found it difficult to find men to crew their ships to return to Acapulco. Many &quot;indios&quot; of Filipino and Southeast Asian origin made up the majority of the crew. Other crew were made up of deportees and criminals from Spain and the colonies. Many criminals were sentenced to serve as crew on royal ships. Less than a third of the crew was Spanish and they usually held key positions aboard the galleon.

At port, goods were unloaded by dockworkers, and food was often supplied locally. In Acapulco, the arrival of the galleons provided seasonal work, as for dockworkers who were typically free black men highly paid for their back breaking labor, and for farmers and haciendas across Mexico who helped stock the ships with food before voyages. On land, travelers were often housed at inns or &quot;mesones&quot;, and had goods transported by muleteers, which provided opportunities for indigenous people in Mexico. By providing for the galleons, Spanish colonial America was tied into the broader global economy.

=== Shipwrecks ===
The wrecks of the Manila galleons are legends second only to the wrecks of treasure ships in the Caribbean. In 1568, Miguel López de Legazpi&#x27;s own ship, the &quot;San Pablo&quot; (300 tons), was the first Manila galleon to be wrecked en route to Mexico. Between the years 1576 when the &quot;Espiritu Santo&quot; was lost and 1798 when the &quot;San Cristobal (2)&quot; was lost, twenty Manila galleons wrecked within the Philippine archipelago. In 1596 the &quot;San Felipe&quot; was wrecked in Japan. 

At least one galleon, probably the &quot;Santo Cristo de Burgos&quot;, is believed to have wrecked on the coast of Oregon in 1693. Known as the Beeswax wreck, the event is described in the oral histories of the Tillamook and Clatsop, which suggest that some of the crew survived.

===Captures===
Between 1565 and 1815, 108 ships operated as Manila galleons, of which 26 were captured or sunk by the enemy during wartime, including the &quot;Santa Ana&quot; captured in 1587 by Thomas Cavendish off the coast of Baja California; the &quot;San Diego&quot;, which was sunk in 1600 in Bahía de Manila by Oliver Van Noort; &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación&quot; captured by Woodes Rogers in 1709; &quot;Nuestra Senora de la Covadonga&quot; captured in 1743 by George Anson; &quot;Nuestra Senora de la Santisima Trinidad&quot; captured in 1762 by HMS &quot;Panther&quot; and HMS &quot;Argo&quot; at the Action of 30 October 1762 in the San Bernardino Strait; &quot;San Sebastián&quot; and &quot;Santa Ana&quot; captured in 1753–54 by George Compton; and &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Santísima Trinidad&quot;, in 1762, by Samuel Cornish.

==Possible contact with Hawaii==
Over 250 years, there were hundreds of Manila galleon crossings of the Pacific Ocean between present-day Mexico and the Philippines, with their route taking them just south of the Hawaiian Islands on the westward leg of their round trip and yet there are no records of contact with the Hawaiians. British historian Henry Kamen maintains that the Spanish did not have the ability to properly explore the Pacific Ocean and were not capable of finding the islands which lay at a latitude 20° north of the westbound galleon route and its currents. However, Spanish exploration in the Pacific was paramount until the late 18th century. Spanish navigators discovered many islands including Guam, the Marianas, the Carolines and the Philippines in the North Pacific, as well as Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Easter Island in the South Pacific. Spanish navigators also discovered the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos during their search for Terra Australis in the 17th century.
This navigational activity poses the question as to whether Spanish explorers did arrive in the Hawaiian Islands two centuries before Captain James Cook&#x27;s first visit in 1778. Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 with a Spanish sailor named Ivan Gaetan or Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano&#x27;s reports seem to describe the discovery of either Hawaii or the Marshall Islands in 1555.

The westward route from Mexico passed south of Hawaii, making a short stopover in Guam before heading for Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers, and to avoid Dutch and English pirates. Due to this policy of discretion, if the Spanish did find Hawaii during their voyages, they would not have published their findings and the discovery would have remained unknown. From Gaetano&#x27;s account, the Hawaiian islands were not known to have any valuable resources, so the Spanish would not have made an effort to settle them. This happened in the case of the Marianas and the Carolines, which were not effectively settled until the second half of the 17th century. Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands (reliable methods of determining longitude were not developed until the mid-eighteenth century). In this manuscript, the Island of Maui is named &quot;La Desgraciada&quot; (the unhappy, or unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of Hawaii is named &quot;La Mesa&quot; (the table). Islands resembling Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai are named &quot;Los Monjes&quot; (the monks).

The theory that the first European visitors to Hawaii were Spanish is reinforced by the findings of William Ellis, a writer and missionary who lived in early 19th century Hawaii; he recorded several folk stories about foreigners who had visited Hawaii prior to first contact with Cook. According to Hawaiian writer Herb Kawainui Kane, one of these stories:
concerned seven foreigners who landed eight generations earlier at Kealakekua Bay in a painted boat with an awning or canopy over the stern. They were dressed in clothing of white and yellow, and one wore a sword at his side and a feather in his hat. On landing, they kneeled down in prayer. The Hawaiians, most helpful to those who were most helpless, received them kindly. The strangers ultimately married into the families of chiefs, but their names could not be included in genealogies&quot;.

Some scholars, particularly American, have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility. Debate continues as to whether the Hawaiian Islands were actually visited by the Spanish in the 16th century with researchers like Richard W. Rogers looking for evidence of Spanish shipwrecks.

==Preparations for UNESCO nominations==
In 2010, the Philippines foreign affairs secretary organized a diplomatic reception attended by at least 32 countries, for discussions about the historic galleon trade and the possible establishment of a galleon museum. Various Mexican and Filipino institutions and politicians also made discussions about the importance of the galleon trade in their shared history.

In 2013, the Philippines released a documentary regarding the Manila galleon trade route.

In 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila–Acapulco Galleon Trade Route as a World Heritage Site was initiated by the Mexican and Filipino ambassadors to UNESCO. Spain has also backed the nomination and suggested that the archives related to the route under the possession of the Philippines, Mexico, and Spain be nominated as part of another UNESCO list, the Memory of the World Register.

In 2015, the Unesco National Commission of the Philippines (Unacom) and the Department of Foreign Affairs organized an expert&#x27;s meeting to discuss the trade route&#x27;s nomination. Some of the topics presented include the Spanish colonial shipyards in Sorsogon, underwater archaeology in the Philippines, the route&#x27;s influences on Filipino textile, the galleon&#x27;s eastward trip from the Philippines to Mexico called &quot;tornaviaje&quot;, and the historical dimension of the galleon trade focusing on important and rare archival documents.

In 2017, the Philippines established the Manila–Acapulco Galleon Museum in Metro Manila, one of the necessary steps in nominating the trade route to UNESCO.

In 2018, Mexico reopened its Manila galleon gallery at the Archaeological Museum of Puerto Vallarta, Cuale.

In 2020, Mexico released a documentary regarding the Manila galleon trade route.

<doc id="552931" wikidata="Q1067475" url="?curid=552931" title="List of countries that border only one other country">
<text>This is a list of countries that have a land border with only one other country. Some on this list have a maritime border with additional countries. Some countries, which are not listed here, have no land border but do have a maritime border with a single other country, such as Sri Lanka.

There are generally three arrangements by which a country would have a single land border:

* an island divided between two states, such as between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, or between Ireland and the United Kingdom.
* a peninsula or a semi-enclave, where one country has a land border with a neighbouring one but is otherwise surrounded by sea, while the neighbour borders other countries—examples are Portugal (neighbouring Spain), The Gambia (surrounded by Senegal) and Brunei (surrounded by Malaysia). This applies to peninsulas, but also to non-peninsular nations like The Gambia and Brunei.
* the three countries forming a landlocked true enclave, surrounded by a larger country: San Marino and Vatican City (within Italy) and Lesotho (within South Africa).

Territory leased or ceded by one country to another for perpetual use, but not in sovereignty, such as Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, or memorials, such as the American Cemetery in France, do not constitute true territorial borders because the land occupied remains a formal part of the host country.

This list is based on the Correlates of War Direct Contiguity data set, with maritime causeways and bridges not being counted.

== Countries bordering only one other country ==

This section considers only sovereign countries, not constituent countries like Wales and Scotland, which border only England.

===Landlocked===
===With coast===
== Causeways, bridges, and tunnels ==

Often called fixed crossings or fixed links, transportation corridors constructed to cross bodies of water without any intermittent connections such as ferries or ships may be between different states. These may be considered artificial &quot;persistent&quot; borderpoints for land vehicles or pedestrians, but are not typically considered land borders given their need for continuous operation and maintenance, as well as their ease of volume control or closure by either state. Two countries are islands and have no land borders, but maintain fixed borderpoints with other nations.

== Dependent territories ==
In some cases, a dependent territory of one nation borders another nation.

== Integral parts of sovereign states ==
In most cases, an integral part of a larger country shares a border with another nation.

== Historical ==
Many countries historically had only one neighbour. Some no longer exist while others now have either no land borders or borders with more than one nation due to border changes.

* Canada: bordered only by the United States until 2022, it now shares a short border with the Kingdom of Denmark at Hans Island, with Canada&#x27;s Nunavut on one side and Denmark&#x27;s Greenland on the other side.
* Kingdom of Denmark: bordered only by Germany (with a causeway connecting it to Sweden) until 2022 (the constituent country of Denmark still only borders Germany), it now shares a short border with Canada at Hans Island, with Canada&#x27;s Nunavut on one side and Denmark&#x27;s Greenland on the other side.
* Korea: bordered only China for several hundred years before 1860, after which a second international border with Russia appeared (approx. long), according to the Convention of Peking. Following the division of Korea in 1945 only North Korea now shares this border.
* Ciskei: one of the Bantustans of South Africa; created under apartheid, reincorporated on April 27, 1994.
* Venda: another Bantustan, Venda was a true enclave bordering only South Africa and separated narrowly from Zimbabwe by the Madimbo corridor to the north; reincorporated on April 27, 1994.

<text>The Claroteidae are a family of catfish (order Siluriformes) found in Africa. This family was separated from Bagridae. However, the monophyly of the family is sometimes contested.

The 12 genera contain 86 known species of claroteids in two subfamilies, Claroteinae and Auchenoglanidinae. The subfamily Auchenoglanidinae is sometimes classified as a separate family Auchenoglanididae. This group was also often formerly placed in Bagridae. The monophyly of Auchenoglanidinae is uncontested; it contains the three genera &quot;Auchenoglanis&quot;, &quot;Parauchenoglanis&quot; and &quot;Notoglanidium&quot;.

Two commonly known species are the giraffe catfish, &quot;Auchenoglanis occidentalis&quot;, and the African big-eye catfish, &quot;Chrysichthys longipinnis&quot;.

Claroteids have moderately elongated bodies, usually with four pairs of barbels, an adipose fin, and strong pectoral and dorsal fin spines.

The earliest known fossil member of the Claroteidae is &quot;Nigerium&quot; from the Late Paleocene and Early Eocene of Nigeria and Mali. The extinct genus &quot;Eaglesomia&quot; is also known from the Middle Eocene of Nigeria. The Late Eocene genus &quot;Fajumia&quot; from Egypt is of uncertain affinities, but most likely belongs to this group. In addition, extinct species of the extant genus &quot;Chrysichthys&quot; are known from the Middle Eocene of Tanzania, suggesting significant diversification by that point. In contrast to the freshwater nature of modern claroteids, most of these fossil genera are known from marine deposits. Although White (1934) postulated that this may be due to freshwater catfish remains being reworked into marine deposits, Murray &amp; Homes (2021) suggested that these genera may represent extinct marine lineages of the family. This is further supported by the fact that much of catfish biogeography can only be explained through the marine dispersal of groups that are currently found only in freshwater.

<doc id="552965" wikidata="Q905180" url="?curid=552965" title="F-center">
<text>An F-center or color center or Farbe center (from the original German &quot;Farbzentrum&quot;, where &quot;Farbe&quot; means &quot;color&quot; and &quot;zentrum&quot; means &quot;center&quot;) is a type of crystallographic defect in which an anionic vacancy in a crystal lattice is occupied by one or more unpaired electrons. Electrons in such a vacancy in a crystal lattice tend to absorb light in the visible spectrum such that a material that is usually transparent becomes colored. The greater the number of F centers, the more intense the color of the compound. F centers are a type of color center.

This is used to identify many compounds, especially zinc oxide (yellow).

==History==
Before the discovery of point defects it was already known that some crystals can be discolored using various methods. In 1830 T.J. Pearsall discovered that fluorspar could be discolored using violet light. Thirty years later similar results were achieved by melting crystals together with a specific metal. In 1921 W. Röntgen extensively measured rock salts. One set of these tests measured a photoelectric conductivity 40,000 times larger, after the salt was radiated with x-rays. A similar result to x-rays was accomplished by coloring the crystals with metal vapors. The photoelectric effect mainly happened around specific wavelengths, which was later found to be non-colloidal in nature.

The discolorations were later named F centers, as in &quot;Farbe&quot;, the German word for color. In 1933 Mollwo concluded that these F centers are atomic crystal defects. Around this time people started to assert these defects were unpaired electrons. The vacancy model was first described in 1937 but still was considered tentative. It took until 1957 to prove that this was true using electron spin resonance.

== Occurrences ==
F centers can occur naturally in compounds (particularly metallic oxides) because when heated to high temperature the ions become excited and are displaced from their normal crystallographic positions, leaving behind some electrons in the vacated spaces. This effect is also exhibited by ionic compounds containing metal-excess defects.

Often F centers are paramagnetic and can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance techniques. The F centers most commonly studied are those that occur in alkali metal halides. Alkali metal halides are normally transparent; they do not show absorption from the far ultraviolet into the far infrared. Thus any changes in optical absorption can easily be detected and studied.
The absorption band of F centers in sodium chloride is located around blue light, giving a sodium chloride crystal with sufficient F center defects a yellow tinge. In other alkali chlorides the location of the F center absorption band ranges from violet to yellow light. The formation of F centers is the reason that some crystals like lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and zinc oxide become pink, lilac and yellow, respectively, when heated.

Though F centers have been observed in other materials, they are generally not the cause for coloration in those materials. There are few examples of naturally occurring F centers causing colorations. One possible candidate is the mineral Blue John. This is a form of fluorite, CaF2. Although it has not been confirmed, it is believed that the colour is caused by electron F centers. It is thought that this F center is formed due to nearby uranium deposits in the rock; the radioactive decay radiation caused the energy necessary to form the F center. 

Another example of an F center found in nature is a relatively long-lived F center found in sapphire through luminescence, which had a duration of about 36 ms in one study.

==Types of F centers==
There are different types of electron centers, depending on the material and radiation energy. An F center is usually a position in a lattice where an anion, a negatively charged ion, is replaced by an electron. An H center (a halogen interstitial) is in a sense the opposite to an F center, so that when the two come into contact in a crystal they combine and cancel out both defects. This process can be photoinduced, e.g., using a laser.
===Single vacancy F center===
Sometimes the F center might acquire an additional electron, making the F center negatively charged, such that it is called an F− center. Similarly, when the F center misses an electron, when it is ionised, it will be an F+ center.
It is also possible to have a -2e charged anion, needing 2 electrons to form an F center. Adding or taking away an electron will make it an F− or F+ center respectively according to the convention.

Another type of a single vacancy F center is the FA center which consists of an F center with one neighbouring positive ion replaced by a positive ion of a different kind. These FA centers are divided into two groups, FA(I) and FA(II) depending on the type of replacement ion. FA(I) centers have similar properties as regular F centers, whereas FA(II) centers cause two potential wells to form in the excited state due to the repositioning of a halide ion. Similar to the FA is the FB center, which consists of an F center with two neighbouring positive ions replaced by a positive ion of a different kind. The FB centers are also divided into two groups, FB(I) and FB(II), with similar behaviour to the FA(I) and FA(II) centers. Due to the statistical nature of the distribution of impurity ions, FB centers are much more rare than FA centers.
===Complex F center===

Combinations of neighbouring F centers due to neighbouring anion vacancies will be called, for two and three neighbours respectively, F2 and F3 centers. Larger aggregates of F centers is certainly possible, but the details of its behaviour are yet unknown.
An F2 center can also be ionised, and form an F2+ center. When this type is found next to a cation impurity, this is an (F2+)A center.
===Fs centers===
F centers can appear anywhere in the crystal but have substantially different properties if formed on the surface of an oxide crystal. Electrons bound in Fs centers have smaller transition energies compared to bulk F centers. Surface F centers in alkali halide crystals behave as a slightly perturbed bulk center, with a shift of below -0.1eV.

They tend to protrude from the surface compared to regular lattice points as well.
With F centers being less bound than electrons at regular lattice sites, they work as a catalyst for adsorption.
However this means that these defects quickly deteriorate in open air by absorbing oxygen, but are reversible by removing the oxygen from the environment. The ESR spectrum of Fs center is temperature dependent in the hyperfine structure in oxides. This must arise from an increasing overlap of the unpaired electron wave function at the Nucleus of the positive ion.
Fs center can be changed or destroyed by heating. The defects in alkali halide crystals are destroyed at low temperatures. crystals start to slowly discolour at 200 K. For oxides temperatures to destroy these defects is substantially higher, 570 K for CaO. In oxides it is possible to create complex Fs centers by annealing.

==Creating F centers in a laboratory==
===Irradiation===

The first F centers created were in alkali halide crystals. These halides were exposed to high-energy radiation, such as X-rays, gamma radiation or a tesla coil.

There are three mechanisms of energy absorption by radiation:

a) Exciton formation. This amounts to an excitation of a valence electron in a halide ion. The energy gained (typically 7 or 8 eV) will partly be lost again through the emission of a luminescent photon. The rest of the energy is available for displacing ions. This energy radiates through the lattice as heat. However, it turns out that his energy is too low to move ions and therefore not capable of generating F centers.

b) Single ionization. This corresponds to separating an electron from a halide ion; the energy required is about 2 eV more than exciton formation.  One can imagine that the halide ion which lost an electron, is not properly bound on its lattice site any more. It is possible that it will move through the lattice. The created vacancy can now trap the electron, creating the F center. If the halide ion recaptures the electron first, it can release more thermal energy than by exciton formation (2 eV more) and it could cause other ions to move also.

c)  Multiple ionization. This process requires the most energy. A photon interacts with a halide ion, ionizing it twice, leaving it positively charged. The ion remaining is very unstable and will quickly move to another position, leaving a vacancy which can trap an electron to become an F center. To free two electrons, about 18 eV is required (in the case of KCl or NaCl). Research suggests about one double ionization occurs in ten single ionizations. However, the created positive halide ion will easily and quickly adopt an electron; making it unable to create the F center.

The most likely mechanism of F center creation is not yet determined. Both are possible and likely, but which once occurs the most is unknown.

The formation of an F2 center is very similar. An F center is ionized and becomes a vacancy; the electron moves through the material to bind to another F center, which becomes an F− center. The electron vacancy moves through the material and ends up next to the F− center, which gives its electron back to the vacancy, forming two neighbouring F centers, i.e. an F2 center.

===Additive coloring===
A different way of creating color centers is by additive coloring. A crystal with F centers is chemically equivalent as a perfect crystal plus stoichiometric excess of the alkali metal.

This is done by heating the crystal to a high temperature in the vapour of the corresponding metal. The temperature is bounded by its melting point and the temperature at which colloids form, e.g. for KCl between ~400 and 768°C. Metal atoms are captured on the surface of the crystal, where they are ionized, and the valence electron is shunted to the crystal lattice. Since this process happens at high temperatures, the mobility of ions is also high. A negative ion will move towards the newly formed ion. This leaves behind an anionic vacancy which can trap the electron to form an F center. Afterwards the crystal is quenched to prevent the F centers moving through the crystal to form colloids. 
An example of this process is heating NaCl in a metallic sodium atmosphere.

Na0 → Na+ + e−
Na+ is incorporated into the NaCl crystal after giving up an electron.
A Cl− vacancy is generated to balance the excess Na+. The effective positive charge of the Cl− vacancy traps the electron released by the Na atom.

In oxides it is possible to additively color a crystal with a different metal than the cation. The resulting absorption spectra are substantially the same as if the component metal was used. 

===Low temperature vapour deposition===
It is possible to create stable Fs centers on alkali halide crystals using vapour depositions at low temperatures, below -200 °C.

==Color center lasers==

Certain F centers have optical absorption and emission bands that makes them useful as laser gain media. Lasers based on color centers are operated analogously to dye lasers. They provide a wavelength range from 0.8 to 4.0 μm, the near infrared region of light, thus picking up where dye lasers fail to operate. Lasers that operate in the near infrared region of the spectrum are used as a light source in infrared spectroscopy, used to study for instance molecular vibrations.

Only certain F centers are suitable for application in color center lasers, known as laser-active F centers. Simple F centers are not laser-active, but more complex F centers have been shown to form stable color center lasers. These are namely FA(II), FB(II), F2+ and (F2+)A centers. Other even more complex F centers are potentially laser-active, but they do not play a significant role in color center lasers physics.
Examples of a material with FA centers used in color center lasers are crystals of potassium chloride (KCl) or rubidium chloride (RbCl) doped with lithium chloride (LiCl), containing FLi-centers. These crystals have been found to be good materials for color center lasers with emission lines of wavelengths between 2.45 and 3.45 μm.

F centers usually have an absorption band in visible range, and the emission is Stokes shifted to longer wavelengths. The differences in peaks is often larger than a factor of 2 and the resulting emissions are near infrared. However at lower temperatures the shift becomes smaller, though there are some crystals that are able to emit visible light. One such example is powdered MgO, treated with additive coloring, emitting violet-blue light by absorbing violet light in vacuum.

<text>The Mochokidae are a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes) that are known as the squeakers or known as upside-down catfish (although not all species swim upside-down). There are nine genera and about 200 species of mochokids. All the mochokids are freshwater species originating from Africa.

They have three pairs of barbels, with the nasal barbels absent; sometimes, the mandibular barbels may be branched. The lips are modified into a suckermouth in &quot;Atopochilus&quot;, &quot;Chiloglanis&quot;, and &quot;Euchilichthys&quot;. The adipose fin is usually very long. The dorsal and pectoral fins have spines that are usually strong and with a locking mechanism. They range in size up to SL. This group contains many popular species among aquarists, such as &quot;Synodontis nigriventris&quot;, &quot;Synodontis angelicus&quot;, and &quot;Synodontis multipunctatus&quot;.

<text>Willard Leroy Phelps (born October 23, 1941) is a former Yukon politician, who briefly served as the second premier of Yukon in 1985.

==Background==
Born in 1941, he was the grandson of Willard &quot;Deacon&quot; Phelps and the son of John Phelps, both former members of the Yukon Territorial Council. He graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1968 with a law degree.

==Political career==
Phelps was first elected to the Yukon Territorial Council in 1974, but his election was overturned in 1975 after Don Branigan filed for a court injunction on the grounds that as the government was renting space in Phelps&#x27; commercial real estate holdings for some of its liquor stores, his serving on the council placed him in a conflict of interest.

He did not run for the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the elections of 1978 or 1982. However, with the resignation of Chris Pearson as government leader in 1985 the Progressive Conservatives chose Phelps as its new leader and he was accordingly the second &quot;Government Leader&quot; from March 23 to May 28, 1985, when the Yukon NDP took office after winning the 1985 election. Phelps was leader of the opposition from 1985 until 1991. When the Progressive Conservatives became the Yukon Party, Phelps became an Independent Alliance MLA but sat in the new party&#x27;s caucus.

When John Ostashek&#x27;s Yukon Party took power in 1992 with a minority government, Phelps lent his support and became minister of justice, health and social services. In 1994 he dropped the justice portfolio and picked up responsibility for education. In his responsibilities for social services, Phelps instituted welfare reform hiring private investigators to look into welfare recipients. He also argued for the privatization of the government owned energy concern. Phelps resigned his cabinet positions in March 1996. Phelps ran for re-election but lost his seat in the fall election.

Phelps formed the United Citizens Party of Yukon in 2009 to oppose the government of Dennis Fentie. He resigned as the party leader on May 9, 2011 for health reasons and due to waning interest.

<text>An enabling act is a piece of legislation by which a legislative body grants an entity which depends on it (for authorization or legitimacy) for the delegation of the legislative body&#x27;s power to take certain actions. For example, enabling acts often establish government agencies to carry out specific government policies in a modern nation. The effects of enabling acts from different times and places vary widely.

== Germany ==
The German word for an enabling act is (). It usually refers to the enabling act of 23 March 1933 which became a cornerstone of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power.

=== Acts of 1914–1927 ===
The first enabling act is dated from 4 August 1914 just after the German entry into World War I. With the vote of the Social Democratic Party, the Reichstag (the German Empire&#x27;s parliament) agreed to give the government certain powers to take the necessary economic measures during the war. Such enabling acts were also common in other countries. The Reichstag had to be informed, and had the right to abolish a decree based on the enabling act. This ensured that the government used its rights with care and only in rare cases was a decree abolished. The parliament retained its right to make law.

In the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), there were several enabling acts: three in 1919, one in 1920, one in 1921, three in 1923, one in 1926, and one in 1927. The enabling act on 24 February 1923, originally limited until 1 June but extended until 31 October, empowered the cabinet to resist the occupation of the Ruhr. There was an enabling act on 13 October 1923 and an enabling act on 8 December 1923 that would last until the dissolution of the Reichstag on 13 March 1924.

Most of them had a temporal limit but only vague thematic limits. On the basis of these acts, a vast number of decrees were signed with enormous importance for social and economic life, the judicial system, and taxes. For example, the reform of German currency in response to hyperinflation, the merger of the into the national railway system, and unemployment pay were settled via such decrees (). The Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924 abolished the jury as trier of fact and replaced it with a mixed system of judges and lay judges in Germany&#x27;s judiciary which still exists today.

These enabling acts were unconstitutional, as the Weimar constitution did not provide the possibility that one organ (parliament) would transfer its rights to another one (executive government). But constitutional experts accepted them because they came into existence with a two-thirds majority, the same majority as for constitutional changes. The government had succeeded in gathering those majorities by threatening to call for presidential emergency dictatorial decrees (), otherwise. In March 1924, the Reichstag wanted to discuss the abolition of decrees (which was granted by the enabling act of February that year). President Friedrich Ebert dismissed parliament to avoid discussion and abolishments.

In later years, governments failed to gather two-thirds of majorities since the radicalization of the revolutionary national-conservative German National People&#x27;s Party in 1928 and the rise of the National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi Party) after 1930. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning (1930–1932) worked with presidential decrees which replaced most of the ordinary legislature, eventually.

The enabling acts had set a poor and dangerous example, but for the government, they had the advantage that they appeared less unconstitutional and dictatorial compared to presidential decrees. Parliament could prefer those acts because they were valid only for a limited time and included mostly a kind of cooperation (e.g. via a special house committee).

=== Enabling Act of 1933 ===

The German word usually refers to the Enabling Act of 1933, officially (&quot;Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the State&quot;). It became a cornerstone of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power. Unlike, for example, Wilhelm Marx&#x27;s enabling act of December 1923, Hitler&#x27;s Act:

* was limited to four years, not several months;
* enabled government not only to create decrees, but even laws and treaties with other countries;
* allowed laws to deviate from the Weimar Constitution;
* did not impose thematic limits;
* did not provide a right to control or abolish these laws, not for any house committee nor the Reichsrat (the common organ of the states of Germany).

In comparison to the situation of the 1920s, Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party and his coalition partner the DNVP did have a parliamentary majority since the general elections of 3 March 1933. Those elections and then the voting in the Reichstag were carried out in a climate of intimidation and violence carried out by right-wing paramilitary groups such as the Nazi . On 23 March, the Communist Party of Germany was already banned and its delegates imprisoned, the Social Democrat delegates were the only ones present in the Reichstag to vote against, while the Centre Party and centre-right parties voted yes.

The Enabling Act of 1933 was renewed by a purely Nazi Reichstag in 1937 and 1939. In 1941 and 1943, it was renewed by decree, though without a time limit in 1943. Although it states that it is valid only for the duration of the current Hitler government of 1933, it remained in force even after major changes of ministers. In any case, Hitler called the cabinet together only very rarely after the first months of 1933. The last cabinet meeting happened in 1937. He preferred to govern via decrees and personal orders.

=== Federal Republic ===
Following the enactment in 1949 of the Basic Law (), there have been no enabling acts in the Federal Republic of Germany. The constitution states that it can be changed only by an explicit alteration of the phrasing.

== United Kingdom ==
=== Act of 1919 ===

The Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5. c. 76) gave a considerable degree of self-government to the Church of England while retaining overall parliamentary supervision. Before its passing, almost all adjustments to the legal structure of the Church of England had involved getting a specific bill through Parliament. It took nine sessions to approve the salary of the Archdeacon of Cornwall, and of the 217 bills introduced into the House of Commons between 1880 and 1913, only 33 passed into law for lack of parliamentary time, among the casualties being the bills to establish new dioceses.

The act gave the newly established Church Assembly, predecessor of the General Synod, power to prepare and present to Parliament measures which could either be approved or rejected, but not modified by either House. Before being voted on, the proposals were examined by an Ecclesiastical Committee of both Houses which reported on their effects and implications. Once approved in Parliament, the measure became law on receiving royal assent.

The act continues to apply today to the General Synod of the Church of England which, as a result of the Synodical Government Measure 1969, replaced the Church Assembly with the aim of achieving full integration of the laity and eliminating the complications caused by the dual control of the Convocations of Canterbury and York, and the Assembly. All the Assembly&#x27;s powers passed to the new synod along with many of those of the Convocations.

=== Proposals ===
In the 1930s, both Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee advocated an enabling act to allow a future Labour government to pass socialist legislation which could not be amended by normal parliamentary procedures and the House of Lords. According to Cripps, his &quot;Planning and Enabling Act&quot; would not be able to be repealed, and the orders made by the government using the act would not be allowed discussion in Parliament. Cripps also suggested measures against the monarchy, but quickly dropped the idea.

During the Great Depression and World War II, Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists pledged to enact an enabling act establishing a corporatist dictatorship if it were allowed to form a government. It would have totally nationalized the economy into a national corporation with 25 affiliates represented in the government through a reformed House of Lords, abolished the House of Commons&#x27; legislative authority, and allowed a royally-appointed Prime Minister and Cabinet to rule by decree through Orders in Council. In 1966 Oswald Mosley advocated a government of national unity drawn from &quot;the professions, from science, from the unions and the managers, from businessmen, the housewives, from the services, from the universities, and even from the best of the politicians&quot;. This coalition would be a &quot;hard centre&quot; oriented one which would also get Parliament to pass an Enabling Act in order to stop what Mosley described as &quot;time-wasting obstructionism of present procedure&quot;. He also claimed that Parliament would always retain the power to dismiss his government by a motion of censure if its policies failed or if it attempted to &quot;override basic British freedoms&quot;.

=== Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 ===

In early 2006 the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill was introduced to Parliament. This Bill, if enacted as introduced, would have enabled Government ministers to amend or repeal any legislation (including the L&amp;RR Bill itself), subject to vague and highly subjective restraints, by decree and without recourse to Parliament. The Bill was variously described as the &quot;Abolition of Parliament Bill&quot; and &quot;of first-class constitutional significance ... [and would] markedly alter the respective and long standing roles of minister and Parliament in the legislative process&quot;. The Bill was, in essence, an Enabling Act in all but name. After some amendment by the government and Lords, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill received Royal Assent on 8 November 2006. Amendments included removing its ability to modify itself or the Human Rights Act 1998; most of the other modifications were much more subjectively defined.

== United States ==
In the United States at the national level, an &quot;enabling act&quot; is a statute by the United States Congress authorizing the people of a territory to frame a proposed state constitution as a step towards admission to the Union. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers.

Enabling acts can contain restrictions, such as the prohibition of polygamy in the Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma acts. Nevada was required to abolish slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime; to guarantee freedom of religious practice to all inhabitants; and to agree that all public lands owned by the federal government at the time of statehood would be retained after admission. The applicant territory then submits its proposed constitution to Congress, which either accepts it or requires changes. For example, in 1866, Congress refused the proposed Nebraska constitution because it limited suffrage to white males. Enabling Acts approved by Congress include:
* Enabling Act of 1802, for the formation of Ohio from the Northwest Territory
* Enabling Act of 1811, for the formation of Louisiana from the Territory of Orleans
* Enabling Act of 1864, for the formation of Nevada
* Enabling Act of 1889, for the formation of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington
* , for the formation of Utah
* Enabling Act of 1906 for the formation of Oklahoma from Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory
* Enabling Act of 1910, for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico

Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted, and the act of Congress admitting Kentucky to the Union was passed before the constitution of Kentucky was drafted.

=== State Enabling Acts ===
At the state government level, state enabling acts allow local jurisdictions to make laws regarding certain issues on the state&#x27;s behalf. For example, many states passed their own version of the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act, which enabled municipalities to regulate land use with local zoning laws. Other enabling acts have allowed municipalities to establish foreign-trade zones, collect impact fees, or create public utilities.

== Venezuela ==
In Venezuela, enabling laws allowing the president to rule by decree in selected matters were granted to Rómulo Betancourt (1959), Carlos Andrés Pérez (1974), Jaime Lusinchi (1984), Ramón José Velásquez (1993) and Rafael Caldera (1994). Pérez issued over 3,000 decrees under the powers delegated to him.

In mid-2000, a similar law enabled Hugo Chávez to legislate on issues related to the economy, reorganization of government ministries and crime for one year. Chávez did not take advantage of this act until shortly before its expiration, when he passed 49 decrees in rapid succession, many of them highly controversial. In 2007, a new enabling act granted President Chávez powers for 18 months, giving the president the ability to rule by decree over certain economic, social, territorial, defense and scientific matters as well as control over transportation, regulations for popular participation and rules for governing state institutions.

<text>The Mastacembelidae are a family of fishes, known as the spiny eels. The Mastacembelids are part of the Order Synbranchiformes, the swamp eels, which are part of the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes).

In an evaluation of the family in 2004, the subfamilies of Mastacembelidae were found to not be well supported and were rejected. Also, the genera &quot;Caecomastacembelus&quot; and &quot;Aethiomastacembelus&quot; were placed in synonymy with &quot;Mastacembelus&quot;.

These fish originate from Africa, and southern and eastern Asia. Spiny eels generally inhabit soft-bottomed habitats in fresh and occasionally brackish water. Some species burrow in the substrate during the day or for certain months and have been found buried in soil in drying periods.

These fish have an eel-like body. The largest species can reach a maximum length of . Very characteristic of this group is the long nose appendage with two tubulated nostrils. Mastacembelids have a series of well-separated dorsal spines on their back, hence the name of their family, spiny eels.

In some areas these fish are regarded as food fish. Several species of Mastacembelidae are aquarium fish, such as the fire eel.

<text>The Great Miami River (also called the Miami River) (Shawnee: Msimiyamithiipi) is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately long, in southwestern Ohio and Indiana in the United States. The Great Miami originates at the man-made Indian Lake and flows south through the cities of Sidney, Piqua, Troy, Dayton, Middletown and Hamilton.

The river is named for the Miami, an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who lived in the region during the early days of European settlement. They were forced to relocate to the west to escape pressure from European-American settlers.

The region surrounding the Great Miami River is known as the Miami Valley. This term is used in the upper portions of the valley as a moniker for the economic-cultural region centered primarily on the Greater Dayton area. As the lower portions of the Miami Valley fall under the influence of Cincinnati and the Ohio River Valley, residents of the lower area do not identify with the Miami in the same way.

==Course==
The main course of the Great Miami River rises from the outflow of Indian Lake in Logan County, about southeast of the village of Russells Point, approximately southeast of Lima. Indian Lake is an artificial reservoir which receives the flow from the North and South forks of the Great Miami River. It flows south and southwest, past Sidney, and is joined by Loramie Creek in northern Miami County. It flows south past Piqua and Troy, and through Taylorsville Dam in Huber Heights and Vandalia. It continues through Dayton, where it is joined by the Stillwater and the Mad rivers and Wolf Creek.

From Dayton it flows southwest past Miamisburg, Franklin, Middletown and Hamilton in the southwest corner of Ohio. In southwestern Hamilton County, it is joined by the Whitewater River approximately upstream from its mouth on the Ohio River, just east of the Ohio-Indiana state line, approximately west of Cincinnati. The river meanders across the state line near Lawrenceburg, Indiana in the last two miles (3 km) before reaching its mouth approximately ¼ mile east of the border in Ohio.

The border of Ohio and Indiana was based on where the confluence of the Ohio and Great Miami Rivers was in 1800.

==Natural and human history==

In the 1700s, the French called the river Riviere à la Roche (&quot;River of the Rocks&quot;). This name was directly taken from the Myaamia language (Miami-Illinois) of the Miami Nation that lived in the area (ahseni siipiiwi, meaning &quot;Rock River&quot;).

The Miami and Erie Canal, which connected the Ohio River with Lake Erie, was built through the Great Miami watershed. The first portion of the canal, from Cincinnati to Middletown, was operational in 1828, and extended to Dayton in 1830. Water from the Great Miami fed into the canal. A later extension to the canal, the Sidney Feeder, drew water from the upper reaches of the Great Miami from near Port Jefferson and Sidney. The canal served as the principal north–south route of transportation from Toledo to Cincinnati for western Ohio until being supplanted in the 1850s by railroads.

As was common in early industrial days, beginning in the 19th century the river served as a source of water and a method to dispose of wastes for a variety of major industrial firms, including Armco Steel, Champion International Paper, Black Clawson, Fernald and many others. Heightened attention to water pollution in the late 1950s and 1960s has led to significant improvements in waste disposal and water quality.

Following a catastrophic flood in March 1913, the Miami Conservancy District was established in 1914 to build dams, levees and storage areas as well as dredge and straighten channels to control flooding of the river.

<text>A unitary perfect number is an integer which is the sum of its positive proper unitary divisors, not including the number itself. (A divisor &quot;d&quot; of a number &quot;n&quot; is a unitary divisor if &quot;d&quot; and &quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot; share no common factors). The number 6 is the only number that is both a perfect number and a unitary perfect number.

The number 60 is a unitary perfect number because 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, and 20 are its proper unitary divisors, and 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 60. The first five, and only known, unitary perfect numbers are:
* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3
* formula_4, and 
*formula_5 . 
The respective sums of their proper unitary divisors are as follows:
* 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
* 60 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 12 + 15 + 20
* 90 = 1 + 2 + 5 + 9 + 10 + 18 + 45
* 87360 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 13 + 15 + 21 + 35 + 39 + 64 + 65 + 91 + 105 + 192 + 195 + 273 + 320 + 448 + 455 + 832 + 960 + 1344 + 1365 + 2240 + 2496 + 4160 + 5824 + 6720 + 12480 + 17472 + 29120
* 146361946186458562560000 = 1 + 3 + 7 + 11 + ... + 13305631471496232960000 + 20908849455208366080000 + 48787315395486187520000 (4095 divisors in the sum)

==Properties==
There are no odd unitary perfect numbers. This follows since 2&quot;d&quot;*(&quot;n&quot;) divides the sum of the unitary divisors of an odd number &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;d&quot;*(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of distinct prime factors of &quot;n&quot;. One gets this because the sum of all the unitary divisors is a multiplicative function and one has that the sum of the unitary divisors of a prime power &quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot; is &quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot; + 1 which is even for all odd primes &quot;p&quot;. Therefore, an odd unitary perfect number must have only one distinct prime factor, and it is not hard to show that a power of prime cannot be a unitary perfect number, since there are not enough divisors. 

It is not known whether or not there are infinitely many unitary perfect numbers, or indeed whether there are any further examples beyond the five already known. A sixth such number would have at least nine distinct odd prime factors.

<text>Jake Matthew Lloyd (born March 5, 1989), also known as Jake Broadbent, is an American former actor who portrayed young Anakin Skywalker in the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) and Jamie Langston in &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; (1996).

==Early life==
Jake Matthew Lloyd was born in Fort Collins, Colorado on March 5, 1989. Lloyd attended Carmel High School in Carmel, Indiana, where he graduated in 2007.

==Career==
Lloyd began his acting career in 1996, playing Jimmy Sweet in four episodes of &quot;ER&quot;. He was then cast as Jake Warren in &quot;Unhook the Stars&quot;. He got his big break playing Jamie Langston in &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;. He also played Mark Armstrong in &quot;Apollo 11&quot;. Lloyd gained worldwide fame when he was chosen by George Lucas to play the young Anakin Skywalker in the 1999 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, the first film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy. Lloyd received the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film.

In 2000, Lloyd starred in the dramas &quot;Die with Me&quot; and &quot;Madison&quot;, then retired from acting, although &quot;Madison&quot; was not released in cinemas until 2005.

===Post-&quot;Star Wars&quot; work===
After retiring from acting in 2001, Lloyd continued to make appearances at sci-fi and comic-book festivals. In 2012, he announced that he would be directing a documentary highlighting Tibetan refugees in India. Lloyd was commissioned in 2012 to create a promotional video for singer Mallory Low. &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; actor Daniel Logan, who played the young Boba Fett in the film, starred in the video. 

Lloyd left Hollywood for Chicago, and dropped out after a semester at Columbia College Chicago, where he studied film and psychology.

==Personal life==
In 2012, Lloyd stated that his decision to retire from acting in 2001 was due to bullying at school and harassment by the press, both in response to his role in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. In 2024, Lloyd&#x27;s mother, Lisa Riley, claimed that he quit acting because of family drama and that he was largely protected from the negativity surrounding his role in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. She also said that Lloyd remains a fan of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

===Mental health ===
According to Riley, Lloyd&#x27;s mental health began worsening in high school. He began suffering from delusions that he lived in multiple different &quot;realities&quot;. He was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but refused to take the medications prescribed to treat the condition. 

By college, Lloyd began suffering from visual and auditory hallucinations, causing him to miss classes and earn poor grades. He complained of people with black eyes following him and had imaginary conversations with Jon Stewart while watching &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2008, unaware of his own condition due to anosognosia despite his father&#x27;s family having a history of the illness. His sister Madison, who was an extra in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, died in her sleep from natural causes on July 16, 2018, adding to his personal struggles.

===Legal issues===
In March 2015, police responded to an alleged assault by Lloyd on Riley. In a statement to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Riley alleged Lloyd arrived at her house and began verbally berating her before physically assaulting her. She declined to press charges, stating that Lloyd had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was not taking his medication at the time. 

On June 17, 2015, Lloyd was arrested in Colleton County, South Carolina, under the name Jake Broadbent for reckless driving, driving without a license, and resisting arrest; he failed to stop for a red light while driving on a trip from Florida to Canada, which initiated a high-speed police chase across multiple counties. At a hearing on June 22, his bail was set at $10,700. Riley stated that he refused to speak with her and that the police refused to give him his psychiatric medication. She also was unable to have him transferred to a psychiatric hospital for 10 months because no beds were available. On June 23, she publicly revealed his schizophrenia diagnosis to TMZ and said that &quot;the family plans to try and get him help again ... once he&#x27;s released from jail&quot;. In April 2016, Lloyd was transferred from Colleton County Detention Center to a mental health facility.

Riley said his mental health deteriorated further after the death of his sister Madison in 2018. In January 2020, Riley and Lloyd confirmed that they had moved to California to be closer with family.

In May 2023, when Riley said Lloyd was suffering a complete &quot;psychotic break&quot;, he was arrested again after turning off Riley&#x27;s car in the middle of a busy freeway. When police attempted to talk with him, he communicated in incomprehensible word salad. Lloyd was immediately hospitalized and sent to inpatient care at a mental hospital for 18 months. In a March 2024 interview, Lloyd&#x27;s mother stated that his mental health was improving during his hospitalization.

<doc id="553050" wikidata="Q1672822" url="?curid=553050" title="Celtic Revival">
<text>The Celtic Revival (also referred to as the Celtic Twilight) is a variety of movements and trends in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries that see a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture. Artists and writers drew on the traditions of Gaelic literature, Welsh-language literature, and Celtic art—what historians call insular art (the Early Medieval style of Ireland and Britain). Although the revival was complex and multifaceted, occurring across many fields and in various countries in Northwest Europe, its best known incarnation is probably the Irish Literary Revival. Irish writers including William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, &quot;Æ&quot; Russell, Edward Martyn, Alice Milligan and Edward Plunkett (Lord Dunsany) stimulated a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature and Irish poetry in the late 19th and early 20th century.

In aspects the revival came to represent a reaction to modernisation. This is particularly true in Ireland, where the relationship between the archaic and the modern was antagonistic, where history was fractured, and where, according to Terry Eagleton, &quot;as a whole [the nation] had not leapt at a bound from tradition to modernity&quot;. At times this romantic view of the past resulted in historically inaccurate portrayals, such as the promotion of noble savage stereotypes of the Irish people and Scottish Highlanders, as well as a racialized view that referred to the Irish, whether positively or negatively, as a separate race.

A widespread and still visible result of the revival was the reintroduction of the High cross as the Celtic cross, which now forms a familiar part of monumental and funerary art over much of the Western world.

==History==
Research into the Gaelic and Brittonic cultures and histories of Britain and Ireland gathered pace from the late 18th century, by antiquaries and historians like Owen Jones in Wales and Charles O&#x27;Conor in Ireland. The key surviving manuscript sources were gradually located, edited and translated, monuments identified and published, and other essential groundwork in recording stories, music and language done.

The Welsh antiquarian and author Iolo Morganwg fed the growing fascination in all things Brittonic by founding the Gorsedd, which would in turn spark the Neo-druidism movement.

Interest in Scottish Gaelic culture greatly increased during the onset of the Romantic period in the late 18th century, with James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot; achieving international fame, along with the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the poetry and lyrics of Thomas Moore.

Throughout Europe, the Romantic movement inspired a great revival of interest in folklore, folk tales, and folk music; even Beethoven was commissioned to produce a set of arrangements of Scottish folk-songs. A growing sense of Celtic identity encouraged and fed off a rise in nationalism throughout the United Kingdom, which was especially intense in Ireland.
In the mid-19th century the revival continued, with Sir Samuel Ferguson, the Young Ireland movement, and others popularising folk tales and histories in countries and territories with Celtic roots. At the same time, archaeological and historical work was beginning to make progress in constructing a better understanding of regional history. Interest in ornamental &#x27;Celtic&#x27; art developed, and &#x27;Celtic&#x27; motifs began to be used in all sorts of contexts, including architecture, drawing on works like the &quot;Grammar of Ornament&quot; by the architect Owen Jones. Imitations of the ornate Insular penannular brooches of the 7–9th centuries were worn by figures such as Queen Victoria, many produced in Dublin by West &amp; Son and other makers.

In Scotland were John Francis Campbell&#x27;s (1821–1885) works the bilingual &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot; (4 vols., 1860–62) and &quot;The Celtic Dragon Myth&quot;, published posthumously in 1911. The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a revival in Scotland, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery, and book binding. The most significant exponent of the artistic revival in Scotland was Dundee-born John Duncan (1866–1945). Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; (1912) and &quot;St Bride&quot; (1913). Duncan also helped to make Dundee a major centre for the Celtic Revival movement along with artists such as Stewart Carmichael and the publisher Malcolm C. MacLeod.

The Irish Literary Revival encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of Irish culture, as distinct from English culture. This style fed a growing Irish identity, which also found inspiration in Irish history, myths and folklore. There was an attempt to revitalize the native rhythm and music of Irish Gaelic. Figures such as Lady Gregory, W. B. Yeats, George Russell, J .M. Synge and Seán O&#x27;Casey wrote plays and articles about the political state of Ireland. Gaelic revival and Irish nationalism frequently overlapped in places such as An Stad, a tobacconist on Dublin&#x27;s North Frederick Street owned by the writer Cathal McGarvey and frequented by literary figures like James Joyce and Yeats, along with leaders of the Nationalist movement such as Douglas Hyde, Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins. These were connected with another great symbol of the literary revival, the Abbey Theatre, which served as the stage for many new Irish writers and playwrights of the time.

In 1892, Sir Charles Gavan Duffy said,
A group of young men, among the most generous and disinterested in our annals, were busy digging up the buried relics of our history, to enlighten the present by a knowledge of the past, setting up on their pedestals anew the overthrown statues of Irish worthies, assailing wrongs which under long impunity had become unquestioned and even venerable, and warming as with strong wine the heart of the people, by songs of valour and hope; and happily not standing isolated in their pious work, but encouraged and sustained by just such an army of students and sympathizers as I see here to-day.

The Celtic Revival was an international movement. The Irish-American designer Thomas Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; O&#x27;Shaughnessy made a conscious choice to use Irish design roots in his artwork. Trained in stained glass and working in an Art Nouveau style, O&#x27;Shaughnessy designed a series of windows and interior stencils for Old Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church in Chicago, a 10-year project begun in 1912. Louis Sullivan, the Chicago architect, incorporated dense Art Nouveau and Celtic-inspired interlace in the ornament of his buildings. Sullivan&#x27;s father was a traditional Irish musician and they both were step-dancers. In England, the Watts Mortuary Chapel (1896–98) in Surrey was a thoroughgoing attempt to decorate a Romanesque Revival chapel framework with lavish Celtic reliefs designed by Mary Fraser Tytler.

The &quot;plastic style&quot; of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into Art Nouveau decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the Manxman Archibald Knox, who did much work for Liberty &amp; Co., especially for his Tudric and Cymric ranges of metalwork, respectively in pewter and silver or gold. Many of the most extravagant examples of the plastic style come from the modern Czech Lands and influenced the Czech Art Nouveau designer and artist Alphonse Mucha (Mucha, in turn, influenced the Irish-American O&#x27;Shaughnessy, who had attended a series of Mucha&#x27;s lectures in Chicago).
The interlace design motif remains popular in Celtic countries, above all Ireland where it is a national style signature. In recent decades, it had a re-revival in 1960s designs (for example, in the Biba logo) and has been used worldwide in tattoos and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-Dark Ages setting. &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot; is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.

In France, sublime descriptions of Celtic landscape were found in the works of Jacques Cambry. The Celtic Revival was strengthened by Napoleon&#x27;s idea that the &quot;French were a race of empire-building Celts,&quot; and became institutionalized by the foundation of the Académie Celtique in 1805, by Cambry and others.

John Duncan was one of the leading artists of the Celtic Revival and Symbolism. He was inspired by the early Italian Renaissance and made works in the medieval medium of tempera. He was a prolific artist working in a range of mediums including stained glass, illustrating and painting.

==Linguistic and cultural revivals, after 1920==
===In the Celtic nations===
==== Brittany ====

In 1925, Professor Roparz Hemon founded the Breton-language review &quot;Gwalarn.&quot; During its 19-year run, &quot;Gwalarn&quot; tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, &quot;Al Liamm&quot; replaced &quot;Gwalarn&quot;. Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.

In 1977, Diwan schools were founded to teach Breton by immersion. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the education section for more information.

The &quot;Asterix&quot; comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the Gaulish village where Asterix lives is in the Armorica peninsula, which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, &quot;Spirou&quot;, &quot;Titeuf&quot;, &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot;, &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Yakari&quot;.

Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, &quot;Ken Tuch&quot;, is in Breton. Radio Kerne, broadcasting from Finistère, has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (&quot;Lancelot du Lac&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, &quot;Marion du Faouet&quot;, &quot;Sezneg&quot;) and TV series (&quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;) have also been translated and broadcast in Breton. Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including Yann-Ber Kalloc&#x27;h, Roparz Hemon, Anjela Duval, Xavier de Langlais, Pêr-Jakez Helias, Youenn Gwernig, Glenmor and Alan Stivell are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living Celtic language that is not recognized by national government as an official or regional language.

The first Breton dictionary, the &quot;Catholicon&quot;, was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation[&quot;&quot;] is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, &quot;Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here&quot; (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.

In the early 21st century, the &quot;Ofis ar Brezhoneg&quot; (&quot;Office of the Breton language&quot;) began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the Spilhennig to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an Internationalization and localization policy asking Google, Firefox and SPIP to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the Breton Wikipedia started, which now counts more than 87,000 articles. In March 2007, the &quot;Ofis ar Brezhoneg&quot; signed a tripartite agreement with Regional Council of Brittany and Microsoft for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, Facebook added Breton as one of its 121 languages, after three years of talks between the &quot;Ofis&quot; and Facebook. On 27 June 2024, thanks to the use of Artificial Intelligence, Google Translate added Breton to its roster of available languages.

====Cornwall====

The Cornish cultural Celtic revival of the early twentieth century was characterised by an increased interest in the Cornish language started by Henry Jenner and Robert Morton Nance in 1904. The Federation of Old Cornwall Societies was formed in 1924 to &quot;maintain the Celtic spirit of Cornwall&quot;, followed by the Gorseth Kernow in 1928 and the formation of the Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow in 1951.

====Ireland====
Due to the revival of Irish in educational settings and bilingual upbringing, there has been an increase in young Irish people speaking the language in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is said it is more common to hear it spoken in Irish cities. Additionally, there is a modest revived interest in North America in learning Irish.

====Isle of Man====

====Scotland====

====Wales====
The Welsh language has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history, and in recent centuries had been the most widely spoken Celtic language by far. By 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by merely 43.5% of the Welsh population. While this decline continued over the following decades, the language did not die out. By the start of the 21st century, numbers began to increase once more.

The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7% of the population of Wales spoke Welsh, compared with 20.8% in the 2001 census, and 18.5% in 1991. The 2011 census, however, showed a slight decline to 562,000, or 19% of the population.
The census also showed a &quot;big drop&quot; in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50% in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire for the first time. According to the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013-15, 24% of people aged three and over were able to speak Welsh.

Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh. Over the course of the 20th century this monolingual population &quot;all but disappeared&quot;, but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census. In Wales, 16% of state school pupils now receive a Welsh medium education, and Welsh is a compulsory subject in English medium schools, up to the age of 15-16.

=== Americas ===
==== Welsh in Argentina ====
Welsh is spoken by over 5,000 people in Chubut province of Argentina. Some districts have recently incorporated it as an educational language.

==== Nova Scotia ====

Nova Scotia holds the largest population of Scots Gaelic speakers outside of Scotland.

===France===
The Gaulish language used to be widely spoken in France and beyond around the period of the Roman Empire. There have been attempts at revivals and reconstructions, despite very limited evidence for the exact original form of the language. Eluveitie is a folk metal band that writes songs in revived form of Gaulish.

==== Auvergne ====
In Auvergne, chants are sung around bonfires remembering a Celtic god. There are also modern attempts to revive the polytheistic religion of the Gauls.

Auvergne is also a hotpot for the Gaulish revival movement, being the location of numerous important Gaulish sites and the home of the legendary Gaulish warrior, Vercingetorix.

=== Elsewhere in Europe ===
The Celtic cultural revivals in Cornwall have spread towards Northern England, with the attempted reconstructions of numerous types of bagpipe (such as the Lancashire Great-pipe) and an increased interest in the Northumbrian smallpipes. There are also attempts to reconstruct the Cumbric language, the ancient Brythonic language of Northern (particularly Northwestern) England, a remnant of the Brittonic kingdoms of Hen Ogledd.

There are small areas of Celtic revival in Galicia (Spain).

<text>Tchintabaraden (var. Tchin-Tabaraden, Tchin Tabaraden) is a town and commune located in the Azawagh area of Niger, in the north of the Tahoua Region. It is the capital of the region&#x27;s Tchintabaraden Department. It is the market center for the Iwellemmedan Tuareg. The first insurrectionist movement for the autonomy of Tenere, the Tuareg region in central-north and western Niger, began here and in nearby Abalagh in 1985. In the neighboring oasis of In-Gall, the Cure Salee, or &quot;the festival of the nomads&quot;, is held annually.

The name means &quot;valley of the young girls&quot;. It was so named due to the former practice of all of the young women and girls going to the large well in town to draw water daily. With running water, this is no longer a needed ritual.

As of 2012, it had a population of 79,889.

<text>Ohio is a Midwestern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. The state takes its name from the Ohio River, whose name in turn originated from the Seneca word &quot; ohiːyo&quot;&#x27;, meaning &quot;good river&quot;, &quot;great river&quot; or &quot;large creek&quot;. The Ohio River forms its southern border, though nearly all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia.

Significant rivers within the state include the Cuyahoga River, Great Miami River, Maumee River, Muskingum River, and Scioto River. The rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence River, and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio River and then the Mississippi.

The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913. Known as the Great Dayton Flood, the entire Miami River watershed flooded, including the downtown business district of Dayton. As a result, the Miami Conservancy District was created as the first major flood plain engineering project in Ohio and the United States.

<text>Traunstein (Central Bavarian: &quot;Traunstoa&quot;) is a town in the south-eastern part of Bavaria, Germany, and is the administrative center of a much larger district of the same name. The town serves as a local government, retail, health services, transport and educational center for the wider district.

The historic market square, Bavarian hospitality, local breweries, outdoor sports facilities, Easter Monday horse parade, and connections with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, contribute to the town&#x27;s profile as a tourist destination.

==Geography==
The town is situated at the heart of a region called Chiemgau, approximately 11 km east of the Chiemsee between Munich and Salzburg, 15 km north of the Alps, and 30 km west of Salzburg.

==History==

===Early history===
Although as early as 790 the church records list possessions &quot;ad Trun&quot; and some medieval defence constructions are known to have existed in the surroundings since the 10th century, &quot;Trauwenstein&quot; itself was first mentioned in a manuscript of the Baumburg monastery in the year 1245. The name means &quot;castle on the Traun&quot;, and the domicile of the Lord of &quot;de Truna&quot;, surrounded by a little settlement, was probably located there.

The Wittelsbachs (a German/Bavarian dynastic and European royal family) were the first to expand and fortify the settlement. In that way they controlled the passage of the important commercial salt route over the Traun, from Bad Reichenhall to Munich at the border of the &quot;Erzstift Salzburg&quot; (the archbishopric of Salzburg). In the year 1120 the lords of &quot;Truna&quot; settled in the current urban area because of its favourable strategic position. They built the castle at the border of the city plateau, which is surrounded by the River Traun as well as its close proximity to the main route of commerce.

Traunstein has been part of the state of Bavaria since 1275. It was previously a territory of Salzburg. At the beginning of the 14th century, Traunstein was granted the status of a town. By 1493 the town roads were already cobbled. The Church of St. Oswald was rebuilt in 1501. In 1526 the &quot;Lindlbrunnen&quot; (Lindl Fountain) was constructed as a completion of the town&#x27;s water supply.

In the 17th century, salt production, facilitated by the construction of a wooden brine pipeline from Bad Reichenhall brought new industry and significant wealth to the town. The pipeline was constructed between 1616 and 1619 by the master builder of the court, Hans Reiffenstuel.

Traunstein was spared much of the damage experienced by nearby towns during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). 

On 25 and 26 July 1704, Austrian troops occupied the town in the course of the Spanish war of succession. 
A disastrous fire altered the medieval townscape. Despite the occupation by Austrian troops, it was possible for Traunstein to be reconstructed. The saltworks, finished in 1786/87, assured the survival of salt production in Traunstein.

===Town fires===
In its history, Traunstein was struck at least twice by significant town fires: In 1704, when Hungarian &quot;Panduren&quot; set the town on fire in the course of the Spanish War of Succession, and in 1851. However, the &quot;first town fire&quot;, which is still familiar to all &quot;real&quot; citizens of Traunstein and is still taught in school today, has not been confirmed. Only archaeological excavations can show whether Traunstein had really suffered a fire disaster before 1400. Written documents provide no information about it. They merely report about a fire, which broke out later, in 1851. At any rate, only 10 houses fell victim to the early fire and in no case the whole town. Thereupon, in 1587, a fire arrangement was enacted for the first time in the town history.

During the night of 25-26 April 1851, a disastrous fire again destroyed almost the whole town. The reason for it has never been discovered. The great fires spread to almost 100 houses including the Town Hall, the County Court, the Main Salt Office, the Pension Office, the Church, and several gates and towers except the Upper Tower. Just as in 1704, Traunstein was again rebuilt within a few years. It was presumed the fire was an act of revenge by the angry Haslachers. There were feelings of rage because the parochial seat was taken away from Haslach and was given to Traunstein. Later rumours came up that the carelessness of a resident had caused the fire. However, there was no evidence to support that idea and therefore the person could not be sentenced.

After the town fire 700 citizens were homeless but help immediately reached Traunstein. King Maximilian II visited Traunstein on 27 April, contributed consolations and gave several thousands of guilders from his cabinet cash. In return for the quick payment of the fire insurance the inhabitants could soon begin to rebuild their town from the ground up. The medieval plan of the town square was preserved to a great extent; merely the façades received a new face in the style of the current time.

===1900 to present===
Salt production in Traunstein was finally shut down in 1912. In 1914, the former independent community &quot;Au&quot; became part of Traunstein.

During the First World War what had previously been the site of the salt production facilities became a camp for over 1000 civilian prisoners and prisoners of war. After the war, the 1923 hyperinflation crisis as in other towns lead to the use of token money denominated in billions.

With the seizure of power of the National Socialists in 1933 began an active period of persecution for political dissidents and Jewish fellow citizens in Germany. By November 1938 all Jewish residents of the town had been forcibly removed. Open political resistance during the war years was limited; the town priest, Josef Stelze, was placed briefly in custody, Rupert Berger, Bavarian People&#x27;s Party representative and the first post-war elected Mayor of Traunstein, was for a period incarcerated in the Dachau concentration camp. In 1939 Traunstein had an estimated population of 11,500. By the end of the war 523 of that number were registered as killed as a direct result of the conflict, a further 73 registered as missing.

During the later stages of the Second World War Traunstein was four times the target of U.S. Army Air Force aerial bombardment: on 11 November 1944, on 21 January 1945, on 18 April 1945 and finally on 25 April 1945. In April 1945 the heavy air raids destroyed much of the Traunstein station area, an event in which over 100 people died. A short time later, a death march with a few SS guards accompanied by 61 prisoners from the already-liberated Buchenwald concentration camp arrived; and on 5 May a massacre was carried out, resulting in 60 deaths, and only one survivor. Currently in Surberg lies a memorial commemorating their deaths. On 3 May 1945 the town surrendered without struggle.

During World War II, a subcamp of Dachau concentration camp was located here. Whereas Traunstein was a district-free city from 1948–1972, it became capital of the district of the same name in 1972.

Areas of Traunstein close to the River Traun have been subject to flooding on numerous occasions, most notably in 1899 and again in 2013.

<doc id="553098" wikidata="Q977342" url="?curid=553098" title="Indian Lake (Ohio)">
<text>Indian Lake (formerly &quot;Lewistown Reservoir&quot;) is a reservoir in Logan County, western Ohio, in the United States. It is approximately southeast of Lima. It is fed by the north and south forks of the Upper Great Miami River, Cherokee Mans Run, Blackhawk Creek, and Van Horn Creek. The outlet of the lake, at the bulkhead or &quot;spillway&quot; (located at what is now State Route 366) built in the 1850s by Irish laborers, is the beginning of the Great Miami River. At , Indian Lake is the second largest inland lake in Ohio.

Indian Lake has numerous islands, including the &quot;Indian Isles&quot; chain that arcs through the center of the Lake, expansive wildlife areas accessible by a network of channels, numerous inlets and bays, and approximately of shoreline. The lake, and adjoining Oldfield Beach (the end point of a several mile, lake-front biking/walking trail), Moundwood and Lakeview Harbor boat ramps, marinas at Moundwood and at Cherokee Campgrounds, and other greenspaces including Pew Island, are managed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources as part of the Ohio state park system. Popular state walking trails are located, in addition to the one ending at Oldfield Beach, at Pew Island and at the Cherokee Campgrounds.

In its early days extending into the middle of the 20th century, the lake was primarily a destination resort, with many waterfront cottages being lightly built primarily for summer use. Many knew of it as the location of the amusement park with its roller-coaster and other rides and a dancehall, discussed below. While still busiest in the summer, since the late 20th century the lakefront has become developed as an area of second or retirement homes, with many new permanent houses, and remodeling of numerous older cottages.

==History==
Early settlers found a group of small lakes and wetlands, occupying about , and named them for the Indian tribes living in the region. The area was ideal for fishing and hunting, but in the 1850s it was converted into the &quot;Lewistown Reservoir,&quot; in order to collect water for the Sidney Feeder to the Miami and Erie Canal, which extended from Toledo to Cincinnati. Within a few years after its construction, the canal system became an obsolete form of transportation compared to the new and growing railways.

However, Indian Lake remained. It was well served by the railways, and has become a destination for leisure activities and recreation such as fishing and boating. In its early years, the lake had bass as a prize catch for fishermen, with bluegill and crappies being caught in great numbers. Since the mid-20th century, the lake has been stocked with fish including saugeye, for which it has been nationally recognized. Several major fishing tournaments are held each year, with local bass clubs holding weekly contests. Generally these follow &quot;catch and return&quot; rules.

On March 14, 2024, many communities around Indian Lake, such as Russells Point, Ohio and Orchard Island, Ohio, were struck by a large, considerable tornado. Some fatalities were reported, many injuries occurred and a large amount of damage to homes and businesses has been reported. A mobile home park located between Lakeview and Russell&#x27;s Point suffered a direct hit from the tornado. Schools in Indian Lake were closed as a result of the tornado and resultant power outages, but the facilities were opened as shelters for those with damaged homes. The tornado was later classified after a NWS damage survey as an EF-3 tornado.

==Sandy Beach Park==

A major part of the lake&#x27;s history is the amusement park and dancehall once in Russells Point, advertised as the &quot;Midwest&#x27;s Million Dollar Playground&quot;. Pappy Wilgus, a Russells Point resident, built Sandy Beach Amusement Park, which opened to the public on May 29, 1924. It was promoted as the &quot;Atlantic City of the West&quot;. They erected a &quot;out and back&quot; wooden roller coaster, built by the National Amusement Device Company, known variously as &quot;Coaster&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Big Dipper&quot; and &quot;Silver Streak&quot; through the years. The park offered a penny arcade, a carousel, a millrace ride, a Ferris wheel, a funhouse, boat excursions, and a boardwalk to Sandy Beach Island for swimming.

A major attraction was the Minnewawa Dance Hall. With two bandstands and room for hundreds of couples, the park claimed it was the largest and best dance hall in Ohio. Famous orchestras such as those led by Paul Whiteman and Rudy Vallée packed in the crowds. Sandy Beach was a great success even during the Great Depression, and hosted many dance marathons in the 1920s and early 1930s. The 1931 National Endurance Dance Marathon, held in Minnewawa, lasted an incredible 80 days, 2 hours. When a fire destroyed much of the wooden structures of the park in 1935, the park was sold to new owners. They invested $100,000 in rebuilding, including replacing Minnewawa Dance Hall with the Moonlight Terrace Gardens. Crowds continued to come through the 1950s. Over 100,000 attended the 1953 Ohio Sesquicentennial celebration at Indian Lake.

The park and dancehall began to deteriorate and decline in the 1950s, as attendance fell due to people having more choices and access by personal cars. The park was renamed &quot;San Juan Amusement Park&quot;, inspired by a vintage neon sign &quot;San Juan Hotel&quot; located near the park&#x27;s entrance. On the evening of July 4, 1961, rowdies at Russells Point bars across the street started fighting - and before the evening was over, there was a riot involving nearly 500 youths. For nearly a decade, there were repeats of the Independence Day weekend riots. Families chose to go to safer destinations, and motorcycle gangs were attracted to the disruption and came to be part of it. The park management fought back, increasing their security budget, and when it appeared that they had turned the corner on the violence, they renamed the park &quot;Indian Lake Playland&quot; in 1967. An illuminated slowly revolving statue of the Virgin Mary was erected at the park in 1964 adjacent to the lake in an effort to bring families back. The statue, still locally maintained, remains there to this day.

But large, modern new parks at Cedar Point and Kings Island, each within about a two-hour drive, drew away customers. Seeing the success of Disneyland in Anaheim, California, investors in Sandusky, Ohio, made massive investments in Cedar Point in the 1960s. In 1972, the Taft family (Taft Broadcasting) relocated some rides from Coney Island Amusement Park on the banks of the Ohio River 10 miles east of downtown Cincinnati to Kings Mills, Ohio, where they provided the start for a major new theme park known as Kings Island. The Indian Lake park bought a second roller coaster, one of the popular Ben Schiff &quot;Wild Mouse&quot; coasters, but it was to no avail. The park sold the steel coaster, replacing it with a giant multicolored steel slide, before closing down in 1975. The wooden coaster and other rides continued to deteriorate and sit idle until the park was razed in 1982 after the property was purchased in 1981. Many of the dismantled kiddie rides and other park memorabilia were auctioned off prior to the park&#x27;s demolition. Much of the property has been privately developed.

The park was divided by a channel, the entrance to the Russells Point harbor, with a 1920s footbridge connecting the two sides. A lack of maintenance led to the bridge&#x27;s closing decades later, though it remained standing. Private residential development has taken place on former parkland, and condos and apartments line the water. Local fundraising and grants allowed the bridge to be re-lighted in 2010, and in 2014 the bridge was renovated with brick walkways and reopened to the public in a ceremony on August 23, 2014.

==The Area==
Two villages are located on the lake: Russells Point on the south end, and Lakeview about to the northwest along U.S. 33. Other parts of the lake area are within various other government areas: a large part of the lake area is within Stokes Township, while some of the south side is part of Washington Township and some of the east side is part of Richland Township. Its location in the northwestern corner of Logan County places it near Roundhead Township in Hardin County, Goshen Township and Clay Township in Auglaize County, and Jackson Township in Shelby County. Not surprisingly, mail directed to the lake area contains various zip codes.

Many unincorporated but well-known areas are part of the lake community: Crystal Beach Island, Wolf and Orchard Islands, Artists&#x27; Isle, Waterbury, Dunn&#x27;s Pond, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Point, Lake Breeze, Long Island, Avondale, King&#x27;s Landing, Turkeyfoot and Sassafras Points, Chippewa and Blackhawk, and the many islands and areas comprising the Indian Isles: Lake Ridge, Shawnee, Seminole, Cranberry Bay, Miami, Tecumseh, and Minnewauken.

Local low-power FM station WRPO in Russells Point serves the lake area; it is operated by a community-minded citizen.

==Traditions==
The lake calendar begins with Jimmy Buffett weekend in the first week of February, followed by the annual Boat Show the first weekend in March. An ever-growing fireworks display, part of July 4 observances, is witnessed by people on hundreds of boats as well as crowds along the shores. The &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, on the Sunday evening of Labor Day weekend, by lore extends an Indian tradition in celebration of the harvest. Some event, whether a restored Chris-Craft boat show, a fishing tournament, or charity &quot;poker runs&quot; around the lake, is scheduled on almost every summer weekend. Local folklore refers to an abandoned lead mine under the lake, and use of the north side of the lake and the dancehall by Chicago mobsters in days gone by.

<doc id="553101" wikidata="Q1212494" url="?curid=553101" title="The Fly (1958 film)">
<text>The Fly is a 1958 American science fiction horror film and the first installment in &quot;The Fly&quot; film series. The film was produced and directed by Kurt Neumann and stars David Hedison, Patricia Owens, Vincent Price, and Herbert Marshall. The screenplay by James Clavell is based on the 1957 short story of the same name by George Langelaan.

The film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque human–fly hybrid after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter with which he is experimenting, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect. The film was released in CinemaScope by 20th Century Fox, with color by Deluxe. It was followed by two black-and-white sequels, &quot;Return of the Fly&quot; (1959) and &quot;Curse of the Fly&quot; (1965). A remake directed by David Cronenberg was released in 1986.

It was released in 1958 as a double feature with &quot;Space Master X-7&quot;.

== Plot ==
In Montreal, Quebec, scientist André Delambre is found dead with his head and arm crushed in a hydraulic press. His wife Hélène confesses to the crime but refuses to provide a motive, and begins acting strangely. In particular, she is obsessed with flies, including a supposedly white-headed fly. André&#x27;s brother, François, lies and says he caught the white-headed fly. Thinking he knows the truth, Hélène asks François to bring the policeman in charge of the case, Inspector Charas, so that she can explain the circumstances of André&#x27;s death to them both.

In flashback, André, Hélène, and their son Philippe are a happy family. André has been working on a matter-transporter device called the disintegrator-integrator. He initially tests it only on small, inanimate objects, such as a newspaper. Still, he then proceeds to living creatures, including the family&#x27;s pet cat (which fails to reintegrate but can be heard meowing somewhere) and a guinea pig. After he is satisfied that these tests are succeeding, he builds a man-sized pair of chambers.

One day, Hélène, worried because André has not come up from the basement lab for a couple of days, goes down to find André with a black cloth draped over his head and a strange deformity on his left hand. Communicating only with typed notes and knocking, André tells Hélène that he tried to transport himself, but that a fly was caught in the chamber with him, which resulted in the mixing of their atoms. Now, he has the head and left arm of a fly, though he retains his human mind. Conversely, the fly has his miniature head and left arm.

André needs Hélène to capture the fly so that he can reverse the process. After she, her son, and their housemaid exhaustively search for it, she finds it, but it slips out of a crack in the window. André&#x27;s will begins to fade as the fly&#x27;s instincts take over his brain. Time is running out, and while André can still think like a human, he smashes the equipment, burns his notes, and leads Hélène to the factory. When they arrive, he sets the hydraulic press, puts his head and arm under, and motions for Hélène to push the button. André&#x27;s arm falls free as the press descends, and trying not to look, she raises the press, replaces the arm, and activates the machine a second time.

Upon hearing this confession, Inspector Charas deems Hélène insane and guilty of murder. As they are about to haul her away, Philippe tells François he has seen the fly trapped in a web in the back garden. François convinces the inspector to come and see for himself. The two men see the fly, with both André&#x27;s head and arm, trapped on the web as Philippe told them. It screams, &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; as a large spider advances on it. Just as the spider is about to devour the creature, Charas crushes them both with a rock. Knowing that nobody would believe the truth, François and Charas decide to declare André&#x27;s death a suicide so that Hélène is not convicted of murder.

In the end, Hélène, François, and Philippe resume their daily lives. Sometime later, Philippe and Hélène are playing croquet in the yard. François arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew&#x27;s query about his father&#x27;s death, François tells Philippe, &quot;He was searching for the truth. He almost found a great truth, but for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous&quot;. The film closes with Hélène escorting her son and François out of the yard.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Producer-director Kurt Neumann discovered the short story by George Langelaan in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. He showed it to Robert L. Lippert, head of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s subsidiary B-movie studio, Regal Films. The film was to be made by Lippert&#x27;s outfit, but was released as an &quot;official&quot; Fox film, not under the less-prestigious Regal banner.

Lippert hired James Clavell to adapt Langelaan&#x27;s story on the strength of a previous sci-fi spec script at RKO, which had never been produced. It became Clavell&#x27;s first filmed screenplay. As Harry Spalding recalled, the script was &quot;the best first draft I ever saw, it needed very little work&quot;.

The adaptation remained largely faithful to Langelaan&#x27;s short story, apart from moving its setting from France to Canada, and crafting a happier ending by eliminating a suicide.

=== Casting ===
Lippert tried to cast Michael Rennie and Rick Jason in the role of André Delambre, before settling on then mostly unknown David Hedison (billed as &quot;Al Hedison&quot; on-screen). Hedison&#x27;s &quot;Fly&quot; costume featured a fly&#x27;s head, about which he said: &quot;Trying to act in it was like trying to play the piano with boxing gloves on&quot;. Hedison was never happy with the makeup, but makeup artist Ben Nye remained very positive about his work, writing years later that despite doing many subsequent science-fiction films, &quot;I never did anything as sophisticated or original as &quot;The Fly&quot;&quot;.

Years later, Vincent Price recalled the cast finding some levity during the filming: &quot;We were playing this kind of philosophical scene, and every time that little voice [of the fly] would say &#x27;Help me! Help me!&#x27; we would just scream with laughter. It was terrible. It took us about 20 takes to finally get it&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Sources vary as to the budget, with one giving it as $350,000, another as $325,000, and others as high as $495,000. The shoot lasted 18 days in total. Lippert said the budget was $480,000. Photographic effects were handled by L. B. Abbott, with makeup by Ben Nye.

It was photographed in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s trademarked CinemaScope with color by Deluxe. A $28,000 laboratory set was constructed from army surplus equipment.

== Release ==
&quot;The Fly&quot; was released in July 1958 by 20th Century Fox. Producer-director Kurt Neumann died only a few weeks after its premiere, never realizing he had made the biggest hit of his career. One source claims it was on a double bill with &quot;Space Master X-7&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film was a commercial success, grossing $3 million at the domestic box office against a budget less than $500,000, and becoming one of the biggest hits of the year for Fox studios. It earned $1.7 million in theatrical rentals. Lippert claimed it earned $4 million.

The film&#x27;s financial success had the side effect of boosting co-star Vincent Price (whose previous filmography featured only scattered forays into genre film) into a major horror star. Price himself was positive about the film, saying, decades later, &quot;I thought &quot;THE FLY&quot; was a wonderful film – entertaining and great fun&quot;.

===Critical response===

Upon its initial release, &quot;The Fly&quot; received mixed reviews. Critic Ivan Butler called the film &quot;the most ludicrous, and certainly one of the most revolting science-horror films ever perpetrated&quot;, and Carlos Clarens offered some praise for the effects, but concluded that the film &quot;collapses under the weight of many... questions&quot;. A mixed review in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;The early sequences of this film have great mystery and tension, and the situation is ingeniously built up. But the film soon becomes as nauseating as its bare outline suggests; even the moments which in healthier pictures might provoke a laugh through sheer absurdity offer little relief&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Howard Thompson was more positive, writing: &quot;It does indeed contain, briefly, two of the most sickening sights one casual swatter-wielder ever beheld on the screen... Otherwise, believe it or not, &quot;The Fly&quot; happens to be one of the better, more restrained entries of the &quot;shock&quot; school... Even with the laboratory absurdities, it holds an interesting philosophy about man&#x27;s tampering with the unknown&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; was also fairly positive: &quot;One strong factor of the picture is its unusual believability. It is told, by Clavell and Neumann, as a mystery suspense story, so that it has a compelling interest aside from its macabre effects&quot;. &quot;A first rate science-fiction-horror melodrama&quot;, declared &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, adding, &quot;the action grips one&#x27;s attention from the opening to the closing scenes, and is filled with suspenseful, spine-chilling situations that will keep movie-goers on the edge of their seats&quot;. Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;frightening, which is naturally its primary purpose. It is also more skillful in concept and execution than the average science-fiction effort&quot;.

Modern reviews have been more uniformly positive. The film holds a 95% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with the consensus: &quot;Deliciously funny to some and eerily presicient to others, &quot;The Fly&quot; walks a fine line between shlocky fun and unnerving nature parable&quot;. &quot;Cinefantastique&#x27;s&quot; Steve Biodrowski declared that &quot;the film, though hardly a masterpiece, stands in many ways above the level of B-movie science fiction common in the 1950s&quot;. Critic Steven H. Scheuer praised it as a &quot;superior science-fiction thriller with a literate script for a change, plus good production effects and capable performances&quot;. &quot;The Fly&quot; was nominated for the 1959 Hugo Award for Best SF or Fantasy Movie at the 17th World Science Fiction Convention.

===Year-end lists===
American Film Institute Lists
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – nominated

===Legacy===
The success of the film encouraged Lippert to hire Clavell to make his directorial debut with &quot;Five Gates to Hell&quot; (1959).

==Other media==
===Sequels===

The film spawned two sequels, &quot;Return of the Fly&quot; (1959) and &quot;Curse of the Fly&quot; (1965).

===Remake series===

A remake, also titled &quot;The Fly&quot;, was directed by David Cronenberg and released in 1986. A sequel, &quot;The Fly II&quot;, was released in 1989 without Cronenberg&#x27;s involvement.

<doc id="553114" wikidata="Q1413955" url="?curid=553114" title="TATA box">
<text>In molecular biology, the TATA box (also called the Goldberg–Hogness box) is a sequence of DNA found in the core promoter region of genes in archaea and eukaryotes. The bacterial homolog of the TATA box is called the Pribnow box which has a shorter consensus sequence.

The TATA box is considered a non-coding DNA sequence (also known as a cis-regulatory element). It was termed the &quot;TATA box&quot; as it contains a consensus sequence characterized by repeating T and A base pairs. How the term &quot;box&quot; originated is unclear. In the 1980s, while investigating nucleotide sequences in mouse genome loci, the Hogness box sequence was found and &quot;boxed in&quot; at the -31 position. When consensus nucleotides and alternative ones were compared, homologous regions were &quot;boxed&quot; by the researchers. The boxing in of sequences sheds light on the origin of the term &quot;box&quot;.

The TATA box was first identified in 1978 as a component of eukaryotic promoters. Transcription is initiated at the TATA box in TATA-containing genes. The TATA box is the binding site of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other transcription factors in some eukaryotic genes. Gene transcription by RNA polymerase II depends on the regulation of the core promoter by long-range regulatory elements such as enhancers and silencers. Without proper regulation of transcription, eukaryotic organisms would not be able to properly respond to their environment.

Based on the sequence and mechanism of TATA box initiation, mutations such as insertions, deletions, and point mutations to this consensus sequence can result in phenotypic changes. These phenotypic changes can then turn into a disease phenotype. Some diseases associated with mutations in the TATA box include gastric cancer, spinocerebellar ataxia, Huntington&#x27;s disease, blindness, β-thalassemia, immunosuppression, Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome, and HIV-1. The TATA-binding protein (TBP) could also be targeted by viruses as a means of viral transcription.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===
The TATA box was the first eukaryotic core promoter motif to be identified in 1978 by American biochemist David Hogness while he and his graduate student, Michael Goldberg were on sabbatical at the University of Basel in Switzerland. They first discovered the TATA sequence while analyzing 5&#x27; DNA promoter sequences in &quot;Drosophila,&quot; mammalian, and viral genes. The TATA box was found in protein coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II.

=== Evolutionary history ===
Most research on the TATA box has been conducted on yeast, human, and &quot;Drosophila&quot; genomes, however, similar elements have been found in archaea and ancient eukaryotes. In archaea species, the promoter contains an 8 bp AT-rich sequence located ~24 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This sequence was originally called Box A, which is now known to be the sequence that interacts with the homologue of the archaeal TATA-binding protein (TBP). Also, even though some studies have uncovered several similarities, there are others that have detected notable differences between archaeal and eukaryotic TBP. The archaea protein exhibits a greater symmetry in its primary sequence and in the distribution of electrostatic charge, which is important because the higher symmetry lowers the protein&#x27;s ability to bind the TATA box in a polar manner.

Even though the TATA box is present in many eukaryotic promoters, it is not contained in the majority of promoters. One study found less than 30% of 1031 potential promoter regions contain a putative TATA box motif in humans. In &quot;Drosophila,&quot; less than 40% of 205 core promoters contain a TATA box. When there is an absence of the TATA box and TBP is not present, the downstream promoter element (DPE) in cooperation with the initiator element (Inr) bind to the transcription factor II D (TFIID), initiating transcription in TATA-less promoters. The DPE has been identified in three &quot;Drosophila&quot; TATA-less promoters and in the TATA-less human IRF-1 promoter.

== Features ==

=== Location ===
Promoter sequences vary between bacteria and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, the TATA box is located 25 base pairs upstream of the start site that Rpb4/Rbp7 use to initiate transcription. In metazoans, the TATA box is located 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. While in yeast, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, the TATA box has a variable position which can range from 40 to 100 bp upstream of the start site. The TATA box is also found in 40% of the core promoters of genes that code for the actin cytoskeleton and contractile apparatus in cells.

The type of core promoter affects the level of transcription and expression of a gene. TATA-binding protein (TBP) can be recruited in two ways, by SAGA, a cofactor for RNA polymerase II, or by TFIID. When promoters use the SAGA/TATA box complex to recruit RNA polymerase II, they are more highly regulated and display higher expression levels than promoters using the TFIID/TBP mode of recruitment.

=== Analogous sequences ===
In bacteria, promoter regions may contain a Pribnow box, which serves an analogous purpose to the eukaryotic TATA box. The Pribnow box has a 6 bp region centered around the -10 position and an 8-12 bp sequence around the -35 region that are both conserved.

A CAAT box (also CAT box) is a region of nucleotides with the following consensus sequence: 5’ GGCCAATCT 3’. The CAAT box is located about 75-80 bases upstream of the transcription initiation site and about 150 bases upstream of the TATA box. It binds transcription factors (CAAT TF or CTFs) and thereby stabilizes the nearby preinitiation complex for easier binding of RNA polymerases. CAAT boxes are rarely found in genes that express proteins ubiquitous in all cell types.

== Structure ==

=== Sequence and prevalence ===

The TATA box is a component of the eukaryotic core promoter and generally contains the consensus sequence 5&#x27;-TATA(A/T)A(A/T)-3&#x27;. In yeast, for example, one study found that various &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; genomes had the consensus sequence 5&#x27;-TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(A/G)-3&#x27;, yet only about 20% of yeast genes even contained the TATA sequence. Similarly, in humans only 24% of genes have promoter regions containing the TATA box. Genes containing the TATA-box tend to be involved in stress-responses and certain types of metabolism and are more highly regulated when compared to TATA-less genes. Generally, TATA-containing genes are not involved in essential cellular functions such as cell growth, DNA replication, transcription, and translation because of their highly regulated nature.

The TATA box is usually located 25-35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Genes containing the TATA box usually require additional promoter elements, including an initiator site located just upstream of the transcription start site and a downstream core element (DCE). These additional promoter regions work in conjunction with the TATA box to regulate initiation of transcription in eukaryotes.

== Function ==

=== Role in transcription initiation ===
The TATA-box is the site of preinitiation complex formation, which is the first step in transcription initiation in eukaryotes. Formation of the preinitiation complex begins when the multi-subunit transcription factor II D (TFIID) binds to the TATA box at its TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit. TBP binds to the minor groove of the TATA box via a region of antiparallel β sheets in the protein. Three types of molecular interactions contribute to TBP binding to the TATA box:
# Four phenylalanine residues(Phe57, Phe74, Phe148, Phe165) on TBP bind to DNA and form kinks in the DNA, forcing the DNA minor groove open.
# Four hydrogen bonds form between polar side chains on TBP amino acid (Asn27, Asn117, Thr82, Thr173)( and bases in the minor groove.
# Numerous hydrophobic interactions(~15) form between TBP residues(notably Ile152 and Leu163) and DNA bases, including van der Waals forces.
Additionally, binding of TBP is facilitated by stabilizing interactions with DNA flanking the TATA box, which consists of G-C rich sequences. These secondary interactions induce bending of the DNA and helical unwinding. The degree of DNA bending is species and sequence dependent. For example, one study used the adenovirus TATA promoter sequence (5&#x27;-CGCTATAAAAGGGC-3&#x27;) as a model binding sequence and found that human TBP binding to the TATA box induced a 97° bend toward the major groove while the yeast TBP protein only induced an 82° bend. X-ray crystallography studies of TBP/TATA-box complexes generally agree that the DNA goes through an ~80° bend during the process of TBP-binding.

The conformational changes induced by TBP binding to the TATA box allows for additional transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to bind to the promoter region. TFIID first binds to the TATA box, facilitated by TFIIA binding to the upstream part of the TFIID complex. TFIIB then binds to the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA complex through interactions both upstream and downstream of the TATA box. RNA polymerase II is then recruited to this multi-protein complex with the help of TFIIF. Additional transcription factors then bind, first TFIIE and then TFIIH. This completes the assembly of the preinitiation complex for eukaryotic transcription. Generally, the TATA box is found at RNA polymerase II promoter regions, although some &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have demonstrated that RNA polymerase III can recognize TATA sequences.

This cluster of RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors is known as the basal transcriptional complex (BTC). In this state, it only gives a low level of transcription. Other factors must stimulate the BTC to increase transcription levels. One such example of a BTC stimulating region of DNA is the CAAT box. Additional factors, including the Mediator complex, transcriptional regulatory proteins, and nucleosome-modifying enzymes also enhance transcription &quot;in vivo&quot;.

=== Interactions ===
In specific cell types or on specific promoters TBP can be replaced by one of several TBP-related factors (TRF1 in Drosophila, TBPL1/TRF2 in metazoans, TBPL2/TRF3 in vertebrates), some of which interact with the TATA box similar to TBP. Interaction of TATA boxes with a variety of activators or repressors can influence the transcription of genes in many ways. Enhancers are long-range regulatory elements that increase promoter activity while silencers repress promoter activity.

== Mutations ==

Mutations to the TATA box can range from a deletion or insertion to a point mutation with varying effects based on the gene that has been mutated. The mutations change the binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) for transcription initiation. Thus, there is a resulting change in phenotype based on the gene that is not being expressed (Figure 3).

=== Insertions or deletions ===
One of the first studies of TATA box mutations looked at a sequence of DNA from &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; for the octopine type cytokinin gene. This specific gene has three TATA boxes. A phenotype change was only observed when all three TATA boxes were deleted. An insertion of extra base pairs between the last TATA box and the transcription start site resulted in a shift in the start site; thus, resulting in a phenotypic change.  From this original mutation study, a change in transcription can be seen when there is no TATA box to promote transcription, but transcription of a gene will occur when there is an insertion to the sequence. The nature of the resulting phenotype may be affected due to the insertion.

Mutations in maize promoters affect the expression of the promoter genes in a plant-organ-specific manner. A duplication of the TATA box leads to a significant decrease in enzymatic activity in the scutellum and roots, leaving pollen enzymatic levels unaffected. A deletion of the TATA box leads to a small decrease in enzymatic activity in the scutellum and roots, but a large decrease in enzymatic levels in pollen.

=== Point mutations ===
Point mutations to the TATA box have similar varying phenotypic changes depending on the gene that is being affected. Studies also show that the placement of the mutation in the TATA box sequence hinders the binding of TBP. For example, a mutation from TATAAAA to CATAAAA does completely hinder the binding sufficiently to change transcription, the neighboring sequences can affect if there is a change or not. However, a change can be seen in HeLa cells with a TATAAAA to TATACAA which leads to a 20 fold decrease in transcription. Some diseases that can be caused due to this insufficiency by specific gene transcription are:  Thalassemia, lung cancer, chronic hemolytic anemia, immunosuppression, hemophilia B Leyden, and thrombophlebitis and myocardial infarction.

Savinkova et al. has written a simulation to predict the &quot;KD&quot; value for a selected TATA box sequence and TBP. This can be used to directly predict the phenotypic traits resulting from a selected mutation based on how tightly TBP is binding to the TATA box.

=== Diseases ===
Mutations in the TATA box region affects the binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) for transcription initiation, which may cause carriers to have a disease phenotype.

Gastric cancer is correlated with TATA box polymorphism. The TATA box has a binding site for the transcription factor of the PG2 gene. This gene produces PG2 serum, which is used as a biomarker for tumours in gastric cancer. Longer TATA box sequences correlates with higher levels of PG2 serum indicating gastric cancer conditions. Carriers with shorter TATA box sequences may produce lower levels of PG2 serum.

Several neurodegenerative disorders are associated TATA box mutations. Two disorders have been highlighted, spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington&#x27;s disease. In spinocerebellar ataxia, the disease phenotype is caused by expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in the TATA-binding protein (TBP). An accumulation of these polyglutamine-TBP cells will occur, as shown by protein aggregates in brain sections of patients, resulting in a loss of neuronal cells.

Blindness can be caused by excessive cataract formation when the TATA box is targeted by microRNAs to increase the level of oxidative stress genes. MicroRNAs can target the 3&#x27;-untranslated region and bind to the TATA box to activate the transcription of oxidative stress related genes.

SNPs in TATA boxes are associated with B-thalassemia, immunosuppression, and other neurological disorders. SNPs destabilize the TBP/TATA complex which significantly decreases the rate at which TATA-binding proteins (TBP) will bind to the TATA box. This leads to lower levels of transcription affecting the severity of the disease. Results from studies have shown the interaction in vitro so far, but results may be comparable to that in vivo.

Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome is correlated with UTG1A1 TATA box polymorphism. This poses a risk for developing jaundice in newborns.

MicroRNAs also play a role in replicating viruses such as HIV-1. Novel HIV-1-encoded microRNA have been found to enhance the production of the virus as well as activating HIV-1 latency by targeting the TATA box region.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Technology ===
Many of the studies so far have been performed in vitro, providing only a prediction of what may happen not a real-time representation of what is happening in the cells. Recent studies in 2016 have been done to demonstrate TATA-binding activity in vivo. Core promoter-specific mechanisms for transcription initiation by the canonical TBP/TFIID-dependent basal transcription machinery has recently been documented in vivo showing the activation by SRF-dependent upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the human ACTB gene involved in TATA-binding.

=== Cancer therapy ===
Pharmaceutical companies have been designing cancer therapy drugs to target DNA in traditional methods over the years, and have proven to be successful. However, the toxicity of these drugs have pushed scientists to explore other processes related to DNA that could be targeted instead. In recent years, a collective effort has been made to find cancer-specific molecular targets, such as protein-DNA complexes, which include the TATA binding motif. Compounds that trap the protein-DNA intermediate could result in it being toxic to the cell once they encounter a DNA processing event. Example of drugs that contain such compounds include topotecan, SN-38 (topoisomerase I), doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone (topoisomerase II). Cisplatin is a compound that binds covalently to adjacent guanines in the major groove of DNA, which distorts DNA to allow access of DNA-binding proteins in the minor groove. This will destabilize the interaction between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box. The result is to immobilize the TATA-binding protein (TBP) on DNA in order to down-regulate transcription initiation.

== Genetic engineering ==

=== TATA box modification ===
Evolutionary changes have pushed plants to adapt to the changing environmental conditions. In the history of Earth, the development of Earth&#x27;s aerobic atmosphere resulted in an iron deficiency in plants. Compared to other members of the same species, &quot;Malus baccata&quot; var. &quot;xiaojinensis&quot; has a TATA box inserted in the promoter upstream of the iron-regulated transporter 1 (IRT1) promoter. As a result, the promoter activity levels are enhanced, increasing TFIID activity and subsequently transcription initiation, resulting in a more iron-efficient phenotype. With genetic engineering, a similar modification can be done to other plants, such as the model species of tobacco and &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;.

<doc id="553121" wikidata="Q411391" url="?curid=553121" title="Regulation of gene expression">
<text>Regulation of gene expression, or gene regulation, includes a wide range of mechanisms that are used by cells to increase or decrease the production of specific gene products (protein or RNA). Sophisticated programs of gene expression are widely observed in biology, for example to trigger developmental pathways, respond to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food sources. Virtually any step of gene expression can be modulated, from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the post-translational modification of a protein. Often, one gene regulator controls another, and so on, in a gene regulatory network.

Gene regulation is essential for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to express protein when needed. Although as early as 1951, Barbara McClintock showed interaction between two genetic loci, Activator (&quot;Ac&quot;) and Dissociator (&quot;Ds&quot;), in the color formation of maize seeds, the first discovery of a gene regulation system is widely considered to be the identification in 1961 of the &quot;lac&quot; operon, discovered by François Jacob and Jacques Monod, in which some enzymes involved in lactose metabolism are expressed by &quot;E. coli&quot; only in the presence of lactose and absence of glucose.

In multicellular organisms, gene regulation drives cellular differentiation and morphogenesis in the embryo, leading to the creation of different cell types that possess different gene expression profiles from the same genome sequence. Although this does not explain how gene regulation originated, evolutionary biologists include it as a partial explanation of how evolution works at a molecular level, and it is central to the science of evolutionary developmental biology (&quot;evo-devo&quot;).

== Regulated stages of gene expression ==
Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from signaling to transcription to post-translational modification of a protein. The following is a list of stages where gene expression is regulated, where the most extensively utilized point is transcription initiation, the first stage in transcription:
* Signal transduction
* Chromatin, chromatin remodeling, chromatin domains
* Transcription
* Post-transcriptional modification
* RNA transport
* Translation
* mRNA degradation

== Modification of DNA ==
In eukaryotes, the accessibility of large regions of DNA can depend on its chromatin structure, which can be altered as a result of histone modifications directed by DNA methylation, ncRNA, or DNA-binding protein. Hence these modifications may up or down regulate the expression of a gene. Some of these modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and are referred to as epigenetic regulation.

=== Structural ===

Transcription of DNA is dictated by its structure. In general, the density of its packing is indicative of the frequency of transcription. Octameric protein complexes called histones together with a segment of DNA wound around the eight histone proteins (together referred to as a nucleosome) are responsible for the amount of supercoiling of DNA, and these complexes can be temporarily modified by processes such as phosphorylation or more permanently modified by processes such as methylation. Such modifications are considered to be responsible for more or less permanent changes in gene expression levels.

=== Chemical ===

Methylation of DNA is a common method of gene silencing. DNA is typically methylated by methyltransferase enzymes on cytosine nucleotides in a CpG dinucleotide sequence (also called &quot;CpG islands&quot; when densely clustered). Analysis of the pattern of methylation in a given region of DNA (which can be a promoter) can be achieved through a method called bisulfite mapping. Methylated cytosine residues are unchanged by the treatment, whereas unmethylated ones are changed to uracil. The differences are analyzed by DNA sequencing or by methods developed to quantify SNPs, such as Pyrosequencing (Biotage) or MassArray (Sequenom), measuring the relative amounts of C/T at the CG dinucleotide. Abnormal methylation patterns are thought to be involved in oncogenesis.

Histone acetylation is also an important process in transcription. Histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) such as CREB-binding protein also dissociate the DNA from the histone complex, allowing transcription to proceed. Often, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation work together in gene silencing. The combination of the two seems to be a signal for DNA to be packed more densely, lowering gene expression.

== Regulation of transcription ==

Regulation of transcription thus controls when transcription occurs and how much RNA is created. Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by several mechanisms.
Specificity factors alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a given promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to them (i.e., sigma factors used in prokaryotic transcription).
Repressors bind to the Operator, coding sequences on the DNA strand that are close to or overlapping the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase&#x27;s progress along the strand, thus impeding the expression of the gene. The image to the right demonstrates regulation by a repressor in the lac operon.
General transcription factors position RNA polymerase at the start of a protein-coding sequence and then release the polymerase to transcribe the mRNA.
Activators enhance the interaction between RNA polymerase and a particular promoter, encouraging the expression of the gene. Activators do this by increasing the attraction of RNA polymerase for the promoter, through interactions with subunits of the RNA polymerase or indirectly by changing the structure of the DNA.
Enhancers are sites on the DNA helix that are bound by activators in order to loop the DNA bringing a specific promoter to the initiation complex. Enhancers are much more common in eukaryotes than prokaryotes, where only a few examples exist (to date).
Silencers are regions of DNA sequences that, when bound by particular transcription factors, can silence expression of the gene.

== Regulation by RNA ==
RNA can be an important regulator of gene activity, e.g. by microRNA (miRNA), antisense-RNA, or long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). LncRNAs differ from mRNAs in the sense that they have specified subcellular locations and functions. They were first discovered to be located in the nucleus and chromatin, and the localizations and functions are highly diverse now. Some still reside in chromatin where they interact with proteins. While this lncRNA ultimately affects gene expression in neuronal disorders such as Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer disease, others, such as, PNCTR(pyrimidine-rich non-coding transcriptors), play a role in lung cancer. Given their role in disease, lncRNAs are potential biomarkers and may be useful targets for drugs or gene therapy, although there are no approved drugs that target lncRNAs yet. The number of lncRNAs in the human genome remains poorly defined, but some estimates range from 16,000 to 100,000 lnc genes.

== Epigenetic gene regulation ==

Epigenetics refers to the modification of genes that is not changing the DNA or RNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications are also a key factor in influencing gene expression. They occur on genomic DNA and histones and their chemical modifications regulate gene expression in a more efficient manner. There are several modifications of DNA (usually methylation) and more than 100 modifications of RNA in mammalian cells.” Those modifications result in altered protein binding to DNA and a change in RNA stability and translation efficiency.

== Special cases in human biology and disease ==

===Regulation of transcription in cancer===

In vertebrates, the majority of gene promoters contain a CpG island with numerous CpG sites. When many of a gene&#x27;s promoter CpG sites are methylated the gene becomes silenced. Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer. For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see regulation of transcription in cancer). Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered expression of microRNAs. In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of BRCA1 may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers).

===Regulation of transcription in addiction===

One of the cardinal features of addiction is its persistence. The persistent behavioral changes appear to be due to long-lasting changes, resulting from epigenetic alterations affecting gene expression, within particular regions of the brain. Drugs of abuse cause three types of epigenetic alteration in the brain. These are (1) histone acetylations and histone methylations, (2) DNA methylation at CpG sites, and (3) epigenetic downregulation or upregulation of microRNAs. (See Epigenetics of cocaine addiction for some details.)

Chronic nicotine intake in mice alters brain cell epigenetic control of gene expression through acetylation of histones. This increases expression in the brain of the protein FosB, important in addiction. Cigarette addiction was also studied in about 16,000 humans, including never smokers, current smokers, and those who had quit smoking for up to 30 years. In blood cells, more than 18,000 CpG sites (of the roughly 450,000 analyzed CpG sites in the genome) had frequently altered methylation among current smokers. These CpG sites occurred in over 7,000 genes, or roughly a third of known human genes. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites returned to the level of never-smokers within five years of smoking cessation. However, 2,568 CpGs among 942 genes remained differentially methylated in former versus never smokers. Such remaining epigenetic changes can be viewed as “molecular scars” that may affect gene expression.

In rodent models, drugs of abuse, including cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol and tobacco smoke products, all cause DNA damage in the brain. During repair of DNA damages some individual repair events can alter the methylation of DNA and/or the acetylations or methylations of histones at the sites of damage, and thus can contribute to leaving an epigenetic scar on chromatin.

Such epigenetic scars likely contribute to the persistent epigenetic changes found in addiction.

===Regulation of transcription in learning and memory===

In mammals, methylation of cytosine (see Figure) in DNA is a major regulatory mediator. Methylated cytosines primarily occur in dinucleotide sequences where cytosine is followed by a guanine, a CpG site. The total number of CpG sites in the human genome is approximately 28 million. and generally about 70% of all CpG sites have a methylated cytosine.

In a rat, a painful learning experience, contextual fear conditioning, can result in a life-long fearful memory after a single training event. Cytosine methylation is altered in the promoter regions of about 9.17% of all genes in the hippocampus neuron DNA of a rat that has been subjected to a brief fear conditioning experience. The hippocampus is where new memories are initially stored.

Methylation of CpGs in a promoter region of a gene represses transcription while methylation of CpGs in the body of a gene increases expression. TET enzymes play a central role in demethylation of methylated cytosines. Demethylation of CpGs in a gene promoter by TET enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene.

When contextual fear conditioning is applied to a rat, more than 5,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (of 500 nucleotides each) occur in the rat hippocampus neural genome both one hour and 24 hours after the conditioning in the hippocampus. This causes about 500 genes to be up-regulated (often due to demethylation of CpG sites in a promoter region) and about 1,000 genes to be down-regulated (often due to newly formed 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites in a promoter region). The pattern of induced and repressed genes within neurons appears to provide a molecular basis for forming the first transient memory of this training event in the hippocampus of the rat brain.

== Post-transcriptional regulation ==
After the DNA is transcribed and mRNA is formed, there must be some sort of regulation on how much the mRNA is translated into proteins. Cells do this by modulating the capping, splicing, addition of a Poly(A) Tail, the sequence-specific nuclear export rates, and, in several contexts, sequestration of the RNA transcript. These processes occur in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes. This modulation is a result of a protein or transcript that, in turn, is regulated and may have an affinity for certain sequences.

== Three prime untranslated regions and microRNAs ==
Three prime untranslated regions (3&#x27;-UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Such 3&#x27;-UTRs often contain both binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3&#x27;-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3&#x27;-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.

The 3&#x27;-UTR often contains miRNA response elements (MREs). MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind. These are prevalent motifs within 3&#x27;-UTRs. Among all regulatory motifs within the 3&#x27;-UTRs (e.g. including silencer regions), MREs make up about half of the motifs.

As of 2014, the miRBase web site, an archive of miRNA sequences and annotations, listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species. Of these, 1,881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA loci. miRNAs were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target mRNAs (affecting expression of several hundred genes). Freidman et al. estimate that &gt;45,000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA 3&#x27;-UTRs are conserved above background levels, and &gt;60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs.

Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold).

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer. For instance, in gastrointestinal cancers, a 2015 paper identified nine miRNAs as epigenetically altered and effective in down-regulating DNA repair enzymes.

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and autism spectrum disorders.

== Regulation of translation ==
The translation of mRNA can also be controlled by a number of mechanisms, mostly at the level of initiation. Recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit can indeed be modulated by mRNA secondary structure, antisense RNA binding, or protein binding. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, a large number of RNA binding proteins exist, which often are directed to their target sequence by the secondary structure of the transcript, which may change depending on certain conditions, such as temperature or presence of a ligand (aptamer). Some transcripts act as ribozymes and self-regulate their expression.

== Examples of gene regulation ==
* Enzyme induction is a process in which a molecule (e.g., a drug) induces (i.e., initiates or enhances) the expression of an enzyme.
* The induction of heat shock proteins in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.
* The Lac operon is an interesting example of how gene expression can be regulated.
* Viruses, despite having only a few genes, possess mechanisms to regulate their gene expression, typically into an early and late phase, using collinear systems regulated by anti-terminators (lambda phage) or splicing modulators (HIV).
* Gal4 is a transcriptional activator that controls the expression of GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10 (all of which code for the metabolic of galactose in yeast). The GAL4/UAS system has been used in a variety of organisms across various phyla to study gene expression.

=== Developmental biology ===
A large number of studied regulatory systems come from developmental biology. Examples include:
* The colinearity of the Hox gene cluster with their nested antero-posterior patterning
* Pattern generation of the hand (digits - interdigits): the gradient of sonic hedgehog (secreted inducing factor) from the zone of polarizing activity in the limb, which creates a gradient of active Gli3, which activates Gremlin, which inhibits BMPs also secreted in the limb, results in the formation of an alternating pattern of activity as a result of this reaction–diffusion system.
* Somitogenesis is the creation of segments (somites) from a uniform tissue (Pre-somitic Mesoderm). They are formed sequentially from anterior to posterior. This is achieved in amniotes possibly by means of two opposing gradients, Retinoic acid in the anterior (wavefront) and Wnt and Fgf in the posterior, coupled to an oscillating pattern (segmentation clock) composed of FGF + Notch and Wnt in antiphase.
* Sex determination in the soma of a Drosophila requires the sensing of the ratio of autosomal genes to sex chromosome-encoded genes, which results in the production of sexless splicing factor in females, resulting in the female isoform of doublesex.

== Circuitry ==
=== Up-regulation and down-regulation ===
Up-regulation is a process which occurs within a cell triggered by a signal (originating internal or external to the cell), which results in increased expression of one or more genes and as a result the proteins encoded by those genes. Conversely, down-regulation is a process resulting in decreased gene and corresponding protein expression.
* Up-regulation occurs, for example, when a cell is deficient in some kind of receptor. In this case, more receptor protein is synthesized and transported to the membrane of the cell and, thus, the sensitivity of the cell is brought back to normal, reestablishing homeostasis.
* Down-regulation occurs, for example, when a cell is overstimulated by a neurotransmitter, hormone, or drug for a prolonged period of time, and the expression of the receptor protein is decreased in order to protect the cell (see also tachyphylaxis).

=== Inducible vs. repressible systems ===

Gene Regulation can be summarized by the response of the respective system:
* Inducible systems - An inducible system is off unless there is the presence of some molecule (called an inducer) that allows for gene expression. The molecule is said to &quot;induce expression&quot;. The manner by which this happens is dependent on the control mechanisms as well as differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
* Repressible systems - A repressible system is on except in the presence of some molecule (called a corepressor) that suppresses gene expression. The molecule is said to &quot;repress expression&quot;. The manner by which this happens is dependent on the control mechanisms as well as differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

The GAL4/UAS system is an example of both an inducible and repressible system. Gal4 binds an upstream activation sequence (UAS) to activate the transcription of the GAL1/GAL7/GAL10 cassette. On the other hand, a MIG1 response to the presence of glucose can inhibit GAL4 and therefore stop the expression of the GAL1/GAL7/GAL10 cassette.

=== Theoretical circuits ===
* Repressor/Inducer: an activation of a sensor results in the change of expression of a gene
* negative feedback: the gene product downregulates its own production directly or indirectly, which can result in
** keeping transcript levels constant/proportional to a factor
** inhibition of run-away reactions when coupled with a positive feedback loop
** creating an oscillator by taking advantage in the time delay of transcription and translation, given that the mRNA and protein half-life is shorter
* positive feedback: the gene product upregulates its own production directly or indirectly, which can result in
** signal amplification
** bistable switches when two genes inhibit each other and both have positive feedback
** pattern generation

== Study methods ==

In general, most experiments investigating differential expression used whole cell extracts of RNA, called steady-state levels, to determine which genes changed and by how much. These are, however, not informative of where the regulation has occurred and may mask conflicting regulatory processes (&quot;see post-transcriptional regulation&quot;), but it is still the most commonly analysed (quantitative PCR and DNA microarray).

When studying gene expression, there are several methods to look at the various stages. In eukaryotes these include:
* The local chromatin environment of the region can be determined by ChIP-chip analysis by pulling down RNA Polymerase II, Histone 3 modifications, Trithorax-group protein, Polycomb-group protein, or any other DNA-binding element to which a good antibody is available.
* Epistatic interactions can be investigated by synthetic genetic array analysis
* Due to post-transcriptional regulation, transcription rates and total RNA levels differ significantly. To measure the transcription rates nuclear run-on assays can be done and newer high-throughput methods are being developed, using thiol labelling instead of radioactivity.
* Only 5% of the RNA polymerised in the nucleus exits, and not only introns, abortive products, and non-sense transcripts are degradated. Therefore, the differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic levels can be seen by separating the two fractions by gentle lysis.
* Alternative splicing can be analysed with a splicing array or with a tiling array (&quot;see DNA microarray&quot;).
* All in vivo RNA is complexed as RNPs. The quantity of transcripts bound to specific protein can be also analysed by RIP-Chip. For example, DCP2 will give an indication of sequestered protein; ribosome-bound gives and indication of transcripts active in transcription (although a more dated method, called polysome fractionation, is still popular in some labs)
* Protein levels can be analysed by Mass spectrometry, which can be compared only to quantitative PCR data, as microarray data is relative and not absolute.
* RNA and protein degradation rates are measured by means of transcription inhibitors (actinomycin D or α-Amanitin) or translation inhibitors (Cycloheximide), respectively.

<text>Robert Hardie Bruce Crawford (born 16 February 1955) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who served as Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy from 2011 to 2012, having held the junior ministerial position of Minister for Parliamentary Business from 2007 to 2011. Crawford served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Stirling from 2007 to 2021, having previously represented the Mid Scotland and Fife region 1999–2007.

==Background==
Crawford was born in Perth. Prior to entering politics, he was a human resource manager with the Scottish Office.

==Political career==
===Perth Council===
Crawford served as councillor for Kinross on Perth and Kinross District Council from 1988 to 1996 and on Perth and Kinross Council from 1995 to 2001. Crawford was also Leader of Perth and Kinross Council from 1995 to 1999.

===In opposition in Scottish Parliament===
He was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent Mid Scotland and Fife at the 1999 election. He was re-elected in 2003. He was appointed Chief Whip by John Swinney. He ran Swinney&#x27;s campaign to be re-elected as SNP National Convenor when he was challenged by Dr. Bill Wilson in late 2003. Following the adoption of a new constitution by the SNP in 2004, Crawford was appointed as the SNP&#x27;s Business Convener.

===Government Minister===
At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Crawford gained the Stirling seat from the Labour Party. The SNP&#x27;s combined electoral success put them in minority government, and Crawford was appointed to the junior ministerial position of Minister for Parliamentary Business, a position that he held until the end of the parliamentary session.

Crawford was returned to the Stirling constituency in the 2011 election. On 19 May 2011, Crawford became the Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy, departing from this role on 5 September 2012.

<text>Linda Fabiani (born 14 December 1956) HonFRIAS OSSI FCIH is a Scottish politician who served as a Deputy Presiding Officer in the Scottish Parliament from 2016 to 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the East Kilbride constituency from 2011 until her retirement in 2021. She was previously a regional member of the Scottish Parliament for the Central Scotland region from 1999 until 2011.

==Early life and career==
Fabiani was born in Glasgow to a family with both Scottish and Italian roots. Prior to entering politics, she worked as director of East Kilbride Housing Association.

== Political career ==
At 1999, 2003 and 2007 elections, Fabiani unsuccessfully contested the first past the post constituency of East Kilbride finishing as runner up to Andy Kerr of Scottish Labour, reducing Labour&#x27;s majority from 6,499 in 1999 to 1,972 in 2007. However, being listed at number five in the SNP regional list for Central Scotland in 1999, she gained a seat in the newly-established Scottish Parliament. She told the &quot;Dundee Courier&quot; in January 2021 that she had been surprised to get elected at her first attempt. Following the election of 2003, she served as the SNP&#x27;s Deputy Spokesman on Communities inside the Scottish Parliament and chaired the Parliament&#x27;s European and External Relations Committee.

In 2007, Fabiani was made Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity by Italy in recognition of her work promoting links between Scotland and Italy.

With the SNP taking control of the Scottish Government after the 2007 election, Fabiani was appointed Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture. Half way through the SNP&#x27;s term, she was replaced as minister by Mike Russell.

In 2009, she was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. She is a former Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Housing of Scotland.

In May 2011, in the first SNP gain of the election, Fabiani took the East Kilbride constituency from Andy Kerr. With Kerr widely touted as a potential successor to Labour leader Iain Gray, this was one of the major SNP victories of the election. On 21 June 2011 she became the Convener of the Scotland Bill committee.

After her election, she set up a constituency office in 1/3 Strathmore House in the town centre of East Kilbride.

After being re-elected in the 2016 election, Fabiani was elected as one of the two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament.

In August 2020, Fabiani announced that she would not be seeking re-election in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.

In her final term, Fabiani was chosen as convenor of the Scottish Parliamentary inquiry into the government&#x27;s mishandling of claims made against Alex Salmond.

<text>Robert McKay Gibson (born 10 October 1945) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 2003 until 2016, first as a Highlands and Islands regional member from 2003 until 2011, then representing the Caithness, Sutherland and Ross constituency from 2011 until 2016.

==Early life==
Gibson was born in Glasgow on 10 October 1945. He was educated at the University of Dundee, where he headed the SNP student wing, the Federation of Student Nationalists. He was a district councillor in Ross and Cromarty and worked as a senior secondary school teacher in Alness and Invergordon before taking early retirement in 1995.

==Political career==
Gibson stood as SNP candidate for the Inverness seat in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election. In the early 1980s, he was a member of the SNP 79 Group. He stood as a candidate for Ross, Cromarty and Skye in 1987 and again in 1992.

Gibson was first elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2003 election from the Highlands and Islands regional list, and was re-elected for this region in 2007.

During the fourth Scottish Parliament, he was the Convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee.

In 2012, the Scottish Renewables Green Energy Awards named him their &quot;Politician of the Year&quot;.

In May 2015 he announced that he would not stand for re-election in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.

==Personal life==
His partner is the former Highlands and Islands MSP, Eleanor Scott, of the Scottish Greens; they have two children, a son and a daughter.

Gibson is also a musician and an author, and has written several books about Highland history and emigration. These include &quot;Plaids and Bandanas&quot;, &quot;The Highland Clearances Trail&quot; and &quot;Highland Cowboys&quot;.
