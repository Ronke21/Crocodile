<text>Polycarbonates (PC) are a group of thermoplastic polymers containing carbonate groups in their chemical structures. Polycarbonates used in engineering are strong, tough materials, and some grades are optically transparent. They are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed. Because of these properties, polycarbonates find many applications. Polycarbonates do not have a unique resin identification code (RIC) and are identified as &quot;Other&quot;, 7 on the RIC list. Products made from polycarbonate can contain the precursor monomer bisphenol A (BPA).

==Structure==

Carbonate esters have planar OC(OC)2 cores, which confer rigidity. The unique O=C bond is short (1.173 Å in the depicted example), while the C-O bonds are more ether-like (the bond distances of 1.326 Å for the example depicted). Polycarbonates received their name because they are polymers containing carbonate groups (−O−(C=O)−O−). A balance of useful features, including temperature resistance, impact resistance and optical properties, positions polycarbonates between commodity plastics and engineering plastics.

==Production==
=== Phosgene route ===
The main polycarbonate material is produced by the reaction of bisphenol A (BPA) and phosgene . The overall reaction can be written as follows:

The first step of the synthesis involves treatment of bisphenol A with sodium hydroxide, which deprotonates the hydroxyl groups of the bisphenol A.

:(HOC6H4)2CMe2 + 2 NaOH → Na2(OC6H4)2CMe2 + 2 H2O

The diphenoxide (Na2(OC6H4)2CMe2) reacts with phosgene to give a chloroformate, which subsequently is attacked by another phenoxide. The net reaction from the diphenoxide is:

:Na2(OC6H4)2CMe2 + COCl2 → 1/n [OC(OC6H4)2CMe2]n + 2 NaCl

In this way, approximately one billion kilograms of polycarbonate is produced annually. Many other diols have been tested in place of bisphenol A, e.g. 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane and dihydroxybenzophenone. The cyclohexane is used as a comonomer to suppress crystallisation tendency of the BPA-derived product. Tetrabromobisphenol A is used to enhance fire resistance. Tetramethylcyclobutanediol has been developed as a replacement for BPA.

=== Transesterification route ===
An alternative route to polycarbonates entails transesterification from BPA and diphenyl carbonate:
:(HOC6H4)2CMe2 + (C6H5O)2CO → 1/n [OC(OC6H4)2CMe2]n + 2 C6H5OH

==Properties and processing==
Polycarbonate is a durable material. Although it has high impact-resistance, it has low scratch-resistance. Therefore, a hard coating is applied to polycarbonate eyewear lenses and polycarbonate exterior automotive components. The characteristics of polycarbonate compare to those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, acrylic), but polycarbonate is stronger and will hold up longer to extreme temperature. Thermally processed material is usually totally amorphous, and as a result is highly transparent to visible light, with better light transmission than many kinds of glass.

Polycarbonate has a glass transition temperature of about , so it softens gradually above this point and flows above about . Tools must be held at high temperatures, generally above to make strain-free and stress-free products. Low molecular mass grades are easier to mold than higher grades, but their strength is lower as a result. The toughest grades have the highest molecular mass, but are more difficult to process.

Unlike most thermoplastics, polycarbonate can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can be processed and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as bending on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, heating may not be necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. PMMA/Acrylic, which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature.

Main transformation techniques for polycarbonate resins:
*extrusion into tubes, rods and other profiles including multiwall
*extrusion with cylinders (calenders) into sheets () and films (below ), which can be used directly or manufactured into other shapes using thermoforming or secondary fabrication techniques, such as bending, drilling, or routing. Due to its chemical properties it is not conducive to laser-cutting. 
*injection molding into ready articles

Polycarbonate may become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation above 

==Applications==

===Electronic components===
Polycarbonate is mainly used for electronic applications that capitalize on its collective safety features. A good electrical insulator with heat-resistant and flame-retardant properties, it is used in products associated with power systems and telecommunications hardware. It can serve as a dielectric in high-stability capacitors. Commercial manufacture of polycarbonate capacitors mostly stopped after sole manufacturer Bayer AG stopped making capacitor-grade polycarbonate film at the end of 2000.

===Construction materials===

The second largest consumer of polycarbonates is the construction industry, e.g. for domelights, flat or curved glazing, roofing sheets and sound walls.
Polycarbonates are used to create materials used in buildings that must be durable but light.

===3D printing===
Polycarbonates are used extensively in 3D FDM printing, producing durable strong plastic products with a high melting point. Polycarbonate is relatively difficult for casual hobbyists to print compared to thermoplastics such as Polylactic acid (PLA) or Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) because of the high melting point, difficulty with print bed adhesion, tendency to warp during printing, and tendency to absorb moisture in humid environments. Despite these issues, 3D printing using polycarbonates is common in the professional community.

===Data storage===
A major polycarbonate market is the production of compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. These discs are produced by injection-molding polycarbonate into a mold cavity that has on one side a metal stamper containing a negative image of the disc data, while the other mold side is a mirrored surface. Typical products of sheet/film production include applications in advertisement (signs, displays, poster protection).

===Automotive, aircraft, and security components===
In the automotive industry, injection-molded polycarbonate can produce very smooth surfaces that make it well-suited for sputter deposition or evaporation deposition of aluminium without the need for a base-coat. Decorative bezels and optical reflectors are commonly made of polycarbonate.
Its low weight and high impact resistance have made polycarbonate the dominant material for automotive headlamp lenses. However, automotive headlamps require outer surface coatings because of its low scratch resistance and susceptibility to ultraviolet degradation (yellowing). The use of polycarbonate in automotive applications is limited to low stress applications. Stress from fasteners, plastic welding and molding render polycarbonate susceptible to stress corrosion cracking when it comes in contact with certain accelerants such as salt water and plastisol. It can be laminated to make bullet-proof &quot;glass&quot;, although &quot;bullet-resistant&quot; is more accurate for the thinner windows, such as are used in bullet-resistant windows in automobiles. The thicker barriers of transparent plastic used in teller&#x27;s windows and barriers in banks are also polycarbonate.

So-called &quot;theft-proof&quot; large plastic packaging for smaller items, which cannot be opened by hand, is typically made from polycarbonate.
The cockpit canopy of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor jet fighter is fabricated from high optical quality polycarbonate. It is the largest item of its type.

=== Niche applications ===
Polycarbonate, being a versatile material with attractive processing and physical properties, has attracted myriad smaller applications. The use of injection molded drinking bottles, glasses and food containers is common, but the use of BPA in the manufacture of polycarbonate has stirred concerns (see Potential hazards in food contact applications), leading to development and use of &quot;BPA-free&quot; plastics in various formulations.
Polycarbonate is commonly used in eye protection, as well as in other projectile-resistant viewing and lighting applications that would normally indicate the use of glass, but require much higher impact-resistance. Polycarbonate lenses also protect the eye from UV light. Many kinds of lenses are manufactured from polycarbonate, including automotive headlamp lenses, lighting lenses, sunglass/eyeglass lenses, camera lenses, swimming goggles and SCUBA masks, and safety glasses/goggles/visors including visors in sporting helmets/masks and police riot gear (helmet visors, riot shields, etc.). Windscreens in small motorized vehicles are commonly made of polycarbonate, such as for motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, and small airplanes and helicopters.

The light weight of polycarbonate as opposed to glass has led to development of electronic display screens that replace glass with polycarbonate, for use in mobile and portable devices. Such displays include newer e-ink and some LCD screens, though CRT, plasma screen and other LCD technologies generally still require glass for its higher melting temperature and its ability to be etched in finer detail.

As more and more governments are restricting the use of glass in pubs and clubs due to the increased incidence of glassings, polycarbonate glasses are becoming popular for serving alcohol because of their strength, durability, and glass-like feel.

Other miscellaneous items include durable, lightweight luggage, MP3/digital audio player cases, ocarinas, computer cases, riot shields, instrument panels, tealight candle containers and food blender jars. Many toys and hobby items are made from polycarbonate parts, like fins, gyro mounts, and flybar locks in radio-controlled helicopters, and transparent LEGO (ABS is used for opaque pieces).

Standard polycarbonate resins are not suitable for long term exposure to UV radiation. To overcome this, the primary resin can have UV stabilisers added. These grades are sold as UV stabilized polycarbonate to injection moulding and extrusion companies. Other applications, including polycarbonate sheets, may have the anti-UV layer added as a special coating or a coextrusion for enhanced weathering resistance.

Polycarbonate is also used as a printing substrate for nameplate and other forms of industrial grade under printed products. The polycarbonate provides a barrier to wear, the elements, and fading.

==== Medical applications ====
Many polycarbonate grades are used in medical applications and comply with both ISO 10993-1 and USP Class VI standards (occasionally referred to as PC-ISO). Class VI is the most stringent of the six USP ratings. These grades can be sterilized using steam at 120 °C, gamma radiation, or by the ethylene oxide (EtO) method. Trinseo strictly limits all its plastics with regard to medical applications. Aliphatic polycarbonates have been developed with improved biocompatibility and degradability for nanomedicine applications.

=== Mobile phones ===

Some smartphone manufacturers use polycarbonate. Nokia used polycarbonate in their phones starting with the N9&#x27;s unibody case in 2011. This practice continued with various phones in the Lumia series. Samsung started using polycarbonate with Galaxy S III&#x27;s &quot;hyperglaze&quot;-branded removable battery cover in 2012. This practice continues with various phones in the Galaxy series. Apple started using polycarbonate with the iPhone 5C&#x27;s unibody case in 2013.

Benefits over glass and metal back covers include durability against shattering (advantage over glass), bending and scratching (advantage over metal), shock absorption, low manufacturing costs, and no interference with radio signals and wireless charging (advantage over metal).
Polycarbonate back covers are available in glossy or matte surface textures.

==History==
Polycarbonates were first discovered in 1898 by Alfred Einhorn, a German scientist working at the University of Munich. However, after 30 years&#x27; laboratory research, this class of materials was abandoned without commercialization. Research resumed in 1953, when Hermann Schnell at Bayer in Uerdingen, Germany patented the first linear polycarbonate. The brand name &quot;Makrolon&quot; was registered in 1955.

Also in 1953, and one week after the invention at Bayer, Daniel Fox at General Electric (GE) in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, independently synthesized a branched polycarbonate. Both companies filed for U.S. patents in 1955, and agreed that the company lacking priority would be granted a license to the technology.

Patent priority was resolved in Bayer&#x27;s favor, and Bayer began commercial production under the trade name Makrolon in 1958. GE began production under the name Lexan in 1960, creating the GE Plastics division in 1973.

After 1970, the original brownish polycarbonate tint was improved to &quot;glass-clear&quot;.
==Potential hazards in food contact applications==
The use of polycarbonate containers for the purpose of food storage is controversial. The basis of this controversy is their hydrolysis (degradation by water, often referred to as leaching) occurring at high temperature, releases bisphenol A:
:1/n [OC(OC6H4)2CMe2]n + H2O → (HOC6H4)2CMe2 + CO2

More than 100 studies have explored the bioactivity of bisphenol A derived from polycarbonates. Bisphenol A appeared to be released from polycarbonate animal cages into water at room temperature and it may have been responsible for enlargement of the reproductive organs of female mice. However, the animal cages used in the research were fabricated from industrial grade polycarbonate, rather than FDA food grade polycarbonate.

An analysis of the literature on bisphenol A leachate low-dose effects by vom Saal and Hughes published in August 2005 seems to have found a suggestive correlation between the source of funding and the conclusion drawn. Industry-funded studies tend to find no significant effects whereas government-funded studies tend to find significant effects.
Sodium hypochlorite bleach and other alkali cleaners catalyze the release of the bisphenol A from polycarbonate containers. Polycarbonate is incompatible with ammonia and acetone. Alcohol is a recommended organic solvent for cleaning grease and oils from polycarbonate.
==Environmental impact==

===Disposal===
Studies have shown that at temperatures above 70 °C, and high humidity, polycarbonate will hydrolyze to bisphenol A (BPA). After about 30 days at 85 °C/96% RH, surface crystals are formed which for 70% consisted of BPA. BPA is a compound that is currently on the list of potential environmental hazardous chemicals. It is on the watch list of many countries, such as United States and Germany.

:-(-OC6H4)2C(CH3)2CO-)-n + H2O → (CH3)2C(C6H4OH)2 + CO2

The leaching of BPA from polycarbonate can also occur at environmental temperature and normal pH (in landfills).The amount of leaching increases as the polycarbonate parts get older. A study found that the decomposition of BPA in landfills (under anaerobic conditions) will not occur. It will therefore be persistent in landfills. Eventually, it will find its way into water bodies and contribute to aquatic pollution.

=== Photo-oxidation of polycarbonate ===

In the presence of UV light, oxidation of this polymer yields compounds such as ketones, phenols, o-phenoxybenzoic acid, benzyl alcohol and other unsaturated compounds. This has been suggested through kinetic and spectral studies. The yellow color formed after long exposure to sun can also be related to further oxidation of phenolic end group

:(OC6H4)2C(CH3)2CO)n + O2 , R* → (OC6H4)2C(CH3CH2)CO)n

This product can be further oxidized to form smaller unsaturated compounds. This can proceed via two different pathways, the products formed depends on which mechanism takes place.

Pathway A

:(OC6H4)2C(CH3CH2)CO + O2, H* formula_1 HO(OC6H4)OCO + CH3COCH2(OC6H4)OCO

Pathway B

:(OC6H4)2C(CH3CH2)CO)n + O2, H* formula_1 OCO(OC6H4)CH2OH + OCO(OC6H4)COCH3

=== Photo-aging reaction ===

Photo-aging is another degradation route for polycarbonates. Polycarbonate molecules (such as the aromatic ring) absorb UV radiation. This absorbed energy causes cleavage of covalent bonds which initiates the photo-aging process. The reaction can be propagated via side chain oxidation, ring oxidation or photo-Fries rearrangement. Products formed include phenyl salicylate, dihydroxybenzophenone groups, and hydroxydiphenyl ether groups.

:(C16H14O3)n formula_1 C16H17O3 + C13H10O3

=== Thermal degradation ===

Waste polycarbonate will degrade at high temperatures to form solid, liquid and gaseous pollutants. A study showed that the products were about 40–50 wt.% liquid, 14–16 wt.% gases, while 34–43 wt.% remained as solid residue. Liquid products contained mainly phenol derivatives (~75 wt.%) and bisphenol (~10 wt.%) also present. Polycarbonate, however, can be safely used as a carbon source in the steel-making industry.

Phenol derivatives are environmental pollutants, classified as volatile organic compounds (VOC). Studies show they are likely to facilitate ground level ozone formation and increase photo-chemical smog. In aquatic bodies, they can potentially accumulate in organisms. They are persistent in landfills, do not readily evaporate and would remain in the atmosphere.

===Effect of fungi===
In 2001 a species of fungus in Belize, &quot;Geotrichum candidum&quot;, was found to consume the polycarbonate found in compact discs (CD). This has prospects for bioremediation. However, this effect has not been reproduced.

<doc id="536314" wikidata="Q204036" url="?curid=536314" title="Cinnamaldehyde">
<text>Cinnamaldehyde is an organic compound with the formula or . Occurring naturally as predominantly the &quot;trans&quot; (&quot;E&quot;) isomer, it gives cinnamon its flavor and odor. It is a phenylpropanoid that is naturally synthesized by the shikimate pathway. This pale yellow, viscous liquid occurs in the bark of cinnamon trees and other species of the genus &quot;Cinnamomum&quot;. It is an essential oil. The bark of cinnamon tree contains high concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. 
==Structure and synthesis==
Cinnamaldehyde was isolated from cinnamon essential oil in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugène-Melchior Péligot and synthesized in the laboratory by the Italian chemist Luigi Chiozza in 1854.

The natural product is &quot;trans&quot;-cinnamaldehyde. The molecule consists of a benzene ring attached to an unsaturated aldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde is an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Its color is due to the π → π* transition: increased conjugation in comparison with acrolein shifts this band towards the visible.

===Biosynthesis===

Cinnamaldehyde is biosynthesized from phenylalanine. Deamination of -phenylalanine into cinnamic acid is catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). PAL catalyzes this reaction by a non-oxidative deamination. This deamination relies on the MIO prosthetic group of PAL. PAL gives rise to &quot;trans-&quot;cinnamic acid. In the second step, 4-coumarate–CoA ligase (4CL) converts cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA by an acid–thiol ligation. 4CL uses ATP to catalyze the formation of cinnamoyl-CoA. 4CL effects this reaction in two steps. 4CL forms a hydroxycinnamate–AMP anhydride, followed by a nucleophile attack on the carbonyl of the acyl adenylate. Finally, Cinnamoyl-CoA is reduced by NADPH catalyzed by CCR (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase) to form cinnamaldehyde.

===Preparation===
Several methods of laboratory synthesis exist. The compound can be prepared from related compounds such as cinnamyl alcohol. An early synthesis involved the aldol condensation of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde can also be obtained from the steam distillation of the oil of cinnamon bark.

==Applications==
===As a flavorant===
The most obvious application for cinnamaldehyde is as flavoring in chewing gum, ice cream, candy, e-liquid and beverages; use levels range from 9 to 4,900 parts per million (ppm) (that is, less than 0.5%). It is also used in some perfumes of natural, sweet, or fruity scents. Almond, apricot, butterscotch, and other aromas may partially employ the compound for their pleasant smells. Cinnamaldehyde can be used as a food adulterant; powdered beechnut husk aromatized with cinnamaldehyde can be marketed as powdered cinnamon. Some breakfast cereals contain as much as 187 ppm cinnamaldehyde.

=== As an agrichemical ===
Cinnamaldehyde has been tested as a safe and effective insecticide against mosquito larvae. A concentration of 29 ppm of cinnamaldehyde kills half of &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquito larvae in 24 hours. Trans-cinnamaldehyde works as a potent fumigant and practical repellant for adult mosquitos. It also has antibacterial and antifungal properties.

=== Miscellaneous uses ===
Cinnamaldehyde is a corrosion inhibitor for steel and other alloys. It is believed to form a protective film on the metal surface.

==Derivatives==
Numerous derivatives of cinnamaldehyde are commercially useful. Dihydrocinnamyl alcohol (3-phenylpropanol) occurs naturally but is produced by double hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. It has the fragrances of hyacinth and lilac. Cinnamyl alcohol similarly occurs naturally and has the odor of lilac but can be also produced starting from cinnamaldehyde. Dihydrocinnamaldehyde is produced by the selective hydrogenation of the alkene subunit. α-Amylcinnamaldehyde and α-hexylcinnamaldehyde are important commercial fragrances, but they are not prepared from cinnamaldehyde. Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, if directed to the alkene, gives hydrocinnamaldehyde.

== Toxicology ==
Cinnamaldehyde is used in agriculture because of its low toxicity, but it is a skin irritant. Cinnamaldehyde may cause allergic contact stomatitis in sensitised individuals, however allergy to the compound is believed to be uncommon.

Cinnamaldehyde can contain traces of styrene, which arises during storage or transport. Styrene especially forms in high humidity and high temperatures.
==DNA repair==

Cinnamaldehyde is a dietary antimutagen that effectively inhibits both induced and spontaneous mutations. Experimental evidence indicates that cinnamaldehyde induces a type of DNA damage in the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and in human cells that elicits recombinational DNA repair that then reduces spontaneous mutations. 
In mice, X-ray–induced chromosome aberrations were reduced when cinnamaldehyde was given orally to the mice after X-ray irradiation, perhaps due to cinnamaldehyde-stimulated DNA repair.

<doc id="536317" wikidata="Q339606" url="?curid=536317" title="Modus ponendo tollens">
<text>Modus ponendo tollens (MPT; Latin: &quot;mode that denies by affirming&quot;) is a valid rule of inference for propositional logic. It is closely related to &quot;modus ponens&quot; and &quot;modus tollendo ponens&quot;. 

==Overview==
MPT is usually described as having the form:
#Not both A and B
#A
#Therefore, not B
For example:
# Ann and Bill cannot both win the race.
# Ann won the race.
# Therefore, Bill cannot have won the race.

As E. J. Lemmon describes it: &quot;&quot;Modus ponendo tollens&quot; is the principle that, if the negation of a conjunction holds and also one of its conjuncts, then the negation of its other conjunct holds.&quot;

In logic notation this can be represented as:
# formula_1
# formula_2
# formula_3

Based on the Sheffer Stroke (alternative denial), &quot;|&quot;, the inference can also be formalized in this way:
# formula_4
# formula_2
# formula_3

==Proof==
==Strong form==
&quot;Modus ponendo tollens&quot; can be made stronger by using exclusive disjunction instead of non-conjunction as a premise:
# formula_7
# formula_2
# formula_3

==See also==
* &quot;Modus tollendo ponens&quot;

<text>Picture Frame Seduction (PFS) is a hardcore punk band originally from Haverfordwest, Wales, but later jointly based in Cadiz and Málaga in Spain and London and Bristol in the UK. In their formative years in Wales the band was considered too aggressive in their musical style and attitude to book and were continually ignored by established Welsh venues. The band&#x27;s influences included their peers of the day, Charged GBH and Discharge. With many other bands of the time, such as The Varukers and Chaos UK, they helped develop the hardcore punk scene in the United Kingdom in the early to mid-1980s, recording from 1979 to 1987 on numerous labels.

PFS disbanded in 1987 but reformed in 1999, after being featured on several punk compilation albums in the intervening years.

<text>Sir William Gascoigne (c. 135017 December 1419) was Chief Justice of England during the reign of King Henry IV.

==Life and work==
Gascoigne (alternatively spelled Gascoyne) was a descendant of an ancient Yorkshire family. He was born in Gawthorp to Sir William Gascoigne and Agnes Franke.

He is said to have studied at the University of Cambridge, but his name is not found in any university or college records. According to Arthur Collins, Gascoigne was a law student at the Inner Temple. It appears from the year-books that he practised as an advocate in the reigns of Edward III and Richard II. When Henry of Lancaster was banished by Richard II, Gascoigne was appointed one of his attorneys, and soon after Henry&#x27;s accession to the throne was made chief justice of the court of King&#x27;s Bench. After the suppression of the rising in the north in 1405, Henry eagerly pressed the chief justice to pronounce sentence upon Richard Scrope (Archbishop of York), and the Earl Marshal Thomas Mowbray, who had been implicated in the revolt. This he absolutely refused to do, asserting the right of the prisoners to be tried by their peers. Although both were later executed, Gascoigne had no part in this. This is Collins&#x27;s account; but it has been doubted whether Gascoigne could have displayed such independence of action without prompt punishment or removal from office.

His reputation is that of a great lawyer who in times of doubt and danger asserted the principle that the head of state is subject to law, and that the traditional practice of public officers, or the expressed voice of the nation in parliament, and not the will of the monarch or any part of the legislature, must guide the tribunals of the country.

The popular tale of his committing the Prince of Wales (the future Henry V) to prison must also be regarded as inauthentic, though it is both picturesque and characteristic. It is said that Gascoigne had directed the punishment of one of the prince&#x27;s riotous companions, and the prince, who was present and enraged at the sentence, struck or grossly insulted the judge. Gascoigne immediately committed him to prison, and gave the prince a dressing-down that caused him to acknowledge the justice of the sentence. The King is said to have approved of the act, but it appears that Gascoigne was removed from his post or resigned soon after the accession of Henry V. He died in 1419, and was buried in All Saints&#x27; Church, the parish church of Harewood in Yorkshire. (This even attracted gazetteers in the 19th century, suggesting his tomb amongst places worthy of visit). Some biographies of him have stated that he died in 1412, but this is disproved by Edward Foss in his &quot;Lives of the Judges&quot;. Although it is clear that Gascoigne did not hold office long under Henry V, it is not impossible that the scene in the fifth act of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, (in which Henry V is crowned king, and assures Gascoigne that he shall continue to hold his post), could have some historical basis, and that his resignation shortly thereafter was voluntary.

==Family==
He was born in Gawthorp - in the valley below Harewood House, in an area later flooded to facilitate the landscape at Harewood (not in Gawthorpe in the West Riding of Yorkshire) - to Sir William Gascoigne and Agnes Franke. He married, firstly, in 1369 Elizabeth de Mowbray (1350–1396), daughter of Alexander de Mowbray, son of Roger de Mowbray, 1st Baron Mowbray. He married, secondly, Joan de Pickering, widow of Henry de Greystock.

The issue by his first marriage were:
*Sir William Gascoigne II (1370–1422) m. Joan Wyman.
*Elizabeth Gascoigne, m. John Aske
* Margaret Gascoigne, m. Robert Hansard

Issue by second marriage:
*Sir Christopher Gascoigne (born 1407)
*James Gascoigne (born 1404), ancestor of poet George Gascoigne
*Agnes Gascoigne (c. 1401after 1466), m. Robert Constable.
*Robert Gascoigne (born c. 1410)
*Richard Gascoigne (born c. 1413)

His brother, Nicholas Gascoigne, was ancestor of the Gascoigne baronets. Another brother, Richard (c. 13651423), married Beatrice Ellis, and was possibly the father of Thomas Gascoigne, Chancellor of Oxford University.

==In popular culture==
Gascoigne is portrayed by Sean Harris in &quot;The King (2019 film).&quot;

<doc id="536350" wikidata="Q1559467" url="?curid=536350" title="Jean Leloup">
<text>Jean Leclerc (; born May 14, 1961) is a Québécois singer-songwriter and author from Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada. He is popularly known as Jean Leloup (which he likes to translate to John the Wolf), a stage name he kept using until 2006, when he temporarily changed his name to Jean Leclerc, only to resurrect his wolf character in August 2008. He is known for his colourful personality and unique musical style in the francophone rock community.

==Biography==
Born in Sainte-Foy in 1961 to Québécois parents, Jean Leclerc grew up in Africa, more precisely in Togo and Algeria. The culture and way of life of his host country had an important influence on him and influenced many of his songs. 

He learned to play guitar by listening to the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. He was also influenced by colorful French music icons such as Jacques Dutronc, Jacques Higelin, Serge Gainsbourg and Michel Polnareff.

He returned to Quebec in 1976, and appeared on the music scene in the 1980s. In 1983, he was noticed at the Festival international de la chanson de Granby and participated in the rock opera Starmania in 1986. However, he quickly distanced himself from the latter because of its &quot;clean&quot; character. Opting for the stage name of Jean Leloup (nicknamed John the Wolf by fans and by himself), he appeared on stage in Montreal in the late 1980s. From the beginning of his career, he made waves with his provocative lyrics--in his song &quot;1990&quot;, he compares the high-tech actions of Desert Storm to his sexual activities with his girlfriend.

His 1990 album &quot;L&#x27;amour est sans pitié&quot; was a hit outside of Quebec, and was released in the rest of Canada, USA, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Japan.

He was the recipient of a Félix Award in 1997, following the success of his 1996 album &quot;Le Dôme&quot;.

At the end of 2003, Leclerc retired the name &quot;Jean Leloup&quot; and went on hiatus from his recording career. In August 2005, he announced his temporary return to the music scene with a collaboration with a band called the Porn Flakes. A first single called &quot;Les Corneilles&quot; has been heard on Quebec&#x27;s radio stations.

In the months preceding his return, Leclerc wrote the philosophical novel &#x27; (originally entitled &#x27;) under the pen name Massoud Al-Rachid; it was published on October 5, 2005 at Leméac editions. 

Leclerc released the album &quot;Mexico&quot; in September 2006, his first under the name Jean Leclerc.

Jean Leclerc returned to the stage on August 29, 2008 for the 400th year of Quebec City&#x27;s founding. He revived the name Jean Leloup for the occasion. The show was held at the Colisée Pepsi. Although controversial, Jean Leclerc mentioned that the &quot;last hour of the show was the best of his life&quot;.

Under the name &quot;Jean Leloup&quot;, Leclerc released the album &quot;Mille Excuses Milady&quot; (translated to &quot;a thousand apologies, Milady&quot;) on April 28, 2009, the first since he publicly declared that he wouldn&#x27;t produce another album.

In 2016, his album &quot;À Paradis City&quot; was nominated for the Juno Award for Album of the Year, and won the Juno Award for Francophone Album of the Year. He received another Juno Award nomination for Francophone Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2020, for his 2019 album &quot;L&#x27;Étrange pays&quot;.

<text>The Ford Trimotor (also called the &quot;Tri-Motor&quot;, and nicknamed the &quot;Tin Goose&quot;) is an American three-engined transport aircraft. Production started in 1925 by the companies of Henry Ford and ended on June 7, 1933, after 199 had been made. It was designed for the civil aviation market, but also saw service with military units.

==Design and development==
In the early 1920s, Henry Ford, along with a group of 19 others including his son Edsel, invested in the Stout Metal Airplane Company. Stout, a bold and imaginative salesman, sent a mimeographed form letter to leading manufacturers, blithely asking for $1,000 with the line, &quot;For your one thousand dollars you will get one definite promise: You will never get your money back&quot; to convince them. Stout raised $20,000, including $1,000 each from Edsel and Henry Ford.

In 1925, Ford bought Stout and its aircraft designs. The single-engined Stout monoplane was turned into a trimotor, the Stout 3-AT with three Curtiss-Wright air-cooled radial engines. After a prototype was built and test-flown with poor results, the &quot;4-AT&quot; and &quot;5-AT&quot; emerged.

The Ford Trimotor using all-metal construction was not a revolutionary concept, but it was certainly more advanced than the standard construction techniques of the 1920s. The aircraft resembled the Fokker F.VII Trimotor (except for being all metal which Henry Ford claimed made it &quot;the safest airliner around&quot;). Its fuselage and wings followed a design pioneered by Junkers during World War I with the Junkers J.I and used postwar in a series of airliners starting with the Junkers F.13 low-wing monoplane of 1920 of which a number were exported to the US, the Junkers K 16 high-wing airliner of 1921, and the Junkers G 24 trimotor of 1924. All of these were constructed of aluminum alloy, which was corrugated for added stiffness, although the resulting drag reduced its overall performance. So similar were the designs that Junkers sued and won when Ford attempted to export an aircraft to Europe. In 1930, Ford countersued in Prague, and despite the possibility of anti-German sentiment, was decisively defeated a second time, with the court finding that Ford had infringed upon Junkers&#x27; patents.

Although designed primarily for passenger use, the Trimotor could be easily adapted for hauling cargo, since its seats in the fuselage could be removed. To increase cargo capacity, one unusual feature was the provision of &quot;drop-down&quot; cargo holds below the lower inner wing sections of the 5-AT version.

One 4-AT with Wright J-4 200-hp engines was built for the U.S. Army Air Corps as the C-3, and seven with Wright R-790-3 (235 hp) as C-3As. The latter were upgraded to Wright R-975-1 (J6-9) radials at 300 hp and redesignated C-9. Five 5-ATs were built as C-4s or C-4As.

The original (commercial production) 4-AT had three air-cooled Wright radial engines. It carried a crew of three: a pilot, a copilot, and a stewardess, as well as eight or nine passengers . The later 5-AT had more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. All models had an aluminum corrugated sheet-metal body and wings. Unlike many aircraft of this era, extending through World War II, its control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, and rudders) were not fabric covered, but were also made of corrugated metal. As was common for the time, its rudder and elevators were actuated by metal cables that were strung along the external surface of the aircraft. Engine gauges were also mounted externally, on the engines, to be read by the pilot while looking through the aircraft windshield. Another interesting feature was the use of the hand-operated &quot;Johnny brake.&quot;

Like Ford cars and tractors, these Ford aircraft were well designed, relatively inexpensive, and reliable (for the era). The combination of a metal structure and simple systems led to their reputation for ruggedness. Rudimentary service could be accomplished &quot;in the field&quot; with ground crews able to work on engines using scaffolding and platforms. To fly into otherwise-inaccessible sites, the Ford Trimotor could be fitted with skis or floats.

The rapid development of aircraft at this time (the vastly superior Boeing 247 first flew at start of 1933), along with the death of his personal pilot, Harry J. Brooks, on a test flight, led to Henry Ford&#x27;s losing interest in aviation. While Ford did not make a profit on its aircraft business, Henry Ford&#x27;s reputation lent credibility to the infant aviation and airline industries, and Ford helped introduce many aspects of the modern aviation infrastructure, including paved runways, passenger terminals, hangars, airmail, and radio navigation. 

In the late 1920s, the Ford Aircraft Division was reputedly the &quot;largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes in the world.&quot; Alongside the Ford Trimotor, a new single-seat commuter aircraft, the Ford Flivver or &quot;Sky Flivver&quot; had been designed and flown in prototype form, but never entered series production. The Trimotor was not to be Ford&#x27;s last venture in aircraft production. During World War II, the largest aircraft manufacturing plant in the world was built at the Willow Run, Michigan plant, where Ford produced thousands of B-24 Liberator bombers under license from Consolidated Aircraft.

William Stout left the Metal Airplane division of the Ford Motor Company in 1930. He continued to operate the Stout Engineering Laboratory, producing various aircraft. In 1954, Stout purchased the rights to the Ford Trimotor in an attempt to produce new examples. A new company formed from this effort brought back two modern examples of the trimotor aircraft, renamed the Stout Bushmaster 2000, but even with improvements that had been incorporated, performance was judged inferior to modern designs.

==Operational history==
Production ran from 1926 and 1933 and 199 were built, including 79 4-ATs, and 117 5-ATs, plus some experimental craft. Well over 100 airlines of the world flew the Ford Trimotor. From mid-1927, the type was also flown on executive transportation duties by several commercial nonairline operators, including oil and manufacturing companies.

The impact of the Ford Trimotor on commercial aviation was immediate, as the design represented a &quot;quantum leap over other airliners.&quot; Within a few months of its introduction, Transcontinental Air Transport was created to provide coast-to-coast operation, capitalizing on the Trimotor&#x27;s ability to provide reliable and, for the time, comfortable passenger service. While advertised as a transcontinental service, the airline had to rely on rail connections with a deluxe Pullman train that would be based in New York being the first part of the journey. Passengers then met a Trimotor in Port Columbus, Ohio, that would begin a hop across the continent ending at Waynoka, Oklahoma, where another train would take the passengers to Clovis, New Mexico, where the final journey would begin, again on a Trimotor, to end up at the Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale, a few miles northeast of Los Angeles. This demanding trip would be available for only a year before Transcontinental was merged into a combine with Western Air Service.

Ford Trimotors were also used extensively by Pan American Airways, for its first international scheduled flights from Key West to Havana, Cuba, in 1927. Eventually, Pan American extended service from North America and Cuba into Central and South America in the late 1920s and early 1930s. One of Latin America&#x27;s earliest airlines, Cubana de Aviación, was the first to use the Ford Trimotor in Latin America, starting in 1930, for its domestic services.

The heyday for Ford&#x27;s transport was relatively brief, lasting only until 1933, when more modern airliners began to appear. Rather than completely disappearing, the Trimotors gained an enviable reputation for durability with Ford ads in 1929 proclaiming, &quot;No Ford plane has yet worn out in service.&quot; First being relegated to second- and third-tier airlines, the Trimotors continued to fly into the 1960s, with numerous examples being converted into cargo transports to further lengthen their careers, and when World War II began, the commercial versions were soon modified for military applications.

Some of the significant flights made by the Ford Trimotor in this period greatly enhanced the reputation of the type for strength and reliability. One example was Ford 4-AT Trimotor serial number 10, built in 1927. It flew in the United States and Mexico under registration number C-1077, and for several years in Canada under registration G-CARC. It had many notable accomplishments; it was flown by Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart, among many others. It made the first commercial flight from the United States to Mexico City, as well as the first commercial flight over the Canadian Rockies. After damage on landing in 1936, it was grounded and remained for decades at Carcross, Yukon. In 1956, the wreck was salvaged and preserved, and in the mid-1980s, Greg Herrick took over C-1077 and began restoring it. As of 2006, C-1077 is in flying condition again, restored to its December 1927 appearance.

On November 27 and 28, 1929, Commander Richard E. Byrd (navigator), chief pilot Bernt Balchen, and two other crewmen, the copilot and the photographer, made the first flight above the geographic South Pole in a Ford Trimotor that Byrd named the &quot;Floyd Bennett&quot;. This was one of three aircraft taken on this polar expedition, with the other two being named &quot;The Stars and Stripes&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot;, replacing the Fokker Trimotors that Byrd previously used.

In February 1930, a Ford Trimotor was used for the flight of Elm Farm Ollie, the first cow to fly in an aircraft and to be milked mid-flight.

Franklin Roosevelt flew aboard a Ford Trimotor in 1932 during his presidential campaign in one of the first uses of an aircraft in an election, replacing the traditional &quot;whistle stop&quot; train trips.

A Ford Trimotor was used in a search for the lost flyers of the Sigizmund Levanevsky trans-polar flight in 1937. Movie stunt flyer Jimmie Mattern flew a specially modified Lockheed Electra along with fellow movie flyer, Garland Lincoln, flying a stripped-down Trimotor donated by the president of Superior Oil Company. With 1,800 gallons of avgas and 450 gallons of oil in the modified cabin, the Trimotor was intended to act as a &quot;tanker&quot; for the expedition. The Electra was able to transfer fuel in the air from the Trimotor, through a hose cast out the 4-AT&#x27;s door. With the first aerial refueling test successful, the pair of pilots set out for Fairbanks, landing first at Burwash Landing, Yukon Territory, Canada, on August 15, 1937, but the Trimotor ran out of fuel and crashed in inclement weather the following day. The Trimotor was abandoned on the tundra.

One of the major uses of the Trimotor after it was superseded as a passenger aircraft by more modern aircraft like the Boeing 247 (1933) or the Douglas DC-2 (1934), then DC-3, was the carrying of heavy freight to mining operations in jungles and mountains. The Trimotor was employed for decades in this role.

In 1942, during the Battle of Bataan, a Trimotor was used in evacuations. The aircraft would haul 24 people nearly 500 miles a trip, twice daily. The aircraft was eventually strafed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft.
In postwar years, the Ford Trimotors continued in limited service with small, regional air carriers. Scenic Airways Ford Trimotor N414H was used for 65 years as a sightseeing aircraft flying over the Grand Canyon.

<text>Richard James Biggs II (March 18, 1960 – May 22, 2004) was an American television and stage actor, known for his roles on the television series &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Columbus, Ohio, Biggs graduated from Minot High School (Minot, ND). He attended the University of Southern California on scholarship, studying theatre. He briefly taught at a Los Angeles high school before landing his first major television role, that of Dr. Marcus Hunter on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

Biggs was diagnosed with hearing problems when he was 13, and was partially deaf in one ear, completely deaf in the other. He frequently used his celebrity status to raise money for the Aliso Academy, a private school in Rancho Santa Margarita, California that serves deaf children.

== Career ==
From 1987 until 1994, Biggs played the role of Dr. Marcus Hunter on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

He appeared as Dr. Stephen Franklin on the well-regarded science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1994–1998), reprising the role in the final aired episode of the spin-off show, &quot;Crusade&quot; (&quot;Each Night I Dream of Home&quot;).

After &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, he played roles on &quot;Any Day Now&quot; and &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, as well as the recurring role of Clayton Boudreaux on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

Biggs&#x27; stage credits include &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

At the time of his death, he was a regular on the television series &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;; following his death, his character was killed in an off-screen traffic accident. He also guest starred as a visiting scientist on &quot;&quot;. Biggs&#x27; final film appearance was in &quot;Special Report: Zombie Invasion&quot;, a short film also featuring Biggs&#x27; &quot;Babylon 5&quot; costar, Bruce Boxleitner, released as a companion piece to the 2004 remake of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; on DVD. His final television appearance was as a guest star on a 2004 episode of the Nickelodeon series &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, entitled &quot;The Gary Grill&quot; portraying an FBI agent, which was dedicated to his memory. He only won one award in his career. That award was the Soap Opera Digest Award for Supporting Actor.

== Personal life ==
He grew up on Air Force bases across the US because his father Colonel Richard was in the Air Force.

He married Lori Kay Gebers Biggs on August 1, 1998. They have two sons Richard James III and Hunter Lee.

== Death ==
Biggs collapsed at his home in Los Angeles, and died at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center of complications stemming from aortic dissection on May 22, 2004. He was 44 years old.

<text>Dublin County Council () was a local authority for the administrative county of County Dublin in Ireland.

==History==
The county council was established on 1 April 1899 under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 for the administrative county of County Dublin. Its headquarters were established at 10–11 Parnell Square in 1900 but, due to the cramped conditions, it transferred to 46–49 O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin City in 1975.

In 1985, County Dublin was divided into three electoral counties: Dublin–Belgard (South Dublin from 1991) to the southwest, Dublin–Fingal (Fingal from 1991) to the north, and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown to the southeast. At the 1985 local election and the 1991 local election, the election was held within these electoral counties.

On 1 January 1994, under the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993, County Dublin, the County Council and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire were abolished, and the electoral counties each became administrative counties. Dublin County Council was succeeded by the councils of:
* Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council
* Fingal County Council
* South Dublin County Council

The city of Dublin has been administered separately from the county since before the establishment of the county council. Its local authority is Dublin City Council, styled Dublin Corporation until 2002.

The archives of Dublin County Council are held at Fingal Local Studies &amp; Archives.

==Legacy==
Both the Parnell Square property and the O&#x27;Connell Street property were transferred to the Fingal County Council on the abolition of Dublin County Council. These offices were a key location in the events described in the Mahon Tribunal – a tribunal which inquired into re-zoning and planning irregularities in the 1980s in County Dublin.

From 1994 to 2014, the Dublin Regional Authority served as a coordinating body for the area which had been administered by Dublin County Council, as well as that of Dublin City Council. The area is now part of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly.

==Motto==
The motto on its coat of arms was in Irish which means &quot;Action to match our speech&quot;.

<doc id="536372" wikidata="Q7993632" url="?curid=536372" title="While You Were Out (TV series)">
<text>While You Were Out is an American reality series that aired episodes on the cable channel TLC. The format of the show is similar to TLC&#x27;s &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; (which, in turn, is based on the BBC TV series &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;). &quot;While You Were Out&quot; adds a suspenseful gimmick by keeping the entire redecoration a secret from the homeowner.

The series was revived in 2019, as a collaboration between TLC and new sister network HGTV.

==Premise of show==
The series began with the following premise: An individual sets up a friend or family member with a surprise room redecoration. A typical example of an episode would be a wife who wants to surprise her husband by having the living room redone. The person being set up is sent out of the house for two days on a phony premise, such as a vacation.

While the person is out, the friend or family member with the help of a designer redecorates one room in the house, though gardens have also been made over. The initial budget for the makeover was U.S. $1000, later raised to $1500, and then $2000.

The designers must work with the homeowner to come up with a design, shop for supplies and redecorate the selected area within a 32-hour time frame, though during the beginning of the show&#x27;s run, the designers designed a room, and it was a surprise to the helping homeowner/friend when the host and designer showed up on the first day. While the redecoration is in progress, a &quot;secret shooter&quot; trails the person who has been sent out of the house and tapes an interview with the unsuspecting person. The footage is then used for the purpose of quizzing the spouse, friend or relative at home. If the person who sets up the individual answers the questions correctly, they will win a prize that further enhances the room&#x27;s décor.

At the end of the show, the person being surprised returns home to the redecoration, and their reaction is recorded. The surprised person is then quizzed for the opportunity to win a further prize.

One of the aspects that made both &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; and &quot;While You Were Out&quot; stand apart from previous home renovation shows was that they openly depicted conflict between the cast, crew and homeowners. These conflicts were usually fairly friendly, but sometimes devolved into rather bitter arguments. &quot;While You Were Out&quot;, in particular, revealed many personality quirks of both the cast and guests.

On some occasions, the individual to be surprised disliked the redesign of the home. Teresa Strasser&#x27;s final episode has become infamous for just this reason. The homeowner returned to find that his deck had a large hole in it, and subsequently launched into a lengthy tirade while his wife wept.

The premise of the show evolved somewhat as the series progressed (see below for details).

==History==
During season 1 there were four quizzes. The individual who was arranging the surprise (referred to as the &quot;homeowner&quot;) for their loved one had to answer three of the quizzes. For each quiz there was a &quot;booby prize&quot; in case the homeowner failed the quiz. Normally the &quot;booby prize&quot; was a fun, toy version of the real thing (for example, a globe pencil sharpener instead of a real globe). The show was first hosted by Anna Bocci, who swiftly departed and was replaced by actress and writer Teresa Strasser, who remained for the rest of the first season. Strasser never considered herself terribly handy but compensated with her empathy for the homeowners—their travails drove her to tears on several occasions—and a sometimes dark sense of humor. During the Strasser era, the humorously &quot;sneaky&quot; aspect of the show was stressed, and many episodes began with Strasser and the designer hiding in a van or a neighbor&#x27;s house early in the morning and observing the departure of the unsuspecting makeover subject.

At the beginning of season 2, Evan Farmer came aboard as host. An actor, singer and former boyband member, Farmer was much more high-energy than Strasser and was a skilled carpenter in his own right. While Strasser&#x27;s humor had been verbal, Farmer tended more toward physical comedy. Farmer also enjoyed a teasing relationship with the show&#x27;s designers and carpenters: where Strasser tended to lead with a nervous, mother-hen approach, Farmer was likely to chide the crew for wasting time or for their personal quirks such as Jason Cameron&#x27;s sideline as a bodybuilder. New music and some new graphics were introduced, the quizzes were reduced to three, and booby prizes were eliminated. The homeowner only had to answer two quizzes, and the unsuspecting person would answer the third quiz. The third quiz question was always the same: Why did the homeowner want to do the room makeover for their loved one? Only once did an unsuspecting person get the answer wrong and lose the prize.

Both Strasser and Farmer had considerable difficulty letting guests lose prizes; on more than one occasion, they would offer &quot;hints&quot; so obvious that they essentially gave the prize away.

In the beginning of season 3, the budget was raised to $2,000 and quizzes kept the same. Toward the end of season 3, the quizzes and secret shooter were eliminated entirely. The homeowners also became more involved in the designing of the room.

Originally during the first season, once the rooms were finished, the carpenters drove away with the show&#x27;s work truck, leaving only Strasser and the designer to greet the subjects and get their reactions. During one episode, however, the build ran so long that the carpenters were not able to leave (although the truck was hidden to avoid ruining the surprise), and they participated in the final reveal. Since then, the format changed so that once everything was finished, the truck was driven away and the carpenters were present at the reveals, allowing them to see the reactions and accept the subjects&#x27; thanks themselves.

Season 4 was the show&#x27;s final season, with the concluding episode airing on August 5, 2006. The final episode was beset with problems, including illnesses on set and Farmer&#x27;s flight not arriving until the final day of the shoot. The episode ended without an obvious acknowledgment that it was the series finale, although Farmer did passingly refer to the final scene as &quot;the end of the era&quot; and designer John Bruce addressed the camera in close up to say, &quot;Thank You, &quot;While You Were Out&quot;.&quot;

Due to the success of the show in Latin America, &quot;Mientras No Estabas&quot; was created for the Discovery En Español channel. The show&#x27;s name is a literal translation of &quot;While You Were Out&quot; and is hosted by Arturo.

In October 2018, building upon its successful revival of sister series &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;, as well as Discovery&#x27;s recent acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive, it was announced that TLC and HGTV had jointly ordered a revived, fifth season of &quot;While You Were Out&quot;. The new season, which premiered March 16, 2019, featured teams representing personalities associated with TLC, and personalities associated with HGTV and DIY Network. New episodes aired simultaneously on both channels, with TLC airing a cut of the episode focusing on the participants and their personal lives (as with the original series), and HGTV airing a cut of the episode that featured a larger focus on the renovation process.

==Other variations==
Over the series, the producers have created different formats of the show including:

*Bringing in designers or carpenters from &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; (and vice versa—the carpenters from &quot;While You Were Out&quot; have made several appearances on &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;)
*Having &quot;on the fly&quot; designs in which the designer does not see the room until the day before the makeover begins, although the carpenters and host are sometimes allowed to see it early. Late in the series run, they started filming the carpenters and designers shopping for supplies on what is called day 0 (the day before general taping).
*Remaking a room with a celebrity guest. These guests have included Penn Jillette (for his partner, Teller), Shannon Elizabeth (for her then-husband), Miss Alabama 2003 Catherine Crosby (for her then-boyfriend), and football player LaVar Arrington, for his brother.
* In 2004, the series aired a crossover with another TLC series, &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, billed as &quot;Double Crossed&quot;, in which the surprisee secretly received a makeover from the show while the home was being worked on.
*&quot;Royal Renovation&quot;: An entire home was redecorated; the episode featured 3 designers: Nadia Gellar, John Bruce and Chayse Dacoda, celebrity guest Stacy &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson and a budget of $10,000.
* For one episode shot near Atlantic City NJ. the home owner allowed Farmer, designer Chase Dacoda and the day&#x27;s carpenters to gamble with $500 of the budget money the day before investing any winnings into the makeover, the crew raised another $300 making the budget for that makeover $1,800.
* Some members of the on camera cast have swapped their typical roles, Farmer himself served as designer in one episode (designer John Bruce served as host in the interim), carpenter/seamstress Leslie Segrete and carpenter Andrew Dan-Jumbo have also taken turns as designer on different episodes (designer Mark Montano filled in as seamstress for Leslie, while designer John Bruce filled in as carpenter for Dan-Jumbo).

<text>Marine reptiles are reptiles which have become secondarily adapted for an aquatic or semiaquatic life in a marine environment. Only about 100 of the 12,000 extant reptile species and subspecies are classed as marine reptiles, including marine iguanas, sea snakes, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles.

The earliest marine reptile was &quot;Mesosaurus&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;), which arose in the Permian period of the Paleozoic era. During the Mesozoic era, many groups of reptiles became adapted to life in the seas, including such familiar clades as the ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs (these two orders were once thought united in the group &quot;Enaliosauria&quot;, a classification now cladistically obsolete), mosasaurs, nothosaurs, placodonts, sea turtles, thalattosaurs and thalattosuchians. Most marine reptile groups became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, but some still existed during the Cenozoic, most importantly the sea turtles. Other Cenozoic marine reptiles included the bothremydids, palaeophiid snakes, a few choristoderes such as &quot;Simoedosaurus&quot; and dyrosaurid crocodylomorphs. Various types of marine gavialid crocodilians remained widespread as recently as the Late Miocene.

Some marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, metriorhynchid thalattosuchians, and mosasaurs became so well adapted to a marine lifestyle that they were incapable of venturing onto land and gave birth in the water. Others, such as sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles, return to shore to lay their eggs. Some marine reptiles also occasionally rest and on land.

== Extant groups ==
* Sea turtles: there are seven extant species of sea turtles, which live mostly along the tropical and subtropical coastlines, though some do migrate long distances and have been known to travel as far north as Scandinavia. Sea turtles are largely solitary animals, though some do form large, though often loosely connected groups during nesting season. Although only seven turtle species are truly marine, many more dwell in brackish waters.
* Sea snakes: the most abundant of the marine reptiles, there are over 60 different species of sea snakes. They inhabit the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans, though very limited reports of sightings suggest they may be extending into the Atlantic Ocean. Sea snakes are venomous and their bites have been known to be fatal, though generally they only bite when provoked and often inject only a very small, non-fatal quantity of venom. Sea snakes are distinguished from terrestrial snakes by a vertically flattened tail.
* Marine iguana: marine iguanas live only on the Galápagos Islands and are not fully adapted to marine life. Although they feed exclusively on marine plants and spend a good deal of their time in the water, they do nest on land and need to bask in the sun to reach their ideal body temperature; they are thus also subject to terrestrial predators.
* Saltwater and American crocodiles: none of the extant species of crocodiles are truly marine; however, the saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) does display adaptations to saltwater inhabitation and dwells in the brackish waters of Southeast Asia and Australia. Saltwater crocodiles dispose of excess salt in their bodies through specialized salt glands. These are the largest species of crocodile, also making them the largest reptiles. They can grow up to six meters in length. American crocodiles (&quot;Crocodylus acutus&quot;) similarly prefer brackish over freshwater habitats.

==Extinct groups==

*Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles with a dolphin-like body shape that flourished during the Mesozoic era.
*Sauropterygians were a diverse group of aquatic reptiles adapted for flipper-based aquatic locomotion. This group included the plesiosaurs, nothosaurs, and placodonts.
*Mosasaurs were a group of large, aquatic squamates (relatives of modern-day lizards and snakes) which became the dominant marine predators towards the end of the Cretaceous period.
*Thalattosaurs were a group of aquatic or semiaquatic marine reptiles of uncertain placement within the diapsid clade. One subgroup, the thalattosauroids, are known for their unusual downturned snouts and crushing dentition.
*Mesosaurs were quite possibly the first fully aquatic reptilian animals and the only group known from the Paleozoic, though they are technically not true reptiles in the sense of not being part of the diapsid group. Taxonomic placement either puts these Permian animals resembling long-snouted lizards with newt-like tails either as members of Parareptilia or as a type of Synapsid.
*Thalattosuchians were marine crocodylomorphs that flourished during the Jurassic period.

==Adaptation to the marine environment==

== Conservation ==
Most species of marine reptiles are considered endangered to some degree. All but one species of sea turtles are endangered due to destruction of nesting habitats on coastal lands, exploitation, and marine fishing; many species of sea snakes are threatened or endangered due to commercial exploitation (sale of skins) and pollution especially in Asia; marine iguanas are threatened due to their very limited habitation range. Saltwater crocodiles are at low risk for extinction.

<text>James Conrad Verraros (born February 8, 1983) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor, who placed ninth on the first season of &quot;American Idol.&quot; Raised by deaf parents, he is fluent in American Sign Language and gained notoriety on &quot;American Idol&quot; for signing the lyrics to his audition song. After competing on the series, he released three pop rock, dance albums with music producer and songwriter Gabe Lopez. Verraros was also featured on the 2002 compilation album &quot;American Idol: Greatest Moments&quot;, covering &quot;Easy&quot; by the Commodores – this album reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

While participating in the 2002 American Idols LIVE! tour, Verraros came out as gay. He was the first &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist to come out, and he remained the series&#x27; only publicly gay finalist for over three years. Several organizations subsequently honored Verraros as an influential figure within the gay community (such as &quot;Out&quot; magazine, which named him to its &quot;Most Intriguing People&quot; list twice, first in 2002 and again in 2006). Throughout his music career, Verraros performed at numerous pride events. He also toured at gay clubs.

Verraros released his official debut album, &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, through independent label Koch Records in 2005. It was accompanied by two singles and received generally positive reviews. Some of the songs from &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; had previously been featured on a demo album, &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot;, which Verraros had self-released through mp3.com around 2003. The lead single from &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, &quot;You Turn It On&quot;, peaked at number twenty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Play Chart.

In addition to music, Verraros pursued an acting career. He had a starring role in the first two installments of the gay comedy film franchise &quot;Eating Out&quot;, and he had a cameo in &quot;Another Gay Movie&quot;. He also stayed involved with &quot;American Idol&quot;-related projects for several years. In 2003, he joined with various finalists from the first two seasons of the series for a promotional tour of select shopping malls throughout the United States, and later, he co-hosted a video recap series of &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s seventh season for AfterElton.com.

In 2007, Verraros released a non-album single about his then-to-be husband, Bill Brennan; the song, &quot;You Make It Better&quot;, was featured in the second &quot;Eating Out&quot; film. Verraros and Brennan married in 2009. The same year as his wedding, Verraros self-released three new singles, although the accompanying second album, &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot;, was not released until 2011. Following &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot;, Verraros announced his intention to retire from music. He subsequently served as executive vice president of Brennan&#x27;s organization, Bridal Expo Chicago and Bridal Expo Milwaukee. Verraros and Brennan have since separated.

== Early life ==
Verraros was born on February 8, 1983, in Mount Prospect, Illinois. He grew up in nearby Crystal Lake. His father, Nicholas, and mother, Debbie, both lost their hearing after contracting German measles as infants. Verraros was raised to be fluent in American Sign Language. The responsibility of interpreting for his parents as a child led him to relate with people older than himself, more than he did with others his own age. Reflecting on his childhood, Verraros once said, &quot;I had to do things like hold phone conversations and discuss things with doctors and even real estate agents. I had to become well-versed not only with sign language but with people skills as well...I didn&#x27;t have time for bullshit.&quot;

Around the age of twelve or thirteen, Verraros realized that he is gay. Although he did not come out publicly until after adolescence, his sexual orientation was apparent to his classmates, who bullied him during middle school. In response, Verraros developed a more masculine appearance. In a 2003 interview, he said of the time, &quot;I changed my image. I wore a lot of baggy jeans, I gained weight, and it was fine for a while.&quot; He also sought help from the school psychologist during those years. High school marked a more significant improvement for him – he became active in theater and went on to attend Monmouth College on a theater scholarship.

Upon later transferring to Columbia College, Verraros struggled to find acting opportunities. Insecure about the weight that he had put on, he began doing intensive workouts and became a vegetarian. Over the course of two and a half months, he lost around eighty pounds. Some people thought that he had developed an eating disorder, and Verraros later acknowledged that he most likely did.

Verraros was open about his sexual orientation with classmates at both colleges. Looking back in 2004, he said that people who had been mean to him in high school were &quot;rooting&quot; for him at Monmouth and that he came out to his mother and sister during this time. In another interview, he called the environment at Columbia &quot;beyond gay-friendly&quot;.

== &quot;American Idol&quot; ==
During his time at Columbia College, Verraros followed a friend&#x27;s suggestion to try out for &quot;American Idol&quot; and attended the auditions in Chicago – even though his primary interest was acting. Verraros later said that he had only tried out &quot;for fun&quot; and without any expectations. In 2006, he reminisced, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really looking for a record deal. I was looking for the experience, and everything just kind of... happened.&quot; The auditions were held only a few blocks away from his college dorm.

Attempting to stand out, Verraros chose to sing &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; by Nat King Cole at his audition, rather than a pop song. He was nineteen at the time. While singing, he also signed the lyrics to his song. &quot;American Idol&quot; heavily focused on his parents&#x27; disabilities, and several publications speculated that Verraros may have been helped in the competition by sympathy votes.

Despite receiving positive remarks from the judges at his audition, Verraros began receiving largely negative feedback by the Top 30 semi-finals. Placed into Group 1 for that round he chose to reprise &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;. Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul both called this the best performance that Verraros had given on the series up to that point, but Cowell also called Verraros &quot;ordinary&quot; in comparison to that night&#x27;s preceding performer, Tamyra Gray, and declared, &quot;I think if you win this competition, we would have failed.&quot; Jessica Shaw of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called this the harshest critique that Cowell had given to any contestant on the series up to that point. First season co-host Brian Dunkleman recalled in a 2014 podcast overhearing the judges say that they were going to &quot;nail Jim&quot; on the night of the semi-finals. After the performance, Dunkleman offered Verraros reassurance, but during a commercial break, the series&#x27; executive producer, Nigel Lythgoe, purportedly took Dunkleman backstage and raged against him for not further demoralizing Verraros. Dunkleman recounted this as a partial explanation for why he quit the series after its first season.

Phil Rosenthal of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; speculated that the severity of Cowell&#x27;s comments during the semi-finals may have increased audience support for Verraros, who was voted through to the top ten. Originally, Verraros was going to be cut anyway. In his 2011 tell-all book, &quot;American Idol: The Untold Story&quot;, Richard Rushfield revealed that a &quot;judge&#x27;s cut&quot; was going to be introduced as a twist to the semi-finals. After the Group 1 results episode went off air, Cowell went to the three contestants who had been voted through to the finals and told Verraros that the judges were overruling his advancement to the next round. Rushfield wrote that &quot;A stunned Verraros and his fellow contestants burst into tears&quot; upon hearing the announcement. Before the twist could be aired, Lythgoe reversed the decision, arguing that the audience&#x27;s preference should be respected. In 2020, Lythgoe and Verraros spoke together on a podcast and shared their own memories of the &quot;judge&#x27;s cut&quot;, clarifying that it actually occurred on the performance night rather than the results night.

His place in the top ten secure, Verraros planned to sing &quot;Get Ready&quot; by The Temptations for the first round of finals. The week&#x27;s theme was Motown. Verraros won a coin toss against Kelly Clarkson, who also wanted to sing &quot;Get Ready&quot;, but he switched course upon considering how much of the song is in falsetto. With a limited selection of Motown songs available for him to choose from, Verraros settled on &quot;Easy&quot; by The Commodores, even though he was unfamiliar with it. The judges were critical of the performance. Two contestants were voted off that week, and Verraros was the second eliminated, following EJay Day.

=== Public response ===
When Verraros advanced into the top ten for &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s first season, Shaw (of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;) wrote of the contestant, &quot;I can&#x27;t decide whether I love him or loathe him.&quot; She likened Verraros to a forgettable boy-band member, but also wrote that she had appreciated Verraros&#x27; decision to use sign language during his audition. After Verraros was voted off the series, Shaw wrote of him, &quot;I genuinely felt bad for the guy...Of course, I could have told you all that he wasn&#x27;t advancing on to the next round. You can&#x27;t follow up stellar singers like Tamyra and Justin [Guarini] with a tepid rendition of &#x27;Easy.&#x27;&quot; Jim Derogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was more favorable. After watching all of the top ten finalists perform on their nationwide tour, he suggested that Verraros should have placed seventh and commended him for &quot;doing as well as anyone could&quot; with poor singing-material (referring to &quot;Easy&quot;). Another positive review of Verraros came from Rick Shefchik of the &quot;Saint Paul Pioneer Press&quot;, who wrote that Verraros sang a &quot;tender version&quot; of &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; during the competition. Most critics, however, voiced negative opinions. Amy Amatangelo of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; wrote that Verraros &quot;lacked stage presence&quot; and Eric Deggans of &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; called Verraros &quot;obviously overmatched&quot; among the other first season finalists. In his review of &quot;American Idol: Greatest Moments&quot;, Chuck Campbell of &quot;The Herald News&quot; was critical of Verraros&#x27; track on the album, writing &quot;Verraros takes it too easy on his slack interpretation of Lionel Richie&#x27;s Easy.&quot;

==Post-&quot;Idol&quot; life and career==
===2002–2003: &quot;American Idol&quot; tour and related projects===
About a month after being voted out of the top ten on &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s first season, Verraros joined thirteen other former contestants from the series to perform at various events in Northwest Indiana. He participated in a group medley during &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s first season finale and a few weeks later, he reunited with all of the series&#x27; top thirty contestants for the &quot;American Idol in Las Vegas&quot; TV special. Verraros then participated through October and November in the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2002, along with his fellow top ten finalists. For each stop of the tour, he reprised his performance of &quot;Easy&quot; from the series.

Prior to competing on &quot;American Idol&quot;, Verraros had been open about his sexual orientation through an online journal. &quot;The Advocate&quot;, an American LGBT-interest magazine, discovered this journal while Verraros was on the series and contacted Fox with an interview request for the contestant. One day later, the journal was deleted. Verraros later explained to &quot;The Advocate&quot; that his journal had been removed because Fox did not want it to give him an unfair advantage in the competition. Verraros was open about his sexuality with the other &quot;American Idol&quot; finalists, whom he described as being very supportive.

Verraros came out publicly during the &quot;American Idol&quot; tour. He also came out to his father at this time. In November 2002, Verraros was named as one of &quot;2002&#x27;s Most Intriguing People&quot; by &quot;Out&quot;, another LGBT-interest magazine. Around that time, Verraros said, &quot;I just thought it was time to come out. I really hate the segregation and only being able to hold hands in gay bars. We have to start breaking down the barriers. I want to be a gay advocate and let teens know that being gay is just a small part of who you are. And if people don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s their problem, not yours.&quot; Verraros gave an extensive interview to &quot;The Advocate&quot; in January 2003, which was described as his official &quot;coming out&quot;, and in May, he participated in Boston&#x27;s Youth Pride march.

The &quot;American Idol: Greatest Moments&quot; album, released October 1, 2002, features a recorded version of Verraros singing &quot;Easy&quot;. The album reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Asked during his run on &quot;American Idol&quot; what he might call his debut album, Verraros suggested &quot;So You Say&quot;. Verraros moved to Los Angeles after the &quot;American Idol&quot; tour and was turned down by several agencies. While in LA, he lived for two years with Natalie Burge and Christopher Aaron, both of whom were in the Top 30 with him on &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s first season. Throughout the Spring of 2003, Verraros participated in Coca-Cola&#x27;s Behind the Scenes With American Idol promotional tour, in which he and a selection of other finalists from the first two seasons of the series performed across the country in shopping malls owned by the Simon Property Group.

===2003–2005: &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot;, &quot;Eating Out&quot;, and &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;===
Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter and music producer Gabe Lopez reached out to Verraros, after hearing &quot;American Idol: Greatest Moments&quot;. The two began a collaboration based out of Lopez&#x27;s home studio. Unsigned to a record label, Verraros self-released his debut album, &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot;, in 2003. While recording the album, he worked at a tanning salon and at a phone bank. &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot; was included on a list of six indie albums by gay and lesbian artists recommended by Adam B. Vary of &quot;The Advocate&quot;. Vary wrote that Verraros &quot;sings with true passion and bracing maturity&quot; on the album and singled out the track &quot;So Deep&quot;, for being &quot;so dirty even Xtina would blush.&quot; Another track on the album, &quot;I Want You&quot;, was included on &quot;Bi the People&quot;, a 2003 compilation album of &quot;bisexual artists and friends&quot;, which was released to raise money for the Bisexual Foundation. Multiple tracks from &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot; topped the Rock and Pop charts on mp3.com, and the album won the 2004 Out Music Award for Outstanding New Recording – Debut Male. A tour of gay clubs was undertaken to promote the album.

Around the same time that Verraros was recording &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot;, Q. Allan Brocka, an &quot;American Idol&quot; fan, cast Verraros as Kyle in his 2004 gay-themed comedy &quot;Eating Out&quot;. The film was produced on a budget of less than $1 million by Ariztical Entertainment. Filming lasted ten days. Although intended as a straight-to-DVD release, it secured limited theatrical distribution in 2005, after performing well in film festivals. Two songs from &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot;, &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Hollywood&quot;, are included in &quot;Eating Out&quot;, as is a third song performed by Verraros, called &quot;Visions of You&quot;. Writing again for &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Vary (along with Dennis Hensley) placed &quot;Eating Out&quot; among a group of films released in the mid-2000s that he and Hensley felt constituted a &quot;New New Queer Cinema&quot;, after the initial &quot;New Queer Cinema&quot; movement faded in the 1990s. Vary also argued that, as a college sex comedy, &quot;Eating Out&quot; is notable for being an early example of a gay genre film. &quot;Eating Out&quot; received mostly negative reviews, although Verraros was praised for his performance by Dana Stevens in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who wrote that Verraros &quot;has a scrappy energy that sets him apart from the bland and vulgar proceedings&quot; of the film.

====&quot;Rollercoaster&quot;====

According to ChicagoPride.com, Verraros pitched &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot; to &quot;every major label in the U.S. two or three times&quot; without success. Verraros then pursued a record deal in the United Kingdom, hoping that British labels would be more willing to work with an openly gay artist, although nothing materialized from this. New York-based indie label Koch Records began communicating with Verraros over the summer of 2004 about the possibility of featuring him on a compilation album of songs by &quot;American Idol&quot; finalists. Verraros sent Koch Records a demo tape and was signed to the label within a week. &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot; was then revamped and released through Koch Records as &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; on April 26, 2005. This was marketed as Verraros&#x27; official debut. The album recycles several songs from &quot;Unsaid and Understood&quot;, in addition to featuring new material.

Several publications noted that Verraros went through a significant image change between his time on &quot;American Idol&quot; and the release of &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;. Verraros explained that he had &quot;come into [himself]&quot; during that time, having improved his figure and become more involved within the LGBT community. &quot;The Advocate&quot; wrote that on &quot;American Idol&quot;, Verraros had been &quot;a slightly geeky kid with a stiff stance...[and] a preppy look [that] included dark- rimmed glasses, spiky hair and a stone-washed jeans jacket&quot; – in contrast, &quot;The Advocate&quot; wrote, Verraros possessed &quot;bad-boy good looks&quot; and &quot;long rock-star hair&quot; when &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; was released. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; added that the &quot;shaggy dark cut, eye makeup and slick threads&quot; that Verraros had adopted at the time gave him sex appeal. Verraros himself assessed his look on &quot;American Idol&quot; as having been &quot;[very] Midwestern&quot; – he said that he was wanting to distance himself from associations with the series and that he was excited &quot;to see how people would react to such a crazy change&quot;.

A release party for &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; was held on April 27, 2005, at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood. The date was chosen to follow &quot;Eating Out&quot;&#x27;s Spring premiere in US theaters.

&quot;You Turn It On&quot; was released as &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;&#x27;s first single. The song debuted at number forty-eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Play Chart, where it spent eleven weeks, peaking in early June at number twenty-one.

&quot;You&#x27;re Getting Crazy (Estas Enloqueciendo)&quot; was released in October as the album&#x27;s second single. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that it &quot;treads in similar territory [as &quot;You Turn It On&quot;] stirring the beats into a simmering frenzy.&quot; The song received multiple remixes by Mike Cruz and L.E.X, which Edgemedianetwork.com called &quot;as slick, upbeat and professional as anything else currently climbing the charts.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; suggested that the song could become a hit, if Verraros released an accompanying music video, although no music videos were ever released for any of the songs on &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;.

Shortly after releasing &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, Verraros moved back to Crystal Lake, where he lived with his family for a time. Over the summer of 2005, he performed at the wrap party for &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s fourth season, served as a judge during the finals of &quot;Windy City Gay Idol&quot; (held by the &quot;Windy City Times&quot; at the Circuit Nightclub in Chicago), attended a pride ceremony held by the New York City Council, and also served as a judge at the World of Chocolate, a charity event for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. He participated in several local events around Chicago during this time and performed in multiple pride events, including the LA Pride and Chicago Pride parades. He also performed, along with &quot;American Idol&quot; second season third place finalist Kimberley Locke, at the Kansas City Gay Pride Festival in June and at the New York City Gay Life Expo in November. A club tour was considered to promote &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;.

===2006–2007: &quot;Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds&quot; and unrealized film projects===
Twice in the mid-2000s, Verraros was called a &quot;gay icon&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, first in 2004, and again in 2006. The &quot;New York Post&quot; noted in 2006 that Verraros had &quot;gained a cult following&quot; due to his role in &quot;Eating Out&quot;. In 2009, PopCrush claimed that &quot;almost immediately&quot; after appearing on &quot;American Idol&quot;, Verraros had become &quot;a huge symbol within the LGBT community&quot;, and that same year, the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; wrote that Verraros &quot;has been a fixture in the gay world...practically becoming a gay sex-symbol through the years.&quot; Verraros remained the only &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist to be publicly out until 2006, when his fellow first season finalist R.J. Helton came out. Helton had confided in Verraros about his sexual orientation on the night of the first-season finale, shortly before the group went on tour and before Helton had come out to any of the other first season finalists.

Verraros returned to the role of Kyle in &quot;Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds&quot;, which filmed during the Summer of 2006 and screened in several film festivals, before receiving a theatrical release on November 22. Brocka returned as co-writer, but passed directorial duties over to the first film&#x27;s Film editor, Phillip J. Bartell. The film features a song written by Verraros and Lopez, called &quot;You Make It Better&quot;, which was released as a single on July 17, 2007. Like its predecessor, &quot;Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds&quot; received mostly negative reviews. It was described as a cinematic landmark however, by multiple publications, for being the first sequel to a gay film.

In June 2006, the &quot;Windy City Times&quot; included Verraros in its &quot;30 Under 30&quot; list of young figures who had made positive contributions to the LGBTQ community. Throughout that year, Verraros continued performing at local events around Chicago; he was also featured on &quot;American Idol Rewind&quot;, filmed a guest appearance for the pilot of a cooking show called &quot;The Astrological Kitchen&quot;, and released a duet called &quot;Sweat&quot; with indie artist Jamie O&#x27;Brien. Once again, Verraros was named to &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Most Intriguing People&quot; list for that year.

In November 2006, it was reported that Verraros was living in East Dundee, Illinois, with his long-time boyfriend. It was also reported at this time that Verraros&#x27; second album would be released in 2007. In a December 2006 interview with gay-interest website Atlantaboy.com, Verraros said that &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; had been &quot;pretty much all over the place&quot; and that his next album would be &quot;more focused&quot;, while in April 2007, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; wrote that a follow-up to &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; was scheduled to be released that May. Verraros had also told Atlantaboy.com that he was &quot;heading more toward the film thing&quot; and that if he ever released a music video, he would hope to co-direct it. Around this time, he mentioned that he had been cast in three films; one was described as a dark LA-based romance, in which he would play a cocaine addict who falls in love with a struggling actor, another, referred to by the title &quot;Copacabana: Of Love and Shadows&quot;, was described as a Rio de Janeiro-based musical, in which Verraros would play both male and female roles; and the third, referred to by the title &quot;Pizza on Sunset&quot;, was described as a gay LA-based romantic comedy. By July 2007, Verraros still had not released his second album. It was announced over the summer that he was &quot;writing and recording [the album] in Malibu, California&quot; with producers Gary Miller and John Porter. On a July podcast for the &quot;Windy City Times&quot;, Verraros said that he was aiming for a January 2008 release.

===2007–present: Return to &quot;American Idol&quot;-related projects, marriage, and &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot;===
The 2007 book &quot;Chicken Soup for the American Idol Soul&quot; by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, and Deborah Poneman, features a chapter about Verraros, which Poneman called her favorite story in the book. During a press interview, Poneman said, &quot;I thought it was so amazing that a kid got to number eight or nine on &#x27;American Idol&#x27; with parents who are deaf...His story makes me cry, when he realized that even though the whole country was cheering for him because they loved his voice, the two people that he loved the most would never be able to hear him sing.&quot; Verraros appeared at multiple book signings in Illinois during January 2008 with Poseman and &quot;American Idol&quot; sixth season finalist Gina Glocksen.
Throughout the first half of 2008, Verraros recapped the seventh season of &quot;American Idol&quot; for ChicagoPride.com and co-hosted video recaps of that season with Penny Frulla for AfterElton.com. He was also featured on Usmagazine.com as a guest recapper for that season&#x27;s Top 12 episode. In January 2008, the &quot;Chicago Free Press&quot; named Verraros &quot;Best LGBT Musician of 2007&quot; in its &quot;Pressie Awards&quot;. In a subsequent Myspace post expressing his gratitude for the award, Verraros announced that his second album, which still had not been released, would be called &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; (AfterElton.com had previously reported that the album would be called &quot;Chapter Two&quot;). Verraros accepted the Pressie award in March, around which time he said that &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; would be &quot;coming out in the next couple of months.&quot;

Verraros cameoed as a priest in &quot;Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild!&quot;, which was released in the Summer of 2008. That same year, the electronica album &quot;Ear Therapy&quot; was released by DJ Russ Harris, which features Verraros on the track &quot;Another Lifetime&quot;, and the following year, Verraros released three new singles on iTunes – &quot;Touch (Don&#x27;t U Want 2)&quot; on January 20; &quot;Electric Love&quot; on May 26; and &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; on November 9. All three songs were written and produced by Gabe Lopez, whose official website announced that the accompanying album&#x27;s release date had been pushed back to late 2010. Samuel Lora of the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; gave &quot;Touch (Don&#x27;t U Want 2)&quot; a negative review, calling it &quot;simple and vapid&quot;. He also wrote that the song &quot;is overdone with heavy beats and crowding vocals&quot;. &quot;Electric Love&quot; fared somewhat better with Lora, who called it &quot;pretty decent&quot; but also felt that it was mimicking the sound of other, more successful artists. Lora likened the song to a &quot;less powerful&quot; version of &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; by the Backstreet Boys or something by &quot;Nick Carter if he were making Justin Timberlake music&quot;. Lora had kinder words for &quot;You Make It Better&quot;, which had been released as a single two years earlier.

In November 2009, Verraros served as a judge for Rialto Idol, a singing competition held by the Rialto Square Theatre for the ComEd Festival of Trees. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported in March 2010 that Verraros was looking for &quot;an indie label to release [&quot;Do Not Disturb&quot;].&quot; Several years earlier, in 2006, Verraros had mentioned the possibility of his second album being released through Sony BMG&#x27;s then-newly formed gay-focused label, &quot;Music With a Twist&quot;. Ultimately, &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; was released on October 18, 2011, through Red Queen Music – Sound Axis. Ten tracks are included on the album, out of dozens that were written and recorded throughout the development process. Verraros told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2010 that &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; would likely be his final album, saying &quot;I think I&#x27;d like to just pull away [from singing] and focus [more on acting].&quot;

====Marriage====
On September 6, 2009, Verraros married Bill Brennan in their shared home state of Illinois. The couple first met through MySpace in 2005, at which point they decided to meet in person, after realizing that they only lived about twenty minutes away from each other. A few months later, they moved in together. Brennan proposed to Verraros two-and-a-half years after they began dating. Although Illinois did not legally recognize gay marriage in 2009, Verraros said that he and Brennan &quot;wanted the day to be a reflection of [their] love and commitment to each other as well as a statement to other gay couples in Illinois&quot;. Each of the groom&#x27;s fathers served as their best men in the wedding. The song &quot;You Make It Better&quot; from the film &quot;Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds&quot; was written by Verraros about Brennan and was included in the music set list for their wedding. The marriage was later legalized in Iowa.

Brennan is the president of Bridal Expo Chicago and Bridal Expo Milwaukee. In 2006, Verraros signed an endorsement deal to serve as spokesman for the business; he eventually became executive vice president. Kelly Clarkson and Verraros maintained a friendship after competing on &quot;American Idol&quot; together, and Verraros helped design the headpiece that Clarkson wore for her 2013 wedding.

By 2019, Verraros and Brennan had separated. Verraros is currently engaged. On November 20, 2021, Verraros married Sean Michael Buck.

<doc id="536380" wikidata="Q628490" url="?curid=536380" title="Mountain Jews">
<text>Mountain Jews are the Mizrahi Jewish subgroup of the eastern and northern Caucasus, mainly Azerbaijan, and various republics in the Russian Federation: Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Kabardino-Balkaria. Mountain Jews took shape as a community after Qajar Iran ceded the areas in which they lived to the Russian Empire as part of the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813.

The forerunners of the Mountain Jewish community have inhabited Ancient Persia since the 5th century BCE. The language spoken by Mountain Jews, called Judeo-Tat, is an ancient Southwest Iranian language which integrates many elements of Ancient Hebrew.

It is believed that Mountain Jews in Persia, as early as the 8th century BCE, continued to migrate east; settling in mountainous areas of the Caucasus. Mountain Jews survived numerous historical vicissitudes by settling in extremely remote and mountainous areas. They were known to be accomplished warriors and horseback riders.

Mountain Jews are distinct from Georgian Jews of the Caucasus Mountains. The two groups are culturally differentiated: they speak different languages and have differences in customs.

==History==
===Early history===
Mountain Jews, or Jews of the Caucasus, have inhabited the Caucasus since the fifth century CE. Being the descendants of the Persian Jews of Iran, their migration from Persia proper to the Caucasus took place in the Sasanian era (224–651). It is believed that they arrived in Persia from ancient Israel as early as the 8th century BCE. Other sources attest that Mountain Jews were present in the region of Azerbaijan at least since 457 BCE. However, Mountain Jews only took shape as a community after Qajar Iran ceded the areas in which they lived to the Russian Empire per the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813.

Mountain Jews have an oral tradition, passed down from generation to generation, that they are descended from the Ten Lost Tribes exiled by the king of Assyria (Ashur), who ruled over northern Iraq from Mosul (across the Tigris River from the ancient city of Nineveh). The reference most likely is to Shalmaneser, the King of Assyria mentioned in II Kings 18:9–12. According to local Jewish tradition, some 19,000 Jews departed Jerusalem (used here as a generic term for the Land of Israel) and passed through Syria, Babylonia, and Persia and then, heading north, entered into Media.

Mountain Jews maintained a strong military tradition. For this reason, some historians believe they may be descended from Jewish military colonists, settled by Parthian and Sassanid rulers in the Caucasus as frontier guards against nomadic incursions from the Pontic steppe.

A 2002 study by geneticist Dror Rosengarten found that the paternal haplotypes of Mountain Jews &quot;were shared with other Jewish communities and were consistent with a Mediterranean origin.&quot; In addition, Y-DNA testing of Mountain Jews has shown they have Y-DNA haplotypes related to those of other Jewish communities. The Semitic origin of Mountain Jews is also evident in their culture and language.

===1600s–1800s: &quot;The Jewish Valley&quot; ===
By the early 17th century, Mountain Jews formed many small settlements throughout the mountain valleys of Dagestan. One valley, located 10 km south of Derbent, close to the shore of the Caspian Sea, was predominantly populated by Mountain Jews. Their Muslim neighbors called this area &quot;Jewish Valley&quot;. The Jewish Valley grew to be a semi-independent Jewish state, with its spiritual and political center located in its largest settlement of Aba-Sava (1630–1800). The valley prospered until the end of the 18th century, when its settlements were brutally destroyed in the war between Sheikh-Ali-Khan, who swore loyalty to the Russian Empire, and Surkhai-Khan, the ruler of Kumukh. Many Mountain Jews were slaughtered, with survivors escaping to Derbent where they received the protection of Fatali Khan, the ruler of Quba Khanate. 
In Chechnya, Mountain Jews partially assimilated into Chechen society by forming a Jewish teip, the Zhugtii. In Chechen society, ethnic minorities residing in areas demographically dominated by Chechens have the option of forming a teip in order to properly participate in the developments of Chechen society such as making alliances and gaining representation in the &quot;Mekhk Khell&quot;, a supreme ethnonational council that is occasionally compared to a parliament. Teips of minority-origin have also been made by ethnic Poles, Germans, Georgians, Armenians, Kumyks, Russians, Kalmyks, Circassians, Andis, Avars, Dargins, Laks, Persians, Arabs, Ukrainians and Nogais, with the German teip having been formed as recently as the 1940s when Germans in Siberian exile living among Chechens assimilated.

Mountain Jews have also settled in the territory of modern Azerbaijan. The main Mountain Jewish settlement in Azerbaijan was and remains Qırmızı Qəsəbə, also called Jerusalem of the Caucasus. In Russian, Qırmızı Qəsəbə was once called (translit. &#x27;), &quot;Jewish Village&quot;; but during Soviet times it was renamed (translit. &#x27;), &quot;Red Village&quot;.

In the 18th–19th centuries, Mountain Jews resettled from the highland to the coastal lowlands but carried the name &quot;Mountain Jews&quot; with them. In the villages (&quot;aouls&quot;), the Mountain Jews had settled in separate sections. In the lowland towns, they also lived in concentrated neighborhoods, but their dwellings did not differ from those of their neighbors. Mountain Jews retained the dress of the highlanders. They have continued to follow Jewish dietary laws and affirm their faith in family life. 

In 1902, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that clans of Jewish origin, who maintain many of the customs and the principal forms of religious worship of their ancestors, were discovered in the remote regions of the Eastern Caucasus.

=== Soviet times, Holocaust and modern history ===
By 1926, more than 85% of Mountain Jews in Dagestan were already classed as urban. Mountain Jews were mainly concentrated in the cities of Makhachkala, Buynaksk, Derbent, Nalchik and Grozny in North Caucasus; and Quba and Baku in Azerbaijan.

In the Second World War, some Mountain Jews settlements in North Caucasus, including parts of their area in Kabardino-Balkaria were occupied by the German Wehrmacht at the end of 1942. During this period, they killed several hundreds of Mountain Jews until the Germans retreated early 1943. On 19 August 1942, Germans killed 472 Mountain Jews near the village of Bogdanovka, and on September 20 the Germans killed 378 Jews in the village of Menzhinskoe. A total of some 1000–1500 Mountain Jews were murdered during the Holocaust by bullets. Many Mountain Jews survived, however, because German troops did not reach all their areas; in addition, attempts succeeded to convince local German authorities that this group were &quot;religious&quot; but not &quot;racial&quot; Jews.

The Soviet Army&#x27;s advances in the area brought the Nalchik community under its protection. The Mountain Jewish community of Nalchik was the largest Mountain Jewish community occupied by Nazis, and the vast majority of the population has survived. With the help of their Kabardian neighbors, Mountain Jews of Nalchik convinced the local German authorities that they were Tats, the native people similar to other Caucasus Mountain peoples, not related to the ethnic Jews, who merely adopted Judaism. The annihilation of the Mountain Jews was suspended, contingent on racial investigation. Although the Nazis watched the village carefully, Rabbi Nachamil ben Hizkiyahu hid Sefer Torahs by burying them in a fake burial ceremony. The city was liberated a few months later.

In 1944, the NKVD deported the entire Chechen populace that surrounded the Mountain Jews in Chechnya, and moved other ethnic groups into their homes; Mountain Jews mostly refused to take the homes of deported Chechens while there are some reports of deported Chechens entrusting their homes to Jews in order to keep them safe.

Given the marked changes in the 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and rise of nationalism in the region, many Mountain Jews permanently left their hometowns in the Caucasus and relocated to Moscow or abroad. During the First Chechen War, many Mountain Jews left due to the Russian invasion and indiscriminate bombardment of civilian population by the Russian military. Despite historically close relations between Jews and Chechens, many also suffered high rate of kidnappings and violence at the hands of armed ethnic Chechen gangs who ransomed their freedom to &quot;Israel and the international Jewish community&quot;. The majority of Mountain Jews emigrated to Israel with a considerable amout emigrating to the United States after the fall of the soviet union. 

Today, Qırmızı Qəsəbə in Azerbaijan remains the biggest settlement of Mountain Jews in the world, with the current population over 3,000.

==Economy==
While elsewhere in the Russian Empire, Jews were prohibited from owning land (excluding the Jews of Siberia and Central Asia), at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Mountain Jews owned land and were farmers and gardeners, growing mainly grain. Their oldest occupation was rice-growing, but they also raised silkworms and cultivated tobacco and vineyards. Mountain Jews and their Christian Armenian neighbors were the main producers of wine, as Muslims were prohibited by their religion from producing or consuming alcohol. Judaism limited some types of meat consumption. Unlike their neighbors, the Jews raised few domestic animals, although tanning was their third most important economic activity after farming and gardening. At the end of the 19th century, 6% of Jews were engaged in this trade. Handicrafts and commerce were mostly practiced by Jews in towns.

The Soviet authorities bound the Mountain Jews to collective farms, but allowed them to continue their traditional cultivation of grapes, tobacco, and vegetables; and making wine. In practical terms, the Jews are no longer isolated from other ethnic groups.

With increasing urbanization and sovietization in progress, by the 1930s, a layer of intelligentsia began to form. By the late 1960s, academic professionals, such as pharmacists, medical doctors, and engineers, were common in the community. Mountain Jews worked in more professional positions than did Georgian Jews, though less than the Soviet Ashkenazi community, who were based in larger cities of Russia. A sizable number of Mountain Jews worked in the entertainment industry in Dagestan. The republic&#x27;s dancing ensemble &quot;Lezginka&quot; was led by Tankho Israilov, a Mountain Jew, from 1958 to 1979.

==Religion==
Mountain Jews are not Sephardim (from the Iberian Peninsula) nor Ashkenazim (from Central Europe) but rather of Persian Jewish origin, and most of them follow Edot HaMizrach customs. Mountain Jews tenaciously held to their religion throughout the centuries, developing their own unique traditions and religious practices. Mountain Jewish traditions are infused with teachings of Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism. Mountain Jews have also developed and retained unique customs different from other Jews, such as &quot;govgil&quot;, an end-of-Passover picnic celebration involving the whole community.

Mountain Jews have traditionally maintained a two-tiered rabbinate, distinguishing between a rabbi and a dayan. &quot;Rabbi&quot; was a title given to religious leaders performing the functions of liturgical preachers (maggids) and cantors (hazzans) in synagogues (&quot;nimaz&quot;), teachers in Jewish schools (cheders), and shochets. The &quot;dayan&quot; was a chief rabbi of a town, presiding over beit dins and representing the highest religious authority for the town and nearby smaller settlements. Dayans were elected democratically by community leaders.

The religious survival of the community was not without difficulties. In the prosperous days of the Jewish valley (roughly 1600-1800 CE), the spiritual center of Mountain Jews centered on the settlement of Aba-Sava. Many works of religious significance were written in Aba-Sava. Here, Elisha ben Schmuel Ha-Katan wrote several of his piyyuts. Theologian Gershon Lala ben Moshke Nakdi, who lived in Aba-Sava in 18th century, wrote a commentary on the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides. Rabbi Mattathia ben Shmuel ha-Kohen wrote his kabbalistic essay &quot;Kol Hamevaser&quot; in Aba-Sava. With the brutal destruction of Aba-Sava in roughly 1800 CE, however, the religious center of Mountain Jews moved to Derbent.

Prominent rabbis of Mountain Jews in the nineteenth century included: Rabbi Gershom son of Rabbi Reuven of Qırmızı Qəsəbə, Shalom ben Melek of Temir-Khan-Shura (today known as Buynaksk), Chief Rabbi of Dagestan Jacob ben Isaac, and Rabbi Hizkiyahu ben Avraam of Nalchik, whose son, Rabbi Nahamiil ben Hizkiyahu, later played a crucial role in saving Nalchik&#x27;s Jewish community from the Nazis. In the early decades of the Soviet Union, the government took steps to suppress religion. Thus, in the 1930s, the Soviet Union closed synagogues belonging to Mountain Jews. The same procedures were implemented among other ethnicities and religions. Soviet authorities propagated the myth that Mountain Jews were not part of the world&#x27;s Jewish people at all, but rather members of the Tat community that settled in the region. Soviet antisemitic rhetoric was intensified during Khrushchev&#x27;s rule. Some of the synagogues were later reopened in the 1940s. The closing of the synagogues in the 1930s was part of a communist ideology that resisted religion of any kind.
At the beginning of the 1950s, there were synagogues in all major Mountain Jewish communities. By 1966, reportedly six synagogues remained; some were confiscated by the Soviet authorities. While Mountain Jews observed the rituals of circumcision, marriage and burial, as well as Jewish holidays, other precepts of Jewish faith were observed less carefully. Yet, the community&#x27;s ethnic identity remained unshaken despite the Soviet efforts. Cases of intermarriage with Muslims in Azerbaijan or Dagestan were rare as both groups practice endogamy. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Mountain Jews experienced a significant religious revival, with increasing religious observance by members of the younger generation.

==Educational institutions, language, literature==

Mountain Jews speak Judeo-Tat, also called Juhuri, a form of Persian; it belongs to the southwestern group of the Iranian division of the Indo-European languages. Judeo-Tat has Semitic (Hebrew/Aramaic/Arabic) elements on all linguistic levels. Among other Semitic elements, Judeo-Tat has the Hebrew sound &quot;ayin&quot; (ע), whereas no neighboring languages have it. Until the early Soviet period, the language was written with semi-cursive Hebrew alphabet. Later, Judeo-Tat books, newspapers, textbooks, and other materials were printed with a Latin alphabet and finally in Cyrillic, which is still most common today. The first Judeo-Tat-language newspaper, &quot;Zakhmetkesh&quot; (Working People), was published in 1928 and operated until the second half of the twentieth century. 
Originally, only boys were educated through synagogue schools. Starting from the 1860s, many well-off families switched to home-schooling, hiring private tutors, who taught their sons not only Hebrew, but also Russian. In the early 20th century, with advance of sovietization, Judeo-Tat became the language of instruction at newly founded elementary schools attended by both Mountain Jewish boys and girls. This policy continued until the beginning of World War II, when schools switched to Russian as the central government emphasized acquisition of Russian as the official language of the Soviet Union.

Mountain Jewish community has had notable figures in public health, education, culture, and art.

In the 21st century, the Russian government started encouraging the revival of cultural life of minorities. In Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria, Judeo-Tat and Hebrew courses have been introduced in traditionally Mountain Jewish schools. In Dagestan, there is support for the revival of the Judeo-Tat-language theater and the publication of newspapers in that language.

==Culture==
===Military tradition===
&quot;And we, the TatsWe, Samson warriors,Bar Kochba&#x27;s heirs...we went into battlesand bitterly, heroicallystruggled for our freedom
&quot;-&quot;The Song of the Mountain Jews&quot;&quot;

Mountain Jews have a military tradition and have been historically viewed as fierce warriors. Some historians suggest that the group traces its beginnings to Persian-Jewish soldiers who were stationed in the Caucasus by the Sasanian kings in the fifth or sixth century to protect the area from the onslaughts of the Huns and other nomadic invaders from the east. Men were typically heavily armed and some slept without removing their weapons.

===Dress===
Over time the Mountain Jews adopted the dress of their Muslim neighbors. Men typically wore chokhas and covered their head with papakhas, many variations of which could symbolize the men&#x27;s social status. Wealthier men&#x27;s dress was adorned with many pieces of jewelry, including silver and gold-decorated weaponry, pins, chains, belts, or &quot;kisets&quot; (small purse used to hold tobacco or coins). Women&#x27;s dress was typically of simpler design in dark tones, made from silk, brocade, velvet, satin and later wool. They decorated the fabric with beads, gold pins or buttons, and silver gold-plated belts. Outside the house, both single and married women covered their hair with headscarves.

===Cuisine===

<text>Rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) is a type of vehicle armour made of a single steel composition hot-rolled to improve its material characteristics, as opposed to layered or cemented armour. Its first common application was in tanks. After World War II, it began to fall out of use on main battle tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles intended to see front-line combat as new anti-tank weapon technologies were developed which were capable of relatively easily penetrating rolled homogeneous armour plating even of significant thickness.

Today, the term is primarily used as a unit of measurement of the protection offered by armour on a vehicle (often composed of materials that may not actually contain steel, or even contain any metals) in equivalent &quot;millimetres of RHA&quot;, referring to the thickness of RHA that would provide the same protection. Typically, modern composite armour can provide the same amount of protection with much thinner and lighter construction than its protective equivalence in RHA. Likewise, the term is also used as a unit of measurement of penetration capability of armour-piercing weaponry, in terms of the millimetres of RHA that the weapon system can reliably penetrate.

==Composition==
Armoured steel must be hard, yet resistant to shock, in order to resist high velocity metal projectiles. Steel with these characteristics is produced by processing cast steel billets of appropriate size and then rolling them into plates of required thickness. Hot rolling homogenizes the grain structure of the steel, changing the crystalline structure of the steel and normalizing it.

RHA is homogeneous because its structure and composition are uniform throughout its thickness. The opposite of homogeneous steel plate is cemented or face-hardened steel plate, where the face of the steel is composed differently from the substrate. The face of the steel, which starts as an RHA plate, is hardened by a heat-treatment process.

==History==
From the invention of tanks through to the Second World War, tank armour increased in thickness to resist the increasing size and power of anti-tank guns. A tank with sufficient armour could resist the largest anti-tank guns then in use.

RHA was commonly used during this period (combined with other plate alloys and cast steel armour), and the power of anti-tank guns was measured by the thickness of RHA they could penetrate. This standard test has remained in use despite the modern usage of many other types of armour, some of which do not include steel or any other metals.

RHA was in common use as primary armour until after World War II, during which a new generation of anti-tank rounds using shaped charges came into use instead of heavy high-velocity projectiles.

==Current use==
Since World War II, because of a reduction in effectiveness against new weapons (mainly shaped charges and improved kinetic energy penetrators), RHA has largely been superseded by composite armour, which incorporates air spaces and materials such as ceramics or plastics in addition to steel, and explosive reactive armour.

For the testing and calibration of anti-tank guns, the term &quot;rolled homogeneous armour equivalency&quot; (&quot;RHAe&quot;) is used when giving an estimate of either the penetrative capability of a projectile or the protective capability of a type of armour which may or may not be steel. Because of variations in armour shape, quality, material, and case-by-case performance, the usefulness of RHAe in comparing different armour is only approximate.

Currently, most armoured vehicles have their basic structures formed from RHA to lend general strength and toughness.

==Specifications==
The US army has several standards for rolled homogeneous armour:
* Current use is based on military standard MIL-DTL-12560 by several manufacturers. The typical Brinell Hardness range of MIL-A 12560 is 302-400
** The MIL-12560K standard actually specifies four classes of hardnesses. The softest class I rates as 260-310. The toughest Class 4 rates as 420-470. (K is the revision number of the standard.)
* MIL-DTL-46177 is an older, now-replaced standard for a high hardness steel RHA. It specifies a harder steel that is nearly identical to AR500 in terms of tensile and yield strength. The Brinell hardness of AR500 is in the 477-534 range. MIL-DTL-46100E specifies a steel of identical hardness.
* MIL-DTL-32332 specifies ultra-hard steel, with Brinell hardness in excess of 570.

A Chinese publication lists 30MnCrNiMo &quot;685&quot; steel as the material used in Chinese rolled armor plates, with a Brinell Hardness of HBW 444-514 (thin) / 429-495 (thick). According to the same publication, older vehicles use a 22SiMn2TiB &quot;616&quot; steel with a hardness of HBS ≤ 219.

<text>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are a rock band formed in Melbourne in 1983 by lead vocalist Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and German guitarist-vocalist Blixa Bargeld. The band has featured international personnel throughout its career and presently consists of Cave, violinist and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey (all from Australia), guitarist George Vjestica (United Kingdom), touring keyboardist/percussionist Larry Mullins, also known as Toby Dammit (United States), and drummers Thomas Wydler (Switzerland) and Jim Sclavunos (United States). Described as &quot;one of the most original and celebrated bands of the post-punk and alternative rock eras in the &#x27;80s and onward&quot;, they have released eighteen studio albums and completed numerous international tours.

The band was founded following the demise of Cave and Harvey&#x27;s former group the Birthday Party, the members of which met at a boarding school in Melbourne. Throughout the 1980s, beginning with their debut studio album &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; (1984), the band drew largely on post-punk, blues and gothic rock, and formed an evolving, multinational lineup, bringing in musicians such as Blixa Bargeld, Barry Adamson and Kid Congo Powers. The band later softened their sound and incorporated other influences on studio albums such as &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; (1997). Following Harvey&#x27;s departure in 2009, the band broadened their sound further to include electronic and ambient styles, which feature prominently on the trilogy of studio albums &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot; (2013), &quot;Skeleton Tree&quot; (2016) and &quot;Ghosteen&quot; (2019). &quot;Wild God&quot; is their most recent, released in 2024.

==History==
===Formation and early releases (1983–1985)===
The project that later evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds began following the demise of the Birthday Party in August 1983. Both Cave and Harvey were members of the Birthday Party, along with guitarist Rowland S. Howard and bassist Tracy Pew. During the recording sessions of the Birthday Party&#x27;s scheduled EPs &quot;Mutiny/The Bad Seed&quot;, internal disputes developed in the band. The difference in Cave and Howard&#x27;s approach to songwriting was a major factor, as Cave explained in an interview with &quot;On The Street&quot;: &quot;the main reason why The Birthday Party broke up was that the sort of songs that I was writing and the sort of songs that Rowland was writing were just totally at odds with each other.&quot; Following the departure of Harvey, they officially disbanded. Cave also said that &quot;it probably would have gone on longer, but Mick has the ability to judge things much more clearly than the rest of us.&quot;
An embryonic version of what became Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds was formed in the Birthday Party&#x27;s then-home of London in September 1983, with Cave, Harvey (acting primarily as drummer), Einstürzende Neubauten frontman Blixa Bargeld, Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and JG Thirlwell, known for his solo project Foetus. The band was initially formed as a backing band for Cave&#x27;s intended solo project &quot;Man or Myth?&quot;, which had been approved by the record label Mute Records. During September and October 1983, they recorded material with producer Flood, although the sessions were cut short due to Cave&#x27;s touring with the Immaculate Consumptive, another project formed with Thirlwell, Lydia Lunch and Marc Almond. In December 1983 Cave returned to Melbourne, Australia, where he formed a temporary line-up of his backing band, due to Bargeld&#x27;s absence, that included Pew and guitarist Hugo Race. The band performed their first live show at the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda on 31 December 1983.

Following a short Australian tour, and during a period when they were without management, Cave and his band returned to London. Cave, Harvey, Bargeld, Race and Adamson formed the project&#x27;s first consistent line-up, while Cave&#x27;s longtime girlfriend Anita Lane was credited as a lyricist on occasional songs (e.g., the title track of 1984&#x27;s &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;). The group, which up to this time had been nameless, adopted the moniker Nick Cave and the Cavemen, which they used for the first six months of their career. However, they were later renamed Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in May 1984, in reference to the final Birthday Party EP &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;. They began recording sessions for their debut album in March 1984 at London&#x27;s Trident Studios and these sessions, together with the abandoned &quot;Man or Myth?&quot; sessions from September–October 1983 that were recorded at The Garden studios, formed the album &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, released on Mute Records in 1984. Thirlwell left during the recording sessions for &quot;Eternity&quot;, citing creative disagreements and desires to work on his own solo material. Race, and touring guitarist Edward Clayton-Jones, left to form the Wreckery in Melbourne.

===Move to Germany and stylistic evolution (1985–1989)===

After the departure of Race and Lane, the remaining members moved to West Berlin, Germany in 1985 and released a second album &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot;. The album was heavily influenced by the gothic Americana of the American South and blues music, exemplified in songs such as &quot;Tupelo&quot; and &quot;Blind Lemon Jefferson&quot;, which reference the birth of Elvis Presley and Blind Lemon Jefferson respectively. Released the following year, the album &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot; explored such influences with renditions of material by Johnny Cash, John Lee Hooker and Lead Belly. The 1986 album also marked the arrival of Swiss drummer Thomas Wydler, a member of Die Haut, and featured guest appearances from Race, Pew, and Birthday Party guitarist Howard, who had briefly toured with the Bad Seeds as a substitute member in 1985. Pew&#x27;s death from an epileptic seizure also occurred in 1986.

The band garnered an increased following due to a second 1986 album release, &quot;Your Funeral, My Trial&quot;, which coincided with Adamson&#x27;s departure. Due to Adamson&#x27;s departure and an injury which made Wydler unable to play the drums, Harvey recorded the bulk of the album&#x27;s instrumentation with the only other member who contributed instruments on every track being Bargeld. &quot;Tender Prey&quot;, the dark, brooding 1988 follow-up, saw the arrival of American guitarist and The Gun Club stalwart Kid Congo Powers—Harvey made the transition to bass—and short-tenured German keyboardist Roland Wolf. The single &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; chronicled an unrepentant prisoner on death row and further increased the group&#x27;s critical acclaim and commercial attention. The track was later covered by Johnny Cash on his 2000 album &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot;. Despite the increasing level of success, the drug-related issues of band members became problematic. The documentary film &quot;The Road to God Knows Where&quot;, directed by Uli M Schueppel, depicts a five-week period of the United States leg of their 1989 tour.

Cave and his bandmates also pursued other creative ambitions around this time. In 1987, the Bad Seeds appeared in the Wim Wenders film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, and Cave was featured in the 1988 film &quot;Ghosts... of the Civil Dead&quot;, which he and Race co-wrote. Cave&#x27;s first novel &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot; was published in 1989.

===Growing success (1989–1997)===
After a period of time in New York City, Cave relocated to São Paulo, Brazil, shortly after the final tour for &quot;Tender Prey&quot; and, after successfully finishing drug rehabilitation, began experimenting with piano-driven ballads. The result of this post-rehabilitation period was 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Good Son&quot;. Featuring a sorrowful and longing tone, the album was well-received both critically and commercially, and yielded the singles &quot;The Weeping Song&quot; (featuring vocals from Bargeld) and &quot;The Ship Song&quot;.

Two established Australian musicians, Casey of the Triffids and solo artist and keyboardist Savage, replaced the departing Powers and Wolf. The addition of Casey on bass allowed Harvey to return to guitar. Their next record, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot;, marked a change towards a harder rock sound. Producer David Briggs, known for his work with Neil Young, was enlisted for the recording process. The tour for the album is documented on 1993&#x27;s live album &quot;Live Seeds&quot; and showcases the new group&#x27;s aggressive sound.

In mid-1993, the group returned once more to London and recorded &quot;Let Love In&quot;, the follow-up album. &quot;Let Love In&quot; expanded upon the fuller ensemble sound that was established in &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; and featured contributions from Howard, Ellis, Tex Perkins (Beasts of Bourbon) and David McComb (The Triffids). Several popular songs, such as &quot;Red Right Hand&quot; (which featured in the &quot;Scream&quot; film series and was used as the theme song for Peaky Blinders) and &quot;Loverman&quot; (later covered by Metallica), were drawn from the album. During the promotional tour for the album, American percussionist and drummer Jim Sclavunos joined the group.

In 1996 the band released &quot;Murder Ballads&quot;, their best-selling album to date. Centered on the subject of murder, the album includes a cover of the folk song &quot;Henry Lee&quot;—a duet with British rock singer PJ Harvey, with whom Cave had a brief relationship— and &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, a duet with Australian pop idol Kylie Minogue. The Minogue collaboration was a mainstream hit in the UK and Australia, and won three Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards, including Song of the Year. It was at this time that Ellis of the Dirty Three began regularly working with the band and eventually became Cave&#x27;s primary collaborator.

The sound of &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot;, released in 1997, was a radical departure from the archetypal and violent narratives of the band&#x27;s past, featuring songs about relationships, loss, and longing, often with sparse arrangements. Cave revealed his mindset during the creation of the album in a 2008 interview: &quot;When I was making half that record I was furious because certain things had happened in my love life that seriously pissed me off. And some of those songs came straight out of that. I don&#x27;t regret making it ... the songs are of a moment when you felt a certain way. When ... you just think, &#x27;Fuck – please! The album&#x27;s corresponding tour was later documented on the 2008 live album &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. After the release of the album, Cave embarked on a brief hiatus, during which time he remarried.

===Further musical refinement; Bargeld&#x27;s departure (1997–2005)===

Following Cave&#x27;s hiatus the band oversaw the release of &quot;Original Seeds&quot;, a compilation of material from other artists that influenced the group, as well as their own &quot;best of&quot; album &quot;The Best of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds&quot;. In 1999 and 2000, the band reconvened to record two improvisations on Anita Lane&#x27;s &quot;Sex O&#x27;Clock&quot;. The proper follow-up to &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; was 2001&#x27;s &quot;No More Shall We Part&quot;. The record featured guest appearances by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle and was generally well received in reviews: one critic hailed the album as an &quot;entire album of deeply tragic and beautiful love songs without irony, sarcasm, or violent resolution&quot;, while also stating that the work is at risk of devolving &quot;into schmaltz&quot;.

The band then released &quot;Nocturama&quot; in 2003. The album marked a return to band-oriented and collaborative arrangements, as previous releases involved a decreased level of input from Cave&#x27;s bandmates. &quot;Nocturama&quot; garnered mixed reviews, with critic Eric Carr stating that &quot;in truth, it may still be the group&#x27;s best work since &quot;Let Love In&quot;, but it had the potential to be so much more&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Bargeld left the band after 20 years to devote more time to Einstürzende Neubauten.

In 2004 the band released the acclaimed two-disc set &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;, with Bargeld replaced by the English actor, guitarist and organist James Johnston, a member of Gallon Drunk and former guest member of the Bad Seeds from a Lollapalooza tour ten years prior (Johnston only played organs on the recordings, as Harvey contributed the guitar pieces). Conceived as two separate albums packaged together, the record featured a diversity of arrangement styles, including aggressive rock and choir-driven ballads. In 2005 the band released &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;, a three-volume, 56-song collection of B-sides, rarities and compilation tracks that was released on Mute Records in Europe, the US and the UK. &quot;The Abattoir Blues Tour&quot;, a two-CD, two-DVD box set with performances from the album&#x27;s promotional tour, was then released in 2007 in Europe and the US. The tour included guest backing vocalists Ase Bergstrom, Geo Onaymake, Eleanor Palmer and Wendi Rose.

Also in 2005, Cave completed work on his script for &quot;The Proposition&quot;, set in 19th-century Australia directed by John Hillcoat. Cave and Ellis collaborated on the film&#x27;s score, a partnership that later also scored the films &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Road&quot; (2009).

===Grinderman; Harvey&#x27;s departure (2006–2012)===
After operating for several years as a touring backing band for Cave&#x27;s solo work, Bad Seeds members Ellis, Sclavunos and Casey formed a new side-project Grinderman with Cave in 2006. The band, featuring Cave playing guitar for the first time, played garage rock-influenced music that still retained much of The Bad Seeds&#x27; aura and released a self-titled debut album in 2007. In October 2007 Cave was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and, in his acceptance speech, also inducted the members of The Bad Seeds and The Birthday Party, after explaining, &quot;I cannot really accept this until we get a few things straight. What I can&#x27;t figure out is why I am up here and The Bad Seeds aren&#x27;t?&quot;

Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released their 14th studio album &quot;Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!&quot; in 2008 and received a high level of critical acclaim. Inspired by the biblical story of Lazarus of Bethany, the album continued the punk and garage rock-inspired arrangements that were explored on the debut Grinderman album, resulting in what &quot;NME&quot; termed a &quot;gothic psycho-sexual apocalypse&quot;. The group then embarked on a North American and European tour is support of the album, with a seven-piece lineup that did not include Johnston, who had left the group after the album&#x27;s completion.

Cave and the band curated Australia&#x27;s first edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival that was held in various Australian locations during January 2009. On 22 January, after the festival&#x27;s completion, Harvey announced his departure from the band after 25 years, citing &quot;a variety of personal and professional reasons&quot;. Harvey concluded his public statement by stating, &quot;I shall continue working on the Bad Seeds back catalogue re-issues project over the coming year and look forward to the new opportunities I shall be able to accommodate as a result of my changed circumstances.&quot; Harvey&#x27;s departure was the end of a 36-year-long musical collaboration between Cave and Harvey, and Cave was left as the group&#x27;s only original member. The band enlisted guitarist Ed Kuepper, formerly of the Australian bands the Saints and the Laughing Clowns, as a touring member to complete the 2009 summer festival dates that were scheduled. Also in 2009, Cave published his second novel &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot;, and Mute Records commenced work on a series of remastered versions of the Bad Seeds&#x27; back catalogue (some of the remastered albums included documentary footage from Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard).

Following this string of activity, the Bad Seeds became dormant while Grinderman reactivated and released &quot;Grinderman 2&quot; in 2010. The group also attracted further attention when their song &quot;O Children&quot; appeared in the 2010 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;. In December 2011, Grinderman disbanded immediately following an Australian tour. Their final performance was at the Meredith Music Festival in rural Victoria.

===&quot;Push the Sky Away&quot;, &quot;Skeleton Tree&quot; and &quot;Ghosteen&quot; (2013–2023)===
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; 15th studio album &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot; was released in mid-February 2013. During the album&#x27;s recording, former member Barry Adamson rejoined the band as a bassist, then assumed a multi-instrumentalist (percussion, keyboards, vocals) role on subsequent tours. Kuepper briefly returned as the band&#x27;s touring guitarist, but was replaced by George Vjestica for the European leg of the tour; Vjestica&#x27;s 12-string guitar-playing was featured on several &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot; tracks.

During the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds summer US tour in 2013, a smaller incarnation of the band recorded Live from KCRW (Cave, Ellis, Casey, Sclavunos and Adamson). In 2014 Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds toured North America with Ellis, Adamson, Sclavunos, Casey plus Conway Savage and George Vjestica. Cave embarked on solo tours in Australia and New Zealand in late 2014 and Europe in 2015 with Adamson on keyboards and percussion, joined by the rhythm section of Wydler and Casey, and with Ellis as the featured multi-instrumentalist. 
In May 2015, Larry Mullins replaced Adamson as a guest touring member; Adamson has not returned since, and Mullins did not participate in sessions for the subsequent Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album.

On 2 June 2016, the official Nick Cave website announced a documentary film titled &quot;One More Time with Feeling&quot; (directed by Andrew Dominik) which was screened on 8 September 2016. It accompanies the band&#x27;s acclaimed 16th album titled &quot;Skeleton Tree&quot; (released 9 September 2016). In 2017, Cave begun writing songs for the next Bad Seeds record, which is set to complete a musical trilogy the band began with &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot;. Ellis and Cave played two orchestral shows at Hamer Hall in Melbourne, Australia on 9 and 10 August, featuring a selection of their various film scores.

On 23 September 2019, Cave formally announced the album &quot;Ghosteen&quot;, to be released at the beginning of October 2019. It premiered on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; YouTube channel on 3 October.

On 22 October 2021, the band released &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities Part II&quot;; the sequel to their 2005 compilation &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;. In June 2022, the band embarked upon their first tour since the onset of COVID-19, with their 2020 &quot;Ghosteen&quot; tour having previously been cancelled due to the pandemic. For the tour, the band were joined by four additional members – keyboardist Carly Paradis and backing vocalists Janet Ramus, T Jae Cole, and Subrina McCalla – alongside returning touring keyboardist Larry Mullins, now acting as touring drummer.

=== &quot;Wild God&quot; (2024–present) ===
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds 18th studio album &quot;Wild God&quot; was announced on 6 March 2024 and the title track was released as a single on the same day. A second single &quot;Frogs&quot; followed on 31 May and a third, &quot;Long Dark Night&quot;, on 23 July. The album was released on 30 August.

<text>The Winnipeg Free Press (or WFP; founded as the Manitoba Free Press) is a daily (excluding Sunday) broadsheet newspaper in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It provides coverage of local, provincial, national, and international news, as well as current events in sports, business, and entertainment and various consumer-oriented features, such as homes and automobiles appear on a weekly basis.

The &quot;WFP&quot; was founded in 1872, only two years after Manitoba became part of Canada, in 1870. The WFP&#x27;s founding predated Winnipeg&#x27;s own incorporation, in 1873. The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; has since become the oldest newspaper in Western Canada that is still active.

==Timeline==
November 30, 1872: The &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot; was launched by William Fisher Luxton and John A. Kenny. Luxton bought a press in New York City and, along with Kenny, rented a shack at 555 Main Street, near the present corner of Main Street and James Avenue.

1874: The paper moved to a new building on Main Street, across from St. Mary Avenue.

1882: Control of the &quot;Free Press&quot; was passed on to Clifford Sifton. The organization subsequently moved to a building on McDermot Avenue, where it would remain until 1900.

1900: The paper moved to a new address on McDermot Avenue at Albert Street.

1901: John Wesley Dafoe served as president, editor-in-chief, and editorial writer for the &quot;WFP&quot; until 1944.

1905: The newspaper moved to a four-storey building at Portage and Garry.

1913: The newspaper moved to 300 Carlton Street and would remain there for 78 years.

1920: The &quot;Free Press&quot; took its newsprint supplier before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for violating the War Measures Act during World War I. The newspaper won the case, known as &quot;Fort Frances Pulp and Paper v Manitoba Free Press&quot;, as the court determined that whether the state of national emergency continued after the war was a political matter for Parliament.

December 2, 1931: The paper was renamed the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;.

1991: The &quot;Free Press&quot; moved to its current location in the Inkster Industrial Park, a plant at 1355 Mountain Avenue.December 2001: The &quot;Free Press&quot; and its sister paper, &quot;Brandon Sun&quot;, were bought from Thomson Newspapers by FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership.

== Strike ==
In 2008, at noon on Thanksgiving Day (Monday, October 13), about 1,000 members of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union, representing editorial, advertising, circulation, and press staff, as well as newspaper carriers, launched a strike action. The strike ended 16 days later, when the union ratified the final offer on Tuesday, October 28. The contract was ratified by 67% of newspaper carriers, 75% of the pressmen, and 91% of the inside workers, including journalists. The recent five-year contract was negotiated, ratified, and signed in 2013, with no threat of a strike. Workers and managers negotiated directly with great success, without the need of a lawyer that previous contracts had required.

== Circulation ==
As of November 1, 2009, the &quot;WFP&quot; ceased publishing a regular Sunday edition. In its place, a Sunday-only tabloid called &quot;On 7&quot; was launched, but it has since been discontinued.

On March 27, 2011, the impending arrival of Metro in the Winnipeg market caused the Sunday newspaper to be retooled as a broadsheet format, &quot;Winnipeg Free Press SundayXtra&quot;. The Sunday edition is now available exclusively online.

According to figures via Canadian Newspaper Association, the &quot;Free Press&quot;&#x27; average weekday circulation for 2013 was 108,583, while on Saturdays it was 144,278. Because of the relatively small population of Manitoba, that meant that over 10% of the population could be receiving the paper and its advertisements. Like most Canadian daily newspapers, the &quot;Free Press&quot; has seen a decline in circulation, dropping its total by % to 106,473 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

:::::::::Daily average
As of 2023, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; media kit claims that 1.15 million users visit the newspaper&#x27;s network of sites each month, and that in Winnipeg, 439,000 adults read the publication in print or digital format each week.

<doc id="536397" wikidata="Q4592748" url="?curid=536397" title="1997 Red River flood">
<text>The Red River flood of 1997 was a major flood that occurred in April and May 1997 along the Red River of the North in Minnesota, North Dakota, and southern Manitoba. It was the most severe flood of the river since 1826. The flood reached throughout the Red River Valley, affecting the cities of Fargo and Winnipeg, but none so greatly as Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, where floodwaters reached more than inland. They inundated virtually everything in the twin communities. Total damages for the Red River region were US$3.5 billion. The flood was the result of abundant snowfall and extreme temperatures.

In Grand Forks, thousands of people, including Air Force personnel from Grand Forks Air Force Base, tried to prepare for the 1997 flood by building sandbag dikes. These dikes were constructed based on a 49-foot estimate of flooding set by the National Weather Service. The river crested at 54 feet in Grand Forks. Grand Forks mayor Pat Owens had to order the evacuation of more than 50,000 people, most of the population of the city, as a huge area was flooded. A large fire started in downtown Grand Forks, engulfing eleven buildings and sixty apartment units before being extinguished. Those affected by the flood in the U.S. received donations from across the nation, along with billions of dollars in federal aid. City officials and flood-forecasters were criticized for the difference in estimates and actual flood levels.

As a result of the 1997 flood and its extensive property losses, the United States and state governments made additional improvements to the flood protection system in North Dakota and Minnesota. A dike system was built on both sides of the river to protect the twin Forks cities. In the aftermath, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) worked with the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks to clear residential and business development from a large area of floodplain, because of the certainty of future regional floods, and also as the floodplain is intended to be a natural means to absorb floodwaters. They also redeveloped the floodplain along the river as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, including several parks, a Minnesota state campground recreation area, and a 20-mile biking and walking trail.

Flooding in Manitoba resulted in over $500 million in damages. The Red River Floodway, an artificial waterway completed in 1968 and nicknamed &quot;Duff&#x27;s Ditch&quot;, exceeded its capacity flow but managed to divert the floodwaters around Winnipeg which minimized damage. From 2005 to 2010, the province made substantial upgrades to inlet control structures and fire protection, increased elevation of existing dikes (including the Brunkild dike), and widened the floodway channel.

==Previous floods==
The Red River of the North has flooded repeatedly through the centuries. It is highly prone to spring flooding because of its northward flow, the nearly flat former lake bed of the valley, and ice formation on the river. As spring approaches, the snow melts from south to north in the same direction as the riverflow. At times high waters encounter ice on the river and back up, spreading out of the banks. The wide flatness of the terrain, formed from an ancient lake bed, and the low slope of the river also contribute to severe flooding in the region.

Serious floods occurred in 1948 and 1950. The 1950 flood reached a high of 30 ft (9.2 m) at Winnipeg and caused the largest evacuation in Canada&#x27;s history: an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people had to be evacuated. An estimated $606 million CAD (1997) of damage resulted. In the aftermath, the government of Manitoba and the Canadian federal government constructed flood safety measures.

The first known records of floods along the Red River were documented in the 1770s. Severe floods have occurred throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, including in 1979. Residents and officials incorrectly assumed that homes that were safe in 1979 would be beyond the reach of a future flood.

==Impacts==

===North Dakota and Minnesota===

The Red River forms the border between Minnesota and North Dakota. A few sets of &quot;sister cities&quot; developed along opposite sides of the river. Grand Forks, North Dakota and its counterpart East Grand Forks, Minnesota, were the pair most severely affected by the 1997 flood. Fargo, North Dakota/Moorhead, Minnesota (Fargo-Moorhead) and Wahpeton, North Dakota/Breckenridge, Minnesota also had severe flooding. Much of the flooding accumulated not only because of the rising river levels, but also from overland flooding, as meltwater did not drain away. Temporary dikes were erected along the riverfront and around the edges of towns, but were sometimes overwhelmed.

It was difficult for the cities to prepare for such an enormous flood. The National Weather Service (NWS) had forecast that the river would crest at 49 feet (14.9 m), which was its highest level during the 1979 flood. The cities had built dikes to this level, but the river continued to rise past it. Taken by surprise, the NWS did not upgrade its forecast until April 16, the day the river reached 49 feet.

The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive neighborhood of Grand Forks were the first to break, doing so early on April 18, as the river kept rising. Other dikes in the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area failed that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes. During this time, Grand Forks mayor Pat Owens ordered the evacuation of more than 50,000 people, much of the population of the city. This was the largest evacuation in the United States since the evacuation of residents in Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War.

Water reached areas more than two miles (3 km) inland from the Red River, requiring evacuation of all of East Grand Forks and 75% of Grand Forks. School was cancelled in both cities for the remainder of the term, as were classes at the University of North Dakota. All transportation was cut off between the two cities (and for many miles, the two states). East Grand Forks residents were evacuated to nearby Crookston, namely to the University of Minnesota Crookston. Residents of Grand Forks were given mandatory evacuation orders on April 18, and retreated to Grand Forks Air Force Base (residents stayed in airplane hangars, which were supplied with more than 3,000 cots). Many residents also evacuated to motels and homes in outlying communities.

The river crested at 54.35 feet (16.6 m) on April 21, and the river level did not fall below 49 feet (14.9 m) until April 26. Because water drained so slowly out of the most low-lying areas, some homeowners could not visit their damaged properties until May. By May 30, the Red River had receded below flood stages everywhere in North Dakota.

===Manitoba===

The province of Manitoba completed the Red River Floodway in 1968 after six years of construction, built permanent dikes in eight towns south of Winnipeg, and built clay dikes and diversion dams in the Winnipeg area. Other flood control structures completed later were the Portage Diversion and the Shellmouth Dam on the Assiniboine River. Even with these flood protection measures, in 1997 the province had a flood cresting at . It caused 28,000 people to be evacuated and $500 million CAD in damage to property and infrastructure.

The 1997 flood was a 100-year flood. It came close to overwhelming Winnipeg&#x27;s existing flood protection system. At the time, the Winnipeg Floodway was designed to protect against a flow of , but the 1997 flow was .

To compensate, the province broke operational rules for the Floodway, as defined in legislation, during the night of April 30 / May 1, to prevent waters in Winnipeg from rising above the designed limit of above the &quot;James Avenue datum&quot;, but causing additional flooding upriver. Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson, announcing that the design limit had been reached, misinterpreted this as good news that the flooding had peaked. City sand-bagging stopped, and national reporters left the city, but the water continued to rise inside and outside of the city until the peak late on May 3 / early on May 4. The city officials have said that the peak occurred on May 1; scientific reports record a peak on May 3/4.

Towns upriver of Winnipeg, forewarned by footage of buildings in Grand Forks burning and covered in meters of water, built ring dikes to protect their homes and properties. The province of Manitoba called in the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the provincial Department of Natural Resources. Many people chose to evacuate, including residents from Morris, who had only two days notice to evacuate to Winnipeg. Thousands of volunteers helped to build sandbag dikes around homes and property. An emergency long dike, later called the Brunkild Z-dike, was constructed in a matter of days when officials realized that overland flooding threatened the city of Winnipeg. It cost $10 million (CAD).

Almost all of the ring dikes around the towns held, except for that at Ste. Agathe. The town&#x27;s dike system was prepared for the river approaching from the south, but the river had spread widely and floodwaters swamped the town from the west. At the flood&#x27;s peak in Canada on May 4, the Red River occupied an area of 1,840 km2 (710 mi2) with more than 2,560 km2 (990 mi2) of land underwater, which earned it the nickname &quot;Red Sea.&quot;

While the flooding was still underway, the federal Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien called a snap election. Several of the party&#x27;s MPs from the province, including Reg Alcock, requested a delay until the flooding was under control. When Chrétien let the election go ahead as originally planned, Alcock transformed his campaign office into a volunteer relief centre, spending his time in relief efforts instead of campaigning, and won re-election.

==Aftermath==
In July, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and United States President Bill Clinton appointed the International Red River Basin Task Force, comprising members from both countries. The task force&#x27;s purpose was to find ways to improve flood forecasting.

The province of Manitoba asked the International Joint Commission (IJC) to provide a report on the flood event and to recommend measures to ensure further flood protection for the city of Winnipeg. Largely as a result of this study, the province widened the floodway between 2004 and 2010.

== Societal response ==
Following the flood, Catastroffiti, a form of graffiti related to natural disasters, started to appear as affected residents gutted their houses, placing damaged materials on the berms. At first, this graffiti was placed on trashed appliances to prevent theft and resale, but soon expanded in medium and purpose. The graffiti done mostly in spray paint (also mud) started to not only be a precaution, but a dialogue of emotions related to the effects of the flood. Post-flood emotions driving this largely consisted of frustration with the National Weather Service after it predicted a flood crest about five feet less than the actual. As this developed, catastroffiti was appearing on not just household appliances, but also houses, garages, and signs.

<text>Captain Silas Talbot (January 11, 1751June 30, 1813) was an American military officer and slave trader. He served in the Continental Army and Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War, and is most famous for commanding from 1799 to 1801. Talbot was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati&#x27;s New York branch.

==Early life==

Talbot was born in Dighton, Massachusetts, on January 11, 1751, and came from a large farming family. At twelve, he took to seafaring, serving as a cabin boy in a coasting vessel. Talbot&#x27;s performance proved outstanding, and by 1772 had saved up enough money to buy property on Weybosset Street in Providence, Rhode Island, and build a stone home, having learned the trade of stone masonry earlier in life. He enslaved people.

==Military service==

===American Revolutionary War===
On June 28, 1775, Talbot received the commission of a captain in the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment. After participating in the siege of Boston, Talbot and the Continental Army began their march to New York. En route, they stopped at New London, Connecticut, whose port had just received Esek Hopkins, who had just landed from a naval expedition to the Bahamas. After learning that Hopkins would petition General George Washington for 200 volunteers needed to assist his squadron in reaching Providence, Talbot volunteered his services in this effort.

After Talbot made his way back to New York, where he was aiding in the transportation of troops, he obtained command of a fire ship and attempted to use it to set fire to the Royal Navy warship HMS &quot;Asia&quot; on September 14, 1776. The attempt failed, but the daring it displayed, and that Talbot was severely burned during the effort, won him a promotion to major on October 10, 1777, retroactive to September 1.

After suffering a severe wound at Fort Mifflin while fighting to defend Philadelphia, on October 23, 1777, Talbot returned to active service in the summer of 1778 and fought in the Battle of Rhode Island on August 28, 1778.

As commander of the galley (which he had captured from the Royal Navy in the Sakonnet River on October 28, 1778), and later , both under the Army, he cruised against Loyalist vessels that were harassing American trade between Long Island and Nantucket and made prisoners of many of them. On November 14, 1778, the Continental Congress passed a resolution that recognized his success in capturing &quot;Pigot&quot; and promoted him to lieutenant colonel on the same date. In October of the same year, the Rhode Island General Assembly voted to present Talbot with a &quot;genteel silver-hilted sword&quot; for the same action. Silversmith John Gladding Gibbs of Providence made the sword.

====Continental Navy====
Because of his success fighting afloat for the Army, Congress commissioned Talbot as a captain in the Continental Navy on September 17, 1779. However, since Congress had no suitable warship to entrust to him, Talbot put to sea in command of the privateer &quot;General Washington&quot;. He took one prize in it but soon ran into a Royal Navy fleet off New York. After a chase, he struck his colors to &quot;Culloden&quot;, a 74-gun British ship-of-the-line and remained a prisoner of war until exchanged for a British officer in December 1781.

====Slave trader====

Talbot was not only an enslaver, but from 1783 onward, was the partial owner of two slave ships, the sloop &quot;Peggy&quot; and ninety-ton brigantine &quot;Industry&quot;. Both vessels transported enslaved people from the Guinea region to Charleston. On one 1786 voyage of the &quot;Industry&quot;, Talbot was notified by his solicitors, Murray, Mumford, and Bower, on 9 September 1786 of a significant financial loss: &quot;We hear about one hundred &amp; eighty Slaves off the coast of Guinea, near half of which died before the brig arrived in Charleston where she is now.&quot; As late 1801 Talbot was still trying to collect some compensation from his business partners to offset his financial losses from the slave trade.

===Postwar===
After the Revolutionary War, Talbot settled in Johnstown, the seat of Fulton County, New York, where he purchased the former manor house and estate of William Johnson, the city founder. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1792 and 1792 to 1793.

===Congress and United States Navy===
In January 1793, Talbot was elected as a Federalist from New York to the 3rd United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1793, to approximately June 5, 1794, when President George Washington chose him third in a list of six captains of the newly established United States Navy. During his time in Congress, he was one of nine representatives to vote against the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. He was ordered to superintend the construction of the frigate at New York. On April 20, 1796, the construction of &quot;President&quot; was suspended, and Talbot was discharged from the Navy.

With the outbreak of the Quasi-War with the French First Republic, Talbot was re-commissioned as a captain in the United States Navy on May 11, 1798. He served as commander of from June 5, 1799, until September 8, 1801, sailing it to the West Indies, where he protected American commerce from French privateers during the Quasi-War. He commanded the Santo Domingo Station in 1799 and 1800 and was commended by the Secretary of the Navy for protecting American commerce and for laying the foundation of a permanent trade with that country. Talbot was reportedly wounded 13 times and carried 5 bullets in his body.

Talbot resigned from the Navy on September 21, 1801, and died in New York City on June 30, 1813. He was buried in Trinity Churchyard in lower Manhattan.

==Legacy and honors==
The first (Torpedo Boat No. 15) was named for Lt. John Gunnell Talbot, no relation to Silas Talbot; the second and third Talbots (&quot;Talbot&quot; (DD-114/APD 7) and &quot;Talbot&quot; (DEG/FFG-4), respectively) were named for Captain Silas Talbot.

Talbot was an original member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati.

Battery Talbot (1899–1919), named for Silas Talbot in G.O. 30, March 19, 1902, was a reinforced concrete Endicott Period 4.72-inch coastal gun battery on Fort Adams, Newport County, Rhode Island. Both of the original guns from this battery survive. One is on display at Equality Park in Newport, and the other is at Fort Moultrie National Park near Charleston, South Carolina.

There is a cenotaph in honor of Captain Talbot in the Dighton Congregational Church cemetery in his hometown of Dighton, Massachusetts.

<text>Local authority Accommodation is the name given to a form of Public housing provided in Ireland by various County Councils and City Corporations along with Urban District Councils. In Dublin, the most notable and visible example of local authority accommodation is the Ballymun Flats near Dublin Airport.

Estates of houses have been built around the country at various stages, typically to strict standards.

In 2006, the Irish Government budgeted just over €1 billion for social housing needs.

<doc id="536448" wikidata="Q170169" url="?curid=536448" title="Hannover Airport">
<text>Hannover Airport is the international airport of Hanover, capital of the German state of Lower Saxony. The ninth largest airport in Germany, it is situated on in Langenhagen, north of the centre of Hanover. The airport has flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations, and serves as a base for Eurowings, Corendon Airlines Europe and TUI fly Deutschland.

==History==
===Early years===

Hannover Airport opened in Langenhagen in 1952, replacing an airfield situated within the 1952 city limits of Hanover. In 1973 two modern passenger terminals opened as terminals A and B that, , are still in service. Known for their compact design, Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow was modelled after them.

In the 1990s, trials of intercontinental services to the United States and Canada were stopped due to low passenger numbers.

Terminal C, the largest of the three passenger terminals, was opened in 1998 to handle more passengers, adding 8 more boarding gates and 3 bus departure gates. Up to 33 aircraft can be handled simultaneously, of which 20 can use aircraft stands equipped with a jet bridge. All three terminals are capable of handling a Boeing 747.

From 1957 to 1990, the airport hosted the &quot;Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung&quot;, Germany&#x27;s largest air show. After a fatal accident in 1988, when a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter hit a jet bridge with its rotor, and after German Reunification two years later, the air show moved to Berlin in 1992.

===Development since the 2000s===
An S-Bahn connection was established between the airport and Hamelin via Hanover central station in 2000. This replaced the airport&#x27;s shuttle bus service. While the bus service ran more frequently than the S-Bahn (it ran every 20 minutes), it also took longer to travel between the airport and central station. The train service was extended to Paderborn in 2003.

TUIfly, which maintains a base at Hannover Airport, reduced services heavily in 2008 and 2009, and late in 2009 passed all of its non-traditional holiday routes to now defunct Air Berlin. In 2010, Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings made Hannover their sixth base in Germany, launching 16 new routes. In March 2017, Air Berlin ceased all of its services and operations at Hannover, shortly shutting down fully.

Hannover Airport has struggled to generate increased demand in recent years, possibly due to not being able to attract Europe&#x27;s low-cost carriers to the airport. In addition, new routes from established legacy carriers with their hubs were not able to sustain themselves, as seen with Aer Lingus, airBaltic, Finnair, Brussels Airlines, Iberia, LOT Polish Airlines, and TAP Air Portugal. Traffic grew satisfactorily during the late 1990s and consolidated afterwards. In both 2007 and 2008, traffic was down less than 1%, but in 2009 it fell by almost 12%. Hannover Airport is one of the very few airports in Germany that are open 24 hours a day, but only a few passenger and cargo flights operate at Hannover between 11pm and 4am.

In September 2006 the general aviation terminal, located near the middle runway, was renamed to &quot;Karl Jatho Terminal&quot; in honour of Hanoverian aviation pioneer Karl Jatho.

==Terminals==
The landside areas of Hannover Airport&#x27;s three passenger terminals A, B, and C (each with shops, restaurants, and travel agents) are interconnected, but each terminal also has its own, separate, airside area with further facilities. Terminals A and B each have six boarding gates equipped with jet bridges, while terminal C has eight of them. Additional bus gates are available in each concourse. Terminal A underwent a major refurbishment from April 2013, reopening on 9 July 2014.

A rebuilt hangar to the east of the main terminal is used exclusively as terminal D by the Royal Air Force to transport British troops to and from northern Germany.

<doc id="536461" wikidata="Q3653936" url="?curid=536461" title="NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament">
<text>The NCAA Division II men&#x27;s basketball tournament (officially styled by the NCAA as a &quot;Championship&quot; instead of a &quot;Tournament&quot;) is an annual championship tournament for colleges and universities that are members of NCAA Division II, a grouping of schools in the United States (plus one school in Canada) that are generally smaller than the higher-profile institutions grouped in Division I. The tournament, originally known as the NCAA College Division Basketball Championship, was established in 1957, immediately after the NCAA subdivided its member schools into the University Division (today&#x27;s Division I) and College Division. It became the Division II championship in 1974, when the NCAA split the College Division into the limited-scholarship Division II and the non-scholarship Division III, and added the &quot;Men&#x27;s&quot; designation in 1982 when the NCAA began sponsoring a Division II women&#x27;s championship.

Like all other NCAA basketball divisions for men and women, the champion is decided in a single-elimination tournament. The Division II tournament normally involves 64 teams. The Division II tournaments for men and women differ in a major respect from those in Divisions I and III. The finals of both Division II tournaments consist of eight teams, instead of the four in the other two divisions. The eight survivors of regional play meet in the Elite Eight at a predetermined site.

==Qualification==
A total of 64 bids are normally available for each tournament: 23 automatic bids (awarded to the champion of each Division II all-sports conference) and 41 at-large bids. Due to COVID-19 issues, the 2020 tournament was canceled, and the 2021 tournament was reduced to 48 teams when nine all-sports conferences chose not to compete in men&#x27;s basketball in 2020–21.

The bids are allocated evenly among the eight NCAA-designated regions (Atlantic, Central, East, Midwest, South, South Central, Southeast, and West), all but one of which contain three of the 23 Division II conferences that sponsor men&#x27;s basketball. The South Central region contains only two conferences. Each regional tournament involves an appropriate number of automatic qualifiers (teams that won their respective conference tournaments), with the remaining participants entering via at-large bids (which are awarded regardless of conference affiliation).

===Conference tournaments===
Schools in &quot;italics&quot; are, as of the upcoming 2024–25 Division II basketball season, no longer members of that specific conference.

CBS Sports holds rights to the semi-final and final rounds of the Division II tournament, with the semi-final games broadcast on CBS Sports Network and the final on CBS (covered as part of the &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot; package). In 2015, CBS Sports reached a long-term deal to continue broadcasting the Division II men&#x27;s semi-final on CBS Sports Network through 2024.

<doc id="536463" wikidata="Q5233188" url="?curid=536463" title="David E. Kendall">
<text>David Evan Kendall (born May 2, 1944) is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams &amp; Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters.

He is known for his roles in the &quot;Coker v. Georgia, Gilmore v. Utah,&quot; and other death penalty cases; in the copyright and contract cases of &quot;MGM Studios v. Grokster&quot; and &quot;Tasini v. AOL&quot;; as well as in various First Amendment cases, including for &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; In addition, he is known for having advised President Bill Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal, and representing him during his impeachment trial. He served as defense attorney in the successful defense of retired General David Petraeus, and currently represents the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, including in the matter of her use of a private email server while serving as U.S. Secretary of State.

==Early life and education==
Kendall was born at Camp Atterbury near Edinburgh, Indiana, on May 2, 1944, and grew up in Sheridan, Indiana. While a student at Wabash College, Kendall helped register black voters in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer of 1964, which led to his arrest on multiple occasions.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Mississippi, he was the roommate of murdered civil rights worker Andrew Goodman during the last week of Goodman&#x27;s life.

Kendall obtained his Bachelor of Arts in history from Wabash College in 1966 (summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa). As a Rhodes Scholar, Kendall earned a degree at Worcester College, Oxford in 1968, elevated to a Master of Arts (Oxon) per tradition. He earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1971, where he met Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.

==Career==
===Clerkship and NAACP===
Following a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, Kendall served at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund from 1973 to 1978, focusing on criminal defense practice, and handling high-profile death penalty cases including &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot; and the death penalty appeals of John Spenkelink.
===Professional practice===
He joined Williams &amp; Connolly LLP, a Washington, D.C. law firm, in 1978 and became a partner there in 1981. He currently works on diverse matters such as intellectual property, criminal investigations, and the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Clinton Foundation. As he states in his profile at his law firm&#x27;s web page, he &quot;has appeared in trial courts in 23 states and has argued appeals in six federal courts of appeal, seven state supreme courts, and the Supreme Court of the United States.&quot; He has briefed and argued numerous important criminal cases before the Supreme Court on &quot;pro bono&quot; assignments.

====Representation of corporate clients====

His notable clients have included the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; (in First Amendment cases), Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos (in a naming rights case), the Motion Picture Association of America (in their copyright and intellectual property case against Napster and Grokster), as well as AOL and other clients. He successfully defended AOL in a class-action suit, Tasini v. AOL, wherein contributors to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, who were not paid for their work, claimed that they were entitled to compensation when AOL purchased &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

====Representation of President Clinton====
Kendall began representing President Clinton in November 1993 in an investigation related to the Arkansas savings and loan, Whitewater Development Company, Inc. As the investigation expanded, Kendall went on to represent Clinton during the 1998–99 impeachment proceedings, and continues to represent the Clintons in miscellaneous civil matters.

Kendall advised President Clinton during the grand jury appearance that led to the discovery of Clinton&#x27;s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; notes that the Washington legal establishment was critical of Kendall&#x27;s advising Clinton to pursue the &quot;legalistic argument&quot; that Clinton&#x27;s sexual encounters with the intern did not constitute a sexual relationship, &quot;for not having Clinton come forward earlier with the truth about Lewinsky, for letting him testify before the grand jury [and digging] himself into even deeper… trouble with his… answers, and for inflaming [Independent Counsel Kenneth] Starr with repeated attacks;&quot; he is credited, however, for the fruit born from battles with Starr, including the August 1998 ruling of Judge Norma Holloway Johnson &quot;accusing Starr of violating grand jury secrecy rules,&quot; and for improving the public&#x27;s perception of his client&#x27;s case by referring to the Starr Report as &quot;an extravagant effort to find a case where there is none.&quot;

====Representation of General David Petraeus====
Kendall served as counsel to retired General David Petraeus, over his mishandling and dissemination of classified materials (to his biographer, Paula Broadwell), where Kendall saw felony charges reduced and possible prison time avoided in Petraeus&#x27;s misdemeanor guilty plea and sentence of two years of probation and a $100,000 fine.

====Representation of Secretary Clinton====
Kendall began representing former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, before her State Department appointment, in November 1993, over matters regarding an Arkansas savings and loan, Whitewater Development Company, Inc., and represented her interests throughout her husband&#x27;s legal challenges during his presidency, including in bar counsel investigations and civil litigation.

Kendall currently represents the former Secretary in the matter of her use of a private e-mail server while serving as United States Secretary of State, as well as in various civil matters.

==Published works==

* &quot;ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Fair Trial and Free Press&quot; (1991), as a part of the ABA Task Force

==Honors==

Kendall was recognized with a Doctor of Laws, &quot;honoris causa&quot; (honorary), degree from his alma mater, Wabash College, on May 16, 2010.

<text>Christina Joan Clark (born October 29, 1965) is a Canadian politician who served as the 35th premier of British Columbia from 2011 to 2017. Clark was the second woman to be premier of BC, after Rita Johnston in 1991, and the first female premier in Canada to lead her party to a plurality of seats in two consecutive general elections.

A member of the British Columbia Liberal Party, Clark was a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1996 to 2005 and was deputy premier from 2001 to 2005 during the first term of Gordon Campbell&#x27;s government. She left politics in 2005, and became the host of an afternoon radio talk show. After Campbell&#x27;s resignation, Clark won the 2011 leadership election, becoming premier. She re-entered the legislature after winning a by-election on May 11 in Vancouver-Point Grey, the seat left vacant by Campbell. The Liberals were re-elected in the 2013 provincial election in an upset victory. In the 2017 provincial election, the Liberals were reduced to 43 seats—one short of a majority. Following a confidence and supply agreement between the NDP and Green Party, Clark&#x27;s minority government was defeated 44–42, and NDP leader John Horgan succeeded her as the premier on July 18. Clark subsequently announced that she was resigning as Liberal leader effective August 4 and leaving provincial politics.

Following Justin Trudeau&#x27;s announcement that he would resign as prime minister and as leader of the federal Liberal Party, Clark was considered a potential candidate to succeed him. On January 14, 2025, she declined to enter the race, citing her lack of French fluency and the short timescale of the race.

==Early life and family==
Clark was born on October 29, 1965, in Burnaby, British Columbia, the daughter of Mavis Audrey (née Bain) and Jim Clark. Her father was a teacher and a three-time candidate for the legislative assembly, and her mother, who was born in Glasgow, Scotland, was a marriage and family therapist in Vancouver. On June 8, 2016, Clark recounted that, as a 13-year-old girl on her way to work at her first job, she was forcibly grabbed and pulled into some bushes; she also shared that she had been subject to other sexual offences throughout her life and that she had not felt able to share this until a campus sexual assault bill proposed by the Green Party came up.

Clark graduated from Burnaby South Senior Secondary before attending Simon Fraser University (SFU), the Sorbonne in France and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland to major in political science and religious studies. She did not graduate from any post-secondary institution.

In 2001, Clark gave birth to her only child, Hamish Marissen-Clark, with then husband Mark Marissen. Clark was the second woman in Canadian history to give birth to a child while serving as a cabinet minister, after Pauline Marois, then a Quebec provincial minister, in 1985.

==Early political career==

===Opposition===
Clark was first elected to the legislative assembly in the 1996 election, representing the riding of Port Moody-Burnaby Mountain. During the next five years, she served as the Official Opposition critic for the environment, children and families and for the public service. She also served as the campaign co-chair for the BC Liberals during the 2001 election, in which the party won 77 of 79 seats in the legislative assembly.

===Government===
Following the BC Liberal Party&#x27;s election victory in 2001, Premier Gordon Campbell appointed Clark Minister of Education and Deputy Premier. She brought in a number of changes that were claimed to increase accountability, strengthen parental power in the decision-making process, and provide parents greater choice and flexibility in the school system. These changes were unpopular amongst teachers, school board members, opposition politicians, and union officials who argued that the decision not to fund the pay increases agreed to by the government resulted in funding gaps. The changes made were challenged by the BC Teacher&#x27;s Federation, and were later found to be unconstitutional.

As Education Minister, Clark sought to increase the independence of the BC College of Teachers against heavy opposition from the British Columbia Teachers&#x27; Federation. In 2002, the BC Liberals and Education Minister Christy Clark introduced Bills 27 &amp; 28 forcing teachers back to work and banning collective bargaining. In 2011, the BC Supreme Court found Minister Clark&#x27;s decision to do so unconstitutional.
Clark was deputy premier at the time of the privatization of BC Rail and resulting scandal. Clark was also the co-chair of the 2001 Liberal campaign, which included a platform that specifically promised not to sell BC Rail. In 2009, Michael Bolton, defence attorney in the Basi-Virk trial, alleged that Clark had participated in the scandal by providing government information to lobbyist Erik Bornmann. These allegations were never proven or tested in court. Dave Basi and Bob Virk, Liberal Party insiders were charged for accepting benefits from one of the bidders. Clark has rebuffed talk of her links to the scandal as &quot;smear tactics&quot;. At the time of the raids and associated warrants, her then-husband Mark Marissen was visited at home by the RCMP. Her husband was also not under investigation, and was told that he might have been the &quot;innocent recipient&quot; of documents then in his possession.

In 2004, Clark was appointed Minister of Children and Family Development after Minister Gordon Hogg was forced to resign. On September 17, 2004, Clark quit provincial politics and did not seek re-election in the 2005 provincial election. She declared she wanted to spend more time with her three-year-old son.

===Campaign for mayor of Vancouver===
On August 31, 2005, Clark announced that she would seek the nomination of the Non-Partisan Association (NPA) to run for mayor in the Vancouver Civic Elections against local councillor Sam Sullivan. On September 24, 2005, she lost the NPA&#x27;s mayoral nomination to Sullivan by 69 votes out of 2,100 cast. Sullivan was subsequently elected Mayor of Vancouver and in 2013 was elected a Liberal MLA while Clark was premier.

==Radio show and columnist==

Clark hosted &quot;The Christy Clark Show,&quot; airing weekdays on CKNW 980 AM in Vancouver from August 27, 2007, until the time of her decision to enter the BC Liberal leadership election in December 2010. Clark also served as a weekly columnist for the &quot;Vancouver Province&quot; and the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; newspapers during the 2005 provincial election and an election analyst for Global BC and CTV News Channel during the 2006 federal election.

==Leadership campaign==


On December 8, 2010, Clark officially announced her intent to seek the leadership of the BC Liberal Party. While Clark had long been touted as a potential successor to BC Premier Gordon Campbell, she often claimed she had no further interest in a political career. Public polling conducted prior to and after the announcement of her candidacy showed that Clark was the frontrunner to succeed Campbell as leader of the BC Liberals and premier. Clark launched her leadership bid saying she wanted a &quot;family-first agenda&quot;. During the campaign she tried to cast herself as an outsider from the current caucus, and as the only candidate who could provide the change voters were looking for. Clark&#x27;s policy proposals included observing a provincial Family Day in February, establishing an Office of the Municipal Auditor General to monitor local government taxation, and to provide a more open government by holding 12 town hall meetings a year to hear from residents. Regarding the controversial Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), she campaigned early on to cancel the referendum scheduled for September 2011. She suggested a free vote in the legislature by MLAs, believing the HST referendum has little chance of success. &quot;Let our MLAs do their jobs and let our MLAs vote down the HST. Do it by March 31 and get it over with and get on with life in BC&quot;, Clark told a crowd of about 40 in Pitt Meadows. However, she eventually decided to continue with the planned referendum.

Despite her perceived frontrunner status, backbench MLA Harry Bloy was the only sitting member of BC Liberal caucus to endorse her candidacy for leader. The majority of the caucus supported the campaigns of Kevin Falcon and George Abbott, who were each endorsed by 19 MLAs. While many saw Clark as the best hope for the party there were fears that Clark&#x27;s past background with the federal Liberal Party could fracture the party. The BC Liberals are not affiliated with any party at the federal level and is considered a &quot;free-enterprise coalition&quot; made up of both federal Conservatives and Liberals, and there were fears that right-wing supporters would move to the British Columbia Conservative Party which had started to make a comeback in the province after decades of dormancy.

Her campaign faced questions regarding her involvement in the sale of BC Rail due to her cabinet position and family connection to people &quot;mentioned prominently in court documents, including search warrants&quot;, with opposition members stating that she &quot;wants to shut down the public&#x27;s questions about the scandal&quot;. It was in the wake of the controversial Basi-Virk guilty pleas that ended the trial proceedings that she declared her candidacy for the party leadership on her radio show. Clark had called for more questions to be answered about BC Rail, but since then has said that there is no need for a public inquiry, as have the other Liberal Party leadership contenders.

At the leadership convention held on February 26, 2011, Clark was elected leader of the BC Liberals on the third ballot, over former Health Minister Kevin Falcon. She won 52 per cent of the vote, compared to 48 per cent for Falcon.

==Premier of British Columbia (2011–2017)==

Clark was sworn in as premier of British Columbia on March 14, 2011, and unveiled a new smaller cabinet on the same day. At the time of her swearing in, she did not hold a seat in the legislature. Clark ran in former Premier Gordon Campbell&#x27;s riding of Vancouver-Point Grey and defeated NDP candidate David Eby by 595 votes. Her win marked the first time that a governing party won a by-election in 30 years.

After Clark became premier, the Liberal Party saw a bounce in support and lead in opinion polls, after falling behind the Official Opposition NDP under Campbell. However, the increase in support was short lived and within months the party had fallen behind the NDP once again. Several polls eventually showed a statistical tie between the Liberals and the minor Conservative Party, with support for each party in the low twenties, while support for the NDP was in the high 40s. Internal problems within the Conservative Party towards the end of 2012 saw the party bleed support to the Liberals.

In the summer of 2012, several high-profile caucus members, including the Ministers of Education and Finance, announced they wouldn&#x27;t seek re-election. Though Premier Clark suggested she &quot;expected&quot; the resignations, the news shook her government. The Quick Wins ethnic outreach scandal, where the Liberals used government resources as part of their partisan ethnic outreach activities, generated public outcry.

During her premiership, she was accused of conflict of interest by MLA and former BC Liberal cabinet minister John van Dongen in relation to the sale of BC Rail during her service as a cabinet minister in the Campbell government. In April 2013, BC&#x27;s Conflict of Interest Commissioner released a decision that Clark had been in neither a real nor apparent conflict of interest.

In June 2022 the Cullen Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia final report stated: &quot;In 2015... the premier learned that casinos conducted and managed by a Crown corporation and regulated by government were reporting transactions involving enormous quantities of cash as suspicious. Despite receiving this information, Ms. Clark failed to determine whether these funds were being accepted by the casinos (and in turn contributing to the revenue of the Province) and failed to ensure such funds were not accepted.&quot;

===2013 re-election===
As the 2013 general election approached, polls showed that Clark was one of the least popular premiers in Canada. Two months prior to the election, The Province newspaper&#x27;s front page featured a column by pundit Michael Smyth with the banner headline: &quot;If This Man Kicked A Dog He Would Still Win The Election.&quot; However, Clark ran a &quot;tightly-focused campaign that centred on jobs, LNG, and a &#x27;debt free&#x27; BC&quot; During the leaders&#x27; televised debate, Clark attacked NDP leader Adrian Dix for his &quot;waffling position on the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion&quot;. Dix&#x27;s strategy of taking the &quot;high road&quot;, similar to Jack Layton&#x27;s successful approach in the 2011 federal election, left him vulnerable to &quot;relentless [BC] Liberal attacks on the economic competence of his party&quot;.

Clark defied pollster predictions by leading her party to victory, its fourth consecutive mandate but her first, in the May 13, 2013, provincial election reversing a 20-point lead held by the BC NDP at the beginning of the campaign. However, she suffered personal defeat in Vancouver-Point Grey, losing her seat to NDP candidate David Eby by a margin of 785 votes. According to parliamentary precedent, she was entitled to remain premier, but had to win a by-election in order to sit in the Legislative Assembly. She did not rule out running in a riding outside the Lower Mainland in order to get back into the chamber, telling &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that she believed one reason she lost her own riding was that she was devoting so much time to serving the entire province.

On June 4, Clark announced she would run in a by-election for the safe Liberal seat of Westside-Kelowna to re-enter the Legislative Assembly. The incumbent MLA, government whip Ben Stewart, resigned in Clark&#x27;s favour. Clark won the by-election on July 10, 2013, taking more than 60 per cent of the vote over NDP candidate Carole Gordon.

===Economic policy===

Under Clark the party charted a more centrist outlook while continuing its recent tradition of being a coalition of federal Liberal and federal Conservative supporters. She immediately raised the minimum wage from $8/hour to $10.25/hour and introduced a province-wide Family Day similar to Ontario&#x27;s. Clark became premier during the aftermath of the 2008–09 recession, and continued to hold the line on government spending, introducing two deficit budgets before a balanced one for the 2013–14 fiscal year, which included a tax hike on high-income British Columbians.

===Energy policy===

Clark&#x27;s government sought to take advantage of BC&#x27;s liquified natural gas (LNG) reserves, positioning the budding LNG industry as a major economic development opportunity over the next decade. While the final years of Gordon Campbell&#x27;s administration had seen far-reaching and progressive environmental legislation enacted, Clark was more measured in her approach to environmental policy. While continuing with BC&#x27;s first-in-North-America carbon tax, she promised to freeze the rate during the 2013 election and her LNG development aspirations seemed to contradict greenhouse gas emissions targets set by the Campbell government in 2007. She also announced in 2012 that any future pipeline that crosses BC would have to meet five conditions that included environmental requirements and Aboriginal consultation. Controversially, she indicated that one of her five conditions would be that BC receives its &quot;fair share&quot; of any revenues that accrue from increased pipeline and tanker traffic. This has put her in direct conflict with the province of Alberta, who sought increased market access for its bitumen through BC ports, yet adamantly refuse any arrangement which would see BC receive any royalties.

===Race relations===
In May 2014, Clark gave a formal apology for 160 historical racist and discriminatory policies imposed against Chinese-Canadians:

While the governments which passed these laws and policies acted in a manner that [was] lawful at the time, today this racist discrimination is seen by British Columbians — represented by all members of the legislative assembly — as unacceptable and intolerable. The entire legislative assembly acknowledges the perseverance of Chinese Canadians that was demonstrated with grace and dignity throughout our history while being oppressed by unfair and discriminatory historical laws.

In October 2014 the British Columbia government exonerated First Nations leaders who had been sentenced to be hanged in the Chilcotin War by Judge Begbie in 1864. Clark stated, &quot;We confirm without reservation that these six Tsilhqot&#x27;in chiefs are fully exonerated for any crime or wrongdoing.&quot;

=== 2017 election ===

On September 14, 2016, the BC Liberal Party named executive director Laura Miller as the party&#x27;s campaign director for the 2017 provincial election. At the time, Miller was facing charges in Ontario for allegedly deleting emails while in service with the Dalton McGuinty provincial Liberal government, though she was later found not guilty.

The BC Liberals planned a bridge to replace the Massey Tunnel. The Liberal government instituted taxes for Metro Vancouver property purchases by foreign buyers (&quot;Foreign Buyers Tax&quot;), and implemented a program of no-interest loans from the government to first-time home buyers.

Clark campaigned on her government&#x27;s economic track record. However, the opposition NDP and Greens criticized her inaction on &quot;lax political fundraising laws&quot; and portrayed her as &quot;beholden to big money interests&quot;, attacking the BC Liberals on &quot;housing, transit and other affordability issues&quot;. While BC enjoyed strong economic growth and her government had five balanced budgets, BC was also &quot;becoming behind the country’s most unequal province, socio-economically speaking, thanks to 37 per cent cuts to income tax levies, tightened rules for welfare eligibility, cuts to child-care subsidies, reductions in support for women’s centres and the doubling of post-secondary tuitions&quot;. Clark also faced &quot;relentless criticism over bottomless corporate and foreign donations that gave her party a four-fold advantage over the NDP, such that even &quot;The New York Times&quot; labelled BC the &quot;wild west&quot; of political cash and the province&#x27;s elections agency referred its investigation to the RCMP&quot;. During her leadership of the BC Liberals, she had shifted them &quot;so far to the right [with regards to environmental and energy policies] to appease its ascendant federal Conservative flank it is now unrecognizable from the centrist party led by Gordon Campbell, her predecessor&quot;. The combination of these controversies caused Liberal support in Metro Vancouver to collapse, as an estimated 100,000 voters switched from the Liberals to the Greens.

Furthermore, a video of Clark having a run-in with a disgruntled voter inside a North Vancouver grocery store went viral with the hashtag #IamLinda.

In the 2017 general election, the BC Liberals held the largest number of seats (43), ahead of the NDP (41) and Greens (3), but they were one seat short of forming a majority in the Legislative Assembly.

===Return to the opposition and retirement===
After the election the Liberals entered negotiations with the Green Party of British Columbia, which held the balance of power in the legislative assembly; however, on May 29, 2017, the Greens instead reached a confidence and supply agreement with the official opposition NDP, which on paper allowed the NDP to form a minority government by one seat. Although NDP leader John Horgan and Green Party leader Andrew Weaver did not have a close personal relationship, Weaver picked the NDP over the Liberals, citing Clark&#x27;s dismantling of the province&#x27;s climate change plan (that Weaver worked with then-Premier Gordon Campbell to develop prior to entering politics) plus support for energy companies and pipelines. Furthermore, Horgan reached out to Weaver personally while Clark did not.

Nonetheless, the Liberal government did not relinquish power yet, and Clark&#x27;s new cabinet was sworn in on June 8. Clark subsequently recalled the legislative assembly to test its confidence in her government, with a speech from the throne that included billions of dollars in new funding and key policies supported by the NDP and Greens. Critics saw the throne speech as a cynical way for the Clark government to &quot;desperately cling to power in selling out her party and its supporters in offering a de facto &#x27;renewed&#x27; policy platform that stands in stark contrast to the last several years of the BC Liberal government and the still-warm corpse of the party’s election platform&quot;. One critic saw Clark&#x27;s gambit as unprincipled &quot;because it’s disrespectful to voters who rely on parties as aggregators of ideas that lead to policies they like&quot;, noted that the 30 pledges were absent from the Liberals&#x27; election platform, but also the &quot;dramatic conversion to an NDP/Green-light version of her party appear like an over-correction, given the modest shift in support&quot; as the Liberals lost 4 percentage points of popular vote in the general election. However, both the NDP and Green Party leaders said they would not consider legislation by the Liberal minority government, and none of their MLAs broke ranks to support the throne speech.

On June 29, Clark&#x27;s minority government was defeated 44–42 after Horgan introduced a no-confidence motion as an amendment to the throne speech. Clark then asked Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon for a new election, contending that an NDP minority government would be unstable due to the need for one of the NDP&#x27;s members to become speaker. Clark argued that an NDP speaker would frequently be forced to use their casting vote to break 43–43 ties. Guichon did not agree and refused to dissolve the legislature. Clark then resigned as premier, and Guichon invited Horgan to form a minority government, which took office on July 18.

On July 28, Clark announced that she would resign as Liberal Party Leader and exit from politics, effective August 4, 2017.

== Post-premiership==
Clark considered running in the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, but ultimately decided against it. She endorsed Jean Charest in the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. Clark took out a membership in the party and received a ballot to vote in the race, her membership expired on June 23, 2023.

She was on the advisory council of Centre Ice Canadians in 2023. She left the group before it became the Canadian Future Party, stating she believed the group would&#x27;ve been better served focusing on supporting centrist candidates within existing parties.

===Federal Liberal leadership bid===
On June 27, 2024, she called on Justin Trudeau to resign as Prime Minister after the Conservative upset byelection win against the Liberals in Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s. In September 2024, Clark gave a speech at the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s annual general meeting about running a winning campaign. In October 2024, she confirmed that she was interested in running for the leadership should Justin Trudeau resign. 

Following Trudeau&#x27;s resignation announcement on January 6, 2025, Clark was considered as a possible candidate in the 2025 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election. She had been reportedly learning French prior to his resignation. On January 10, during an interview with CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The House&quot;, she announced that she was seriously considering running. She falsely claimed that she never took out a Conservative membership when she supported Charest against Pierre Poilievre in the 2022 Conservative Party leadership election despite multiple past statements saying she had done so and voted for him. Clark challenged the Conservative Party of Canada to publish her membership record, which it did shortly after the interview. She then apologized for misspeaking. On January 14, 2025, she declined to enter the race, citing her lack of French fluency and the short timescale of the race.

<doc id="536484" wikidata="Q271762" url="?curid=536484" title="Choroid">
<text>The choroid, also known as the choroidea or choroid coat, is a part of the uvea, the vascular layer of the eye. It contains connective tissues, and lies between the retina and the sclera. The human choroid is thickest at the far extreme rear of the eye (at 0.2 mm), while in the outlying areas it narrows to 0.1 mm. The choroid provides oxygen and nourishment to the outer layers of the retina. Along with the ciliary body and iris, the choroid forms the uveal tract.

The structure of the choroid is generally divided into four layers (classified in order of furthest away from the retina to closest):
*Haller&#x27;s layer – outermost layer of the choroid consisting of larger diameter blood vessels;
*Sattler&#x27;s layer – layer of medium diameter blood vessels;
*Choriocapillaris – layer of capillaries; and
*Bruch&#x27;s membrane (synonyms: Lamina basalis, Complexus basalis, Lamina vitra) – innermost layer of the choroid.

== Blood supply ==
There are two circulations of the eye: the retinal (in the retina) and uveal, supplied in humans by posterior ciliary arteries, originating from the ophthalmic artery (a branch of the internal carotid artery). The arteries of the uveal circulation, supplying the uvea and outer and middle layers of the retina, are branches of the ophthalmic artery and enter the eyeball without passing with the optic nerve. The retinal circulation, on the other hand, derives its circulation from the central retinal artery, also a branch of the ophthalmic artery, but passing in conjunction with the optic nerve. They branch in a segmental distribution to end arterioles and not anastomoses. This is clinically significant for diseases affecting choroidal blood supply. The macula responsible for central vision and the anterior part of the optic nerve are dependent on choroidal blood supply. The structure of choroidal vessels can be revealed by optical coherence tomography, and blood flow can be revealed by Indocyanine green angiography, and laser Doppler imaging.

===In bony fish===
Teleosts bear a body of capillary adjacent to the optic nerve called the choroidal gland. Though its function is not known, it is believed to be a supplemental oxygen carrier.

==Mechanism==
Melanin, a dark colored pigment, helps the choroid limit uncontrolled reflection within the eye that would potentially result in the perception of confusing images.

In humans and most other primates, melanin occurs throughout the choroid. In albino humans, frequently melanin is absent and vision is low. In many animals, however, the partial absence of melanin contributes to superior night vision. In these animals, melanin is absent from a section of the choroid and within that section a layer of highly reflective tissue, the tapetum lucidum, helps to collect light by reflecting it in a controlled manner. The uncontrolled reflection of light from dark choroid produces the photographic red-eye effect on photos, whereas the controlled reflection of light from the tapetum lucidum produces eyeshine (see Tapetum lucidum).

==History==
The choroid was first described by Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE) around 400 BCE, calling it the &quot;chitoon
malista somphos&quot; (more spongy tunic [than the sclera]). Democritus likely saw the choroid from dissections of animal eyes.

About 100 years later, Herophilos (c. 335 – 280 BCE) also described the choroid from his dissections on eyes of cadavers.

==Clinical significance==
Choroid is the most common site for metastasis in the eye due to its extensive vascular supply. The origin of the metastases are usually from breast cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and kidney cancer. Bilateral choroidal metastases are usually due to breast cancer, while unilateral metastasis is due to lung cancer. Choroidal metastases should be differentiated from uveal melanoma, where the latter is a primary tumour arising from the choroid itself.

<doc id="536488" wikidata="Q1650420" url="?curid=536488" title="Alley Oop">
<text>Alley Oop is a syndicated comic strip created December 5, 1932, by American cartoonist V. T. Hamlin, who wrote and drew the strip through four decades for Newspaper Enterprise Association. Hamlin introduced a cast of colorful characters and his storylines entertained with a combination of adventure, fantasy, and humor. Alley Oop, the strip&#x27;s title character, is a sturdy citizen in the prehistoric kingdom of Moo. He rides his pet dinosaur Dinny, carries a stone axe, and wears only a fur loincloth.

Alley Oop&#x27;s name was most likely derived from the French phrase &quot;allez, hop!&quot; In the 1933 press release that accompanied the launching of the strip with its new distributor NEA, Hamlin was quoted as saying &quot;I really can&#x27;t recall just how I struck upon the name &#x27;Alley Oop&#x27;, although it might be from the fact that the name is a French term used by tumblers. Alley Oop really is a roughhouse tumbler.&quot; The name of Alley&#x27;s girlfriend, Ooola, was a play on a different French phrase: &quot;oh là là&quot;.

==Story==
The first stories took place in the fictional &quot;Bone Age&quot; (similar to the Stone Age) and centered on Alley Oop&#x27;s dealings with his fellow cavemen in the kingdom of Moo. Oop and his pals had occasional skirmishes with the rival kingdom of Lem, ruled by King Tunk. The names Moo and Lem are references to the fabled lost continents of Mu and Lemuria.

On April 5, 1939, Hamlin introduced a new plot device which greatly expanded his choice of storylines: A time machine was invented by 20th-century scientist Dr. Elbert Wonmug; the name Wonmug was a pun on Albert Einstein, as &quot;ein&quot; is German for &quot;one&quot; and a &quot;stein&quot; is a type of drinking mug.

Oop was transported to the 20th century by an early test of the machine (in the daily strip of April 8 and the Sunday strip of April 9, 1939). He became Dr. Wonmug&#x27;s man in the field, embarking on expeditions to various periods in history, such as Ancient Egypt, the England of Robin Hood, and the American frontier. Oop met historical or mythical figures such as Cleopatra, King Arthur, and Ulysses in his adventures. In addition to the time machine, other science-fiction devices were introduced. Oop once drove an experimental electric-powered race car, and he has space-traveled to Venus, the moon (twice), and &quot;Earth-Two&quot;. During his adventures, he was often accompanied by his girlfriend Ooola and by the sometimes-villainous, sometimes-heroic George Oscar Boom (G. O. Boom). Laboratory assistant Ava Peckedge joined the cast in 1986.

==Syndication history==
&quot;Alley Oop&quot; was first distributed by the small syndicate Bonnet-Brown on December 5, 1932, but this run ended on April 26, 1933, when Bonnet-Brown became defunct. NEA picked up the strip and, starting on August 7, 1933, the earlier material was reworked for a larger readership. A full-page Sunday strip was added on September 9, 1934; the strip also appeared in half-page, tabloid, and half-tab formats, which were smaller and/or dropped panels. During World War II, newspapers eliminated full-page comics to save paper; starting on December 1, 1940, Alley Oop&#x27;s Sunday comic was offered in a smaller format which could, at an editor&#x27;s discretion, be further reconfigured to save space. Daily comics were first reduced in size on April 20, 1942, and have become smaller since then, but they have been appearing in color since September 15, 2008.

When Hamlin retired in 1971, his assistant Dave Graue took over. Graue had been assisting Hamlin since 1950 (starting as a letterer) and creating the daily solo since July 15, 1966, although co-signed by Hamlin. Hamlin&#x27;s last signed daily strip appeared December 31, 1972, and his last signed Sunday was April 1, 1973. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Graue wrote and drew the strip from his North Carolina studio. In 1974 Graue retained an assistant, Dave Olson, to ink and letter the strips. Olson worked on the strip until his retirement at the end of 1990; starting in 1991, Graue hired Jack Bender to finish the daily strips and produce the Sundays.

Graue initially decided to retire at the end of 1991, and the syndicate selected Jack Bender as the strip&#x27;s new creator. However, Bender was primarily interested in the art chores; he re-hired Graue to stay on as writer and recruited his wife Carole, a calligrapher. This team produced the strip from the last week of December 1991 through the end of August 2001; Graue wrote the strip and thumbnailed the art, from which Jack drew the strip and Carole lettered it. Graue finally retired in 2001, satisfied in having completed fifty years working on the strip. NEA then hired Carole as the new writer, based largely on the strength of an Alley Oop Christmas story that Carole had written and Jack had drawn, separately from the main Alley Oop strip, for the 1997 holiday season. Starting September 3, 2001, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; Sunday and daily strips were drawn entirely by Jack Bender and written, lettered, and colored by his wife Carole Bender. (On December 10, 2001, the 75-year-old Graue was killed in Flat Rock, North Carolina, when a dump truck hit his car.)

In January 2019, writer Joey Alison Sayers and artist Jonathan Lemon took over the comic.

At its peak, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; was carried by 800 newspapers. Today, it appears in more than 600 newspapers. The strip and collections of it were popular in Mexico (under the name &quot;Trucutú&quot;) and in Brazil (&quot;Brucutu&quot;). In 1995, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; was one of 20 strips showcased in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative United States postage stamps.

==Licensing and promotion==
In 1978, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; was adapted to animation as a segment of Filmation&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoon series &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot;, appearing intermittently alongside other comic-strip favorites: &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot;, &quot;Broom-Hilda&quot;, &quot;Emmy Lou&quot;, &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot;, and &quot;Nancy&quot;.

In 2002, Dark Horse Comics produced a limited-edition figure of the character in a brightly illustrated tin container. Alley Oop was issued as statue #28 — part of their line of Classic Comic Characters collectibles.

In 2008, to celebrate Alley Oop&#x27;s 75th year, the Benders conducted a contest for &quot;Dinosaur Drawings from Our Young Readers&quot;. The entry &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; holding a banner wishing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Alley Oop, by 12 year-old Erin Holloway of Hammond, Louisiana, was published in the comic strip on January 17, 2009.

==In popular culture==
The long-running success of the strip made the character a pop culture icon referred to in fiction, pop music and dance:
* The Belgian comic-strip series &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;, by Willy Vandersteen, features a caveman inspired by Alley Oop.
*An educated Neanderthal known as &quot;Alley Oop&quot; is a character in Clifford D. Simak&#x27;s science-fiction novel &quot;The Goblin Reservation,&quot; published in 1968.
*&quot;O. Paley&quot; (whose name was a loose anagram of &quot;Alley Oop&quot;) was the central figure in Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;The Alley Man&quot;, a 1959 novella about the last Neanderthal who has survived into the 20th century.
*The character was the subject of the 1960 number-one single &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, which was the only hit for the short-lived studio band The Hollywood Argyles. It was written and composed in 1957 by Dallas Frazier. Musicians on the record included Kim Fowley and Sandy Nelson. The song was later covered, most famously by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band but also by Dante &amp; the Evergreens, The Royal Guardsmen, Sha-Na-Na, The Beach Boys, Dave Van Ronk and George Thorogood &amp; the Destroyers, and it was included in choreographer Twyla Tharp&#x27;s 1970s ballet &quot;Deuce Coupe.&quot;
* Alley Oop is mentioned in the 1971 David Bowie song Life on Mars.
*There is an Alley Oop museum and fantasy land theme park in Iraan, Texas

==Main characters==
A main character is one who is a fixture of a particular setting. For example, King Guz and Queen Umpa are always present in ancient Moo, even if they are not central to every storyline.

Although Ooola is &quot;Alley Oop&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;, and their jealousy of potential rivals has driven many storylines, they rarely showed each other affection prior to the Benders&#x27; run. (More often, Ooola did serious violence to Alley&#x27;s cranium.) For the first 69 years of the strip&#x27;s existence, the two kissed only twice: once on August 14, 1945, as a last goodbye when they believed they were going to be drowned, and again on September 28, 1999, when Ooola pecked Alley on the cheek as thank-you for a timely rescue. The Benders made the couple more physically affectionate and even brought them to the altar—but, when they reached that point, Alley and Ooola decided that they made better friends than spouses.

Doctor Wonmug was drawn to look identical to the Grand Wizer. By the end of Dave Graue&#x27;s tenure, Wonmug and the Wizer had been in each other&#x27;s company five times; in each instance, the story was told as though the two characters had never met before, and the characters&#x27; identical appearances were remarked upon (May 26, 1945; December 7, 1960; July 17, 1963; July 30, 1965; September 24, 1970). The Benders addressed the similarity twice (on October 6, 2006, and March 23, 2007) by subverting it; that is, the other characters exclaimed that the two looked the same, but both the Wizer and Wonmug scoffed and claimed not to see any resemblance. In the daily strip on June 21, 1969, Wonmug&#x27;s birthdate is given as May 10, 1900 (which was also V.T. Hamlin&#x27;s birthday).

Dinny, Alley Oop&#x27;s pet dinosaur, was designed as an amalgam of different features and was not meant to resemble any known dinosaur. Dinny&#x27;s species is identified as a &quot;Cartoonosaurus&quot; in the daily strip on April 12, 1968.

==Supporting characters==
New stories typically introduced new characters, especially when those stories were set outside of Moo. Therefore, a &quot;supporting character&quot; is one who has been featured across multiple storylines.

Eeny, the dictator, was a transparent representation of Hitler. In her first story, in 1937, she recruited &quot;hairshirts&quot;, taught them a familiar arm-raised salute, and installed herself as &quot;dictator&quot; while leaving Queen Umpa as a figurehead ruler. In her second story, in 1942, she and her &quot;Moozys&quot;, headed by the armbanded &quot;Moostapo&quot;, overran the country and herded its citizens into &quot;concentration caves.&quot;

The Lemian King was inconsistent during Hamlin&#x27;s run. King Tunk first appeared in 1934 as a bald man with a stubbled chin, and he remained so through 1938. In 1944, this same character was named Wur rather than Tunk, although Sawalla&#x27;s King Wur had previously been featured in storylines alongside King Tunk. When Lem was re-introduced in 1954, its king was named Tunk but was clean-shaven and had a full head of hair; the Lemian king returned to his original design in 1959 but was again called Wur. He regained the name Tunk in 1961 (giving his full name as &quot;Clab Tunk&quot; on May 22, 1961) and from then on it stuck.

Dave Wowee, Wonmug&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson, was named in honor of (and drawn to resemble) Dave Graue, who typically told people that his last name &quot;rhymes with Wowee&quot;.

==Collections and reprints==

===Books===
===Magazines===

In addition to the magazines mentioned in the table below, &quot;Comics Revue&quot; has also reprinted Alley Oop daily and Sunday strips. The &quot;Menomonee Falls Guardian&quot;, published weekly, reprinted one week of daily strips in each issue. &quot;The Menomonee Falls Guardian Special&quot; #1–3 were sold separately; &quot;Special&quot; #4 was an insert included with issue #100.

===Comics===
Various strips have also been reprinted in comic-book form. The comic books tended to alter the original reading experience by colorizing the daily strips as well as rearranging, dropping, cropping or extending panels to fit the format. Recap and exposition panels, as well as strips that served as diversions from the perceived &quot;main story&quot; (such as an interlude of Alley and Foozy discovering how to drive a car while Dr. Wonmug fixed the time machine), were typically excised.

&quot;Famous Funnies&quot; and &quot;The Funnies&quot; re-lettered their Sunday-strip reprints, enlarging the text and simplifying the language, so that the comic would be more legible when reduced from tabloid to comic-book size. Although the first seven issues of Red Ryder Comics&#x27; Sunday-strip reprints were unaltered, in every subsequent issue the panels were enlarged, redrawn, rearranged or deleted.

The Antarctic Press series featured a combination of original material, direct reprints of newspaper comics, and redrawn adaptations of newspaper-strip stories. The reprints rearranged, resized, and sometimes omitted panels. These reprints and adaptations are noted in the list of storylines.

==Original publications==
The following publications were original material, not newspaper reprints:

==Sunday storylines==
The following table is a list of storylines featured in the Sunday comic strips. The ending of a storyline frequently overlapped with the beginning of the next, and actual story titles were provided only on a few occasions (e.g., &quot;Alley Oop at Crummystone Manor&quot; or &quot;The Perpetual Motion Machine&quot;). The dates and story descriptions given here are, therefore, not official or definitive delineations but may serve as a rough index to the history of the strip. Most of the Sunday strips from November 1996 onward are available on gocomics.com.

The Sunday strips&#x27; continuity ran separately from the daily strips until 2006 (with two exceptions, as noted in the list). In the first few years following the time machine&#x27;s introduction, Hamlin shifted the setting of the Sunday strip, sometimes abruptly, to match that of the daily storyline, but the Sunday and daily strips were entirely different stories, told in parallel, and they did not overlap. For example, when Oop was first brought to the 20th century, the Sunday storyline showed him doing little more than figuring out modern clothing and calmly running a few errands, whereas the daily strip had him roving all around the countryside in cars, trains, and planes, wreaking havoc and making headlines as the &quot;Phantom Ape&quot;. If the same events did occur in both continuities, they were always told differently: before the first time-machine story, for example, Alley Oop acquired the Moovian royal jewels; however, in the Sunday strip, Guz voluntarily installed Alley as king (so he could take a vacation), while in the daily strip Alley took the throne by force (as revenge for Guz stealing and eating Dinny&#x27;s egg).

After 1961, the Sunday strips featured no time travel but were set exclusively in Moo. It is possible that, from 1961 onward, the Sunday stories were meant to have taken place prior to Alley having met the time-machine crew because, in these strips, Alley was shown to be unaware of concepts he had already encountered in the time-travel storylines, such as shoes, or snow, or even the wheel.

Starting in January 2006, through the Benders&#x27; retirement in mid-2019, Sunday strips were not new stories but reprinted panels from the previous week&#x27;s daily strips.

Since late 2019, the artistic team has made the Sunday strips &quot;Little Oop&quot;, portraying a young Alley Oop. Little Oop was first set in a land of Moo that is anachronistic in a way similar to the Flintstones&#x27; &quot;modern stone age&quot;, but he met a time-traveling child named Penelope who brought him to the modern era (on March 1, 2020).

===Topper strips===

&quot;Alley Oop&quot;&#x27;s Sunday page had different toppers starting with the first strip and running through 1944:
*&quot;Dinny&#x27;s Family Album&quot;, September 9, 1934 – February 7, 1937
*&quot;Foozy&#x27;s Limericks&quot;, February 21 – May 16, 1937
*&quot;Prehistoric Cut-Outs in Modern Dress&quot;, May 23 – September 12, 1937
*&quot;Fragments&quot;, September 19, 1937 – April 9, 1939
*&quot;Scientists Say&quot;, April 16 – July 2, 1939
*&quot;Odds &#x27;n&#x27; Ends&quot;, July 9, 1939 – April 21, 1940
*&quot;Story of a Dinosaur Egg&quot;, April 28 – August 25, 1940
*&quot;Foozy&#x27;s Foolosophies&quot;, September 1, 1940 – September 5, 1943
*The characters argue over who gets to use the space (breaking the fourth wall), September 12, 1943 – January 2, 1944
*Buy War Bonds cartoon advertisements, January 9 – August 27, 1944

==Daily storylines==
The following is a list of storylines featured in the daily comic strips. Actual story titles were not provided in the strips; the dates and story descriptions given here are, therefore, not official or definitive delineations but may serve as a rough index to the history of the strip.

Although the Bonnet–Brown strips appeared in daily comics sections, their distribution was erratic, so that the strips&#x27; handwritten dates did not always match their actual publication dates. Consequently, after February 6, 1933, the strips were not dated but were instead given a sequential number (from 55 through 120), presumably so that editors could run them whenever they were received. The dates given here may, therefore, not be precisely accurate for every newspaper in which the strip appeared.

<doc id="536491" wikidata="Q7712476" url="?curid=536491" title="The Adventure of the Wax Gamblers">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Wax Gamblers&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes short story written in collaboration by Adrian Conan Doyle (the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator) and John Dickson Carr. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 20 June 1953, illustrated by Robert Fawcett.

== Plot ==

While waiting up late one night, Holmes and Watson are visited by the night watchman of a famous waxworks and his grand–daughter. The watchman has noticed that the playing cards in the hand of a wax figure in a Chamber of Horrors exhibit have changed. Holmes becomes immediately interested in this mystery and sends Watson to the exhibit to remove the cards in an orderly fashion and to bring them back to him in some envelopes. Holmes then demonstrates that the altered cards are related to the scandalous behavior of a gentleman and his wagering on horse races.
Two versions of the Darlington Substitution Scandal, which had been mentioned in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, are referenced in this story.

<text>The Whirlpool Aero Car or Spanish Aero Car is a cable car located in Niagara Falls, Ontario that transports passengers over a section of the Niagara River referred to as the Niagara Whirlpool. The system was designed by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo and has been upgraded several times since 1916 (in 1961, 1967 and 1984). The system uses one car that carries 35 standing passengers over a one-kilometre trip.

==Technical specifications==

The Aero Car is suspended on six interlocking steel cables, each of which is in diameter. The car is powered by an electric motor and travels at approximately . In the event of a power failure, a diesel engine drives a hydraulic pump to pull the carrier back to the loading/unloading terminal. It also has a rescue car which holds four passengers and one operator. The rescue car has so far only been used for training purposes.

The Aero Car is suspended between two Canadian points, though it crosses the Canadian and American borders four times on a full trip. The car crosses the border about from the starting point and runs through United States territory for about , but riders need no immigration clearance. At each end of the crossing, it is high, and in the centre, it averages above the river depending on the level of the water below. Its span is . The rapids entering the whirlpool below the Aero Car move at an estimated , and the flow of the water coming through the river is about in the summer months, and in the winter months. From the Aero Car, sightseers can see Whirlpool State Park in Niagara Falls, New York, as well as the Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station in Lewiston, New York. From the side or centre of the car, one can view the violent motion of the whirlpool below. Riders may also see hikers on nature trails and fishermen on both sides of the river.

The car was originally open, but a roof has been added to all later designs. A four-person rescue car is available (a smaller silver car stored at the opposite end in an indoor area), but not used in regular service.

The car operates from 10am to 5pm from the second week of March to the first week of November. Despite the similarities between the Aero Car and ski lifts, it has not been operated in winter since 2004.

<text>The rod, perch, or pole (sometimes also lug) is a surveyor&#x27;s tool and unit of length of various historical definitions. In British imperial and US customary units, it is defined as feet, equal to exactly of a mile, or yards (a quarter of a surveyor&#x27;s chain), and is exactly 5.0292 meters. The rod is useful as a unit of length because integer multiples of it can form one acre of square measure (area). The &#x27;perfect acre&#x27; is a rectangular area of 43,560 square feet, bounded by sides 660 feet (a furlong) long and 66 feet (a chain) wide (220 yards by 22 yards) or, equivalently, 40 rods by 4 rods. An acre is therefore 160 square rods or 10 square chains.

The name &quot;perch&quot; derives from the Ancient Roman unit, the &quot;pertica&quot;.
The measure also has a relationship with the military pike of about the same size. Both measures date from the sixteenth century, when the pike was still utilized in national armies. The tool has been supplanted, first by steel tapes and later by electronic tools such as surveyor lasers and optical target devices for surveying lands. In dialectal English, the term &quot;lug&quot; has also been used, although the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that this unit, while usually of feet, may also be of 15, 18, 20, or 21 feet.

In the United States until 1 January 2023, the rod was often defined as 16.5 US survey feet, or approximately 5.029 210 058 m.

==History==

In England, the perch was officially discouraged in favour of the rod as early as the 15th century; however, local customs maintained its use. In the 13th century, perches were variously recorded in lengths of , , and ; and even as late as 1820, a House of Commons report notes lengths of , , , , and even . In Ireland, a perch was standardized at , making an Irish chain, furlong and mile proportionately longer by 27.27% than the &quot;standard&quot; English measure.

Until English King Henry VIII seized the lands of the Roman Catholic Church in 1536, land measures as we now know them were essentially unknown. Instead a narrative system of landmarks and lists was used. Henry wanted to raise even more funds for his wars than he&#x27;d seized directly from church property (he&#x27;d also assumed the debts of the monasteries), and as James Burke writes and quotes in the book &quot;Connections&quot; that the English monk Richard Benese &quot;produced a book on how to survey land using the simple tools of the time, a rod with cord carrying knots at certain intervals, waxed and resined against wet weather.&quot; Benese poetically described the measure of an acre in terms of a perch:

The practice of using surveyor&#x27;s chains, and perch-length rods made into a detachable stiff chain, came about a century later when iron was a more plentiful and common material. A chain is a larger unit of length measuring , or 22 yards, or 100 links, or 4 rods (20.1168 meters). There are 10 chains or 40 rods in a furlong (eighth-mile), and so 80 chains or 320 rods in one statute mile (1760 yards, 1609.344 m, 1.609344 km); the definition of which was legally set in 1593 and popularized by Royal surveyor (called the &#x27;sworn viewer&#x27;) John Ogilby only after the Great Fire of London (1666).

An acre is defined as the area of 10 square chains (that is, an area of one chain by one furlong), and derives from the shapes of new-tech plows and the desire to quickly survey seized church lands into a quantity of squares for quick sales by Henry VIII&#x27;s agents; buyers simply wanted to know what they were buying whereas Henry was raising cash for wars against Scotland and France. Consequently, the surveyor&#x27;s chain and surveyor rods or poles (the perch) have been used for several centuries in Britain and in many other countries influenced by British practices such as North America and Australia. By the time of the industrial revolution and the quickening of land sales, canal and railway surveys, et al. Surveyor rods such as used by George Washington were generally made of dimensionally stable metal—semi-flexible drawn wrought iron linkable bar stock (not steel), such that the four folded elements of a chain were easily transportable through brush and branches when carried by a single man of a surveyor&#x27;s crew. With a direct ratio to the length of a surveyor&#x27;s chain and the sides of both an acre and a square (mile), they were common tools used by surveyors, if only to lay out a known plottable baseline in rough terrain thereafter serving as the reference line for instrumental (theodolite) triangulations.

The rod as a survey measure was standardized by Edmund Gunter in England in 1607 as a quarter of a chain (of ), or long.

===In ancient cultures===
The perch (pertica) as a lineal measure in Rome (also &quot;decempeda&quot;) was 10 Roman feet (2.96 metres), and in France varied from 10 feet (&quot;perche romanie&quot;) to 22 feet (&quot;perche d&#x27;arpent&quot;—apparently of &quot;the range of an arrow&quot;—about 220 feet). To confuse matters further, by ancient Roman definition, an arpent equalled 120 Roman feet. The related unit of square measure was the &quot;scrupulum&quot; or &quot;decempeda quadrata&quot;, equivalent to about .

===In continental Europe===

Units comparable to the perch, pole or rod were used in many European countries, with names that include and &quot;canne&quot;, , and &quot;pertica&quot;, and . They were subdivided in many different ways, and were of many different lengths.

===In Britain and Ireland===

In England, the rod or perch was first defined in law by the Composition of Yards and Perches, one of the statutes of uncertain date from the late 13th to early 14th centuries: &quot;tres pedes faciunt ulnam, quinque ulne &amp; dimidia faciunt perticam&quot; (three feet make a yard, five and a half yards make a perch).

The length of the chain was standardized in 1620 by Edmund Gunter at exactly four rods. Fields were measured in acres, which were one chain (four rods) by one furlong (in the United Kingdom, ten chains).

Bars of metal one rod long were used as standards of length when surveying land. The rod was still in use as a common unit of measurement in the mid-19th century, when Henry David Thoreau used it frequently when describing distances in his work, &quot;Walden&quot;.

In traditional Scottish units, a &quot;Scottish rood&quot; (&quot;ruid&quot; in Lowland Scots, &quot;ròd&quot; in Scottish Gaelic), also &quot;fall&quot; measures 222 inches (6 ells).

==Modern use==
The rod was phased out as a legal unit of measurement in the United Kingdom as part of a ten-year metrication process that began on 24 May 1965.

In the United States, the rod, along with the chain, furlong, and statute mile (as well as the survey inch and survey foot) were based on the pre-1959 values for United States customary units of linear measurement until 1 January 2023. The Mendenhall Order of 1893 defined the yard as exactly meters, with all other units of linear measurement, including the rod, based on the yard. In 1959, an international agreement (the international yard and pound agreement), defined the yard as the fundamental unit of length in the Imperial/USCU system, defined as exactly 0.9144 metres. However, the above-noted units, when used in surveying, may retain their pre-1959 values, depending on the legislation in each state. The U.S. National Geodetic Survey and National Institute of Standards and Technology have replaced the definition for the above-mentioned units by the international 1959 definition of the foot, being exactly 0.3048 meters.

Despite no longer being in widespread use, the rod is still employed in certain specialized fields. In recreational canoeing, maps measure portages (overland paths where canoes must be carried) in rods; typical canoes are approximately one rod long. The term is also in widespread use in the acquisition of pipeline easements, as the offers for an easement are often expressed on a &quot;price per rod&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the sizes of allotment gardens continue to be measured in square poles in some areas, sometimes being referred to simply as &quot;poles&quot; rather than &quot;square poles&quot;.

In Vermont, the default right-of-way width of state and town highways and trails is three rods . Rods can also be found on the older legal descriptions of tracts of land in the United States, following the &quot;metes and bounds&quot; method of land survey; as shown in this actual legal description of rural real estate: 

==Area and volume==
The terms &quot;pole&quot;, &quot;perch&quot;, &quot;rod&quot; and &quot;rood&quot; have been used as units of area, and &quot;perch&quot; is also used as a unit of volume. As a unit of area, a &quot;square perch&quot; (the perch being standardized to equal feet, or yards) is equal to a square rod, or acre. There are 40 square perches to a rood (for example a rectangular area of 40 rods times one rod), and 160 square perches to an acre (for example a rectangular area of 40 rods times 4 rods). This unit is usually referred to as a &quot;perch&quot; or &quot;pole&quot; even though &quot;square perch&quot; and &quot;square pole&quot; were the more precise terms. &quot;Rod&quot; was also sometimes used as a unit of area to refer to a rood.

However, in the traditional French-based system in some countries, 1 square &quot;perche&quot; is 42.21 square metres.

As of August 2013, perches and roods are used as government survey units in Jamaica. They appear on most property title documents. The perch is also in extensive use in Sri Lanka, being favored even over the rood and acre in real estate listings there. Perches were informally used as a measure in Queensland real estate until the early 21st century, mostly for historical gazetted properties in older suburbs.

===Volume===
A traditional unit of volume for stone and other masonry. A perch of masonry is the volume of a stone wall one perch () long, high, and thick. This is equivalent to exactly .

There are two different measurements for a perch depending on the type of masonry that is being built:

#A dressed stone work is measured by the -cubic foot perch () long, high, and thick. This is equivalent to exactly .
#a brick work or rubble wall made of broken stone of irregular size, shape and texture, made of undressed stone, is measured by the () long, high, and thick. This is equivalent to exactly .

<doc id="536509" wikidata="Q5630600" url="?curid=536509" title="HMAS Tamworth (J181)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Tamworth&quot; (J181/B250/A124), named for the city of Tamworth, New South Wales, was one of 60 s constructed during World War II and one of 20 built on Admiralty order but manned by personnel of and later commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). &quot;Tamworth&quot; later saw service in the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) and in the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4 inch Mk XIX gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Tamworth&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Tamworth&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 25 August 1941. She was launched on 14 March 1942 by Mrs. A. M. Horsburgh, the wife of one of the shipyard&#x27;s directors, and commissioned on 8 August 1942.

==Operational history==
From February 1943 until January 1945, &quot;Tamworth&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet. Following this, she was deployed with the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Tamworth&quot; returned to Australian operational control on 28 September 1945. &quot;Tamworth&quot; earned two battle honours for her wartime service, &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot; and &quot;Indian Ocean 1943–44&quot;.

After a brief period of service as a training vessel in Australian waters was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy on 30 April 1946. In RNLN service, the ship operated under the name HNLMS &quot;Tidore&quot;, and served until December 1949.

Following this, the ship was transferred to the Indonesian Navy, renamed RI &quot;Pati Unus&quot;, and served until disposal in 1969.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Deptford Horror&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes story by Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 18 September 1953, and was illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. The story was also included in the 1967 anthology &quot;Seventeen Steps to 221B&quot;.

== Plot ==
Holmes and Watson are called to a house in Deptford, due to the concerns of a young woman about her safety. Several of her relatives have died in the past few years of heart attacks. A relative who trains canaries also lives in the house. Holmes is not able to detect anything amiss until he and Watson are en route home, but he suddenly solves the mystery and returns to Deptford to save the life of the young woman from a death by heart failure.

== Allusions ==
This apocryphal story was inspired by the mention in &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot; of Holmes&#x27;s &quot;arrest of Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the East-End of London.&quot; In this story, Wilson is not arrested, but this discrepancy is explained as an error due to Dr Watson.

<text>Creepshow is a 1982 American horror comedy anthology film directed by George A. Romero and written by Stephen King, making this film his screenwriting debut. The film&#x27;s ensemble cast includes Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Fritz Weaver, Leslie Nielsen, Carrie Nye, E. G. Marshall, Viveca Lindfors, Ted Danson and Ed Harris, as well as King himself. The film was primarily shot on location in Pittsburgh and its suburbs, including Monroeville, where Romero leased an old boys&#x27; academy (Penn Hall) to build extensive sets for the film.

&quot;Creepshow&quot; consists of five short stories: &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot; (based on the King short story &quot;Weeds&quot;), &quot;Something to Tide You Over&quot;, &quot;The Crate&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re Creeping Up on You!&quot; Two of these stories were adapted from King&#x27;s short stories, with the film bookended by prologue and epilogue scenes featuring a young boy named Billy (played by King&#x27;s son, Joe), who is punished by his abusive father for reading horror comics.

&quot;Creepshow&quot; is an homage to the EC horror comics of the 1950s, such as &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; and &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;. In order for the film to give viewers a comic book feel, Romero hired long-time effects specialist Tom Savini to replicate comic-like effects.

The film earned $21 million in the United States. It was followed by a 1987 sequel, &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;, directed by the first film&#x27;s cinematographer, Michael Gornick, written by Romero and based on stories by King. A second sequel, &quot;Creepshow 3&quot;, was released in 2006, without involvement from either Romero or King.

==Plot==
===Prologue===
Billy Hopkins, a young boy, gets disciplined by his abusive father Stan for reading &quot;Creepshow&quot;, a horror comic. Not wanting his son to be exposed to the comic&#x27;s content, Stan throws it in the garbage. As Billy sits upstairs, wishing that his father rots in Hell, he hears a sound at the window.

The source of the noise turns out to be the Creep, the host of the comic book, who beckons him to come closer and removes the trash can&#x27;s lid.

===&quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;===
Sylvia Grantham meets her nephew Richard and niece Cass, along with Cass&#x27;s new husband Hank Blaine at the Grantham estate for the family&#x27;s annual dinner on the third Sunday in June. They proceed to tell Hank about the family matriarch, Great Aunt Bedelia, and of how it is an open secret in the family that she murdered her late father: the miserly and domineering Nathan Grantham who had accumulated the family&#x27;s fortune through bootlegging, fraud, extortion, and murder-for-hire.

Many years earlier, Bedelia was rendered an unstable spinster, the result of a lifetime spent putting up with her father&#x27;s incessant demands and emotional abuse, which got even worse after he suffered a stroke and she was made to nurse him full-time. The torture culminated with Nathan orchestrating a fatal &quot;hunting accident&quot;, which took the life of his daughter&#x27;s fiancé Peter Yarbro, in order to keep her under his thumb. That Father&#x27;s Day, Bedelia, driven into a murderous rage by Nathan&#x27;s constant insults and his petulant demands for his cake, bashed her overbearing father&#x27;s head in with a marble ashtray (which is hidden throughout the other stories).

In the present day, Bedelia arrives at Grantham Manor that evening. She stops by the family cemetery, just outside the mansion, to lay a flower at her father&#x27;s grave. She drunkenly reminisces about the murder, and reveals that Sylvia staged the killing as an accident in order to steal and distribute Nathan&#x27;s fortune among the rest of the family. She accidentally spills her whiskey bottle in front of the headstone. Just then, Nathan&#x27;s reanimated, putrefied, maggot-infested corpse emerges from the burial plot, still demanding the Father&#x27;s Day cake he never got. He avenges himself on Bedelia, strangling her. He proceeds to systematically wipe out the rest of his family: telekinetically crushing Hank to death with a gravestone, then twisting Sylvia&#x27;s neck; he also kills Mrs. Danvers, the Granthams&#x27; cook, possibly to cover his tracks. As a gruesome final joke, Nathan surprises Cass and Richard by presenting them with his Father&#x27;s Day cake: Sylvia&#x27;s severed head, covered with frosting and lit candles.

While the ending is left ambiguous in the film, with Nathan gloating over a terrified Cass and Richard in freeze-frame, the comic book based on the film has the Creep giving a vague hint that Nathan&#x27;s next act was to &quot;blow out their candles&quot;.

===&quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot;===
Jordy Verrill, a comedic and dim-witted yokel watches as a meteorite crash lands on his farm. Observing the crash site, Jordy gets his fingers burned when he tries to touch the meteorite. In a fantasy sequence, Jordy imagines selling the meteorite to the local college&#x27;s &quot;Department of Meteors&quot;, hoping that the sale will provide enough money to pay off a $200 bank loan. Taking precautions, he douses the meteorite with a bucket of water, causing it to crack open and spill a glowing blue liquid. In another fantasy sequence, Jordy reimagines the &quot;Department of Meteors&quot; refusing to purchase the now broken meteorite. Resolving to try and glue the halves together in the morning, Jordy nonchalantly dumps the liquid inside the meteor into the soil, but not before the substance makes contact with his skin.

As time passes, Jordy finds his fingers being overcome by what appears to be grass. He attempts to call a doctor, but he reconsiders doing so when he imagines (in another fantasy sequence) that the doctor will chop the afflicted fingers off without anesthetic. Over time, the strange substance continues to grow all over Jordy&#x27;s farm, everything Jordy has touched, and even on Jordy&#x27;s body, which causes him to itch furiously. Jordy panics as he discovers the increasing growth, and tries to calm himself by pouring himself a bottle of vodka and mixing it with orange juice. Soon after, Jordy falls asleep in a drunken stupor.

Jordy wakes up sometime later, believing the experience to have been a dream, but his hopes are dashed when he sees that the plant growth has managed to reach inside the house, as well as discovering in a mirror that he has now grown a green beard. He starts to draw a bath to relieve the itching, but he is visited by the ghost of his deceased father, who appears in his mirror and warns him against doing so by telling him that water is what the plants want. Grimly rationalizing that not getting in would only delay the inevitable, Jordy laments that &quot;[he&#x27;s] a goner already.&quot; When the itching from the growth on his skin becomes unbearable, Jordy succumbs to temptation and collapses into the bathwater.

The next morning, Jordy&#x27;s farm has been completely coated with dense layers of the alien vegetation, with Jordy himself transformed into a human-shaped collection of plant matter. In despair, he reaches for a Coach Gun, prays to God that his luck will be in just this once, and blows the top of his head off, killing himself. Immediately afterwards, a TV weather forecast announces that moderate temperatures and heavy rains are predicted, as the plants spread down the roads to other towns.

===&quot;Something to Tide You Over&quot;===
Richard Vickers is a vicious and heartless millionaire whose spry jocularity belies his cold-blooded and murderous nature. He visits Harry Wentworth, the man with whom his wife Becky is having an affair. Richard mentions that he and Becky never shared any actual affection, but such is beside the issue; Richard&#x27;s point of honor is always keeping what&#x27;s &quot;his&quot;, a rule that he enforces no matter what. Rather than physically assault Harry, Richard plays a recording of Becky&#x27;s voice, where she tearfully begs Harry to help her. Both men travel to Comfort Point, Richard&#x27;s isolated beach house. Richard points out what appears to be a burial mound in the sand. When Harry promptly runs to it, Richard pulls a gun on him. He forces Harry to jump into the empty hole and begin burying himself.

Eventually, Richard finishes burying Harry neck-deep in the sand below the high-tide line. Richard then sets up a closed-circuit TV camera and a VCR to record Harry. He also brings along a monitor displaying Becky, who is also buried up to her neck farther down the beach, where the rising tide is already washing over her face. Richard does tell Harry that he and Becky have a chance of survival: if they can hold their breath long enough for the sand to loosen once the seawater covers them, they can break free and escape. With that, Richard abandons Harry and returns to Comfort Point. Sipping a cocktail, Richard watches with great satisfaction as Harry and Becky slowly drown. Just before Harry is completely submerged by the advancing tide, he looks directly into the camera and vows revenge on Richard.

Hours later, Richard returns to Harry&#x27;s &quot;grave&quot; to collect the tape. He finds the ruined monitor, but no sign of Harry. Not disturbed, Richard writes this off as the body having been carried away by the current. Later that night, Richard hears voices calling his name, as a mysterious unseen presence easily bypasses Comfort Point&#x27;s extensive security system. The culprits turn out to be Harry and Becky, the two lovers having returned as waterlogged, seaweed-covered revenants intent on revenge on their killer. Richard shoots them, but when the bullets have no effect, he barricades himself in his bedroom, only to find Becky and Harry already inside. The two victims taunt Richard, who laughs insanely.

Sometime later, the undead lovers have buried Richard up to his neck on the beach. They have since disappeared together into the surf, leaving Richard&#x27;s own seaweed-covered video camera to record his coming demise. As the approaching tide proceeds to drown him, the hysterical Richard screams that he can hold his breath &quot;for a LONG time!&quot;

===&quot;The Crate&quot;===
Mike Latimer, a janitor at Horlicks University, drops a quarter he was flipping and it rolls behind a grate under a basement staircase. While attempting to retrieve the coin, he comes across a wooden storage crate marked &quot;Ship to Horlicks University via Julia Carpenter - Arctic Expedition - June 19, 1834&quot; hidden underneath the staircase. He calls Professor Dexter Stanley to notify him of the discovery, drawing Dexter away from a faculty social gathering. Also at the gathering are Dexter&#x27;s best friend, the mild-mannered Professor Henry Northrup, and Henry&#x27;s perpetually drunk, obnoxious, and emotionally-abusive wife Wilma &quot;Billie&quot;, who has a penchant for embarrassing herself, belittling her husband, and annoying or insulting everybody she meets. Henry regularly fantasizes about killing his horrific wife, but is far too timid to actually go through with it.

Stanley meets Mike at Amberson Hall, where the former discovers the crate. Both men move the crate into a nearby biology lab, where they tirelessly work to get it open. In the process, Mike sticks his hand inside the crate and begins yelling in pain. The crate opens to reveal its contents: a shaggy, ape-like creature with sharp fangs. Despite its diminutive size, the creature promptly kills and devours Mike whole, leaving behind only his mangled boot. Fleeing the lab, Dexter bumps into graduate student Charlie Gereson, to whom he frantically relays what happened. While skeptical, Charlie agrees to investigate the professor&#x27;s claims. The two find the lab covered in blood, with no sign of the creature or its crate. They discover that the crate has been moved back under the stairs, where they also discover Mike&#x27;s boot. Wanting to measure the bite marks on the boot, Charlie examines the crate closer. The creature pounces on Charlie and kills him, prompting Dexter to escape and take the boot with him.

Traumatized and hysterical, Dexter runs to Henry&#x27;s house after Billie leaves for the evening. He tells Henry everything that happened since the crate was discovered, and insists that the monster must be disposed of somehow. Seeing the supposed creature as an ideal way to rid himself of his wife, Henry appears to believe Dexter&#x27;s story. To this end, Henry spikes Dexter&#x27;s drink with sleeping pills and writes a note stating that Dexter had supposedly assaulted a female student. This brings Billie rushing to Amberson Hall, where Henry has since cleaned up the bloody lab. When Billie arrives, Henry lures her under the basement stairs, trying to awaken the creature. As Billie rants at Henry for dragging her out there in the middle of the night and assaulting her, the beast awakens and proceeds to consume her.

The next morning, Henry tells Dexter that he secured the beast inside its crate, and then dumped the crate into a nearby quarry, watching as it sank to the bottom. He convinces Dexter that the creature has drowned, and both men agree to let the authorities handle the disappearances. Unknown to Henry and Dexter, the beast is shown to still be alive, and is last seen tearing the submerged crate apart.

===&quot;They&#x27;re Creeping Up on You!&quot;===
Upson Pratt is a ruthlessly cruel business mogul who suffers from mysophobia, which has rendered him living in a hermetically-sealed penthouse apartment outfitted with electric locks and surveillance cameras. His apparent contacts with the outside world are through the telephone and are primarily made to put-upon employees. One stormy night, Pratt receives a call from George Gendron, one of his subordinates, about the fact that his company (Pratt International) has recently instigated a corporate takeover of the Pacific Aerodyne company. Gendron also informs Mr. Pratt that the takeover caused a business rival, Norman Castonmeyer, to commit suicide, much to Pratt&#x27;s delight.

During the call, Pratt slowly begins finding cockroaches around his apartment. Being a fanatical insect hater, Pratt arms himself with bug spray in an attempt to combat the insects. Before long, someone manages to get through on Pratt&#x27;s private line. The caller turns out to be Norman Castonmeyer&#x27;s widow Lenore, who tearfully recalls her husband&#x27;s final moments and curses Pratt for causing his death. After finding pieces of cockroaches in his food processor, Pratt receives a call from his building&#x27;s superintendent Carl Reynolds, currently on vacation in Orlando. Despite his vacation, Pratt forces Reynolds to send the building&#x27;s handyman Mr. White to call an exterminator under the threat of firing him.

Soon after, Pratt discovers more cockroaches in a box of cereal, trying and failing to crush any that he can. Mr. White soon arrives outside Pratt&#x27;s door, and tells him (speaking in a stereotypical minstrel voice to mock him) that he is calling a fumigation service. A rolling blackout then heads towards the building. During the blackout, cockroaches numbering in the hundreds of thousands begin pouring out of every nook and cranny in Pratt&#x27;s apartment. As the insects overwhelm Pratt, he activates the emergency power and attempts to call the police for assistance. The police are unfortunately unable to be of any help because of the blackout, nor is Mr. White, who is stuck in the elevator.

At his wit&#x27;s end, Pratt locks himself inside a climate-controlled panic room to escape the growing swarm of cockroaches. He gets another call from Lenore, who continues to curse at him. It&#x27;s during this call that Pratt finds his bedcovers wriggling, and he removes them to discover that the cockroaches have already invaded the panic room. With no way for Pratt to escape, the cockroach swarm charges at him, which induces a fatal heart attack.

When electricity returns to the building, the apartment is utterly devoid of cockroaches. Pratt&#x27;s corpse is shown in the panic room as Mr. White calls in to report. When he gets no answer, Mr. White mockingly asks Pratt &quot;Bugs got your tongue?&quot; Pratt&#x27;s body soon begins to contort as cockroaches burst out of his mouth and chest, re-enveloping the panic room. Mr. White continues to call Pratt&#x27;s name to get a response, then calls him a bastard when he gets no answer.

===Epilogue===
The next morning, two garbage collectors find the &quot;Creepshow&quot; comic book on the curb. They look at the book&#x27;s ads for X-ray specs and a Charles Atlas bodybuilding course. They also see the advertisement for the Voodoo doll that was briefly glimpsed earlier, but lament that the order form has already been redeemed.

Inside the Hopkins house, Stan complains to his wife that he is suffering from a stiff neck, figuring that he must have strained it. Upstairs, Billy is revealed to have sent away for the voodoo doll, and has decorated it with a piece of his father&#x27;s clothing and some of his hair. Stan clutches his throat in pain as Billy repeatedly and gleefully jabs the voodoo doll with a pin, finally getting revenge on his father for his abuse.

The images of Billy jabbing the doll becomes the cover of the next issue of &quot;Creepshow&quot;. The Creep is seen holding the same comic book, laughing sinisterly as a candle goes out.

==Production==
&quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Something to Tide You Over&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re Creeping Up on You!&quot; are original stories by King written for the film. &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot; is based on King&#x27;s short story &quot;Weeds&quot; and &quot;The Crate&quot; is based on the short story of the same name.

In keeping with Romero&#x27;s tradition of filming in and around the Pittsburgh area, most of the film was shot in an empty all-girls school located outside Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The school was converted into a film studio, and the episodes &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re Creeping Up on You&quot;, as well as the prologue and epilogue, were filmed in their entirety at the former school. Filming took place at the Greensburg location throughout 1981.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Ted Danson explained the brief shot of his character drowning underwater: &quot;So they make a little aquarium tank. I got in a wetsuit and climbed in, and somebody would reach down with an oxygen tank ventilator thingy, and I&#x27;d breathe, and then they&#x27;d take that out. And there was a yoke made out of... I don&#x27;t know, wood and fake sand, so it looked like my head was buried in the sand, underwater.&quot;

Ray Mendez, an entomologist with the American Museum of Natural History, and David Brody provided 20,000 cockroaches for the segment &quot;They&#x27;re Creeping Up on You&quot;. In the final scene of the segment—in which the room is almost filled with cockroaches—many of the apparent insects were actually nuts and raisins, as specified by Tom Savini.

==Release ==
&quot;Creepshow&quot; was given a four-week test release in Boston during July 1982 to get a sense of how to market it later on, with the hugely successful results convincing Warner Bros. that they had a hit on their hands. It went into wide release on Wednesday, November 10, 1982. In its opening weekend, &quot;Creepshow&quot; grossed $5,870,889 from 1,127 theatres, ranking number 1 at the U.S. box office, replacing &quot;First Blood&quot; in the top spot, and had a five-day total of $8,003,017. In total it grossed $21,028,755 in the United States and Canada, making it the highest grossing horror film for the Warner Bros. studio that year.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 66% approval rating based on 74 reviews; the average rating is 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;It&#x27;s uneven, as anthologies often are, but &quot;Creepshow&quot; is colorful, frequently funny, and treats its inspirations with infectious reverence.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Romero and King have approached this movie with humor and affection, as well as with an appreciation of the macabre&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;The best things about &quot;Creepshow&quot; are its carefully simulated comic-book tackiness and the gusto with which some good actors assume silly positions. Horror film purists may object to the levity even though failed, as a lot of it is&quot;. Gary Arnold, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote, &quot;What one confronts in &quot;Creepshow&quot; is five consistently stale, derivative horror vignettes of various lengths and defects&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott wrote, &quot;The Romero-King collaboration has softened both the horror and the cynicism, but not by enough to betray the sources — &quot;Creepshow&quot; is almost as funny and as horrible as the filmmakers would clearly love it to be&quot;. David Ansen, in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, wrote, &quot;For anyone over 12 there&#x27;s not much pleasure to be had watching two masters of horror deliberately working beneath themselves. &quot;Creepshow&quot; is a &quot;faux-naif&quot; horror film: too arch to be truly scary, too elemental to succeed as satire&quot;. In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;But the treatment manages to be both perfunctory and languid; the jolts can be predicted by any ten-year-old with a stopwatch. Only the story in which Evil Plutocrat E.G. Marshall is eaten alive by cockroaches mixes giggles and grue in the right measure&quot;.

&quot;Bravo&quot; awarded it the 99th spot on their &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;, mostly for the scene with the cockroaches bursting out of Upson Pratt&#x27;s body.

==Home media==
The film was first released in 1983 on VHS and CED Videodisc.

In the United States, Warner Bros. released a one-disc set on October 26, 1999, with the only extra feature being the film&#x27;s trailer. No other special features have ever been released with the Region 1 version. The Region 1 DVD was a two-sided disc. One side was the 1.85:1 transfer (widescreen) version of the film and the other side was the full-screen version,

A two-disc Special Edition DVD of &quot;Creepshow&quot; was released on October 22, 2007, in the UK. The discs feature a brand new widescreen transfer of the film sourced from the original master, a making-of documentary running 90 minutes (titled &quot;Just Desserts: The Making of Creepshow&quot;), behind-the-scenes footage, rare deleted scenes, galleries, a commentary track with director George A. Romero and make-up effects artist, Tom Savini, and more. The owner of Red Shirt Pictures, Michael Felsher is responsible for the special edition, the documentary and audio commentary in particular.

On September 8, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray. Again the only special feature is the film&#x27;s trailer. Scream Factory re-released the film on Blu-ray with new special features (along with most of the ones from the UK release) on October 23, 2018. This release is sourced from a brand new 4K scan of the original camera negative, despite the fact there was some criticism with the 5.1 audio track having been pitched too high and having sync issues (the included stereo track however has no issues).

Second Sight acquired the license to release a new Blu-ray in the United Kingdom. It contains all of the special features included in the special two-disc edition which was released in 2007. It also contains a new audio commentary with Director of Photography Michael Gornick, Actor John Amplas, Property Master Bruce Alan Green and make-up effects assistant Darryl Ferrucci.

On June 27, 2023, Scream Factory released a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray of the film, featurning a &quot;2023 4K scan of the original camera negative supervised and approved by director of photography Michael Gornick&quot; and new Dolby Atmos audio track, together with the 5.1 and stereo tracks included on the 2018 Blu-ray release.

==Legacy, sequels, and adaptations==
The film was adapted into an actual comic book of the same name soon after the film&#x27;s release. Bernie Wrightson, known for his work on &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and Warren magazines, and fittingly influenced by the 1950s E.C. Comics, did the artwork and is also the uncredited writer of the comic.

&quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; was the television spin-off. Due to Warner Bros holding certain rights including the name Creepshow, the title was changed.

A sequel, &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;, was released in 1987, and was once again based on Stephen King short stories, with a screenplay from &quot;Creepshow&quot; director George A. Romero. The film contained only three tales of horror (due to budget constraints) as opposed to the original&#x27;s five stories.

Another sequel, &quot;Creepshow 3&quot;, featuring no involvement from Stephen King, George A. Romero, or anyone else involved in the production of the first two films, was released direct-to-video in 2007 (though it was finished in 2006) to mostly negative reviews. This film, in a fashion similar to the original &quot;Creepshow&quot;, features five short, darkly comedic horror stories.

Taurus Entertainment (rights holders of the original &quot;Creepshow&quot;) licensed the rights to Jace Hall, of HDFILMS, a Burbank, California company, to produce &quot;Creepshow: RAW&quot;, a web series based upon the original film. The pilot episode for &quot;Creepshow: RAW&quot; was wrapped on July 30, 2008. The pilot was directed by Wilmer Valderrama and features Michael Madsen. No other episodes have been produced.

Another &quot;Creepshow&quot; television series was announced in July 2018, which was produced by Greg Nicotero and streamed on Shudder. Each episode of the series consisted of two stories. On January 16, 2019, it was announced that one of the segments of the pilot episode will be based on Stephen King&#x27;s short story, &quot;Survivor Type&quot; from his 1985 collection, &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;. Adrienne Barbeau will return in a new role, and Tobin Bell will contribute a role. On July 19, 2019, it was announced that the series will premiere on September 26, 2019. The series spawned a tie-in novel from Scholastic Books entitled &quot;Creepshow: The Taker&quot;, featuring two novellas inspired from the show. A follow-up novel is scheduled for release in April 2021, entitled &quot;Creepshow: The Cursed&quot;, also featuring two novellas inspired by the show. On October 30, 2019, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on April 1, 2021. On February 18, 2021, the series was renewed for a third season.

On August 3, 2019, Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences announced that &quot;Creepshow&quot; would be coming to Halloween Horror Nights exclusively at its Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. The maze featured three segments from the 1982 movie as well as two others from the newly made web television version for Shudder.

<text>Big Bear Lake is a reservoir in the western United States, located in the San Bernardino Mountains in San Bernardino County, California. It is a snow and rain-fed lake, having no other means of tributaries or mechanical replenishment.

At a surface elevation of above sea level, it has an east–west length of approximately and is approximately at its widest measurement, though the lake&#x27;s width mostly averages a little more than . These approximations are based on the lake having an optimum retainable water level. At dam&#x27;s end, Big Bear measures its deepest water at .
== History ==

The region has been the ancestral home of the indigenous Serrano people for approximately 2,500 years. They referred to the territory as &quot;Yuhaviat&quot; which translates into &quot;Pine Place&quot;. They inhabited small villages of 10 to 30 round buildings located along fresh water sources and subsisted on berries, nuts, tubers, acorns, and plentiful game harvested along the lush valley. The Serrano looked at the native grizzly bears as ancestors and did not eat the meat or wear the fur of these massive animals. Several communities in the area feature place names reflecting the Big Bear region&#x27;s rich Native history. These include Yucaipa, Cucamonga, and Muscupiabe.

European explorers first saw the area when a Native American hunting party was formed by Benjamin Wilson. Wilson moved to California during the days of Mexican territorial Alta California. He married into the Spanish landholder family, the Yorbas, and bought a portion of Rancho Jurupa (Riverside) from Juan Bandini. He became a local rancher statesman.

Wilson had signed on as Justice of the Peace of the Inland Territory and was commissioned by the territorial authorities to locate and pursue Native Americans suspected of raiding ranches in nearby Riverside. This group, led by the fierce Chief Walkara, drove the herd into the Lucerne Valley on the north side of the San Bernardinos. In 1845, Wilson gathered a posse of 44 men, 22 of whom he sent through the Cajon Pass while he engineered a pincer movement with the other 22 men into the headwaters of the Santa Ana River, effectively cutting the Utes off at the other end of Lucerne.

On the trip Wilson came upon a broad watershed teeming with wildlife, particularly bear. His posse immediately became a hunting party where the men were split into 11 pairs, each pair bringing back a bear hide. Wilson dubbed the grassy expanse &quot;Bear Valley&quot; and one of the nearby shallow seasonal marshes &quot;Big Bear Lake&quot;. This same ephemeral feature is today called Baldwin Lake after Elias J. &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin of Rancho Santa Anita, who bought the nearby Gold Mountain Mine that was renamed for him in 1876. On Wilson&#x27;s return trip, the party took 11 more bear pelts.

In 1859, the valley became a venue for gold prospectors. William F. Holcomb, a prospector from Indiana, moved to Los Angeles from the Northern California mines where he heard about the prospecting at Big Bear. He moved to Starvation Flats, where he had little luck the first winter. Because of his marksmanship, he was hired by several of the other miners to hunt bear for meat. With his Indian companion, Holcomb tracked, shot and wounded a grizzly bear one ridge north of Bear Valley. There he noticed a vein of quartz flecked with gold. When this discovery was revealed, the Southern California gold rush was on, and Holcomb Valley quickly became the largest populated area in San Bernardino County.

In 1884 marshy, nearly flat Bear Valley was dammed with a single arch granite impoundment, which held back some of water for irrigation purposes in the Redlands area. Redlands citrus growers found that the 1884 dam produced insufficient water. The Bear Valley Mutual Water Company (successor to Bear Valley Irrigation Company) hired John S. Eastwood to design a new dam. In a multiple arch dam was constructed about downstream of the old dam and increased the lake capacity to . The original granite dam still remains, usually under about 20 feet of water. A highway bridge (SR 18) was built over the arches of the new dam in 1923. A new bypass bridge was built next to the old bridge in 2009, and the old bridge on top of the new dam was removed. Elevation at the surface is , but this level fluctuates according to annual snowmelt and runoff. Big Bear Municipal Water District acquired the dam and other assets from the Mutual Water Company in 1977.

The unregulated hunting of grizzly bear in the San Bernardinos took a heavy toll upon the once significant population, and by 1906 all the local &quot;Ursus californicus&quot; were killed off.

Tourism began with the onset of the automobile and the eventual establishment of highways accessing the remote area. Hollywood soon discovered Big Bear, and several movies, particularly westerns, have been filmed in the region.

==Geography==

Big Bear Lake is geophysically defined by its North and South Shore. Big Bear Boulevard follows the South Shore and leads into the Big Bear Valley as a continuation of Highway 18 (the so-called Rim of the World Highway, which approaches from the west). Big Bear Boulevard winds east through Papoose Bay, Boulder Bay and Metcalf Bay, then leads directly east to the city of Big Bear Lake. At a point called The Village, the road turns toward the lake and then curves eastward to Moonridge, the ski resorts at Snow Summit and Bear Mountain, and Stanfield Cutoff, a causeway located near the east end of the lake. Big Bear Boulevard then continues east into Big Bear City, which is an unincorporated community despite its name. Bear Creek and Siberia Creek flow into the lake and Bear Creek flows out of the lake, traveling about southwest to the Santa Ana River.

North Shore (Highway 38) begins at the Dam Junction of Highway 18. It travels east past the historic location of Gray&#x27;s Landing, a famous 1920s fishing camp. It turns north around Grout Bay and travels through the small unincorporated town of Fawnskin. The road meanders across North Shore through Forestry lands, past the Big Bear Solar Observatory, past the Big Bear Discovery Center, past the Serrano Campground (U.S.F.S), accessing the public boat launch, and Stanfield Cutoff. North Shore Drive continues east into Big Bear City and Baldwin Lake.

The primary approach to Big Bear is via Highway 330 out of San Bernardino through Running Springs where it intersects Highway 18. Highway 18 proceeds past Arrowbear and Snow Valley, over 7,200 ft (2,190 m) Lake Vista Summit and across the &quot;Arctic Circle&quot; for a total distance of . Big Bear Lake can also be accessed by Hwy 38 (referred to as &#x27;The Backside&#x27;) at the San Bernardino (10) Freeway near Redlands, and takes a mile route that passes through Big Bear City on the east. From north of Lucerne Valley, it can be accessed by Highway 18 over the pass into Baldwin Lake and through the north side, into Big Bear City.

===Climate===

According to the National Weather Service, the warmest month at Big Bear is July, with a daily average temperature of . The coolest month is January, with a daily average temperature of . There are an average of 1.7 days each year with highs of or higher. Freezing temperatures have occurred in every month and occur on an average of 186 days each year, on average from September 24 to June 4. With a period of record dating only back to 1960, the highest temperature recorded was , last recorded on July 15, 1998, while lowest was on January 29, 1979.

Due to the elevation of the weather station, precipitation is greater than in the lowlands of San Bernardino County, averaging a year. The maximum 24-hour precipitation was on December 6, 1966. Measurable precipitation normally occurs 44.9 days a year. Mountain thunderstorms occasionally produce heavy rainfall, even in midsummer (when most southern California lowland locations are quite dry). Big Bear Lake&#x27;s climate is &quot;Csb&quot; (Warm-summer Mediterranean) under the Köppen climate classification.

In contrast to most of southern California, the Big Bear Lake region normally receives significant winter snow because of its high elevation. Snowfall, as measured at lake level, averages per season; upwards of can accumulate on the forested ridges bordering the lake, at elevation above . In February 1990, of snow were recorded. The most snow in 24 hours was on March 27, 1991. The greatest snow depth was on February 3, 1979. Snow has fallen in every month except July and August. There are normally 18 days each year with measurable snow of or more.
==Transportation==
Located east of Los Angeles and surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest, Big Bear Lake is accessible via three scenic highways: Highway 330 from San Bernardino, Highway 38 from Redlands, and Highway 18 from Victorville to the west, San Bernardino to the east.

Public transit to and from San Bernardino, and among the communities surrounding the lake are provided by Mountain Transit.

==Activities==
Big Bear Lake provides an attractive setting for many outdoor activities, including fishing (trout, bluegill, crappie, catfish and largemouth bass), pleasure boating, and water skiing. Because of the very cold water and the presence of underwater obstacles near the shorelines, swimming is discouraged. The lake is patrolled by the BBMWD Lake Patrol.

Many lakeside residents have private docks, and visiting boaters obtain mooring in several of the marinas found on both shores. Big Bear Municipal Water District (a special district of the State of California) provides public launches on the east end and west end of North Shore. Local marinas rent various sport and pleasure boats, and parasailing is available.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed an advisory for Big Bear Lake because of mercury and PCBs found in fish caught here. The advisory provides safe eating advice for black bass species, common carp, crappie, and rainbow trout.

==California Historical Landmark==
California Historical Landmark at the Big Bear Dam reads:
*&quot;NO. 725 OLD BEAR VALLEY DAM - In 1884 Frank Brown built an unusual dam here to supply irrigation water for the Redlands area. The single-arch granite dam formed Big Bear Lake, then the world&#x27;s largest man-made lake. Engineers claimed the dam would not hold, and declared it &quot;The Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; when it did. The old dam is usually underwater because of the 20-foot higher dam built 200 feet west in 1912. &quot;

The Bear Valley Dams were also designated as a Local Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1972.

Captive portals are used for a broad range of mobile and pedestrian broadband services – including cable and commercially provided Wi-Fi and home hotspots. A captive portal can also be used to provide access to enterprise or residential wired networks, such as apartment houses, hotel rooms, and business centers.

The captive portal is presented to the client and is stored either at the gateway or on a web server hosting the web page. Depending on the feature set of the gateway, websites or TCP ports can be allow-listed so that the user would not have to interact with the captive portal in order to use them. The MAC address of attached clients can also be used to bypass the login process for specified devices.

WISPr refers to this web browser-based authentication method as the Universal Access Method (UAM).

==Uses==

Captive portals are primarily used in open wireless networks where the users are shown a welcome message informing them of the conditions of access (allowed ports, liability, etc.). Administrators tend to do this so that their own users take responsibility for their actions and to avoid any legal responsibility. Whether this delegation of responsibility is legally valid is a matter of debate. Some networks may also require entering the user&#x27;s cell phone number or identity information so that administrators can provide information to authorities in case there was illegal activity on the network.

Often captive portals are used for marketing and commercial communication purposes. Access to the Internet over open Wi-Fi is prohibited until the user exchanges personal data by filling out a web-based registration form in a web browser. The web-based form either automatically opens in a web browser, or appears when the user opens a web browser and tries to visit any web page. In other words, the user is &quot;captive&quot; - unable to access the Internet freely until the user is granted access to the Internet and has &quot;completed&quot; the captive portal. This allows the provider of this service to display or send advertisements to users who connect to the Wi-Fi access point. This type of service is also sometimes known as &quot;social Wi-Fi&quot;, as they may ask for a social network account to login (such as Facebook). Over the past few years, such social Wi-Fi captive portals have become commonplace with various companies offering marketing centered around Wi-Fi data collection.

The user can find many types of content in the captive portal, and it&#x27;s frequent to allow access to the Internet in exchange for viewing content or performing a certain action (often, providing personal data to enable commercial contact); thus, the marketing use of the captive portal is a tool for lead generation (business contacts or potential clients).

==Implementation==

There are various ways to implement a captive portal.

=== HTTP redirect ===
A common method is to direct all World Wide Web traffic to a web server, which returns an HTTP redirect to a captive portal. When a modern, Internet-enabled device first connects to a network, it sends out an HTTP request to a detection URL predefined by its vendor and expects an HTTP status code 200 OK or 204 No Content. If the device receives a HTTP 2xx status code, it assumes it has unlimited internet access. Captive portal prompts are displayed when you are able to manipulate this first HTTP message to return a HTTP status code of 302 (redirect) to the captive portal of your choice. specifies the 511 Network Authentication Required status code.

===ICMP redirect===

Client traffic can also be redirected using ICMP redirect on the layer 3 level.

===Redirect by DNS===

When a client requests a resource on a remote host by name, DNS is queried to resolve that hostname. In a captive portal, the firewall will make sure that only the DNS server(s) provided by the network&#x27;s DHCP can be used by unauthenticated clients (or, alternatively, it will forward all DNS requests by unauthenticated clients to that DNS server). This DNS server will return the IP address of the captive portal page as a result of all DNS lookups.

In order to perform redirection by DNS the captive portal uses DNS hijacking to perform an action similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. To limit the impact of DNS poisoning, a TTL of 0 is typically used.

===Captive Portal API===
 introduces a standardized method for networks to inform clients about the presence of Captive Portal API endpoints using DHCP (both IPv4 and DHCPv6) options and IPv6 NDP router advertisements. RFC 8910 was implemented in systemd-networkd v254 in July 2023. NetworkManager discussions have also explored using them for captive portal interactions.

==Detection==
Captive portal detection URLs typically return a minimal, standardized response when not behind a captive portal. When the device receives the expected response, it concludes that it has direct internet access. If the response is different, the device assumes it is behind a captive portal and triggers the captive portal login process.

==Limitations==

=== Security ===
Captive portals have been known to have incomplete firewall rule setssuch as outbound ports being left openthat allow clients to circumvent the portal.

==== DNS tunneling ====
In some deployments, the rule set will route DNS requests from clients to the Internet, or the provided DNS server will fulfill arbitrary DNS requests from the client. This allows a client to bypass the captive portal and access the open Internet by tunneling arbitrary traffic within DNS packets.

==== Automatic submission ====
Some captive portals may be configured to allow appropriately equipped user agents to detect the captive portal and automatically authenticate. User agents and supplemental applications such as Apple&#x27;s Captive Portal Assistant can sometimes transparently bypass the display of captive portal content against the wishes of the service operator as long as they have access to correct credentials, or they may attempt to authenticate with incorrect or obsolete credentials, resulting in unintentional consequences such as accidental account locking.

==== MAC spoofing ====
A captive portal that uses MAC addresses to track connected devices can sometimes be circumvented by re-using the MAC address of a previously authenticated device. Once a device has been authenticated to the captive portal using valid credentials, the gateway adds that device&#x27;s MAC address to its allowlist; since MAC addresses can easily be spoofed, any other device can pretend to be the authenticated device and bypass the captive portal. Once the IP and MAC addresses of other connecting computers are found to be authenticated, any machine can spoof the MAC address and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the authenticated target, and be allowed a route through the gateway. For this reason some captive portal solutions created extended authentication mechanisms to limit the risk for usurpation.

=== Require web browser ===
Captive portals often require the use of a web browser; users who first use an email client or other application that relies on the Internet may find the connection not working without explanation, and will then need to open a web browser to validate. This may be problematic for users who do not have any web browser installed on their operating system. It is however sometimes possible to use email and other facilities that do not rely on DNS (e.g. if the application specifies the connection IP address rather than the hostname). A similar problem can occur if the client uses AJAX or joins the network with pages already loaded into its web browser, causing undefined behavior (for example, corrupt messages appear) when such a page tries HTTP requests to its origin server. 

Similarly, as HTTPS connections cannot be redirected (at least not without triggering security warnings), a web browser that only attempts to access secure websites before being authorized by the captive portal will see those attempts fail without explanation (the usual symptom is that the intended website appears to be down or inaccessible).

Platforms that have Wi-Fi and a TCP/IP stack but do not have a web browser that supports HTTPS cannot use many captive portals. Such platforms include the Nintendo DS running a game that uses Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Non-browser authentication is possible using WISPr, an XML-based authentication protocol for this purpose, or MAC-based authentication or authentications based on other protocols.

It is also possible for a platform vendor to enter into a service contract with the operator of a large number of captive portal hotspots to allow free or discounted access to the platform vendor&#x27;s servers via the hotspot&#x27;s walled garden. For example, in 2005 Nintendo and Wayport partnered to provide free Wi-Fi access to Nintendo DS users at certain McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. Also, VoIP and SIP ports could be allowed to bypass the gateway to allow phones to make and receive calls.

<doc id="536557" wikidata="Q423981" url="?curid=536557" title="Melanocyte-stimulating hormone">
<text>The melanocyte-stimulating hormones, known collectively as MSH, also known as melanotropins or intermedins, are a family of peptide hormones and neuropeptides consisting of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (β-MSH), and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ-MSH) that are produced by cells in the pars intermedia of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.

Synthetic analogues of α-MSH, such as afamelanotide (melanotan I; Scenesse), melanotan II, and bremelanotide (PT-141), have been developed and researched.

==Biosynthesis==
The various forms of MSH are generated from different cleavages of the proopiomelanocortin protein, which also yields other important neuropeptides like adrenocorticotropic hormone. 

Melanocytes in skin make and secrete MSH in response to ultraviolet light, where it increases synthesis of melanin. Some neurons in arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus make and secrete α-MSH in response to leptin; α-MSH is also made and secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.

== Function ==
Acting through melanocortin 1 receptor, α-MSH stimulates the production and release of melanin (a process referred to as melanogenesis) by melanocytes in skin and hair.

Acting in the hypothalamus, α-MSH suppresses appetite. α-MSH secreted in the hypothalamus also contributes to sexual arousal.

===In amphibians===
In some animals (such as the claw-toed frog &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;) production of MSH is increased when the animal is in a dark location. This causes pigment to be dispersed in pigment cells in the toad&#x27;s skin, making it become darker, and harder for predators to spot. The pigment cells are called melanophores and therefore, in amphibians, the hormone is often called melanophore-stimulating hormone.

===In humans===

An increase in MSH will cause darker skin in humans too. Pigmentation increases in humans during pregnancy; though the exact endocrine cause is not known, α- and β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone are thought to be involved. Cushing&#x27;s disease due to excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) may also result in hyperpigmentation, such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla. Most people with primary Addison&#x27;s disease have darkening (hyperpigmentation) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun; characteristic sites are skin creases (e.g. of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa), new scars become hyperpigmented, whereas older ones do not darken. This occurs because MSH and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC).

Different levels of MSH are not the major cause of variation in skin colour. However, in many red-headed people, and other people who do not tan well, there are variations in their hormone receptors, causing them to not respond to MSH in the blood.

==Structure of MSH==

The different forms of MSH belong to a group called the melanocortins. This group includes ACTH, α-MSH, β-MSH, and γ-MSH; these peptides are all cleavage products of a large precursor peptide called proopiomelanocortin (POMC). α-MSH is the most important melanocortin for pigmentation.

The different forms of MSH have the following amino acid sequences:

==Synthetic MSH==
Synthetic analogues of α-MSH have been developed for human use. Two of the better known are afamelanotide (melanotan I) in testing by Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals and bremelanotide by Palatin Technologies. Others include modimelanotide and setmelanotide.

* Afamelanotide (brand name Scenesse) has been approved for the treatment of erythropoietic protoporphyria in Europe and is also being investigated as a method of photoprotection in the treatment of polymorphous light eruption, actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma (a form of skin cancer).
* An additional analogue called melanotan II causes enhanced libido and erections in most male test subjects and arousal with corresponding genital involvement in most female test subjects. Bremelanotide (formerly PT-141) which stemmed from melanotan II research is currently under development for its aphrodisiac effects. These effects are mediated by actions in the hypothalamus on neurons that express MC3 and MC4 receptors.

<text>The Pacific Bell Telephone Company (Pac Bell) is a telephone company that provides telephone service in California. The company is owned by AT&amp;T through AT&amp;T Teleholdings, and, though separate, is now marketed as “AT&amp;T”. The company has been known by a number of names during which its service area has changed. The formal name of the company from the 1910s through the 1984 Bell System divestiture was The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. The “Pacific Bell” was phased out of public use in 2002, although it remains the legal name of AT&amp;T&#x27;s local operating company in California and is still the holder of record for the infrastructure of cables and fiber through much of California.

== History ==

The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, or &quot;PacTel&quot; for short, managed the Bell System&#x27;s telephone operations in California. It grew by acquiring smaller telephone companies along the Pacific coast. It built and occupied San Francisco&#x27;s Pacific Telephone Building on New Montgomery Street which has been described as a &quot;monument to western progress and foresight&quot;.

=== San Francisco graft ===
During the San Francisco graft trials, the company was implicated in paying bribes to obtain an operations franchise in San Francisco. Theodore Halsey, a confidential political agent for the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, paid attorney Abe Ruef a retainer of $1,250 a month for &quot;advice&quot; on municipal issues. Ruef was the political boss behind S.F. Mayor Eugene Schmitz. In 1906, San Francisco was one of the most promising places for investment in all of the United States. Many companies were vying for a piece of the money to be made. The city&#x27;s supervisors had run on a platform that included the city acquiring its own telephone system which both Home Telephone Company and Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company wanted to prevent. The Home Telephone Company, financed by investors from Southern California and Ohio, was trying to wrest the telephone franchise held exclusively by Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company in Northern California.

After the massive earthquake of 1906, the Home Telephone Company contributed $75,000 to a relief fund for the city, but asked that it be held until their franchise was approved. It was later revealed that the city&#x27;s supervisors had received payoffs through Ruef from both the Home Telephone Company and Pacific States Telephone Co. Home Telephone paid 10 supervisors $3,500 each and seven supervisors $6,000 each (about $ to $ in 2025). Pacific States Telephone Co. paid 10 supervisors $5,000 each ($ today). After the graft prosecutions, E.F. Pillsbury, General Counsel for the telephone company, revealed that he had never heard of Ruef&#x27;s employment, and would have objected to Ruef receiving compensation greater than his own $1,000 per month.

=== Growth ===
During the first part of the 20th century, Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph, along with the rest of the Bell System, initially resisted automating its services, on the premise that their people could provide better service than machines. When it acquired competing providers, if the company provided automatic dial service, Bell removed the automatic equipment and replaced it with manual telephones and manual operator switchboards. The company soon realized its best manual systems were unable to keep up with the growing demand for telephone service. In the early 1920s, following the 1921 installation of the nation&#x27;s first large panel switch in Omaha, the Bell operating companies began to install automated switching equipment.

=== Southern California service ===

Los Angeles and San Francisco employed different approaches for adopting new automatic switching technology. The Los Angeles Telephone Co. had merged with the Sunset Telephone Co. of northern California in 1883. Sunset was subsequently acquired by Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. in 1906. Following the purchase by PacTel, the southern California company remained a separate operation and used the Sunset name.

The Los Angeles area was also served by a competitor, The Home Telephone Co., which began offering automatic (dial) service in 1902. The Sunset Telephone Co. subscribers were able to make local and long-distance calls via the Bell System, but Home Telephone Co. customers could make only local calls to other Home customers. To reach both exchanges, businesses were required to pay for a line from each company. In 1916, under pressure from local politicians and subscribers, Sunset Telephone Co. agreed to acquire the Home Company&#x27;s operations. The new entity was called The Southern California Telephone Co. The two companies&#x27; operations were fully integrated in 1918.

At the time of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 customers served from 16 dial offices. Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home&#x27;s operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn&#x27;t convert the dial offices to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.

The last Los Angeles manual exchange was Thornwall 6, in Burbank, which operated until the late 1950s. The last manual office in southern California was in Avalon, on Catalina Island, dating from a radiotelephone service installed in the early 1920s. Pacific Telephone later laid two submarine cables to link the island to the mainland. Avalon was converted to dial in 1978, using switching equipment 23 miles away in the San Pedro central office.

=== Northern California operations ===

San Francisco continued to install manual offices throughout the 1920s. When PacTel took over the operations of its San Francisco and Oakland competitor, Home Telephone Co., in the early 1920s, their customers were switched from Home&#x27;s dial service to Pacific Telephone manual exchanges. A 1927 Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. publication proudly describes the company&#x27;s newest manual offices, without a word of plans to introduce dial service. San Francisco&#x27;s first dial office, ORdway, opened on March 23, 1929. The first suburban step-by-step (electromechanical stepping switch) office opened in Palo Alto in 1929.

=== Dial service conversion ===
Telephone service conversion from manual to dial systems was slowed by equipment shortages during World War II. San Jose had been planned for conversion before the war, but remained on manual service until 1949. 

In preparation for Operator Toll Dialing, the precursor to customer DDD (Direct Distance Dialling), cities throughout the country converted telephone numbers to a standardized 2L-5N format, e.g. EXchange . San Francisco completed its conversion in December 1947. In July 1948, Pacific Telephone converted most of the cities on the San Francisco Peninsula. The company announcement, &quot;most Peninsula cities now have exchange names&quot; confirmed that the old four- or five-digit numbers had been converted to the seven-digit exchange format.

* DAvenport 2 - Palo Alto
* OXford - Millbrae
* DIamond 3 &amp; 4 - Burlingame, San Mateo
* FIreside 5 - San Mateo
* EMerson 6 - Redwood City

Manual numbers were still used in some peninsula cities and were listed in the directory without the first two letters of the name capitalized, indicating a non-dialable point requiring operator assistance to reach. For example:
* Belmont 120
* San Carlos 932-J
* Pescadero 2349-R
* Half Moon Bay 3497
* San Gregorio 2

To place calls to certain other Northern California exchanges, such as Sacramento, Stockton, and Vallejo in Northern California, dial customers would dial &quot;0&quot; to reach an operator. The operator dialed through a tandem switch and directly called numbers in those cities. These calls were indicated by a star in the telephone directory. For other call destinations, customers dialed &quot;211&quot; to reach a long-distance operator, who would connect the customer using manual trunks to reach a distant operator.

When Pacific Telephone converted its San Francisco operations to 2L-5N calling in 1947, the old central office names were kept in most cases, with an extra digit appended. Certain exchanges were abandoned after being converted from manual service, such as WEst, RAndolph, and the famous CHina exchange of Chinatown. The manual 25th Street office in San Francisco, serving the MIssion, ATwater, and VAlencia exchanges, was converted to dial in 1952. On September 6, 1953, JUniper 6, previously known as RAndolph in the 2L-4N era, the last manual office within the City and County, cut over its 2,700 subscribers to crossbar equipment in the new Juniper central office on Onondaga Avenue.

Riverside maintained a large manual office until 1956. Berkeley converted AShberry 3, its last manual office, to dial in 1963. Crockett, the final Bay Area manual office, was converted to dial in 1969.

=== Northwest acquisitions ===
Acquisitions over the years extended Pacific Telephone&#x27;s territory into Oregon, Washington, and northern Idaho. Those operations were split off on July 1, 1961, to form Pacific Northwest Bell. In the 1980s, Pacific Telephone&#x27;s assets were valued at $14.5 billion, making it the largest of any of the 22 wholly owned local Bell operating companies of AT&amp;T, which also made Pacific Telephone the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the operating companies. However, Pacific Telephone was one of the least profitable Bells due to very tough local telephone regulations in California.

=== Separation from AT&amp;T ===

Prior to the AT&amp;T breakup in 1984, AT&amp;T held 89.8% of Pacific Telephone. After the breakup, The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company changed its name to Pacific Bell Telephone Company, or PacBell for short. Pacific Telesis was formed as a holding company for PacBell&#x27;s interests, with PacBell and Nevada Bell (which PacBell had owned since 1913) as its operating companies. Since Nevada Bell had long been a PacBell subsidiary, that company was omitted from the Modification of Final Judgment that broke up the Bell System.

== Mergers and subsequent growth ==
In 1997, Pacific Telesis Group was acquired by SBC Communications, and although the Pacific Telesis corporate name disappeared fairly quickly with many reported family shareholders selling and converting major equity stakes, SBC continued to operate the local telephone companies separately under their original names.
In September 2001, SBC rebranded the telephone company &quot;SBC Pacific Bell&quot;. In late 2002, the companies were rebranded again as &quot;SBC&quot;. Meanwhile, employees of SBC working in California who support SBC&#x27;s non-regulated services and/or services provided both within and outside California were transferred to other SBC subsidiaries, like &quot;Pacific Telesis Shared Services&quot; and &quot;SBC Operations, Inc.&quot; However, for legal and regulatory purposes, employees supporting local regulated services were still employed by &quot;Pacific Bell Telephone Company dba SBC California (&quot;SBC California&quot;)&quot; which is the SBC subsidiary that provides regulated local exchange carrier telephone services within the franchise territory in California.
On November 18, 2005, SBC completed its acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp. to form AT&amp;T Inc. Pacific Bell is now known as &quot;Pacific Bell Telephone Company&quot;, dba AT&amp;T California. In 2006, the company&#x27;s direct parent, originally Ameritech, became AT&amp;T Teleholdings due to an internal reorganization at AT&amp;T. Its former direct parent, Pacific Telesis Group, was legally merged into AT&amp;T Teleholdings, while a majority of the original Bell family shares were sold. In 2007, local telephone service in California was further deregulated, resulting in price increases for AT&amp;T California customers.

<doc id="536580" wikidata="Q5283127" url="?curid=536580" title="Distributed Sender Blackhole List">
<text>The Distributed Sender Blackhole List was a Domain Name System-based Blackhole List that listed IP addresses of insecure e-mail hosts. DSBL could be used by server administrators to tag or block e-mail messages that came from insecure servers, which is often spam.

The DSBL published its lists as domain name system (DNS) zones that could be queried by anyone on the Internet.

DSBL is a dead RBL as of May 2008. Its administrators continued to run their authoritative nameservers for several months after their decommissioning announcement; as of March 9, 2009, even those servers are offline. At this point, using any *.dsbl.org lookups in an RBL check results in DNS failures and can even prevent an SMTP server from starting a conversation.

== Blocking ==
It is not possible for DSBL to block or intercept mail. E-mail is sometimes blocked or bounced with a message referencing DSBL. These messages were not blocked by DSBL; they were blocked by the administrator of the &quot;receiving&quot; mail server, who chose to reject messages coming from a potentially-insecure IP address listed by DSBL. See DNSBL for a description of how mail transfer agents interact with these lists.

== Methodology ==
DSBL lists IP addresses of hosts that are demonstrated to be insecure. DSBL defines an insecure host as one that allows e-mail to be sent from anyone to anyone else. Normal servers only send mail from their own users to anyone else. Insecure servers are commonly abused by spammers, although DSBL does not claim that the hosts have sent spam or have been abused by spammers; only that they could be.

DSBL builds its lists by receiving specially-formatted &quot;listme&quot; e-mails triggered by testers. DSBL itself does not test hosts for security vulnerabilities. The testers use software that causes insecure servers to send a message to an e-mail address monitored by DSBL. The message includes a time-sensitive cryptographically secure cookie to prevent servers from being listed by mistake. When a valid listme message is received DSBL adds the IP address of the server that delivered the message to one of its lists.

For these messages to reach DSBL the insecure server must have allowed anyone (a DSBL tester) to send mail to anyone (DSBL&#x27;s monitored address). This proof-of-vulnerability is kept on file at DSBL&#x27;s web site.

In addition to open mail relays, DSBL lists hosts that were vulnerable to abuse due to formmail bugs, open proxies, and other problems. Because the testers can use any available method to trigger the listme messages, they can adapt to newly discovered vulnerabilities as spammers do.

The testers normally perform tests on hosts that have sent spam to them. Thus many of the IP addresses listed by DSBL are the addresses of servers that have been abused by spammers.

== Delisting ==
For an IP address to be removed from DSBL&#x27;s lists, the administrator of the IP address must demonstrate &quot;accountability&quot; by first requesting, and then responding, to a delisting message from DSBL. The message can only be sent to the postmaster or abuse desk of the listed IP address. The postmaster&#x27;s e-mail domain is determined by consulting reverse DNS.

Until this accountability test is passed, the host remains listed. Thus it is possible that some of the IP addresses listed by DSBL have been secured, but are still listed because the administrator has not demonstrated accountability by requesting and responding to a de-listing message.

Because DSBL does not perform vulnerability tests, the only criterion for removal is this accountability test. It is entirely possible that hosts that are delisted are still vulnerable to abuse. If this is the case, it is expected that the host will be relisted by a tester the next time it is abused.

The problem with the delisting process is that dynamic dial-up IP-addresses which make it to the list will never be delisted since delisting would require to run an SMTP-server in the temporary dial-up IP. Another problem is that they require the SMTP server to be running behind a router that allows packets marked with the ECN bits. This may require an upgrade to the newest router software before the accountability email can be received.

== Automated system and credibility ==
DSBL is a largely automated system. The delisting process, in particular, is an automated self-service web page. Manual processes are not used to remove an IP address from the list, except in rare cases where a bug in DSBL&#x27;s software prevented a delisting. DSBL&#x27;s operators believe that manual delisting processes would undermine the list&#x27;s credibility.

== Lists ==
DSBL operated three lists:

* unconfirmed.dsbl.org: The unconfirmed list contains IP addresses of hosts that have delivered listme messages triggered by anonymous or untrusted testers. DSBL does not recommend using this list as part of a blocking system.
* list.dsbl.org: The trusted list contains IP addresses of hosts that have delivered listme messages triggered by trusted testers.
* multihop.dsbl.org: The multihop list contains IP addresses of hosts that deliver mail for insecure servers. The servers in this list may appear to be secure, but can be abused by spammers because they trust other servers that are insecure. This category sometimes includes the mail servers of large ISPs, and DSBL recommends using this list as part of a message scoring system, not as a blocking list.

<doc id="536586" wikidata="Q1373504" url="?curid=536586" title="The Adventure of the Lion's Mane">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; (1926), one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It is notable for being narrated by Holmes himself, instead of by Dr. Watson (who does not appear in the story).

==Plot==

In 1907, some time after his retirement to the Sussex Downs, Holmes goes for a walk and meets his friend Harold Stackhurst, headmaster of a local preparatory school called &quot;The Gables&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Stackhurst&#x27;s science teacher, Fitzroy McPherson, staggers up from the nearby beach, dressed in only his overcoat and trousers. He collapses at their feet, and dies shortly thereafter, having managed to scream the words &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;. He has long, narrow welts curving around his body; he appears to have been repeatedly whipped with some sort of thin, flexible scourge, until his weak heart gave out with the pain.

Ian Murdoch, the morose mathematics teacher at the Gables, arrives on the scene, having just finished teaching an algebra class. Holmes sends him to find the police, then examines the nearby bathing pool, which had been created by unusually high tides after a recent series of gales from the south. Holmes finds McPherson&#x27;s dry, folded towel, and concludes he had not yet been in the water. There are people far down the beach, and some fishing boats out at sea, but none are close enough to have had anything to do with the tragedy. The police arrive, but a search of the surrounding caves reveals no clues.

Ian Murdoch, due to his temper, is a possible suspect; he once threw McPherson&#x27;s Airedale terrier through a window. However, Stackhurst insists the two men were friends. A note in McPherson&#x27;s pocket suggests someone named &quot;Maudie&quot; had an appointment to meet him, so Stackhurst and Holmes go to the house of Maud Bellamy, the daughter of a wealthy sailor-turned-businessman. As they arrive, Murdoch passes them, having just left Maud&#x27;s house. When Murdoch refuses to tell Stackhurst what he was doing there, the conversation escalates into a sharp argument, and Stackhurst gives Murdoch notice. Inside the house, Maud&#x27;s unpleasant father and brother reveal that they both disliked McPherson as being below their station. However, Maud explains that she and McPherson were secretly engaged, and often agreed to meet in private. She also admits that Murdoch is a former admirer of hers, causing Holmes and Stackhurst to believe he may have killed McPherson out of jealousy. 
Days later, the inquest is adjourned due to lack of evidence. Murdoch&#x27;s rooms are searched, in vain. Later, McPherson&#x27;s dog is found dead on the same beach its master died on, a look of extreme pain on its face. This, and the memory of the dying man&#x27;s last words, triggers Holmes to start a new line of inquiry, and he begins to dig through his old books. Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabulary visits, and asks if he should arrest Murdoch, but Holmes points out that Murdoch has an alibi. Suddenly, Murdoch and Stackhurst burst in, the former in great pain and with his torso covered in the same curving welts McPherson had. After treating Murdoch with brandy, and applying salad oil to the wounds, Holmes leads Stackhurst and Bardle back to the bathing pool. After some intense searching, he finds what he was looking for; a &quot;Cyanea capillata&quot;, or lion&#x27;s-mane jellyfish, which has been washed into the pool by the recent gales. The three men promptly crush it beneath a boulder, killing it.

Murdoch, once recovered, explains that he was swimming when the creature stung him, though he only felt it and did not see it. Being a man in normal health, he has survived the encounter. Holmes shows the group a book by
John George Wood, detailing the author&#x27;s own painful encounter with a &quot;Cyanea&quot;. The book&#x27;s accurate description of the jellyfish stings had put Holmes on the right trail; he had initially failed to consider a sea creature the culprit, because he had mistakenly assumed McPherson never entered the water. In reality, McPherson had simply been in too much pain to towel himself. The dog, pining and looking for its dead master, had entered the pool, and unintentionally shared McPherson&#x27;s fate. 

Murdoch explains that, while he had feelings for Maud, he had never acted on them, out of respect for his friend McPherson. Murdoch was, in fact, the secret deliverer of all the messages between his friend and Maud. Stackhurst and Murdoch make up their quarrel, and leave the cottage arm in arm.

==Commentary==
This is one of only two stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to be narrated by Sherlock Holmes himself instead of Dr Watson. The other story is &quot;The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier&quot;.

According to Owen Dudley Edwards, the original manuscript of the story indicates that Doyle initially planned to have Holmes chronicle his own defeat. The solution to the case given by Holmes in the final version was originally provided by a naturalist called Dr Mordhouse. This aspect was ultimately removed and Dr Mordhouse does not appear in the final version.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in November 1926, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1926. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Liberty&quot;, and with three illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

A facsimile of the original manuscript was published in 1992 by Westminster Libraries and The Sherlock Holmes Society of London.

==Adaptations==
===Radio and audio dramas===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser in 1931 as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 23 March 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another dramatisation of the story adapted by Meiser aired on 1 August 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as episodes of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 13 November 1939 and 25 January 1942 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson). In an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; that aired on 21 April 1947, Tom Conway played Holmes with Bruce as Watson.

A radio adaptation of the story aired in 1969 on BBC Radio 2, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr Watson. It was dramatised by Michael Hardwick.

&quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.

In 2009, the story was adapted for radio as part of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Television===
&quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; was indirectly referenced in the BBC adaptation &quot;Sherlock&quot; in &quot;The Six Thatchers&quot;, where Sherlock and John, while solving cases, jokingly comment on the stupidity of arresting a jellyfish. In the CBS adaptation &quot;Elementary&quot;, in the introduction of &quot;The Geek Interpreter&quot;, Sherlock briefly reports solving the 1926 cold case death of Fitzroy McPherson, identifying the Lion&#x27;s Mane jellyfish as the culprit.

<doc id="536591" wikidata="Q1633472" url="?curid=536591" title="North American fraternity and sorority housing">
<text>North American fraternity and sorority housing refers largely to the houses or housing areas in which fraternity and sorority members live and work together. In addition to serving as housing, fraternity and sorority housing may also serve to host social gatherings, meetings, and functions that benefit the community.

== History ==
The first fraternity house seems to have been located at Alpha Epsilon of Chi Psi at the University of Michigan around 1846. As fraternity membership was punishable by expulsion at many colleges at this time, the house was located deep in the woods.

Fraternity chapter housing initially existed in two forms: lodges that served as meeting rooms and houses that had boarding rooms. The lodges came first and were largely replaced by houses with living accommodations. Lodges were often no more than rented rooms above stores or taverns. The idea of substantial fraternity housing caught on quickly, but was accomplished with much greater ease in the North as southern college students had far less available money for construction.
The first fraternity house in the South was likely one rented by members of Beta Theta Pi at Hampden–Sydney College from at least 1856. Alpha Tau Omega was then the first fraternity to own a house in the South when, in 1880, its chapter at acquired one.

Early chapters of women&#x27;s fraternities often rented houses where they could live together, usually with a chaperone. This was in a day before colleges and universities had housing available. The first chapter house built by a women&#x27;s fraternity was the one Alpha Phi erected at Syracuse University in 1886.

Many colleges eventually came to support fraternity and sorority housing as they allowed increased enrollment without the construction of costly dormitories. The nature of this benefit varied between campuses as some houses were paid for entirely by alumni, some were rented, and some were built on land leased from the college. It was further recognized that, while fraternities having chapter houses did not raise academic performance, it did tend to keep it from falling as the chapters could not afford (financially) to have members leaving school and no longer paying for their rooms.

The Inter-Sorority Congress of 1913 saw the establishment of uniform rules and regulations regarding life in chapter houses. The number of houses owned by fraternities and sororities grew from 772 in 1915 to 928 in 1920.

==Design==

Fraternity and sorority houses range in size from three to twenty bedrooms or more. They can usually be identified by large Greek letters or flags on the front of the house. The larger chapter houses generally have a large meeting room, a large dining room, a commercial kitchen, and a study room. There is usually a lounge of some sort, access to which is often restricted to fully initiated members. Fraternities and sororities will also often maintain a chapter room, to which only initiates may ever be admitted and even whose existence may be kept secret. The walls of the house may be decorated with pictures of past chapter events, awards, and trophies, decorative (or historic) paddles, or composite photos of members from past years.

In some fraternities or sororities, only the representatives live in the houses while in others the entire fraternity or sorority may live in the house. Other, larger fraternities or sororities may have more than one house to accommodate all of its members.

At many colleges, Greek houses are placed on the same street which is traditionally referred to as &quot;Greek Row.&quot;

==Policies==
Fraternity and sorority houses are typically owned either by a corporation of alumni, the sponsoring national organization, or the host college. For this reason, such houses may be subject to the rules of the host college, the national organization, or both.

Due to the increase in widely publicized alcohol-related deaths on college campuses, many national organizations and host colleges have implemented dry housing policies in which the consumption and possession of alcohol are prohibited on house property. Some colleges make this policy conditional on overall grade performance.

In addition to banning alcohol, many university-owned fraternity and sorority houses have smoking bans in place inside. Because of residential requirements, some college campuses and national chapter administrations also prohibit members of the opposite sex on certain floors of fraternity and sorority houses.

Founded in 2017, the Fraternal Housing Association is a national membership that supports the unique challenges of managing fraternity and sorority housing.

==National Register chapter houses==
The following chapter houses are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Demolished structures are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;.

<doc id="536617" wikidata="Q302155" url="?curid=536617" title="Bleeding Through">
<text>Bleeding Through is an American metalcore band from Orange County, California, formed in 1999. Influenced largely by hardcore punk and Swedish melodic death metal, the band was established by lead vocalist Brandan Schieppati as a personal project after leaving Throwdown. Schieppati, who also was a member of Eighteen Visions, originally balanced playing with Eighteen Visions and Bleeding Through, recording the independent albums &quot;Dust to Ashes&quot; (2001) and &quot;Portrait of the Goddess&quot; (2002) before departing Eighteen Visions to focus on Bleeding Through. The remainder of the band today comprises drummer Derek Youngsma, keyboardist Marta Demmel, and guitarists John Arnold and Brandon Richter. As of 2024, the band have sold more than 400,000 albums worldwide.

In 2003, Bleeding Through signed with Trustkill Records and released their breakthrough album, &quot;This Is Love, This Is Murderous&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the band receceived considerable media attention outside of the heavy metal community for their involvement in a van crash accidentally filmed on live television in December 2003. &quot;This Love&quot; was critically lauded and was followed by &quot;The Truth&quot; (2006) and &quot;Declaration&quot; (2008), both through Trustkill.

The release of &quot;Declaration&quot; was marred by financial hardship and conflicts with Trustkill; following the completion of the touring cycle for the album, the band severed ties with the label and signed to Rise Records in 2009. They released two albums through Rise, &quot;Bleeding Through&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Great Fire&quot; (2012), before the group disbanded in 2014. They remained inactive for three years before reuniting in 2017, releasing &quot;Love Will Kill All&quot; (2018) through SharpTone Records. The band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Nine&quot;, was released on February 14, 2025.

== History ==

=== &quot;Dust to Ashes&quot; and &quot;Portrait of the Goddess&quot; (1999–2002) ===
Bleeding Through, a band from Orange County, California, traces its origins back to 1998, when a hardcore punk band named Breakneck was founded by vocalist Brandan Schieppati and guitarist Javier Van Huss, then both of Eighteen Visions. Completing the lineup were guitarist Scott Danough, bass guitarist Chad Tafolla, and drummer Troy Born. Van Huss and Schieppati had also both played guitar in the Orange County band Throwdown. Breakneck played only one live performance, opening for Throwdown, Eighteen Visions, and Adamantium among others. Schieppati, who had replaced Van Huss in Throwdown and was still playing guitar for them at the time of Breakneck&#x27;s show on top of Eighteen Visions, left Throwdown to focus on fronting his own group after the Breakneck show. Established as a hardcore punk act, Breakneck subsequently began to explore a more metallic musical direction. Eventually, this led the members to feel it necessary to change their band name. The origin of the band&#x27;s name was explained in an interview as follows: &quot;Well, it is summed up by the explanation that whether black, white, red, brown, yellow, religious preference, straight or gay, we all bleed the same, and we bleed through this life the same. Thus Bleeding Through.&quot;

The band undertook many lineup changes in its early days. Van Huss was the first departure; he was briefly replaced by Dave Peters, after which Tafolla switched from playing bass to guitar. The vacant bass position was temporarily replaced by Brandon Conway; Marc Jackson was recruited as the next permanent bassist. Jackson and Danough had previously played in the band Refuge together in the early 1990s. Jackson quit the band before the band began recording their debut album, and added Vijay Kumar as the band&#x27;s new bassist. The band also established a keyboardist in Molly Street. The band&#x27;s first album began as a demo comprising five songs using a 4-track recorder in Born&#x27;s bedroom. At the beginning of the following year, Born left the band, followed the next month by Kumar. Despite these losses, the band released their debut album, &quot;Dust to Ashes&quot;, on March 25, 2001 through Prime Directive Records. Kumar later reversed course and returned to the band, and Born was quickly replaced by Derek Youngsma, who had previously played with Danough in a band called Daggers.

The band signed a two-album and one-EP contract with Indecision Records in April 2001, less than a month after the release of &quot;Dust to Ashes&quot;. In August 2001, following the band&#x27;s first tour, Tafolla left the band and was replaced by Brian Leppke. After completing a tour of the American West Coast with From Autumn to Ashes, the band entered a studio to begin recording their new album around December, with a tour between recording sessions accompanying Throwdown from late December into early January. The record, titled &quot;Portrait of the Goddess&quot;, was completed in early March 2002, and it was released on April 13. A few days later, Kumar left the group for good, and was replaced by Eighteen Visions&#x27; Mick Morris the following month. The band then joined Every Time I Die and Norma Jean for a six-week tour spanning late may through early July, though the band were forced to withdraw from several of the July shows after Schieppati was injured after a show in Newport Beach, California. The band would go on to play at Hellfest later that year. Schieppati opted to pursue Bleeding Through as a priority after completion of &quot;Portrait of the Goddess&quot;, amicably departing Eighteen Visions in July, followed by Street&#x27;s replacement with Marta Demmel (then Peterson). Morris eventually returned to Eighteen Visions later that year, and his role in Bleeding Through was filled by Ryan Wombacher.

=== &quot;This Is Love, This Is Murderous&quot; (2003–2005) ===

After these two relatively under-distributed albums, Bleeding Through signed to a larger label, Trustkill Records, in 2003. Their third full-length album, the Ulrich Wild-produced &quot;This is Love, This is Murderous&quot;, was released that September, to generally favorable reviews from critics. It was the band&#x27;s breakthough album, with the videos for &quot;Love Lost in a Hail of Gun Fire&quot; and &quot;On Wings of Lead&quot; becoming staples on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and on Fuse TV&#x27;s &quot;Uranium&quot;. 

The band embarked upon tours across the United States, first opening for AFI, followed by the ill-fated Pure Hatred tour with Chimaira, Soilwork and As I Lay Dying. These dates had propelled the band to national attention not because of the initial reception of their music, but because of an accident captured by live television crews which happened to involve the band. Traveling from Utah to a show in Colorado, the group&#x27;s tour van hit black ice on the highway, spinning out of control and slamming into a truck that was already flipped over. A mobile TV unit reporting for Salt Lake City&#x27;s KSL-TV was present to report on another crash, but ended up catching the band&#x27;s collision on film as their equipment trailer rolled and exploded, showering their instruments and gear across the road. The band escaped with only minor injuries; however, with their gear and vehicle destroyed, the group was forced to drop off the tour. The dramatic televised footage was broadcast everywhere from CNN&#x27;s Headline News, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, NBC News and even The Weather Channel.

The band began 2004 with the Mutilation Tour, which culminated in a sold-out homecoming performance at The Glasshouse in Orange County. This date was captured on a live DVD, titled &quot;This Is Live, This Is Murderous&quot;. Later that year, the band toured with Ozzfest, sharing the second stage alongside headline act Slipknot and fellow supports Unearth, Lamb of God, Every Time I Die, Hatebreed, Lacuna Coil and Atreyu. They earned the direct support position on MTV2&#x27;s third Headbangers Ball: The Tour in November, featuring Cradle of Filth, Arch Enemy and Himsa as touring partners. Bleeding Through also contributed their rendition of &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; to the Guns N&#x27; Roses tribute album &quot;Bring You to Your Knees&quot; released by Law of Inertia Records in 2004. A 2005 re-issue of &quot;This Is Love, This Is Murderous&quot; added three bonus live tracks, &quot;Revenge I Seek&quot;, &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Our Enemies&quot;, two music videos and a ten-minute documentary. Following this, the band embarked upon a European tour in February 2005, supported by Cult of Luna.

=== &quot;The Truth&quot; (2005–2007)===

In April, the group entered Cherokee Studios with producer and then-Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano. Together, they began work on a new album titled &quot;The Truth&quot;. As &quot;This Is Love, This Is Murderous&quot; passed 100,000 sales the US, further touring found the band headlining the second annual Strhess Fest in alliance with Darkest Hour, Zao, Misery Signals, and Fight Paris commencing early July. Upon completion of these gigs the group joined the Warped Tour for a two-week stretch. November saw shows with Day of Contempt, before the group entered the recording studio to record cover versions of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;My War&quot;, for use on a tribute album, and Unbroken&#x27;s &quot;Fall On Proverb&quot;.

&quot;The Truth&quot; was released on January 10, 2006, through Trustkill. The band decided to rebuild their sound from the ground up; Danough told &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that the band&#x27;s approach involved &quot;Taking out the Metalcore, and then adding the metal into hardcore, if that makes any sense,&quot; while Leppke added, &quot;I don&#x27;t think this album sounds like anything else out there right now. We&#x27;re very proud of that fact.&quot; The album sold 17,000 copies in its first week to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 48, and No. 1 on the Top Independent Albums. To promote the album, the band opened 2006 with US dates throughout February and March backed by Every Time I Die, Between the Buried and Me and Haste the Day. The band also put in a significant appearance on the second stage at the UK&#x27;s Download Festival in Castle Donington on June 9. On July 18, Bleeding Through appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Stand-up comedian Mitch Fatel joined the band for a song.

The group once again played on the second stage at the 2006 Ozzfest, now as part of the year&#x27;s permanent lineup along with Black Label Society, Unearth, Atreyu and Norma Jean. During days Ozzfest was not performing, Bleeding Through played shows supporting Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold and Hatebreed. The band members were on a day off from the festival passing through Medford, Oregon, when they pulled into a Taco Bell parking lot to eat. This resulted in a fan recognizing them and then calling over a bunch of his friends. The band talked with the fans, signed autographs, posed for pictures and also asked the kids if there were any shows happening that night they could participate in. They ended up doing a small club concert with local bands, with roughly 150 people in attendance. The show was a benefit with all proceeds going toward cancer research. The band spent November and December 2006 on tour with Saosin and Senses Fail.

Bleeding Through headlined the Darkness Over Europe 2007 Tour with I Killed The Prom Queen, All Shall Perish, and Caliban from February to March. It would be Danough&#x27;s final tour with the band, as the two parties agreed to mutually part ways in April. According to a statement released by the band, Danough and the other members &quot;had grown apart and it was time for both parties to move on&quot;. Danough was quickly replaced by Jona Weinhofen of I Killed The Prom Queen – one of several factors that led that band to disband. The band then toured as the opening act for the Slayer and Marilyn Manson summer tour.
Following that, the group embarked on a six-week stint across the North America opening for HIM, finishing the touring cycle for &quot;The Truth&quot; on December 1 and 2, 2007.

=== &quot;Declaration&quot; and record label issues (2008–2009) ===
In March 2008, Bleeding Through announced &quot;Declaration&quot; as the title of its fifth studio release, a concept album about the rigors of being away from home. The band&#x27;s frontman and lyricist Brandan Schieppati explained to &quot;Revolver&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s May 2008 issue, &quot;There are definitely places when we&#x27;re traveling where every time we go there, we&#x27;re like, &#x27;Fuck, why do we have to be here?&#x27; Like, we&#x27;ll be in France and all of a sudden we&#x27;ll feel totally insignificant. You get the feeling that people&#x27;s eyes are just burning a hole through you.&quot; The group recorded &quot;Declaration&quot; in Vancouver with producer Devin Townsend.

On June 6, 2008, the band released a blog on MTV&#x27;s Headbangers Ball website, addressing numerous disappointments the band had with Trustkill Records. These disappointments included unpaid royalties, lack of funding for &quot;Declaration&quot;, and an unapproved re-release of &quot;The Truth&quot; titled &quot;The Complete Truth&quot;. Despite Trustkill&#x27;s website saying that the new album, &quot;Declaration&quot; would be released August 2008, the band stated that they did not intend to hand over the master recording of the album until they were paid the minimum fees required to pay back Townsend, the band&#x27;s management, and Schieppati&#x27;s father who loaned the band money for recording. According to the statement, the band had suggested their own vision of an extended re-release of the album over a year prior, but Trustkill owner Josh Grabelle rejected the idea. However, when Trustkill ran into financial difficulties, Grabelle pushed for the re-release without any input from the band in an effort to stabilize. In a follow-up blog on their MySpace page, Bleeding Through stated that &quot;Trustkill Records delivered the funds necessary to complete the album and to compensate everyone who had loaned [us] cash.&quot; According to Schieppati, Trustkill was only able to deliver these funds because they had borrowed the money from one of their distributors.

Following the recording of &quot;Declaration&quot;, the group returned to the United Kingdom for Download Festival, which was held from June 13–15, 2008 at Donington Park. During the festival, vocalist Brandan Schieppati spoke to &quot;Rock Sound&quot; TV about the group&#x27;s dispute with its record label. During the conversation, Schieppati revealed that Bleeding Through had been contacted by a number of other record companies since the band went public with its Trustkill feud. In July 2008, the band signed a European distribution deal with Nuclear Blast for the release of &quot;Declaration&quot;.

The band performed in the No Fear Music Tour with Bullet for My Valentine across the US in August 2008. This included a stop in Mexico City in August as part of the Warped Tour with Underoath and MxPx, which was Bleeding Through&#x27;s first ever show in Mexico. On September 25, 2008, Machine Head frontman Robb Flynn joined the band on stage at The Warfield in San Francisco, and performed Bleeding Through&#x27;s song &quot;Revenge I Seek&quot;. The next day, &quot;Declaration&quot; was released in Europe by Nuclear Blast, and a US release followed on September 30 through Trustkill. The album sold under 6,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting at number 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band then accompanied Bullet for My Valentine throughout Europe with Lacuna Coil in November and December. The European tour featured four headlining shows in Russia in December, the band&#x27;s first performances there. 

Bleeding Through co-headlined the Thrash and Burn European Tour with Darkest Hour between April and May 2009. By the end of this tour, Bleeding Through had severed ties with Trustkill. &quot;Declaration&quot;″s main promotional tour, simply titled The Declaration Tour, began after Thrash and Burn. Bleeding Through was supported by As Blood Runs Black, Impending Doom, and the Acacia Strain. In late May 2009, Bleeding Through announced that Weinhofen would be leaving the band, and No Use for a Name guitarist Dave Nassie would replace him. Weinhofen cited that while he loved his time in Bleeding Through, he decided that he should leave the band and return home to Australia with his family and friends. The band then embarked on a special tour of the American west coast in August to celebrate their tenth anniversary. They were supported by Carnifex, Miss May I, and Motionless in White. The band intended to conclude 2009 with a tour alongside Satyricon, Toxic Holocaust, and Chthonic in September and October. However, the band were forced to stop touring halfway through their North American trek and return home due to &quot;some personal / family business that must be attended to immediately.&quot; Instead, the band joined Tiger Army on October 31 as a special guest for the closing night of their signature event, Octoberflame.

=== &quot;Bleeding Through&quot; (2009–2010) ===

In early June 2009, Bleeding Through signed a deal with the Portland, Oregon-based independent record label Rise Records. Regarding the band&#x27;s previous dispute with its former label Trustkill, Schieppati said, &quot;We&#x27;re very excited to align with a record label that has so much momentum and is growing when many seem to be faltering, dropping bands and firing employees.&quot; On October 12, 2009, Bleeding Through issued a statement that they would be starting work on a new album in December, with the goal of releasing it in 2010. The self-titled record was recorded at Planet Z Studios with producer Zeuss. It was released by Rise on April 13, 2010 in North America and internationally through Roadrunner Records. Preceded by the release of two songs, &quot;Anti-Hero&quot; and &quot;Breathing in the Wrath&quot;, the album sold 3,700 copies in its first week and debuted at number 143 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

Bleeding Through toured heavily throughout 2010, beginning with dates on the European leg of Machine Head&#x27;s Black Procession Tour alongside Hatebreed and All Shall Perish in January and February. The tour was extended into Japan and Australia, with Crossfaith and Emmure opening the shows in the respective countries. Youngsma did not partake in this leg of the tour, as the birth of his second child was near. His position was filled by Mark Garza, then of the Famine. Bleeding Through followed with their own headlining tour of the US, titled Spring Breakdown, with Born Of Osiris and Sleeping Giant. The tour concluded with an appearance at the California Metalfest fesitval in Pomona, California, on May 16, 2010.

Following the conclusion of Spring Breakdown, the group filmed a music video for the song &quot;Anti-Hero&quot;, released on May 26, 2010. This was followed by a return to Europe supporting the Faceless, including a stop at Graspop Metal Meeting. In August 2010, the group headlined a tour of California with Terror and The Ghost Inside. The following month, they headlined the Anti-Hero Tour across the US with support from For Today and After The Burial. After that, they finished their touring for the year by once again returning to Europe, joining Parkway Drive and Comeback Kid for the Impericon Never Say Die! Tour.

=== &quot;The Great Fire&quot;, disbandment announcement and final tours (2010–2014) ===
In a November 2010 interview, Wombacher stated Bleeding Through hoped to release their seventh album in the second half of 2011. The band planned to write and record their seventh studio album once they returned from touring for the self-titled album. At that point, the band had not yet chosen a recording studio, and they planned to self-produce the album. After recording the album, Nassie stated in an interview that the recording process was much more comfortable than their last effort, describing it as &quot;totally free-form&quot;, adding that &quot;No one was afraid to change something, even down to the last minute. For this record, we were changing things down to the last day of mixing.&quot; He also described it as &quot;our strongest record — super-brutal and over-the-top&quot;. On November 24, 2011, it was announced that their album, &quot;The Great Fire&quot;, was complete, though no release date was stated at that time. Produced by Anaal Nathrakh&#x27;s Mick Kenney, the album was released on January 31, 2012. It was preceded by the release of the song &quot;Faith in Fire&quot; on December 20, 2011, at which point the track listing and cover art was also revealed, followed by the release of &quot;Goodbye to Death&quot; a month later. The album sold 3,000 copies in its first week to debut at number 193 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band supported the album with a six-date headlining tour between January and February 2012 with Upon a Burning Body and Suffokate. The band were due to embark on Demon Hunter&#x27;s &quot;True Defiance 2012&quot; tour of North America alongside Cancer Bats and the Plot in You in July and August 2012, but were forced to drop out due to Schiepatti requiring emergency orthodontic surgery. 

On January 3, 2013, Bleeding Through announced their upcoming tour in Europe would be their last, leading to rumors that the band would be breaking up. This was later confirmed by a statement to &quot;Blabbermouth.net&quot; from Schieppati, who said that they would disband following a final tour of North America, Europe and Australia. Schieppati reasoned that life events and personal ventures by each of the band members made it impossible to continue Bleeding Through. Demmel later elaborated that the band did not want to operate in a &quot;part-time&quot; capacity, and thus opted to put the band to an end. Schieppati would also later expound upon his reasoning for the band&#x27;s split years later, saying that from his perspective, Bleeding Through had lost the respect of the music industry. 

In February 2013, Bleeding Through announced that Danough would return to the band for the European leg of the tour. In November 2013, Bleeding Through embarked on a farewell tour of North America, supported by Winds Of Plague, Oceano, Gideon and Sworn In. En route to the final show of the tour in Albuquerque, New Mexico—and almost ten years to the date of their van accident on the Pure Hatred tour—the band&#x27;s van drove off the road and their trailer was totaled. Despite this, no one was injured and the band&#x27;s performance in the city went ahead as planned. The band&#x27;s first performance in 2014 was an appearance at New England Hardcore &amp; Metal Fest at the Worcester Palladium on April 17; it was the band&#x27;s final performance on the American East Coast. In May, the final nine West Coast dates were announced with Winds of Plague and Scars of Tomorrow. The band&#x27;s final performance came on August 3, 2014, at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California.

=== Reunion and &quot;Love Will Kill All&quot; (2018–2022) ===

In December 2015, Bleeding Through reunion rumors began to circulate after a new post surfaced from the band&#x27;s official Facebook account, which read &quot;Nothing Is Over. 2016&quot;. Days later, the band clarified that their return was for one show, and had no further plans. This was a performance in February 2016 on the second night of Friends Fest, a two-day event at Chain Reaction to benefit the medical bills of the Ghost Inside following their tour bus accident.
On January 1, SharpTone Records issued a teaser for music they were releasing in 2018 and some listeners apparently recognized vocalist Brandan Schiepatti&#x27;s voice on their page. On March 28, 2018, the band announced they were returning with a new album, &quot;Love Will Kill All&quot;, and it would be released on May 25 through SharpTone. According to Schieppati, who suffered from mental health problems and went through a divorce while the band was inactive, much of the album&#x27;s content revolved around the band&#x27;s frustrations with the music industry which led to their breakup, as well as with friends he lost during that period, alongside the resulting feelings of isolation. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by the songs &quot;Set Me Free&quot; on April 6, followed by &quot;Fade into the Ash&quot; on May 11. 

The band&#x27;s first reunion show was a sold-out gig which took place on June 8 at the Observatory in Santa Ana, California. Footage from the video was featured in the music video for the song &quot;No Friends&quot;, released on July 4. Among other shows, the band played at festivals to promote the album, including East Coast Tsunami in Reading, Pennsylvania and Texas Revolution in Austin, Texas. In 2019, the band made a stop on the San Diego stop of Hatebreed&#x27;s 25th anniversary tour, and the Musink Festival in Costa Mesa, California, followed by performances at European festivals that year, including Jera on Air in the Netherlands that June, and With Full Force in Germany. The band performed at the Hell and Heaven Fest in Mexico City in March 2020 at the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== &quot;Rage&quot; EP and 20th anniversary of &quot;This Is Love...&quot; (2022–2023) ===

In November 2020, Schieppati announced the band was working on new material with Kenney. Work progressed slowly over the course of the next 14 months, but the band posted tentative song titles from the studio on their Instagram account in February 2022. On May 20, 2022, a single titled &quot;Rage&quot; was released. This was followed by the surprise release of an extended play of the same name on July 1, 2022. Shortly after the release of the EP, Leppke was replaced by John Arnold. The band promoted the EP with a performance at the revival of Tattoo the Earth as a festival at the Worcester Palladium. In November, the band announced two East Coast dates with the newly-reunited God Forbid in January, followed in December by the announcement of new material in the works. The next week, a West Coast tour from February to April was announced, with Ov Sulfur opening the first three dates. 

On April 21, 2023, Bleeding Through released a new song titled &quot;War Time&quot;. The band also spent 2023 celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;This Is Love, This Is Murderous&quot;; in July, the band went on a three-date tour of Texas to celebrate the anniversary alongside Unearth, who were celebrating 25 years together as a band. After the band played the first night of Indecision 30, a three-day festival celebrating Indecision Records&#x27; 30th anniversary later that month, the band released a re-recorded version of &quot;Love Lost in a Hail of Gun Fire&quot; on August 16, 2023. During the same recording sessions, the band also re-recorded the songs &quot;On Wings of Lead&quot; and &quot;Number Seven with a Bullet&quot;. The next three days were spent performing anniversary shows for the album in the American Midwest, followed by back-to-back shows in New York over the first weekend of September. The re-recorded version of &quot;On Wings of Lead&quot; was released later that year on November 24. One final anniversary performance took place on December 16, 2023, at Anaheim&#x27;s House of Blues.

===&quot;Nine&quot; (2024–present)===

In early 2024, the band began to tease new material. By this point, Brandon Richter had become a guitarist for the band. While working on new material, the band appeared at the United Kingdom&#x27;s Damnation Festival in February, followed by the remaining two &quot;This Is Love...&quot; anniversary shows in the Pacific Northwest in March. On May 8, the band released the first song from their ninth studio album, titled &quot;Our Brand Is Chaos&quot;; they appeared at Big Texas Metal Fest in a few weeks later. They once again joined Unearth in June for a Boston date celebrating the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;.

The band played a tour of Australia in September 2024, after which Bleeding Through released their album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Dead But So Alive&quot; on September 17. They returned to the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival a few days later. These shows were the last to feature Wombacher, as he stepped down from performing shows with the band due to back injuries. On November 29, the group announced the upcoming release of the album, titled &quot;Nine&quot;, alongside the release of a third song, &quot;Path of Our Disease&quot;. At that time, the tracklist and cover art were also revealed; the album contains three guest appearances, something the band had not included on an album since &quot;Declaration&quot;. One of these guests was Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid, who was featured on &quot;I Am Resistance&quot;, the album&#x27;s fourth single which was released on January 9, 2025. On February 6, Wombacher announced his permanent departure from the band, citing multiple back injuries which led him to drop from the touring lineup the previous September. He remained on good terms with the rest of the band, and expressed pride in the upcoming album. The album was released on February 14.

== Musical style and influences ==

Bleeding Through&#x27;s music has been described as metalcore, expanding their hardcore punk roots into death metal and black metal territory. Like many metalcore bands, Bleeding Through is influenced by Swedish melodic death metal. It is the most apparent on &quot;Dust to Ashes&quot;, while with time the band&#x27;s music got gradually more and more melodic, with &quot;The Truth&quot; being the most melodic to date, even containing a power ballad, a novelty for the band. A keyboard player was introduced to the band shortly before the band began performing as an unsigned act. According Danough, &quot;it adds a different element&quot; to their music compared to others in the metalcore scene.

Originally, the band&#x27;s main influence was the hardcore band Integrity, but the band rapidly diversified into more metallic styles. Danough said that he was influenced by metal and hardcore bands such as At the Gates, Slayer, Cradle of Filth, and Earth Crisis, in addition to Integrity. Vocalist Brandan Schieppati has mentioned American thrash metal bands as an influence on Bleeding Through, such as Testament or Exodus. In an interview, guitarist Brian Leppke added Cro-Mags, Entombed, Crowbar and Pantera to the list of influences. The keyboards presented by Marta Demmel incorporate industrial and gothic inspirations to the band&#x27;s sound, and this unconventional approach led to association with black metal influences.

Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: &quot;I think we&#x27;re a hardcore band and I&#x27;ll never say we are a metal band, we&#x27;re all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we&#x27;re trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.&quot;

<doc id="536619" wikidata="Q1755892" url="?curid=536619" title="18 til I Die">
<text>18 til I Die is the seventh studio album by the Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams. Released on June 5, 1996, by A&amp;M Records, the album became a commercial success peaking at No. 1 in the United Kingdom and No. 2 in his home country Canada. It was recorded on different locations which included Jamaica and France. &quot;18 til I Die&quot; featured the number one song &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot;, which had been released as a single and on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; over a year prior, and 4 other singles: &quot;The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You&quot; (the album&#x27;s second single, released May 8), &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Night to Remember&quot;, &quot;Star&quot;, and &quot;18 til I Die&quot;; the album track &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Be Right There&quot; was also released to radio in the United States. Adams traveled throughout North America and Europe to promote the album after its June release, notably playing in front of over 70,000 people at Wembley Stadium in July 1996. The album performed lower than expectations in the US but it sold 5 million copies worldwide.

==Music==

===Recording and production===
The album was written and recorded and produced by Adams and R.J. &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange in a house in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, from Winter 1994 to Summer 1995 and in two different houses in Provence, France, from Autumn 1995 to Spring 1996 using the The Warehouse Studio Mobile Unit remote recording truck. Even the mix was done in a house in Provence, France, in March 1996 by Bob Clearmountain. Adams played some of these songs live before release; for example, he played &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Night to Remember&quot; at a soundcheck in a gig in 1993 during the So Far So Good World Tour. Adams had completed 12 songs by 1995, but felt that something was lacking in the album, and went back and recorded two new songs: &quot;The Only Thing&quot; and &quot;18 til I Die&quot;. Adams then named the album &quot;18 til I Die&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;18 til I Die&quot; was officially released in June 1996. In the United States the album peaked at 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and held that position for three weeks. In Adams&#x27; native Canada, &quot;18 til I Die&quot; reached number 4. The album was released in Australia, Europe and New Zealand in late June 1996. The album was a massive commercial success during its release in Europe, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart, Adams&#x27; second in a row. &quot;18 til I Die&quot; reached the top ten in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Austria, Sweden, Germany and Australia, and was a moderate top 20 success in France.

The album was certified platinum in the United States, &quot;18 til I Die&quot; was certified three-times platinum in Canada and Australia and two-times platinum in the UK.

&quot;18 til I Die&quot; included the hit singles &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman&quot;, &quot;The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Night to Remember&quot;, &quot;Star&quot;, and &quot;18 til I Die&quot;, all of which had accompanying music videos. &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot; had been the number-one song on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five weeks when originally released in spring 1995, while &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Night to Remember&quot;, the second single from the album to chart in the United States, peaked at 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (and number 6 on the adult contemporary chart). The other singles became big hits in Europe. &quot;The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You&quot; was the most successful rock song from &quot;18 til I Die&quot;, reaching number 5 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 on the Canadian Singles Chart. The music video for &quot;The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You&quot; received heavy airplay on music television. In early 1997, the track &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Be Right There&quot; became the album&#x27;s final single, reaching number 3 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart and number 59 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart.

===Album differences===
On November 4, 1996, a second Australian version of &quot;18 til I Die&quot; was released, featuring the song &quot;I Finally Found Someone&quot; (a duet with Barbra Streisand) in place of &quot;You&#x27;re Still Beautiful to Me&quot; and had an alternative cover with a purple background and a different track order, while the Japanese version contained the bonus song &quot;Hey Elvis&quot;.

<doc id="536622" wikidata="Q1535438" url="?curid=536622" title="Pacific Fur Company">
<text>The Pacific Fur Company (PFC) was an American fur trade venture wholly owned and funded by John Jacob Astor that functioned from 1810 to 1813. It was based in the Pacific Northwest, an area contested over the decades among the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Spanish Empire, the United States of America and the Russian Empire.

Management, clerks and fur trappers were sent both by land and by sea to the Pacific Coast in the Autumn of 1810. The base of operations was constructed at the mouth of the Columbia River in 1811, Fort Astoria (present-day Astoria, Oregon). The destruction of the company vessel the &quot;Tonquin&quot; later that year off the shore of Vancouver Island took with it the majority of the annual trading goods. Commercial competition with the British-Canadian North West Company began soon after the foundation of Fort Astoria. The Canadian competitors maintained several stations in the interior, primarily Spokane House, Kootanae House and Saleesh House. Fort Okanogan was also opened in 1811, the first of several PFC posts created to counter these locations. The Overland Expedition faced military hostilities from several Indigenous cultures and later had an acute provision crisis leading to starvation. Despite losing men crossing the Great Plains and later at the Snake River, they arrived in groups throughout January and February 1812 at Fort Astoria.

A beneficial agreement with the Russian-American Company was also planned through the regular supply of provisions for posts in Russian America. This was planned in part to prevent the rival Montreal based North West Company (NWC) to gain a presence along the Pacific Coast, a prospect neither Russian colonial authorities nor Astor favored.

The lack of military protection during the War of 1812 forced the sale of PFC assets to the NWC. While the transactions were not finalized until 1814, due to the distance from Fort Astoria to Montreal and New York City, the company was functionally defunct by 1813. A party of Astorians returning overland to St. Louis in 1813 made the important discovery of the South Pass through the Rocky Mountains. This geographic feature would later be used by hundreds of thousands of settlers traveling over the Oregon, California, and Mormon routes, collectively called the Westward Expansion Trails. The emporium envisioned by Astor was a failure for a number of reasons, including the loss of two supply ships, the material difficulties of crossing the North American continent and competition from the North West Company. Historian Arthur S. Morton concluded that &quot;The misfortunes which befell the Pacific Fur Company were great, but such as might be expected at the initiation of an enterprise in a distant land whose difficulties and whose problems lay beyond the experience of the traders.&quot;

==Formation==


John Jacob Astor was a merchant of New York City and founder of the American Fur Company. To create a chain of trading stations spread across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Northwest, he incorporated an AFC subsidiary, the Pacific Fur Company. The commercial venture was originally designed to last for twenty years. Unlike its major competitor the Canadian owned NWC, the Pacific Fur Company was not a Joint-stock company. Capital for the PFC amounted to $200,000 divided into 100 shares individually valued at $2,000 and was funded entirely by Astor. The American Fur Company held half of the stock and the other half divided among prospective management and clerks. The chief representative of Astor in the daily operations was Wilson Price Hunt, a St. Louis businessman with no outback experience who received five shares. Each working partner was assigned four shares with the remaining shares held in reserve for hired clerks. Fellow partners in the venture were recruited from the NWC, the members being Alexander McKay, David Stuart, Duncan McDougall, and Donald Mackenzie. Astor and the partners met in New York on 23 June 1810 to sign the Pacific Fur Company&#x27;s provisional agreement.

To establish the fledgling PFC trade posts in the distant Oregon Country, Astor&#x27;s plan called for an extensive movement of large groups of employees overland following the route of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and navally by sailing around Cape Horn. The venture was planned on methods used in the AFC for the collection of fur pelts. Complements of employees (later called &quot;Astorians&quot;) would operate in various parts of the region to complete trapping excursions. Outposts maintained by the PFC would be freighted necessary foodstuffs and supplies by annual cargo ships from New York City. Trade goods such as beads, blankets, and copper would be exchanged with the local Native Americans for fur pelts.

Ongoing supply issues faced by the Russian-American Company were seen as a means to gain more furs. Cargo ships en route from the Columbia were planned to then sail north for Russian America to bring much needed provisions. By cooperating with Russian colonial authorities to strengthen their material presence in Russian America, it was hoped by Astor to stop the NWC or any other British presence to be established upon the Pacific Coast. A tentative agreement for merchant vessels owned by Astor to ship furs gathered in Russian America into the Qing Empire was signed in 1812. Company ships then were directed to sail to the port of Guangzhou, where furs were then sold for impressive profits. Chinese products like porcelain, nankeens and tea were to be purchased; with the ships then to cross the Indian Ocean and head for European and American markets to sell the Chinese wares.

==Labor recruitment==
The PFC required a sizable number of laborers, fur trappers and in particular Voyageurs to staff company locations. Recruiting for the company&#x27;s two expeditions were led by Wilson Hunt and Donald Mackenzie for the overland party and Alexander McKay for the naval bound group. All three men were based out of Montreal throughout May to July 1810. Hunt was designated to lead the Overland Expedition, despite his inexperience in dealing with Indigenous cultures, or residing in the wilderness. It was suggested that Hunt instead trade positions with McKay and travel on the &quot;Tonquin&quot;. However, it was determined to keep Hunt in charge of the land party.

The customary time for free agents to be sent into the interior from Montreal was in May, leaving few men left in the city available for hire. The recruitment effort stalled in part from the bitter treatment by the NWC and Hunt&#x27;s lack of prior experience as a fur merchant, the source of many issues later on. PFC contracts were atypically favorable for hired men when compared to its Montreal competitors. Terms included a forty percent larger annual salary, double the cash advanced prior to departure and a length of service lasting five years, rather than the more common two or three year employment.

===McKay&#x27;s efforts===
During the summer of 1810, Alexander McKay hired thirteen French-Canadians for the &quot;Tonquin&quot;. The majority of the group remained in Montreal until late July, when they given directives to withdraw to New York City. A canoe provided transportation for the trip up the Richelieu River and Lake Champlain. At Whitehall additional men that were employed by McKay joined the southbound party, among them Ovide de Montigny. On 3 August they reached New York City, with the group&#x27;s &quot;hats decorated with parti-colored ribands and feathers...&quot; causing some Americans to believe them to Natives. The following day lodgings at Long Island were reached and the scene was described by clerk Gabriel Franchère:&quot;We sang as we rowed; which, joined to the unusual sight of a birch bark canoe impelled by nine stout Canadians, dark as Indians, and as gayly adorned, attracted a crowd upon the wharves to gaze at us as we glided along.&quot; While waiting to depart for the Pacific, McKay met with British diplomatic official Francis James Jackson. The official assured McKay that in the event of war between the United States and United Kingdom, all PFC employees that were British employees would be treated as such.

===Hunt&#x27;s efforts===
Thirteen men signed contracts in Montreal to join Hunt on the journey to the Pacific coast by land. Notably only one had previously operated under a contract lasting longer than a year. The generous cash advancements were taken advantage by three men who deserted before Hunt and the remaining group left the city for Michilimackinac in July. The party reached Mackinac Island on 28 July 1810. Acting as a major depot for the regional Great Lakes fur trade, the island was where Hunt focused on hiring more men for the company. The veteran fur merchant Ramsay Crooks was convinced to join the company and assisted in recruiting additional men. Over the sixteen days spent there, a total seventeen men were recruited to the concern with sixteen being French-Canadian. This group of men, unlike those hired in Montreal, had extensive experience working in the fur trade as voyageurs and other roles. Likely suggested by Crooks, interested men already hired by other companies would have their contracts purchased from their employers.

After the men were finally gathered in early August, Hunt and the party departed for St. Louis and arrived there on 3 September. The hired voyageurs and fur trappers completed many transactions with various merchants in St. Louis and in the nearby French-Canadian settlement of Ste. Genevieve throughout September and October. These were recorded on the company ledger and particular purchases been argued as the men collecting goods to trade with various Indigenous nations they would visit. In particular, these negotiations by the French-Canadians have been thought to be steps towards later establishing themselves as independent traders in relatively unexploited fur regions. Most of the men in the Overland Party were engaged as hunters, interpreters, guides and voyageurs.

==Oceanic component==
The advanced party was sent to create the initial base of operations at the mouth of the Columbia River. Necessary trade goods for deals with Indigenous and needed supplies to establish the station were shipped on the same vessel In addition to beginning the company headquarters, this party would block any attempts by the NWC to create a station in the area. The ship &quot;Tonquin&quot; was purchased by Astor in 1810 to start commercial operations on the Pacific Ocean. The majority of the company partners. Duncan McDougall, David and Robert Stuart, and Alexander McKay would head this detachment. In addition, clerks Gabriel Franchère and Alexander Ross would join them on the planned voyage.

===The &quot;Tonquin&quot;===

Under the command of Jonathan Thorn the &quot;Tonquin&quot; left New York on September 8, 1810. PFC employees numbered thirty-three men in total on board. The vessel landed at the Falkland Islands on 4 December to make repairs and take on water supplies at Port Egmont. Captain Thorn attempted to abandon eight of the crew still on shore, among them clerks Gabriel Franchère and Alexander Ross. The stranded men were taken on board after Robert Stuart threatened to kill Thorn. Communication between company workers was no longer held in English to keep the captain excluded from discussions. Company partners held talks in their ancestral Scottish Gaelic and the laborers used Canadian French. On December 25 the &quot;Tonquin&quot; rounded Cape Horn and sailed north into the Pacific Ocean.

The ship anchored at the Kingdom of Hawaii in February 1811. Due to the possibility of men abandoning their posts to live in the tropical islands, Thorn assembled all of the crew and PFC employees to harass them to remain on the ship. Commercial transactions with Hawaiians saw the crew purchasing cabbage, sugar cane, purple yams, taro, coconuts, watermelon, breadfruit, hogs, goats, two sheep, and poultry in return for &quot;glass beads, iron rings, needles, cotton cloth&quot;. Upon entering Honolulu, the crew was greeted by Isaac Davis and Francisco de Paula Marín, the latter acting an interpreter in negotiations with Kamehameha I and prominent government official Kalanimoku. 24 Native Hawaiian Kanakas were hired with the approval of Kamehameha I, who appointed Naukane to oversee their interests.

The Columbia River was reached in March 1811. Despite stormy conditions, over several days Thorn ordered two boats dispatched to scout a safe route over the treacherous Columbia Bar. Both boats would capsize and eight men lost their lives. Finally on March 24, the &quot;Tonquin&quot; crossed the bar, passing into the Columbia’s estuary and laid anchor in Baker’s Bay. Captain Thorn stressed the urgency for the &quot;Tonquin&quot; to start trading further north along the Pacific Coast as instructed by Astor. After 65 days on the Columbia River, the &quot;Tonquin&quot; departed with a crew of 23 with McKay was aboard the ship as supercargo. At Vancouver Island she was boarded by the Tla-o-qui-aht people of Clayoquot Sound, where Thorn caused an uproar by hitting a Tla-o-qui-aht noble with a pelt. In the ensuing conflict all of men brought on the &quot;Tonquin&quot; were killed besides an interpreter from the Quinault nation and the ship was destroyed. This put the occupants of Fort Astoria in a tough position, having no access to seaborne transport until the following year.

===Fort Astoria===

Construction on Fort Astoria, an &quot;emporium of the west&quot;, began in the middle of April 1811. It was built upon Point George, the location being about from the Lewis and Clark Expedition winter camp of Fort Clatsop. The terrain and thick forests made clearing a foundation exceedingly difficult. Late in the month, McDougall reported that there was &quot;little progress in clearing, the place being so full of half decayed trunks, large fallen timber &amp; thick brush.&quot; No one among the party had previous experience in the logging industry and many hadn&#x27;t used an axe before in general. Trees had a layer of hardened resin and were of a massive size. Four men worked as a team on platforms at least eight feet above the ground to effectively cut a tree, with it taking typically two days for a single tree to be felled. Medical issues quickly became another major issue for the party as there was not a single medical officer among the passengers brought on the &quot;Tonquin&quot;. This left treatments rudimentary at best. During the initial months on the Columbia River at any time upwards of half of the expedition was unable to perform manual labor due to illness.

===Fort Okanogan===

Kaúxuma Núpika, a Two-Spirit from the Ktunaxa people, and his wife arrived at Fort Astoria on 15 June 1811 with a letter from John Stuart. Kaúxuma offered accounts of the interior and recommended that the station be opened at the confluence of the Columbia and &quot;the Okannaakken River&quot; among the Syilx peoples. It was determined that David Stuart would take a party to with Kaúxuma to the Syilx. Before they left however the inhabitants of Astoria were surprised by the arrival of David Thompson on 15 July. Thompson later stated that his group &quot;set off on a voyage down the Columbia River to explore this river in order to open out a passage for the interior trade with the Pacific Ocean.&quot; The competing fur traders were cordially received at Astoria.

A party of eight led by David Stuart departed on 22 July for the Syilx territories. The personnel assigned to join Stuart were eight men, including Alexander Ross, François Benjamin Pillet, Ovide de Montigny, and Naukane. The group joined David Thompson and his eight men in traveling up the Columbia, staying together until the Dalles. Upon entering Watlala Chinookan territory, Stuart failed establish favorable relations with them. Watlala men performed several military displays and stole a small amount of goods. Naukane agreed to join the NWC shortly after this episode and the two parties separated. Stuart was able to secure the protection of Wasco-Wishram leadership in early August. Groups of Chinookan laborers were used to cross the portages of the Columbia in their homeland.

Stuart&#x27;s party soon began to travel through the Sahaptin nations and on the 12th of August an assembly of Walla Walla, Cayuse and Nez Perce welcomed the fur traders. Once the reception was complete, the PFC men continued up the Columbia and passed by the future site of Fort Nez Percés. Towards the end of August the party began to become troubled with Western Rattlesnake populations and rapids, almost losing one canoe and the men aboard it to a section of swift currents. Stuart and his men were greeted by Wenatchi leadership at the Wenatchee River, who gave two horses to the fur traders as a gift in addition to several more being purchased. While passing through other Indigenous homelands the PFC continued financial dealings for food supplies. Members of the Chelan nation traded &quot;some salmon, roots, and berries&quot; and later Methows offered their &quot;abundance of salmon&quot; and &quot;many horses&quot; to the fur trappers for sale.

While at the junction of the Columbia and Okanogan River, a large encampment of Syilx were encountered. Prominent members of the nation entreated the fur traders to reside among their people, proclaiming &quot;themselves to be always be our friends, to kill us plenty of beavers, to furnish us at all times with provisions, and to ensure our protection and safety.&quot; The cargo of the canoes were taken to land on 1 September and work soon began on Fort Okanogan. A residence crafted from driftwood acquired from the Okanogan River. While construction of the post was ongoing, four men that included Pillet were detailed to inform the progress of inland trade. The party arrived back at the company headquarters on 11 October and gave its favorable report.

Stuart led Montigny and two other men to follow the course of the Okanogan, leaving only Ross at the post. As promised, the Syilx provided security for the station, frequently alerting Ross when intruders from other nations came near. Despite planning on exploring the Okanogan watershed for a month, Stuart and his three men did not return until 22 March 1812. Upon reaching the Okanogan headwaters the party then went over to the Thompson River. Snows in mountain passes made it exceedingly difficult for the party to travel. Detained among the Secwepemc, Stuart developed cordial relations with them. Finding their areas rich in beaver populations, he promised to return later that year to create a trading post.

==The Lower Chinookan peoples==

Diplomatic relationships with the Chinookan villages near the Columbia were critical for the viability of Fort Astoria. Scholars have affirmed that the American company and its &quot;economic success depended on mutually beneficial economic exchanges with Indian groups... who controlled trade.&quot; Many of the settlements near the station were under the influence of headman Comcomly.

===Assistance in exploration===
Chinookans were highly important in company explorations of the Pacific Coast. In particular, they were instrumental in finding a suitable location for what became Fort Astoria. In early April 1811 McDougall and David Stuart visited Comcomly, who advised them not to return to the Columbia River as it was then quite tumultuous. The two men didn&#x27;t listen and shortly afterward their canoe capsized in the river. The &quot;timely succor&quot; of Comcomly and his villagers ensured the partners were saved before they drowned. After recuperating there for three days, they returned to the PFC camp.

Additional services tendered was the relaying information from more distant peoples to the Astorians. Reports were circulated by them in late April 1811 of a trade post maintained by white men in the interior. This was correctly conjectured by PFC employees to be their NWC rivals, later found to be Spokane House. Departing on 2 May, McKay led Robert Stuart, Franchère, Ovide de Montigny and a number of voyaguers up the Columbia, with Clatsop noble Coalpo acting as guide and interpreter. The following day they explored the Cowlitz River and soon encountered a large canoe flotilla of Cowlitz warriors. McKay was able to request a parlay, during which the Cowlitz stated they were armed for combat against the nearby Skilloot Chinookan village near the river mouth. Reaching the Dalles on 10 May, no trade station was found at the important fishery. Due to Coalpo&#x27;s fear of reprisal from his enemies among the Wasco and Wishram, the party went back to Fort Astoria, returning on 14 May.

Despite not finding the NWC post, management at Fort Astoria soon became &quot;anxious to acquire a knowledge of the country &amp; the prospects of trade... within our reach&quot;. On 6 June 1811, Robert Stuart went north on a tour of western Olympic Peninsula with Calpo acting as a guide again. Returning on 24 June, Stuart reported that the Quinault and nearby Quileute nations would kill Sea otters and trade their pelts for the valuable Dentalium shells sold by the Nuu-chah-nulth on Vancouver Island. Stuart felt that a company trade post in Grays Harbor offered the best location to secure these furs. Additionally he gave the opinion that Alutiiq in Russian America should be recruited to hunt various fur bearing animals at the hypothetical factory.

However, Chinookans were not always willing to help Astorians in visiting distant locations. This was a means of delaying the Astorians from making commercial connections with Indigenous peoples on the Upper Columbia. One particular incident has been described by historian Robert F. Jones as &quot;an effort to keep Comcomly&#x27;s Chinooks as middlemen between the natives of the upper Columbia and the Astorians.&quot; François Benjamin Pillet was ordered to make a trading trip along the Columbia. Accompanied by a Chinook headman, they left Fort Astoria in late June 1811. Small trade deals were completed with Skilloots near modern Oak Point. Afterwards, the headman cited the seasonal flooding as making the Columbia unsafe to travel further upriver. This forced Pillet to return to Astoria with what pelts he had purchased from the Skilloots.

===Commercial ties===
Consistently small stockpiles of foodstuffs at Fort Astoria created the need for frequent transactions with Chinookans for sustenance. Seasonal fish runs provided the major nutritional sources for the Columbian River-based Natives. After ceremonial rituals during each major fish run, trade for caught fish would begin in earnest with the Astorians. A constant task for Hawaiians would be to perform fisherman duties. Major fish populations active in the Columbia included the Candlefish smelt, White sturgeon, Sockeye salmon and Chinook salmon. This dependence on fish made it a primary food source for the Astorians, which caused some discontent among employees desiring a more familiar diet.

Terrestrial animals like members of the family Cervidae such as Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer were not found in large numbers around Fort Astoria. This made them another important source of trade for the Chinookans when visiting the PFC station. Another frequent item sold when fish supplies were low in the winter was the Wapato root. Wapato provided a common source of calories for Chinookans and other nations. The Astorians described the tuber as &quot;a good substitute for potatoes&quot; Purchases of Wapato occurred in such volumes that a small cellar had to be created specifically to house the produce. Other typical purchases from Chinookans included manufactured goods. In particular woven hats were frequently bought for protection against the seasonal rains. These hats were tightly interwoven, making them essentially waterproof. Of benefit to the Astorians was that they were typically wide enough to cover the shoulders. Ross described the common artwork depicted them as &quot;chequered&quot; with various animal designs that were &quot;not painted, but ingeniously interwoven.&quot;

Chinookans near Fort Astoria employed various means of retaining their valuable middle man position between various neighboring Indigenous peoples and the PFC. Additional tactics involved manipulating the perception neighboring Natives had of the American company. In August 1811, a small party of Chehalis visited Fort Astoria. In dialogue with them McDougall inquired why they would rarely directly trade with the PFC. The Chehalis merchants responded that Chinooks affiliated with Comcomly claimed that the Astorians were &quot;very inveterate against their nation.&quot; McDougall concluded this story was used by Comcomly to continue his commercial hegemony over the area.

===Fear of hostilities===
It wasn&#x27;t always that the Astorians, especially McDougall trusted Comcomly or Chinookans in general. His judgment of them, despite eventually marrying a daughter of Comcomly was that they were often ready to attack the fort. In particular Jones noted that he &quot;seems to place implicit faith in any possible hostile actions by the natives.&quot;

In June 1812, the number of men at Fort Astoria were reduced to 11 Hawaiians and 39 European descendants. Fear of attack by Chinookans was high and drills were directed by McDougall frequently. A delegation of Chinookans visited Fort Astoria on 2 July quickly left after witnessing these military demonstrations. This fear by the natives convinced the Astorians that &quot;they are not friendly disposed towards us...&quot; having &quot;a desire to harm us.&quot; According to Jones, this &quot;latent distrust&quot; of Chinookans by Astorians from this incident was probably unfounded, as they entered the post &quot;for an innocent purpose&quot; and were frightened by the drills.

Fears of attack didn&#x27;t disappear and Astorians kept themselves guarded in dealing with natives. After the &quot;Beaver&quot; left for Russian America rumors spread of a coming attack on Astoria in August 1812. There were large numbers of Chinookans and Chehalis near Comcomly&#x27;s village at the time. This expedited construction on two bastions and the fort was &quot;put in readiness for an attack.&quot; Jones has pointed out that these movements of Indigenous was very likely a part of seasonal fishing, rather than a supposed hostile gathering.

==Overland Expedition==
As the leader of the expedition Hunt would make a number of decisions which were disastrous. The movement of Hunt&#x27;s group has been described as &quot;a company of traders forging westward in [a] haphazard fashion.&quot; He ordered the expedition to leave St. Louis just before the winter to reduce company expenses of supporting employees. The group departed on October 21, 1810 for Fort Osage. The expedition traveled up the Missouri River before setting up winter camp on Nodaway Island, at the mouth of Nodaway River in Andrew County, Missouri, just north of St. Joseph. French-Canadian employees made frequent purchases from the company store during the idle season, especially those hired at Michilimackinac. Small items like blue beads, vermilion, brass rings, tobacco &quot;carrots&quot;, small axes among others were used in transactions with Missouria neighboring the camp.

In January 1811, Hunt sailed down the Missouri River to complete several pending transactions at St. Louis. It was during this time he recruited Pierre Dorion Jr., as he was the only qualified speaker of the Sioux languages in St. Louis at the time. Notably he was in debt to Manuel Lisa and the Missouri Fur Company (MFC), something that would lead to tensions between the fur companies later in the year. In the end Hunt was able to secure Dorion, on the condition that Marie and his two children be brought along as well. Once finalized, he took British naturalists John Bradbury and Thomas Nuttall with him to the Nodaway camp, as previously agreed upon. The party left St. Louis on 12 March and reached Fort Osage on the 8th of April. Early into the travel Dorion physically abused his wife and caused her to flee for a day. At the station Ramsay Crooks was waiting for them and the group recuperated for two days. The group left Fort Osage on the 10th of April and during the day Dorion &quot;severely beat his squaw&quot; as Marie desired to stay with newly made Osage acquaintances rather than continue with the expedition. The group reached the winter camp on the 17th. The overland group at this point amounted to almost sixty men, forty being French-Canadian voyageurs.

===Following the Missouri===
Hunt&#x27;s expedition broke the Nodaway winter camp on April 21. The Astorians reached a major Omaha village in early May. Active commercial transactions were completed there, with Omaha merchants offering &quot;jerked buffalo meat, tallow, corn, and marrow&quot; for vermilion, beads and tobacco carrots. Bradbury detailed that the Omaha village had plots of nicotiana rustica, melons, beans, squashes, and corn under cultivation. While at the Omaha settlement, Hunt received information from several visiting Yankton Sioux that a group of Sioux was gathering further up the river to stop the expedition from traveling further.

Proceeding further the Missouri River, the Sioux party was encountered on 31 May. The Sioux bands were a conglomeration of Yankton and Lakota and had around six hundred armed men. Tensions quickly arose between the two disparate groups and both took up positions by the Missouri River. The two company howitzers and single Swivel gun were loaded with powder and fired to intimidate the Sioux bands. The artillery were then loaded with live ammunition, but the Sioux across the river began to &quot;spread their buffalo robes before them, and moved them side to side.&quot; Dorion stopped the firing of the armaments a second time, as he understood this action by the Sioux meant they desired a parley. Peace talks were held and the Sioux explained that they had formed to prevent the PFC from trading with the neighboring nations they were at war with, the Arikara, Mandan and the Gros Ventre. Hunt explained that the expedition intended to travel to the Pacific Ocean and they had no interest in the neighboring Indigenous groups. This was found to be acceptable by the Sioux leaders, and the PFC was allowed to depart further north.

On 3 June, employees of the Missouri Fur Company under the command of Manuel Lisa were encountered on the Missouri River. Lisa reminded Dorion of his pending debt to the company, and a duel between the two men was narrowly averted by Bradbury and Henry Marie Brackenridge intervening. After this incident the rival fur companies refrained from interacting and camped on opposite sides of the Missouri River. Despite this, Lisa and Hunt led their parties north towards an Arikara village and reached it on 12 June. In a council with local leadership Lisa declared that if any of Hunt&#x27;s party were harmed he&#x27;d take it as an offense against him as well. In setting the standard rate for purchasing horses, &quot;carbines, powder, ball, tomahawks knives&quot; were in high demand as the Arikara were planning an attack upon the Sioux. Lisa and Hunt made a deal allowing for Hunt&#x27;s boats to be exchanged for additional horses, kept at Fort Lisa further up the Missouri River. Crooks was sent with a small group to fetch the horses and while they reached Fort Lisa on the 23rd, they had to wait until the 25th for Lisa to arrive to finalize the transaction. The party left the following day and returned south to Hunt&#x27;s camp.

===The Rocky Mountains===
While at the Arikara village, Hunt met and employed several American trappers that had previously worked for the MFC in modern Idaho. The men advised strongly against going into the Piikáni homelands of modern Montana. The Piikáni and other Niitsitapi nations at the time were typically unreceptive to trespass from European descendants and made a showing of military force against the Lewis and Clark Expedition. This changed Hunt&#x27;s plans, who according determined it best to avoid the Niitsitapi peoples.

The expedition left their Arikara hosts in late July for the nearby Grand River. After following the Little Missouri River, the party to rest for several days while transactions were made with a band of Cheyenne. In total 36 horses were purchased from the Cheyenne. The expedition broke camp on 6 August and Hunt ordered six men to hunt Bison. Hunt&#x27;s party continued southwest through the modern state of Wyoming and the hunting party rejoined on the 18th of August, having killed 8 Bison. While at the base of Cloud Peak on 30 August, a scouting party of Apsáalooke visited the camp. The following day a delegation of Apsáalooke on horseback invited them to visit their nearby village. Hunt recalled the importance of mercantile deals with the Apsáalooke stating that:&quot;We spent the first day of September buying some robes and belts and trading our tired, maimed horses for fresh ones... thereby augmenting the number of our horses to about 121, most of which were well-trained and able to cross the mountains.&quot; Continuing westward towards the Continental Divide of the Americas, the PFC party followed the course of the Wind River, crossed the Divide and followed the Gros Ventre River.

===Snake River===
The expedition reached Fort Henry on 8 September, made by MFC employee Andrew Henry the previous year, near present-day St. Anthony and made a camp there. The post was later abandoned. While at the location work began creating enough canoes necessary to take the party down Henry&#x27;s Fork and later the Snake River or so called &quot;Mad River&quot; to the Columbia. This was done as it felt no longer necessary to travel with pack horses, a decision that would soon cause more issues for the party. On the 10th, four men and two Natives under the command of Joseph Miller departed to begin trapping in the area. The horses that remained in the possession of the PFC, amounting to seventy-seven, were left in the care of &quot;two young Snakes&quot;. The party departed from Fort Henry on 19 September on the newly made canoes.

Traveling down the Snake River proved highly difficult due to the many rapids such as Caldron Linn. The party was forced to perform multiple portages due to these fierce currents. Over course of the remainder of September through early November, four incidents of canoes capsizing killed one man meant major losses in trade goods and food supplies. In addition to the hardships caused from attempting to follow the course of the Snake more problems arose due to dwindling food stockpiles. By 31 October there was enough provisions to last for five days. In early November there were not many animals in the area to gather for food, the few that were caught by the hunting parties were beaver. The traveling partners agreed to end travel by canoe, finding the mode of transportation too difficult continue using. Hunt ordered several groups go in various directions to contact neighboring Indigenous for material support. In the meantime the PFC expedition began to deposit its trade goods in small caches to lighten the workload of the men.

At the suggestion of Ramsay Crooks, the expedition was divided into two parties of nineteen men each, with each member receiving 5formula_1 pounds of dried meat. A third small group was led by Donald MacKenzie to reach Fort Astoria ahead of the main contingent. All that remained in the company stores was &quot;forty pounds of corn, twenty of fat, and nearly five pounds of bouillon tablets.&quot; On 9 November the two groups began traveling on either side of the Snake. Soon the cliffs became too steep to allow an easy descent to the river banks for water. Sources of hydration became very limited and despite intercourse with several groups of Indigenous the situation didn&#x27;t improve. Water was collected on 20 November after it rained the previous night. Up to that point &quot;several Canadians had begun to drink their urine&quot; in desperation.

Crooks reunited with Hunt&#x27;s party in early December alone. Crooks was so weakened from starvation that his pace would have slowed the expedition immensely. Hunt left two men to tend to Crooks while the main group pushed forward. Several villages of Northern Shoshone were visited and vitally needed food sources such as horses along with &quot;some dried fish, a few roots, and some pounded dried cherries&quot; were purchased. A Shoshone was convinced to act as a scout to guide the PFC group to the Umatilla River. On 23 December, thirteen men assigned to Crooks party were met who gave the unfortunate news that they hadn&#x27;t seen him since he left Hunt&#x27;s group.

===Reaching the Columbia===
Donald Stuart and his party of Robert McClellan, John Reed, Étienne Lucier, and seven other men continued to march ahead of the two main PFC groups. While traversing the lands of the Niimíipu, a stranded employee of the PFC, Archibald Pelton, was found and brought along with the party. They finally arrived at Fort Astoria on 18 January 1812. The party was described as clothed in &quot;nothing but fluttering rags.&quot; While waiting for the main contingent under Hunt to arrive, the men informed the personnel of the overland journey&#x27;s progress from St. Louis.

Hunt&#x27;s group found a band of Liksiyu on 8 January, whom hosted the downtrodden expedition for a week. Meals of dried mule deer meat and loafs of pounded Camas bulbs were provided during their stay. While exploring the area, Hunt found out from particular Liksiyu that there was an active white fur trader in the area. This would turn out to be Jacques Raphaël Finlay, located at the NWC Spokane House. On 21 January, the expedition finally reached the banks of the Columbia River. Hunt soon entered discussions with the Wasco-Wishram when entering their villages. It was here he learned the destruction of the &quot;Tonquin&quot; the previous year. The remaining three horses of the party were used to purchase two canoes from Wasco merchants. Several portages were required on the Columbia, especially at the Cascade Rapids. The main body of the expedition reached Fort Astoria on 15 February to much fanfare. Besides Hunt there was thirty men, along with Marie Aioe Dorion and her two children on six canoes. McDougall was apprehensive about feeding all these additional people, a sentiment Franchère shared, as the post had recently faced issues with provisions. Due to seasonal salmon runs harvested by various Chinookans however, there was a sizable food supply at Fort Astoria.

==Activities in 1812==

===Attempted expedition to interior===
In late March, three clerks in command of fourteen men were ordered to depart for the hinterlands. Robert Stuart was take needed trade goods to Fort Okanogan. John Reed was to take food supplies to the stranded Crooks and Day, in addition to later taking dispatches for Astor to St. Louis. Russel Farnham was to retrieve the caches left by Hunt near Fort Henry. To complete several of the necessary portages at the Dalles, Wascos were hired to help freight the trade goods. Two bales of trade goods and later some personal items were however stolen. Stuart ordered his men to complete the portages during the night. A skirmish arose at sunrise between arriving Wascos and Reed, who was defending several bales of goods with one man. After being grievously injured, Reed lost the box containing the dispatches. Additional PFC arrived at the scene and two natives were reportedly killed in the struggle. The Chinookans returned in larger numbers and armed several hours later. To avoid more bloodshed Stuart was able to negotiate a settlement with the aggrieved families. In return for a reported six blankets and tobacco, the Astorians were able to continue their journey up the Columbia.

The conflict raised security concerns of crossing into further Indigenous nations, forcing the three parties to all travel to Fort Okanogan. Arriving there on the 24th of April, the clerks, voyageurs and trappers departed for Fort Astoria on the 29th, leaving Alexander Ross and two men at the station. Stockpiles of pelts accumulated there amounted to an estimated 2,500 were taken as well. Near the mouth of the Umatilla River the party was surprised to loudly hear English shouted among an assembled group of Indigenous, perhaps Umatilla. Ramsay Crooks and John Day were there them, exhausted from several months of tribulations. Wandering over a large area, the two men at one point received the help of an Umatilla noble, Yeck-a-tap-am, who &quot;in particular treated us like a father.&quot; After being robbed by another band of Natives, Crooks and Day were able to find the Umatilla once more. Taking two worn men with them, the party reached Fort Astoria on 11 May.

===The &quot;Beaver&quot;===

The &quot;Beaver&quot; was the second supply ship sent by Astor to the Pacific Coast, with Cornelius Sowle as its captain. It sailed from New York City in October 1811 and reached Fort Astoria on 9 May 1812. While stopping at the Kingdom of Hawaii, more men were recruited as Kanakas for the company. After unloading necessary supplies to the Fort, the &quot;Beaver&quot; sailed to Russian America. Hunt joined the crew to negotiate with RAC governor Alexander Andreyevich Baranov at New Archangel. The cargo was purchased by the Russians amounted to ₽124,000 in value, with payment in seal skins located on Saint Paul Island. Orders from Astor dictated that the ship to return to the Columbia, but the &quot;Beaver&quot; was in poor repair and sailed for the Kingdom of Hawaii instead. Hunt was left there as the &quot;Beaver&quot; went west to Guangzhou. News of the War of 1812 kept the ship at the port for the remainder of the conflict. The &quot;Beaver&quot; then proceeded to New York City and entered the city harbor in 1816.

===Second interior expedition===
Failure to accomplish many of the tasks set for work the hinterland earlier in 1812 did not discourage the Astorians. The supplies and reinforcements brought aboard the &quot;Beaver&quot; made management consider &quot;grander schemes&quot; for the summer. New establishments would be created to challenge the NWC across the region in addition to pursuing trading expeditions among various Indigenous nations. A total of almost 60 men were directed to locations from the Willamette Valley of Oregon to the Bitterroot Valley of Montana and the vicinity of modern Kamloops in British Columbia. The movement of workers to their assigned locales began in late June. Robert Stuart led a party bound for St. Louis to send information to Astor as Reed had attempted earlier in the year. His group was composed two French-Canadians and four Americans. John Day became afflicted by mental instability and Stuart paid several Multnomah men of Cathlapotle village to transport him back to Fort Astoria. The group would make the important discovery of the South Pass, critical for the later westward movement of tens of thousands of American migrants.

==Liquidation==
Funds provided by Astor established several major trading stations across the Pacific Northwest. While intended to gain control of the regional fur trade, the Pacific Fur Company would ultimately flounder. This came from a variety of issues, many caused by the tumultuous diplomatic relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. The destruction of the &quot;Tonquin&quot; left Fort Astoria under supplied and heavily reliant upon neighboring Chinookans for sustenance. Competition from the interior based North West Company threatened to the loss of major fur producing Oregon Country regions. The Overland Expedition would arrive many months later than planned by Astor. Wilson Hunt&#x27;s inexperience in the outback in along with dwindling supplies would leave the majority of the expedition facing starvation.

While the arrival of the &quot;Beaver&quot; brought much needed trading goods, foodstuffs and additional employees, events would soon see the ending of the PFC. News of the War of 1812 was relayed to the Astorians at Fort Spokane, information that Donald McKenzie brought to Fort Astoria in January 1813. As Franchere recalled, a council of clerks and management noted that the Astorians were &quot;almost to a man British subjects&quot;, forcing them to agree to &quot;abandon the establishment&quot; of Fort Astoria and its secondary stations. A British warship was learned from NWC clerks to be en route to capture the station. The PFC management agreed to sell its assets across the Oregon Country, formalized on 23 October 1813 with the raising of the Union Jack. On 30 November arrived at the Columbia River and in honor of George III of the United Kingdom Fort Astoria was renamed Fort George. On board the &quot;Racoon&quot; was John MacDonald who oversaw the formal takeover of PFC properties. Later in March 1814, the NWC&#x27;s ship arrived on the Columbia, delivering much-needed supplies to Fort George. She then sailed on to China, and England. She carried some PFC personnel, many of whom were former employees of the NWC, back to England, from where they returned to Montreal.

==Legacy==
During a NWC shareholder meeting in July 1814, the partners declared that the sale &quot;greatly facilitated the getting out of the [Pacific] Country our competitors the American Fur Company. They also concluded that the sale of Astoria and other PFC properties gave &quot;considerable&quot; advancements for their company. Plans were considered to use the stations much in the same manner Astor meant, for trade with China. The Columbia also offered a less costly means of supplying the interior NWC posts in the region.

The Treaty of 1818 established a &quot;joint occupancy&quot; of the Pacific Northwest between the United States and the United Kingdom was confirmed, each nation agreeing not to inhibit the activities of each other&#x27;s citizens. During 1821, the British Government ordered the NWC to be merged in their long time rivals, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In a short time the HBC controlled the majority of the fur trade across the Pacific Northwest. This was done in a manner that &quot;the Americans were forced to acknowledge that Astor&#x27;s dream&quot; of a multi-continent economic web &quot;had been realized... by his enterprising and far-sighted competitors.&quot; The PFC held additional influence on the region in some particular and subtle ways. The book Astoria was written by Washington Irving in 1836, after interviewing some men connected to the venture and consulting documents held by Astor. Two surviving members of the Astorians, Étienne Lucier and Joseph Gervais, would later become farmers on the French Prairie and participate in the Champoeg Meetings.

<text>General quarters, battle stations, or action stations is an announcement made aboard a naval warship to signal that all hands (everyone available) aboard a ship must go to battle stations (the positions they are to assume when the vessel is in combat) as quickly as possible.

According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of War&quot;, formerly &quot;[i]n naval service, the phrase &#x27;beat to quarters&#x27; indicated a particular kind of drum roll that ordered sailors to their posts for a fight where some would load and prepare to fire the ship&#x27;s guns and others would arm with muskets and ascend the rigging as sharpshooters in preparation for combat.&quot;

Aboard U.S. Navy vessels, the following announcement would be made using the vessel’s public address system (known as the 1MC):

General Quarters, General Quarters. All hands man your battle stations. The route of travel is forward and up to starboard, down and aft to port. Set material condition &#x27;Zebra&#x27; throughout the ship. Reason for General Quarters: (Inbound hostile aircraft/Hostile surface contact/etc.)

<text>51826 Kalpanachawla (provisional designation ) is an Eoan asteroid in the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 19 July 2001, by astronomers of the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking program at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was named for Indo-American astronaut and mission specialist Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

== Orbit and classification ==
Kalpanachawla is a member the Eos family (), the largest family in the outer asteroid belt consisting of nearly 10,000 asteroids. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.8–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,968 days; semi-major axis of 3.07 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 10° with respect to the ecliptic.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak Observatory in April 1994, more than 7 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar.

== Physical characteristics ==
The asteroid&#x27;s spectral type is unknown. Members of the Eos family are typically K-type asteroids.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Kalpanachawla measures 6.947 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.160.

=== Rotation period ===
As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of Kalpanachawla has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid&#x27;s rotation period, poles and shape remain unknown.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named after Indo-American astronaut and mission specialist Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster on 1 February 2003. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 6 August 2003 (). The following asteroids were also named in memory of the other six members of STS-107: 51823 Rickhusband, 51824 Mikeanderson, 51825 Davidbrown, 51827 Laurelclark, 51828 Ilanramon and 51829 Williemccool.

<doc id="536633" wikidata="Q7008520" url="?curid=536633" title="New Haven Green">
<text>The New Haven Green is a privately owned park and recreation area located in the downtown district of the city of New Haven, Connecticut, United States. It comprises the central square of the nine-square settlement plan of the original Puritan colonists in New Haven, and was designed and surveyed by colonist John Brockett. Today the Green is bordered by the modern paved roads of College, Chapel, Church, and Elm streets. Temple Street bisects the Green into upper (northwest) and lower (southeast) halves.

The green is host to numerous public events, such as the International Festival of Arts and Ideas and New Haven Jazz Festival, summer jazz and classical music concerts that can draw hundreds of thousands of people, as well as typical daily park activities. The New Haven Green Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District for the architectural significance of the three 19th-century churches located there.

The New Haven Green is one of the oldest and most well-known town greens in the nation, dating back to at least 1638. As of July 2017, the City of New Haven offers free public WiFi on the Green.

==History==
The Green is a traditional town green (common) and was originally known as &quot;the marketplace&quot;. It was completed in 1638. The Puritans were said to have designed the green large enough to hold the number of people who they believed would be spared in the Second Coming of Christ: 144,000.

In its early years, the Green held a watch house, a prison and a school. The upper Green also once held the First Methodist Church. The church was removed from the Green in 1848 with a new church built across Elm Street (designed by Henry Austin). The Green also held a succession of statehouses, dating from the time when New Haven was joint capital of Connecticut with Hartford. The most recent state house was erected in 1837, designed by Ithiel Town in a Greek Revival style. Ultimately, Hartford was declared the sole capital and the building was demolished in 1889.

The Green served as the parade grounds for the New Haven militia, who, under the leadership of Benedict Arnold, rushed to Massachusetts after hearing of the Battle of Lexington and Concord and participated in the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American Revolution. This indirectly led to the burning of most of the city by the British when they landed in New Haven in 1779.

The Green was used as the main burial grounds for the residents of New Haven during its first 150 years, but by 1821 the practice was abolished and many of the headstones were moved to the Grove Street Cemetery. However, the remains of the dead were not moved, and thus still remain below the soil of the Green. It is conservatively estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000 people remain buried there, including Benedict Arnold&#x27;s first wife, members of President Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; family, Reverend James Pierpont (founder of Yale University), and Theophilus Eaton, one of the founders of New Haven and the church and governor of the New Haven Colony for 19 years.

On the evening of October 29, 2012, winds from Hurricane Sandy knocked over an oak tree on the Upper Green. Intertwined in the dirt and roots was a human skeleton. The police and medical examiner were called to the scene. The bones likely date back to colonial times, when the Green was used as a cemetery. The Grove Street cemetery that replaced it was chartered in 1797. A small portion of the burial ground is now preserved in The Center Church Crypt.

===The Committee of the Proprietors of Common and Undivided Lands at New Haven===
A self-electing group of private individuals, the Committee of the Proprietors of Common and Undivided Lands at New Haven, maintain ownership of the green. This five-member committee oversees the large, main portion of the green. The proprietors are drawn from the ranks of prominent city residents. Members are appointed for life, and when one dies the four remaining members convene to select a replacement.

==On the Green==
Located on the upper Green are three historic early 19th century churches which reflect the city&#x27;s theocratic roots. Two of the three churches are the work of the influential early-19th century architects Ithiel Town and Asher Benjamin, and one of them is the nation&#x27;s first large-scale Gothic Revival structure. Because of this architectural legacy, the green was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1970. The three churches are:

*&quot;United Church on the Green&quot; (United Church of Christ / Congregational), or &quot;North Church&quot;, was built in Federal style by David Hoadley in 1814.
*&quot;Center Church on the Green&quot;, or &quot;The First Church of Christ&quot; (United Church of Christ / Congregational) was established in 1639. The current church, designed in Georgian style by architect Ithiel Town, was built in 1812. The Center Church Crypt contains the identified remains of about 137 people, and the likely remains of over 1,000 that are unidentified. Sarah Rutherford Trowbridge has the oldest dated stone (1687) in the Crypt.
*&quot;Trinity Church on the Green&quot; is an Episcopal congregation founded in 1752, and was also designed by Ithiel Town in 1813, and built between 1814 and 1815. It is the first Gothic Style church identified in the United States. It was consecrated in 1816.
In the lower Green are the Bennett Fountain (built in 1907 and designed after the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens) and the flagpole with granite World War I memorial (designed by Douglas Orr in 1928) and fountain (added in 2003).

While once the edges of the Green were covered with a glorious canopy of elms, planted originally by James Hillhouse, most died of dutch elm disease. In the 1980s, through the efforts of the Garden Club of New Haven, disease-resistant elms were planted in an attempt to memorialize the legacy of the trees that gave New Haven the nickname &quot;Elm City&quot;.

==Around the Green==

Bordering the Green are municipal, commercial and university structures. On the northwest side of the Green, across College Street, stand Phelps Gate and the Yale University buildings bordering Old Campus. Before the Old Campus was built, the buildings of Yale&#x27;s Old Brick Row bordered the Green here. On the southwest side along Chapel Street are stores, bars, and such popular restaurants as Claire&#x27;s Corner Copia. On the southeast side of the green, across Church Street is The Exchange Building (1832, restored in 1990) and the Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse (James Gamble Rogers, 1913). This was once the site of the Tontine Hotel, built by David Hoadley. New Haven&#x27;s Victorian City Hall (by Henry Austin in 1861; restored and added to by Herbert S. Newman and Partners) and the Amistad Memorial are also at this end of the Green. The memorial stands on the site of the jail that held the Amistad captives during their time in New Haven. Spectators came to see them when they were brought out to exercise on the Green and paid 12 and a half cents to view them in the jail.

Opposite the eastern corner of the lower green is the Union and New Haven Trust Building (now Wells Fargo and The Union apartments) designed by Cross and Cross in colonial revival style in 1927. The design is a tribute to the federal churches on the green and even borrows the cupola from the United Church. On the northeast side along Elm Street by the lower Green is the New Haven Free Public Library (Cass Gilbert, 1908). The library was once the site of the Bristol House, also designed by David Hoadley, whose doorway is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
Next to the library is the Beaux-Arts, neoclassical New Haven County Courthouse. The courthouse was designed by New Haven architects William Allen and Richard Williams, modeled after St. George&#x27;s Hall in Liverpool, England. The statuary in front of the courthouse is by the sculptor J. Massey Rhind and murals and lunettes inside the courthouse are by the painter T. Thomas Gilbert.

The upper Green on Elm is bordered by &quot;Quality Row&quot;, containing some of the oldest structures in New Haven: the federal style white clapboard Nicholas Callahan house, once a tavern (now the Yale Elihu Senior Society), the federal Eli W. Blake House (now the Graduate Club), the federal John Pierpont house (now the Yale University Koerner Center) built in 1767 and the brick Greek Revival Governor Ralph Isaacs Ingersoll House, designed in 1829 by Town and Davis.

<doc id="536636" wikidata="Q5099114" url="?curid=536636" title="Chilly Beach">
<text>Chilly Beach is a Canadian animated sitcom that aired on CBC from 2003 to 2006. The series is a comedic depiction of life in the fictional Canadian town of Chilly Beach, described by the producers as &quot;a bunch of Canadians doing the stuff that Canadians do, like playing hockey, drinking beer, and being eaten by polar bears.&quot; &quot;Chilly Beach&quot; plays on nearly every conceivable stereotype that people have about Canadians in a satirical manner. 65 episodes were produced over three seasons.

The first iterations of the concept began in 1998 as a cartoon demonstration for Daniel Hawe&#x27;s firm Infopreneur. The show launched in 2000 as an animated Flash site on the Web with short episodes made available for free on its website. It was later developed into a CBC TV series which first aired in 2003. An early version of the &quot;Chilly Beach&quot; feature film, &quot;The World Is Hot Enough&quot;, made its theatrical debut at Cinéfest in September 2005, and was released to DVD on February 4, 2008. A second film, &quot;Chilly Beach: The Canadian President&quot; was also produced.

Guest stars on the show have included William Shatner, Joe Flaherty, Leslie Nielsen, Elvis Stojko, Lawrence Gowan and David Suzuki. The show was produced in Sudbury, Ontario by March Entertainment. In 2011, the series launched in the U.S. on the streaming video website Hulu; the series had also been available on iTunes. A tie-in browser game was also produced called &quot;Beach Hunt&quot;.

==Characters==
Main characters
* Dale MacDonald (voiced by Steve Ashton) is a stupid and fat stereotypical Canadian. He has a crush on April June, who detests Dale, and has a best friend, Frank Shackleford, whose genius would go more appreciated if Dale didn&#x27;t accidentally destroy most of his brilliant inventions with a stray puck. He owns a Zamboni and considers ice resurfacing a skilled trade. Devoted fan of hockey, especially his favourite team the Montreal Tourtières, in direct opposition to Frank&#x27;s support of the Toronto Ptarmigans.
* Frank Shackleford (voiced by Todd Peterson) is a beer store manager and Dale&#x27;s best friend. Also a modest scientific genius; he once created a portal to another galaxy. He holds a PhD in physics, but chooses to run a beer store because &quot;physicists don&#x27;t get two-fours on weekends&quot;.
* Jacques LaRock (voiced by Robert Smith) is an unhygienic (yet somewhat incompetent) greasy spoon owner and former hockey player from Quebec who serves a poutine made from a recipe passed down from his mother.
* April June (voiced by Samantha Espie) is a waitress and ferocious animal rights activist. Dale is constantly trying to get her to date him, but she resolutely remains uninterested.
* Angus MacAuger is an eccentric and hermetic Scottish trapper
* Katherine Hilderbrand (voiced by Mary Lawliss) is the disgruntled (and highly patriotic) Assistant Deputy American Ambassador to Canada
* Abby Hilderbrand (voiced by Emily Tait) is Katherine&#x27;s inquisitive and intelligent daughter. She is an aspiring anthropologist constantly trying to understand Canadian culture.
* Constable Al (voiced by Damon D&#x27;Oliveira) is an Indo-Canadian mountie, the only form of law enforcement in Chilly Beach usually found riding his police horse.
* Michel Mabuis (voiced by Jacqueline Pillon) is the nephew of Jacques LaRock, a friend of Abby who enjoys figure skating, a fact he has to hide from his hockey-obsessed uncle who considers figure skating weak.
* Polar Bear a large animal who frequently eats citizens of Chilly Beach, somehow has with a pleasant British accent, and lives with a taciturn penguin

:The characters Abby and Michel were deemed unpopular after season one, and largely disappeared from the show in subsequent seasons.

Minor characters
* Antoine DelVecchio (voiced by Joe Flaherty) is Chilly Beach&#x27;s corrupt and incompetent Member of Parliament.
* Lucretia Marinara (voiced by Andrea Martin) is the local butcher and girlfriend of Jacques LaRock.
* Panic Man is a completely unnamed character who shows up regularly only to panic at whatever is happening and run off.
* The President (voiced by William Shatner) is an unnamed President of the United States. At one point he tells the President of Generistan to call him &quot;Henry&quot;.
* Dave Macdonald is Dale&#x27;s perfect and well-loved older brother who appears in only one episode. He is the total opposite of Dale. He came to Chilly Beach hoping Dale would give him a kidney in order to live. However is turns out their blood types are incompatible, so one of them was actually adopted. He got his new kidney thanks to Frank, who was tied up and gagged by Dale. Apparently, he&#x27;s from Saskatoon.

==Setting==
Chilly Beach is a small town located on a large iceberg, presumably in the Canadian Arctic. The iceberg is seemingly a floating island that can move around in the water. There are some trees and wildlife as well as a mountain with caves. According to at least one episode, the island is located in northwestern Hudson Bay, placing it in Nunavut. However where it is has been kept vague as it has been mentioned that they live in a province and in season 1, episode 15 are not actually a part of Canada.

<doc id="536637" wikidata="Q841680" url="?curid=536637" title="Fukuoka–Kitakyushu">
<text>is the most common name given to the region comprising the metropolitan areas of the cities of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan and in between. Alternate names are many, including Kitakyushu-Fukuoka Greater Metropolitan Region (北九州・福岡大都市圏), Northern Part of Kyushu Greater Metropolitan Region (北部九州大都市圏)

One reason for complications in naming is because the whole region itself was once referred to as &quot;Kitakyushu&quot;, which had become ambiguous after the city merger in 1963 which created the city by the same name.

These cities may be referred to separately, but often are lumped together since they are close and lie in the same prefecture. Furthermore, their economic spheres, infrastructure, and transport links overlap. Note that the metro areas include the tip of Honshu island (Shimonoseki on Honshu is a significant suburb of Kitakyushu), as well as the northern part of Kyushu. The definition of Northern Kyushu is not a superset of Fukuoka–Kitakyushu; among the ways it differs: it generally does not include any cities on Honshu island.

==Definition==
The region consists of the following areas:

* The Ube region may or may not be considered part of this region, depending on definition
* Note: The cities of Ōita, Sasebo, Kumamoto are never included as being part of Fukuoka–Kitakyushu, despite their relative proximity to Fukuoka and Kitakyushu, rather, they are part of Northern Kyūshū.

==Trends==
There is a trend for concentration near Fukuoka, with the other areas declining in importance.

<doc id="536638" wikidata="Q891771" url="?curid=536638" title="Bomb vessel">
<text>A bomb vessel, bomb ship, bomb ketch, or simply bomb was a type of wooden sailing naval ship. Its primary armament was not cannons (long guns or carronades) – although bomb vessels carried a few cannons for self-defence – but mortars mounted forward near the bow and elevated to a high angle, and projecting their fire in a ballistic arc. Explosive shells (also called &quot;bombs&quot; at the time) or carcasses were employed rather than solid shot. Bomb vessels were specialized ships designed for bombarding (hence the name) fixed positions on land. In the 20th century, this naval gunfire support role was carried out by the most similar purpose-built World War I- and II-era monitors, but also by other warships now firing long-range explosive shells.

==Development==
The first recorded deployment of bomb vessels by the English was for the siege of Calais in 1347 when Edward III deployed single-deck ships with bombardes and other artillery. The first specialised bomb vessels were built towards the end of the 17th century, based on the designs of Bernard Renau d&#x27;Eliçagaray, and used by the French Navy. They were first called &quot;galiote à bombe&quot; (a word derived from the Dutch galliot, denoting a short, beamy vessel well suited for the powerful downward recoil of its weapons). Five such vessels were used to shell Algiers in 1682 destroying the land forts, and killing some 700 defenders. Two years later the French repeated their success at Genoa. The early French bomb vessels had two forward-pointing mortars fixed side-by-side on the foredeck. To aim these weapons, the entire ship was rotated by letting out or pulling in a spring anchor. The range was usually controlled by adjusting the gunpowder charge. The French later adopted the word &quot;bombarde&quot; for this vessel, but it should not be confused with the horizontal fire, stone throwing bombard of earlier centuries.

The French design was copied by the Royal Navy, who continued to refine the class over the next century or more, after Huguenot exiles brought designs over to England and the United Provinces. The side-by-side, forward-pointing mortars were replaced in the British designs by mortars mounted on the centerline on revolving platforms. These platforms were supported by strong internal wooden framework to transmit the forces of firing the weapons to the hull. The interstices of the framework were used as storage areas for ammunition.
Early bomb vessels were rigged as ketches with two masts. They were awkward vessels to handle, in part because bomb ketches typically had the masts stepped farther aft than would have been normal in other vessels of similar rig, in order to accommodate the mortars forward and provide a clear area for their forwards fire. As a result, by the 1800s British bomb vessels were designed as full-rigged ships with three masts, and two mortars, one between each neighboring pair of masts. The full rig also meant that bomb vessels could be used as escort sloops between bombardment missions; in 1805 the Acheron bomb along with the Arrow sloop were both lost in a defence of their convoy. Bomb vessels often had the front rigging made of chain, to better withstand the muzzle blast of the mortars.

Mortars were the only kind of naval armament to fire explosive shells rather than solid shot until the invention of the Paixhans gun. Since it was considered dangerous to have large stocks of shells on board the ships that were firing them, and because the reinforced mortar platforms occupied so much space below decks, bomb vessels were usually accompanied by a tender to carry ammunition as well as the ordnance officers in charge of firing the mortars. However, as naval warfare became more advanced, bomb ships were also accompanied by frigates to protect them from direct assault by faster, smaller vessels.

Bomb vessels were traditionally named after volcanoes, or given other names suggestive of explosive qualities. Some were also given names associated with the underworld. Vessels of other types which were later converted to bomb ships generally retained their original names.

Bomb vessels were highly specialized and expensive to fit out and maintain, and only marginally suited for their secondary role as cruisers. Because bomb vessels were built with extremely strong hulls to withstand the recoil of the mortars, several were converted in peacetime as ships for exploration of the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where pack ice and icebergs were a constant menace. Most famously, these ships included and . In this case, the volcanoes – Mount Erebus and Mount Terror on Ross Island in Antarctica – were named after the ships, instead of vice versa.
Although horizontal fire naval guns propelling explosive shells had entered all major navies by the 1840s (see Paixhans gun), there was still room for a specialized vessel on occasion. During the American Civil War, the Union fleet included armored gunboats armed with 13 inch mortars; the weapon weighed 17,250 lbs and its bedding another 4,500 lbs. They fired 204-lb shells, with a bursting charge of 7 lbs of gunpowder, and had a range of three miles. At this distance, the projectile spent 30 seconds in flight. They were used to attack several forts, for example Fort Pulaski, Georgia.

==Notable bomb vessels and actions==
* The bomb vessels and were further strengthened for an expedition of discovery to the North Pole in the 1770s. The uncompleted expedition included a young Horatio Nelson.
* Bomb vessels , &quot;Explosion&quot;, &quot;Hecla&quot;, &quot;Sulphur&quot;, &quot;Terror&quot; (1784), &quot;Volcano&quot;, and participated in the First Battle of Copenhagen in 1801.
* , &quot;Vesuvius&quot;, , and participated in the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807.
* and additionally participated in the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1808 (this action was also notable for including three rocket vessels in support of the bombs).
* The &quot;bombs bursting in air&quot; recorded by Francis Scott Key at the Battle of Baltimore in 1814 were provided by the , , , , and a new .
* Another and her sister ship were used by William Edward Parry on a series of voyages to the Arctic between 1819 and 1827.
* During the Battle of Veracruz in 1838, the bomb vessels &quot;Cyclope&quot; and &quot;Vulcain&quot; fired most of the shells used by the French, and scored decisive hits on Mexican ammunition depots.
* and served as polar exploration vessels. &quot;Terror&quot; had been used by George Back in his 1836 Arctic expedition, in Sir James Clark Ross&#x27;s own expedition of 1840 to the Antarctic, before they were lost on Sir John Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition of 1845.

==In fiction==
&quot;Commodore Hornblower&quot; (published 1945), a Horatio Hornblower novel written by C. S. Forester, features several actions by British bomb vessels. The text includes a highly detailed account of the procedures used to load the mortars and aim, which involved anchoring fore-and-aft, receiving range corrections from another vessel, precisely adjusting the aim using an anchor cable attached to a windlass, and by using fine adjustments in the amount of gun powder to correct the range. However, Forester erred in describing the vessels as ketches, which by the early 19th century had been replaced by full-rigged ships, and in assigning the management of the mortars to Naval officers, rather than the Royal Marine Artillery which had been formed for this specific purpose. A later book, &quot;Hornblower in the West Indies&quot;, features a small portable &quot;ship&#x27;s mortar&quot; mounted in a boat, used to bombard a target during a riverine operation.

In a fictionalized account, war correspondent, author, and yachtsman G. A. Henty describes in vivid detail the deployment of ten bomb-ketches by the Spanish besiegers during the final period of the siege of Gibraltar.

In &quot;The Ramage Touch&quot; by Dudley Pope (published 1979), Captain Lord Ramage and the crew of the frigate &quot;Calypso&quot; capture two bomb ketches, which they subsequently use to thwart a French invasion plan in the Mediterranean. Like the Hornblower books, The Ramage Touch describes in great detail the technical aspects of employing a bomb vessel during the Napoleonic era.

In &quot;H.M.S. Cockerell&quot; by Dewey Lambdin (published 1995), First Lieutenant Alan Lewrie is set ashore by his vindictive captain, for &#x27;land service&#x27; during the siege of Toulon. There Admiral Goodall gives him a bomb ketch, which he commands for several weeks until it is blown out of the water and sunk by a young Colonel of artillery named Buonaparte.

<doc id="536639" wikidata="Q656619" url="?curid=536639" title="Tag (game)">
<text>Tag (also called chase, tig, it, tiggy, tips, tick, on-on and tip) is a playground game involving one or more players chasing other players in an attempt to &quot;tag&quot; and mark them out of play, typically by touching with a hand. There are many variations; most forms have no teams, scores, or equipment. Usually when a person is tagged, the tagger says, &quot;It!&quot; or &quot;Tag, you&#x27;re &#x27;It&#x27;!&quot; The last one tagged during tag is &quot;It&quot; for the next round. The game is known by other names in various parts of the world, including &quot;running and catching&quot; in India and &quot;catch and cook&quot; in the Middle East.

==Origin of name==

The game has many different names in different parts of the UK: &#x27;tig&#x27; in Yorkshire and Scotland, &#x27;tick&#x27; in the North West of England, and &#x27;it&#x27; in the South of England. In the United States the game is usually called &#x27;tag&#x27;, and in Australia it is sometimes called &#x27;tips&#x27;.

In 2018, the internet meme &quot;How old were you when you found out ____&quot; began circulating, which stated that the origin of the word &quot;tag&quot; was an acronym meaning &#x27;touch and go&#x27;. Investigation by snopes.com found this to be false. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the origin of the name &#x27;tag&#x27; is unknown, while the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; speculates it to be a variant of &#x27;tig&#x27;, which itself is possibly a variant of &#x27;tick&#x27;.

==History==
Tag-like games have been played throughout history since as far back as the fourth century BC. The Ancient Greek poet Erinna, in her poem &quot;The Distaff&quot;, speaks of a tag-like game where one kid, the &quot;tortoise&quot;, chases other kids, and the tagged kid becomes the new &quot;tortoise&quot;. (See also: Ostracinda) 

=== Indian variations of tag ===

* Kho-kho has been played since at least the fourth century BC. Certain aspects of kho-kho and kabaddi are believed to have been mentioned in the Mahabharata, around 300 AD or before.
* Atya-patya, which goes by several other names (such as Klithatu), was also mentioned as early as 300 AD or before in the Naṟṟiṇai.
* Langdi is believed to have been played in the Pandya dynasty, over a thousand years ago.

Some Indian variations of tag are theorized to represent certain things from ancient Indian history; for example, there is evidence to suggest that the traditional Bengali game of gollachut, in which players attempt to run out of a circular field without being tagged by opponents, may represent escape attempts by agricultural slaves during the Indus Valley Civilization.

=== Modern history ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was noted that children around the world started to play variations of tag which involved roleplaying spreading coronavirus.

==== Tag competitions ====

Major modern competitions for tag-like games (&quot;major competitions&quot; being those with at least 100 million views) include World Chase Tag, Pro Kabaddi League, and Ultimate Kho Kho. As for tag variants being included in prestigious events, kabaddi has found its way into the Asian Games, and is also in the South Asian Games alongside kho-kho; both games have been proposed by the Indian government to be part of the 2036 Olympics.

==Basic rules==

Players (two or more) decide who is going to be &quot;it&quot;, often using a counting-out game such as eeny, meeny, miny, moe or rock paper scissors. The player selected to be &quot;it&quot; then chases the others, attempting to &quot;Tag&quot; one of them (by touching them with the palm of a hand) as the others try to avoid being tagged. A tag makes the tagged player &quot;it&quot;. In some variations, the previous &quot;it&quot; is no longer &quot;it&quot; and the game can continue indefinitely, while in others, both players remain &quot;it&quot; and the game ends when all players have become &quot;it&quot;. This variation of the game is sometimes called &quot;Family tip&quot;.

Many variants modify the rules for team play or place restrictions on tagged players&#x27; behavior. A simple variation makes tag an elimination game, so that tagged players drop out of play. Some variants have a rule preventing a player from tagging the person who has just tagged them (known as &quot;no tag-backs&quot;, &quot;no catch-backs&quot;, &quot;no returns&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t tag your master&quot; or &quot;can&#x27;t get the butcher back&quot;).

===Base and truce terms===
Players may be safe from being tagged under certain circumstances: if they are within a pre-determined area, off the ground, or when touching a particular structure. Traditional variants are Wood tag (see knock on wood), Iron tag, and Stone tag, when a player is safe when touching the named material. Though in most cases you will be able to stay in that pre-determined area for however long you would like, such as “house rules” including that feature. This safe zone has been called a &quot;gool&quot;, &quot;ghoul&quot;, or &quot;Dell&quot;, probably a corruption of &quot;goal&quot;. The term &quot;gool&quot; was first recorded in print in Massachusetts in the 1870s, and is common in the northern states of the US. Variants include gould, goul, and ghoul, and alternatives include base and home. In the United Kingdom, the base is frequently known as &quot;den&quot;. In much of Canada and parts of the northern United States, the state or home base of being immune from tagging is known as &quot;times&quot; or &quot;T&quot;, most likely as mutilation of &quot;time out&quot;.

Players may also make themselves safe from being tagged by the use of a truce term. When playing the game tag, some may cross fingers to let others know that they, the player, cannot be it. Yet, this rule may come into play only if the crossing of fingers is shown; if the fingers are not shown to the person who is it, then the crossing does not count.

If you tag the person who is currently &#x27;it&#x27; you effectively make yourself it.

===Alternative terminology===
In some parts of Scotland, instead of saying &quot;Tag, you&#x27;re &#x27;It&#x27;!&quot;, the call is &quot;Tig, you&#x27;re het!&quot;

In India, the player who is &quot;it&quot; is referred to as the &quot;denner&quot;.

=== Deciding who is &quot;it&quot; ===
In addition to games like rock paper scissors that can be used to decide who is &quot;it&quot;, some other methods are used in different parts of the world:

* In parts of Asia, variations of a game known as &quot;pugam pugai&quot; or Saa Boo Three in India are played; in one variation, a group of three players are asked to face one of their hands upward or downward, and if one of them faces their hand in the opposite direction of the other two players, then that player is eliminated. This process then repeats with other players until finally, the last player eliminated in the final group of three is made to be &quot;it&quot;.
* All of the players put their foot in a circle, and the last player to withdraw their foot from the circle is &quot;it&quot;.

==Bans and restrictions==
Tag and other chasing games have been banned in some schools in the United States due to concerns about injuries, complaints from children that it can lead to harassment and bullying, and that there is an aspect to the game that possesses an unhealthily predatory element to its nature. In 2008, a 10-year-old boy in Omaha, Nebraska, died from brain injuries suffered from falling onto a metal pole while playing tag. A school dinner lady in Dorset was left partially paralyzed after a boy playing tag ran into her in 2004; her damage claim was rejected by three Court of Appeal judges, who ruled that the boy had not broken any school rules by playing the game. In 2019, Joanne Smith, the headteacher of Rudyard Kipling Primary School &amp; Nursery, banned the game of tag because it was too rough.

A principal who banned tag in her school criticized the game for creating a &quot;self-esteem issue&quot; in nominating one child as a victim, and noted that the oldest and biggest children usually dominate the game. A dislike of elimination games is another reason for banning tag. In some schools only supervised tag is allowed, sometimes with a type of tagging called butterfly tagging—a light tap on the shoulders, arms or upper back.

The president of the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education said that &quot;tag games are not inherently bad... teachers must modify rules, select appropriate boundaries and equipment, and make sure pupils are safe. Teachers should emphasize tag games that develop self-improvement, participation, fair play, and cooperation.&quot;

==Variants==


===British bulldog===

One (or two players) starts as &quot;bulldog&quot;, who stands in the middle of the playing area, while the other players stand at one end of the area. The aim is to run from one end of the area to the other without being caught by the bulldog. When a player is caught, they become the bulldog themself. The last player is the winner and starts as &quot;bulldog&quot; in the next game.

==== Octopus tag ====
In Octopus the playing field is known as ocean. The players, or &quot;fishes&quot;, line up along one side of the ocean. When the Octopus calls out, &quot;Come fishies come!&quot;, &quot;Octopus!&quot;, or a matching attribute of one or more fishes, they try to run to the other side without getting tagged. In a variation, once the fish run to the other side without getting tagged, the game pauses until the octopus starts it again. Upon getting tagged the fish become &quot;seaweed&quot; and must freeze or sit where they were tagged, but they can wave their arms around and assist the Octopus in tagging other fish within their reach. The last fish to be tagged becomes the next Octopus.

=== Cat and mouse ===
=== Chaos tag ===
In chaos tag (also known as &quot;ultimate tag&quot; or &quot;ultimate it&quot;), any player may tag any other player. When a player is tagged they are declared &quot;down&quot; and must sit down where they were tagged. Any players that the &quot;down&quot; player tagged become &quot;up&quot; and begin tagging others. The game ends when all but one player is &quot;down&quot;. Since two players often tag each other at the same time, this variant is especially prone to dispute. One version allows players to form alliances that dissolve once everyone but the allies are &quot;down&quot;. Another makes the players play rock paper scissors. The loser becomes &quot;down&quot; and the winner plays on.
=== Chhi-chhattar ===
One player, known as the &quot;kite&quot;, starts off inside a circle formed by all of the other players (&quot;cocks&quot;) holding hands, and then breaks free, with the first of the other players to tag the kite becoming the kite in the next round of play.

=== Colored Ogre ===
The variant is played in Japan and starts by having the &quot;it&quot; player, called the , announce a color; in some cases, the other players prompt the ogre by first asking &quot;what are the different colors?&quot; As soon as the ogre declares a color, the other players hurry to touch an object of that color, which makes them safe; customarily, there is a short delay of 10 seconds or less before the ogre may begin pursuing the others. In general, each player being pursued must find a separate object to touch, i.e., two or more players cannot be touching the same object, but some rule variations allow multiple players to touch the same object.

The first player caught and touched by the ogre before that player can touch the designated color becomes the ogre for the next round; alternatively, the ogre role may be rotated amongst the participants after a set number of rounds. If all players touch the color before the ogre can catch anyone, the ogre role does not change, and they then announce a new color. The game is best played in an environment with a variety of colors, such as a playground, and an impartial referee may be needed to judge disputes, e.g., if a specific object being touched matches the declared color. To increase the difficulty, an object may be added to the color declaration; for example, the ogre could call out &quot;green park bench&quot;.

=== Cross tag ===
In cross tag (also known as turn tag), if &quot;it&quot; is chasing somebody and then a third person runs in between, then &quot;it&quot; must chase the third person.

===Duck, duck, goose===
In this game, usually played by young children, the players sit in a circle facing inward. One player, the &quot;picker&quot; or &quot;fox&quot;, walks around tapping or pointing to each player in turn, calling each of them a &quot;duck&quot;, until finally announcing one of their choosing to be the &quot;goose&quot;. The goose then rises and runs around the circle in the same direction as the picker, attempting to return to their seat before the &quot;picker&quot; can sit back down in the vacated spot. In Minnesota, this game is referred to as &quot;Duck, duck, gray duck&quot;.

=== Elbow tag ===
This variant is played on a circular field, with an inner circle and outer boundary being demarcated. At the start of the game, two of the players become a cat and mouse respectively, with all other players becoming pitchers. All of the pitchers pair off and stand around the perimeter of the inner circle, with each pair holding each other by the elbow. The cat&#x27;s goal is to tag the mouse; if the mouse links their elbow with one of the pitchers, then the pitcher who is not connected to the mouse disconnects from the pairing and swaps roles with the mouse. If the cat catches the mouse, then they swap roles.

In one variation of elbow tag, when a mouse links their elbow with one of the pitchers, the pitcher who disconnects from the pairing becomes a cat, and the previous cat becomes a mouse.

The same game is known as &#x27;standing kho-kho&#x27; in South Asia, a variation of the Indian tag variant kho-kho. In the &#x27;standing kho-kho&#x27; variant, players simply stand in front of or behind each other as opposed to hooking their elbows together.

=== Four corners ===

There are multiple variations of four corners; in one variation, four players stand at four corners of a square, and attempt to swap corners with each other without being tagged by &quot;it&quot;, who stands in the middle of the square.

====Tiger====

Players stand or sit in a circle and attempt to run to the other side. One person stands in the middle and is &quot;it&quot; or &quot;tiger&quot;. If the &quot;tiger&quot; catches you, you then become the new &quot;tiger&quot;.
===Freeze tag===
Freeze tag is a variation of classic tag. A player is deemed &quot;it.&quot; When a person is tagged by &quot;it&quot;, they are then &quot;frozen&quot; (staying still in the place where they were tagged). All &quot;unfrozen&quot; players still in play can then touch frozen players to &quot;unfreeze&quot; them, allowing them to be back in play. The game ends when &quot;it&quot; freezes all but one of the players who is then typically &quot;it&quot; during the next game. In some variations of the game, there may be multiple players who are &quot;it&quot; working together. Similar games are played that are known as Vish Amrut/Vish Amrit (Poison-Antidote), Lock and Key, Ice and Water, Banana Tag and Stuck in the Mud.

==== Squat tag ====
Players can make themselves safe from being tagged in squat tag by squatting down, though in order to stand back up again, a teammate has to tag the squatting player.

=== Hang tag ===
In hang tag, players are safe from being tagged so long as they are hanging off the ground by holding onto something above them, such as a tree branch.

===Kiss chase===

Kiss chase, also referred to as Catch and Kiss, is a tag variant in which tagging is performed by kissing. All members of one sex are &quot;it&quot; at once and chase players of the opposite sex until everyone is caught, then the roles are reversed. A variant is that the player chosen to be &quot;it&quot; will, with assistance from players of the same gender, chase all members of the opposite sex and kiss one of them.

=== Kumir danga ===
In this Indian game, all of the players stay in a designated area (&quot;land&quot;), while &quot;it&quot; (who is referred to as a &quot;crocodile&quot;) stands outside of that area in the &quot;water&quot;, and cannot step onto land. The players try to run between the water and the land without being tagged.

===Poison===

In the game of Poison, play starts with players holding hands around a small &quot;poison&quot; circle marked on the ground. The first player to be pushed or pulled into the circle become &quot;poisoned&quot;, all hands are released and the poisoned player or players must chase the others.

===River or mountain===

In River or Mountain (also referred to as Nadi-Parvat in India), designated areas of the field are referred to as &quot;river&quot; or &quot;mountain&quot;. The player who is &quot;it&quot; shouts &quot;river&quot; or &quot;mountain&quot;, and the other players must go to the area called out. While outside of that area, the players can be tagged and eliminated.

=== Shadow tag ===
Instead of touching other players, &quot;it&quot; tries to step on their shadows to tag them.

=== The floor is lava ===

In one variation of &quot;The floor is lava&quot;, the players must avoid stepping on the floor by staying on raised platforms, while &quot;it&quot; (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lava Monster&quot;) can walk across the floor and attempt to tag other players.

=== Tilo-Express ===
Tilo-Express is a variant of hide-and-seek in which the seeker loses if they are tagged by an opponent that they have not spotted.

==Team tag==

=== Chicken vs eagle ===
In this game, one player is the eagle, another player is the chicken, and the remaining players are chicks. The chicks form a line behind the chicken by holding each other&#x27;s waists, and the goal of the eagle is to tag the chicks, while the chicken tries to prevent this by holding their arms out and moving around. Throughout the game, the chicks must stay in the line formation, and if one of them is tagged, then they become the eagle.

=== Catch the dragon&#x27;s tail ===
All the players line up by holding each other&#x27;s waists, with the player in the front known as the &quot;dragon&quot;, and the player in the back known as the &quot;tail&quot;. The goal of the dragon is to tag the tail, while all other players aim to prevent this by moving around. The players must stay in the line formation throughout the game, and once the dragon tags the tail, the players all move up one spot, with the former dragon now at the back of the line.

===Cops and robbers===

Cops and robbers, sometimes called &quot;jail&quot;, &quot;jail tag&quot;, &quot;team tag&quot;, &quot;chase&quot;, &quot;cowboys and Indians&quot;, &quot;police and thief&quot;, &quot;prisoner&#x27;s base&quot; &quot;jailbreak&quot;, &quot;releaseo&quot; or &quot;manhunt&quot;, has players split into two teams: cops and robbers.

A. M. Burrage calls this version of the game &quot;Smee&quot; in his 1931 ghost story of the same name. The cops, who are in pursuit of robbers (the team being chased), arrest the robbers by tagging the robbers and putting them in jail. Robbers can stage a jailbreak by tagging one of the prisoners in the jail without getting tagged themselves. The game ends if all the robbers are in jail. In a variant, the robbers have five minutes to hide before being hunted, and only one jailbreak may be allowed per robber. In the 2017 racing game &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, a variation of the game is used as a sub-mode for Battle Mode known as &quot;Renegade Roundup&quot;.

===Zombie tag===

Humans vs. Zombies is a survival game of tag, where &quot;human&quot; players fight off increasingly large numbers of &quot;zombies&quot;; if a human is &quot;turned&quot; (i.e. tagged), then that player also becomes a zombie. At the game&#x27;s beginning, there are only one or two zombies; the zombies multiply by tagging humans, turning them into zombies after a period of one hour. Humans can defend themselves from zombies by using socks, marshmallows, Nerf Blasters or any other toys deemed safe and appropriate; if a zombie is hit by one of these, they are stunned (not allowed to interact with the game in any way) for 15 seconds. The goal of the zombies is to turn all the humans; the humans, meanwhile, must outlast all the zombies.

===Manhunt===
Manhunt is a mixture of hide and seek and tag, often played during the night. One person is &quot;it&quot;, while the other players have to hide. Then, the person who is &quot;it&quot; tries to find and tag them. The game is over when all players are out. Manhunt is sometimes played in teams. In one variant there is a home base in which a player is safe. That version ends when all players who are not safe are out.

===Prisoner&#x27;s base===
In prisoner&#x27;s base, each team starts in a chain, holding hands, with one end of the chain touching the base. The end two players on each team break from the chain and try to tag each other, taking them to their base if they do. The end pair progressively break from the chain and join the tagging. As with Cops and Robbers, prisoners can be freed by tagging them in the base. The game is thought to date back to the Renaissance period, and may be inspired by the act of bride kidnapping. A game of prisoner&#x27;s base was played by members of Lewis &amp; Clark&#x27;s Corps of Discovery against a group of Nez Perce.

=== Chain tag ===
In chain tag (also known in India as Jod Saakli or Saakli/Saakhli), one player is &quot;it&quot; and attempts to tag other players. Each tagged player becomes &quot;it&quot; as well, with all of the &quot;it&quot; players required to form and remain in a human chain by holding hands. Only the two players at either end of the chain can tag other players. The game ends once all players have been tagged, with the last person tagged being the winner.

===What&#x27;s the time, Mr. Wolf?===

One player is chosen to be Mr. Wolf and stands facing away from the other players at the opposite end of the playing field. All players except Mr. Wolf chant in unison &quot;What&#x27;s the time, Mr. Wolf?&quot;, and Mr. Wolf will answer in one of two ways: Mr. Wolf may call a time – usually an hour ending in &quot;o&#x27;clock&quot;. The other players take that many steps towards Mr. Wolf. They then ask the question again. Alternatively Mr. Wolf may call &quot;Dinner time!&quot;, and turn and chase the other players back to their starting point. If Mr. Wolf tags a player, that player becomes Mr. Wolf for the next round.

===Ringolevio===

In Ringolevio, there are two teams. In one version, one team goes off and hides. The other team counts to a number such as 30 and then goes looking for them. Each team has its own &quot;jail&quot;, a park bench or other defendable area in another version. The game goes on until all of one team is in jail. In many ways, Ringolevio is similar to Prisoner&#x27;s Base.

=== Hens-Vipers-Foxes ===
There are three teams in this game: the hens, vipers, and foxes, with each team having its own designated area (&quot;camp&quot;). Each team can tag players of one of the other teams (i.e. hens can tag vipers, vipers tag foxes, and foxes tag hens) to imprison them within the tagging team&#x27;s camp, with the prisoners only able to be freed by a tag from the third team.

=== Gella-Chutt ===
=== Gollachut ===
In Gollachut, one team starts off in the center of a circle, and each of its players attempts to reach an area at the edge of the circle without being tagged by the opponents.

===Surr===

Surr is played by two teams of at least four players, in a field divided by two perpendicular &quot;lines of defense&quot; (lanes) into four quadrants. The attacking team gathers in one quadrant, and aims to advance around the other three quadrants without having all of its players tagged out by the defensive team&#x27;s players, who must remain within the lines of defense.

==Variants requiring equipment==

Some variants of tag use equipment such as balls, paintball guns, or even flashlights to replace tagging by hand.

===Blind man&#x27;s bluff===
Blind man&#x27;s bluff, also known as Mr. Blind Man or Grounders, is a version of tag in which one player, designated as &quot;it&quot;, is blindfolded and attempts to tag the other players, while the other players try to avoid them.

=== Capture the flag ===

The field is divided into two halves, one for each team, and the goal of each team is to have its players go into enemy territory, grab the &quot;flag&quot; located in the back of their territory, and then make it back to friendly territory without being tagged.

===Computer tag===
Research students developed a version of tag played using handheld WiFi-enabled computers with GPS.

===Flashlight tag===
Flashlight tag, also called &quot;Army tag&quot;, &quot;Spotlight&quot;, and &quot;German Spotlight&quot;, is played at night. Rather than physically tagging, the &quot;it&quot; player tags by shining a flashlight beam on other players.

===Fox and geese===
A traditional type of line tag, sometimes played in snow, is Fox and geese. The fox starts at the centre of a spoked wheel, and the geese flee from the fox along the spokes and around the wheel. Geese that are tagged become foxes. The intersections of the spokes with the wheel are safe zones.

===Kick the can===

One person is &quot;it&quot; and a can is placed in an open space. The other players run off and hide, then &quot;it&quot; tries to find and tag each of them. Tagged players are sent to jail. Any player who has not been caught can kick the can, setting the other players free from jail. The player who is &quot;it&quot; must replace the can on its designated spot before they can resume chasing and tagging other players.

===Laser tag===
Laser tag is similar to flashlight tag, but using special equipment to avoid the inevitable arguments that arise about whether one was actually tagged. Players carry guns that emit beams of light and wear electronic equipment that can detect the beams and register being hit. The equipment often has built-in scoring systems and various penalties for taking hits. Pay-per-game laser tag facilities are common in North America.

===Marco Polo===
An aquatic American variant of blind man&#x27;s bluff, most commonly played in a swimming pool, although it may also be played while swimming in shallow natural bodies of water (typically the areas near the shores of oceans, seas, and lakes). The players may be swimming, treading water, or walking on the bottom of the pool or body of water. The person designated &quot;it&quot; is required to close their eyes, and shouts &quot;Marco!&quot; at regular intervals; the other players must shout &quot;Polo!&quot; in response. &quot;It&quot; must use sound localization to find one of the other players and tag them. The tagged player then generally becomes &quot;it,&quot; and the process repeats. In some variants, if any of the players who are not &quot;it&quot; climb out of the water to ensure not being caught (depending on the variant, this may be cheating) and the player designated &quot;it&quot; suspects this, they are to shout &quot;Fish out of water!&quot; and can open their eyes briefly to confirm this. If their suspicions are correct, then the culprit must become &quot;it&quot; as the game starts over.

===Muckle===
Muckle (sometimes called &quot;muckle the man with the ball&quot;, &quot;kill-the-guy-with-the-ball&quot;, &quot;smear the queer&quot;, &quot;kill the carrier&quot;, among other names) is the reverse of regular tag; all the other players chase &quot;it&quot;. This player is denoted by carrying a ball (usually a gridiron football). When they are caught, they are tackled, or &quot;muckled&quot;. Whoever retrieves the ball first or whoever attacks the one who is it then becomes it. Sometimes the last player arriving to tackle the former ball carrier is the next person to be it; in other variations the player with the ball throws the ball up in the air, where it is caught by another player who becomes it.

=== Nalugu Rallu Aata ===

In Nalugu Rallu Aata (Four-stones game), four players stand in four quadrants of a square, with &quot;it&quot; restricted to moving in the borders between the quadrants. There are four stones in the middle of the square, and the objective is for each player on the team of four to get a stone and then return to their own quadrant without being tagged.

===Paintball===
Paintball is a sport in which players use compressed air guns (called paintball markers) to tag other players with paint-filled pellets. Games are usually played on commercial fields with a strict set of safety and gameplay rules.

===Sock tag===
A tube sock is filled with a small amount of flour in the toe of the sock; the sock is then gripped by the leg hole and wielded as a flail. Striking a player with any part of the sock counts as a tag. When the sock strikes the player, the impact releases enough flour to leave a mark which serves as proof that the player was tagged.

=== Steal the bacon ===

In Steal the bacon (also known as Dog and the Bone or Rumal Jhapatta in India, or steal the flingsock/handkerchief), there are two teams on opposite ends of the field, with an object placed in the center of the field. Once play begins, one player from each team attempts to grab the object and then run back to their own team&#x27;s end of the field to score a point. If a player is holding the object and is tagged by an opponent, then they fail and the other team scores a point.

=== Tree-climbing monkey ===
There are several variations of and games related to &quot;Tree climbing monkey&quot; (such as Surparambya, Marakothi and Dand parhangrha). A team of several players attempt to climb up trees, while &quot;it&quot; tries to tag all of them. There is a stick in a circle on the ground, and &quot;it&quot; has to ensure none of the opponents touch that stick. In some similar games, such as Siya Satkana, there is no tree-climbing component to the game.

=== Tumbang preso ===

The player who is &quot;it&quot; guards a can placed on the ground, while one of the other players tries to throw their slipper at the can to knock it over. After throwing, players must recover their slippers and then return to the throwing area without being tagged. Before &quot;it&quot; can tag the players, &quot;it&quot; must first put the can back upright and in its original position.

==Team tag sports==

=== South Asian variations of tag ===
In South Asia, several sports are variants of tag, played at the team level, sometimes internationally.

==== Kabaddi ====
In , raiders cross a dividing line to try to tag defenders, while continuously chanting &quot;kabbadi&quot; on one breath while over the line, and then attempt to make it back over the line without being stopped (tackled) by the defenders. It is included in the Asian Games and even has a world championship, being played throughout India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Iran, as well as by the South Asian diaspora in Canada, Great Britain, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. It was also demonstrated in 1936 Berlin Olympics.

==== Kho kho ====

 involves an attacker trying to tag three defenders in a rectangular court. The attacker&#x27;s eight teammates sit in a central lane which divides the court into two halves, and which connects two poles at either end of the court. The attacker can not cross the central lane, and can not change direction once they start running towards either pole. The attacker has the option of switching roles with a teammate by touching their back, and can also run around either pole to enter the other half of the court. Kho kho&#x27;s first major professional franchise competition was the 2022 season of Ultimate Kho Kho.

==== Atya patya ====

Atya patya is played on a rectangular court, which is split into two halves by a central lane or &quot;trench&quot;, and which is further subdivided by nine trenches which are perpendicular to the central trench. The game is played in four 7-minute innings (turns), with teams alternating offense and defense in each inning. The goal of the attacking team is to have their players cross as many trenches as possible without being eliminated by a touch from any of the nine defensive players, each of whom stands in one of the trenches.

==== Langdi ====

Langdi is played in a small rectangular court, with the teams each having two 9-minute turns on offense and defense. The offensive team has one player in the court, while the defensive team sends in a batch of three players at a time. The offensive player is restricted to hopping around on one foot, and aims to tag as many defenders as possible.

=== World Chase Tag ===
World Chase Tag (WCT) is played between two teams of six players over 16 rounds of gameplay. The playing court is a -square with various objects and obstacles placed within it. Parkour is a major component of how the players navigate the obstacles in the court. In each round, one player from the offensive team (the chaser) tries to tag a player from the defending team (the evader) within 20 seconds. The evader scores a point if they successfully avoid being tagged during the round.

=== Tag rugby ===

Tag or flag rugby is a non-contact variation in which each player wears a belt that has two velcro tags attached to it, or shorts with velcro patches. The mode of play is also similar to rugby league with attacking players attempting to dodge, evade and pass a rugby ball while defenders attempt to prevent them scoring by tagging – pulling a velcro attached tag from the ball carrier. Flag football has similar gameplay, and is a non-contact variation of American football, a game related to rugby. However, the &quot;tag&quot; in &quot;tag rugby&quot; is derived from the &quot;tags&quot; that the players wear and the children&#x27;s game of tag more closely resembles touch rugby whereby a touch replaces a tackle.

== Games involving tagging ==

Some sports involve tagging as a minor, but crucial component of gameplay.

=== Baseball ===
In the bat-and-ball game of baseball, the offensive team&#x27;s players try to score by advancing around four bases without being put out (eliminated) by players on the defensive team. One way for a defender to put out an offensive player is to tag the offensive player (when they are not touching any of the bases) while holding the baseball.

The same mechanic is present in several variations of baseball, such as softball and Baseball5.

<text>The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA/; Macedonian, Montenegrin and ; Croatian and ; , JLA), also called the Yugoslav National Army, was the military of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its antecedents from 1945 to 1992.

==Origins==

The origins of the JNA started during the Yugoslav Partisans of World War II. As a predecessor of the JNA, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (NOVJ) was formed as a part of the anti-fascist People&#x27;s Liberation War of Yugoslavia in the Bosnian town of Rudo on 22 December 1941. After the Yugoslav Partisans liberated the country from the Axis Powers, that date was officially celebrated as the &quot;Day of the Army&quot; in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia).

In March 1945, the NOVJ was renamed the &quot;Yugoslav Army&quot; (&quot;Jugoslavenska/Jugoslovenska Armija&quot;) and, on its 10th anniversary, on 22 December 1951, &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;Narodna&quot;) was added.

The support the Soviets had within JNA ranks during the Informbiro period, after 1948, is contested. Low-end estimates indicate that 10–15% of the army&#x27;s personnel favoured the Soviet position. Yugoslav sources estimate the number of military members arrested ranged from 4,153 officers and soldiers (estimated by Radonjić), to 7,000 imprisoned officers estimated by Milovan Đilas. The purge included 22 officers in the presidential guard regiment reporting directly to Tito, including Momčilo Đurić, wartime commander of the Yugoslav Partisan Supreme Headquarters escort battalion. During this period of Soviet blockade, the Yugoslav Army&#x27;s development stagnated.

Forty-nine Yugoslav Army graduates of the General Staff Academy, the Frunze Academy, and other Soviet military academies were deemed potential Soviet supporters. Many of those attending such academies in the USSR at the time of the Tito–Stalin split never returned to Yugoslavia.

The split particularly affected the Air Force. Almost all Air Force officers had Soviet training, and some of them fled Yugoslavia in Air Force planes. The defectors included Major General Pero Popivoda, who was the head of the Air Force operational service. The Batajnica, Zemun, and Pančevo airbases near Belgrade saw several attacks by groups of saboteurs. The Zemun airbase commander and his deputy fled to Romania.

Between 1948 and 1955, the United States gave Yugoslavia US$600 million in direct military grants and an equal amount in economic aid, enabling Yugoslavia to devote more of its domestic resources to defence. After two visits to the United States by Colonel General Koča Popović and Colonel General Milo Kilibarda in May–June and August 1951, respectively, U.S. weaponry began arriving by late 1951. By 1952 the Armed Forces had grown to 500,000 troops, and defence expenditures consumed 22 percent of the gross national product. A Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) of 30 officers commanded by Brigadier General John W. Harmony was established by the United States in Belgrade in 1951. It operated for ten years, disbursing military grants and arranging another US$1 billion in arms sales on favorable terms. Among weapons transferred were 599 M-4A3 tanks, 319 M-47 tanks, 715 M-7, M-18, and M-36 self-propelled guns, 565 M-3A1 and M-8 armored cars, and a total of total of 760 105mm, 155mm, and 203mm artillery pieces. The artillery pieces delivered were used to reequip artillery units within Yugoslavia&#x27;s eight divisions.

==Task and command structure==

Under the constitution and laws of SFR Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army was a part of the armed forces with the Territorial Defense as the joint armed forces of all working people and citizens of Yugoslavia. The main task of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army was to protect the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and social organization of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Though the Presidency of Yugoslavia was the supreme commander of the armed forces and in command of Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, some duties from the presidency could be given to the Secretary of Defence. The Secretary of Defence was the officer with the highest military rank that could command the armed forces, including the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and Territorial Defense. The President of Yugoslavia had the power to promote members of the military to the highest military ranks such as general or admiral, and to relieve duty of the highest military officers. The Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, in the case that the Secretary of Defense was prevented or absent to fulfill his function, was formally his deputy who could take command of the armed forces. In 1987, under decree of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, the General Staff of the JNA was renamed to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia, thus effectively giving command of JNA and the TO to one military body in order to more efficiently command the armed forces in case of war, according to the law of &quot;All-people&#x27;s defense&quot; from 1982.

==Organization==
===Structure and organization in late 1980s and at beginning of 1990s===

In the mid-1980s, plans were made under a formal top-secret strategic and operational plan named &quot;Jedinstvo&quot; for a structural change from republic armies and divisions to military districts and brigades to allow for easier federal consolidation of the republics&#x27; territorial armies, particularly in the case of a crisis. Because of internal and external security changes during that time, &quot;Jedinstvo&quot; was later modeled in three parts: &quot;Jedinstvo 1&quot;, &quot;Jedinstvo 2&quot;, and &quot;Jedinstvo 3&quot;, starting from 1987 (with a planned completion date of 1995) for the JNA to start major reform.

The first part of JNA major overhaul under &quot;Jedinstvo 1&quot; had its basic force structure nearly completed in 1989. Manpower was planned to be reduced to about 1 million in wartime, while in peacetime it would be 299,057 personnel including officers, soldiers and the civilian workforce, including civil service. Equipment purchase was not realized in full.

The JNA&#x27;s organization and structure after &quot;Jedinstvo 1&quot; consisted of the Ground Forces, Air Force and Navy. Under reforms through the &quot;Jedinstvo&quot; plan it was planned to reorganize the army&#x27;s structure into four major army areas called &quot;Vojna Oblast&quot; under command of the Federal Secretariat of People&#x27;s Defence (SSNO) – &quot;Vojna oblast&quot; or military regions were further divided into corps, brigades, garrisons and smaller districts and sectors that were responsible for administrative tasks such as draft registration, mobilization, and construction and maintenance of military facilities. The regions were:

*The first military region with headquarters in Belgrade (responsible for eastern Croatia, northern and central parts of Serbia and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina)
*The second military region with headquarters in Zagreb (Slovenia and northern Croatia)
*The third military region with headquarters in Skopje (Macedonia, Southern Serbia and Montenegro)
*The military-naval region &quot;Vojnopomorska Oblast&quot; with its headquarters in Split. Military-Naval Region included parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro – almost all Yugoslavia coastline. It had subdivisions on three sectors including flotilla and one corps.

Directly under SSNO were the Guard&#x27;s motorized brigade, school centers, three SIGNAL regiments, a light anti-aircraft artillery regiment, and a few independent battalions and divisions.

In the &quot;Jedinstvo 1&quot; reforms, JNA eliminated most of its old divisional infantry organization and established the brigade and corps structure with some independent units under direct command of SSNO. Territorial defense was also changed and laws and the constitution were amended to address those changes. The Ground Forces &quot;converted ten of twelve infantry divisions into twenty-nine tank, mechanized and mountain infantry brigades with integral artillery, air defense and anti-tank regiments under corps structure. One airborne brigade was organized before 1990. The shift to brigade-level organization provided greater operational flexibility, maneuverability, and tactical initiative and reduced the possibility that large army units would be destroyed in set piece engagements with an aggressor. The change created many senior field command positions that would develop relatively young and talented officers.&quot; In 1989, five independent divisions under general staff command and 25 partisan (reserve) divisions under corps command were formed including many other battalions, regiments and batteries under different commands.

The 1989 plan &quot;Jedinstvo 2&quot; commenced and border battalions were transferred under corps command including some divisions that have remained before under others commands. Brigades got some artillery and antiaircraft batteries under their direct command that helped them to gain independence in wartime from higher levels. Defense of all major cities was previously planned with separate units but under &quot;Jedinstvo 2&quot; only Belgrade and Zagreb retained separated units for defense of their cities.

There were usually three classes of brigades, regiments and battalions:
* A. class
* B. class
* R. class

A. class brigades and battalions were more than 60 to up to 100% manned, and B. class units had 15–60% manpower. R. class units were reserved with about 15–20% and was manned mostly in their logistic units and commands. Battalions with A. class status were 100% manned and equipped. A. class brigades had a brigade HQ and 4 battalions and B class brigade had 2–3 battalions with HQ.

The &quot;Jedinstvo 3&quot; plan started in 1990. To the military leadership of the JNA, it was obvious that USSR was moving to defend its internal borders and the only global superpower left was the USA. It was then agreed in JNA that potential for aggression from the Warsaw Pact had diminished but potential aggression from NATO had increased. The new plan &quot;Jedinstvo 3&quot; included changes to organize better defenses from new perceived external threats. The plan required the building of smaller but more modernized forces with highly mobile units. Corps closer to the border would have two A. class brigades including an artillery regiment of A. class, an anti-armor regiment of B. class and an engineering battalion of A class. Corps deeper inside country would have one brigade of A. or B. class.

Under &quot;Jedinstvo 3&quot; every corps in the Air Force should have one support aviation brigade, one fighter wing, one Air Surveillance, Early Warning and Guidance regiment, 1–2 rocket brigades or regiments and rest up to possibilities to equip.

Under &quot;Jedinstvo 2&quot;, the JNA on 1 January 1990 had:
* 5 divisions – 2 R. and 3 B. class
* 23 partisans divisions of R. class
* 72 partisans brigade of R. class
* 20 infantry brigades – 2 A., 10 B. and 8 R. class
* 17 infantry regiments – 5 B. 12. R. class
* 7 hill brigades – 3 B. 4 R. class
* 1 mountain brigade B. class
* 32 motorized brigades – 4 A., 21 B. and 7. R. class
* 2 marines infantries brigades B. class
* 1 Guards motorized brigade A. class
* 6 Armor brigades of B. class
* 11 Guards Mechanized brigades – 7. A. class, 3. B. class and 1 R. class
* 1 artillery rocket brigade B. class
* 6 mixed artillery brigades B. class
* 5 mixed anti-armor artillery brigades B. class
and many others, including 19 military police battalions and river flotilla giving in total 28 divisions, 307 brigades and regiments and 137 independent battalions/divisions.

Under &quot;Jedinstvo 3&quot; until 1995, the structure of the JNA was:
* 1 Guards Mechanized division in A. class
* 18 Partisans divisions of R. class
* 7. Motorized brigades of R.class
* 39 motorized brigades – 7 A. class 
* 17 mechanized brigades – 15 A. and 2 R. class

There were other units that had smaller but more modern and mobile forces with more mobile A class units with a total of 19 divisions, 234. brigades and 104 independent battalions/regiments in 1995. Total manpower at the end of 1995 was about 222.151 in peace and 834.891 in war.

Internal changes in Yugoslavia prevented the total realization of the &quot;Jedinstvo 3&quot; plan. While many changes under it were done during 1990, not all were finished completely. While most commands and units were formed and manned, equipping was not finished according to plan because of dissolution of Yugoslavia and stopping of deliveries from most of domestic factories to units of JNA. As part of the armed forces, there was also the Territorial Defense, based on each republic&#x27;s territory that formed Yugoslavia that would fall under command of JNA during wartime.

===Ground Forces===
The Ground Forces had the greatest number of personnel. In 1991 there were about 140,000 active-duty soldiers (including 90,000 conscripts), and over a million trained reservists that could be mobilized in wartime. Each of the Yugoslav constituent six republics had its own Territorial Defence forces which were similar to the US national guard and were subordinate to supreme command as an integral part of the defence system in wartime. The territorial defence (reserve force) was made up of former conscripts; they were occasionally called up for war exercises.

In accordance with the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution the Land Forces were divided into six armies allocated to the five republics. The ground forces were organised into infantry, armour, artillery, and air defence, as well as signal, engineering and chemical defence corps.

===Air Force===
The Yugoslav Air Force had about 32,000 personnel including 4,000 conscripts, and operated over 400 aircraft and 200 helicopters. It was responsible for transport, reconnaissance and rotary-wing aircraft as well as the national air defence system. The primary air force missions were to contest enemy efforts to establish air supremacy over Yugoslavia and to support the defensive operations of the ground forces and navy. Most aircraft were produced in Yugoslavia. Missiles were produced domestically and supplied by the Soviet Union.

The Yugoslav Air Force had twelve squadrons of domestically produced ground attack fighters. The ground attack squadrons provided close air support to ground force operations. They were equipped with 165 new Soko J-22 Orao, Super Galeb and J-21 Jastreb, and older Soko J-20 Kraguj fighters. Many ground attack fighters were armed with AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missiles purchased from the United States. Others were armed with Soviet Kh-23 and Kh-28 missiles. The air force also had about ninety armed Mi-8 helicopter gunships to provide added mobility and fire support for small ground units. A large number of reconnaissance aircraft were available to support ground forces operations. Four squadrons of seventy Galeb, Jastreb, and Orao-1 fighters were configured for reconnaissance missions.

The Yugoslav Air Force had nine squadrons of 130 Soviet-made MiG-21 interceptors for air defence. First produced in the late 1950s, the MiG-21 design was largely obsolete in 1990 and represented a potential weakness in Yugoslavia&#x27;s air defence. However, the bulk of the MiG-21 fleet consisted mainly of the &quot;bis&quot; variant, the latest production MiG-21 model, and was armed with the Soviet Vympel K-13 (NATO reporting name: AA-2 &quot;Atoll&quot;) missile, air-to-air missiles and some Molniya R-60 (NATO reporting name: AA-8 &quot;Aphid&quot;) missiles as well as twin 23 mm cannons. By 1989, Yugoslavia started developing a new domestic multirole fighter plane called Novi Avion, which was supposed to replace the MiG-21 and J-21 Jastreb fleets entirely. The design of the new aircraft was influenced by the Mirage 2000 and Dassault Rafale fighter types and it was to enter service by the early 2000s. As an interim solution, a modernization package was planned for the MiG-21 and it is speculated that India&#x27;s MiG-21 Bison upgrade was actually intended for Yugoslav aircraft. In 1987, Yugoslavia acquired 16 MiG-29s.

Although not officially known at the time, Yugoslavia was rumoured to have been interested in the purchase of Su-25 attack-aircraft and Mi-24 gunships. Instead of developing its own fighter plane, the Novi Avion, the country made a request to licence-build the F-20, but due to unstable relations with the US, the request was rejected. By the late 1980s, the licensed production of Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopters was also planned, but due to the dissolution of the country, it was not continued. 

One of the structures operated by the Yugoslav Air Force was the underground Željava Air Base near the town of Bihać in northwest Bosnia and Herzegovina. The structure was made to withstand a nuclear explosion and was destroyed by the JNA in 1992 to prevent its capture. Željava was home to the 117th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which was composed of the 124th and 125th Fighter Squadrons, equipped with MiG-21Bis fighters, and the 352nd Reconnaissance Squadron, equipped with MiG-21R aircraft.

The Air and Air Defence Forces were headquartered at Zemun and had fighter and bomber aircraft, helicopters, and air defence artillery units at air bases throughout the former Yugoslavia: Batajnica Air Base (Belgrade), Niš Constantine the Great Airport, Slatina Air Base (Priština), Golubovci Airbase (Titograd), Skopski Petrovec, Sarajevo, Mostar, Željava Air Base (Bihać), Pleso (Zagreb), Split Airport, Pula, Zemunik (Zadar), Cerklje ob Krki and many other smaller air bases.

===Navy===
Minor surface combatants operated by the Yugoslav Navy included nearly eighty frigates, corvettes, submarines, minesweepers, and missile, torpedo, and patrol boats in the Adriatic Fleet. The entire coast of Yugoslavia was part of the naval region headquartered at Split, Croatia.

The Partisans had operated many small boats in raids harassing Italian convoys in the Adriatic Sea during World War II. After the war, the navy operated numerous German and Italian submarines, destroyers, minesweepers, and tank-landing craft captured during the war or received as war reparations. The United States provided eight torpedo boats in the late 1940s, but most of them were soon obsolete. The navy was upgraded in the 1960s when it acquired ten Osa-I-class missile boats and four s from the Soviet Union. The Soviets granted a license to build eleven additional Shershen units in Yugoslav shipyards developed for this purpose.

In 1980 and 1982, the Yugoslav navy took the delivery of two Soviet s. In 1988 it completed two additional units under license. The Koni frigates were armed with four Soviet P-15 Termit surface-to-surface missile launchers, twin 9K33 Osa (NATO reporting name: SA-8 &quot;Gecko&quot;) surface-to-air missiles, and anti-submarine rocket launchers.

The Yugoslav navy developed its own submarine-building capability during the 1960s. In 1990, the main combat units of the submarine service were three s armed with 533 mm torpedoes. Two smaller s entered service in the late 1970s. Two &quot;Sutjeska&quot;-class submarines had been relegated mainly to training missions by 1990. At that time the navy had apparently shifted to construction of versatile midget submarines. Four Una-class midgets and four Mala-class swimmer delivery vehicles were in service in the late 1980s. They were built for use by underwater demolition teams and special forces. The Una-class boats carried five crewmen, eight combat swimmers, four Mala vehicles, and limpet mines. The Mala vehicles carried two swimmers and of mines.

The Yugoslav navy operated ten Osa-class missile boats and six missile boats. The Osa I boats were armed with four P-15 Termit surface-to-surface missile launchers. In 1990, ten domestic &quot;Kobra&quot; missile boats were scheduled to begin replacing the Osa I class. The &quot;Kobra&quot; class was to be armed with eight Swedish RBS-15 anti-ship missiles, and fifteen of them were ordered in late 1989. Armed with two P-15 Termit launchers, the &quot;Končar&quot;-class boats were modeled after the , and there were plans to upgrade them with Swedish-built missiles. Two &quot;Kobra&quot; missile boats were built by Croatia as the and both are still in service. The navy&#x27;s fifteen Topčider-class torpedo boats included four former Soviet Shershen class and eleven Yugoslav built units.

The Yugoslav navy&#x27;s mine warfare and countermeasures capabilities were considered adequate in 1990. It operated four &quot;Vukov Klanac&quot;-class coastal minesweepers built on a French design, four British s, and six 117-class inshore minesweepers built in domestic shipyards. Larger numbers of older and less capable minesweepers were mainly used in riverine operations. Other older units were used as dedicated minelayers. The navy used amphibious landing craft in support of army operations in the area of the Danube, Sava, and Drava rivers. They included both tank and assault landing craft. In 1990, there were four 501-class, ten 211-class, and twenty-five 601-class landing craft in service. Most of them were also capable of laying mines in rivers and coastal areas.

The Yugoslav Navy had 10,000 sailors (including 4,400 conscripts and 900 marines). They were essentially a coastal defence force with the mission of preventing enemy amphibious landings along the country&#x27;s rugged 4,000-kilometer shoreline and coastal islands, and contesting enemy blockade or control of the strategic Strait of Otranto. The entire coast of Yugoslavia was part of the naval region headquartered at Split. The naval region was divided into three smaller naval districts and a riverine flotilla with major naval bases located at Split, Šibenik, Pula, Ploče and Kotor on the Adriatic Sea, and Novi Sad on the River Danube. The strategic islands of Vis and Lastovo were heavily fortified and unauthorised entry was prohibited. The fleet was organized into missile, torpedo, and patrol boat brigades, a submarine division, and minesweeper flotillas. The naval order of battle included four frigates, three corvettes, five patrol submarines, fifty-eight missile, torpedo, and patrol boats, and twenty-eight minesweepers. One antisubmarine warfare helicopter squadron was based at Split on the Adriatic coast. It employed Soviet Ka-25, Ka-28, and Mi-14 helicopters, and domestic Partisan helicopters. Some air force fighter and reconnaissance squadrons supported naval operations.

===Military education and composition===
The Yugoslav Constitution of 1974 principally tried to have the most proportional representation of Yugoslavia&#x27;s republics and autonomous provinces in the high army ranks. It is defined in article 242 of the constitution, which says that, &quot;Regarding the composition of staff and the employment in the high command and leadership functions in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army the principle is applied of as proportional representation as possible of republics and autonomous provinces&quot;.

Serbs, Montenegrins, and Yugoslavs were by some opinions over-represented in the officer corps, but that was still in accordance with cited constitution. JNA&#x27;s high-ranking positions in 1980 was dominated by ethnic Serbs, including the chief of the armed forces, minister of defense and secretary of the LCY in the JNA. Nobody was preventing anyone in Yugoslavia to become JNA officer in accordance to the law &quot;Zakon o vojnim školama i naučnoistraživačkim ustanovama Jugoslovenske narodne armije&quot; that had no exclusions clause. Proportional presentations was to be between republics and autonomous provinces according to cited part of constitution and not between nations. Military schools in Yugoslavia in accordance with law about military schools were built in all Yugoslavia Republics. In Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, military schools possessed 38,391 annual capacity or 50.54% of the total compared to Serbia, which had 30,843 capacity for educating military personnel that constituted about 40.62% of total capacity and rest was among other republics.

===Anniversaries and rewards===

22 December was established as the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army Day. On that day all units and organizations within JNA including other Yugoslavia states bodies celebrated the day the JNA was founded. Prestigious awards were given on that day: they were called &quot;dvadesetdrugi decembar&quot;. Rewards were given to anyone who had contributed to the defence of Yugoslavia in some way including military, scientific, economic or another contribution. Winners of such awards were highly praised in media and among the populace. Every ten years, special medals were awarded on 22 December. It was last promoted by the JNA general, the winner of the 22 December reward and JNA silver star medal. Major general Ener Taso died on 12 December 2018.

==Industry==

The arms industry was dominant in the Yugoslav economy. With annual exports of $3 billion, it was twice as large as the second largest industry, tourism.

Several companies in Yugoslavia produced airplanes and combat aircraft, most notably SOKO of Mostar, with the Soko J-22 Orao being its best known product. There was also Zastava Arms for firearms and artillery. Another important manufacturer was Utva in Serbia. The Yugoslav military–industrial complex produced tanks (most notably, the M-84), armored vehicles (BOV APC, BVP M-80), various artillery pieces (mortars, multiple rocket launchers, howitzers), anti-aircraft weapons, as well as various types of infantry weapons and other equipment.

==Infrastructure==
JNA had modern infrastructure with many air bases including underground shelters and command and control centers in many locations including several mountains. The biggest and best known installation was the Željava Air Base, also known as the Bihać Underground Integrated Radar Control and Surveillance Centre and Air Base, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

== Oath ==
The oath of the JNA was:
==Doctrine==
The JNA adopted the concept of total defence (as did a number of other small European and neutral countries). Yugoslavia based its defence doctrine upon the total war concept of &quot;Total People&#x27;s Defence&quot; (sh. Opštenarodna odbrana / Općenarodna obrana) which drew upon Yugoslavia&#x27;s successful partisan history during the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Liberation War during the Second World War. &quot;TND prepared the entire population to contest the occupation of the country and finally to liberate it. The Territorial Defence Forces would mobilize the population for this purpose. The combat readiness of the TDF meant that the steps of organization and training could be bypassed after the start of hostilities. The TDF would supplement the YPA, giving it greater defensive depth and an armed local population ready to support combat actions.&quot; The entire Yugoslav population was to be engaged in armed resistance, armaments production, and civil defence under this concept. It was believed by the Yugoslav planners to be the best method by which a smaller nation could properly defend itself against a much stronger invader, specifically, NATO or the Warsaw Pact.

===Dissolution===

In January 1990, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was effectively dissolved as a national organization following its 14th Congress where the Serbian and Slovene delegations engaged in a public confrontation. The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army was left without an ideological support mechanism. 99% of the officers of the Army were members of the communist party.

The dissolution of Yugoslavia began when independent, non-communist governments were established in the Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. In 1990, the Socialist Republic of Slovenia changed its name to Republic of Slovenia and ceased contributing funds to the federal government for a sustained military budget. Soon afterward the Slovene government began a re-organization of its territorial defense, bringing the former constituent republic&#x27;s Territorial Defense reserve forces under its control as the Slovenian Territorial Defence.

In March 1991, Yugoslav defense minister General Veljko Kadijević organized a meeting at the military complex in Topčider, Belgrade. Present at this meeting were all 6 presidents of the Yugoslav republics, presidents of the autonomous republics, the Yugoslav president and all top military officers. Kadijević claimed that there were numerous paramilitary organizations in Yugoslavia sponsored by foreign and domestic enemies of the state. He stated that if federal and republic officials &quot;failed to ensure peace, the Yugoslav armed forces could efficiently do so themselves.&quot; He also stated that the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army was dealing with Ustaše, Chetniks, and other &quot;enemies of socialism&quot; stemming from World War II conflicts. Kadijević proposed a declaration of martial law. A subsequent vote was held on Kadijević&#x27;s recommendation of martial law, and the suggestion was vetoed.

In April 1991, the government of Croatia formed the Croatian National Guard (ZNG), which the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army considered to be a paramilitary organization. On 25 June 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence from Yugoslavia. On the same day, Slovenian Territorial Defence units captured Yugoslav control posts on the borders with Italy, Hungary and Austria. Slovene forces also established border control posts on their border with Croatia.
As a result of these actions, on 27 June 1991 the JNA attacked Slovenia, with its top commanders citing the constitutional obligation to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces attacked the Slovene units on the border and in all other areas under Slovene control. The Slovenian Territorial Defence blockaded all ten Yugoslav bases in Slovenia and kept them under siege in the Ten-Day War which ended on 6 July 1991. Yugoslav forces had 44 killed and 146 wounded, with many Yugoslav officers being wounded or captured. After the Brioni Agreement was signed, the JNA agreed to withdraw from Slovenia by 10 October 1991, leaving large amounts of equipment behind.

On 27 June 1991, war in Croatia began. The JNA and the Serbians were on one side and Croatian military units on the other. On 14–15 September, Croatia launched the Battle of the Barracks, besieging over 20 Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army barracks and depots, leaving Yugoslav soldiers without food, water or electricity for weeks. Some Croatian citizens deserted from the JNA and began joining Croatian military forces. Senior Yugoslav officers also defected to Croatia, including Air Force Commander-in-Chief Colonel general Anton Tus. In August 1991, the Battle of Vukovar began. It was the biggest battle in Croatia before Operation Storm and Operation Flash. In the battle, 90% of the city was destroyed. The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army used fighter and attack aircraft, rocket launchers, a large number of tanks and other equipment.

Macedonia declared independence on 8 September 1991, but the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army did not militarily respond. In November, Vukovar was captured and 80% of Croatian forces were destroyed or captured. Many atrocities were committed in the city by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and local Serb guerrillas and regulars, including the Velepromet concentration camp, Vukovar massacre, etc.

In mid-October 1991, Yugoslav ground forces, supported by naval and air forces, attacked the city of Dubrovnik and the Konavle area where the Croats had strongholds, starting the Siege of Dubrovnik. By 6 December, Yugoslav forces had neutralized all Croat formations in the Konavle area, but Dubrovnik had not been captured. After these two operations, the JNA signed the Sarajevo Agreement with Croatia and began to withdraw. In January 1992, Veljko Kadijević resigned after the 1992 European Community Monitor Mission helicopter downing.

The JNA left Macedonia in March 1992. Around the same time, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence following a referendum and the Bosnian War started soon thereafter between the country&#x27;s Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. The JNA officially withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 1992. In January of 1992, Bosnian Serb state was declared. Later renamed Republika Srpska, it developed its own military as the JNA withdrew and handed over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops to the newly created Bosnian Serb army. On 20 May 1992 the JNA was formally dissolved, the remnants of which reformed into the military of the newly founded Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<doc id="536650" wikidata="Q5502090" url="?curid=536650" title="French cricket">
<text>French cricket is a form of cricket that creates a game similar to catch. The game can be played socially at picnics and parties or on parks and beaches. It is a form of cricket that can include children of varied ages.

 In India children often play this game with a plastic or rubber ball, it is called as &quot;Bat-Ball&quot; or &quot;Catch-Catch&quot;, and in some parts of Australia the game is referred to as &quot;toey&quot;, derived from the word &#x27;toe&#x27; (as feet are a target for dismissal, see below).

==Game play==
There is only one batter, and their objective is to not be dismissed by the other participants — who are fielders, or a bowler if they have possession of the ball — for as long as possible. The objective of the other participants is to dismiss the batter. There are only two methods of dismissal, being caught or being &quot;Leg Before Wicket&quot;, but as there are no stumps, this method of dismissal is effected by a bowled ball hitting the batter&#x27;s legs typically below the knees. Once the batter is dismissed, the other participant who took the catch or effected the LBW typically replaces them as batter, and the game-play begins again. 
There are many varieties of additional rules. The batter may be obliged to stay with their legs in the same place, facing the same way for the whole of their innings; they may remain in the same place but be permitted to change their stance if they effect a shot by hitting the ball; or, they may be able to freely move around after playing a shot. The batter may also score runs in some variations of the game.

==Rules==
The batsman stands stationary with the bat protecting their legs, their legs being the &quot;stumps&quot; of formal cricket. Whichever other player has the ball throws it at the batsman attempting to dismiss them by hitting their legs. If the batsman hits the ball, the other participants may also dismiss the batman by a catch.

===Players===
French cricket is most commonly played by children, or mixed groups of children and adults. Adults sometimes play the game as an event diversion during outdoor parties or on picnics. 
If the game is played more seriously, players take turns to bat and the player who batted for the most balls or the longest time is considered the winner.

===Equipment===
The type of equipment is not restricted to cricket equipment, but there are only two items used. The ball is typically a tennis ball, bowled underarm at the legs of another player holding a cricket bat, a tennis racquet, or some other object that can be used as like a cricket bat.
Albert Camus, in his book The First Man, describes (page 34) the game of &quot;Canette Vinga&quot; played with a cigar shaped bit of wood rather than a ball. The batter stands in a circle and the bowler has to get the pointed piece of wood to land in the circle, whilst the batter tries to hit it far away. Camus calls the game &quot;Poor man&#x27;s tennis&quot; (page 35) but it is much nearer to French Cricket.

===Batting===
The player holding the bat, the batsman, is required to block and defend their &quot;wicket&quot;, with the batsman&#x27;s legs taking the place of the stumps. The batsman is not allowed to move their legs, and in some variants, the batsman can only hit the ball in a direct upward or scooping-like motion.

===Fielding===
Any number of fielders can stand around the batsman, and any fielder can bowl at the batsman from any angle.

When played in India, normally players can stand front, left and right side but can not stand behind the batsman and bowler must bowl with a full toss to batsman and they should hit ball in the air but they should not hit the ball far from the fielders’ reach. 

===Rule varieties===
====Batting====
* Often, the batsman is only allowed to turn to face the next delivery if they hit the ball. If they miss and are not dismissed, they must attempt to play the next ball (which is bowled from where the ball ended up after the previous delivery) without being allowed to turn to face it. Sometimes additionally, if the batsman does not turn to face the ball before a fielder picks it up, they would have to turn their waist and face the fielder bowling in order to hit the ball. 
* In some variations, the batsman is not allowed to turn at all, and is declared out if their feet move. Restrictive rules like this also help to contain the ball in smaller areas such as backyards.
* In other variations, if the batsman has effected a shot, they can relocate as fast as they can run, until a fielder has the ball in their hands.
* In other variations, a batsman can score runs. Alternatively, when the batsman hits the ball, they can make &#x27;runs&#x27; by revolving the bat around themselves with both hands. A batsman can take these runs until the ball is in the hands of a fielder and they call &#x27;ready&#x27;.
* In other variations, a batsman cannot be out first ball. A batsman scores &#x27;runs&#x27; each time a ball is bowled at them or passed between fielders. And, if they should hit a rather lengthy shot, for a bonus of 10 &#x27;runs&#x27; they can offer the bowler a free bowl without being allowed to defend it.

====Fielding====
* In one variation, once the fielder has fielded the ball they cannot take any steps until they have bowled the ball or passed the ball to another fielder. Passes to fielders can be thrown overarm or sidearm but to get a batter out with a direct throw the fielder must throw the ball underarm. 
* Sometimes the batsman can be caught out &quot;one-hand one-bounce&quot;. When this rule is applied, the batsman will also be dismissed if the catcher takes the ball with one hand after it has bounced only once.

==Origin of the name==
Suggested possibilities include juxtaposition with the English origin of regular cricket. It seems likely that as the game is a lesser version of regular cricket that the name is intended to mock both the game and the French — just as a &quot;French cut&quot; in the sport of cricket is a poorly executed cut shot which almost gets a batsman out. The name may also have arisen from the similarity of the batting motion to the one used in croquet which while not a French game is sometimes assumed to be French because of its name.

<text>Jak and Daxter is an action-adventure platformer third-person shooter video game franchise created by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin and owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The series was originally developed by Naughty Dog with a number of installments being outsourced to Ready at Dawn and High Impact Games. The first game, &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;, released on December 4, 2001, was one of the earliest titles for the PlayStation 2, and the series collectively is regarded as a defining franchise for the console.

The games are story-based platformers that feature a mixture of action, racing and puzzle solving. The series is set in a fictional universe that incorporates science fantasy, steampunk, cyberpunk, and mystical elements, while centering on the eponymous characters as they try to uncover the secrets of their world, and unravel the mysteries left behind by an ancient race called the Precursors. The games are inspired by a combination of Eastern and Western culture, a decision made among the team members at Naughty Dog and related stakeholders while developing the first title.

The first three games in the series were re-released on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita as part of the remastered &quot;Jak and Daxter Collection&quot; that includes support for the PlayStation Network and the PlayStation Suite. The original three &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; games, along with &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot;, were released for the PlayStation 4 as &quot;Jak and Daxter Bundle&quot; in August 2017, alongside the release of &quot;&quot;. In December that year, &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;, &quot;Jak II&quot;, &quot;Jak 3&quot; and &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot; were also released for individual purchase. The first four games were later made available on PlayStation 5 through backward compatibility with the PlayStation 4. In 2024, the remaining two games, &quot;Daxter&quot; and &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier&quot;, were re-released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first time every game in the series was available on a single platform. The series has also produced various forms of extended media and merchandise, and has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.

==Games==
===Main installments===
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was first released in North America on December 4, 2001, for the PlayStation 2. After Daxter falls into a Dark Eco silo at the forbidden Misty Island, he is transformed from a human into an ottsel, a fictional hybrid of an otter and weasel. In a quest to return Daxter to human form, he and Jak set out to find the Dark Eco sage Gol Acheron. However, the duo find Acheron corrupted by Dark Eco, choosing to use the elusive Light Eco to defeat him and save the world at the cost of Daxter remaining in his ottsel form. A Flash game was published online in 2001 to promote &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;.

Jak II was first released in North America on October 14, 2003, for the PlayStation 2. Its narrative takes place directly after the events of &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;. Jak, Daxter, Samos, and Keira are thrust into the industrious Haven City after using the rift gate, with Jak being imprisoned by the Krimzon Guard upon his arrival in the city. Jak is subjected to experiments with Dark Eco and is subsequently capable of using Dark Eco powers. With the help of Daxter, Jak escapes the prison and is now in search of vengeance against the Krimzon Guard.

Jak 3 was first released in North America on November 9, 2004, for the PlayStation 2. After being blamed by the residents of Haven City for its destruction, Jak and Daxter are exiled to the Wasteland by Count Veger. Ashelin gives Jak a beacon in hopes that he&#x27;ll be tracked down, with Damas, the king of nearby Spargus, rescuing him. In exchange, Jak and Daxter must now prove their worth to Damas and the city or risk being banished and thrown back into the desert.

===Other games===
Jak X: Combat Racing was first released in North America on October 18, 2005, for the PlayStation 2. Its narrative takes place following the events of &quot;Jak 3&quot;, with Jak and his allies inadvertently being poisoned while attending the reading of Krew&#x27;s last will. Jak and his allies must partake and win the Kras City Grand Championship, a championship of the fictional sport of &quot;combat racing&quot;, in Krew&#x27;s name in order to obtain an antidote for the poison.

Daxter was first released in North America on March 14, 2006, for the PlayStation Portable. The game primarily focuses on Daxter, taking place during the two-year gap introduced in the opening of &quot;Jak II&quot;. Daxter is now employed as a pest exterminator by the Kridder Ridder company, in which he works to mitigate the incoming metal bug invasion. Alongside this work, Daxter is on a quest to find and free Jak from his imprisonment by the Krimzon Guard.

Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier was first released in North America on November 3, 2009, for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Its narrative takes place an undisclosed amount of time after the events of the original trilogy. When their world begins to run low on Eco, Jak, Daxter, and Keira travel to the Brink, the edge of the world, in search of ancient Precursor machinery that can reverse this decline of Eco.

===Collections and remasters===
Jak and Daxter Collection was first released in North America on February 7, 2012, for the PlayStation 3—the franchise&#x27;s first appearance on the platform. It is a remastered port of the original trilogy—&quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;, &quot;Jak II&quot;, and &quot;Jak 3&quot;. The games were ported by Mass Media Games and feature 720p graphics at 60 frames per second and trophies. Mass Media Games later ported the collection to the PlayStation Vita and it was released in June 2013—the franchise&#x27;s only appearance on this platform.

Jak and Daxter Bundle was first released in North America on December 7, 2017, for the PlayStation 4—the franchise&#x27;s first appearance on the platform. The bundle features emulations of &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;, &quot;Jak II&quot;, &quot;Jak 3&quot;, and &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot;, in addition to retaining trophy support. Prior to the release of the bundle, &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot; was released on the PlayStation 4 as a pre-order bonus for &quot;&quot;. Between 2019 and 2020, Limited Run Games released a limited amount of physical copies of both standard and collector&#x27;s editions of the games.

==Gameplay==
The series consists of four single-player-only games, and two that include multiplayer. The series is primarily a story-based platformer presented in the third-person perspective. The player can explore a multitude of different areas in an open world environment and can perform several melee attacks. A substance called Eco can also be manipulated to enhance the player&#x27;s abilities, with differently-colored Eco having different effects. Red Eco enhances the damage dealt and yields one impervious to damage from Dark Eco crates. Blue Eco allows the player to move faster, jump slightly higher, move slightly farther using attacks, attract Green Eco and Precursor orbs, and operate certain color coded machines. Green Eco is used to restore health, while Yellow Eco allows the player to shoot fire from the character&#x27;s hands, which can be done “from the hip,” or using a scope. A hover bike called a &quot;Zoomer&quot; and a large bird known as a &quot;Flut-Flut&quot; are also available for transportation and to gain access to hard-to-reach places. “Flut-Flut” also has the ability to attack. Power Cells and Precursor Orbs are required to advance the story in &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;, while completing story-related missions and collecting Precursor Orbs unlocks new locations and allows the player to unlock certain “Secrets” in all subsequent entries.

Shooting elements are briefly introduced in &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;, becoming fully implemented in &quot;Jak II&quot;. &quot;Jak II&quot; features customizable weapons and other varied forms of combat, expanding upon features present in &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;. For example, Jak has many different gun mods. Each one is a certain color, either Red, Blue, Yellow, or Dark. Red gun mods make the gun similar to a shotgun. Blue lets it fire as a machine gun. Yellow mods are for long-range shooting, and Dark mods are for utmost power. Daxter is also a playable character and features in several &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;-esque missions. Dark Eco powers also become available, which is countered by the introduction of Light Eco powers in &quot;Jak 3&quot;. Guns can be upgraded twice through accomplishing certain story missions, and several abilities to use in both Light and Dark Jak forms are unlocked as well. Driving becomes a core ingredient and is further expanded upon in &quot;Jak 3&quot;. In &quot;The Lost Frontier&quot; aerial combat is integrated into the series. Precursor orbs can be collected in each game to unlock cheats.

&quot;Jak X&quot; deviates from the series&#x27; more traditional style of gameplay, adapting into the racing genre, and is based on the driving mechanics developed for &quot;Jak 3&quot;. Several extras can be unlocked for &quot;Jak X&quot; and &quot;Daxter&quot; by linking up the save files from the two respective games, and several player skins can be unlocked if the player has save files from &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;, &quot;Jak II&quot;, &quot;Jak 3&quot; and Insomniac Games&#x27; &quot;&quot;.

With the exception of &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;, each installment offers &quot;Hero Mode&quot;, which allows a player to replay the game at a higher level of difficulty with all or most of their previous acquisitions. This mode, in addition to other bonus content, can be unlocked by finishing the game and purchasing said content in the secrets menu with Precursor Orbs.

==Development==
===Main series===
Naughty Dog began work on a new game shortly after the release of the sixth generation of consoles. Only two programmers were originally allocated to the project, as the rest of the department was still developing &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;. They began by building a new graphics engine that would be capable of rendering a seamlessly connected, open world environment. They then developed a fully articulated character to examine the engine&#x27;s efficiency, before presenting the idea to Sony Computer Entertainment following the completion of &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;. The aim of their new title was to break away from the linear approach taken in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series, with minimal story and character development, and individually loaded levels. In a behind-the-scenes special by &quot;Naughty Dog&quot; it was revealed that a new blend animation had been utilised for the game, allowing for a smoother frame rate and animation process. The engine for &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; was created from the ground up specifically for the game. Unusually for most games, Naughty Dog invented a new programming language, GOAL, which was only ever used for the &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; series.

&quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; was revealed at E3 in June 2001. The game had a budget of $14 million and a development cycle that lasted nearly three years. At that time, they managed to create a fully interactive world and conceived a narrative that would allow for more meaningful character development. The two central characters also went through a rigid design process that took inspiration from both manga and Disney animation. They had initially planned on introducing a third character who would evolve as the game progressed in a Tamogotchi-style fashion. However, this idea was scrapped as it led to several unnecessary complications. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was recorded at Mutato Muzika Studios, and was produced by Mark Mothersbaugh with Josh Mancell composing the score.

===Side games===
====PlayStation Portable====
Following the release of the PlayStation Portable, Naughty Dog took interest in developing a new &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; title for the system. Producer Sam Thompson helmed the production of the game, while Neil Druckmann was responsible for much of the design. The team ultimately produced a tech demo, and had plans to allow players the ability to &quot;create your own airships and cobble together all these things with these different stat bonuses and actually have meaningful engagements in the air&quot;. However, Evan Wells revealed that they were unable to sustain the game&#x27;s development alongside &quot;&quot; and made the decision to pass the project onto High Impact Games, ultimately being fleshed out as &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier&quot;. Following the lackluster success of the game, Thompson expressed the company&#x27;s disappointment with the execution of &quot;The Lost Frontier&quot;, commenting &quot;I&#x27;m not happy with that being Jak&#x27;s swan song. I think we could have done a lot better&quot;.

==Common elements==
===Setting===

&quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; is set in a fictional universe. The first game takes place in a world brimming with various natural environments that are encompassed by village settlements, and ancient Precursor ruins and elements can be found riddled throughout the landscape. An elemental substance called Eco is prominent throughout the game and is considered the world&#x27;s life source. Eco comes in several forms, Red Eco, Blue Eco, Yellow Eco, Green Eco, Light Eco and Dark Eco, each with different prospective effects. Subsequent entries/games are set in a future setting that has witnessed large advancements in both society and technology, mainly taking place in cities and other larger settlements and affecting both hand-to-hand combat and available weaponry. Beyond cities in subsequent games lies natural environments with many platforming segments, akin to the first game. Overall, there are many distinct and differing environments available to discover and explore. All three main titles take place in an open world with little to no load times - a goal emphasized heavily since the first game.

===Characters===
The &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; universe is populated primarily by a humanoid elfish species. Jak is the main protagonist of the series, and is playable in every game with the exception of &quot;Daxter&quot;. In &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot;, he accidentally turned Daxter from a human into an ottsel (a fictional hybrid of an otter and weasel) after accidentally bumping him into a reservoir of Dark Eco and sets out on a quest in attempts to undo the transformation. In &quot;Jak II&quot;, he is infused with Dark Eco due to experimentations performed by Baron Praxis, and in &quot;Jak 3&quot; he is blessed with Light Eco by the Precursors. Both Light and Dark Eco abilities are expanded upon during the course of the story in “Jak 3.” In &quot;Jak X&quot;, he is forced to race in the Kras City Grand Championship in order to save his life. He later travels to The Brink to investigate the Eco shortage that is ravaging his world in &quot;The Lost Frontier&quot;.

Daxter is Jak&#x27;s sidekick, and is often found getting into trouble. Daxter was once a human but fell into a pit of Dark Eco in the opening cutscene of the first game in the series, which mutated him into an ottsel. He rescues Jak at the beginning of &quot;Jak II&quot;, and becomes playable intermittently for the first time in the series. In &quot;Jak 3&quot; his role is expanded, and he gets a pair of pants as a reward for his efforts as an ongoing gag in the game. In &quot;Daxter&quot;, he details his adventures in the two-year time span before he managed to break Jak out of prison. In &quot;Jak X&quot;, he accompanies Jak and his friends to Kras City, and assists them as they compete in the Kras City Grand Championship. He later travels with Jak and Keira to The Brink in &quot;The Lost Frontier&quot;.

==Music==
Five &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; soundtracks have been commercially released and have featured several composers, including Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, Larry Hopkins, Billy Howerdel, and James Dooley. The compositions were inspired by world music, with Mancell commenting that he intended &quot;to create something other than an expected orchestral flavoured fantasy soundtrack. I ended up using a lot of non-Western instruments and traditional, Western orchestral instruments such as the French Horn and Cello. Additionally, I feel the Jak games have both an ancient and futuristic vibe about them — I wanted the music to evoke both qualities.&quot; The soundtracks for &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;, &quot;Jak II&quot;, &quot;Jak 3&quot;, and &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot; were all commercially released in 2019 by Limited Run Games as part of the Collector&#x27;s Edition of each respective game.

On November 2, 2009, &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on the iTunes Store by SIE.

==Critical reception==

With physical and digital copies combined, the &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; franchise has sold over 15 million games worldwide (as of April 2017). &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; received critical acclaim from several reviewers as compiled by review aggregator Metacritic, with the game having the highest score in the franchise at 90/100. &quot;Jak II&quot;, &quot;Jak 3&quot;, &quot;Daxter&quot;, and &quot;Jak and Daxter Collection&quot; (PS3) all received generally favorable reception, while &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot; only received mixed reception. &quot;The Lost Frontier&quot; also only had mixed reception and, not including the PlayStation Vita port of &quot;Jak and Daxter Collection&quot;, it has the lowest score in the series from Metacritic (71/100).

The series has received critical acclaim for its innovation in the platform genre. The series holds seven records in the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, 2008, with &quot;The Precursor Legacy&quot; holding a record for including the First Seamless 3D World in a Console Game. Jack DeVries of &quot;IGN&quot; referred to the series as &quot;the best action platformers of [that] generation,&quot; praising the &quot;huge worlds, memorable characters, action packed stories, and great gameplay&quot;. Jeffrey Matulef of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; stated that &quot;the &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; series may not be as solid a platformer as &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; and its gunplay isn&#x27;t as refined as &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&#x27;s&quot; – but in terms of ambition, invention and grandiosity, it remains leagues above its last-gen platforming brethren&quot;.

The series has also received praise for its diverse gameplay styles. Matt Helgeson of &quot;Game Informer&quot; noted that the &quot;series was driven by a restless sense of innovation,&quot; praising &quot;Naughty Dog&#x27;s work in this franchise [for creating] great characters, finely tuned gameplay, and a unceasing inventiveness&quot;. Helgeson also declared that the &quot;Jak&quot; games &quot;stand up as epic adventures&quot;. Matulef further stated that &quot;the &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; series remains a fascinating document of the evolution of the action adventure; its heroes are unstuck in time, without a genre to call home. No series has been so willing to switch gameplay styles with such reckless abandon, and &quot;The Jak and Daxter Trilogy&quot; represents a shining example of what happens when a capable developer takes a huge risk.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that the franchise&#x27;s &quot;tight execution and heavy action elements ensure that things never become dull,&quot; adding that the franchise &quot;manages to provide a rewarding gameplay experience that shouldn&#x27;t be missed&quot;.

==Merchandise==
Naughty Dog have released various forms of merchandise since the series&#x27; inception. These include strategy guides for each game, several forms of clothing and collectible figures. A limited edition Precursor orb was also released to celebrate the series&#x27; 10th anniversary.

==Future==
Evan Wells revealed that they had explored the idea of making a new game extensively before the development began on &quot;The Last of Us&quot; (2013). Creative director Neil Druckmann later unveiled several illustrations for the abandoned game at a conference for &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. He explained that they had planned on making a reboot of the series and had spent a long time exploring various concepts.

In response to an alleged concept art leak in 2016, Naughty Dog&#x27;s Director of Communication Arne Meyer stated that nothing was currently being worked on. Also, due to circumstances at Naughty Dog, Jak and Daxter has not yet been reconsidered, but is never off the table.

In 2019, Limited Run Games announced a commemorative mock case for the unreleased &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; reboot, which was released in June 2020. The mock case uses the title &quot;Jak IV&quot; and features concept art from the scrapped reboot that was revealed in Naughty Dog&#x27;s coffee table book, &quot;The Art of Naughty Dog&quot;.

In February 2022, a &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; film adaptation was rumored to be in development with Ruben Fleischer and Naughty Dog, although as of 2024, nothing has been confirmed.

<text>The Templeton Prize is an annual award granted to a living person, in the estimation of the judges, &quot;whose exemplary achievements advance Sir John Templeton&#x27;s philanthropic vision: harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind&#x27;s place and purpose within it.&quot; It was established, funded and administered by John Templeton starting in 1972. It is now co-funded by the John Templeton Foundation, Templeton Religion Trust, and Templeton World Charity Foundation, and administered by the John Templeton Foundation.

The prize was originally awarded to people working in the field of religion (Mother Teresa was the first winner), but in the 1980s the scope broadened to include people working at the intersection of science and religion. Until 2001, the name of the prize was &quot;Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion&quot;, and from 2002 to 2008 it was called the &quot;Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities&quot;. Hindus, Christians, Jews, Buddhists and Muslims have been on the panel of judges and have been recipients of the prize.

The monetary value of the prize is adjusted so that it exceeds that of the Nobel Prizes; Templeton felt, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, that &quot;spirituality was ignored&quot; in the Nobel Prizes. , it is £1.1 million. It was typically presented by Prince Philip, during his lifetime, in ceremonies held at Buckingham Palace.

The prize has been referred to as prestigious and coveted, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling it the most prestigious award in religion. Atheist scientists Richard Dawkins, Harry Kroto and Jerry Coyne have criticized the prize as &quot;blurring [religion&#x27;s] well-demarcated border with science&quot; and being awarded &quot;to scientists who are either religious themselves or say nice things about religion&quot;, a criticism rejected by 2011 laureate Martin Rees, who pointed to his own and other laureates&#x27; atheism and that their research in fields such as psychology, evolutionary biology, and economy can hardly be classified as the &quot;promotion of religion&quot;.
