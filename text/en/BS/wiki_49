<text>The Popish Plot was a fictitious conspiracy invented by Titus Oates that between 1678 and 1681 gripped the kingdoms of England and Scotland in anti-Catholic hysteria. Oates alleged that there was an extensive Catholic conspiracy to assassinate Charles II, accusations that led to the show trials and executions of at least 22 men and precipitated the Exclusion Bill Crisis. During this tumultuous period, Oates weaved an intricate web of accusations, fueling public fears and paranoia. However, as time went on, the lack of substantial evidence and inconsistencies in Oates&#x27;s testimony began to unravel the plot. Eventually, Oates himself was arrested and convicted for perjury, exposing the fabricated nature of the conspiracy.

== Background ==
===Development of English anti-Catholicism===
The fictitious Popish Plot must be understood against the background of the English Reformation and the subsequent development of a strong anti-Catholic nationalist sentiment among the mostly Protestant population of England.

The English Reformation began in 1533, when King Henry VIII (1509–1547) sought an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon to marry Anne Boleyn. As the Pope would not grant this, Henry broke away from Rome and took control of the Church in England. Later, he had the monasteries dissolved, causing opposition in the still largely Catholic nation. Under Henry&#x27;s son Edward VI (1547–1553), the Church of England was transformed into a strictly Protestant body, with many remnants of Catholicism suppressed. Edward was succeeded by his half-sister Mary I of England (1553–1558), daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine. She was a Catholic and returned the Church in England to union with the Holy See. Mary tainted her policy with two unpopular actions: she married her cousin, King Philip II of Spain, where the Inquisition continued, and had 300 Protestants burned at the stake, causing many Englishmen to associate Catholicism with the involvement of foreign powers and religious persecution.

Mary was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth I (1558–1603), who again broke away from Rome and suppressed Catholicism. Elizabeth and later Protestant monarchs caused to be hanged and mutilated hundreds of Catholic priests and laymen. This, and her dubious legitimacy – she was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn – led to Catholic powers not recognising her as queen and favouring her next relative, the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots. Elizabeth&#x27;s reign saw Catholic rebellions like the Rising of the North (1569) as well as intrigues like the Ridolfi Plot (1571) and the Babington Plot (1586), both intending to kill Elizabeth and replace her with Mary under a Spanish invasion. Three popes issued bulls judging Elizabeth, giving grounds to suspect English Catholics&#x27; loyalty. Following the Babington Plot, Mary was beheaded in 1587. This – and Elizabeth&#x27;s support of the Dutch Revolt in the Spanish Netherlands – triggered Philip II of Spain&#x27;s attempted invasion with the Spanish Armada (1588). This reinforced English resentment of Catholics, while the Armada&#x27;s failure convinced many Englishmen that God was on the Protestant side.

Anti-Catholic sentiment reached new heights in 1605 after the failed Gunpowder Plot. Catholic conspirators attempted to topple the Protestant reign of King James I by exploding a bomb during the King&#x27;s opening of parliament. The plot was thwarted when Guy Fawkes, who was in charge of the explosives, was discovered the night before. The magnitude of the plot, meant to kill the leading government figures in one stroke, convinced many Englishmen that Catholics were murderous conspirators who would stop at nothing to have their way, laying the groundwork for future allegations.

===Anti-Catholicism in the 17th century===
Anti-Catholic sentiment was a constant factor in how England perceived the events of the following decades: the Thirty Years War (1618–1648) was seen as an attempt by the Catholic Habsburgs to exterminate German Protestantism. Under the early Stuart Kings, fears of Catholic conspiracies were rampant and the policies of Charles I – especially his church policies, which had a decidedly high church bent – were seen as pro-Catholic and likely induced by a Catholic conspiracy headed by Charles&#x27; Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria of France. This, together with accounts of Catholic atrocities in Ireland in 1641, helped trigger the English Civil War (1642–1649), which led to the abolition of the monarchy and a decade of Puritan rule tolerating most forms of Protestantism, but not Catholicism. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 under King Charles II brought a reaction against all religious dissenters outside the established Church of England. Catholics still suffered under popular hostility and legal discrimination.

Anti-Catholic hysteria flared up lightly during the reign of Charles II, which saw disasters such as the Great Plague of London (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666). Vague rumours blamed the fire on arson by Catholics and especially Jesuits. Kenyon remarks, &quot;At Coventry, the townspeople were possessed by the idea that the papists were about to rise and cut their throats ... A nationwide panic seemed likely, and as homeless refugees poured out from London into the countryside, they took with them stories of a kind which were to be familiar enough in 1678 and 1679.&quot;

Anti-Catholicism was fueled by doubts about the religious allegiance of the King, who had been supported by the Catholic powers during his exile, and had married a Portuguese Catholic princess, Catherine of Braganza. Charles formed an alliance with the leading Catholic power France against the Protestant Netherlands. Furthermore, Charles&#x27; brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, had embraced Catholicism, although his brother forbade him to make any public avowal. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, in which he suspended all penal laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters. This fueled Protestant fears of increasing Catholic influence in England, and led to conflict with parliament during the 1670s. In December 1677 an anonymous pamphlet (possibly by Andrew Marvell) spread alarm in London by accusing the Pope of plotting to overthrow the lawful government of England.

==Events==
===Beginnings===
The fictitious Popish Plot unfolded in a very peculiar fashion. Oates and Israel Tonge, a fanatically anti-Catholic clergyman (who was widely believed to be insane), had written a large manuscript that accused the Catholic Church authorities of approving the assassination of Charles II. The Jesuits in England were to carry out the task. The manuscript also named nearly 100 Jesuits and their supporters who were supposedly involved in this assassination plot; nothing in the document was ever proven to be true.

Oates slipped a copy of the manuscript into the wainscot of a gallery in the house of the physician Sir Richard Barker, with whom Tonge was living. The following day Tonge claimed to find the manuscript and showed it to an acquaintance, Christopher Kirkby, who was shocked and decided to inform the King. Kirkby was a chemist and a former assistant in Charles&#x27; scientific experiments, and Charles prided himself on being approachable to the general public. On 13 August 1678, whilst Charles was out walking in St. James&#x27;s Park, the chemist informed him of the plot. Charles was dismissive but Kirkby stated that he knew the names of assassins who planned to shoot the King and, if that failed, the Queen&#x27;s physician, Sir George Wakeman, would poison him. When the King demanded proof, the chemist offered to bring Tonge who knew of these matters personally. The King did agree to see both Kirkby and Tonge that evening, when he gave them a short audience. At this stage, he was already sceptical, but he was apparently not ready to rule out the possibility that there might be a plot of some sort (otherwise, Kenyon argues, he would not have given these two very obscure men a private audience). Charles told Kirkby to present Tonge to Thomas Osborne, Lord Danby, Lord High Treasurer, then the most influential of the King&#x27;s ministers. Tonge then lied to Danby, saying that he had found the manuscript but did not know the author.

===Investigations===
As Kenyon points out, the government took seriously even the remotest hint of a threat to the King&#x27;s life or well-being – in the previous spring a Newcastle housewife had been investigated by the Secretary of State simply for saying that &quot;the King gets the curse of many good and faithful wives such as myself for his bad example&quot;. Danby, who seems to have believed in the Plot, advised the King to order an investigation. Charles II denied the request, maintaining that the entire affair was absurd. He told Danby to keep the events secret so as not to put the idea of regicide into people&#x27;s minds. However, word of the manuscript spread to the Duke of York, who publicly called for an investigation into the matter. Even Charles admitted that given the sheer number of allegations, he could not say positively that none of them was true, and reluctantly agreed. During the investigation, Oates&#x27; name arose. From the first, the King was convinced that Oates was a liar, and Oates did not help his case by claiming to have met the regent of Spain, Don John of Austria. Questioned by the King, who had met Don John in Brussels in 1656, it became obvious that Oates had no idea what he looked like. The King had a long and frank talk with Paul Barillon, the French ambassador, in which he made it clear that he did not believe that there was a word of truth in the plot, and that Oates was &quot;a wicked man&quot;; but that by now he had come round to the view that there must be an investigation, particularly with Parliament about to reassemble.

On 6 September Oates was summoned before the magistrate Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey to swear an oath prior to his testimony before the King. Oates claimed he had been at a Jesuit meeting held at the White Horse Tavern in the Strand, London, on April 24, 1678. According to Oates, the purpose of that meeting was to discuss the assassination of Charles II. The meeting discussed a variety of methods which included: stabbing by Irish ruffians, shooting by two Jesuit soldiers, or poisoning by the Queen&#x27;s physician, Sir George Wakeman.

Oates and Tonge were brought before the Privy Council later that month, and the Council interrogated Oates for several hours; Tonge, who was generally believed to be mad, was simply laughed at, but Oates made a much better impression on the council. On 28 September Oates made 43 allegations against various members of Catholic religious orders – including 541 Jesuits – and numerous Catholic nobles. He accused Sir George Wakeman and Edward Colman, the secretary to Mary of Modena Duchess of York, of planning the assassination. Colman was found to have corresponded with the French Jesuit Fr Ferrier, confessor to Louis XIV, outlining his grandiose schemes for obtaining a dissolution of the present Parliament, in the hope of its replacement by a new and pro-French Parliament; in the wake of this revelation he was condemned to death for treason. Wakeman was later acquitted. Despite Oates&#x27; unsavoury reputation, the councillors were impressed by his confidence, his grasp of detail and his remarkable memory. A turning point came when he was shown five letters, supposedly written by well-known priests and giving details of the plot, which he was suspected of forging: Oates &quot;at a single glance&quot; named each of the alleged authors. At this the council were &quot;amazed&quot; and began to give much greater credence to the plot; apparently it did not occur to them that Oates&#x27; ability to recognise the letters made it &quot;more&quot; likely, rather than less, that he had forged them.

Others Oates accused included Dr. William Fogarty, Archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin, Samuel Pepys and John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse. The list grew to 81 accusations. Oates was given a squad of soldiers and he began to round up Jesuits.

===Godfrey&#x27;s murder===
The allegations gained little credence until the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a magistrate and strong supporter of Protestantism, to whom Oates had made his first depositions. His disappearance on 12 October 1678, the finding of his mutilated body on 17 October, and the subsequent failure to solve his murder sent the Protestant population into an uproar. He had been strangled and run through with his own sword. Many of his supporters blamed the murder on Catholics. As Kenyon commented, &quot;Next day, the 18th, James wrote to William of Orange that Godfrey&#x27;s death was already &#x27;laid against the Catholics&#x27;, and even he, never the most realistic of men, feared that &#x27;all these things happening together will cause a great flame in the Parliament&#x27;.&quot; The Lords asked King Charles to banish all Catholics from a radius of around London, which Charles granted on 30 October 1678, but it was too late because London was already in a panic, which was long remembered as &quot;Godfrey&#x27;s autumn&quot;.

Oates seized on Godfrey&#x27;s murder as proof that the plot was true. The murder of Godfrey and the discovery of Edward Coleman&#x27;s letters provided a solid basis of facts for the lies of Oates and the other informers who followed him. Oates was called to testify before the House of Lords and the House of Commons on 23 October 1678. He testified that he had seen a number of contracts signed by the Superior General of the Jesuits. The contracts appointed officers that would command an army of Catholic supporters to kill Charles II and establish a Catholic monarch. To this day, no one is certain who killed Sir Edmund Godfrey, and most historians regard the mystery as insoluble. Oates&#x27; associate William Bedloe denounced the silversmith Miles Prance, who in turn named three working men, Berry, Green and Hill, who were tried, convicted and executed in February 1679; but it rapidly became clear that they were completely innocent, and that Prance, who had been subjected to torture, named them simply to gain his freedom (Kenyon suggests that he may have chosen men against whom he had a personal grudge, or he may simply have chosen them because they were the first Catholic acquaintances of his who came to mind).

===The Plot before Parliament===
King Charles, aware of the unrest, returned to London and summoned Parliament. He remained unconvinced by Oates&#x27; accusations, but Parliament and public opinion forced him to order an investigation. Parliament truly believed that this plot was real, declaring, &quot;This House is of opinion that there hath been and still is a damnable and hellish plot contrived and carried out by the popish recusants for assigning and murdering the King.&quot; Tonge was called to testify on 25 October 1678 where he gave evidence on the Great Fire and, later, rumours of another similar plot. On 1 November, both Houses ordered an investigation in which a Frenchman, Choqueux, was discovered to be storing gunpowder in a house nearby. This caused a panic, until it was discovered that he was simply the King&#x27;s firework maker.

===Trial of the Five Catholic Lords===
Oates became more daring and accused five Catholic lords (William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour, William Petre, 4th Baron Petre and John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse) of involvement in the plot. The King dismissed the accusations as absurd, pointing out that Belasyse was so afflicted with gout that he could hardly stand, while Arundell and Stafford, who had not been on speaking terms for 25 years, were most unlikely to be intriguing together; but Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury had the lords arrested and sent to the Tower on 25 October 1678. Seizing upon the anti-Catholic tide, Shaftesbury publicly demanded that the King&#x27;s brother, James, be excluded from the royal succession, prompting the Exclusion crisis. On 5 November 1678, people burned effigies of the Pope instead of those of Guy Fawkes. At the end of the year, the parliament passed a bill, a second Test Act, excluding Catholics from membership of both Houses (a law not repealed until 1829).

On 1 November 1678, the House of Commons resolved to proceed by impeachment against &quot;the five popish lords&quot;. On 23 November all Arundell&#x27;s papers were seized and examined by the Lords&#x27; committee; on 3 December the five peers were arraigned for high treason; and on 5 December the Commons announced the impeachment of Arundell. A month later Parliament was dissolved, and the proceedings were interrupted. In March 1679, it was resolved by both houses that the dissolution had not invalidated the motions for the impeachment. On 10 April 1679 Arundell and three of his companions (Belasyse was too ill to attend) were brought to the House of Lords to put in pleas against the articles of impeachment. Arundell complained of the uncertainty of the charges, and implored the peers to have them &quot;reduced to competent certainty&quot; but on 24 April this plea was voted irregular, and on 26 April the prisoners were again brought to the House of Lords and ordered to amend their pleas. Arundell replied by briefly declaring himself not guilty.

The impeachment trial was fixed for 13 May, but a quarrel between the two houses as to points of procedure, and the legality of admitting the bishops as judges in a capital trial, followed by a dissolution, delayed its commencement until 30 November 1680. On that day it was decided to proceed first against Lord Stafford, who was condemned to death on 7 December and beheaded on 29 December. His trial, compared to the other Plot trials, was reasonably fair, but as in all cases of alleged treason at that date the absence of defence counsel was a fatal handicap (this was finally remedied in 1695), and while Oates&#x27; credit had been seriously damaged, the evidence of the principal prosecution witnesses, Turberville and Dugdale, struck even fair-minded observers like John Evelyn as being credible enough. Stafford, denied the services of counsel, failed to exploit several inconsistencies in Tuberville&#x27;s testimony, which a good lawyer might have turned to his client&#x27;s advantage.

On 30 December, the evidence against Arundell and his three fellow prisoners was ordered to be in readiness, but their public proceedings stopped. In fact, the death of William Bedloe left the prosecution in serious difficulties, since one protection for a person accused of treason, that there must be two eyewitnesses to an overt act of treason, was observed scrupulously, and only Oates claimed to have any hard evidence against the remaining Lords. Lord Petre died in the Tower in 1683. His companions remained there until 12 February 1684 when an appeal to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench to release them on bail was successful. On 21 May 1685 Arundell, Powis, and Belasyse came to the House of Lords to present petitions for the annulling of the charges and on the following day the petitions were granted. On 1 June 1685, their liberty was formally assured on the ground that the witnesses against them had perjured themselves, and on 4 June the bill of attainder against Stafford was reversed.

===Height of the hysteria===

On 24 November 1678, Oates claimed the Queen was working with the King&#x27;s physician to poison him and enlisted the aid of &quot;Captain&quot; William Bedloe, a notorious member of the London underworld. The King personally interrogated Oates, caught him out in a number of inaccuracies and lies, and ordered his arrest. However, a few days later, with the threat of constitutional crisis, Parliament forced the release of Oates.

Hysteria continued: Roger North wrote that it was as though &quot;the very Cabinet of Hell has been opened&quot;. Noblewomen carried firearms if they had to venture outdoors at night. Houses were searched for hidden guns, mostly without any significant result. Some Catholic widows tried to ensure their safety by marrying Anglican widowers. The House of Commons was searched – without result – in the expectation of a second Gunpowder Plot.

Anyone even suspected of being Catholic was driven out of London and forbidden to be within ten miles (16 km) of the city. William Staley, a young Catholic banker, made a drunken threat against the King; within 10 days he was tried, convicted of plotting treason and executed. In calmer times, Staley&#x27;s offence would probably have resulted in him being bound over, a mild punishment. Oates, for his part, received a state apartment in Whitehall and an annual allowance. He soon presented new allegations, claiming assassins intended to shoot the King with silver bullets so the wound would not heal. The public invented their own stories, including a tale that the sound of digging had been heard near the House of Commons and rumours of a French invasion on the Isle of Purbeck. The evidence of Oates and Bedloe was supplemented by other informers; some like Thomas Dangerfield, were notorious criminals, but others like Stephen Dugdale, Robert Jenison and Edward Turberville were men of good social standing who from motives of greed or revenge denounced innocent victims, and by their apparently plausible evidence made the Plot seem more credible. Dugdale in particular made such a good initial impression that even the King for the first time &quot;began to think that there might be somewhat in the Plot&quot;.

===Waning of the hysteria===
However, public opinion began to turn against Oates. As Kenyon points out, the steady protestations of innocence by all of those who were executed eventually took hold in the public mind. Outside London, the priests who died were almost all venerable and popular members of the community, and there was widespread public horror at their executions. Even Lord Shaftesbury came to regret the executions and is said to have quietly ordered the release of particular priests, whose families he knew. Accusations of plotting in Yorkshire (the &quot;Barnbow Plot&quot;), where prominent local Catholics like Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 2nd Baronet were accused of signing &quot;the Bloody Oath of Secrecy&quot;, were unsuccessful because their Protestant neighbours (who sat on the juries) refused to convict them. A grand jury at Westminster rejected the plotting charge against Sir John Fitzgerald, 2nd Baronet in 1681. Judges gradually began to take a more impartial line, ruling that it was not treason for a Catholic to advocate the conversion of England to the old faith, nor to give financial support to religious houses (the latter was a criminal offence, just not treason). The supposed plot gained some credence in Ireland, where the two Catholic Archbishops, Plunkett and Talbot, were the principal victims, but not in Scotland.

Having had at least twenty-two innocent men executed (the last being Oliver Plunkett, the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh on 1 July 1681), Chief Justice William Scroggs began to declare people innocent and the King began to devise countermeasures. The King, who was notably tolerant of religious differences and generally inclined to clemency, was embittered at the number of innocent men he had been forced to condemn; possibly thinking of the Indemnity and Oblivion Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. 11), under which he had pardoned many of his former opponents in 1660, he remarked that his people had never previously had cause to complain of his mercy. At the trial of Sir George Wakeman, and several priests who were tried with him, Scroggs virtually ordered the jury to acquit all of them, and despite public uproar, the King made it clear that he approved of Scroggs&#x27; conduct. On 31 August 1681, Oates was told to leave his apartments in Whitehall, but remained undeterred and even denounced the King and the Duke of York. He was arrested for sedition, sentenced to a fine of £100,000 and thrown into prison.

When James II acceded to the throne in 1685 he had Oates tried on two charges of perjury. The Bench which tried him was presided over by the formidable George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys, who conducted the trial in such a manner that Oates had no hope of acquittal, and the jury brought in the expected guilty verdict. The death penalty was not available for perjury and Oates was sentenced to be stripped of clerical dress, whipped through London twice, and imprisoned for life and pilloried every year (the penalties were so severe that it has been argued that Jeffreys was trying to kill Oates by ill-treatment). Oates spent the next three years in prison. At the accession of William of Orange and Mary in 1689, he was pardoned and granted a pension of £260 a year, but his reputation did not recover. The pension was suspended, but in 1698 was restored and increased to £300 a year. Oates died on 12 or 13 July 1705, quite forgotten by the public which had once called him a hero.

Of the other informers, James II was content merely to fine Miles Prance for his perjury, on the grounds that he was a Catholic and had been coerced by threats of torture into informing. Thomas Dangerfield was subjected to the same savage penalties as Oates; on returning from his first session in the pillory, Dangerfield died of an eye injury after a scuffle with the barrister Robert Francis, who was hanged for his murder. Bedloe, Turbervile and Dugdale had all died of natural causes while the Plot was still officially regarded as true.

==Long-term effects==
The Society of Jesus suffered the most between 1678 and 1681. During this period, nine Jesuits were executed and twelve died in prison. Three other deaths were attributable to the hysteria. They also lost Combe in Herefordshire, which was the Jesuit headquarters for south Wales. A quote from French Jesuit Claude de la Colombière highlights the plight of the Jesuits during this time period. He comments, &quot;The name of the Jesuit is hated above all else, even by priests both secular and regular, and by the Catholic laity as well, because it is said that the Jesuits have caused this raging storm, which is likely to overthrow the whole Catholic religion&quot;.

Other Catholic religious orders such as the Carmelites, Franciscans, and the Benedictines were also affected by the hysteria. They were no longer permitted to have more than a certain number of members or missions within England. John Kenyon points out that European religious orders throughout the Continent were affected since many of them depended on the alms of the English Catholic community for their existence. Many Catholic priests were arrested and tried because the Privy Council wanted to make sure to catch all of those who might possess information about the supposed plot.

The hysteria had serious consequences for ordinary British Catholics as well as priests. On 30 October 1678, a proclamation was made that required all Catholics who were not tradesmen or property owners to leave London and Westminster. They were not to enter a twelve-mile (c.19 km) radius of the city without special permission. Throughout this period Catholics were subject to fines, harassment and imprisonment. It was not until the early 19th century that most of the anti-Catholic legislation was removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829; anti-Catholic sentiment remained even longer among politicians and the general populace, although the Gordon Riots of 1780 made it clear to sensible observers that Catholics were far more likely to be the victims of violence than its perpetrators.

<text>Jane Jensen (born January 28, 1963) is an American video game designer and author. She is the creator of the &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; series of adventure games, and also co-founded Oberon Media and Pinkerton Road video game development companies. Jensen also writes under the name Eli Easton.

==Early life and education==
Jensen was born Jane Elizabeth Smith, on January 28, 1963, in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, the youngest of seven children. She attended and graduated from Allentown Central Catholic High School, and then received a BA in computer science from Anderson University in Anderson, Indiana.

==Career==
She worked as a systems programmer for Hewlett-Packard.

Her love of both computers and creative writing eventually led her to the computer gaming industry and Sierra OnLine, where she worked as a writer on &quot;Police Quest III: The Kindred&quot; and &quot;EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus&quot;. After co-designing &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot; with veteran game designer Roberta Williams, Jensen designed her first solo game: &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot;, which was released in 1993. The dark, supernatural mystery was a departure for Sierra but the game was enthusiastically received, with the strength of Jensen&#x27;s writing, along with the game&#x27;s horror and gothic sensibilities coming in for particular praise from the gaming press and earning the &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award.

Jensen followed up &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; with two sequels: &quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; in 1999. Somewhat unusually for an adventure game series, each &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; title was produced in an entirely different format to the others. Whereas the original was a traditional 2D animated game, the sequels were realised through full motion video and a custom built 3D engine, respectively. Despite further acclaim for Jensen&#x27;s design in both cases (&quot;The Beast Within&quot; too was &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; &quot;Game of the Year&quot;), the large expenses associated with making the sequels, coupled with the declining marketability of adventure games (especially within Sierra) meant that a fourth in the series was not commissioned.

In 1997, Jensen published a novelization of the first &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; game. A second &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; novelization followed in 1998. In 1999, Jensen published her first non-adapted novel, &quot;Millennium Rising&quot; (later retitled &quot;Judgment Day&quot;). Her fourth book, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Equation&quot; was published in 2003 and was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award.

Jensen has been involved in designing casual online games at Oberon Media, of which she is a co-founder. Her work in the hidden object/light adventure category can partially be credited with moving casual games in the direction of full adventure games in puzzle and story sophistication. Some of her more notable recent games include &quot;Deadtime Stories&quot; (2009) and &quot;Dying for Daylight&quot; (2010). After leaving Oberon in 2011, she briefly worked at Zynga.

Jensen&#x27;s next big adventure game &quot;Gray Matter&quot; was developed by Wizarbox and published by dtp entertainment in 2010. The game, originally intended to be developed by Hungarian software house Tonuzaba, switched to another developer, French company Wizarbox in 2008: as a result, the tentative release was changed and shifted to 2010. Jensen was also a story consultant on Phoenix Online Studios&#x27; 2012 adventure game &quot;&quot;.

On April 5, 2012, Jensen and her husband Robert Holmes announced the formation of Pinkerton Road, a new game development studio to be headquartered on their Lancaster, Pennsylvania farm. With this announcement, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise funds for the studio&#x27;s first year of game development. In 2014, Pinkerton released their first games, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;.

Since 2013, Jensen has written gay romance fiction under the pen name &quot;Eli Easton&quot;. &quot;The Lion and the Crow&quot; was written for the Goodreads M/M Romance event &quot;Love has No Boundaries&quot; in 2013, and later expanded and rereleased as a second edition in e-book and audiobook.

==Personal life==
Jensen owned a farm in Pennsylvania, where she lived with her husband, composer Robert Holmes, who composed the music for the &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; series and &quot;Gray Matter&quot;. They have since sold the farm and are currently living in the Puget Sound area of Washington state.

<text>Partisan Review (&quot;PR&quot;) was a left-wing small-circulation quarterly &quot;little magazine&quot; dealing with literature, politics, and cultural commentary published in New York City. The magazine was launched in 1934 by the Communist Party USA–affiliated John Reed Club of New York City and was initially part of the Communist political orbit. Growing disaffection on the part of &quot;PR&quot;″s primary editors began to make itself felt, and the magazine abruptly suspended publication in the fall of 1936. When the magazine reemerged late in 1937, it came with additional editors and new writers who advanced a political line deeply critical of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union.

By the 1950s, the magazine had evolved towards a moderate social democratic and staunchly anti-Stalinist perspective and was generally supportive of American foreign policy. &quot;Partisan Review&quot; received covert funding from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the agency&#x27;s efforts to shape intellectual opinion during the Cold War. The journal moved its offices to the campus of Rutgers University in 1963, then to the campus of Boston University in 1978. The final issue of the publication appeared in April 2003.

==Publication history==
===Establishment===
The literary journal &quot;Partisan Review (PR)&quot; was launched in New York City in 1934 by the John Reed Club of New York — a mass organization of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA). The publication was published and edited by two members of the New York club, Philip Rahv and William Phillips. The launch of the magazine was assisted by the editors of &quot;New Masses,&quot; the Communist Party&#x27;s national artistic and literary magazine, including Joseph Freeman.

Early issues of the magazine included a mixture of ostensibly proletarian literature and essays of cultural commentary — the latter of which became a hallmark of &quot;PR&quot; for the whole of its nearly seven decades of existence. Rahv and Phillips were strongly committed to the idea that radical new artistic forms and radical politics could be successfully combined and were critical of much of the form and hackneyed content of much of what passed as &quot;proletarian literature&quot;. This critical perspective brought the pair into conflict with party stalwarts at the &quot;New Masses&quot; such as Mike Gold and Granville Hicks but was not sufficient to break &quot;Partisan Review&quot; from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) orbit.

In 1936 as part of its Popular Front strategy of uniting Communist and non-Communist intellectuals against fascism, the CPUSA launched a new mass organization called the League of American Writers, abandoning the John Reed Clubs as part of the change. &quot;PR&quot; editors Phillips and Rahv were disaffected by the change, seeing the new organization as a watering down and mainstreaming of the party&#x27;s commitment to a new, radical, proletarian literature. Intellectual interest turned to events abroad and interest in &quot;PR&quot; faltered to the point that effective with its October 1936 issue, publication of the magazine was suspended.

===1937 relaunch===
While &quot;Partisan Review&quot; was relaunched by Rahv and Phillips in December 1937, it was changed at a fundamental level. News of the Great Purge in the Soviet Union and of Soviet duplicity in the Spanish Civil War pushed the pair of editors to a new outspokenly critical perspective. A new cast of editors were brought on board, including Dwight Macdonald and literary critic F. W. Dupee, and a sympathy for Trotskyism began to make itself felt in the magazine&#x27;s editorial political line. The CPUSA press was hostile, claiming that a party asset had been stolen. A new group of left-wing writers deeply critical of the Soviet Union began to write for the publication, including James Burnham and Sidney Hook. The new period of independence had begun.

Effective with the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, the magazine began to divorce itself from the Communist movement altogether, including its dissident Trotskyist wing. Rahv and Phillips gave qualified support to the campaign for American rearmament and the country&#x27;s preparation for war, opposed by Macdonald and another editor at the time, Clement Greenberg. A tentative truce between the editors averted a split, with Macdonald finally departing in 1943 to form the pacifist magazine &quot;politics&quot;.

Anti-Communism began to loom in the &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; of &quot;Partisan Review&quot; in the post-war years and bolstered by the contributions of such writers as Hook, James Farrell, George Orwell, and Arthur Koestler, the political trajectory of &quot;PR&quot; moved rightwards. Increasingly conservative and nationalist, by the early 1950s the magazine had become devoutly supportive of American virtues and values, although critical of the country&#x27;s biases and excesses. Orwell had been the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;″s London correspondent.

=== Funding by the CIA ===
Although vehemently denied by founding editor William Phillips, following the fall of the Soviet Union it was revealed that &quot;Partisan Review&quot; was the recipient of money from the Central Intelligence Agency as part of its effort to shape intellectual opinion in the so-called &quot;cultural cold war&quot;. In 1953, the magazine found itself in financial difficulties, when one of its primary backstage financial backers, Allan D. Dowling, became embroiled in a costly divorce proceeding. The financial shortfall was made up by a $2,500 grant from the American Committee for Cultural Freedom (ACCF), a CIA front organization on the executive board of which editor Phillips sat throughout the decade of the 1950s.

Additional CIA money came later in the 1950s. When the ACCF terminated its operations, half of the money remaining in the organization&#x27;s coffers was transferred to &quot;Partisan Review.&quot; Additional funds came to the magazine to alleviate its financial problems in the 1950s in the form of a $10,000 donation from &quot;Time&quot; magazine publisher Henry Luce. Luce seems to have been instrumental in expediting contacts between &quot;PR&quot; publisher Phillips and Director of Central Intelligence Walter Bedell Smith.

A successor organization established by the CIA to funnel money to sympathetic groups and individuals, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, stepped up to assist the magazine in the early 1960s, granting &quot;PR&quot; $3,000 a year for a three-year period in the guise of foreign magazine subscriptions.

===Moves to Rutgers and Boston University===

In 1963, William Phillips negotiated a move of the editorial offices of &quot;Partisan Review&quot; to the campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The university agreed to provide not only free office space and utilities, but also to cover the salary of an editor, an assistant editor, a secretary, and various graduate assistants to help with office tasks. In return, the university would gain prestige from association with the well-regarded literary journal and make uses of the services of the editor and assistant editor as lecturers in the school&#x27;s English Department.

This arrangement proved satisfactory for both parties until June 1978, when Phillips approached the University&#x27;s then-mandatory faculty retirement age of 70. Learning that no exception would be made for him, Phillips began shopping for a new home for &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. The decision was ultimately made to relocate the magazine&#x27;s editorial offices to Boston University, where publication would be continued under the editorship of Phillips and Steven Marcus, with Edith Kurzweil remaining as the magazine&#x27;s Executive Editor. Under terms of the new hosting agreement, ownership rights of &quot;Partisan Review&#x27;s&quot; extensive archive were to be transferred to the new institution.

Having invested more than $1 million in &quot;Partisan Review&quot; over the years and stored the publication&#x27;s archive since 1963, Rutgers physically blocked the transfer of &quot;PR&#x27;s&quot; files to the new institution. A standoff resulted and attorneys for both parties hastily came to an agreement by which Phillips was allowed to remove back issues, financial files, and current documents necessary for the magazine&#x27;s publication to Boston University with Rutgers holding the archival originals until the matter could be legally settled. An inventory of the magazine&#x27;s papers was conducted and photocopies of critical documents made and the matter headed for court. 

In the lawsuit which followed, Phillips ultimately prevailing based on his contention that the magazine&#x27;s records had been housed at Rutgers merely as a revokable &quot;deposit&quot; rather than a permanent gift. Rutgers was allowed to microfilm the magazine&#x27;s pre-1978 records with the originals were transferred to Boston University. 

The magazine&#x27;s circulation was 8,150 in 1989.

===Termination and legacy===
Phillips died in September 2002 at the age of 94. The journal continued under his wife, Edith Kurzweil, at Boston University, until ceasing publication in April 2003.

<doc id="547791" wikidata="Q7345586" url="?curid=547791" title="Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)">
<text>Robert Colin Holmes (2 April 1926 – 24 May 1986) was a British television scriptwriter. For over 25 years, he contributed to some of the most popular programmes screened in the UK. He is particularly remembered for his work on science fiction programmes, most notably his extensive contributions to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which included working as its script editor from 1974 to 1977.

Holmes suffered ill health from the early 1980s. He died in May 1986 while working on scripts for the second and final Sixth Doctor season &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;; his last serial as sole writer, &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;, and &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;, of which he only wrote the first part (the second being completed by Pip and Jane Baker), were released posthumously between September and December 1986.

==Early career==
In 1944, at the age of 18, Holmes joined the army, fighting with the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders regiment in Burma. He rapidly earned a commission, and as such became the youngest commissioned officer in the entire British army during the Second World War. The fact that he lied about his age to get into the army was discovered at his commissioning, but apparently the only reaction was by a general who praised him, adding that he had done the same thing himself.

Soon after the end of the war, Holmes returned to England and left the army, deciding to join the police. He trained at Hendon Police College, graduating the top of his year and joining the Metropolitan Police in London, serving at Bow Street Police Station.

It was whilst serving as a police officer that Holmes first began to develop an interest in writing as a career. When giving evidence in court for prosecutions against offenders, he would often note the excitement and frantic work of the journalists reporting on the cases, and decided that he would like to do similar work. To this end, he taught himself shorthand in his spare time and eventually resigned from the Police force.

He quickly found work writing for both local and national newspapers, initially in London and later in the Midlands. He also filed reports for the Press Association, which could be syndicated to a variety of sources, such as local or foreign newspapers. In the late 1950s he worked for a time writing and editing short stories for magazines, before receiving his first break in television when he contributed an episode to the famous medical series &quot;Emergency – Ward 10&quot; (1957).

==Television==
Holmes found himself working almost exclusively in television drama after 1957. He began contributing episodes regularly to the adventure series &quot;Knight Errant&quot; before becoming that programme&#x27;s story editor in 1959. He wrote several episodes of another medical drama, &quot;Dr. Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot;, before in the early 1960s writing for a range of crime-related dramas: &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Ghost Squad&quot;, &quot;Public Eye&quot; and &quot;Intrigue&quot; all dealt with law enforcement, and benefiting from Holmes&#x27; real-life experiences.

It was in 1965 that he first began writing in the science-fiction genre, when he contributed scripts to &quot;Undermind&quot;, a body-snatching drama from ITV. He also worked in film once, storylining the movie &quot;Invasion&quot;, several elements from which would later crop up in his 1970 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, and which had also been inspired by Nigel Kneale&#x27;s 1955 &quot;Quatermass II&quot; serial.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
The same year, Holmes wrote on-spec an idea for a stand-alone science-fiction serial entitled &quot;The Space Trap&quot;, which he submitted to the BBC. There, the Head of Drama Serials wrote back to Holmes, informing him that they were no longer interested in producing such serials, but that he might have better luck if he tried submitting it to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production office. This he did, and had a fruitful meeting with the show&#x27;s then story editor Donald Tosh; but when Tosh left the programme shortly afterwards, the script was forgotten and Holmes moved on to other projects.

In 1968, after some work on other projects appeared to be falling through, Holmes decided on the off-chance to re-submit &quot;The Space Trap&quot; to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; office, and again found a favourable response, this time from Assistant Script Editor Terrance Dicks, who developed it with Holmes to cover the eventuality of an agreed script falling through. At the beginning of the sixth season, there was no slot available for Holmes&#x27; script, but the production staff began experiencing a number of problems with scheduled scripts. &quot;The Dominators&quot;, the first story in the season, ended one episode earlier, resulting in an extra episode being tacked onto the following story, &quot;The Mind Robber&quot;. When the fourth six-part storyline fell through, the story before was extended by two episodes while Dicks worked with Holmes to adapt &quot;The Krotons&quot; to fill the rest of the gap in the schedule.

The story was regarded as a success by the production team, who quickly commissioned Holmes to write a second story for the season, &quot;The Space Pirates&quot;. This was originally planned to be four episodes long but was extended to become a six-parter when another story fell through. Holmes and Dicks got on very well, so when Dicks officially took over as script editor he frequently turned to Holmes for contributions.

Holmes wrote Jon Pertwee&#x27;s debut serial as the Third Doctor, &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, in 1970. During the early 1970s he also wrote for another BBC science-fiction show, &quot;Doomwatch&quot;, as well as other programmes such as the ATV series &quot;Spyder&#x27;s Web&quot;.

Holmes was commissioned to write the first story of season eight in 1971, &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;. The story was considered a great success. Holmes would go on to contribute two more stories in 1973, &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;. Holmes introduced two recurring alien races to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: the Autons and the Sontarans. Terrance Dicks intended to have Holmes replace him as script editor after he left. Holmes accepted the offer while the season was still in production, editing (uncredited) &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot;.

Holmes was known for his morbid sense of humour and his inclination to write dark and disturbing material. The previous producer Barry Letts often had Holmes tone down his writing, but Letts&#x27;s successor Philip Hinchcliffe wanted to take the programme in a darker and more dynamic direction along with the introduction of its new lead actor, Tom Baker.

Holmes continued as script editor for the next three years, seeing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; through one of its most successful eras in terms of both viewing figures and critical acclaim. Despite this, a number of stories came under fire from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association for their alleged excessive violence or frightening tone. Some of the most controversial stories were written by Holmes himself. A scene from Holmes&#x27; story &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, in which the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s head is held under water as the cliffhanger, led to BBC Director General Sir Charles Curran apologising to Mary Whitehouse for the offence caused. On 11 February 1977, the &quot;Daily Express &quot;published an interview with Holmes by Jean Rook under the title &quot;Who do you think you are, scaring my innocent child?&quot;, in which Holmes said &quot;Parents would be terribly irresponsible to leave a six-year-old to watch it alone. It&#x27;s geared to the intelligent fourteen-year-old, and I wouldn&#x27;t let any child under ten see it.&quot; The scene was removed from the master tape, and was absent from all rebroadcasts and home releases of the story until it was restored from home recordings for the DVD release.

During this time, Holmes wrote three of his own credited stories for the programme, performed complete ground-up rewrites on at least two other stories (which were broadcast under pseudonyms) and had a strong hand in almost every other script. It was very much his era of the show, although by 1977 he felt that he had done all he could for the programme. He had intended to leave at the end of the fourteenth season, but was persuaded to stay on for a short while by the new producer Graham Williams. While he script-edited the first two stories he commissioned for season 15, he left the third to his successor, Anthony Read. He also requested a last minute re-write so that K-9 would become an ongoing character. The difficult task of working him in was left to Read.

Nonetheless, Read was quick to turn to Holmes when it came to commissioning scripts for the sixteenth season, being keen to use writers who knew how the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; format was best used and could be relied upon to come up with usable scripts in good time. Holmes wrote two stories for the season, but after its broadcast in 1978, Holmes felt that he needed to distance himself from the programme. It would be six years before he wrote for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; again.

During this time he wrote for various series, such as the BBC science-fiction show &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, on which he had been offered the Script Editor&#x27;s post when it began in 1978, but declined as he had only just finished his role as such on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and was not keen to go back to such strenuous work so quickly. Instead, he recommended writer Chris Boucher, who he had used on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, to the Producer, and thus it was Boucher who in turn commissioned Holmes to write for the show. One of the most notorious moments in the series occurred in Holmes&#x27; episode &quot;Orbit&quot; in the fourth season of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, when Avon stalks Vila in a shuttle wanting to throw him off the ship. Other programmes Holmes worked on in the late seventies and early eighties included the police series &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; and an adaptation of the science-fiction novel &quot;Child of the Vodyoni&quot;, which was screened as &quot;The Nightmare Man&quot; in 1981. He also script-edited detective series &quot;Shoestring&quot;.

In 1983, the then-current &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production team of producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Eric Saward contacted Holmes about returning to script the planned twentieth anniversary special, due for broadcast that November. Holmes agreed and began writing the script. However, he found it increasingly difficult to include the many elements from the show&#x27;s past that Nathan-Turner had insisted on. After the rejection of his first outline, he eventually gave up on the assignment (the special was eventually scripted by Terrance Dicks). The ordeal did lead to a friendship between Saward and Holmes that would eventually lead to Holmes returning to the series for the following season.

When it came to writing the final story for the Fifth Doctor (played by Peter Davison), Saward commissioned Holmes to write the storyline as he felt that Holmes&#x27;s experience would allow him to create an epic departure for Davison and introduction of the Sixth Doctor. &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, as the 1984 story came to be titled, is widely regarded by fans as being one of the best in the programme&#x27;s entire run from 1963 onwards, being voted &quot;all-time number one&quot; story in a 2009 poll.

Holmes felt that Davison&#x27;s adventures had been too easy, and decided to &quot;put him through hell&quot;.

John Nathan-Turner wanted to shoot a story abroad for season 22, similar to previous seasons. The show&#x27;s then US distributor Lionheart initially offered to co-fund filming in America. Holmes was commissioned to write the story which was originally set in New Orleans. However, Lionheart suddenly backed out, and a number of other locations were considered. The production team settled on shooting in Seville. Holmes found &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; a difficult story, as Nathan-Turner had insisted that the Sontarans appear in it. Like much of season 22, the story came under fire for violence and disturbing content. Holmes was a vegetarian, so many themes in the story were deliberately intended to represent his views about eating meat and slaughtering animals for consumption. 

When &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned from hiatus in 1986, a new 14-episode story entitled &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; was conceived to span the entire length of the season. Holmes was asked to write the first four-part segment of the season, which he subtitled &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;. Production of the season was far from smooth – the growing tension between Nathan-Turner and Saward, a lack of faith in the production from BBC executives and Holmes&#x27;s own poor health made the process difficult.

Holmes was particularly upset at comments made by BBC drama executive Jonathan Powell regarding his opening four episodes. He eventually agreed to write the closing two episodes of the season. Holmes began writing the first episode, but died in May 1986 after a short illness. Eric Saward intervened and completed episode 13. Saward had agreed to write the final episode, but quickly left the production when he and Nathan-Turner were unable to agree on the ending. Nathan-Turner was forced to stand in as script editor while Pip and Jane Baker (who had written episodes nine through twelve) wrote episode 14.

His last work to be broadcast was an episode of the detective series &quot;Bergerac&quot;, another show script-edited by Chris Boucher, transmitted in 1987. He did little work outside of television, although he did novelize his script of &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; for Target Books in 1986. It was the 100th &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelization published by Target Books.

==Legacy==
Holmes&#x27; work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been discussed in numerous DVD documentaries, most notably &quot;Behind the Sofa&quot;, produced by Richard Molesworth, which appears on the DVD release of &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;.

Holmes&#x27; friend, fellow TV writer Roger Marshall, claimed Holmes&#x27; work never received the acclaim it deserved because Holmes did most of his work in series television as opposed to television plays or serials. &quot;In retrospect, he spent too much time tinkering around with lesser writers&#x27; work rather than getting on with his own&quot;.

Russell T Davies, head writer and producer for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s 21st-century revival, stated Holmes&#x27; serial &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; as his favourite story from the original series. He said he considered Holmes to be comparable with the greatest screenwriters, describing the first episode of &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; as having &quot;the best dialogue ever written. It&#x27;s up there with Dennis Potter... When the history of television drama comes to be written, Robert Holmes won&#x27;t be remembered at all because he only wrote genre stuff. And that, I reckon, is a real tragedy&quot;.

<doc id="547794" wikidata="Q93593" url="?curid=547794" title="Common subexpression elimination">
<text>In compiler theory, common subexpression elimination (CSE) is a compiler optimization that searches for instances of identical expressions (i.e., they all evaluate to the same value), and analyzes whether it is worthwhile replacing them with a single variable holding the computed value.

== Example ==
In the following code:

 a = b * c + g;
 d = b * c * e;

it may be worth transforming the code to:

 tmp = b * c;
 a = tmp + g;
 d = tmp * e;

if the cost of storing and retrieving codice_1 is less than the cost of calculating codice_2 an extra time.

== Principle ==
The possibility to perform CSE is based on available expression analysis (a data flow analysis). An expression codice_3 is available at a point &quot;p&quot; in a program if: 
* every path from the initial node to p evaluates codice_3 before reaching &quot;p&quot;,
* and there are no assignments to codice_5 or codice_6 after the evaluation but before &quot;p&quot;.

The cost/benefit analysis performed by an optimizer will calculate whether the cost of the store to codice_1 is less than the cost of the multiplication; in practice other factors such as which values are held in which registers are also significant.

Compiler writers distinguish two kinds of CSE:
* local common subexpression elimination works within a single basic block 
* global common subexpression elimination works on an entire procedure, 
Both kinds rely on data flow analysis of which expressions are available at which points in a program.

== Benefits ==
The benefits of performing CSE are great enough that it is a commonly used optimization.

In simple cases like in the example above, programmers may manually eliminate the duplicate expressions while writing the code. The greatest source of CSEs are intermediate code sequences generated by the compiler, such as for array indexing calculations, where it is not possible for the developer to manually intervene. In some cases language features may create many duplicate expressions. For instance, C macros, where macro expansions may result in common subexpressions not apparent in the original source code.

Compilers need to be judicious about the number of temporaries created to hold values. An excessive number of temporary values creates register pressure possibly resulting in spilling registers to memory, which may take longer than simply recomputing an arithmetic result when it is needed.

<doc id="547795" wikidata="Q813001" url="?curid=547795" title="Bear Mountain State Park">
<text>Bear Mountain State Park is a state park located on the west bank of the Hudson River in Rockland and Orange counties, New York. The park offers biking, hiking, boating, picnicking, swimming, cross-country skiing, cross-country running, sledding and ice skating. It also includes several facilities such as the Perkins Memorial Tower, the Trailside Museum and Zoo, the Bear Mountain Inn, a merry-go-round, a pool, and a skating rink. It also hosts the Bear Mountain Circle, where the historic Palisades Interstate Parkway and Bear Mountain Bridge meet. It is managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which is overseen by the State of New York.

==Geography==
The park includes Bear Mountain as well as Dunderberg Mountain and West Mountain. Fort Montgomery is adjacent to the north edge of the park, while Iona Island Bird Sanctuary is on the eastern edge in the Hudson River. The park is a separate entity from the adjacent Harriman State Park, which runs along the western edge of the park. It lies within the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.

==History==
During the American Revolution, when the British viewed control of the Hudson River as essential to dominating the American territories, the area that was to become the park saw several significant military engagements. In 1777, British troops routed Patriots at Fort Montgomery. Anthony Wayne&#x27;s attack of the British fort at Stony Point moved colonial troops to the west of Bear Mountain.

In 1908 the State of New York announced plans to relocate Sing Sing Prison to Bear Mountain. Work was begun in the area near Highland Lake (renamed Hessian Lake) and in January 1909, the state purchased the Bear Mountain tract. Conservationists inspired by the work of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission lobbied successfully for the creation of the Highlands of the Hudson Forest Preserve, stopping the prison from being built.

Mary Averell Harriman, whose husband, Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman died in September of that year, offered the state another and one million dollars toward the creation of a state park. George W. Perkins, with whom she had been working, raised another $1.5 million from a dozen wealthy contributors including John D. Rockefeller and J. Pierpont Morgan. New York State appropriated a matching $2.5 million and the state of New Jersey appropriated $500,000 to build the Henry Hudson Drive, (which would be succeeded by the Palisades Interstate Parkway in 1947).

Bear Mountain-Harriman State Park became a reality the following year when the prison was demolished and a dock built for steamboat excursion traffic; the following year a new West Shore Railroad station was built near the dock. In 1912, a replica of Henry Hudson&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Half Moon&quot; was built and moored at the dock. Major William A. Welch was hired as Chief Engineer, whose work for the park would win him recognition as the father of the state park movement (and later, the national park movement).

The park opened in June 1913. Steamboats alone brought more than 22,000 passengers to the park that year. Camping at Hessian Lake (and later at Lake Stahahe) was immensely popular; the average stay was eight days and was a favorite for Boy Scouts. By 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.

In the 1930s the federal government under Franklin D. Roosevelt was developing plans to preserve the environment as part of the Depression-era public works programs; the Civil Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration spent five years on projects at the park. Pump houses, reservoirs, sewer systems, vacation lodges, bathrooms, homes for park staff, storage buildings and an administration building were all created through these programs. 

The park continued to grow after its creation. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission began purchasing nearby Doodletown in the 1920s and completed the acquisition with eminent domain in the 1960s.

The park temporarily closed between July and August of 2023 after a storm struck the area on the 9th of July which damaged multiple pieces of infrastructure and washed out many trails in the park. Many of the park&#x27;s trails remained closed for the following couple of months, however a majority of the trails have since reopened.

==Facilities==

===Bear Mountain Inn===

Originally completed in 1915, the Bear Mountain Inn is an early example of the rustic lodge style influenced by the Adirondack Great Camps and later used extensively in the National Park System. It closed in 2005 for extended renovations, reopening in 2011.

===Perkins Memorial Drive===

The Perkins Memorial Drive is a scenic road to the summit of Bear Mountain. At the summit, the Perkins Memorial Tower provides a view of four states and the skyline of Manhattan, to the south. The road and tower were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1932 and 1934. It is named after George Wallbridge Perkins, the first president of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.

===Trailside Museums and Zoo===

The Trailside Museums and Zoo are located at the former site of Fort Clinton. Its name is a reference to the Appalachian Trail that runs through the complex. The zoo began as a bear den in 1926 and is currently the home of a wide variety of local injured or rehabilitating animals, including bears, otters, deer, bald eagles, and owls. The zoo&#x27;s popular otter died in June 2013, aged 19 years. The Reptile and Amphibian House has many species of fish, turtles, snakes and frogs. The Nature Study Museum was formed in 1921 for the Boy Scouts facility in the park from the original exhibits created by the American Museum of Natural History. The Geology Museum covers the Hudson Highlands and other local geology. The History Museum has exhibits about colonial and Native American culture. On February 11, 1962, 35,120 spectators turned out to watch the New York State Junior Ski Jumping Championship. More jump competitions were held at Bear Mountain than at any other ski jump in the United States. The ski jumps have not been used since 1990.

===Hiking===
There are over 50 official trails covering , featuring a wide range of difficulties and elevation changes.

The first section of the Appalachian Trail, taking hikers from Bear Mountain south to the Delaware Water Gap, opened on October 7, 1923 and served as a pattern for the other sections of the trail developed independently by local and regional organizations and later by the federal government. The Bear Mountain Zoo, through which the Appalachian Trail passes, is the lowest elevation on the trail. There are of the AT located in the park. In 2010, sections of the AT within the park were rebuilt by the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference, with stone steps to handle the 500,000 annual hikers. The Manhattan skyline can be seen from the top of Bear Mountain.

===Cross country running===
Bear Mountain also regularly hosts cross country running events during the fall season. High school cross country teams compete on the course, which mostly consists of paved walkways. Bear Mountain is the location for the County&#x27;s Championship race as well as the Rockland County Alumni Race, run every year since 1983.

=== Cruises ===
Several cruise lines operate cruises with views and trips to the park. These ships ride the Hudson River fifty miles from Manhattan in order to visit the park.

<text>The Lockheed YF-12 is an American Mach 3+ capable, high-altitude interceptor prototype, developed and manufactured by American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation.

The interceptor was developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s as a potential replacement for the F-106 Delta Dart interceptor for the United States Air Force (USAF). The YF-12 was a twin-seat version of the then-secret single-seat Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); unlike the A-12, it was furnished with the Hughes AN/ASG-18 fire-control radar and could be armed with AIM-47 Falcon (GAR-9) air-to-air missiles. Its maiden flight was on 7 August 1963. Its existence was publicly revealed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on 24 February 1964; this move was to provide plausible deniability for the CIA-operated A-12 fleet, which closely resembled the prototype YF-12.

During the 1960s, the YF-12 underwent flight evaluations by the USAF, but funding to put it into operational use was not forthcoming partly due to the pressing demands of the Vietnam War and other military priorities. It set and held speed and altitude world records of over and over (later surpassed by the closely related SR-71 Blackbird), and is the world&#x27;s largest, heaviest and fastest crewed interceptor. Following its retirement by the USAF, it served as a research aircraft for NASA for a time, which used it to develop several significant improvements in control for future supersonic aircraft.

==Design and development==
In the late 1950s, the United States Air Force (USAF) sought a replacement for its F-106 Delta Dart interceptor. As part of the Long Range Interceptor Experimental (LRI-X) program, the North American XF-108 Rapier, an interceptor with Mach 3 speed, was selected. However, the F-108 program was canceled by the Department of Defense in September 1959. During this time, Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works was developing the A-12 reconnaissance aircraft for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the &quot;Oxcart&quot; program. Kelly Johnson, the head of Skunk Works, proposed to build a version of the A-12 named AF-12 by the company; the USAF ordered three AF-12s in mid-1960.
The AF-12s took the seventh through ninth slots on the A-12 assembly line; these were designated as &quot;YF-12A&quot; interceptors. The main changes involved modifying the A-12&#x27;s nose by cutting back the chines to accommodate the huge Hughes AN/ASG-18 fire-control radar originally developed for the XF-108 with two infrared search and track sensors located in the chine leading edge, and the addition of the second cockpit for a crew member to operate the fire control radar for the air-to-air missile system. The modifications changed the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamics enough to require ventral fins to be mounted under the fuselage and engine nacelles to maintain stability. Three of the four bays previously used to house the A-12&#x27;s reconnaissance equipment were converted to carry Hughes AIM-47 Falcon (GAR-9) missiles. One bay was used for fire control equipment.
The first YF-12A flew on 7 August 1963. President Lyndon B. Johnson announced the existence of the aircraft on 24 February 1964. The YF-12A was announced in part to continue hiding the A-12, its still-secret ancestor; any sightings of CIA/Air Force A-12s based at Area 51 in Nevada could be attributed to the well-publicized Air Force YF-12As based at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The first public showing of the aircraft was on 30 September 1964 at Edwards.

On 14 May 1965, the Air Force placed a production order for 93 F-12Bs for its Air Defense Command (ADC). However, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara would not release the funding for three consecutive years due to Vietnam War costs. Updated intelligence placed a lower priority on defense of the continental US, so the F-12B was deemed no longer needed. Then in January 1968, the F-12B program was officially ended.

==Operational history==

===Air Force testing===
During flight tests the YF-12As set a speed record of and altitude record of , both on 1 May 1965, and demonstrated promising results with its unique weapon system. Six successful firings of the AIM-47 missiles were completed, and a seventh failed due to a gyro failure on one of the missiles. The last one was launched from the YF-12 at Mach 3.2 at an altitude of to a JQB-47E target drone off the ground. The missile did not have a warhead but still managed to hit the B-47 directly and take a section off its tail. The Air Force considered it a success and ordered 96 aircraft and had an initial budget of $90 million to further testing, but this was withheld by Secretary of Defense McNamara, who on 23 November 1967 put it towards the much less successful F-106X program that nearly failed.

The successful AIM-47 Falcon missile was increased in size and performance and became the AIM-54 Phoenix missile for the F-14 Tomcat. The AN/ASG 18 radar was upgraded to become the AN/AWG-9 and APG-71, which added the ability to track multiple targets.

One of the Air Force test pilots, Jim Irwin, would go on to become a NASA astronaut and walk on the Moon.

The program was abandoned following the cancellation of the production F-12B, but the YF-12s continued flying for many years with the USAF and with NASA as research aircraft.

===NASA testing===

The initial phase of the test program included objectives aimed at answering some questions about implementation of the B-1. Air Force objectives included exploration of its use in a tactical environment, and how airborne early warning and control (AWACS) would control supersonic aircraft. The Air Force portion was budgeted at US$4 million. The NASA tests would answer questions such as how engine inlet performance affected airframe and propulsion interaction, boundary layer noise, heat transfer under high Mach conditions, and altitude hold at supersonic speeds. The NASA budget for the 2.5-year program was US$14 million (~$ in ).

The YF-12 and SR-71 originally suffered from severe control issues that affected both the engines and the physical control of the aircraft. Wind testing at NASA Dryden and YF-12 research flights developed computer systems that nearly completely solved the performance issues. Testing revealed vortices from the nose chines interfering with intake air, which led to the development of a computer control system to open the forward bypass doors. A computer system to reduce unstarts was also developed. They also developed a flight engineering computer program called Central Airborne Performance Analyzer (CAPA) that relayed engine data to the pilots and informed them of any faults or issues with performance and indicated the severity of malfunctions.

Another system called Cooperative Airframe-Propulsion Control System (CAPCS) greatly improved the control of supersonic aircraft in flight. At such high speeds even minor changes in direction caused the aircraft to change position by thousands of feet, and often had severe temperature and pressure changes. CAPCS reduced these deviations by a factor of 10. The overall improvements increased range of the SR-71 by 7 percent.

Of the three YF-12As, AF Ser. No. 60-6934 was damaged beyond repair by fire at Edwards AFB during a landing mishap on 14 August 1966; its rear half was salvaged and combined with the front half of a Lockheed static test airframe to create the only SR-71C.

YF-12A, AF Ser. No. 60-6936 was lost on 24 June 1971 due to an in-flight fire caused by a failed fuel line; both pilots ejected safely just north of Edwards AFB. YF-12A, AF Ser. No. 60-6935 is the only surviving YF-12A; it was recalled from storage in 1969 for a joint USAF/NASA investigation of supersonic cruise technology, and then flown to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio on 17 November 1979.
A fourth YF-12 aircraft, the &quot;YF-12C&quot;, was actually the second SR-71A (AF Ser. No. 61–7951). This SR-71A was re-designated as a YF-12C and given the fictitious Air Force Serial Number 60-6937 from an A-12 to maintain SR-71 secrecy. The aircraft was loaned to NASA for propulsion testing after the loss of YF-12A (AF Ser. No. 60–6936) in 1971. The YF-12C was operated by NASA until September 1978, when it was returned to the Air Force.

The YF-12 had a real-field sonic-boom overpressure value between 33.5 and 52.7 N/m2 (0.7 to 1.1 lb/ft2) – below 48 was considered &quot;low&quot;.

==Variants==
;YF-12A: Pre-production version. Three were built.
;F-12B: Production version of the YF-12A with various improvements such as an increased combat radius from 1,200 to 1,350 nautical miles and an improved fire control system with increased bomber detection range from 100 to 125 miles; canceled before production could begin.
;YF-12C: Fictitious designation for an SR-71 provided to NASA for flight testing. The YF-12 designation was used to keep SR-71 information out of the public domain. From 1971 to 1978, 61-7951 was temporarily loaned to NASA from the Air Force as &quot;YF-12C #06937&quot;.

<text>Silpakorn University (SU.) (; ) is a national university in Thailand. The university was founded in Bangkok in 1943 by Tuscan–born art professor Corrado Feroci, who took the Thai name Silpa Bhirasri when he became a Thai citizen. It began as a fine arts university and now includes many other faculties as well. In 2016, it has 25,210 students.

== History ==
Silpakorn University was originally established as the School of Fine Arts under Thailand&#x27;s Fine Arts Department in 1933. The school offered the only painting and sculpture programs and waived tuition fees for government officials and students. Its creation owes much to the almost lifetime devotion of Professor Silpa Bhirasri, an Italian sculptor (formerly Corrado Feroci) who was commissioned during the reign of King Rama VI to work in the Fine Arts Department. He subsequently enlarged his classes to include greater members of the interested public before setting up the School of Fine Arts. The school gradually developed and was officially accorded a new status and named Silpakorn University on 12 October 1943. Its inaugural faculty was the Faculty of Painting and Sculpture. In 1955, the Faculty of Thai Architecture was established, later named the Faculty of Architecture) and two more faculties were created, the Faculty of Archaeology and the Faculty of Decorative Arts.

In 1966, Silpakorn University diversified the four faculties into sub–specializations to broaden its offerings, but the university&#x27;s Wang Tha Phra campus proved inadequate. A new campus, Sanam Chandra Palace, was established in Nakhon Pathom Province in the former residential compound of King Rama VI. The first two faculties based on this campus were the Faculty of Arts in 1968 and the Faculty of Education in 1970. Later, three more faculties were created: the Faculty of Science in 1972, the Faculty of Pharmacy in 1986, and the Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Technology in 1992. In 1999, the Faculty of Music was created.

In 1997, Silpakorn extended its reach by establishing a new campus in Phetchaburi Province. The new campus was named &quot;Phetchaburi Information Technology Campus&quot;. In 2001 and 2002, the Faculty of Animal Sciences and Agricultural Technology and the Faculty of Management Science were established on the Phetchaburi Campus. In 2003, the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was established, as well as Silpakorn University International College (SUIC). Its role is to provide an international curriculum in additional fields of study.

Ganesha, one of the Hindu deities symbolizing arts and crafts, is Silpakorn University&#x27;s emblem. The &quot;university tree&quot; is the chan tree.

== Campuses ==
=== Tha Phra Palace ===
Tha Phra Palace was Silpakorn&#x27;s first campus. It occupies a small part of the inner city of Bangkok known as Rattanakosin Island. Opposite the Grand Palace and covering an area of 8 rai, the campus was once the palace of Prince Narisara Nuwattiwong. On its west side is the Chao Phraya River. The office of the university president is in Taling Chan District, Bangkok.

=== Sanam Chandra Palace Campus ===
Sanam Chandra Palace Campus is on the grounds of Sanam Chandra Palace in Nakhon Pathom which was once the royal pavilion of King Rama VI of Chakri dynasty. It occupies 440 rai.

<doc id="547808" wikidata="Q7974703" url="?curid=547808" title="Watkins Glen State Park">
<text>Watkins Glen State Park is in the village of Watkins Glen, south of Seneca Lake in Schuyler County in New York&#x27;s Finger Lakes region. The park&#x27;s lower part is near the village, while the upper part is open woodland. It was opened to the public in 1863 and was privately run as a tourist resort until 1906, when it was purchased by New York State. Initially known as Watkins Glen State Reservation, the park was first managed by the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society before being turned over to full state control in 1911. Since 1924, it has been managed by the Finger Lakes Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

The centerpiece of the park is a narrow gorge cut through rock by Glen Creek, a stream that was left hanging when glaciers of the Ice age deepened the Seneca valley, increasing the tributary stream gradient to create rapids and waterfalls wherever there were layers of hard rock. The area&#x27;s rocks are sedimentary of Devonian age, part of a dissected plateau that was uplifted with little faulting or distortion. They consist mostly of soft shales, with some layers of harder sandstone and limestone.

The park features three trails, open from mid-May to early November, by which one can climb or descend the gorge. The Southern Rim and Indian Trails run along the gorge&#x27;s wooded rim, while the Gorge Trail is closest to the stream and runs over, under and along the park&#x27;s 19 waterfalls by way of stone bridges and more than 800 stone steps. The trails connect to the Finger Lakes Trail, an system of trails within New York state.

==Activities and services==

The park has comfortable camping sites, as well as picnic tables and pavilions, food, playground, a gift shop, pool, dump stations, showers, recreation programs, tent and trailer sites, fishing, hiking, hunting and cross-country skiing. The daily entrance fee is $10 per car. The park is open year-round, but not all facilities are available at all times. The Gorge trail is closed between around mid-October through late May due to winter conditions and ice on the trail while the other trails remain open.

==Geology==

During the Pleistocene era, a vast area was covered by ice during the maximum extent of glacial ice in the north polar area. The movement of glaciers from the Laurentide and Wisconsin ice sheets shaped the Finger Lakes region. The lakes originated as a series of northward-flowing streams. Around two million years ago the first of many continental glaciers of the Laurentide Ice Sheet moved southward from the Hudson Bay area, initiating the Pleistocene glaciation. These glaciers widened, deepened and accentuated the existing river valleys. Glacial debris, possibly including terminal moraines, left behind by the receding ice acted as dams, allowing lakes to form. Despite the deep erosion of the valleys, the surrounding uplands show little evidence of glaciation, suggesting that the ice was thin, or at least unable to cause much erosion at these higher altitudes. The deep cutting of the valleys by the ice left some tributaries hanging high above the lakes: both Seneca and Cayuga have tributaries hanging as much as above the valley floors.

One such hanging valley, overlooking the south end of the Seneca Lake valley, evolved into the deep gorge of Watkins Glen. The steep drop of Glen Creek into Seneca Valley created a powerful torrent that eroded the underlying rock, cutting further and further back towards the stream&#x27;s headwaters. This erosion was not a uniform process: the rock here includes shale, limestone, and sandstone, and these types of rock erode at different rates, leaving behind a staircase of waterfalls, cascades, plunge pools, and potholes. Watkins Glen State Park now encompasses nineteen waterfalls spaced along a trail roughly long.

<doc id="547810" wikidata="Q5645483" url="?curid=547810" title="Hamlin Beach State Park">
<text>Hamlin Beach State Park is a state park located on the shore of Lake Ontario in the Town of Hamlin in Monroe County, New York, United States. The Lake Ontario State Parkway passes through the park.

==History==
Hamlin Beach first became a park in 1929, after Monroe County purchased a total of for $169,373. The park, initially known as Northwest Beach Park, consisted of the former Charles Wolf property and surrounding farmland. The park&#x27;s name was changed to Hamlin Beach Park in 1930.

While under county ownership, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was constructed at the park, and workers lodged at the camp labored to improve the park&#x27;s facilities between 1935 and 1941. During World War II, the site was used as a Prisoner of War camp, housing German POWs between 1944 and 1946. The camp served as a labor hub, providing workers to local farms and food processing plants in the Hamlin area. The camp was dismantled when the war was over.

The site was transferred to New York State&#x27;s ownership in 1938, and was renamed Hamlin Beach State Park. After World War II, the Lake Ontario State Parkway was extended through the park, increasing accessibility. The parking lot was expanded to handle the increase in visitors, and the campgrounds were built.

Evidence of the Civilian Conservation Corps&#x27; park improvements can be seen, including stone-work on headwalls, barriers and pavilions. Their work on the park was responsible for six buildings and the reclamation of swampland on the eastern end.

During the 1970s, the park, specifically the beach, was suffering from large amounts of erosion from storms. State and Federal funding was provided and the beaches were rebuilt and jetties were added to help prevent further damage. Development on the Yanty Creek Nature trail began as well. It is now a mile-long trail with educational markers along the way.

In 2008, volunteers from the Friends of Hamlin Beach began clearing brush from the grounds of the former CCC/POW camp which is located off of Moscow Road in Hamlin. An interpretive trail explaining the history of the camp was officially opened in 2014.

==Park description==
Hamlin Beach State Park offers a beach, picnic tables with pavilions, a playground, recreation programs, a nature trail, surfing, hiking and biking, fishing, a campground with 264 tent and trailer sites, ice skating, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, a boat launch, and a food concession.

The park is open year-round, and swimming is permitted from the middle of June through Labor Day. Campsites are available from early May through Columbus day. The beach occasionally closes due to pollution.

Three parking lots, with the capacity to hold 2,500 vehicles, are available along the main road through the park. A $9 parking fee is assessed for vehicles (Deducted to $3 for the 2019 season). The park is handicap accessible. Pets are permitted on leashes of or less, and must have proof of inoculation before entering the camping area. No animals are allowed on the beach.

Boats may be launched from either a designated hand launch north of the Area 1 parking lot or from a car-top launch on the eastern end of the beach near the Yantee Creek parking area.

In 2016, it was announced that Governor Cuomo was giving Hamlin Beach State Park $2.25 Million for a park enhancement program. With this money, the old 1939 sandstone bathhouse, built by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps, underwent heavy remodeling. They were gutted, and improved. Also, new bathrooms were installed in loops A &amp; B in the campground area.

===Trails===

The Yanty Creek Nature Trail is on the eastern end of the park and the trailhead is accessible by the park road. There is parking for about 10 cars at the trailhead. The trail is stone or mulch and winds around in a loop. Informational placards are provided along the way. The Shoreline Trail is a paved trail that runs along the lake east to west, passing by the beaches. There are several other small trails within the campgrounds and other wooded areas.

The Devil&#x27;s Nose is a sand bluff on the westernmost end of the park. The tree-covered bluff is part of a larger sand and clay shoal that extends approximately under the lake. The above-water section of the Nose used to be much larger, but rising lake levels and erosion has drastically reduced the size. In 2018, work began to re-open the trails to the public. Mulch was laid down, fences placed, and the trails were re-opened in 2019 for public access. Stay back signs posted frequently because of nearly 80 foot drop.

Devil&#x27;s Nose is the site of many shipwrecks, including the York in December 1799; the C. Reeve on November 22, 1862; the Almira on June 8, 1863; and the John Weeden on October 27, 1869.

<doc id="547811" wikidata="Q61015" url="?curid=547811" title="Prince Leopold of Bavaria">
<text>Prince Leopold of Bavaria (Leopold Maximilian Joseph Maria Arnulf; 9 February 1846 – 28 September 1930) was born in Munich, the second son of Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria (1821–1912) and his wife Archduchess Augusta of Austria (1825–1864). He was a Field Marshal (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;) who commanded German and Austro-Hungarian forces on the Eastern Front in World War I.

==Biography==

=== Military career ===
Prince Leopold entered the Bavarian Army at the age of 15, and received his patent as a lieutenant dated 28 November 1861. He saw first combat during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, where he commanded an artillery battery at Kissingen and Rossbrunn.

In 1870, King Ludwig II of Bavaria sent Leopold to the battlefields of France, where the Bavarian Army was fighting alongside the Prussian Army in the Franco-Prussian War. He served with the 3rd Bavarian Artillery Regiment and saw action at Sedan and Beauvert. He was promoted to major in December 1870. For his bravery against the enemy he received both the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Classes, the Bavarian Military Merit Order Knight 1st Class, the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph, Bavaria&#x27;s highest military decoration, and decorations from several other German states.

In the post-war years, Prince Leopold spent most of his time travelling, visiting Africa, Asia and countries of Europe. He was married on 20 April 1873 at Vienna to his second cousin Archduchess Gisela of Austria, daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and the Empress Elisabeth. From 1881 to 1887 Leopold was the commander of the 1st Royal Bavarian Division, from 1887 to 1892 of the I Royal Bavarian Corps. In both commands he would be succeeded by his younger brother, Prince Arnulf of Bavaria. In 1892 Leopold became the inspector general of the 4th Army Inspection, replacing Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal. After his appointment, the 4th Army Inspection gradually became consistent of Bavarian corps. He remained in the Bavarian Army and was finally promoted to the rank of field marshal (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;) on 1 January 1905. In 1911 he ordered a 6m racing yacht &quot;Ralle II&quot; from the great British yacht designer Alfred Mylne, built at the Rambeck yard on Lake Starnberg. He retired from active duty in 1913 to give chances to Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria.

=== First World War ===
Prince Leopold&#x27;s retirement, however, did not last long. On 16 April 1915, he was given command of the German 9th Army, replacing General August von Mackensen. Leopold quickly proved himself an able commander as he took Warsaw on 4 August 1915. Following this success, he was put in command of Army Group Prince Leopold of Bavaria (&quot;Heeresgruppe Prinz Leopold von Bayern&quot;), which was a German force in the central/northern sector of the Eastern Front. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph on 5 August 1915, the prestigious &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, Prussia&#x27;s highest military decoration, on 9 August 1915 and the oak leaves to the Pour le Mérite on 25 July 1917.

On 29 August 1916, after the brutal summer campaigns succeeded in reversing the Brusilov Offensive against the Austrians, Leopold became the Supreme Commander of the German forces on the Eastern front (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber Ost&quot;), succeeding Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Leopold held this post for the rest of the war. Because of his position, Leopold was a potential German candidate for the throne of the puppet Kingdom of Poland.

On 4 March 1918, Leopold received yet another high honor, the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, awarded only five times during World War I.

Prince Leopold retired again in 1918 after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which had ended the war on the Eastern Front. This treaty was highly favorable to Germany, and Leopold ended his career with success. He died on 28 September 1930 in Munich and is buried in the Colombarium in the Michaelskirche in Munich.

<text>Devil&#x27;s Hole State Park is a state park located in Niagara County, New York, north of the City of Niagara Falls. The day-use park overlooks the lower Niagara River Gorge.

==History==
Devil&#x27;s Hole State Park occupies a location that was historically an important portage used by Native Americans to transport canoes around Niagara Falls and rapids on the Niagara River. It was the location of an early battle between European settlers and Native Americans over control of the portage route.

The park was opened in 1924, and is one of the oldest state parks in the region, although it was preceded by Niagara Falls State Park.

==Description==
Devil&#x27;s Hole State Park is a day-use park that allows fishing, hiking, picnic tables, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. A popular trail descends into the Niagara River Gorge to allow close access to the rapids below, however off-trail hiking is prohibited due to dangerous conditions.

The park is connected with nearby Whirlpool State Park via the Devil&#x27;s Hole Trail at the gorge&#x27;s bottom, as well as a trail along the gorge&#x27;s rim, which together form a complete loop.

<text>Les Barker (30 January 1947 – 14 January 2023) was an English poet. He wrote comedic poetry, parodies of popular songs, and also serious works.

== Biography ==

Barker was born in Manchester, England, on 30 January 1947. He studied accountancy before he realised that he had a talent for writing. At the beginning of his career he toured around folk music venues as a solo performer, and later with The Mrs Ackroyd Band (named after his mongrel dog Mrs Ackroyd.) Barker was not a singer and the Mrs Ackroyd Band, with classically trained vocalists Hilary Spencer and Alison Younger, and keyboard player Chris Harvey, enabled his parodies to be sung live. He toured around Britain and such countries as Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.

Barker authored 77 books and released 20 albums. His books contain a mixture of monologues, comic songs, and serious songs. The monologues tip the hat to Marriott Edgar. Like Edgar, Barker has created several recurring characters and themes such as &#x27;Jason and the Arguments&#x27;, &#x27;Cosmo the Fairly Accurate Knife Thrower&#x27;, &#x27;Captain Indecisive&#x27;, &#x27;The Far off Land of Dyslexia&#x27; and &#x27;Spot of the Antarctic&#x27;, which have become trademarks of Barker&#x27;s work. Both his comic and serious songs have become standards for other singers such as Waterson–Carthy and June Tabor.

Barker was also one of the few writers (alongside Stephen Sondheim, with his parody &quot;The Boy From...&quot;) to get the Welsh place named Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantisiliogogogoch into a song successfully (it forms the main chorus of a song of the same name, and is sung four times). In the mid 2000s, Barker moved to Bwlchgwyn in Wrexham, Wales, and learnt Welsh, producing two books of poetry written in the Welsh tongue.

In 2008 he was awarded the NIACE Inspire Award as Welsh Learner of the Year, and recited his poem &quot;Have you Got Any News of the Iceberg?&quot; in Welsh at the presentation in Swansea.

In 2009, a campaign by his folk fanbase sought to have him chosen as the British Poet Laureate.

After a heart attack in January 2008, Barker began solo gigging again. Barker remained firmly rooted in the circuit of folk clubs and festivals. He has also performed as part of a double act with Keith Donnelly under the name &quot;Idiot and Friend&quot;.

After being diagnosed with cancer and undergoing chemotherapy, he announced his retirement from touring in October 2022, but intended to maintain his online presence via YouTube. 

On 14 January 2023, Barker attended a match of The New Saints F.C. at Park Hall in Oswestry, Shropshire. Afterward, he returned to his car and died from an apparent heart attack at the age of 75. His body was found in his car by maintenance staff the following morning.

===&quot;Guide Cats for the Blind&quot;===
Barker also wrote a poem called &quot;Guide Cats for the Blind&quot; which later became the title track of a double fundraising CD for the British Computer Association of the Blind (BCAB). The Association runs a program called EyeT4all, which aims to make computers accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired. Barker also agreed to the recording of a series of albums. Over £40,000 has been raised.

Five &quot;Guide Cats&quot; albums have been produced, &quot;Guide Cats for the Blind&quot;, &quot;Missing Persians File&quot;, &quot;Top Cat, White Tie and Tails&quot;, &quot;Cat Nav&quot; and &quot;Herding Cats&quot;. The CDs contain performances of Barker&#x27;s poems by members of the folk world such as June Tabor, Martin Carthy, Steve Tilston, Mike Harding and Tom Paxton and well known figures including Jimmy Young, Nicholas Parsons, Brian Perkins, Terry Wogan, Nicky Campbell, Robert Lindsay, Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs.

<text>The Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University (branded as Northwestern Kellogg) is the graduate business school of Northwestern University, a private research university in Evanston, Illinois. Kellogg is part of the M7, an informal network of business schools recognized as having elite MBA programs, regarded as among the most prestigious in the United States. 

==History==

=== Early history (1908–1950) ===
The school was founded in 1908 as Northwestern University&#x27;s School of Commerce. It offered a part-time evening program. It was a founding member of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, that sets accreditation standards for business schools. The school played a major role in helping to establish the Graduate Management Admission Test. Also, researchers associated with the school have made contributions to fields such as marketing and decision sciences. For instance, Walter Dill Scott, a pioneer in applied psychology, helped establish some of the earliest advertising and marketing courses in the first decade of the twentieth century. He went on to serve as president of Northwestern University from 1920 to 1939. More recently, Philip Kotler and Sidney J. Levy&#x27;s groundbreaking 1969 Journal of Marketing article, &quot;Broadening the Conception of Marketing,&quot; laid the foundations for a greatly expanded understanding of marketing. Similarly, Kotler&#x27;s Marketing Management text has played a key role in deepening the field&#x27;s scholarship.

In 1919, Ralph E. Heilman, a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.

=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951–1978) ===
In 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program&#x27;s success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in Bürgenstock, Switzerland. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school&#x27;s history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975–2001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably James L. Allen, a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton. The Allen Center&#x27;s cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.

In 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors – rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.

These dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965–1975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the &quot;School of Business&quot;) to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school&#x27;s Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor Stanley Reiter.

=== Continued expansion: John L. Kellogg (1979–2008) ===
In 1979, in honor of a $10 million gift made to the school on behalf of John L. Kellogg, son of W.K. Kellogg, the school was renamed as the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management&quot;.&quot; The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory. Even before the Kellogg gift, the school had been expanding its research-focused faculty: In 1978 alone, the school added six additional &quot;named&quot; professorships and two new research professorships.

In 2001, its name was shortened to the Kellogg School of Management.

=== Recent history (2009–today) ===
In June 2009, Kellogg announced that Dipak C. Jain would step down after eight years as dean and return to teaching. On September 1, 2009, Sunil Chopra, former Senior Associate Dean for Curriculum and Teaching and the IBM Distinguished Professor of Operations Management, assumed the role of interim dean while a search committee worked to find a permanent replacement. Later in 2009, Northwestern University announced plans to construct a new building at the northeast corner of its Evanston campus to serve as Kellogg&#x27;s new home. The new facility, called the Global Hub, opened in March 2017 adjacent to Lake Michigan and includes classrooms, faculty offices, collaborative learning spaces, and administrative offices.

In March 2010, Kellogg announced that Sally Blount would replace Sunil Chopra as dean, starting in July. Blount was the dean of the undergraduate college, and vice dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University. Dean Blount launched ambitious marketing and capital campaigns. These started in 2011 with the Think Bravely campaign, and subsequently announced a new Inspiring Growth campaign in 2014. This campaign is focused on the dual meaning of creating economic value while increasing self-knowledge and insight.

On February 6, 2012, Blount unveiled a seven-year plan, Envision Kellogg, aimed at restructuring the business school and launching Kellogg to the top of global rankings. As of 2018, $365 million dollars of the campaign target of 350 million dollars have been raised. On July 12, 2018, Kathleen Hagerty was named interim dean while Kellogg searched for a new dean. In February 2019, Kellogg announced that Francesca Cornelli would succeed Hagerty as dean.

==Campuses==
The Kellogg School&#x27;s full-time and Executive MBA facilities are situated along the shores of Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois, on Chicago&#x27;s North Shore, while the school&#x27;s evening and weekend MBA program is housed on Northwestern&#x27;s Downtown Chicago campus in Wieboldt Hall, between the law and medical schools. The downtown campus is also on Lake Michigan to the east and close to Michigan Avenue to the west. In January 2006, Kellogg opened a new campus for its EMBA program for Latin American executives in Miami.

Students in the Kellogg full-time program take the majority of their classes at the Global Hub, which opened on March 28, 2017. This 415,000 square-foot building is located on the shores of Lake Michigan. Toronto-based Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects designed this building. The Global Hub is built-out in four directions surrounding two atriums and numerous other commons areas. The building includes a design lab with 3D-printing equipment and an art studio.
== Academics ==

=== Admissions ===
Kellogg was the first business school in the world to insist that all applicants be interviewed to assess their leadership potential and suitability for the Kellogg School&#x27;s cooperative environment. As a result, in addition to grades, GMAT scores, professional achievement, and demonstrated leadership, &#x27;fit&#x27; is an important part of the admissions equation at Kellogg.

===Programs===
Kellogg offers full-time MBA, Executive MBA, MMM (MBA + MSDI), JD-MBA, MBAi, MD-MBA, evening and weekend MBA, Master of Science in Management Studies programs, course offerings for programs such as MEM as well as Ph.D. programs in several fields, and non-degree executive education programs.

====Full-time MBA====
The regular MBA program at Kellogg requires two years to complete. Kellogg accepts the Graduate Record Examination in addition to the GMAT from applicants. Students may choose from seven majors including accounting, economics, finance, marketing, operations, strategy, and managing organizations. If a student does not elect a major &quot;General Management&quot; will appear on their transcript. In addition to majors, Kellogg offers &quot;pathways&quot; to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital &amp; private equity.

====One-year MBA====
Kellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include Robert Eckert &#x27;77, former chairman and CEO, Mattel; Richard Lenny &#x27;77, former chairman and CEO, the Hershey Company; and Thomas J. Wilson &#x27;80, chairman and CEO, Allstate. With the exception of the two-year MBA at London Business School, European MBA&#x27;s are one year, as at INSEAD in France, IMD in Switzerland, IE Business School in Madrid and Oxford&#x27;s Saïd Business School.

MBAi 

The MBA, Artificial Intelligence (MBAi) Program is a 15-month (5-Quarter) joint degree program between the Kellogg School of Management and the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. Students earn an MBA degree from Kellogg School of Management by the end of the program.

====MMM====
Graduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the Segal Design Institute at the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. This seven-quarter program begins in the summer before the traditional fall start of a two-year program.

====JD-MBA====
In cooperation with the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, Kellogg offers a program that leads to earning a JD and an MBA in just three years. Students spend their first year in law school where they study the standard curriculum. During the first summer and second-year, students study entirely at Kellogg. The second summer students choose to devote their time to either law or business entirely. During the final year, most classes are spent at the law school, but students may take some electives at the business school.

====Evening and weekend MBA====
Kellogg offers an Evening &amp; Weekend MBA (E&amp;W MBA) program aimed towards students who continue to develop their careers as they pursue their MBA degree. Within the E&amp;W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&amp;W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening &amp; weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.

====Executive MBA====
Kellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.

==== Ph.D. programs ====
Kellogg awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in 1927. Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.

====Overseas exchange programs====

*School of Business and Management at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong
*Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel
*WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management in Germany
*Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto, Canada
*Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in Beijing, China

=== Student profile ===

==Rankings==
In the most recent rankings of U.S. business schools, Kellogg is ranked 3rd by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, In addition, Kellogg MBA has consistently been ranked 1st in Marketing by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Three of the Kellogg School&#x27;s other executive MBA programs are also ranked 5th by the &quot;Financial Times in 2022&quot;. The Kellogg-HKUST Executive MBA Program at the Hong Kong UST Business School is ranked No. 2 in the world, the school&#x27;s Kellogg-Schulich Executive MBA program at York University in Canada is ranked No. 33 in the world, while the school&#x27;s Kellogg-WHU Executive MBA program at WHU Business School in Germany is ranked No. 22 in the world.

The Kellogg-HKUST Executive MBA Program consistently ranks in the No. 1 position; EMBA was ranked No. 1 in Canada by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

==Student life==
Students tend to be very active in impacting the local Evanston and Chicago communities, and frequently collaborate on philanthropic causes. One example combining the campus culture and passion for giving is the annual Charity Auction Ball, held each winter quarter.

Unlike many peer schools, Kellogg does disclose grades to recruiters. The issue of grade disclosure was last voted on by students in 2005, and a process exists whereby Kellogg students can vote to change the policy.

==Notable people==
=== Alumni ===
Kellogg has an alumni network of over 67,000 graduates working in nearly every industry and endeavor. Alumni can participate in over 60 active regional alumni clubs and more than 20 special interest clubs. The Kellogg Alumni Council helps strengthen connections among alumni. In 2022, there were active KAC members in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

Current Kellogg students are encouraged to interact with alumni on a number of levels. Most recently, the evening &amp; weekend MBA program introduced the Kellogg Alumni Mentorship Program (KAMP). KAMP asks current students and alumni to fill out a short survey and then matches mentors and mentees by areas of interest. Alumni Clubs like The Kellogg Alumni Club of Chicago provide alumni with the opportunity to enrich their connections, careers, and lives through an ongoing array of social, professional development and networking events that are offered exclusively to Kellogg alumni living in the Chicago area.

<doc id="547826" wikidata="Q598540" url="?curid=547826" title="Homosexual behavior in animals">
<text>Various non-human animal species exhibit behavior that can be interpreted as homosexual or bisexual, often referred to as &quot;same-sex sexual behavior&quot; (SSSB) by scientists. This may include same-sex sexual activity, courtship, affection, pair bonding, and parenting among same-sex animal pairs. Various forms of this are found among a variety of vertebrate and arthropod taxonomic classes. The sexual behavior of non-human animals takes many different forms, even within the same species, though homosexual behavior is best known from social species.

Scientists observe same-sex sexual behavior in animals in different degrees and forms among different species and clades. A 2019 paper states that it has been observed in over 1,500 species. Although same-sex interactions involving genital contact have been reported in many animal species, they are routinely manifested in only a few, including humans. Other than humans, the only known species to exhibit exclusive homosexual orientation is the domesticated sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;), involving about 10% of males. The motivations for and implications of these behaviors are often lensed through anthropocentric thinking; Bruce Bagemihl states that any hypothesis is &quot;necessarily an account of human interpretations of these phenomena&quot;.

Proposed causes for same-sex sexual behavior vary across species. Theories include mistaken identity (especially for arthropods), sexually antagonistic selection, balancing selection, practice of behaviors needed for reproduction, expression of social dominance or submission, and social bonding. Genetic, hormonal, and neurological variations as a basis for individual behavioral differences within species have been proposed, and same-sex sexual behavior has been induced in laboratory animals by these means.

==In relation to humans==


===Applying the term &quot;homosexual&quot; to animals===
The term &quot;homosexual&quot; was coined by the Hungarian writer and campaigner Karl Maria Kertbeny in 1868 to describe same-sex sexual attraction and sexual behavior in humans. Its use in animal studies has been controversial for two main reasons: animal sexuality and motivating factors have been and remain poorly understood, and the term has strong cultural implications in western society that are irrelevant for species other than humans. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. According to Bagemihl, when describing animals, the term &quot;homosexual&quot; is preferred over &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot;, and other terms currently in use, as these are seen as even more bound to human homosexuality.

Bailey et al. says:Homosexual: in animals, this has been used to refer to same-sex behavior that is not sexual in character (e.g. &#x27;homosexual tandem running&#x27; in termites), same-sex courtship or copulatory behavior occurring over a short period of time (e.g. &#x27;homosexual mounting&#x27; in cockroaches and rams) or long-term pair bonds between same-sex partners that might involve any combination of courting, copulating, parenting and affectional behaviors (e.g. &#x27;homosexual pair bonds&#x27; in gulls). In humans, the term is used to describe individual sexual behaviors as well as long-term relationships, but in some usages connotes a gay or lesbian social identity. Scientific writing would benefit from reserving this anthropomorphic term for humans and not using it to describe behavior in other animals, because of its deeply rooted context in human society.Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. In wild animals, researchers will not be able to map the entire life of an individual, and must infer from frequency of single observations of behavior. The correct usage of the term &quot;homosexual&quot; is that an animal &quot;exhibits homosexual behavior&quot; or even &quot;same-sex sexual behavior&quot;; however, this article conforms to the usage by modern research, applying the term &quot;homosexuality&quot; to all sexual behavior (copulation, genital stimulation, mating games and sexual display behavior) between animals of the same sex. In most instances, it is presumed that the homosexual behavior is but part of the animal&#x27;s overall sexual behavioral repertoire, making the animal &quot;bisexual&quot; rather than &quot;homosexual&quot; as the terms are commonly understood in humans.

===Nature===
The observation of homosexual behavior in animals can be seen as both an argument for and against the acceptance of homosexuality in humans, and has been used especially against the claim that it is a &quot;peccatum contra naturam&quot; (&quot;sin against nature&quot;). For instance, homosexuality in animals was cited by the American Psychological Association and other groups in their &quot;amici curiae&quot; brief to the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which ultimately struck down the sodomy laws of 14 states.

==Research==
A majority of the research available concerning homosexual behavior in animals lacks specification between animals that exclusively exhibit same-sex tendencies and those that participate in heterosexual and homosexual mating activities interchangeably. This lack of distinction has led to differing opinions and conflicting interpretations of collected data amongst scientists and researchers. For instance, Bruce Bagemihl, author of the book &quot;Biological Exuberence: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity&quot;, emphasizes that there are no anatomical or endocrinological differences between exclusively homosexual and exclusively heterosexual animal pairs. However, if the definition of &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; is made to include animals that participate in both same-sex and opposite-sex mating activities, hormonal differences have been documented among key sex hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, when compared to those who participate solely in heterosexual mating.

Many of the animals used in laboratory-based studies of homosexuality do not appear to spontaneously exhibit these tendencies often in the wild. Such behavior is often elicited and exaggerated by the researcher during experimentation through the destruction of a portion of brain tissue, or by exposing the animal to high levels of steroid hormones prenatally. Information gathered from these studies is limited when applied to spontaneously occurring same-sex behavior in animals outside of the laboratory.

Homosexual behaviour in animals has been discussed since classical antiquity. The earliest written mention of animal homosexuality appears to date back to 2,300 years ago, when Aristotle (384–322 BC) described copulation between pigeons, partridges and quails of the same sex. The Hieroglyphics of Horapollo, written in the 4th century AD by the Egyptian writer Horapollo, mentions &quot;hermaphroditism&quot; in hyenas and homosexuality in partridges. The first review of animal homosexuality was written by the zoologist Ferdinand Karsch-Haack in 1900.

Academic research into the ubiquity of same-sex sexual behavior was not carried out on a large scale, possibly due to observer bias caused by social attitudes to same-sex sexual behavior, innocent confusion, lack of interest, distaste, scientists fearing loss of their grants or even from a fear of &quot;being ridiculed by their colleagues&quot;. Georgetown University biologist Janet Mann states &quot;Scientists who study the topic are often accused of trying to forward an agenda, and their work can come under greater scrutiny than that of their colleagues who study other topics.&quot; They also noted &quot;Not every sexual act has a reproductive function ... that&#x27;s true of humans and non-humans.&quot; Studies have demonstrated homosexual behavior in a number of species, but the true extent of homosexuality in animals is not known.
Some researchers believe this behavior to have its origin in male social organization and social dominance, similar to the dominance traits shown in prison sexuality. Others, particularly Bagemihl, Joan Roughgarden, Thierry Lodé and Paul Vasey suggest the social function of sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) is not necessarily connected to dominance, but serves to strengthen alliances and social ties within a flock. While reports on many such mating scenarios are still only anecdotal, a growing body of scientific work confirms that permanent homosexuality occurs not only in species with permanent pair bonds, but also in non-monogamous species like sheep. One report on sheep found that 8% of rams exhibited homosexual preferences—that is, even when given a choice, they chose male over female partners. In fact, apparent homosexual individuals are known from all of the traditional domestic species, from sheep, cattle and horses to cats, dogs and budgerigars. In October 2023, biologists reported studies of animals (over 1,500 different species) that found same-sex behavior (not necessarily related to human orientation) may help improve social stability by reducing conflict within the groups studied.

==Basis==
Sexual behaviors often require a significant energy investment. When sexual behaviors produce offspring, there is an obvious benefit for the animal. However, the benefit from performing homosexual behaviors (which cannot result in the production of offspring) is less obvious, and some scientists have called it a &quot;Darwinian paradox&quot; because it is non-reproductive. A number of non-exclusive different explanations for the emergence of such traits have been put forward.

===Physiological basis===
A definite physiological explanation or reason for homosexual activity in animal species has not been agreed upon by researchers in the field. Numerous scholars are of the opinion that varying levels (either higher or lower) of the sex hormones in the animal, in addition to the size of the animal&#x27;s gonads, play a direct role in the sexual behavior and preference exhibited by that animal. Others firmly argue no evidence to support these claims exists when comparing animals of a specific species exhibiting homosexual behavior exclusively and those that do not. Ultimately, empirical support from comprehensive endocrinological studies exist for both interpretations. Researchers found no evidence of differences in the measurements of the gonads, or the levels of the sex hormones of exclusively homosexual western gulls and ring-billed gulls.

Additional studies pertaining to hormone involvement in homosexual behavior indicate that when administering treatments of testosterone and estradiol to female heterosexual animals, the elevated hormone levels increase the likelihood of homosexual behavior. Additionally, boosting the levels of sex hormones during an animal&#x27;s pregnancy appears to increase the likelihood of it birthing a homosexual offspring.

===Genetic basis===
Researchers found that disabling the fucose mutarotase (FucM) gene in laboratory mice – which influences the levels of estrogen to which the brain is exposed – caused the female mice to behave as if they were male as they grew up. &quot;The mutant female mouse underwent a slightly altered developmental programme in the brain to resemble the male brain in terms of sexual preference&quot; said professor Chankyu Park of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejon, South Korea, who led the research. His findings were published in the &quot;BMC Genetics&quot; journal on July 7, 2010. Another study found that by manipulating a gene in fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila&quot;), homosexual behavior appeared to have been induced. However, in addition to homosexual behavior, several abnormal behaviors were also exhibited apparently due to this mutation.

===Neurobiological basis===
In March 2011, research showed that serotonin is involved in the mechanism of sexual orientation of mice. A study conducted on fruit flies found that inhibiting the dopamine neurotransmitter inhibited lab-induced homosexual behavior.
=== Other hypotheses ===

One proposal for the adaptive function of homosexual behavior is the formation of alliances and mutual social benefit to the animals. Studies support this in specific species, such as black swans, where a quarter of mate pairs consist of two males, who mate with a female and chase her away once she lays the egg, then raise it themselves. These M-M pairs have great success in defending their territory and resources, and keep their young alive until fledgling 80% of the time, compared to 30% for M-F pairs.

Studies done on homosexual behavior in birds showed a negative correlation between relative parental investment and F-F homosexual behaviors, i.e. females that invested more time and care into their young relative to males had less homosexual encounters. Similarly, there was a negative correlation between relative parental investment and M-M homosexual behaviors. This meant that species exhibiting a high degree of polygamy (where females often are the exclusive caretakers of the young) F-F sexual behaviors were very rare, whereas in a socially monogamous species (in which a M-F pair works together to care for young) they were much more common. The trend was opposite for males, in polygamous species M-M sexual behaviors were quite common and in socially monogamous species they were rare. The study argues that release from parental care, a very energy intensive investment, allows the opportunities for homosexual behaviors to be exhibited, and higher parental care prevents homosexual behaviors from occurring because of the energy cost of the behaviors.

A 2019 paper hypothesized that when sex first began to evolve, there was no distinction between homosexuality and heterosexuality, and animals mated with other members of their species indiscriminately. This is a contrast to most perspectives, which try to find explanations for the evolution of homosexual behaviors and separate it completely from the evolution of heterosexual behaviors. The study states that it is unlikely that sexual behaviors evolved simultaneously to the evolution of traits necessary to recognize a compatible sexual mate, such as size, shape, odor, and color. As those secondary sex characteristics evolved, sexuality would have become more discriminatory, leading to less homosexuality, but homosexual behaviors would rarely have had enough cost to be selected against and removed entirely from a population. Additionally, the cost of homosexual behavior would be offset by the cost of mate recognition, which requires psychological adaptations, and excessive discrimination in mate choice can lead to missing out of mating opportunities. With indiscriminate mating, these factors are irrelevant. The paper notes that in some species, especially where survival is very difficult and each energy-related decision could mean the animal&#x27;s death, homosexual behavior would be strongly selected against, leading to strictly heterosexual species.

== Some select species and groups==
===Birds===
====Black swans====
An estimated one-quarter of all black swan pairings are of males. They steal nests, or form temporary threesomes with females to obtain eggs, driving away the female after she lays the eggs. The males spent time in each other&#x27;s society, guarded the common territory, performed greeting ceremonies before each other, and (in the reproductive period) pre-marital rituals, and if one of the birds tried to sit on the other, an intense fight began. More of their cygnets survive to adulthood than those of different-sex pairs, possibly due to their superior ability to defend large portions of land. The same reasoning has been applied to male flamingo pairs raising chicks.

====Albatrosses====
Female Laysan albatrosses, on the north-western tip of the island of Oahu, Hawaii, form pairs for co-growing offspring. On the observed island, the number of females considerably exceeds the number of males (59% N=102/172), so 31% of females, after mating with males, create partnerships for hatching and feeding chicks. Compared to male-female couples, female-female partnerships have a lower hatching rate (87% vs 41%) and lower overall reproductive success (67% vs 31%).

Warming waters from climate change have led to increased foraging times and thus increased mortality among female black-browed albatrosses on the Antipodes Islands in New Zealand. The skewed gender imbalance has led to many male albatrosses forming homosexual relationships. Male-male pairs now comprise between 2–5% of the albatross population on the islands.

==== Blue ducks ====
In 2009, a UK-based captive breeding program for blue ducks (involving two males and one female) was derailed when the two males paired with each other instead of with the female that they were assigned to mate with.

====Ibises====

Research has shown that the environmental pollutant methylmercury can increase the prevalence of homosexual behavior in male American white ibis. The study involved exposing chicks in varying dosages to the chemical and measuring the degree of homosexual behavior in adulthood. The results discovered was that as the dosage was increased the likelihood of homosexual behavior also increased. The endocrine blocking feature of mercury has been suggested as a possible cause of sexual disruption in other bird species.

====Mallards====

Mallards form male-female pairs only until the female lays eggs, at which time the male leaves the female. Mallards have rates of male-male sexual activity that are unusually high for birds, in some cases, as high as 19% of all pairs in a population. Kees Moeliker of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam has observed one male mallard engage in homosexual necrophilia.

====Penguins====

Penguins have been observed to engage in homosexual behaviour since at least as early as 1911. George Murray Levick, who documented this behaviour in Adélie penguins at Cape Adare, described it as &quot;depraved&quot;. The report was considered too shocking for public release at the time, and was suppressed. The only copies that were made available privately to researchers had the English text partly written in Greek letters, to prevent this knowledge becoming more widely known. The report was unearthed only a century later, and published in &quot;Polar Record&quot; in June 2012.

In early February 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Roy and Silo, a male pair of chinstrap penguins in the Central Park Zoo in New York City, had successfully hatched and fostered a female chick from a fertile egg they had been given to incubate. Other penguins in New York zoos have also been reported to have formed same-sex pairs.

In Odense Zoo in Denmark, a pair of male king penguins adopted an egg that had been abandoned by a female, proceeding to incubate it and raise the chick.
Zoos in Japan and Germany have also documented homosexual male penguin couples. The couples have been shown to build nests together and use a stone as a substitute for an egg. Researchers at Rikkyo University in Tokyo found 20 homosexual pairs at 16 major aquariums and zoos in Japan.

The Bremerhaven Zoo in Germany attempted to encourage reproduction of endangered Humboldt penguins by importing females from Sweden and separating three male pairs, but this was unsuccessful. The zoo&#x27;s director said that the relationships were &quot;too strong&quot; between the homosexual pairs. German gay groups protested at this attempt to break up the male-male pairs but the zoo&#x27;s director was reported as saying &quot;We don&#x27;t know whether the three male pairs are really homosexual or whether they have just bonded because of a shortage of females ... nobody here wants to forcibly separate homosexual couples.&quot;

A pair of male Magellanic penguins at the San Francisco Zoo shared a burrow for six years and raised a surrogate chick; the pair split when the male of a pair in the next burrow died and the female sought a new mate.

Buddy and Pedro, a pair of male African penguins, were separated by the Toronto Zoo to mate with female penguins in 2011. Buddy has since paired off with a female.

Suki and Chupchikoni are two female African penguins that pair bonded at the Ramat Gan Safari in Israel in 2013. Chupchikoni was assumed to be male until her blood was tested.

Jumbs and Kermit, two male Humboldt penguins at Wingham Wildlife Park, were given an egg from heterosexual couple Hurricane and Isobel. The egg failed to hatch. However, they were given another abandoned egg from the same couple which successfully hatched on 12 April 2014.

As of 2018, two female King penguins at Kelly Tarltons in Auckland, New Zealand, called Thelma and Louise (named after the 1991 film) have been in a relationship for eight years, when most of the other eligible penguins switch partners each mating season, regardless of their orientation. The two penguins were both taking care of an egg that Thelma hatched, but is unknown whether it was fertilized.

Sphen and Magic, two male gentoo penguins in Sea Life Sydney Aquarium, paired in 2018 and went on to raise two chicks, Lara (formerly Sphengic) and Clancy. Sphen died in 2024.

In September 2018 at Odense Zoo in Denmark, a male penguin couple took a chick from a heterosexual couple while they were swimming. Zoo staff speculated that the couple saw the biological parents as neglectful of the chick. The biological parents later confronted the couple and zoo staff returned the chick to them.

Marama and Rocky, two female gentoo penguins at Sea Life London Aquarium, had an &quot;incredibly strong bond&quot; for five years prior to adopting a chick who was born in June 2019. The chick was intentionally not gendered and was given a gender-neutral purple band for identification purposes. They were still a couple in 2021.

Skipper and Ping, two male penguins at Berlin Zoo, adopted an abandoned egg in July 2019.

A female penguin couple named Electra and Viola adopted, incubated and raised an egg from another couple at L&#x27;Oceanogràfic in Valencia in 2020.

A second same-sex female couple, Marmalade and Chickpea, formed at Sea Life London during the 2021 mating season.

====Vultures====
In 1998, two male griffon vultures named Dashik and Yehuda, at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, engaged in &quot;open and energetic sex&quot; and built a nest. The keepers provided the couple with an artificial egg, which the two parents took turns incubating, and 45 days later, the zoo replaced the egg with a baby vulture. The two male vultures raised the chick together. A few years later, however, Yehuda became interested in a female vulture that was brought into the aviary. Dashik became depressed, and was eventually moved to the zoological research garden at Tel Aviv University where he too set up a nest with a female vulture.

Two male vultures at the Allwetter Zoo in Muenster built a nest together, although they were picked on and their nest materials were often stolen by other vultures. They were eventually separated to try to promote breeding by placing one of them with female vultures, despite the protests of German homosexual groups.

====Pigeons====

Both male and female pigeons sometimes exhibit homosexual behavior. In addition to sexual behavior, same-sex pigeon pairs will build nests, and hens will lay (infertile) eggs and attempt to incubate them.

===Mammals===
====Amazon dolphins====
The Amazon river dolphin or boto has been reported to form up in bands of 3–5 individuals engaging in sexual activity. The groups usually comprise young males and sometimes one or two females. Sex is often performed in non-reproductive ways, using snout, flippers and genital rubbing, without regard to gender. In captivity, they have been observed to sometimes perform homosexual and heterosexual penetration of the blowhole, a hole homologous with the nostril of other mammals, making this the only known example of nasal sex in the animal kingdom. The males will sometimes also perform sex with males from the tucuxi species, a type of small porpoise.

====American bisons====
Courtship, mounting, and full anal penetration between bulls has been noted to occur among American bison. The Mandan nation Okipa festival concludes with a ceremonial enactment of this behavior, to &quot;ensure the return of the buffalo in the coming season&quot;. Also, mounting of one female by another (known as &quot;bulling&quot;) is extremely common among cattle. The behaviour is hormone driven and synchronizes with the emergence of estrus (heat), particularly in the presence of a bull.

====Bats====
More than 20 species of bat have been documented to engage in homosexual behavior. Bat species that have been observed engaging in homosexual behavior in the wild include:
Bat species that have been observed engaging in homosexual behavior in captivity include the Comoro flying fox (&quot;Pteropus livingstonii&quot;), the Rodrigues flying fox (&quot;Pteropus rodricensis&quot;) and the common vampire bat (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;).

Homosexual behavior in bats has been categorized into 6 groups: mutual homosexual grooming and licking, homosexual masturbation, homosexual play, homosexual mounting, coercive sex, and cross-species homosexual sex.

In the wild, the grey-headed flying fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;) engages in allogrooming wherein one partner licks and gently bites the chest and wing membrane of the other partner. Both sexes display this form of mutual homosexual grooming and it is more common in males. Males often have erect penises while they are mutually grooming each other. Like opposite-sex grooming partners, same-sex grooming partners continuously utter a &quot;pre-copulation call&quot;, which is described as a &quot;pulsed grating call&quot;, while engaged in this activity.

In wild Bonin flying foxes (&quot;Pteropus pselaphon&quot;), males perform fellatio or &#x27;male-male genital licking&#x27; on other males. Male–male genital licking events occur repeatedly several times in the same pair, and reciprocal genital licking also occurs. The male-male genital licking in these bats is considered a sexual behavior. Allogrooming in Bonin flying foxes has never been observed, hence the male-male genital licking in this species does not seem to be a byproduct of allogrooming, but rather a behavior of directly licking the male genital area, independent of allogrooming. In captivity, same-sex genital licking has been observed among males of the Comoro flying fox (&quot;Pteropus livingstonii&quot;) as well as among males of the common vampire bat (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;).

In wild Indian flying foxes (&quot;Pteropus giganteus&quot;), males often mount one another, with erections and thrusting, while play-wrestling. Males of the long-fingered bat (&quot;Myotis capaccinii&quot;) have been observed in the same position of male-female mounting, with one gripping the back of the other&#x27;s fur. A similar behavior was also observed in the common bent-wing bat (&quot;Miniopterus schreibersii&quot;).

In wild little brown bats (&quot;Myotis lucifugus&quot;), males often mount other males (and females) during late autumn and winter, when many of the mounted individuals are torpid. 35% of matings during this period are homosexual. These coercive copulations usually include ejaculation and the mounted bat often makes a typical copulation call consisting of a long squawk. Similarly, in hibernacula of the common noctule (&quot;Nyctalus noctula&quot;), active males were observed to wake up from lethargy on a warm day and engage in mating with lethargic males and (active or lethargic) females. The lethargic males, like females, called out loudly and presented their buccal glands with opened mouth during copulation.

Vesey-Fitzgerald (1949) observed homosexual behaviours in all 12 British bat species known at the time: &quot;Homosexuality is common in the spring in all species, and, since the males are in full possession of their powers, I suspect throughout the summer...I have even seen homosexuality between Natterer&#x27;s and Daubenton&#x27;s bats (&quot;Myotis nattereri&quot; and &quot;M. daubentonii&quot;).&quot;

====Bottlenose dolphins====

Dolphins of several species engage in homosexual acts, though it is best studied in the bottlenose dolphins. Sexual encounters between females take the shape of &quot;beak-genital propulsion&quot;, where one female inserts her beak in the genital opening of the other while swimming gently forward. Between males, homosexual behaviour includes rubbing of genitals against each other, which sometimes leads to the males swimming belly to belly, inserting the penis in the other&#x27;s genital slit and sometimes anus.

Janet Mann, Georgetown University professor of biology and psychology, argues that the strong personal behavior among male dolphin calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context. She cites studies showing that these dolphins later in life as adults are in a sense bisexual, and the male bonds forged earlier in life work together for protection as well as locating females to reproduce with. Confrontations between flocks of bottlenose dolphins and the related species Atlantic spotted dolphin will sometimes lead to cross-species homosexual behaviour between the males rather than combat.

====Elephants====

African and Asian male elephants will engage in same-sex bonding and mounting. Such encounters are often associated with affectionate interactions, such as kissing, trunk intertwining, and placing trunks in each other&#x27;s mouths. Male elephants, who often live apart from the general herd, often form &quot;companionships&quot;, consisting of an older individual and one or sometimes two younger males with sexual behavior being an important part of the social dynamic. Unlike heterosexual relations, which are always of a fleeting nature, the relationships between males may last for years. The encounters are analogous to heterosexual bouts, one male often extending his trunk along the other&#x27;s back and pushing forward with his tusks to signify his intention to mount. Same-sex relations are common and frequent in both sexes, with Asiatic elephants in captivity devoting roughly 45% of sexual encounters to same-sex activity.

====Giraffes====

Male giraffes have been observed to engage in remarkably high frequencies of homosexual behavior. After aggressive &quot;necking&quot;, it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other, leading up to mounting and climax. Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94% of observed mounting incidents took place between two males. The proportion of same sex activities varied between 30 and 75%, and at any given time one in twenty males were engaged in non-combative necking behavior with another male. Only 1% of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.

==== Humpback whales ====
In 2022, photographers captured the first-ever images of humpback whales mating, both of which were males, off the coast of Maui. The whales were observed for 30 minutes, with one whale using its penis to penetrate the genital slit of the other.

====Marmots====
Homosexual behavior is quite common in wild marmots. In Olympic marmots (&quot;Marmota olympus&quot;) and hoary marmots (&quot;Marmota caligata&quot;), females often mount other females as well as engage in other affectionate and sexual behaviors with females of the same species. They display a high frequency of these behaviors especially when they are in heat. A homosexual encounter often begins with a greeting interaction in which one female nuzzles her nose on the other female&#x27;s cheek or mouth, or both females touch noses or mouths. Additionally, a female may gently chew on the ear or neck of her partner, who responds by raising her tail. The first female may sniff the other&#x27;s genital region or nuzzle that region with her mouth. She may then proceed to mount the other female, during which the mounting female gently grasps the mounted female&#x27;s dorsal neck fur in her jaws while thrusting. The mounted female arches her back and holds her tail to one side to facilitate their sexual interaction.

====Lions====

Both male and female lions have been seen to interact homosexually. Male lions pair-bond for a number of days and initiate homosexual activity with affectionate nuzzling and caressing, leading to mounting and thrusting. About 8% of mountings have been observed to occur with other males. Pairings between females are held to be fairly common in captivity but have not been observed in the wild.

====Polecats====
European polecats (&quot;Mustela putorius&quot;) were found to engage homosexually with non-sibling animals. Exclusive homosexuality with mounting and anal penetration in this solitary species serves no apparent adaptive function.

====Primates====
Same-sex sexual behaviors have been observed in New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and apes. These behaviors are much more common in Old World monkeys than New World monkeys, and all ape genera have been observed engaging in same-sex sexual behavior. Prosimians have not been observed engaging in same-sex sexual behavior. Same-sex mounting, for instance, has been observed in 16% of New World primate genera. In contrast, 76% of Old World monkey genera contain at least one species that has been observed in male-male mounts, and 70% of genera for female-female mounts. Same-sex mounting has been observed in all ape genera. Same-sex sexual behaviors likely evolved following the divergence of New World monkeys; these behaviors are a conserved trait among Old World monkeys and apes. Among Old World monkeys, same-sex genital interactions are much more common in multi-male systems as opposed to uni-male systems.

=====Bonobos=====

Bonobos form a matriarchal society, unusual among apes. They are fully bisexual: both males and females engage in hetero- and homosexual behavior, being noted for female–female sex in particular, including between juveniles and adults. Roughly 60% of all bonobo sexual activity occurs between two or more females. While the homosexual bonding system in bonobos represents the highest frequency of homosexuality known in any primate species, homosexuality has been reported for all great apes, as well as a number of other primate species.

Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal, who extensively observed and filmed bonobos, believed that sexual activity is the bonobo&#x27;s way of avoiding conflict. Anything that arouses the interest of more than one bonobo at a time, not just food, tends to result in sexual contact. If two bonobos approach a cardboard box thrown into their enclosure, they will briefly mount each other before playing with the box. Such situations lead to squabbles in most other species. But bonobos are quite tolerant, perhaps because they use sex to divert attention and to defuse tension.

Bonobo sex often occurs in aggressive contexts totally unrelated to food. A jealous male might chase another away from a female, after which the two males reunite and engage in scrotal rubbing. Or after a female hits a juvenile, the latter&#x27;s mother may lunge at the aggressor, an action that is immediately followed by genital rubbing between the two adults.

===== Chimpanzees =====
Compared to bonobos, less research has been conducted on same-sex sexual behaviors in chimpanzees (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;). In contrast to bonobos, same-sex sexual behaviors are less common in Kibale chimpanzees (&quot;Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii&quot;) and primarily occur between adult males. While less frequent than in female bonobos, same-sex sexual behaviors between male chimpanzees occur regularly and in a variety of contexts. Female chimpanzees are much less likely to engage in same-sex sexual behaviors than males.

===== Gibbons =====
There is one published study of same-sex sexual behavior in white-handed gibbons (&quot;Hylobates lar&quot;). The authors report on observations of an adult male mounting an adolescent male. In gibbons, same-sex sexual behavior is likely rare.

=====Gorillas=====
Both male and female mountain gorillas (&quot;Gorilla gorilla beringei&quot;) have been observed engaging in same-sex sexual behaviors. Homosexual behavior among male gorillas has been studied. This behavior occurs more often in all-male bachelor packs in the wild and it is believed to play a role in social bonding. Homosexual behavior among female mountain gorillas has also been documented. Among all-male &quot;bachelor&quot; groups, same-sex sexual interactions are extremely common. Female mountain gorillas engage in same-sex sexual behaviors frequently as well, and coincided in prevalence in accordance with intersexual copulations as well. As opposed to conferring social status, same-sex sexual behaviors are likely reflective of elevated arousal in female mountain gorillas. Same-sex sexual behaviors are natural and common among mountain gorillas.

=====Orangutans=====
Homosexual behavior forms part of the natural repertoire of sexual or sociosexual behavior of orangutans. Male homosexual behavior occurs both in the wild and in captivity, and it occurs in both adolescent and mature individuals. Homosexual behavior in orangutans is not an artifact of captivity or contact with humans.

Sociosexual behaviors among orangutans (&quot;Pongo spp.&quot;) are extremely common and invoke a variety of evolutionary strategies. However, only one study of same-sex sexual behavior has been published. In Sumatran orangutans (&quot;Pongo abelii&quot;), same-sex sexual behavior has been documented among two dyads of unflanged adolescent males. Oral contact with genitals and behavior similar to male-female forced copulation between sexually mature sub-adult males were observed.

=====Monkeys=====
Among monkeys, Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox conducted a study on how Depo-Provera contraceptives lead to decreased male attraction to females.

======Japanese macaques======

With the Japanese macaque, also known as the &quot;snow monkey&quot;, same-sex relations are frequent, though rates vary between troops. Females will form &quot;ships&quot; characterized by affectionate social and sexual activities. In some troops up to one quarter of the females form such bonds, which vary in duration from a few days to a few weeks. Often, strong and lasting friendships result from such pairings. Males also have same-sex relations, typically with multiple partners of the same age. Affectionate and playful activities are associated with such relations.

====Sheep====

&quot;Ovis aries,&quot; the common domesticated sheep, has attracted much attention due to the fact that around 8–10% of rams have an exclusive homosexual orientation. Such rams prefer to court and mount other rams only, even in the presence of estrous ewes. Moreover, around 18–22% of rams are bisexual.

Several observations indicate that male–male sexual preference in rams is sexually motivated. Rams routinely perform the same courtship behaviors (including foreleg kicks, nudges, vocalizations, anogenital sniffs and flehmen) prior to mounting other males as observed when other rams court and mount estrous females. Furthermore, pelvic thrusting and ejaculation often accompany same-sex mounts by rams.

====Spotted hyenas====

The family structure of the spotted hyena is matriarchal, and dominance relationships with strong sexual elements are routinely observed between related females. Due largely to the female spotted hyena&#x27;s unique urogenital system, which looks more like a penis rather than a vagina, early naturalists thought hyenas were hermaphroditic males who commonly practiced homosexuality. Early writings such as Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and the &quot;Physiologus&quot; suggested that the hyena continually changed its sex and nature from male to female and back again. In &quot;Paedagogus&quot;, Clement of Alexandria noted that the hyena (along with the hare) was &quot;quite obsessed with sexual intercourse&quot;. Many Europeans associated the hyena with sexual deformity, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior, and even witchcraft.

The reality behind the confusing reports is the sexually aggressive behavior between the females, including mounting between females. Research has shown that &quot;in contrast to most other female mammals, female &quot;Crocuta&quot; are male-like in appearance, larger than males, and substantially more aggressive,&quot; and they have &quot;been masculinized without being defeminized&quot;.

Study of this unique genitalia and aggressive behavior in the female hyena has led to the understanding that more aggressive females are better able to compete for resources, including food and mating partners. Research has shown that &quot;elevated levels of testosterone in utero&quot; contribute to extra aggressiveness; both males and females mount members of both the same and opposite sex, who in turn are possibly acting more submissive because of lower levels of testosterone in utero.

===Reptiles===
====Lizards====

Several species of whiptail lizard (especially in the genus &quot;Aspidoscelis&quot;) consist only of females that have the ability to reproduce through parthenogenesis. Females engage in sexual behavior to stimulate ovulation, with their behavior following their hormonal cycles; during low levels of estrogen, these (female) lizards engage in &quot;masculine&quot; sexual roles. Those animals with currently high estrogen levels assume &quot;feminine&quot; sexual roles. Some parthenogenetic lizards that perform the courtship ritual have greater fertility than those kept in isolation due to an increase in hormones triggered by the sexual behaviors. So, even though asexual whiptail lizards populations lack males, sexual stimuli still increase reproductive success. From an evolutionary standpoint, these females are passing their full genetic code to all of their offspring (rather than the 50% of genes that would be passed in sexual reproduction). Certain species of gecko also reproduce by parthenogenesis.

Some species of sexually reproducing geckos have also been found to display homosexual behavior, e.g. the day geckos &quot;Phelsuma laticauda&quot; and &quot;Phelsuma cepediana&quot;.

====Tortoises====
Jonathan, the world&#x27;s oldest tortoise (an Aldabra giant tortoise), had been mating with another tortoise named Frederica since 1991. In 2017, it was discovered that Frederica was actually probably male all along, and was renamed Frederic.

===Insects and arachnids===
There is evidence of same-sex sexual behavior in at least 110 species of insects and arachnids. Scharf et al. says: &quot;Males are more frequently involved in same-sex sexual (SSS) behavior in the laboratory than in the field, and isolation, high density, and exposure to female pheromones increase its prevalence. SSS behavior is often shorter than the equivalent heterosexual behavior. Most cases can be explained via mistaken identification by the active (courting/mounting) male. Passive males often resist courting/mating attempts&quot;.

Scharf et al. continues: &quot;SSS behavior has been reported in most insect orders, and Bagemihl (1999) provides a list of ~100 species of insects demonstrating such behavior. Yet, this list lacks detailed descriptions, and a more comprehensive summary of its prevalence in invertebrates, as well as ethology, causes, implications, and evolution of this behavior, remains lacking&quot;.

====Dragonflies====
Male homosexuality has been inferred in several species of dragonflies (the order Odonata). The cloacal pinchers of male damselflies and dragonflies inflict characteristic head damage to females during sex. A survey of 11 species of damsel and dragonflies has revealed such mating damages in 20 to 80% of the males too, indicating a fairly high occurrence of sexual coupling between males.

====Fruit flies====
Male &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; flies bearing two copies of a mutant allele in the fruitless gene court and attempt to mate exclusively with other males. The genetic basis of animal homosexuality has been studied in the fly &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;. Here, multiple genes have been identified that can cause homosexual courtship and mating. These genes are thought to control behavior through pheromones as well as altering the structure of the animal&#x27;s brains. These studies have also investigated the influence of environment on the likelihood of flies displaying homosexual behavior.

====Bed bugs====

Male bed bugs (&quot;Cimex lectularius&quot;) are sexually attracted to any newly fed individual and this results in homosexual mounting. This occurs in heterosexual mounting by the traumatic insemination in which the male pierces the female abdomen with his needle-like penis. In homosexual mating this risks abdominal injuries as males lack the female counteradaptive spermalege structure. Males produce alarm pheromones to reduce such homosexual mating.

<doc id="547827" wikidata="Q2874240" url="?curid=547827" title="Loss aversion">
<text>In cognitive science and behavioral economics, loss aversion refers to a cognitive bias in which the same situation is perceived as worse if it is framed as a loss, rather than a gain. It should not be confused with risk aversion, which describes the rational behavior of valuing an uncertain outcome at less than its expected value.

When defined in terms of the pseudo-utility function as in cumulative prospect theory (CPT), the left-hand of the function increases much more steeply than gains, thus being more &quot;painful&quot; than the satisfaction from a comparable gain. Empirically, losses tend to be treated as if they were twice as large as an equivalent gain. Loss aversion was first proposed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman as an important component of prospect theory.

== History ==

In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and his associate Amos Tversky originally coined the term &quot;loss aversion&quot; in their initial proposal of prospect theory as an alternative descriptive model of decision making under risk. &quot;The response to losses is stronger than the response to corresponding gains&quot; is Kahneman&#x27;s definition of loss aversion.

After the first 1979 proposal in the prospect theory framework paper, Tversky and Kahneman used loss aversion for a paper in 1991 about a consumer choice theory that incorporates reference dependence, loss aversion, and diminishing sensitivity. Compared to the original paper above that discusses loss aversion in risky choices, Tversky and Kahneman (1991) discuss loss aversion in riskless choices, for instance, not wanting to trade or even sell something that is already in our possession. Here, &quot;losses loom larger than gains&quot; correspondingly reflects how outcomes below the reference level (e.g. what we do not own) loom larger than those above the reference level (e.g. what we own), showing people&#x27;s tendency to value losses more than gains relative to a reference point. Additionally, the paper supported loss aversion with the endowment effect theory and status quo bias theory. Loss aversion was popular in explaining many phenomena in traditional choice theory. In 1980, loss aversion was used in Thaler (1980) regarding endowment effect. Loss aversion was also used to support the status quo bias in 1988, and the equity premium puzzle in 1995. In the 2000s, behavioural finance was an area with frequent application of this theory, including on asset prices and individual stock returns.

== Application ==
In marketing, the use of trial periods and rebates tries to take advantage of the buyer&#x27;s tendency to value the good more after the buyer incorporates it in the status quo. In past behavioral economics studies, users participate up until the threat of loss equals any incurred gains. Methods established by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin in experimental economics illustrates the role of expectation, wherein an individual&#x27;s belief about an outcome can create an instance of loss aversion, whether or not a tangible change of state has occurred. 

Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or as a gain is important to this calculation. The same change in price framed differently, for example as a $5 discount or as a $5 surcharge avoided, has a significant effect on consumer behavior. Although traditional economists consider this &quot;endowment effect&quot;, and all other effects of loss aversion, to be completely irrational, it is important to the fields of marketing and behavioral finance. Users in behavioral and experimental economics studies decided to cease participation in iterative money-making games when the threat of loss was close to the expenditure of effort, even when the user stood to further their gains. Loss aversion coupled with myopia has been shown to explain macroeconomic phenomena, such as the equity premium puzzle. Loss aversion to kinship is an explanation for aversion to inheritance tax.

== Prospect theory ==
Loss aversion is part of prospect theory, a cornerstone in behavioral economics. The theory explored numerous behavioral biases leading to sub-optimal decisions making. Kahneman and Tversky found that people are biased in their real estimation of probability of events happening. They tend to over-weight both low and high probabilities and under-weight medium probabilities.

One example is which option is more attractive between option A ($1,500 with a probability of 33%, $1,400 with a probability of 66%, and $0 with a probability of 1%) and option B (a guaranteed $920). Prospect theory and loss aversion suggests that most people would choose option B as they prefer the guaranteed $920 since there is a probability of winning $0, even though it is only 1%. This demonstrates that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point (i.e. current wealth) as opposed to absolute payoffs. When choices are framed as risky (i.e. risk losing 1 out of 10 lives vs the opportunity to save 9 out of 10 lives), individuals tend to be loss-averse as they weigh losses more heavily than comparable gains.

==Endowment effect==
Loss aversion was first proposed as an explanation for the endowment effect—the fact that people place a higher value on a good that they own than on an identical good that they do not own—by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990). Loss aversion and the endowment effect lead to a violation of the Coase theorem—that &quot;the allocation of resources will be independent of the assignment of property rights when costless trades are possible&quot;.

In several studies, the authors demonstrated that the endowment effect could be explained by loss aversion but not five alternatives, namely transaction costs, misunderstandings, habitual bargaining behaviors, income effects, and trophy effects. In each experiment, half of the subjects were randomly assigned a good and asked for the minimum amount they would be willing to sell it for while the other half of the subjects were given nothing and asked for the maximum amount they would be willing to spend to buy the good. Since the value of the good is fixed and individual valuation of the good varies from this fixed value only due to sampling variation, the supply and demand curves should be perfect mirrors of each other and thus half the goods should be traded. The authors also ruled out the explanation that lack of experience with trading would lead to the endowment effect by conducting repeated markets.

The first two alternative explanation are that under-trading was due to transaction costs or misunderstanding—were tested by comparing goods markets to induced-value markets under the same rules. If it was possible to trade to the optimal level in induced value markets, under the same rules, there should be no difference in goods markets. The results showed drastic differences between induced-value markets and goods markets. The median prices of buyers and sellers in induced-value markets matched almost every time leading to near perfect market efficiency, but goods markets sellers had much higher selling prices than buyers&#x27; buying prices. This effect was consistent over trials, indicating that this was not due to inexperience with the procedure or the market. Since the transaction cost that could have been due to the procedure was equal in the induced-value and goods markets, transaction costs were eliminated as an explanation for the endowment effect.

The third alternative explanation was that people have habitual bargaining behaviors, such as overstating their minimum selling price or understating their maximum bargaining price, that may spill over from strategic interactions where these behaviors are useful to the laboratory setting where they are sub-optimal. An experiment was conducted to address this by having the clearing prices selected at random. Buyers who indicated a willingness-to-pay (WTP) higher than the randomly drawn price got the good, and vice versa for those who indicated a lower WTP. Likewise, sellers who indicated a lower willingness-to-accept than the randomly drawn price sold the good and vice versa. This incentive compatible value elicitation method did not eliminate the endowment effect but did rule out habitual bargaining behavior as an alternative explanation.

Income effects were ruled out by giving one third of the participants mugs, one third chocolates, and one third neither mug nor chocolate. They were then given the option of trading the mug for the chocolate or vice versa and those with neither were asked to merely choose between mug and chocolate. Thus, wealth effects were controlled for those groups who received mugs and chocolate. The results showed that 86% of those starting with mugs chose mugs, 10% of those starting with chocolates chose mugs, and 56% of those with nothing chose mugs. This ruled out income effects as an explanation for the endowment effect. Also, since all participants in the group had the same good, it could not be considered a &quot;trophy&quot;, eliminating the final alternative explanation. Thus, the five alternative explanations were eliminated, the first two through induced-value market vs. consumption goods market, the third with incentive compatible value elicitation procedure, and the fourth and fifth through a choice between endowed or alternative good.

==Criticisms==
Multiple studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. In several studies examining the effect of losses in decision-making, no loss aversion was found under risk and uncertainty. There are several explanations for these findings: one is that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes (called magnitude dependent loss aversion by Mukherjee et al.(2017); which seems to hold true for time as well. The other is that the generality of the loss aversion pattern is lower than previously thought. David Gal (2006) argued that many of the phenomena commonly attributed to loss aversion, including the status quo bias, the endowment effect, and the preference for safe over risky options, are more parsimoniously explained by psychological inertia than by a loss/gain asymmetry. Gal and Rucker (2018) made similar arguments. Mkrva, Johnson, Gächter, and Herrmann (2019) cast doubt on these critiques, replicating loss aversion in five unique samples while also showing how the magnitude of loss aversion varies in theoretically predictable ways. 

Loss aversion may be more salient when people compete. Gill and Prowse (2012) provide experimental evidence that people are loss averse around reference points given by their expectations in a competitive environment with real effort. Losses may also have an effect on attention but not on the weighting of outcomes; losses lead to more autonomic arousal than gains even in the absence of loss aversion. This latter effect is sometimes known as Loss Attention.

==Loss attention as alternative==
Loss attention refers to the tendency of individuals to allocate more attention to a task or situation when it involve losses than when it does not involve losses. What distinguishes loss attention from loss aversion is that it does not imply that losses are given more subjective weight (or utility) than gains. Moreover, under loss aversion losses have a &quot;biasing&quot; effect whereas under loss attention they can have a &quot;debiasing&quot; effect. Loss attention was proposed as a distinct regularity from loss aversion by Eldad Yechiam and Guy Hochman.
Specifically, the effect of losses is assumed to be on general attention rather than plain visual or auditory attention. The loss attention account assumes that losses in a given task mainly increase the general attentional resource pool available for that task. The increase in attention is assumed to have an inverse-U shape effect on performance (following the so called Yerkes-Dodson law). The inverse U-shaped effect implies that the effect of losses on performance is most apparent in settings where task attention is low to begin with, for example in a monotonous vigilance task or when a concurrent task is more appealing. Indeed, it was found that the positive effect of losses on performance in a given task was more pronounced in a task performed concurrently with another task which was primary in its importance.

Loss attention is consistent with several empirical findings in economics, finance, marketing, and decision making. Some of these effects have been previously attributed to loss aversion, but can be explained by a mere attention asymmetry between gains and losses. An example is the performance advantage attributed to golf rounds where a player is under par (or in a disadvantage) compared to other rounds where a player is at an advantage. Clearly, the difference could be attributed to increased attention in the former type of rounds. 2010s studies suggested that loss aversion mostly occur for very large losses, although the exact boundaries of the effect are unclear. On the other hand, loss attention was found even for small payoffs, such as $1. This suggests that loss attention may be more robust than loss aversion. Still, one might argue that loss aversion is more parsimonious than loss attention.

===Additional phenomena explained by loss attention===
* Increased expected value maximization with losses – It was found that individuals are more likely to select choice options with higher expected value (namely, mean outcome) in tasks where outcomes are framed as losses than when they are framed as gains. Yechiam and Hochman found that this effect occurred even when the alternative producing higher expected value was the one that included minor losses. Namely, a highly advantageous alternative producing minor losses was more attractive compared when it did not produce losses. Therefore, paradoxically, in their study minor losses led to more selection from the alternative generating them (refuting an explanation of this phenomenon based on loss aversion). 
* Loss arousal – Individuals were found to display greater Autonomic Nervous System activation following losses than following equivalent gains. For example, pupil diameter and heart rate were found to increase following both gains and losses, but the size of the increase was higher following losses. Importantly, this was found even for small losses and gains where individuals do not show loss aversion. Similarly, a positive effect of losses compared to equivalent gains was found on activation of midfrontal cortical networks 200 to 400 milliseconds after observing the outcome. This effect as well was found in the absence of loss aversion.
* Increased hot stove effect for losses – The hot stove effect is the finding that individuals avoid a risky alternative when the available information is limited to the obtained payoffs. A relevant example (proposed by Mark Twain) is of a cat which jumped of a hot stove and will never do it again, even when the stove is cold and potentially contains food. In a finding that is consistent with the notion that losses increase attention, when a given option produces losses, this increases the hot stove effect.
* Out of pocket phenomenon – In financial decision making, it has been shown that people are more motivated when their incentives are to avoid losing personal resources, as opposed to gaining equivalent resources. Traditionally, this strong behavioral tendency was explained by loss aversion; however, it could also be explained simply as increased attention.
* Allure of minor disadvantages – In marketing studies, it has been demonstrated that products whose minor negative features are highlighted (in addition to positive features) are perceived as more attractive. Similarly, messages discussing both the advantages and disadvantages of a product were found to be more convincing than one-sided messages. Loss attention explains this as due to attentional competition between options, and increased attention following the highlighting of small negatives, which can increase the attractiveness of a product or a candidate either due to exposure or learning.

== Evolutionary psychology ==
Two types of explanations have been proposed for loss aversion. First, loss aversion may arise because downside risks are more threatening to survival than upside opportunities. Humans are theorized to be hardwired for loss aversion due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains: &quot;for an organism operating close to the edge of survival, the loss of a day&#x27;s food could cause death, whereas the gain of an extra day&#x27;s food would not cause an extra day of life (unless the food could be easily and effectively stored)&quot;. This explanation has been proposed by Kahneman himself: &quot;Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.&quot; 

It has also been proposed that loss aversion may be a useful feature of cognition by keeping aspirations around the level of achievement within our reach. From this perspective, loss aversion prevents us from setting aspirations that are too high and unrealistic. If we set aspirations too high, loss aversion increases the subjective pain of failing to reach them. Loss aversion complements the existence of anticipatory utility, which encourages us not to set aspirations that are too low.

=== In nonhuman subjects ===

In 2005, experiments were conducted on the ability of capuchin monkeys to use money. After several months of training, the monkeys began showing behavior considered to reflect understanding of the concept of a medium of exchange. They exhibited the same propensity to avoid perceived losses demonstrated by human subjects and investors. Chen, Lakshminarayanan and Santos (2006) also conducted experiments on capuchin monkeys to determine whether behavioral biases extend across species. In one of their experiments, subjects were presented with two choices that both delivered an identical payoff of one apple piece in exchange of their coins. Experimenter 1 displayed one apple piece and gave that exact amount. Experimenter 2 displayed two apple pieces initially but always removed one piece before delivering the remaining apple piece to the subject. Therefore, identical payoffs are yielded regardless of which experimenter the subject traded with. It was found that subjects strongly preferred the experimenter who initially displayed only one apple piece, even though both experimenters yielded the same outcome of one apple piece. This study suggests that capuchins weighted losses more heavily than equivalent gains.

== Expectation-based ==
Expectation-based loss aversion is a phenomenon in behavioral economics. When the expectations of an individual fail to match reality, they lose an amount of utility from the lack of experiencing fulfillment of these expectations. Analytical framework by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin provides a methodology through which such behavior can be classified and even predicted. An individual&#x27;s most recent expectations influences loss aversion in outcomes outside the status quo; a shopper intending to buy a pair of shoes on sale experiences loss aversion when the pair they had intended to buy is no longer available.

Subsequent research performed by Johannes Abeler, Armin Falk, Lorenz Goette, and David Huffman in conjunction with the Institute of Labor Economics used the framework of Kőszegi and Rabin to prove that people experience expectation-based loss aversion at multiple thresholds. The study evinced that reference points of people causes a tendency to avoid expectations going unmet. Participants were asked to participate in an iterative money-making task given the possibilities that they would receive either an accumulated sum for each round of &quot;work&quot;, or a predetermined amount of money. With a 50% chance of receiving the &quot;fair&quot; compensation, participants were more likely to quit the experiment as this amount approached the fixed payment. They chose to stop when the values were equal as no matter which random result they received, their expectations would be matched. Participants were reluctant to work for more than the fixed payment as there was an equal chance their expected compensation would not be met.

==Within education==

Loss aversion experimentation has most recently been applied within an educational setting in an effort to improve achievement within the U.S. In this latest experiment, Fryer et al. posits framing merit pay in terms of a loss in order to be most effective. This study was performed in the city of Chicago Heights within nine K-8 urban schools, which included 3,200 students. 150 out of 160 eligible teachers participated and were assigned to one of four treatment groups or a control group. Teachers in the incentive groups received rewards based on their students&#x27; end of the year performance on the ThinkLink Predictive Assessment and K-2 students took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS). The control group followed the traditional merit pay process of receiving &quot;bonus pay&quot; at the end of the year based on student performance on standardized exams. The experimental groups received a lump sum given at beginning of the year, that would have to be paid back. The bonus was equivalent to approximately 8% of the average teacher salary in Chicago Heights, approximately $8,000. According to the authors, &#x27;this suggests that there may be significant potential for exploiting loss aversion in the pursuit of both optimal public policy and the pursuit of profits&#x27;. Thomas Amadio, superintendent of Chicago Heights Elementary School District 170, where the experiment was conducted, stated that &quot;the study shows the value of merit pay as an encouragement for better teacher performance&quot;.

== Neural aspect ==
In earlier studies, both bidirectional mesolimbic responses of activation for gains and deactivation for losses (or vice versa) and gain or loss-specific responses have been seen. While reward anticipation is associated with ventral striatum activation, negative outcome anticipation engages the amygdala. Only some studies have shown involvement of amygdala during negative outcome anticipation but not others, which has led to some inconsistencies. It has later been proven that inconsistencies may only have been due to methodological issues including the utilisation of different tasks and stimuli, coupled with ranges of potential gains or losses sampled from either payoff matrices rather than parametric designs, and most of the data are reported in groups, therefore ignoring the variability amongst individuals. Rather than focusing on subjects in groups, later studies focus more on individual differences in the neural bases by jointly looking at behavioural analyses and neuroimaging 

Neuroimaging studies on loss aversion involves measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether individual variability in loss aversion were reflected in differences in brain activity through bidirectional or gain or loss specific responses, as well as multivariate source-based morphometry (SBM) to investigate a structural network of loss aversion and univariate voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify specific functional regions within this network.

Brain activity in a right ventral striatum cluster increases particularly when anticipating gains. This involves the ventral caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen, bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, superior frontal and middle gyri, posterior cingulate cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and parts of the dorsomedial thalamus connecting to temporal and prefrontal cortex. There is a significant correlation between degree of loss aversion and strength of activity in both the frontomedial cortex and the ventral striatum. This is shown by the slope of brain activity deactivation for increasing losses being significantly greater than the slope of activation for increasing gains in the appetitive system involving the ventral striatum in the network of reward-based behavioural learning. On the other hand, when anticipating loss, the central and basal nuclei of amygdala, right posterior insula extending into the supramarginal gyrus mediate the output to other structures involved in the expression of fear and anxiety, such as the right parietal operculum and supramarginal gyrus. Consistent with gain anticipation, the slope of the activation for increasing losses was significantly greater than the slope of the deactivation for increasing gains.

Multiple neural mechanisms are recruited while making choices, showing functional and structural individual variability. Biased anticipation of negative outcomes leading to loss aversion involves specific somatosensory and limbic structures. fMRI test measuring neural responses in striatal, limbic and somatosensory brain regions help track individual differences in loss aversion. Its limbic component involved the amygdala (associated with negative emotion and plays a role in the expression of fear) and putamen in the right hemisphere. The somatosensory component included the middle cingulate cortex, as well as the posterior insula and rolandic operculum bilaterally. The latter cluster partially overlaps with the right hemispheric one displaying the loss-oriented bidirectional response previously described, but, unlike that region, it mostly involved the posterior insula bilaterally. All these structures play a critical role in detecting threats and prepare the organism for appropriate action, with the connections between amygdala nuclei and the striatum controlling the avoidance of aversive events. There are functional differences between the right and left amygdala. Overall, the role of amygdala in loss anticipation suggested that loss aversion may reflect a Pavlovian conditioned approach-avoidance response. Hence, there is a direct link between individual differences in the structural properties of this network and the actual consequences of its associated behavioral defense responses. The neural activity involved in the processing of aversive experience and stimuli is not just a result of a temporary fearful overreaction prompted by choice-related information, but rather a stable component of one&#x27;s own preference function, reflecting a specific pattern of neural activity encoded in the functional and structural construction of a limbic-somatosensory neural system anticipating heightened aversive state of the brain. Even when no choice is required, individual differences in the intrinsic responsiveness of this interoceptive system reflect the impact of anticipated negative effects on evaluative processes, leading preference for avoiding losses rather than acquiring greater but riskier gains. 

Individual differences in loss aversion are related to variables such as age, gender, and genetic factors, all of which affect thalamic norepinephrine transmission, as well as neural structure and activities. Outcome anticipation and ensuing loss aversion involve multiple neural systems, showing functional and structural individual variability directly related to the actual outcomes of choices. In a study, adolescents and adults are found to be similarly loss-averse on behavioural level but they demonstrated different underlying neural responses to the process of rejecting gambles. Although adolescents rejected the same proportion of trials as adults, adolescents displayed greater caudate and frontal pole activation than adults to achieve this. These findings suggest a difference in neural development during the avoidance of risk. It is possible that adding affectively arousing factors (e.g. peer influences) may overwhelm the reward-sensitive regions of the adolescent decision making system leading to risk-seeking behaviour. On the other hand, although men and women did not differ on their behavioural task performance, men showed greater neural activation than women in various areas during the task. Loss of striatal dopamine neurons is associated with reduced risk-taking behaviour. Acute administration of D2 dopamine agonists may cause an increase in risky choices in humans. This suggests dopamine acting on stratum and possibly other mesolimbic structures can modulate loss aversion by reducing loss prediction signalling.

<text>Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer (January 6, 1914 – December 26, 1997) was an American physical and theoretical chemist, educator, and university president. He was described as &quot;one of the most influential physical chemists of his era&quot; whose work &quot;spanned almost all of the important fields of physical chemistry: thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, molecular structure, quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, chemical bonding, relativistic chemical effects, properties of concentrated aqueous salt solutions, kinetics, and conformational analysis.&quot;

==Biography==
Pitzer received his B.S. in 1935 from the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937. Upon graduation, he was appointed to the faculty of UC Berkeley&#x27;s chemistry department and was eventually promoted to professor. From 1951 to 1960, he served as dean of the College of Chemistry.

Pitzer was the third president of Rice University from 1961 until 1968 and sixth president of Stanford University from 1969 until 1971. His tenure at Stanford was turbulent due to student protests. Worn out by the confrontations, he announced his resignation in 1970 after a 19-month tenure. He returned to UC Berkeley in 1971. He retired in 1984, but continued research and scientific writing until his death.

Pitzer was director of research for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission from 1949 to 1951 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1954 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.

As a scientist, Pitzer was known for his work on the thermodynamic properties of molecules. While still a graduate student he discovered that hydrocarbon molecules do not rotate unhindered around their C-C bonds. There is in fact a barrier to internal rotation, an important discovery upsetting the conventional wisdom and affecting the thermodynamic properties of hydrocarbons. Some of his work is summed up in the Pitzer equations describing the behavior of ions dissolved in water. During his long career he won many awards, most notably the National Medal of Science and the Priestley Medal. The Ohio Supercomputing System named their new cluster Pitzer in honour of Kenneth Pitzer.

In the public hearing that led to the revocation of Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance, Pitzer testified about his policy differences with Oppenheimer concerning the development of thermonuclear weapons.

==Personal life==
Pitzer&#x27;s father, Russell K. Pitzer, founded Pitzer College, one of the five Claremont Colleges in California. His son, Russell M. Pitzer is also a notable chemist who is currently retired from the faculty at Ohio State University.

<doc id="547834" wikidata="Q57320" url="?curid=547834" title="Frederick Augustus III of Saxony">
<text>Frederick Augustus III (; 25 May 1865 – 18 February 1932) was the last King of Saxony (1904–1918). Born in Dresden, Frederick Augustus was the eldest son of King George of Saxony and his wife, Maria Anna of Portugal.

Frederick Augustus served in the Royal Saxon Army before becoming king, and later was promoted to . Though well-loved by his subjects, he voluntarily abdicated as king on 13 November 1918, after the defeat of the German Empire in World War I. He died in his Sibyllenort Palace in Lower Silesia (now Szczodre in Poland) and was buried in Dresden.

==Military career==
Frederick Augustus entered the Royal Saxon Army in 1877 as a second lieutenant, despite being only twelve years old. Given his royal status, he advanced rapidly through the ranks. He served initially with the Royal Saxon &quot;1. (Leib-) Grenadier Regiment Nr. 100&quot;. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1883, captain in 1887, major in 1889 and lieutenant colonel in 1891. By 1891, he was commander of the 1st Battalion of &quot;Schützen (Füsilier)-Regiment Nr. 108&quot;. He was promoted to colonel on 22 September 1892 and took command of the &quot;Schützen (Füsilier)-Regiment Nr. 108&quot; on the same day. On 20 September 1894, the 29-year-old prince was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and given command of the 1st Royal Saxon Infantry Brigade Nr. 45 (Saxon higher units usually bore two numbers: one their Saxon Army number and the other their number in the Prussian Army order of battle). On 22 May 1898, he was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; and given command of the 1st Royal Saxon Infantry Division Nr. 23. He commanded this division until 26 August 1902, when he took command of the XII (1st Royal Saxon) Corps. He was promoted to &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; one month later, on 24 September. He remained in command of the corps until October 1904, when he became king. His military career effectively ended with his accession to the throne, but he was promoted subsequently to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; and then to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (on 9 September 1912).

Following his father&#x27;s accession, he was in July 1902 appointed &quot;à la suite&quot; of the German Marine Infantry by Emperor Wilhelm II during a visit to Kiel.

==Abdication==
When the German Revolution of 1918 broke out in November, Frederick Augustus made no attempt to defend the Saxon monarchy. Knowing that it was futile to continue the war, he demurred when asked to quell a worker-sponsored uprising in the Altmarkt with troops still loyal to the king, and instead quietly left Dresden Castle through a side-gate to Moritzburg Castle.

While seeking refuge in Guteborn, he received news that Hermann Fleissner had proclaimed the Free State of Saxony on 10 November. Three days later, he signed his abdication on a single sheet of paper that consisted of one sentence: &quot;I renounce the throne&quot;. Frederick Augustus then relieved all Saxons of their oath of loyalty to the monarchy, calling for unity and urging the citizens to work towards the better good of the state, whereupon he withdrew to Sibyllenort Palace, which he privately owned, near Breslau.

==Family==
Frederick Augustus married Archduchess Louise of Austria, in Vienna on 21 November 1891. They were divorced in 1903 by the royal decree of the King after she ran away while pregnant with her last child. Luise&#x27;s flight from Dresden was due to her father-in-law&#x27;s threatening to have her interned in a mental asylum at the Sonnenstein Castle for life. Her brother supported her in her wish to escape from Saxony. Emperor Franz-Josef of Austria-Hungary did not recognise the divorce.

They had seven children:
* Friedrich August Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony (1893–1943). After becoming a Jesuit priest, he renounced his rights in 1923. He was allegedly assassinated by the SS or Gestapo in 1943.
* Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen, Duke of Saxony (1893–1968). Married Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis (1903–1976) and had issue.
* Ernst Heinrich (1896–1971). Married first Princess Sophie of Luxembourg (1902–1941), daughter of Guillaume IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, in 1921 and second Virginia Dulon (1910–2002) in 1947 (morganatically). Had issue with Sophie.
* Maria Alix Carola, stillborn 22 August 1898
* Margarete Carola Wilhelmine (1900–1962). Married Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern (1891–1965).
* Maria Alix Luitpolda (1901–1990). Married Franz Joseph, Prince of Hohenzollern-Emden (1891–1964).
* Anna Monika Pia (1903–1976). Married firstly Archduke Joseph Franz of Austria (1895–1957) and secondly Reginald Kazanjian (1905–1990).

Their two eldest sons, Friedrich August and Friedrich Christian, were both born in 1893, but were not twins. Friedrich August was born in January, and Friedrich Christian was born in December.

==Quotes==
Frederick Augustus was a popular monarch who was not particularly given to the formalities and luxuries of royalty. He often dressed in civilian clothes, was comfortable speaking in the vernacular Upper Saxon dialect, and was sometimes seen playing skat with his subjects in the pubs of Dresden. Several instances of his self-effacing sense of humour have been recorded.
* When standing in uniform on a station platform, he was asked by a lady to move her trunk. He is reported to have replied, &quot;Madam, I am not a porter; I only look like one.&quot;
* When the German Republic was proclaimed in 1918, he was asked by telephone whether he would abdicate willingly. He said: &quot;Oh, well, I suppose I&#x27;d better.&quot;
* When cheered by a crowd in a railway station several years after his abdication, he stuck his head out of the train&#x27;s window and shouted &quot;You&#x27;re a fine lot of republicans, I&#x27;ll say!&quot;

<doc id="547837" wikidata="Q4828471" url="?curid=547837" title="Avi Lewis">
<text>Avram David &quot;Avi&quot; Lewis (born May 1967) is a Canadian documentary filmmaker, former host of the Al Jazeera English show &quot;Fault Lines&quot; and former host of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) current-affairs programs &quot;CounterSpin&quot; and &quot;On the Map&quot;.

==Biography==

===Family===
Avi Lewis is the great-grandson of Moshe Losz (Lewis), an outspoken member of the Jewish Bund who left Svislach, Poland (absorbed by the Soviet Union during World War II, and today in Belarus), after being interrogated by the Russians and threatened with death or the Gulag for his political activity, he left for Montreal in 1921, with his wife Rose (&quot;née&quot; Lazarovitch) and three children. Avi Lewis is the grandson of former federal New Democratic Party leader David Lewis and the son of former Ontario NDP leader and diplomat Stephen Lewis and journalist Michele Landsberg. Avi Lewis is married to journalist and author Naomi Klein; his sister Ilana Landsberg-Lewis was the executive director of the Stephen Lewis Foundation.

Lewis grew up in Toronto, Ontario, and attended Jarvis Collegiate and Upper Canada College. He graduated from the University of Toronto in 1988.

Lewis was featured on the November 20, 2001, &quot;Life &amp; Times&quot; episode of &quot;The Lewis Family&quot;.

Avi Lewis&#x27;s genealogical search was featured on the January 31, 2008, episode of the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;

===Career===
Between 1996 and 1998, Avi Lewis was host of &quot;The NewMusic&quot;, a music magazine show on MuchMusic and Citytv. He also served as MuchMusic&#x27;s political specialist — by doing extensive special events coverage for the channel designed to engage youth in the political process. Among other events, he covered the 1993 Canadian federal election and the 1995 Quebec referendum. Avi Lewis won a Gemini for Best Event Coverage.

In 1998–2001, Lewis hosted CBC Newsworld&#x27;s current affairs discussion show &quot;counterSpin&quot;, where he presided over 500 debates. Avi Lewis was later the host of &quot;Counterspin&quot; Sunday.

In 2004, Lewis and his wife Naomi Klein collaborated on &quot;The Take&quot; — a documentary that detailed the &quot;recovered factory&quot; movement in Argentina. &quot;The Take&quot;, winner of the International Jury Prize, was nominated for four Gemini Awards.

Lewis began hosting CBC Newsworld&#x27;s &quot;The Big Picture with Avi Lewis&quot; in the autumn of 2006 and &quot;On the Map&quot; in 2007. He became host of Frontline USA for Al Jazeera television in 2008. Lewis was a participant in the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; 2009 (&quot;see&quot; below).

Lewis directed the 2015 feature-length documentary &quot;This Changes Everything&quot;, which finished second in the audience voting, for the documentary category, at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.

==&quot;On the Map&quot;==
In June 2007, CBC Newsworld debuted &quot;On the Map with Avi Lewis&quot;, a daily (Monday-Thursday) half-hour of international news commentary. Lewis discussed such issues as the &quot;Oil Law&quot; that the United States wished Iraq to adopt, women in Afghanistan, and what exactly is meant by the phrase &quot;ungoverned spaces&quot;. The show was officially renewed for November 2007 and then disappeared without ever airing again. &quot;On the Map&quot;&#x27;s half-hour time slot was replaced with a half-hour summary of the daily hour-long show &quot;Politics&quot; by Don Newman.

During the same time period, &quot;The Hour&quot;, which had a mix of news commentary and pop culture and provided a lighter fare than &quot;On the Map&quot;, became decidedly more oriented to pop culture - even though there has been some creep towards greater news commentary as the season progressed. George Stroumboulopoulos stated during the opening show, that the modification of format was because &quot;The Hour&quot; would now be shown right after &quot;The National&quot; (rather than before in previous seasons) when shown on the CBC main channel.

Lewis conducted a June 11, 2007, interview with political writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali. After repeatedly and openly sniggering at Hirsi Ali&#x27;s complimentary remarks about the United States, Lewis sharply questioned some of her views - including her denial of the existence of Islamophobia, her belief that Islam was inherently misogynistic, and her positive opinions concerning American democracy. Lewis compared Islamophobia to Anti-Semitism, seeing both as equally real, to which Ali replied: &quot;Racism is a universal trait, so is antisemitism, by the way. But I want us not to confuse a set of beliefs such as Islam, with ethnicity such as the hatred against Jews just because they are Jews, or against blacks just because they are black, or against gays just because of- it&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t do anything about. Whereas Islam is simply a set of beliefs, and it&#x27;s not Islamophobic to say ... this is being done in the name of your religion.&quot; The interview provoked a strongly critical response from right-wing commentators in the US and Canada.

Lewis has stated that Hugo Chávez&#x27;s actions do not match his rhetoric and has criticized Chávez for not doing more to close down the &quot;laboratory&quot; of policies which he had inherited from previous administrations. Naomi Klein, who credited Avi Lewis for his input into her book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;, links both stifling of dissent and concentration of power with the implementation of these earlier economic policies.

==&quot;Why Democracy?&quot;==
From October 8–18, 2007, Avi Lewis hosted the ten-part international documentary series &quot;Why Democracy?&quot; in Canada.

==&quot;Frontline USA&quot; / &quot;Inside USA&quot;==

&quot;Inside USA&quot; was first telecast on Al Jazeera on February 8, 2008, with the episode &quot;Politics of Race&quot;. Al Jazeera describes &quot;Inside USA&quot; as &quot;an in-depth look at the real issues at stake in the US presidential election.&quot;

&quot;Politics Of Race&quot; (February 22, 2008) focused on the situation in New Orleans and the disenfranchising of Black voters.

&quot;Native Americans&quot; (March 1, 2008) focused on Lakota Sioux separatism, social and economic issues surrounding the Lakota Sioux, Navajo and the Shoshone peoples. The last few minutes were devoted to the role online videos play in the American election - including a clip from &quot;Yes We Can&quot;.

==&quot;Canada Reads&quot;==
Lewis was a panelist in the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, which aired on March 2–6, 2009. &quot;Canada Reads&quot; is a seasonal show in which celebrities choose a book and advocate on its behalf. He presented, and successfully defended, the winning book, Lawrence Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot;.

==Leap Manifesto==
In September 2015, Lewis, Naomi Klein, and others launched the Leap Manifesto - which proposed broad changes to Canadian society and economics in order to respond to climate change through a policy framework that also addresses issues of wealth and income inequality, racism, and colonialism and in hopes of influencing the policy debate during the 2015 Canadian federal election campaign. In 2016, Lewis spearheaded a motion at the New Democratic Party of Canada&#x27;s federal election which would have had the party endorse the manifesto - in the end, the motion was amended to refer the manifesto to constituency associations for debate. Lewis and other manifesto signatories launched an organization to promote the manifesto&#x27;s vision in 2017, called The Leap, which operated until 2021 and was a key convenor of Canada&#x27;s Pact for a Green New Deal in 2019.

== Electoral politics ==
In May 2021, Lewis was nominated as the NDP&#x27;s candidate for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country, British Columbia for the 2021 Canadian federal election, which was subsequently called for September 20, 2021. Lewis&#x27; run for federal parliament was endorsed by environmentalist David Suzuki, actress Jane Fonda, playwright Eve Ensler, folk singer and activist Billy Bragg, and biologist Alexandra Morton. He came in third behind incumbent Liberal Patrick Weiler who has represented the riding since 2019 and Conservative John Weston, who had previously represented the district from 2008 until 2015.

In September 2024, Lewis was acclaimed as the NDP candidate in Vancouver Centre for the next Canadian federal election, expected in 2025.

Lewis supports shifting the NDP further to the left. He was speculated as a potential candidate in the 2017 NDP leadership race, but declined to run. He has also endorsed and campaigned for several progressive candidates in internal NDP elections. Including Anjali Appadurai in the 2022 BC NDP leadership race, Sandra Sousa in the 2025 Davenport NDP nomination race and Jäger Rosenberg in the 2024 BC NDP Powell River-Sunshine Coast nomination race.

<text>A place of worship is a specially designed structure or space where individuals or a group of people such as a come to perform acts of devotion, veneration, or religious study. A building constructed or used for this purpose is sometimes called a house of worship. Temples, churches, mosques, and synagogues are examples of structures created for worship. A monastery may serve both to house those belonging to religious orders and as a place of worship for visitors. Natural or topographical features may also serve as places of worship, and are considered holy or sacrosanct in some religions; the rituals associated with the Ganges river are an example in Hinduism.

Under international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions, religious buildings are offered special protection, similar to the protection guaranteed hospitals displaying the Red Cross or Red Crescent. These international laws of war bar firing upon or from a religious building.

Religious architecture expresses the religious beliefs, aesthetic choices, and economic and technological capacity of those who create or adapt it, and thus places of worship show great variety depending on time and place.

==Christianity==

The word &quot;&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;ekklesia&quot;, meaning &quot;the called-out ones&quot;. Its original meaning is to refer to the body of believers, or the body of Christ. The word &quot;church&quot; is used to refer to a Christian place of worship by some Christian denominations, including Anglicans and Catholics. Other Christian denominations, including the Religious Society of Friends, Mennonites, Christadelphians, and some unitarians, object to the use of the word &quot;church&quot; to refer to a building, as they argue that this word should be reserved for the body of believers who worship there. Instead, these groups use words such as &quot;Hall&quot; to identify their places of worship or any building in use by them for the purpose of assembly.
* Basilica (Roman Catholic)
* Cathedral or minster (seat of a diocesan bishop within the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches)
* Chapel &quot;(&quot;Capel&quot; in Welsh)&quot; – Presbyterian Church of Wales (Calvinistic Methodism), and some other denominations, especially non-conformist denominations. English law once reserved the term &quot;church&quot; to the Church of England. In Catholicism and Anglicanism, some smaller and &quot;private&quot; places of worship are called chapels.
* Church – Iglesia ni Cristo, Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant denominations
* Kirk (Scottish–cognate with church)
* Meeting House – Religious Society of Friends
* Meeting House – Christadelphians
* Meeting House and Temple – Mormons Latter-day Saints use &quot;meeting house&quot; and &quot;temple&quot; to denote two different types of buildings. Normal worship services are held in ward meeting houses (or chapels) while Mormon temples are reserved for special ordinances.
* Temple – French Protestants Protestant denominations installed in France in the early modern era use the word &quot;temple&quot; (as opposed to &quot;church&quot;, supposed to be Roman Catholic); some more recently built temples are called &quot;church&quot;.
* Orthodox temple – Orthodox Christianity (both Eastern and Oriental) an Orthodox temple is a place of worship with base shaped like Greek cross.
* Kingdom Hall – Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses may apply the term in a general way to any meeting place used for their formal meetings for worship, but apply the term formally to those places established by and for local congregations of up to 200 adherents. Their multi-congregation events are typically held at a meeting place termed &quot;Assembly Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot; (or &quot;Christian Convention Center of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;).

A Hindu temple is a symbolic house, seat and body of god. It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism. The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions, deploying circles and squares.

==Islam==
A mosque (), literally meaning &quot;place of prostration&quot;, is a place of worship for followers of Islam.
There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni jurisprudence (fiqh) for a place of worship to be considered a masjid, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas. There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and, in the Islamic Sharia law, after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the Last Day.

Many mosques have elaborate domes, minarets, and prayer halls, in varying styles of architecture. Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula, but are now found in all inhabited continents. The mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together for salat (صلاة ṣalāt, meaning &quot;prayer&quot;) as well as a center for information, education, social welfare, and dispute settlement. The imam leads the congregation in prayer.

<doc id="547850" wikidata="Q967832" url="?curid=547850" title="Japan Business Federation">
<text>The is an economic organization founded in May 2002 by amalgamation of Keidanren (, Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, established 1946; name sometimes used alone as abbreviation for whole organization) and Nikkeiren (, Japan Federation of Employers&#x27; Associations, established 1948), with Nikkeiren being absorbed into Keidanren.

The federation is commonly referred to as &quot;Keidanren&quot;, its 1,601 members consist of 1,281 companies, 129 industrial associations, and 47 regional economic organizations (as of June 15, 2010).

For most of the post-war period, Keidanren has been the voice of big business in Japan and is generally considered the most conservative of the country&#x27;s three major private sector led business associations. The other two organizations are the (日本商工会議所) and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (経済同友会).

According to the organization&#x27;s official website, the mission of the Keidanren is to: accelerate growth of Japan&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s economy, and to strengthen the corporations to create additional value to transform the Japanese economy into one that is sustainable and driven by the private sector by encouraging the ideas of individuals and local communities.

The current chairman is Masakazu Tokura of Sumitomo Chemical. He has been chairman of The Japan Business Federation since June 2021.

== Views ==

=== View on consumption tax ===
Keidanren supported the Noda government&#x27;s efforts to raise Japan&#x27;s consumption tax from 5% to 10%. It had previously called for the consumption tax to be raised even higher, to 15%.

=== Views on nuclear power ===
After the March 11 nuclear disaster and subsequent shutdown of all the nuclear plants in Japan, Keidanren called for their restart. This view was not shared by all business leaders, with Rakuten president Hiroshi Mikitani leaving the federation partly over this issue. Masayoshi Son of Softbank publicly objected to the focus on restarting the nuclear plants, but didn&#x27;t leave the federation over it.

=== Political donations ===
Keidanren and its predecessor bodies had a long history of providing substantial political donations to the Liberal Democratic Party. In the lead-up to the 2009 general election the Democratic Party of Japan made a pledge to ban political donations from companies and organizations. After the DPJ victory in that election, Keidanren stopped making political donations.

==Changes to board composition==
In 2002, when Keidanren took on its current form, two-thirds of its 18 vice-chairmen were from manufacturing companies. As of July 2012, only 8 of the 18 are filled by executives of manufacturers.

==Current board==

Below are the lists of presidents, Chair, Vice-presidents and Vice-Chairs of Japan Business Federation (as of July 1, 2021).

<doc id="547857" wikidata="Q1153614" url="?curid=547857" title="Mere-exposure effect">
<text>The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a liking or disliking for things merely because they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds. In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often people see a person, the more pleasing and likeable they find that person.

==Research==
Gustav Fechner conducted the earliest known research on the effect in 1876. Edward B. Titchener also documented the effect and described the &quot;glow of warmth&quot; felt in the presence of something familiar; however, his hypothesis was thrown out when results showed that the enhancement of preferences for objects did not depend on the individual&#x27;s subjective impressions of how familiar the objects were. The rejection of Titchener&#x27;s hypothesis spurred further research and the development of current theory.

The scholar best known for developing the mere-exposure effect is Robert Zajonc. Before conducting his research, he observed that exposure to a novel stimulus initially elicits a fear/avoidance response in all organisms. Each subsequent exposure to the novel stimulus causes less fear and more interest in the observing organism. After repeated exposure, the observing organism will begin to react fondly to the once novel stimulus. This observation led to the research and development of the mere-exposure effect.

===Zajonc (1960s–1990s)===
In the 1960s, a series of Robert Zajonc&#x27;s laboratory experiments demonstrated that simply exposing participants to a familiar stimulus led them to rate it more positively than other, similar stimuli that had not been presented before. At first, Zajonc looked at language and the frequency of words used. He found that overall positive words were used more than their negative counterparts. Later, he showed similar results for liking, pleasantness, and forced-choice measures from a variety of stimuli, such as polygons, drawings, photographs of expressions, nonsense words, and idiographs.

In 1980, Zajonc proposed the affective primacy hypothesis: that affective reactions (such as liking) can be &quot;elicited with minimal stimulus input.&quot; Through mere-exposure experiments, Zajonc sought to provide evidence for the affective-primacy hypothesis, namely that affective judgments are made without prior cognitive processes. He tested this hypothesis by presenting repeated stimuli to participants at suboptimal thresholds such that they did not show conscious awareness or recognition of the repeated stimuli (when asked whether they had seen the image, responses were at chance level), but continued to show affective bias toward the repeatedly exposed stimuli. Zajonc compared results from primes exposed longer, which allowed for conscious awareness, to stimuli shown so briefly that participants did not show conscious awareness. He found that the primes shown more briefly and not recognized prompted faster responses for liking than primes shown at conscious levels.

One experiment to test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks while they were still unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it.

Another experiment exposed two groups of people to Chinese characters for short times. Participants were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols the participants had previously seen were consistently rated more positively than those they had not. In a similar experiment, people were not asked to rate the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods than those without.

In yet another variation, participants were shown an image on a tachistoscope for a very brief duration that could not be perceived consciously. This subliminal exposure produced the same effect, though it is important to note that subliminal effects are unlikely to occur without controlled laboratory conditions.

According to Zajonc, the mere-exposure effect is capable of taking place without conscious cognition, and &quot;preferences need no inferences&quot;. This claim has spurred much research in the relationship between cognition and affect. Zajonc explains that if preferences (or attitudes) were based merely on information units with affect attached to them, then persuasion would be fairly simple. He argues that this is not the case: such simple persuasion tactics have failed miserably. Zajonc states that affective responses to stimuli happen much more quickly than cognitive responses, and that these responses are often made with much more confidence. He states that thought (cognition) and feeling (affect) are distinct, and that cognition is not free from affect, nor is affect free of cognition: that &quot;the form of experience that we came to call feeling accompanies all cognitions, that it arises early in the process of registration and retrieval, albeit weakly and vaguely, and that it derives from a parallel, separate, and partly independent system in the organism.&quot;

According to Zajonc, there is no empirical proof that cognition precedes any form of decision-making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues it is more likely that decisions are made with little to no cognition. He equates deciding upon something with liking it, meaning that we cognize reasons to rationalize a decision more often than deciding upon it. In other words, we make judgments first, and then seek to justify them by rationalization.

===Goetzinger (1968)===
Charles Goetzinger conducted an experiment using the mere-exposure effect on his class at Oregon State University. Goetzinger had a student come to class in a large black bag with only his feet visible. The black bag sat on a table in the back of the classroom. Goetzinger&#x27;s experiment was to observe if the students would treat the black bag in accordance to Zajonc&#x27;s mere-exposure effect. His hypothesis was confirmed. The students in the class first treated the black bag with hostility, which over time turned into curiosity, and eventually friendship. This experiment confirms Zajonc&#x27;s mere-exposure effect, by simply presenting the black bag over and over again to the students their attitudes were changed, or as Zajonc states &quot;mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus is a sufficient condition for the enhancement of his attitude toward it.&quot;

===Bornstein (1989)===
A meta-analysis of 208 experiments found that the mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of &quot;r&quot;=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, people generally like a song more after they have heard it a few times, but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase the strength of the effect. The effect is weaker on children, and for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike them even more.

===Zola–Morgan (2001)===
In support of Zajonc&#x27;s claim that affect does not need cognition to occur, Zola–Morgan conducted experiments on monkeys with lesions to the amygdala (the brain structure that is responsive to affective stimuli). In his experiments, Zola–Morgan proved that lesions to the amygdala impair affective functioning, but not cognitive processes. However, lesions in the hippocampus (the brain structure responsible for memory) impair cognitive functions but leave emotional responses fully functional.

=== Montoya et al. (2017) ===
These authors reviewed evidence that with sufficient repetitions the ascending curve for liking turns down (in the form of an inverted-U). The evidence goes back at least thirty years.

==Perceptual fluency ==
The mere-exposure effect posits that repeated exposure to a stimulus increases &quot;perceptual fluency&quot;, the ease with which a stimulus can be processed. Perceptual fluency, in turn, increases positive affect. Studies showed that repeated exposure increases perceptual fluency, confirming positive affect in autobiographical memory and perceptual learning, a finding supported in later studies.

==Application==

===Advertising===

The most obvious application of the mere-exposure effect is in advertising, but research on its effectiveness at enhancing consumer attitudes toward particular companies and products has been mixed. One study tested the mere-exposure effect with banner ads on a computer screen. College-age students were asked to read an article on the computer while banner ads flashed at the top of the screen. The results showed that the students exposed to the &quot;test&quot; banner rated the ad more favorably than other ads shown less frequently or not at all. This research supports the mere-exposure effect.

A different study showed that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about a large number of associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An &quot;optimal&quot; level of exposure to an advertisement may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers was primed with a happy face before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. Those primed with the happy face bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc&#x27;s claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they &quot;like&quot; instead of what they have substantially thought about.

In the advertising world, the mere-exposure effect suggests that consumers need not think about advertisements: simple repetition is enough to make a &quot;memory trace&quot; in the consumer&#x27;s mind and unconsciously affect their consuming behavior. One scholar explained this relationship as follows: &quot;The approach tendencies created by mere exposure may be preattitudinal in the sense that they do not require the type of deliberate processing that is required to form brand attitude.&quot;

===Other areas===
The mere-exposure effect exists in most areas of human decision-making. For example, many stock traders tend to invest in securities of domestic companies merely because they are more familiar with them, even though international markets offer similar or better alternatives. The mere-exposure effect also distorts the results of journal-ranking surveys; academics who previously published or completed reviews for a particular academic journal rate it dramatically higher than those who did not. There are mixed results on the question of whether mere exposure can promote good relations between different social groups. When groups already have negative attitudes to each other, further exposure can increase hostility. A statistical analysis of voting patterns found that candidates&#x27; exposure has a strong effect on the number of votes they receive, distinct from the popularity of their policies.

<text>Archduke Joseph August Viktor Klemens Maria of Austria, Prince of Hungary and Bohemia (9 August 1872 – 6 July 1962) was a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) of the Austro-Hungarian Army and for a short period head of state of Hungary. He was a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, the eldest son of Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria (1833–1905) and his wife Princess Clotilde of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1846–1927). Joseph August&#x27;s grandfather had been Palatine Joseph of Hungary (1776–1847), Palatine and Viceroy of Hungary, a younger son of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor.

The Archduke Joseph Diamond, a 76.02 carat colourless diamond with internal flawless clarity, is named after the Archduke and officially recorded as his property.

==Early life==
August was born at Alcsút, Kingdom of Hungary. On 15 November 1893, in Munich, he married Princess Auguste Maria of Bavaria (1877–1964), daughter of Prince Leopold of Bavaria (1846–1930) and his wife Archduchess Gisela of Austria (1856–1932).

Archduke Joseph August became thus from 1893 grandson-in-law to Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I. His wife&#x27;s mother, Archduchess Gisela, was the eldest surviving daughter of Francis Joseph and Empress Elisabeth (&quot;Sisi&quot;). The young couple&#x27;s children were born in their great-grandfather&#x27;s lifetime.

They had six children:
*Archduke Joseph Francis of Austria, born on 28 March 1895; died on 
*Archduchess Gisela Auguste Anna Maria, born on 5 July 1897; died on 
*Archduchess Sophie Klementine Elisabeth Klothilde Maria, born on 11 March 1899; died on 
*Archduke Ladislaus Luitpold, born on 3 January 1901; died on 
*Archduke Matthias Joseph Albrecht Anton Ignatius, born on 26 June 1904; died on 
*Archduchess Magdalena Maria Raineria, born on 6 September 1909; died on 

Joseph August began his military career in 1890 when he was commissioned into the 1st Infantry Regiment as a Leutnant. He was soon promoted to Oberleutnant and was transferred to 72nd Infantry Regiment in 1893. He was transferred to Dragoon Regiment #6 in 1894 and then transferred to the 1st Royal Hungarian Honvéd Hussars by the emperor and promoted to the rank of Major. He took command of this regiment in 1904 and then went on to command 79th Honvéd infantry brigade in 1908 then finally the 31st infantry division at Budapest in 1911.

==World War I==

In 1914, he was involved in combat in the Galician theatre and took command of the VII Corps and was involved in fighting in the Carpathian Mountains for which he was awarded, among others, the Austrian Order of Leopold and the Prussian Iron Cross. After Italy became involved in the war, he was transferred to the Carinthian border and involved in fighting the Isonzo army. August remained on the front until the Ninth Battle of the Isonzo in 1916, a period in which once again he was highly decorated. Joseph August was highly popular among his troops, especially those of Hungarian nationality.

In November 1916, Joseph August was put in command of the &quot;Heeresfront&quot; fighting against Russian and Romanian forces, and in 1917, he was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa and the Pour le Mérite. In January 1918 he was put in command of the 6th Army in the Southern theatre and that July took over the South Tyrolean Army Group, which was the 10th and the 11th Armies. Finally, on 26 October 1918, he was sent to the Balkans theatre to take command of the &quot;Heeresgruppe Kövess&quot;, which had lost Serbia, Albania and Montenegro. He was the last person to be appointed a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) of the Austro-Hungarian Army on 24 October 1918 as an attempt by his cousin, Emperor Charles I to placate Hungarian nationalists.

==Later life==
On 27 October 1918, Emperor Charles made August the &quot;Homo Regius&quot; of Hungary, but August asked to be released from his oath of allegiance to the emperor. He then began negotiations and appointed Count János Hadik to build a new national government. However, the Aster Revolution broke out on 31 October 1918, deterring his plans. In November, the socialist Hungarian Democratic Republic was proclaimed, only to be replaced a few months later by the communist Hungarian Soviet Republic. The revolution failed; the popular Joseph August survived unharmed; and on 7 August, he became head of state of Hungary once again, officially as regent &quot;(Reichsverweser)&quot; for Charles. He appointed István Friedrich as Prime Minister. When it became apparent that the Allies would not recognise a Habsburg as Hungary&#x27;s head of state, Joseph August was forced to resign on 23 August 1919.

In 1920 the Archduke became the first knight of the Hungarian Order of Vitéz, in 1927 he became a member of the newly re-established House of Magnates. He later became an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and was its president from 1936–1944. He fled Hungary for the United States in 1944 but later returned to West Germany. In 1957, at the death of the Former regent of Hungary, Miklos Horthy, he became the Captain General of the Order of Vitéz. He died in 1962 at Rain, near Straubing.

==Children==
His eldest son, Archduke Joseph Francis of Austria, had predeceased him, dying in 1957.

Thus, Joseph August&#x27;s main heir was his eldest grandson, Archduke Joseph Árpád of Austria (1933–2017), the eldest son of Joseph Francis and his wife, Princess Anna of Saxony. Joseph Árpád married Princess Maria of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, and had children in Joseph August&#x27;s lifetime. His surviving eldest son is Archduke Joseph Karl (born 1960).

August&#x27;s granddaughter Archduchess Ilona of Austria (1927–2011) married George Alexander, Duke of Mecklenburg. Her son George Borwin, Duke of Mecklenburg is the current head of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:

==History==
Joseph Davis State Park was originally known as Lower Niagara State Park when it first opened in 1964. The park was formed from a parcel of land purchased by New York State in 1961. An additional of land was added to the park in 1969, just before the decision to rename the park in honor of Joseph Davis in 1970. Davis was a former president of the Niagara Frontier State Parks Commission, serving from 1948 to 1969.

In 2005, the park was featured in the eighth installment of the reality competition series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; as the Finish Line for the &quot;Race&quot;.

Since 2011, the park has been operated by the Town of Lewiston in partnership with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

==Park description==
Joseph Davis State Park includes trails for hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling, in addition to facilitating access for anglers to fish the Niagara River or several ponds within the park. The park also includes a free 27-hole disc golf course.

A bird conservation area has also been established within the park, including riverfront land, wetlands, and successional shrubland. The conservation area&#x27;s primary purpose is to provide habitat and feeding areas for songbirds that utilize river corridors during their annual migrations.

<doc id="547880" wikidata="Q77139" url="?curid=547880" title="Robert Ritter von Greim">
<text>Robert &quot;Ritter&quot; von Greim (born Robert Greim; 22 June 1892 – 24 May 1945) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field marshal) and First World War flying ace. In April 1945, in the last days of World War II in Europe, Adolf Hitler appointed Greim commander-in-chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German air force) after Hermann Göring had been dismissed for treason. He was the last person to have been promoted to field marshal in the German armed forces. After the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945, Greim was captured by the Allies. He committed suicide in an American-controlled prison on 24 May 1945.

==Early life and career==
He was born as Robert Greim on 22 June 1892 in Bayreuth in the Kingdom of Bavaria, a state of the German Empire, the second son of police &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Ludwig Greim and his wife Marie. Greim had an older brother Ludwig, named after his father, born 5 October 1888, and a younger sister Marie Barbara born 11 January 1911. From 18 September 1906 to 6 July 1911, Greim attended the () on the Marsfeld in Munich and graduated with his &quot;Abitur&quot; (university entry qualification).

Greim joined the Bavarian Army on 14 July 1911. During his officer training, he was posted to the (), a field artillery regiment of the 6th Royal Bavarian Division on 25 February 1913. Greim received his officer training at the War Academy () in Munich. On 28 October 1913, Greim was commissioned as a &quot;Leutnant&quot; (second lieutenant). In April 1914, he received the Bavarian Military Merit Order 4th Class () for service with the ammunition column of 1st battalion of his 8th Field Artillery Regiment.

==World War I==
When World War I started in August 1914, Greim&#x27;s regiment was subordinated to the 6th Army under its commander-in-chief &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria. Greim, who commanded a battery during the Battle of Lorraine, distinguished himself on 25 August in the fighting near Maixe-Deuxville. The 8th Field Artillery Regiment stayed in the combat area of Nancy until 24 September and then relocated to Saint-Mihiel. During combat in the Bois d&#x27;Ailly (Ailly Wood), Greim earned the Iron Cross 2nd Class () in November 1914. On 9 March 1915, Greim became an adjutant with the 1st battalion of the 8th Field Artillery Regiment. That day, he made his maiden flight as a passenger. The flight took him across the front between Saint-Mihiel and Flirey and then to the northern outskirts of Toul, approximately behind enemy lines where Greim observed the 26 French artillery positions between Saint-Mihiel and Pont-à-Mousson. During this aerial reconnaissance flight, Greim took detailed notes of his observations. On 10 August, Greim began his training as an aerial observer with the &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; 3b (FFA 3b—Field Flying Company 3b).

===With the German Air Service===

On 10 October 1915, while flying as an aerial observer on a Albatros C.I, Greim shot down a Farman MF.11 from French Escadrille Spa.69. The Farman crashed near Deuxnouds, killing Sergeant Henri Mahien and Lieutenant Henri Mérillion. On 16 October, &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Hermann Pohl, the commanding officer of FFA 3b, sent a telegram to the III Royal Bavarian Corps (III. &quot;Königlich Bayerisches Armee-Korps&quot;), requesting Greim&#x27;s official transfer to the FFA 3b. The request was approved on 28 October and Greim became a member of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (German Air Service).

On 22 June 1916, Greim&#x27;s pilot &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Alois Hosp died of wounds in a field hospital. He was shot down and wounded by &quot;Sous-Lieutenant&quot; Charles Nungesser. On 3 August, Greim was transferred to the &quot;Artillerieflieger-Abteilung&quot; 204 (AFA 204—Artillery Flying Company 204) which was based at an airfield near Ruyaulcourt.

He also served with AFA 204 over the Somme. Greim was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (First Lieutenant) on 17 January 1917. After undergoing pilot training, Greim joined FA 46b on 22 February 1917.

===As a fighter pilot===
He transferred to &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; 34 (Jasta 34—34th Fighter Squadron) in April 1917. He scored an aerial victory on 25 May 1917, and on the same day he received the Iron Cross 1st Class (). 

On 19 June, he was given command of Jasta 34. Greim became an ace on 16 August 1917, when he shot down a Sopwith 1½ Strutter. By 16 October, his victory tally totaled seven. There was a lull in his successes until February 1918. On the 11th, he had an unconfirmed victory and on the 18th he claimed aerial victory number eight.

On 21 March 1918, the day of his ninth credited victory, Greim became Commanding Officer of &quot;Jagdgruppe&quot; 10. He flew with them until at least 18 June, when he notched up his 15th success. On 27 June 1918, while Greim was engaging a Bristol Fighter, his aircraft lost its cowling. The departing cowling damaged his top wing, along with the lower left interplane strut, but Greim managed to land the machine successfully. By 7 August 1918 he was commanding &quot;Jagdgruppe&quot; 9, and scored his 16th victory. On 23 August, he cooperated with &quot;Vizefeldwebel&quot; Johann Pütz in what was arguably the first successful assault by aircraft on armored tanks. On 27 September, he scored kill number 25 while flying with &quot;Jagdgruppe&quot; 9.

He returned to Jasta 34 in October 1918. The Jasta had been re-equipped with &#x27;cast-offs&#x27; from Richthofen&#x27;s Flying Circus, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; I. The new equipment was warmly welcomed as being superior to the older Albatros and Pfalz fighters that they had been previously equipped with. Greim&#x27;s final three victories came during this time, while he was flying Albatros D.Vs, Fokker Triplanes, and Fokker D.VIIs. By the war&#x27;s end he had scored 28 victories and had been awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; on 8 October. On 23 November 1920, Greim was also awarded the Bavarian Military Order of Max Joseph (), this award made him a knight (&quot;Ritter&quot;), and allowed him to add both this honorific title and the style &#x27;von&#x27; to his name. Thus Robert Greim became Robert Ritter von Greim.

==Interwar period==
By 1919, Greim had returned to Bavaria and rejoined his regiment (8th Bavarian Artillery) and was discharged from the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; on 31 March 1920 holding the rank of &quot;Hauptmann&quot;. He then enrolled in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he studied jurisprudence and rekindled his relationship with Rudolf Heß. Heß was also a student in Munich and a former pilot during World War I who had occasionally flown under the command of Greim while both their units were based at Gosselies. On 2 September 1920, Greim married Alice Wilhelmine Adelheid Braun, née Landauer. Alice was six years older than Greim and the widow of &quot;Leutnant&quot; Hanns Braun, a pilot in Greim&#x27;s unit who was killed in action on 9 October 1918 and an Olympic medalist. On 1 July 1921, their mutual son Hubert was born. Alice had brought two daughters, Gisela and Sascha, into the marriage. Hubert would later marry Johann Raithel&#x27;s daughter Anneliese.

For 10 months, he ran the air postal station in Munich. This was the key turning point in his career, as in 1920 he flew the up-and-coming German army propaganda instructor Adolf Hitler to Berlin as an observer of the failed Kapp Putsch. Many other people from Hitler&#x27;s years in Bavaria immediately after World War I also rose to prominence in the Nazi era.

Upon his return to Germany, Greim took part in the 1923 putsch; as a convinced Nazi, he &quot;remained utterly committed to Hitler to the very end of the war&quot;.

===In China===
In 1924, Greim, together with Richard Walter, Robert Heibert and Werner Charlottenburg, was recruited by the Chiang Kai-shek government to help build a Chinese air force in Canton initially led by Sun Yat-sen. Traveling by ship on the SS &quot;Trier&quot;, the pilots arrived in Hong Kong on 13 September. The Soviet Union had also sent military advisers to China, among them Vasily Blyukher and Konstantin Rokossovsky whom Greim befriended during his stay in China. Around the turn of the year 1925/26, his wife Alice and son Hubert joined Greim in Canton, making the journey on the SS &quot;Coblenz&quot;.

In early April 1927, Greim and his family left Canton, taking the Trans–Siberian Railway via Harbin, Moscow and Warsaw, arriving in Munich on 1 May 1927. In Moscow, Greim failed to help a longtime school and war friend, Josef Römer, with establishing contact to the Soviets. Römer, who was a communist and member of the German resistance to Nazism, was later imprisoned in 1934 in the Dachau concentration camp. In 1939, Greim was instrumental in getting Römer released from prison. When Römer was again arrested and tried before the People&#x27;s Court () on 19 June 1944, Greim was unable to help further, Römer was sentenced to death and executed on 25 September 1944.

===Nazism===
In 1933, Hermann Göring invited Greim to help him to rebuild the German Air Force. He was appointed to command the first fighter pilot school, following the closure of the secret flying school established near the city of Lipetsk in the Soviet Union during the closing days of the Weimar Republic. Germany had been forbidden to have an air force under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, so it trained its pilots in secret.

On 1 January 1934, Greim joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and was promoted to &quot;Major&quot; (major) that day. Organizationally, he was assigned to both the (), which was subordinated to the 7th Division, and to the &quot;Flieger-Inspektion&quot; 3 (3rd Flyer Inspection) of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM—Ministry of Aviation). On 1 May, he was given command of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 132 &quot;Richthofen&quot; (JG 132—132nd Fighter Wing), based in Döberitz, a fighter group named after Manfred von Richthofen. The unit was also known under its cover name &quot;Reklamestaffel Mitteldeutschland&quot; (Advertisement Squadron Middle Germany). He held this position until 1 April 1935 when he was appointed &quot;Inspekteur der Jagdflieger&quot; (Inspector of Fighters). Command of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of JG 132 was then passed on to &quot;Major&quot; Kurt-Bertram von Döring.

On 14 June 1935, Greim visited the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (German Institute for Glider Research) based at the Griesheim Airfield near Darmstadt. He inspected and tested a prototype glider leading to the development of the DFS 230 transport glider. That day, he for the first time met the then 23 year old test pilot Hanna Reitsch. On 9 September, Greim traveled on LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; to Brazil, arriving in Recife on 12 September. There, together with his former World War I comrade Johann Pütz, they made multiple flights on a Junkers Ju 52 to São Pedro da Aldeia and Santos. The reasons for his journey remain unclear. He returned to Germany on 2 October, arriving at Friedrichshafen Airfiled on LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;.

On 1 February 1938, Greim was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (—brigadier general). In 1938, Greim assumed command of the Luftwaffe research department.

==World War II==
After the end of the Polish campaign, von Greim became commander of the 5th &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; (5th Air Corps) which participated in the Battle of Britain. Greim was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; (—major general) on 1 January 1940 and to &quot;General der Flieger&quot; (general of the aviators) on 19 July.

In 1941, on the Eastern Front, his corps split up and renamed &quot;Sonderstab Krim&quot;. In April 1942 he became commander of &quot;Luftwaffenkommando Ost&quot; in Smolensk, as his korps replaced the 8th Fliegerkorps in the front area there. In February 1943, von Greim was given command of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 6, which continued to support Army Group Centre in its operations. As part of Operation Citadel, von Greim&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; provided 730 aircraft in July 1943. Due to high losses, by June 1944 only around 50 aircraft were operational.

On 30 December 1942, his son Hubert was taken prisoner of war. Hubert was a fighter pilot in &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Julius Meimberg&#x27;s 11. &quot;Staffel&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot; serving in North Africa. He made a forced landing in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-4 trop (&quot;Werknummer&quot; 16069—factory number) near Tabarka and Aïn Draham when his aircraft had been hit by anti-aircraft artillery.

===Berlin, April 1945===
As late as January 1945, von Greim made a commitment to Hitler: &quot;I who believed in the &quot;Führer&quot; – and damn it, still believe in him. I can not become a traitor. Not me!&quot;

On 24 April 1945, &quot;Oberst&quot; Nicolaus von Below implemented Hitler&#x27;s order and instructed Greim to immediately travel to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; in Berlin. At 23:45 that day, Greim called &quot;General der Flieger&quot; Karl Koller, the Chief of the Luftwaffe General Staff, requesting information about the situation in Berlin. Koller, who had additional information to share, did not want to talk over the phone. At 11:00 on 25 April, Greim and Koller met in person and Greim was informed about the deteriorating situation around Hitler. Greim then picked up Hanna Reitsch from Schloss Leopoldskron before the two took a Junkers Ju 188 from Neubiberg Airfield to Rechlin.

With Berlin encircled by Soviet forces during the Battle of Berlin, Greim flew into Berlin from Rechlin with Reitsch, in response to Hitler&#x27;s order. Initially they flew from the central Luftwaffe test facility airfield, the &quot;Erprobungsstelle Rechlin&quot; to Gatow (a district of south-western Berlin) in a Focke-Wulf Fw 190. As the cockpit had room for only the pilot, Reitsch flew in the tail of the plane, getting into it by climbing through a small emergency opening. The flight was escorted by twelve other Fw 190s from &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 26 under the command of Hans Dortenmann.

Having landed in Gatow, they changed planes to fly to the Chancellery; however, their Fieseler Storch was hit by anti-aircraft fire over the Grunewald. Greim was incapacitated by a bullet in the right foot, but Reitsch was able to reach the throttle and joystick to land on an improvised air strip in the Tiergarten, near the Brandenburg Gate.

They drove directly to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, where Greim&#x27;s wound was dressed. Then Hitler promoted Greim from &quot;Generaloberst&quot; to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal), making him the last German officer ever to achieve that rank and appointed him as commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, to replace Hermann Göring, whom he had recently dismissed &quot;in absentia&quot; for treason. Greim thus became the second man to command the German Air Force during the Third Reich. However, with the end of the war in Europe fast approaching, his tenure as &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe&quot; lasted only a few days.

On 28 April, Hitler ordered Ritter von Greim to leave Berlin and had Reitsch fly him to Plön, so that he could arrest Heinrich Himmler on the charge of treason. That night, the two left Berlin, taking off from the Tiergarten air strip in a small Arado Ar 96 aircraft. Soldiers of the Soviet 3rd Shock Army feared they had just seen Hitler escape. In a post-war interview, Reitsch said, &quot;It was the blackest day when we could not die at our Führer&#x27;s side.&quot;

==Death==

On 8 May, the same day as the surrender of Germany, Greim was captured by American troops in Austria. His initial statement to his captors was reportedly &quot;I am the head of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, but I have no &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&quot;. Greim committed suicide in prison in Salzburg on 24 May.

<text>The Messerschmitt Me 323 &quot;Gigant&quot; (&quot;Giant&quot;) was a German military transport aircraft of World War II. It was a powered variant of the Me 321 military glider and was the largest land-based transport aircraft to fly during the war. In total, 213 were made, with 15 being converted from the Me 321.

==Development==

The Me 323 was the result of a 1940 German requirement for a large assault glider in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, the projected invasion of Great Britain. The DFS 230 light glider had already proven its worth in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium (the first ever assault by gliderborne troops), and would later be used in the invasion of Crete in 1941.

However, in order to mount an invasion across the English Channel, the Germans would need to be able to airlift vehicles and other heavy equipment as part of an initial assault wave. Although Operation Sea Lion was cancelled, the requirement for a heavy air transport capability remained, with the focus shifting to the forthcoming Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.

On 18 October 1940, Junkers and Messerschmitt were given just 14 days to submit a proposal for a large transport glider. The emphasis was still very much on the assault role; the ambitious requirement was to be able to carry either an 88 mm gun and its half-track tractor, or a Panzer IV medium tank. The Junkers Ju 322 &quot;Mammut&quot; reached prototype form, but was eventually scrapped due to difficulties in procuring the necessary high-grade timber for its all-wood construction, and as was discovered during the &quot;Mammuts first test flight, an unacceptably high degree of instability inherent in the design. The proposed Messerschmitt aircraft was originally designated Me 261w—partly borrowing the designation of the long-range Messerschmitt Me 261—then changed to Me 263 (later reused for Messerschmitt&#x27;s improved rocket fighter design), and eventually became the Me 321&quot;&#x27;. Although the Me 321 saw considerable service on the Eastern Front as a transport, it was never used for its intended role as an assault glider.

===Me 323===
Early in 1941, as a result of feedback from Transport Command pilots in Russia, the decision was taken to produce a motorized variant of the Me 321, to be designated Me 323. French Gnome et Rhône GR14N radial engines, rated at 1,180 PS (1,164 hp, 868 kW) for take-off as used in the Bloch MB.175 aircraft were chosen for use. This would reduce the burden on Germany&#x27;s strained industry.

Initial tests were conducted with four Gnome engines attached to a strengthened Me 321 wing, giving modest speed of – slower than the Ju 52 transport aircraft. A fixed undercarriage was fitted, with four small wheels in a bogie at the front of the aircraft and six larger wheels in two lines of three at each side of the fuselage, partly covered by an aerodynamic fairing. The rear wheels were fitted with pneumatic brakes that could stop the aircraft within .

The four-engined Me 323C was considered a stepping-stone to the six-engined D series. It still required the five-engined Heinkel He 111Z &quot;Zwilling&quot; or the highly dangerous &quot;vic-style&quot; &quot;Troika-Schlepp&quot; formation of three Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters and underwing-mounted Walter HWK 109-500 &quot;Starthilfe&quot; rocket-assisted take-off units to get airborne when fully loaded, but it could return to base under its own power when empty. This was little better than the Me 321, so the V2 prototype became the first to have six engines and flew for the first time in early 1942, becoming the prototype for the D-series aircraft.

To reduce torque, the aircraft was fitted with three counterclockwise rotation engines on the port wing and three clockwise rotation engines on the starboard wing, as seen looking forward from behind each engine - resulting in the propellers rotating &quot;away&quot; from each other at the tops of their arcs.

==Design==
Like the Me 321, the Me 323 had massive, semicantilever, high-mounted wings, which were braced from the fuselage out to the middle of the wing. To reduce weight and save aluminium, much of the wing was made of plywood and fabric, while the fuselage was of metal-tube construction with wooden spars and covered with doped fabric, with heavy bracing in the floor to support the payload.

The &quot;D&quot; series had a crew of five - two pilots, two flight engineers, and a radio operator. Two gunners could also be carried. The flight engineers occupied two small cabins, one in each wing between the inboard and centre engines. The engineers were intended to monitor engine synchronisation and allow the pilot to fly without worrying about engine status, although the pilot could override the engineers&#x27; decisions on engine and propeller control.

Maximum payload was around 12 tonnes, although at that weight, the Walter HWK 109-500 &quot;Starthilfe&quot; rocket-assisted takeoff units used on the Me 321 were required for takeoff. These were mounted beneath the wings outboard of the engines, with the wings having underside fittings to take up to four units. The cargo hold was long, wide and high. Typical loads were one 15 cm sFH 18 heavy field howitzer (5.5 ton) accompanied by its Sd.Kfz. 7 half-track artillery tractor vehicle (11 ton), two 3.6 tonne (4 ton) trucks, 8,700 loaves of bread, an 88 mm &quot;Flak&quot; gun and accessories, 52 drums of fuel (252 L/45 US gal), 130 men, or 60 stretchers.

Some Me 321s were converted to Me 323s, but most were built as six-engined aircraft from the beginning. Early models were fitted with wooden, two-blade propellers, while later versions had metal, three-blade, variable-pitch versions.

The Me 323 had a maximum speed of only at sea level. It was armed with six 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns firing from a dorsal position behind the wings and from the fuselage. They were manned by the extra gunners, radio operator, and engineers.

==Operational history==

By September 1942, Me 323s were being delivered for use in the Tunisian campaign. They entered service in the Mediterranean theatre in November 1942. High losses among Axis shipping required a huge airlift of equipment across the Mediterranean to keep Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps supplied.

On 22 April 1943, a formation of 27 fully loaded Me 323s was being escorted across the Sicilian Straits by Messerschmitt Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 27 when it was intercepted by seven squadrons — Supermarine Spitfires (No. 1 Squadron SAAF) and Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks (No. 7 South African Wing). Of the 27 transports, 16 or 17 were shot down. Three or four P-40s were shot down by the escorts.

A total of 198 Me 323s were built before production ceased in April 1944. Several production versions were built, beginning with the D-1. Later D- and E- versions differed in the choice of power plant and in defensive armament, with improvements in structural strength, total cargo load, and fuel capacity also being implemented. Nonetheless, the Me 323 remained underpowered. A proposal to install six BMW 801 radials did not occur. The Me 323 was also a short-range aircraft, with a typical range (loaded) of 1,000–1,200 km (620–750 mi). Despite this, the limited numbers of Me 323s in service were an asset to the Germans, and saw extensive use.

==Surviving aircraft==
No complete aircraft survives, but the &quot;Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr&quot; (Air Force Museum of the German Federal Armed Forces) in Berlin has a Me 323 main wing spar in its collection.

A ruined but complete wreck was found in 2012, in the sea near La Maddalena, an island near Sardinia, Italy. The aircraft lies in around of water, around from the coast. It was shot down by a British Bristol Beaufighter long-range fighter on 26 July 1943, while flying from Sardinia to Pistoia in Italy.

<text>Robert Moses State Park (Long Island) is a state park in southern Suffolk County, New York. The park lies on the western end of Fire Island, one of the central barrier islands off the southern coast of Long Island, and is known for its stretch of beaches on the Atlantic Ocean. The park is accessible from Long Island by the Robert Moses Causeway across Great South Bay.

Established as Fire Island State Park in 1908, the park is the oldest state park on Long Island. Its current name was given to honor Robert Moses, the influential mid-20th century urban planner and former president of the Long Island State Park Commission. Recently, lawmakers have suggested the park should revert to its previous name or to something that better reflects its location.

==Park description==

Robert Moses State Park includes of beach, which visitors can use for swimming, surfing, or fishing. Anglers may fish from either the beach or the piers. A day use boat basin that can accommodate up to 40 boats is also available. Guests can also use the four bathhouses on the property. The park also contains four concession stands (one at each field), volleyball courts, first aid stations, picnic areas, and a playground at Field 5.

On the west end of the park is an 18-hole pitch and putt golf course. The secluded course is set among native trees and beach vegetation. It is typically open April through November and equipment rental is available.
Robert Moses State Park also facilitates access to the Fire Island National Seashore, immediately east of the park. Since there is no parking at the Seashore itself, many visitors park at Field 5 in order to walk to Lighthouse Beach, the Fire Island Lighthouse and Museum, or the nearby community of Kismet. In 2010, New York State officials estimated about 30% of the users of Field 5 park there to access Lighthouse Beach and the Lighthouse itself. Lighthouse Beach was historically a clothing optional beach; however, the National Park Service has enforced a ban on public nudity at Lighthouse Beach since 2013, citing concerns over increases in lewd behavior prior to the ban. Violators face a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in prison.

===Access and hours===
The park is accessible by automobile from the Robert Moses Causeway, which connects Fire Island with mainland Long Island. Parking is available in four separate fields. Parking fields 2, 4 and 5 have a capacity of roughly 1,000 vehicles while the capacity at Field 3 is 500. Suffolk Transit&#x27;s S47 route also serves the beach seasonally connecting it with the Babylon Long Island Rail Road station on the Babylon Branch.

The park is open year-round from sunrise to sunset, although hours for activities such as swimming and golfing vary by season. Portions of the park are open 24 hours a day to fishermen with the appropriate permit. There are many other permits you can buy, such as nighttime photography, stargazing, 4x4 beach permits, scuba diving, and many more.

Starting in early April, visitors are charged a fee for parking at the park. As of 2024, vehicle fees are $8 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends from early-April until Memorial Day, after which a $10 fee is charged from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidays, and a $10 fee is charged on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. After Labor Day weekend, vehicle fees are once again $8 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends only, until early-November when fees are no longer charged.

==History==

The west end of Fire Island was part of a colonial grant to William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith. In 1825 the federal government acquired the westerly tip to build a lighthouse and David Sammis bought about to the east in 1855 and built the Surf Hotel.

In 1892, fears of a cholera epidemic spread by passengers on ships arriving in New York prompted the state to acquire the hotel property to establish a quarantine station. Irate local citizens obtained an injunction blocking the quarantine station and occupied the site despite the arrival of troops.

In 1908, Governor Charles Evans Hughes signed legislation designating the former Surf Hotel property as Long Island&#x27;s first state park, known then as Fire Island State Park. The island and the park have grown since that time; for decades, sand has accumulated along Fire Island&#x27;s western tip at a rate of per year, increasing the island&#x27;s length by since 1825. At the time of the park&#x27;s establishment, the island&#x27;s western tip was near where the park&#x27;s water tower stands today.

A 1918 fire destroyed the boardwalk and the few buildings on the site. In 1924, the state established the Long Island State Park Commission headed by Robert Moses as part of a statewide park and parkway program, also run by Moses. The commission obtained from the federal government of beach west of the lighthouse that had been formed by shifting sand. In 1926 the first bathhouse was erected.

After the hurricane of 1938 devastated the park, the commission decided to rebuild farther east near the lighthouse, and sand was pumped onto the beach to raise a portion of the island to a height of above sea level. In 1940, the first modern bathhouse opened to the public, replacing facilities destroyed by the hurricane.
Ferry service was maintained from Babylon to the park until 1964 when the Robert Moses Causeway opened. The park was renamed for Moses that same year. Attendance boomed, and three parking fields with bathhouses were added.

Robert Moses State Park celebrated its 100th anniversary on June 27, 2008. The anniversary coincided with the completion of several improvements at the park, including a $700,000 rehabilitation of the bathhouse at Field 3. The renovation improved and expanded bathroom facilities, repaired the park&#x27;s cupola and clock, and replaced a glass and metal storefront added to the building in the 1980s with a new exterior consistent with the building&#x27;s original architecture. The renovations were part of $132 million in improvements for New York&#x27;s state parks and historic sites enacted in 2008.

In 2013, a $7.7 million dredging and beach restoration project was conducted to replenish beaches damaged during Hurricane Sandy. The project used about of sand removed during dredging of the Captree State Park boat canal to restore beaches at Robert Moses State Park.

A $1.7 million project to increase energy efficiency and install a 500-kilowatt solar photovoltaic power system at the park was announced in 2015. The planned improvements aim to make Robert Moses State Park the first energy-neutral state park in the United States.

In 2019 a proposal was made by Manhattanville representative Daniel J. O&#x27;Donnell to rename Robert Moses State Park in the light of a re-evaluation of the history of Long Island and the legacy of Robert Moses. The bill did not include a proposal for a new name. In February 2021 the bill progressed on to the New York State Assembly calendar, where as of December 2021 it still sits.

As of 2014, the facility attracts approximately 3.5 million visitors per year.

<doc id="547887" wikidata="Q5326140" url="?curid=547887" title="Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park">
<text>Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park (or Earl W. Brydges State Artpark) is a state park located in the Village of Lewiston in Niagara County, New York. The park, which is officially named after former New York State Senator Earl Brydges, is generally referred to as Artpark. 

The Earl W. Brydges Artpark programs are managed by Artpark &amp; Company, Inc for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historical Preservation under a Cooperative Agreement. Artpark &amp; Company is a not-for-profit 501c3 Arts and Education organization which serves the people of Western New York and Southern Ontario. 

Today Artpark programming attracts over 150,000 audiences over the course of its summer season (June-August) and serves a population of approximately 1.2 million Western New Yorkers and over 1 million Canadian residents. Over the course of its 50-year history, over 2.5 million persons have attended musical and theater performances at Artpark.

The park overlooks the Niagara Gorge.

The park is 1 of 80 New York State Parks that are in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with the park experiencing 3 minutes and 25 seconds of totality.

==Park description==
The park is a venue for summer musical entertainment, in addition to offering picnic tables and pavilions, fishing, hiking, nature trail, a performing arts theater, recreation programs. Also located on the property is the Lewiston Mound, an archaeological site on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Land art==
Artpark was founded in 1974, one year after Robert Smithson&#x27;s death, and had an artist&#x27;s residency program in his honor. The park, created on the site of a former industrial waste dump, became an important site for works of the land art movement. It was the site of Alan Sonfist&#x27;s &quot;Pool of Virgin Earth&quot;, a clay basin for catching aerial seeds, and projects by several women artists in the 1970s, including Michelle Stuart, Alice Adams and Agnes Denes and Nancy Holt. It continued to be an important laboratory for outdoor sculpture, with over 200 artists and collectives creating art and installations at the site between 1974 and 1984.

===Selected visual art at Artpark===
Installations at Artpark were intended to be temporary. Works created at the park included:

==Performance venues==
The facility features an Amphitheater venue, a Mainstage venue, and gathering, vending, and services areas. The Amphitheater consists of an outdoor stage with seating for up to 10,000 viewers in the front-of-stage viewing area, tiered lawn sections for general seating and reserved seating, and a fabric-covered terrace for sponsored seating. The Mainstage consists of an enclosed performance stage with fly house, orchestra pit, and back of house service areas, reserved seating sections accommodating up to 2400 viewers, outdoor terrace and balcony areas for gatherings and events. The enclosure is opened along the back wall to a lawn area used for general seating for up to 2000 viewers. The Amphitheater holds musical performance on a weekly basis throughout the performance season. The Mainstage presents a number of musical and theatrical performances, presentations, school graduations, and other events during the performance season. In 2017, Artpark was qualified for the Empire State Musical &amp; Theatrical Tax Credit Program and in 2020 as the Qualified Film Production Facility accreditation by the Office of Motion Picture &amp; Television Development.

<text>Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (Thai: สถาบันเทคโนโลยีนานาชาติสิรินธร) (SIIT) is a semi-autonomous institute of technology established in 1992 within Thammasat University. It is located in Pathum Thani, Thailand. One of Thailand&#x27;s research universities, it offers science, technology and engineering education, as well as related management programs. All are international programs, with English language as a medium of instruction. The institute is part of the Links to Asia by Organizing Traineeship and Student Exchange network, an international consortium of universities in Europe and Asia.

Although it is an academic unit of Thammasat University and its graduates receive Thammasat University degrees, the institute is self-administered and self-financed.

Since it is a research-focused academic institution, the academic year 2003 performance evaluation showed has the highest number of research publications (both in raw quantity and per graduate student heads) of any academic division in the university. In addition, a 2007 assessment of research publications by Thailand Research Fund put SIIT at the top of all engineering faculties in the kingdom in terms of equivalent international journal papers per faculty member and in terms of impact factor per faculty member.
==History==
During the ninth Japan-Thailand Joint Trade and Economic Committee Meeting held in Kobe, Japan in 1989, all the delegates from the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) and the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) realized that to enhance industrial development of Thailand, engineers with working knowledge of English are needed. Therefore, it was recommended that engineering programs, where all lecture and laboratory courses would be taught in English by highly qualified faculty members with doctoral degrees, be established.

A cooperation agreement among Keidanren, FTI, and Thammasat University was reached in 1992 to establish bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in engineering at Thammasat University with initial funds provided by Keidanren and FTI. After two years of operation, the International Institute of Technology (IIT) was founded on 16 September 1994. Maha Chakri Sirindhorn presided over the cornerstone-laying ceremony of a new building at the Rangsit Center of Thammasat University using part of the initial fund. Then, on 28 June 1996, King Bhumibol Adulyadej granted the institute a new name: Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT). On 2 October 1997, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn presided over the inauguration ceremony of its name and building. In June 2001, former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun inaugurated a new campus at Bangkadi Industrial Park.

== Administrative independence ==
Although it is a unit of Thammasat University, SIIT is financially and administratively separate from the central university system. SIIT&#x27;s policies and operations are guided and supervised by the Board of Trustees which consists of representatives from Thammasat University, FTI, Nippon Keidanren, and scholars appointed by the university. In addition, the Academic Review Committee (ARC) provides guidance and recommendations on academic and research matters. The institute, headed by the director, consists of four administrative divisions, a library, and information services center, and six academic schools, with 15 academic programs.

As the institute is an autonomous (semi-private) body of Thammasat University, it gets no funding from the state and needs to find and manage its own income and spending. To start its operation, the institute received initial funds from Keidanren and FTI. Parts of funding are research grants and scholarships from international organizations like Asian Development Bank, local ones like industries, and the Thailand Research Fund, and individual contributions. The rest of funding is from tuition fees.

==Academics==
All faculty members are doctoral degree holders, with strong research and/or industrial experiences. The institute is considered among academic peers as a research intensive engineering school. On average, each year each SIIT faculty member produces twice the highest value of national range for international journal publications (0.74 vs 0–0.41).

In 2007, the Thailand Research Fund assessed research outcomes of universities in Thailand, and SIIT ranked as &quot;very good&quot; for all three indicators, making it the only engineering school in the country to achieve this.

As few prospective students can afford considerably higher tuition fees, the institute initially faced difficulty recruiting undergraduate students with high test scores. While scholarships and special recruitment programs do help attract many bright students, its average admission scores are unacceptably low compared to other science and engineering programs in the country. Due to the lower admission scores, the school is comparatively easy to enroll in. The average admission score of admitted students is among the lowest among engineering students. However, most of the low-performance students will be disqualified. The unqualified or unsatisfied academic competency students will be expelled within a first or second year which occurred about 50% of entry students.

The undergraduate recruitment situation is improving, especially for its computer, IT, and management-related majors, which now have higher average admission scores. With its strong science and technology education, the institute has been selected, along with Mahidol University and Chulalongkorn University, by Thailand National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), as a destination of selected group of top students from Mahidol Wittayanusorn School and 12 Princess Chulaporn Schools for Science, the country&#x27;s science schools for gifted students, in a program to mentor junior researchers for national science and technology development.

For its graduate levels, the institute attracts bright graduates, as the institute gains supports from many national and international bodies (and use that as scholarships for graduate students). SIIT is one of a very small number of universities that can secure numbers of Thailand Research Fund&#x27;s Royal Golden Jubilee grants, considered to be the country&#x27;s most prestigious research grants for PhD students, for every single year since the program began in 1998 — one of the only three that can secure engineering discipline grants that often.

===Schools===
A number of undergraduate and research-based graduate programs are offered from five schools and one department.
; School of Bio-Chemical Engineering and Technology : hosts Chemical Engineering programs
; School of Civil Engineering and Technology : hosts Civil Engineering programs
; School of Information, Computer and Communication Technology : hosts Computer Engineering, Digital Engineering, and Electrical Engineering programs
; School of Management Technology: hosts Business and Supply Chain Analytics program
; School of Manufacturing Systems and Mechanical Engineering : hosts Industrial Engineering and Logistics Systems, and Mechanical Engineering programs
; School of Integrated Science and Innovation

==Cooperations==
The institute enjoys a strong link with many universities, remarkably with its neighbor Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) and a group of Japanese universities and research centers, as well as a network of European universities such as DAAD International Quality Network (IQN) program and LAOTSE network. Locally, a remarkable collaborative network is the Joint Graduate School of Energy and Environment, a group of leading Thai universities in environmental and energy technology area.

The institute established faculty member and student exchange programs, as well as internship programs, with universities and organizations in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. These programs allow faculty members to collaborate with their counterparts in research projects, and students to have an opportunity to take engineering courses at these universities. Additionally, qualified foreign professors are regularly invited to visit and conduct courses at SIIT.

Because of their proximity, SIIT, Thammasat University, AIT, Thailand Science Park, and research centers of NSTDA, share some of their facilities, including libraries and laboratories, with each other. In 1998, the Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (TGIST) was established by NSTDA to further strengthen its collaboration with academics and industries; SIIT is among three major academic institutes in TGIST&#x27;s &quot;Thailand Science Park Collaboration&quot;.

In 2007, SIIT joined NSTDA, King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, and Tokyo Institute of Technology as founding members in the establishment of Thailand Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. This joint graduate school will offer international postgraduate degrees, where faculty staffs will come from Tokyo Tech, NSTDA, and Thai universities.

==Campuses==
Operations of SIIT are carried out at two locations: Thammasat University&#x27;s Rangsit Center and Bangkadi, both in Pathum Thani, surrounded by many national research centers, high-tech industrial parks, and universities, as well as Thailand Science Park and National Science Museum. The area is now known as the &quot;Technology Cluster of North Bangkok&quot;.

===Rangsit Campus===
The Rangsit Campus is situated in the TU&#x27;s Rangsit Center, approximately 42 kilometers north of Bangkok, just next to the Asian Institute of Technology and Thailand Science Park. The center served as the main host for the 13th Asian Games in 1998 and the World University Games in 2007.

===Bangkadi Campus===
Located in Bangkadi Industrial Park, the Bangkadi Campus is about 15 kilometers away southeast from the Rangsit Campus. The information technology program moved to this facility in June 2002. The management technology and the telecommunications programs moved to Bangkadi in May 2003. It houses all new ICT-related programs, for example, the computer science program. In June 2006, the new building Sirindhralai (Thai: สิรินธราลัย), the name graciously granted by Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, was opened to accommodate the telecommunications, engineering management, and management technology programs.

== Research Centers and Units ==

<text>Engineers Without Borders Canada (EWB; , ISF) is a non-governmental organization devoted to international development. Founded in 2000 by George Roter and Parker Mitchell, engineering graduates from the University of Waterloo, it is a registered Canadian charity focused on finding solutions to extreme poverty, specifically in rural Africa. The group has chapters at universities across Canada, and regional chapters aimed at professionals in several major cities.

EWB Canada has no direct affiliations with similarly named organizations in the rest of the world, although it does collaborate with them from time to time.

==Operations==
===In Canada===
In Canada, EWB Canada engages in numerous educational and public outreach activities in Canada including educating high school students about international development issues via the School Outreach program, enhancing curricula at some universities by developing assignments or courses for engineering students, and informing the Canadian public on global development issues. EWB Canada also works in advocacy campaigns aimed convincing the Canadian government to change policies and laws concerning international development issues. This is done through letter writing and meeting with politicians, among other means. Unknown to many, EWB Canada played a large role in the Canadian Live 8 concert in 2005 and has won numerous awards both nationally and internationally. 
EWB Canada is a young, rapidly growing student-driven organization based on university chapters across Canada, with a national office in Toronto to support the university chapters and to co-ordinate and train overseas volunteers. As of January 2009 there are 26 university chapters, 7 professional chapters and more than 35,000 members nationwide. Paid staff is kept to a minimum in the organization, in order to run the organization as efficiently as possible; all positions outside the national office are volunteer. The members are primarily engineering students, although a number of non-engineering students are active members and have volunteered overseas.

There is an annual EWB Canada national conference every year in late January which is currently the largest international development conference in Canada. Its location varies from year to year depending on the chapter hosting it.

To raise money, EWB Canada created the Run to End Poverty (R2EP) national movement in 2009. Since its inception, it has had more than 50 events, in 18 different cities, raising over $600,000. These events are organized entirely by their volunteer base, engaging close to a thousand runners each year from coast-to-coast. The goal of the initiative is to eliminate extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

===Overseas===

EWB works overseas (primarily in sub-Saharan Africa) with local NGOs and, occasionally, government departments (for example, the Ghanaian Ministry of Food and Agriculture) to help increase access to technology at the local level. The focus is on access to technology largely through local capacity-building rather than on technologies themselves.

Chapters are able to send overseas volunteers for four month work terms through the Junior Fellowship in International Development Program. Short term volunteers, or Junior Fellows, are student members returning to their chapter following their time overseas. Four months is considered a short term placement and the greatest impact is the overseas volunteers&#x27; contributions upon their return to their chapter in Canada – they return with a wide range of experiences and lessons that can be passed on to other members and the public at large.

Long-term overseas volunteers go on placements lasting one to three years. These are often university graduates that were involved with an EWB Canada university chapter. Knowledge and experience in international development, leadership skills and open-mindedness are considered much more important than just technical skills. The goal of these placements is not to alleviate poverty alone, but also to build capacity among the local non-governmental organization partners and community at large. For this reason all overseas projects are done in collaboration with a local NGO partner who is encouraged to take ownership of various projects and ultimately have no continued need for EWB Canada&#x27;s help and input.

==Partnerships==
As discussed above, EWB Canada works with local NGOs and government departments in order to carry out its overseas work. It also partners with other NGOs from time to time on projects of mutual interest, including the Canadian iteration of the Make Poverty History campaign.

===Relationships with other EWB organizations===
EWB Canada is legally and structurally separate from all other &quot;Engineers Without Borders&quot; organizations, although it assisted in the launch of EWB UK (which uses EWB Canada&#x27;s lightbulb logo), and has also maintained close relationships with EWB Australia, ISF Spain, ISF Italy, and Engineers for a Sustainable World in the U.S.

Like the other above-noted EWB/ISF groups, EWB Canada initially did not join the EWB International network, which was started by EWB-USA and includes a separate group in the province of Quebec, Ingénieurs sans frontières Québec. The Canadian organization said that while it did attend some of EWB-I&#x27;s meetings and occasionally collaborated with its member groups, active participation in that network would be difficult since the EWB-I groups did not share a &quot;common strategy and culture&quot; with each other, let alone with EWB Canada. In particular, the Canadian group was a strong critic of EWB-USA&#x27;s focus on short-term development projects run by each chapter, arguing that &quot;locally driven, locally appropriate change is the only sustainable change that will reduce people’s vulnerabilities and thus, reduce the need for short term, humanitarian type projects.&quot;

However, by early 2014, EWB Canada (along with several of the other previously-unaffiliated groups) had become a member of EWB International.

==Governance==
George Roter served as the chief executive officer of the organization from January 2011 to July 2014. Previously, Roter was co-CEO along with fellow co-founder Parker Mitchell. Boris Martin was CEO from August 2014 to June 2022.

<text>Thammasat University (TU; ; , ) is a public research university in Thailand with campuses in the Tha Phra Chan area of Bangkok, Rangsit, Pattaya and Lampang Province. , Thammasat University has over 39,000 students enrolled in 33 faculties, colleges, institutes and 2,000 academic staff.

Thammasat is Thailand&#x27;s second oldest university. Officially established to be the national university of Thailand on 27 June 1934, it was named by its founder, Pridi Banomyong, the University of Moral and Political Sciences (; ). It began as an open university, with 7,094 students studying law and politics in its first year.

In 1960, the university ended its free-entry policy and became the first in Thailand to require passing national entrance examinations for admission. Thammasat today offers more than 240 academic programmes in 33 different faculties and colleges on four campuses. Over the 80 years since its foundation, Thammasat University has evolved from an open university for law and politics to an international university offering all levels of academic degrees in many fields and disciplines. It has graduated more than 300,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The university&#x27;s alumni have included some of Thailand&#x27;s prime ministers, leading politicians, governmental figures, Bank of Thailand governors, and jurists.

Tha Phra Chan Campus, the original campus of the university, is in Phra Nakhon, Bangkok. The campus is in close proximity to many tourist destinations and was the site of the 14 October 1973 uprising and the 6 October 1976 massacre. Rangsit campus, where most undergraduate programmes are concentrated, is in Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani. Thammasat has smaller regional campuses in Lampang and Pattaya.

== History ==
The name &quot;Thammasat&quot; derives from the Buddhist-term Dhammasattha, meaning &quot;study of law&quot;.

=== University of Law and Political Sciences ===

Thammasat University began in 1934 as the University of Law and Political Sciences. This was two years after the so-called Siamese revolution of 1932 and eighteen years after the founding of Chulalongkorn University by transforming the law school of Prince Raphi Phatthanasak Krommaluang Ratcha Buri Direk Rit, which dated back to 1907. Thammasat University was the brainchild of Pridi Banomyong, the father of Thailand&#x27;s democracy and the minister of interior, who drafted the &quot;University of Law and Political Science Act 1934&quot;. The university was inaugurated on 27 June 1934, and Pridi served as the university&#x27;s first chancellor.

The university is based on the sixth principle of the People&#x27;s Party.
The first announcement of Khana Ratsadon stated the government &quot;must provide the people with full education&quot; because people &quot;lack education, which is reserved for royals&quot;. The desire of students at the school of law to be upgraded to a university rather than simply a department at Chulalongkorn University also helped Thammasat University become the successor of the law school. The property and faculty of the law school were transferred to University of Law and Political Science, and the old law school building was the first Thammasat site. The university moved to Tha Phra Chan campus the following year.

When the university opened, 7,094 people applied for admission. At that time, Chulalongkorn University was graduating only 68 students a year. Thammasat initially offered a bachelor&#x27;s degree with an emphasis on legal studies and previously banned economics and political science, plus a bachelor&#x27;s degree equivalent diploma in accountancy. Master&#x27;s degree courses soon followed in law, political science, and economics, and doctoral degree courses in law, political science, economics, and diplomacy.

During its early years, the university did not rely on government funding, but instead relied on its low tuition fees and interest paid by the Bank of Asia for Industry and Commerce, in which the university had an 80% stake.

Under Pridi&#x27;s leadership, the university became the clandestine headquarters of the Free Thai anti-Japanese underground during the Second World War. Ironically, the university campus also functioned as an internment camp for Allied civilians, with Thai guards more or less protecting them from abuses by the occupying Japanese. The internment camp was where the Multipurpose Building now stands.

=== Reform ===
The coup d&#x27;état on 8 November 1947 marked the end of an era. Pridi Banomyong left the country and went into exile. The original Thammasat degree was replaced by specialised departments in 1949, when the Faculties of Law, Political Science, Commerce and Accountancy, and Economics were founded. The university was forced to sell its bank shares, thus becoming dependent on government funding. The words &quot;and Political Sciences&quot; were removed from its name, and Thammasat was no longer an open university. A new &quot;Thammasat University Act&quot; was passed in 1952. Thammasat added four more faculties during the 1950s and 1960s: social administration, journalism and mass communication, liberal arts, and sociology and anthropology.

=== Bloody October protests ===
In 1973, Thammasat became the centre of the pro-democracy protest movement that led to the bloody uprising on 14 October. A large crowd, led by university students, assembled at Thammasat University to protest the arrest of thirteen pro-democracy student activists. The protest continued for several days before a bloody confrontation took place at the Democracy Monument. When Thailand&#x27;s military leaders fled into exile, Sanya Dharmasakti, then Thammasat rector, was appointed Prime Minister of Thailand.

Three years later, the 6 October 1976 massacre took place on the Tha Phra Chan campus. The event began with protests against the return of exiled dictator Thanom Kittikachorn. Violence first appeared on 25 September when two EGAT employees who handed out protest literature in Nakhon Pathom were branded &quot;communists&quot;, beaten to death, and their bodies hung from a wall. This led to peaceful protests by labor groups, students, and other activists demanding the expulsion of Thanom.

On 4 October, students staged a play on the Thammasat campus to dramatize the hanging of the protesters in Nakhon Pathom. Several newspapers printed photographs of the mock hanging with one of the students retouched to resemble Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, an act of lèse-majesté. Uniformed police and enraged right-wing paramilitary groups promptly surrounded Thammasat University. At dawn on 6 October the police and paramilitary groups attacked the protesters. The assault continued for several hours. Newspaper sources reported the number killed as between 43 and 46, but the actual figure may have been over a hundred, with several hundred more injured. Many student protesters escaped by jumping into Chao Phraya River, where they were shot at by the Royal Thai Navy.

One of the student leaders was Seksan Prasertkul, who wrote the protest song &quot;Su mai toi&quot;, which was adopted by the 2013-2014 anti-government protesters in Thailand. Seksan is now (2016) a lecturer at Thammasat University.

=== Expansion ===
During the 1980s, Thammasat University built a new campus at Rangsit to house the new Faculty of Science and Technology. It accepted its first students in 1985. The Faculty of Engineering opened at Rangsit in 1989, followed by the Faculty of Medicine in 1990. By the late-1990s, all first year students were studying at Rangsit. At present almost all undergraduate classes are taught at Rangsit, the exceptions being some international English language programmes and some special programmes. Graduate degree classes are still taught at Tha Phra Chan.

The Rangsit campus was chosen as one of the venues for the 1998 Asian Games.

Thammasat University is a member of &quot;Links to Asia by Organizing Traineeship and Student Exchange&quot; (LAOTSE), a network of universities in Europe and Asia. Regional cooperation is maintained by means of the Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network.

==Seal==
The seal depicts the centerpiece of the Democracy Monument, Bangkok, which itself honours the Thai Constitution of 1932. It is superimposed on a Dharmacakra, or &#x27;wheel of law&#x27;, symbolising the Dharmaśāstra, the university&#x27;s name in Sanskrit.

== Campuses ==
Thammasat University has two campuses in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, Tha Phra Chan and Rangsit. There are two regional campuses: Lampang and Pattaya.

=== Tha Phra Chan ===

Tha Phra Chan Centre () is in Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok, surrounded by many of Thailand&#x27;s most famous cultural and historical landmarks, such as Sanam Luang, the Grand Palace, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the Bangkok National Museum, the National Theatre, Wat Mahathat Yuwaratrangsarit, and the Chao Phraya River. It was the first permanent campus of Thammasat, purchased from the military with public donations in 1935. The site had originally been part of the Front Palace of the deputy king (formerly the designated heir to the throne).

The signature building of the university is the Dome, the original Tha Phra Chan campus building. It was constructed from four existing military buildings. The Dome housed Pridi Banomyong&#x27;s office as well as being the command centre of the Free Thai Movement during the Second World War. Late in the war, when an uprising against the occupying Japanese was planned, weapons were concealed in the attic.

The Tha Phra Chan campus played a role in the uprising against the military regime on 14 October 1973 and was the site of the 6 October 1976 Massacre.

Eight faculties are based at the Tha Phra Chan campus: law, political science, economics, commerce and accountancy, liberal arts, social administration, journalism and mass communication, and sociology and anthropology. , only postgraduate programmes, integrated bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programmes, and the English-language international programmes are offered at Tha Phra Chan (except those in engineering, health sciences, and journalism which are at the Rangsit Center). Thammasat Tha Phra Chan offers a Thai Language courses for foreigners. Tha Phra Chan facilities include a football field, a track, a gymnasium, eight libraries, and several cafeterias.

=== Rangsit ===
Rangsit Centre (Thai: ศูนย์รังสิต) is the second and largest Thammasat campus. It is in Khlong Luang District, Pathum Thani Province, 42 km north of Bangkok, connected Tha Phra Chan by shuttle bus. Thammasat University instituted degree programmes in engineering, technologies, physical sciences, and medicine at its Rangsit Centre in the 1980s and 1990s. Although established only for the science and technology-related faculties, all bachelor&#x27;s degrees have been taught here since 2006. All faculties (except the College of Innovation, the College of Interdisciplinary Studies, and the Pridi Banomyong International College) are at Rangsit. The campus houses the Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, an international academic institute attached to Thammasat which emphasizes engineering and technological research and education. International programmes in engineering, health sciences, and journalism are also taught at Rangsit Centre. The Thailand Science Park (National Research Centre) and the Asian Institute of Technology are also located here.

The campus divided into three areas: the academic zone, the housing zone, and various sport facilities. The Thammasat University Sport Centre, on the Rangsit campus, was used in the 1998 Asian Games, 1999 FESPIC Games and in the 2007 Summer Universiade.

In December 2019, the Rangsit campus opened Asia&#x27;s largest urban rooftop garden. The 7,000 m2 space, designed by Kotchakorn Voraakhom, is designed to help offset some of the impacts of climate change, such as flooding. &quot;Urban rooftop farms are an easy and effective climate solution, and should be the norm.&quot;, she said. The rooftop farm is open to anyone who wishes to grow rice, vegetables, or herbs according to the university.

=== Branch campuses ===
Pattaya Centre (Thai: ศูนย์พัทยา), is in Pattaya, Bang Lamung District, Chonburi Province. This 566 rai site was donated to the Ministry of Finance for Thammasat University in 1987. Construction began in 1997. The Pattaya Centre houses the College of Innovative Education, which offers advanced degree courses and training in rural development and management.

Lampang Centre (Thai: ศูนย์ลำปาง), Hang Chat District, Lampang Province: the Thammasat University Council approved the establishment of Lampang Centre in 1996. The university initially held classes in the old city hall. In 2003, the Lampang Centre moved to its current location 15 km from the city. Thammasat Lampang offers opportunities to a small student population of fewer than 1,000 students to study specialized courses on local development and industry. Courses offered at Thammasat Lampang Center include social development, interdisciplinary sociology, law, and handcraft design.
==Faculties, colleges, institutes==
Thammasat University has 19 faculties, seven colleges, and seven institutes.

===Faculty of Law===
The Faculty of Law was one of the founding faculties of the university. It has its roots in the law school of the Ministry of Justice, instituted under the reign of King Chulalongkorn by Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns. Former deans of the faculty have included Phraya Nitisat Phaisan, Sanya Dharmasakti, and Preedee Kasemsup. The faculty has programmes up to the doctorate level, as well as several certificate programmes in business law and public law.

===Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy===

The faculty also offers Thailand&#x27;s first international programme in business in which English is the language of instruction (BBA Programme). The faculty also offers Thailand&#x27;s first Global Executive MBA programme in which English is the language of instruction (GEMBA programme).

The faculty is recognised internationally. In 2005, a team of students from the Master&#x27;s of Sciences Degree Programme in Marketing (MIM) of Thammasat Business School won, for the second time, the Global Moot Corp, a venue for business plan competition, held at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin.

The faculty is the second accounting and business education institution in South East Asia to Singapore which has received the Triple-Crown certification from three world accredited institutions (EQUIS, AACSB, and AMBA). With less than 1% of commercial and business administration accounting institutions from educational institutions around the world that have been certified for all 3 accredited institutions.
The faculty is also known as Thammasat Business School (TBS).

===Faculty of Political Science===
The Faculty of Political Science at Thammasat University was established in 1949. Former deans include Direk Chaiyanam a member of the Khana Ratsadon (People&#x27;s Party) and a former foreign minister. It offers undergraduate and graduate studies in three majors, politics and government, public administration, and international affairs. Most Thai governors, mayors, leaders, and activists graduated from this faculty.

Graduate programmes are offered to regular students, and special programmes are open to executives. A doctoral programme was established in 2001. There are two versions of the masters and bachelors programmes in international relations. The first versions are taught in Thai. The second versions are taught in English and are called the &quot;International Programme&quot;. The masters for the International Programme was established in 1998; the bachelors was established in 2009. The military correspondent for the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;, Wassana Nanuam, is a prominent graduate of the masters programme, having written her thesis on the Thai military.

This faculty is also known as &quot;Singha Daeng&quot; (&#x27;red lion&#x27;) along with Chulalongkorn University which is called &quot;Singha Dam&quot; (&#x27;black lion&#x27;).

===Faculty of Economics===
The Faculty of Economics at Thammasat University was established in 1949 and the oldest Faculty of Economics in Thailand. The faculty offers a broad range of academic programmes and other training opportunities. Under the leadership of Dr. Puey Ungpakorn, a former Bank of Thailand governor who took charge concurrently as the dean of the faculty, there were many significant developments within the economics faculty. Dr. Puey secured funding from Rockefeller Foundation and brought faculty members from a number of US universities.

The first big step toward internationalization was the introduction, in 1969, a Master of Economics programme degree taught in English. Since then, a bachelor&#x27;s programme and a PhD programme taught in English have been added to the curriculum.

The faculty boasts a teaching staff which totals 82, including 44 faculty members with doctoral degree and seven on leave to pursue doctoral degrees. It is considered one of the strongest programmes in Thailand. Its graduates are regularly accepted to the prestigious departments of economics such as Chicago, UC Berkeley, Cornell, Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, Harvard, MIT, Yale, Princeton, PSE.

=== Faculty of Social Administration ===
The Faculty of Social Administration Thammasat University was established to serve state policies, welfare and social security.

The institute enjoys strong links with Thailand National Science and Technology Development Agency, Thailand Science Park, national graduate schools (such as JGSEE, TGIST, and TAIST) and many international universities, notably its neighbour Asian Institute of Technology, and a group of Japanese and European universities.

Being a research-led academic institution in nature, from the most recent performance evaluation (academic year 2003) by the university, the institute has the highest number of research publications (both in raw quantity and per graduate student heads), compared to other academic units in the university, and when compared to other universities, each SIIT faculty member produces twice the highest value of national range for international journal publications (0.74 vs 0-0.41, academic year 2004). In 2007, the Thailand Research Fund assessed research outcomes of universities in Thailand, and SIIT ranked as &quot;very good&quot; on all three indicators.
The institute is also one of a very small number of universities which can secure numbers of Thailand Research Fund&#x27;s &quot;Royal Golden Jubilee grants&quot;, considered to be the country&#x27;s most prestigious research grants for PhD students, for every single year since the programme began in 1998 — one of the only three which can secure &quot;Engineering discipline&quot; grants for every single year.

Anyway, it&#x27;s still considered one of the easiest engineering schools to get accepted due to very low entry score and many rounds of admission. Due to admission score, SIIT has a high rate of variant admission scores, students with high admission score and lowest admission score can be entered but most of the low-performance students will be disqualified.

<text>James Jude Orbinski is a Canadian physician, humanitarian activist, author, and scholar in global health. Dr. Orbinski began his role as principal of Massey College at the University of Toronto in the 2024-2025 academic year, where he is also Full Professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine in the Temerty Faculty of Medicine, and is cross-appointed to the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, as well as the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, (Division of Clinical Public Health). Previously a professor in the Faculty of Health Science at York University, Dr. Orbinski founded the Dahdaleh Institute of Global Health Research. 

Orbiniski has held the CIGI Chair in Global Health Governance at the Balsillie School of International Affairs and Wilfrid Laurier University (2012-2017), and prior to that, he was Chair of Global Health at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health (2010-2012) and full professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto (2003-2012). 

Orbinski&#x27;s research focuses on medical humanitarianism, intervention strategies around emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, global health governance, and more recently, the health impacts of climate change.

After extensive fieldwork with Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), in 1998 Orbinski was elected President of the International Council. He was MSF International Council president at the time the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. Orbinski is also co-founder and chair of the Board of Directors of Dignitas International, a medical humanitarian organization researching and working with communities in the global south to increase access to life-saving treatment and prevention in areas overwhelmed by HIV/AIDS, and with Aboriginal communities in Canada to improve community-based care for diseases such as diabetes. He is a strong advocate for increasing access to essential medicines for neglected diseases, particularly across vulnerable populations.

In 1998, Orbinski received the Governor General&#x27;s Meritorious Service Cross for his work as the MSF Head of Mission during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In 2009, Orbinski became an Officer of the Order of Canada and in the citation was recognized by the Governor General of Canada as a humanitarian practitioner and advocate for those who have been silenced by war, genocide and mass starvation.

==Education and medical career==

Orbinski attended Dawson CEGEP in Montreal, received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Trent University (1984), a medical degree from McMaster University Medical School (1990), and a master&#x27;s degree in international relations from the University of Toronto&#x27;s Munk Centre for International Studies (1998).

Following medical school, Orbinski held a Medical Research Council of Canada fellowship to study pediatric HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 1991, he began working internationally with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). After his first mission in Peru, Orbinski served as MSF&#x27;s Medical Coordinator in Baidoa during the Somali Civil War and famine of 1992–93, and in Jalalabad, Afghanistan during the winter of 1994. He was subsequently MSF&#x27;s Head of Mission in Kigali during the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and in Goma, Zaire during the refugee crisis in 1996–97.

Orbinski was elected President of the International Council of MSF from 1998 to 2001. As international president of MSF, he represented the organization in numerous humanitarian emergencies and on critical humanitarian issues including in the Sudan, Kosovo, Russia, Cambodia, South Africa, India and Thailand, among others. Orbinski also represented MSF at the UN Security Council, in many national parliaments, to the World Health Organization, as well as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He accepted the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to MSF for its pioneering approach to medical humanitarianism, and most especially for its approach to bearing witness. As MSF International Council president, he allocated the Nobel Prize money to launch MSF&#x27;s Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines that year.

On September 11, 2001, Orbinski was in Lower Manhattan to present at a UN meeting on Neglected Tropical Diseases. He witnessed the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and participated in relief efforts for injured people ferried across the Hudson River.

From 2001 to 2004, Orbinski co-chaired MSF&#x27;s Neglected Diseases Working Group, which created and launched the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi). The DNDi is a global not-for-profit research consortium focused on developing treatments for tropical diseases of the developing world that are largely neglected by profit-driven research and development companies. Since its inception, the DNDi has engaged in international advocacy for neglected tropical diseases, and developed and disseminated two antimalarial treatments, one new treatment against sleeping sickness, one new treatment against Visceral leishmaniasis, a set of treatments for Visceral leishmaniasis in Asia, and a pediatric dosage formulation for Chagas Disease. These new drugs are now available to millions of people. DNDi also has a development portfolio of over 30 lead compounds targeting neglected diseases.

== Academic Career ==
In 2004, Orbinski became a research scientist at St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital and professor of both medicine and political science at the University of Toronto. The medical journal The Lancet recognized one of his co-authored papers on HIV/AIDS treatment adherence as among the 20 most significant medical research papers of that year (2006). Another co-authored paper in The Lancet published in 2002 examined the research gap around neglected diseases. It was noted as being &quot;one of the most important scholarly articles that shaped scholarship in the field of global health in the post Second World War years.&quot;

Orbinski was promoted to full Professor of Medicine in 2010 at the University of Toronto. From 2012 to 2017, he held the CIGI Research Chair in Global Health at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, and was Professor of International Policy and Governance at Wilfrid Laurier University. Orbinski was the 2016-2017 Fulbright visiting professor in Health at the University of California, Irvine. 

In September 2017, he joined the faculty of York University, Toronto as professor and founding director of the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research at York University, Toronto, Canada.

In August 2024, Orbinski was appointed as Principal of Massey College at the University of Toronto. He was reinstated as full Professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine in the Temerty Faculty of Medicine, and is cross-appointed to the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, as well as the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, (Division of Clinical Public Health). 

==Book and film==
Orbinski&#x27;s best-selling 2008 book, &#x27;An Imperfect Offering: Humanitarian Action for the 21st Century&#x27;, recounts his experiences as a physician working for MSF throughout the 1990s, including a &quot;harrowing personal account&quot; as MSF Chief of Mission in Rwanda during the genocide. It also explores the political context for medical humanitarianism and some of the challenges for humanitarianism in the 21st century. &#x27;An Imperfect Offering&#x27; has been translated into five languages and has won the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada&#x27;s 2009 Shaughnessy Cohen Award for best political writing in Canada. It was also one of five books nominated for the 2008 Canadian Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award in non-fiction and was selected as one of National Public Radio 2008 Top Five Political &amp; Current Affairs Books. 

Orbinski is the subject of the 2005 CBC documentary &#x27;Evil Revisited&#x27;, which documented his visit to Rwanda on the tenth anniversary of the genocide, his first such visit since the violence.&#x27;

He was also the subject of the award-winning and internationally acclaimed documentary film on medial humanitarianism, , which follows Orbinski&#x27;s return to Somalia, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. &quot;Triage&quot; was screened at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, and won the Amnesty International Gold Medal Award. It was released in theatres across Canada in the fall of 2008 and was televised in Canada and the US in 2009. In 2011, &#x27;Triage&#x27; was incorporated into the &quot;War and Medicine&quot; at the Canadian War Museum.

==Humanitarian Activism==
Orbinski was a co-founder of McMaster University&#x27;s Health Reach Program which investigates and promotes the health of children in war zones, and he was a founding member of MSF Canada in 1990. In 2004, he co-founded Dignitas International, a hybrid medical/research non-government organization focusing on transforming global health for the most vulnerable. Dignitas remains at the forefront of addressing chronic and extreme humanitarian vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. It is also committed to continuing to improve health systems and the quality of patient care, and to the transformational power of research. Through a 12-year partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health, more than 1.4 million people have been tested for HIV infection, and more than 270,000 people have been started on treatment for AIDS in three hospitals and 165 remote village-based clinics in the southern region of Malawi. Dignitas trains more than 500 Malawian health care workers a year and maintains an extensive and ongoing research platform. It has published more than fifty major research papers, many of which have transformed patient care, health systems, and health policy. As of 2014 and in partnership with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, and the Sioux Lookout First Nations Health Authority, Dignitas has also established an Aboriginal Health Partners Program focused on the health needs of First Nations Communities in Northern Ontario, Canada. Since 2017, Dignitas has committed to exploring, defining and participating in a research collaboration on the health impacts of climate change.

Orbinski is also a founding board member of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, the Stephen Lewis Foundation and Canadian Doctors for Medicare. A founding board member of the editorial boards of Open Medicine and Conflict and Health, he also sits on the editorial board of Ars Medica. Orbinski additionally serves on the advisory boards of Global Policy, Engineers Without Borders (Canada), The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Incentives for Global Health, the NGO formed to develop the Health Impact Fund proposal. He is a member of the Climate Change and Health Council and the Davos World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Agenda Council on Health Care Systems and Cooperation. He was an invited member of the UNEP Scientific Steering Committee on Disaster Preparedness and Early Warning for Extreme Weather and in 2011 the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences Expert Panel on Canada&#x27;s Strategic Role in Global Health. As of 2011, he is an honorary director of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) and sits on several global health-related advisory boards.

<text>The hostile media effect, originally deemed the hostile media phenomenon and sometimes called hostile media perception, refers to the tendency for individuals with a strong preexisting opinion on an issue to perceive media coverage as biased against their position&#x27;s side and favorable of their antagonists&#x27; point of view. Partisans from opposite sides of an issue will tend to find the same coverage to be biased against them. The phenomenon was first proposed and experimentally studied in the 1980s by Robert Vallone, Lee Ross and Mark Lepper.

==Studies==
In 1982, the second major study of this phenomenon was undertaken when pro-Palestinian students and pro-Israeli students at Stanford University were shown the same news filmstrips of the then-recent Sabra and Shatila massacre. 

First, each partisan group evaluated the fairness of the media&#x27;s sample of facts and arguments differently: in light of their own divergent views about the objective merits of each side&#x27;s case and their corresponding views about the nature of unbiased coverage. Second, each group reported more negative references to their side than positive ones, and each predicted that the coverage would sway nonpartisans in a hostile direction. Within both partisan groups, furthermore, greater knowledge of the crisis was associated with stronger perceptions of media bias. Both sides said a neutral observer would have a more negative view of their side from viewing the clips, and that the media would have excused the other side where it blamed their side.

Subsequent studies have found hostile media effects related to other political conflicts, such as strife in Bosnia, immigration in the U.S. and in U.S. presidential elections, as well as in other areas, such as media coverage of the South Korean National Security Act, the 1997 United Parcel Service Teamsters strike, genetically modified food, and sports.

The effect was originally dubbed &quot;hostile media phenomenon&quot; by Vallone et al., and is occasionally referred to as &quot;hostile media perception,&quot; since it seems to precipitate the effects of media. In a 2015 meta-analysis of the subject, Perloff said &quot;hostile media effect&quot; is the most often used term:The most common term is &quot;hostile media effect,&quot; perhaps because scholars appreciate that the &quot;effect&quot; term cuts to the heart of the mass communication research enterprise and captures the theoretically intriguing aspect of the hostile media phenomenon. (703) The effect appears to be something of a disconfirmation bias, or &quot;a contrast bias – a deviation of judgment in which a partisan individual perceives or evaluates media content to be further away, in terms of valence, from his or her own point of view.&quot; In other words, the intention of the reporter or the story is irrelevant – those &quot;partisans&quot; who consume the content find the content that is hostile to their point of view on their own.

An oft-cited forerunner to Vallone et al.&#x27;s study was conducted by Albert Hastorf and Hadley Cantril in 1954. Princeton and Dartmouth students were shown a filmstrip of a controversial Princeton-Dartmouth football game. Asked to count the number of infractions committed by both sides, students at both universities &quot;saw&quot; many more infractions committed by the opposing side, in addition to making different generalizations about the game. Hastorf and Cantril concluded that &quot;there is no such &#x27;thing&#x27; as a &#x27;game&#x27; existing &#x27;out there&#x27; in its own right which people merely &#x27;observe.&#x27; ... For the &#x27;thing&#x27; simply is &quot;not&quot; the same for different people whether the &#x27;thing&#x27; is a football game, a presidential candidate, Communism, or spinach.&quot;

==Explanations==

=== Cognitive ===
Three cognitive mechanisms for explaining the hostile media effect have been suggested:
* Selective recall refers to memory and retrieval. In instances of the hostile media effect, partisans should tend to remember more of the disconfirming portions of a message than the parts that support their position, in a variation of the negativity effect. Vallone and his colleagues observed selective recall differing along partisan lines even on simple, objective criteria such as the number of references to a given subject. However, numerous studies have documented the hostile media effect even when selective recall is positive rather than negative.
* Selective perception refers to the process by which individuals perceive what they want to in media messages while ignoring opposing viewpoints. In instances of the hostile media effect, partisans have a heightened tendency to interpret aspects of a message as unfavorable – or hostile – as opposed to categorizations by non-partisans. In other words, selective perception is a form of bias because we interpret information in a way that is congruent with our existing values and beliefs.
* The different standards explanation or motivated reasoning refers to the validity of arguments. This is confirmation bias taken to the next level. It leads people to confirm what they already believe, while ignoring contrary data. But it also drives people to develop elaborate rationalizations to justify holding beliefs that logic and evidence have shown to be wrong. Motivated reasoning responds defensively to contrary evidence, actively discrediting such evidence or its source without logical or evidentiary justification. It seems to be assumed by social scientists that motivated reasoning is driven by a desire to avoid cognitive dissonance. It suggests that reason partisans are so prone to see an unbiased message in a hostile light is because of the strength of the favorable argument they have built in their minds over time. Rather than seeing confirmation bias as an opposite force of hostile media effect, the different standards explanation sees it as a contributing force. As Vallone et al. noted in the seminal study:
Partisans who have consistently processed facts and arguments in light of their preconceptions and prejudices [...] are bound to believe that the preponderance of reliable, pertinent evidence favors their viewpoint. Accordingly, to the extent that the small sample of evidence and argument featured in a media presentation seems unrepresentative of this larger &quot;population&quot; of information, perceivers will charge bias in the presentation and will be likely to infer hostility and bias on the part of those responsible for it.

It is important to note that these criteria allow for specific measures beyond subjective generalizations about the media coverage as a whole, such as what might be expressed as &quot;I thought that the news has been generally biased against this side of the issue.&quot; The research suggests the hostile media effect is not just a difference of &quot;opinion&quot; but a difference of &quot;perception&quot; (selective perception).

=== Source factors ===
Characteristics of the message source may also influence the hostile media effect. A source perceived to be friendly to the partisan (usually because of agreeable ideology or geographic proximity to the group) is less likely to invoke the hostile media effect than a source that is disagreeable or geographically detached. In numerous studies, Albert C. Gunther and his associates have suggested that the ability of mass media to reach a large audience is what triggers the hostile media effect. Consistently, they found that a message appearing to originate from a newspaper was perceived as hostile by partisans, while an identical message appearing in a student essay was perceived as unbiased, or even favorable toward the partisan cause.

The phenomenon also exists for personalities on television – partisans in a study were found to perceive significantly less bias in a host they perceive as like-minded. Consistent with a hostile media effect, issue partisans perceived less bias in opinionated news hosts whose viewpoints cohered with their own than did non-partisans and especially partisans on the opposing side of the issue. In most cases, these partisan differences were as big as—if not bigger than—the differences seen in response to non-opinionated news, indicating that even blatant deviations from journalistic norms do not quell partisan selectivity in news perceptions, at least when it comes to perceived bias in the host of opinionated programs. While partisans can agree on the bias of a particular source, the reasons for that bias appears to account for the difference; that is, consumers on both sides of an issue may see bias in a particular story, but are more likely to attribute that story to a host they perceive as hostile to their own particular cause.

=== Partisanship ===
All of these explanatory mechanisms are influenced by partisanship. From the first studies, the hostile media effect has required an audience of partisans, with stronger beliefs correlating with stronger manifestations of the effect. Increasing devotion to a particular side of an issue leads to increasing levels of biased information processing, whether out of protection of personal values or a strong sense of group affiliation.

==Relative hostile media effect==
Early hostile media effect studies measured perceptions of a media message designed to be unbiased. As ideologically diversified news outlets became more commonplace, later experiments began to use messages that were less objective. They found that while partisans on both sides of an issue recognized the bias, the group the message opposed perceived a greater degree of bias than the group the message supported. This variation is referred to as the relative hostile media effect, and has been demonstrated in media coverage of the use of primates for lab testing. Gunther et al. said, &quot;the relative hostile media effect occurs when individuals with different attitudes toward the issue exhibit significantly different evaluations of the same media content.”

In fact, as Glass et al. noted in a 2000 study, &quot;partisans tend to see objectively biased articles as &#x27;even-handed&#x27; if the bias impugns the opposition group.&quot; The study measured the responses of voters who support and oppose abortion rights, finding that &quot;people with more extreme views on abortion sometimes evaluate biased news articles as being fair, but only when the opposing side is being gored.&quot;

The effect appears to exist more among conservatives than liberals, according to multiple studies. When randomly assigned either a clip from Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot; (liberal), or a similar program from Fox News (conservative), conservatives perceived significantly more bias in the program than liberal subjects. It is entirely possible that the &quot;relative hostile media effect,&quot; in this case, is a function of preconceived biases related to the program itself, rather than the content. In a 1998 study, Dalton et al., found that newspaper readers were best able to detect the partisan stands of their newspapers when the newspaper sent a clear and unambiguous political signal; otherwise, individual partisanship predominated in judgments. Unsurprisingly, studies related to media content that is strictly opinionated – that is, media content that is not intended to be unbiased – have shown that partisans are quite capable of identifying bias in those conditions.

== Media literacy ==
Studies to determine whether media literacy – competency in analyzing and evaluating messages from mass media – might affect a media consumer&#x27;s hostile media effect have limited results. In a 2014 study, participants watched a Media Literacy PSA prior to watching manipulated television programs, then asked to rate their perceptions of the relative hostility of the media afterwards. The effects were strong in some areas but less so in others. &quot;Given that the digital media environment allows individuals to select their own media content – and people tend to choose what they find more credible – in some cases a news media literacy message may spur further selection into agreeable political enclaves, now seen as even more credible, and contribute to rising political polarization&quot; (26). Besides media literacy messages, empathy was introduced to news messages to see whether the emotion can reduce HME. People were found to perceive higher levels of media favorability toward their personal position, but not a reduction in media hostility toward the opposing side.

== Moderators ==

=== Reach ===
Gunther and Schmitt attempted to discern why in some cases research subjects faulted ambiguous, contradictory information, and supported it in other cases. One conclusion they suggested was the reach of the publication – that is, the hostile media effect is likely to emerge when participants are estimating the effects on others of mass media with a large reach, but biased assimilation would occur when the participants are judging media with lower reach (in this case, a research report that presumably reaches only people in a particular field).

=== Involvement ===
Hansen and Kim found that involvement is positively correlated with hostile media effect; that is, the effect increases as individuals become more involved with the issue. The study also found a significant effect that emerged with those who have low involvement. Other studies have found high correlations of the effect in &quot;value-relevant involvement&quot; and in &quot;affective involvement&quot;.

=== Social identity ===
Social identity theory suggests that media coverage of an ego-involving issue will activate group identity and increase the salience of the issue among members of a group that champions a particular political or social cause. This in turn triggers self-categorization processes, as ingroup members differentiate themselves from their counterparts in the outgroup, seeking to elevate their self-esteem by viewing the ingroup as superior to the disliked outgroup on core dimensions. When exposed to controversial media coverage that contains unfavorable depictions of the ingroup, group members, concerned about the perceived inaccuracy of the portrayals and convinced that the portrayals undermine the group&#x27;s legitimacy in the larger society, cope by derogating media coverage, viewing it as hostilely biased. In this way, they reduce the symbolic threat and restore valued social self-esteem.

A related potential moderator is the outgroup membership of the message source. Reid found that more politically extreme Democratic students perceived less bias when a polemical assault on their group was attributed to a Democratic (ingroup) organization, but detected more bias when the attack was ascribed to a pro-Republican outgroup.

== Mediators ==
Perloff identified four factors as the reasons those individuals with strong attitudes towards a particular issue, as well as high involvement, might perceive hostile media bias: &quot;selective recall&quot;, which causes partisans to focus more on contradictory information; &quot;selective categorization&quot;, in which partisans categorize more content as unfair to their position than fair; &quot;different standards&quot;, in which partisans classify more of the content that reflects positively on their position as accurate, and information that reflects negatively as inaccurate; and &quot;prior beliefs about media bias&quot;, in which partisans judge media content unfairly based on a generalized negative set of beliefs about the media in general.

== Hostile media online ==

Research around HME in the digital age is still in relative infancy. Partisan users of online media have abilities to interact with the mass media in a way they have never before. Some may attribute the effects of hostile media in the future to issue-specific social media messages, for example. Relative effects may be higher, however, in the digital media future:Partisans on both sides could easily agree that a series of posts is biased in one ideological direction, but those whose political ox is being gored should be more likely to presume bias and hostile intent. More generally, anecdotal evidence suggests that individuals perceive that social media messages have strong effects, frequently perceiving that negative communications will have deleterious influences on online third persons. (722) Indeed, news audiences were found to perceive malicious intent based on their personal political stance, contributing to hostile perceptions with Facebook news messages.

== Consequences ==

=== Persuasive press inference ===
Gunther and Chia invoked the concept of persuasive press inference in a 2001 study, in which individuals form impressions of the direction or slant of news coverage, extrapolate that news in general resembles the news stories they personally viewed, assume that high-reach news influences the public, and therefore presume that public opinion corresponds with the perceived directionality of news. Therefore, those partisans who begin with the belief in a hostile media will conclude that public opinion is opposed to their particular cause. Research for this hypothesis has produced mixed results.

It is not clear if the hostile media effect translates into real-world effects. Some research has explored the ways in which individuals take action to &quot;&#x27;correct&#x27; perceived &#x27;wrongs&#x27;&quot; created by a perceived hostile media depiction of the individuals&#x27; group. This research has suggested that these individuals effectively feel disenfranchised, and may react by &quot;defying the dominant public opinion climate, even engaging in undemocratic actions, and other times adopting a more passive approach, withdrawing from functional political or social activities.&quot;

=== Motivated fake news perception ===
Tsang has revealed that the hostile media perception can be applied to a fake news context. Partisans from opposing sides were found to perceive the exact same news message to be fake to significantly varying degrees.

<text>Shahmukhi (, , , ) is the right-to-left abjad-based script developed from the Perso-Arabic alphabet used for the Punjabi language varieties, predominantly in Punjab, Pakistan. It is generally written in the Nastaʿlīq calligraphic hand, which is also used for Persian and Urdu. Shahmukhi is one of the two standard scripts used for Punjabi, the other being Gurmukhi used mainly in Punjab, India. Shahmukhi is written from right to left and has 36 primary letters with some other additional letters.

== History ==
Before the advent of Shahmukhi, writing systems were not popular for the Old Punjabi varieties.

The name &#x27;Shahmukhi&#x27; is a recent coinage, imitating its counterpart &#x27;Gurmukhi&#x27;. However, the writing of Punjabi in the Perso-Arabic script is well-attested from the 17th century onwards. According to Dhavan, Punjabi began to adopt the script as a &quot;side effect&quot; of educational practices in Mughal-era Punjab, when Punjabi Muslims learned the Persian language in order to participate in Mughal society. Educational materials taught Persian to Punjabi speakers by using Punjabi written in Persian&#x27;s alphabet, which was a novel innovation. This was one of the first attempts at standardising the Punjabi language; prior to this, Punjabi was primarily a spoken language, not formally taught in schools.

Shackle suggests that the Gurmukhi script was not favoured by Punjabi Muslims due to its religious (Sikh) connotations.

==Alphabet==
Shahmukhi script is a modified version of the Arabic script&#x27;s Persian alphabet. It is identical to the Urdu alphabet, but contains additional letters representing the Punjabi phonology. For writing Saraiki, an extended Shahmukhi is used that includes 4 additional letters for the implosive consonants ().

=== Vowel diacritics ===
Like Urdu, Shahmukhi also has diacritics, which are implied - a convention retained from the original Arabic script, to express short vowels.
=== Consonants ===

No Punjabi words begin with , , or . Words which begin with are exceedingly rare, but some have been documented in Shahmukhi dictionaries such as Iqbal Salahuddin&#x27;s &quot;Waddi Punjabi Lughat&quot;.
The digraphs of aspirated consonants are as follows. In addition, and form ligatures with : () and ().

==== Aspirates ====
* (waddi ye) is only found in the final position, when writing the sounds e (ਏ) or æ (ਐ), and in initial and medial positions, it takes the form of .
* Vowels are expressed as follows:

=== Difference from Persian and Urdu ===

Shahmukhi has more letters than its Persian base and related Urdu alphabet, to represent the special sounds that are only in Punjabi, which already have additional letters added to the Arabic base itself to represent sounds not present in Arabic. Characters added which differ from Persian but not Urdu include: to represent /ʈ/, to represent /ɖ/, to represent /ɽ/, to represent /◌̃/, and to represent /ɛ:/ or /e:/. Furthermore, a separate do-cashmi-he letter, , exists to denote a /ʰ/ or a /ʱ/, this letter is mainly used as part of the multitude of digraphs, detailed above. Characters added which differ from Urdu include: لؕ to represent /ɭ/ and ݨ to represent /ɳ/. These characters, however are seldom used.

=== Pronunciation ===
The letter is pronounced &#x27;j&#x27; in French or as vion in English and the letter is often transliterated in many ways due to its changing sound in various Arabic and Persian words.

<text>USS &quot;Spruance&quot; (DD-963) was the lead ship of the United States Navy&#x27;s of destroyers and was named after Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. &quot;Spruance&quot; was built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and launched by Mrs. Raymond A. Spruance. &quot;Spruance&quot; served in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, assigned to Destroyer Squadron 24 and operating out of Naval Station Mayport, Florida. &quot;Spruance&quot; was decommissioned on 23 March 2005 and then was sunk as a target on 8 December 2006.

==History==
===1960s===
Bath Iron Works, General Dynamics and Litton Industries submitted proposals for production of DD-963 on 3 April 1969. Of the $30 million assigned, $28.5 million has been provided to three contractors. Eventually, Litton&#x27;s bid won the competition.

===1970s===
&quot;Spruance&quot; was the first of a highly-successful class of anti-submarine warfare and anti-ship destroyers, and was the first destroyer powered by gas turbines in the U.S. Navy. At first she was armed with two 5-inch naval guns, an ASROC missile launcher, and an eight-cell NATO Sea Sparrow missile launcher. &quot;Spruance&quot; received one Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) during the late 1980s. This replaced the original Mark 16 ASROC launcher. Also added to &quot;Spruance&quot; after several years of service was an eight-cell launcher for Harpoon anti-ship missiles.

&quot;Spruance&quot;″s first operational deployment was in October 1979 to the Mediterranean Sea, as a member of the Carrier Battle Group. The other warships in this task force included , , , and . During this deployment, &quot;Spruance&quot; made a transit into the Black Sea to conduct surveillance on the new Soviet helicopter carrier, , as she steamed from her building shipyard to the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet. &quot;Spruance&quot; suffered a malfunction in one of her LM2500 Gas Turbine Main Engines and had to replace the engine while deployed. This was done successfully in port.

&quot;Spruance&quot;, being the first gas-turbine powered ship in the U.S. fleet, had an underway replenishment breakaway flag (flown while pulling away from receiving supplies and fuel from a logistics ship at sea) that was a replication of the large yellow warning seen on the side of aircraft carriers, with red block letters saying &quot;BEWARE JET BLAST&quot; on a large yellow background. Upon &quot;breaking&quot; (unfurling) the flag on the halyards, they would play the theme song from the 1976 film &quot;Rocky&quot; as they increased speed and sailed ahead of the logistics vessel.

===1980s===
&quot;Spruance&quot; entered her first major overhaul in 1980 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. During a brief shipyard period in 1983, she received the Phalanx CIWS and the TAS Mk 23 radar system.

&quot;Spruance&quot; steamed to the Arabian Sea in 1983 including a port visit to Mombasa, Kenya, in May 1983. She briefly took station off Beirut in June 1982 before being relieved. In 1982, she transited both the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal during the same summer.

&quot;Spruance&quot; deployed for a six-month period in January 1983 to the Persian Gulf where she spent four and one-half months conducting observations in company with during the Iraq-Iran War. She also conducted operations with Teamwork &#x27;84 in the northern Atlantic and in the Arctic Ocean in 1984. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in November 1984 and conducted her second Black Sea Operations over Thanksgiving 1984. She returned from her deployment in May 1985 and shortly thereafter entered her second overhaul period during which she received VLS, Towed Array, and the SH 60. She deployed for a six-month period on 26 May 1993 to the Red Sea where she spent over three and a half months conducting visit and board and search operations in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. While attached to the U.S. Sixth Fleet, &quot;Spruance&quot; conducted a brief stop for fuel in Rota, Spain, followed by a liberty port visit in Palma, Spain. Additional stops in the Mediterranean consisted of a brief stop in Augusta Bay, Sicily, then to Souda Bay, Crete, for a maintenance period (IMAV) with . &quot;Spruance&quot; passed through the Suez Canal on 29 June.

Admirals Vern Clark and Gary Roughead (who would later go on to become the 27th and 29th Chiefs of Naval Operations, respectively), were &quot;Spruance&quot;″s commanding officer and executive officer, respectively, from 1984 to 1985.

On 26 January 1989, &quot;Spruance&quot; ran aground on a reef while traveling at near Andros Island in the Bahamas. The incident occurred during anti-submarine training exercises in the deep-water trench east of the island. Navy tugs and the USS &quot;Boone&quot; re-floated the ship, which suffered $1.8 million in damage to the hull, propellers, sonar dome, and forward mast. A Navy report faulted a junior officer who had conduct at the time of the incident, Lt. W.T. Hicks, finding that he ignored the advice of the quartermaster who advised against a course change that would take them closer to the reef. Hicks was discharged from the Navy following the grounding. Neither the ship&#x27;s skipper, Commander Travis W. Parker Jr., or the Executive Officer, Commander J.M. Braeckel, were on the bridge at the time of the maneuvers that led to the grounding.

===1990s===
Upon arrival in the Red Sea, under command of CTG 152.1, Commander Maritime Interdiction Forces, &quot;Spruance&quot; assumed the duties of the flagship for the task force commander. While on station, &quot;Spruance&quot; was the flagship for three different task force commanders. While on station, &quot;Spruance&quot; conducted exercises with the Egyptian Navy and the Jordanian Navy. During &quot;Spruance&quot;″s tenure in the Red Sea, she conducted several port visits to Hurghada, Egypt, for crew rest and relaxation. Other official port visits were conducted in Safaga, Egypt, and Aqaba, Jordan, where &quot;Spruance&quot; hosted receptions for top military and embassy officials. On 10 September 1993, &quot;Spruance&quot; intercepted the 18,000th ship since sanctions were put into place in August 1990, as part of the multinational maritime interception effort enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq. The ship&#x27;s crew intercepted the Maltese-flagged bulk carrier &quot;Early Star&quot; in the North Red Sea during normal intercept operations. The merchant ship was sailing from Massaua, Eritrea, to Aqaba. As the ship was empty, it was allowed to proceed toward its destination.

&quot;Spruance&quot; was relieved as flagship by on 9 October after having completed more than 170 boardings, and then started her transit homeward through the Suez Canal on 11 October. Once back in the Mediterranean Sea, the ship made port calls in Toulon, France; Alicante, Spain; and Rota, Spain. She returned home on 14 November.

In July 1994, as part of Operation Restore Democracy, U.S. Navy ships were assigned to helping to enforce the United Nations embargo of Haiti. However, so many Haitians were picked up from the sea that U.S. Coast Guard ships needed an assist from U.S. Navy ships in the region to handle the volume. Among these was &quot;Spruance&quot; which took onboard nine hundred Haitians for the transit to Guantanamo Naval Station.

&quot;Spruance&quot; transferred to Portsmouth, Virginia and entered drydock after the deployment.

In mid-1996, &quot;Spruance&quot; took part in the 24th annual U.S. invitational maritime exercise in the Baltic Sea, the BALTOPS 96 exercise. Made up of air, surface and subsurface operations, the exercise involved 47 ships and aircraft from 12 different squadrons sent by 13 NATO-member and Partnership for Peace nations: Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States.

&quot;Spruance&quot; steamed in the Mediterranean from April through October 1997 with the carrier battle group supporting . Serving as the flagstaff of Destroyer Squadron 24, &quot;Spruance&quot; made significant contributions throughout the deployment including: visiting thirteen foreign ports; participating in five multinational naval exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea; serving as Presidential Support Ship in Rotterdam, Netherlands; representing the U.S. Navy in Thoule Sur Mer, France, in commemorating the fifty-second anniversary of the Allied landings in southern France; and hosting Ukrainian military and diplomatic distinguished visitors during the 1997 Ukrainian Independence Day celebration. During that period, &quot;Spruance&quot; also took part in the Partnership For Peace Exercise &quot;Sea Breeze 97&quot; in the Black Sea. Sea Breeze 97 trained military forces on how to provide humanitarian relief for victims of a simulated earthquake in Southern Ukraine.

In the fall of 1999, &quot;Spruance&quot; detached from the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; carrier group to relieve as the U.S. representative to the Standing Naval Forces Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED). After dealing with the effects of Hurricane Floyd and Hurricane Gert off the east coast of Florida, &quot;Spruance&quot; crossed the Atlantic and entered the Mediterranean with other ships from the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; carrier group. STANAVFORMED is part of NATO&#x27;s &#x27;Reaction Force&#x27; and as such was ready to respond to any crisis in NATO&#x27;s area of interest, although its primary area of operations is the Mediterranean. &quot;Spruance&quot; was expected to remain assigned to STANAVFORMED through March 2000.

===2000s===

On 1 June 2000, &quot;Spruance&quot; became the first U.S. Navy ship to use the drydock in Jacksonville, Florida, in over ten years. She left Naval Station Mayport, Florida, early on 1 June, traveled up the St. John&#x27;s River to the drydock facility, and remained there until early August. During the drydock, the ship was raised out of the water, her hull was cleaned and inspected, and corrective and preventative maintenance was performed. On 24 September 2001, as part of the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Carrier Battle Group, &quot;Spruance&quot; commenced use of the Vieques Island inner range in conjunction with their Composite Unit Training Exercises (COMPTUEX). The exercise, which began the week prior, also utilized the northern and southern Puerto Rican operating areas, and involved complex battle group training events, naval surface fire-support training and air-to-ground bombing. COMPTUEX is an intermediate level battle group exercise designed to forge the battle group into a cohesive, fighting team, and is a critical step in the predeployment training cycle and prerequisite for the battle group&#x27;s Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) scheduled for early the following year. Successful completion of the COMPTUEX also certifies the carrier and its embarked air wing as qualified for open ocean operations.

&quot;Spruance&quot;, along with the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; carrier group took part, from 19 January through 26 January 2002, in Phase I of Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 02-1; and from 7 – 14 February in Phase II of Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 02-1. The JTFEX is designed to meet the requirement for quality, realistic training to prepare U.S. forces for joint and combined operations and also provides the opportunity to certify the CVBG for deployment. That particular JTFEX was scheduled for two phases to accommodate recent repairs to the carrier, which required it to be pierside during Phase I. The exercise took place in the waters off the East Coast, as well as on training ranges in North Carolina and Florida.

Deploying with the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; carrier group in June 2004, &quot;Spruance&quot; returned to Mayport on 7 December 2004. She decommissioned 23 March 2005. She was sunk as a target for aircraft-launched Harpoon missiles in the Atlantic Ocean off the Virginia Capes on 8 December 2006.

<text>Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield PC FRS (1634 – 28 January 1714) was a peer in the peerage of England.

==Personal life==
He was the son of Henry Stanhope, Lord Stanhope and his wife, Katherine Wotton. He inherited the title of Earl of Chesterfield on the death of his grandfather in 1656. He was educated by Poliander, Professor of Divinity at Leyden (1640) and at the Prince of Orange&#x27;s College at Breda. In 1669 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Laws by the University of Oxford.

His first marriage was to Lady Anne Percy, daughter of the Earl of Northumberland. Following her death, a marriage had been arranged between him and Mary, daughter of Anne and 3rd Lord Fairfax. Despite the fact the banns had been read twice, Mary jilted Chesterfield for the 2nd Duke of Buckingham with whom she had fallen in love. Chesterfield subsequently married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond and his wife, Elizabeth Preston. They had one daughter, Lady Elizabeth (from whom descends Queen Elizabeth II), but it is not certain that Chesterfield was the father. Elizabeth died in 1665, and he married a third time to the second daughter of Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, Lady Elizabeth Dormer, who finally provided him with two sons.

According to Samuel Pepys, Chesterfield was a ladies&#x27; lord, and had been one of the many lovers of Barbara Villiers, the most notorious mistress of King Charles II. His second wife, tired of his neglect, began flirting with the king&#x27;s brother, the Duke of York, and also with James Hamilton.

He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for wounding Captain John Whalley in a duel (1658) and on suspicion of involvement in Sir George Booth&#x27;s rising (1659). He also killed Francis Wolley in a duel on 17 January 1660, and fled to Holland. After having obtained pardon from Charles II, he returned to England.

==Career==
He was Lord Chamberlain to Catherine of Braganza (1662–1665) and a member of her Council (1670). He was Colonel of a regiment of foot (1667, 1682), a Privy Councillor (1681) and the Warden of the royal forests south of Trent (1679). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1708. He died at his home in Middlesex, and was buried in Shelford, Nottinghamshire.

<doc id="547914" wikidata="Q3183553" url="?curid=547914" title="Jones Beach Island">
<text>Jones Beach Island is one of the outer barrier islands off the southern coast of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York.

== Etymology ==
It is named for Major Thomas Jones, who first came to Long Island in 1692, where he proceeded to build the island&#x27;s first brick house near Massapequa. Jones built a whaling station on Jones Island near the present site of Jones Beach State Park in 1700.

Jones Beach Island is sometimes referred to as Oak Beach Island and is the former home of the infamous Oak Beach Inn. Because of the ephemeral nature of the various inlets, the name Fire Island is sometimes used to refer collectively to the various barrier islands off the south shore of Long Island, but usually refers specifically to the island across the Fire Island Inlet to the east.

==Geography==
Jones Beach Island is separated from Long Island by South Oyster Bay and Great South Bay, from Long Beach Barrier Island by Jones Inlet to the west, and from Fire Island by Fire Island Inlet to the east. It straddles the line between Nassau and Suffolk counties.

From west to east, Jones Beach Island contains the following communities and parks:

* Jones Beach State Park
*John F. Kennedy Memorial Wildlife Sanctuary, a Town of Oyster Bay wildlife preserve
* Tobay Beach, a Town of Oyster Bay beach
* Gilgo, a census-designated place
** West Gilgo Beach, a private gated community
** Gilgo Beach, a community and Town of Babylon beach
** Cedar Beach, a Town of Babylon beach
** Overlook Beach, a residents-only Town of Babylon beach
** Gilgo State Park, an undeveloped beach
* Oak Beach, a census-designated place
* Captree, a census-designated place
** Captree State Park

The southern side of the island is known for its beaches that face the open Atlantic Ocean. The best known of the public beaches on the island, Jones Beach State Park on the western tip of the island, is a summer recreational destination for the New York City area.

Jones Beach Island is accessible from Long Island on its western end by the Meadowbrook State Parkway to Merrick (with the Loop Parkway providing a spur to Long Beach), and the Wantagh State Parkway to Wantagh. The Robert Moses Causeway traverses its eastern end, linking to Babylon via the State Boat Channel Bridge and Great South Bay Bridge, as well as to Fire Island by the Fire Island Inlet Bridge. The Ocean Parkway connects all three causeways and runs the length of the island.

<doc id="547917" wikidata="Q253480" url="?curid=547917" title="Vanessa Amorosi">
<text>Vanessa Joy Amorosi (born 8 August 1981) is an Australian singer-songwriter. She has sold at least two million units in albums or singles worldwide.

Amorosi rose to fame in 1999 with the release of her debut single, &quot;Have a Look&quot;, which reached gold status in Australia. The following year, she achieved international success with her debut studio album, &quot;The Power&quot;. She performed at both the 2000 Olympic Games opening ceremony and its accompanying closing ceremony in Sydney. Her performance of &quot;Heroes Live Forever&quot; at the opening ceremony gained international acclaim. Performed at the closing ceremony, &quot;Absolutely Everybody&quot;, which became an unofficial anthem of the games, went on to be a major hit in Australia and many European countries including the United Kingdom and Germany. After a second studio album, &quot;Change&quot;, in 2002 and several years from the spotlight, Amorosi returned in 2008 with the release of her third studio album &quot;Somewhere in the Real World&quot;. The album&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Perfect&quot;, marked her comeback to the ARIA top 5 singles and was the most played Australian song on Australian radio for 2008. Her fourth studio album, &quot;Hazardous&quot;, followed in 2009 and is Amorosi&#x27;s second-best selling album in Australia behind her debut, &quot;The Power&quot;. It produced her first number one-charting single, &quot;This Is Who I Am&quot;.

She subsequently released three more albums: &quot;Back to Love&quot; (2019), &quot;Blacklisted Collection&quot; (2020) and &quot;City of Angels&quot; (2022).

To date Amorosi has received a total of 16 ARIA and APRA nominations. She has won an APRA award with &quot;Shine&quot;, a VIVA Comet Award for &quot;Best International Newcomer&quot; and an ARIA No.1 Chart Award with &quot;This Is Who I Am&quot;.

It was certified double platinum and became the longest charting Australian single by an Australian female artist. It remained in the ARIA Top 50 Singles Chart for over six months after its release. &quot;Absolutely Everybody&quot; was released internationally and reached the Top 10 in many European countries including the UK and Germany where it received a gold certification.

Following the success of the first two singles, Amorosi released two more singles in 2000. &quot;Shine&quot; and the double A-sided single &quot;The Power&quot;/&quot;Every Time I Close My Eyes&quot; became major Australian hits. Both were accredited gold by the ARIA Australian music industry. The rights to create a remixed version of &quot;Shine&quot; were purchased by the airline Ansett Australia, who used this version for a commercial. Amorosi was one of many celebrities to appear in the commercial. In Europe, &quot;Every Time I Close My Eyes&quot; was released as the fourth single from &quot;The Power&quot; and became her most successful song in Germany behind &quot;Absolutely Everybody&quot;.

From 29 April to 25 May, Amorosi supported Savage Garden for 16 shows on the Australian leg of their &quot;Affirmation&quot; World Tour.

Her album &quot;The Power&quot; reached number one on the Australian album charts. Amorosi received six ARIA nominations in the year 2000 awards and &quot;The Power&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot; in the ARIA Music Awards of 2001.

I am excited and enthused.&quot; On 22 November, it was announced that Amorosi had signed to Universal Music Australia.

Amorosi flew to Los Angeles to film the video for &quot;Hazardous&quot; with director Paul Brown (Prince, Alicia Keys), which was serviced Thursday, 17 December 2009. The single peaked at No. 29 on the ARIA Charts – a solid follow-up single to her first number 1.

It was announced that Amorosi would collaborate with Mary J. Blige, so Amorosi flew to Los Angeles on 1 February to film the music video for her duet with Mary J. Blige for the upcoming single &quot;Each Tear&quot;. The new version of the track will feature on an international re-release of Blige&#x27;s latest record &quot;Stronger with Each Tear&quot;.

On 4 March 2010, Amorosi announced &quot;Mr. Mysterious&quot; as the third single from the &quot;Hazardous&quot; album via newsletter. During March 2010 Vanessa Amorosi supported Rob Thomas on his Australian leg of the Cradlesong Tour, as well as performing headline shows for her fans separately.

&quot;Holiday&quot; was released as the fourth single off &quot;Hazardous&quot; and charted in the top 50 on the ARIA charts. The song is one of her favourite tracks on the album: &quot;Holiday is inspired by a fantasy of escaping to a far off island, warm weather, with sand at my feet, partying all night and dancing till dawn&quot;, Amorosi explains.

===2010–2012: &quot;V&quot; and its delays===

In September 2010, Amorosi revealed on her official Twitter account she was back in the studio again with MachoPsycho in London. In October 2010, she wrote to her mailing list announcing she was writing and recording in Los Angeles for her new studio album, which is described to &quot;push boundaries&quot; and &quot;may even shock people&quot;.

Amorosi&#x27;s first single &quot;Gossip&quot; from her forthcoming album &quot;V&quot; was released on 1 July 2011 and became the No. 1 added song on Australian radio in the first week, but did not chart in the ARIA Top 100 Singles. The second single &quot;Amazing&quot; was released 9 September 2011 and peaked at No. 83 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The song was featured on Channel 7&#x27;s AFL Grand Final ad which also resulted in Vanessa Amorosi performing at the AFL Grand Final in 2011. 2011 also saw Amorosi work on such campaigns as Proactiv, Headspace and Kids Helpline.

The tracklist and previews were already available in the Australian iTunes store, but on 3 November 2011, Amorosi announced her album due for release on 11 November would be delayed until further notice. In August 2012, Amorosi announced she was no longer with Universal Music, and would be looking to rebuild her career as an album artist. The album is still unreleased to this day.

===2012–2018: Dave Stewart and Recording &quot;Untitled Memphis Album&quot;===
In 2012, Amorosi began played several shows with former Eurythmics frontman Dave Stewart. After Amorosi&#x27;s performance on the &quot;Dave Stewart &amp; Friends&quot; show at the Troubadour in 2012, both became friends and later they talked about her love for gospel music and gospel arranging, as Stewart said in an interview with Noise11.com. She also appeared as a featured vocalist on Stewart&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot;.

In a June 2014 interview with APN, Amorosi said she was working on a gospel album and her fifth studio album, which she revealed would be &quot;completely different&quot; to her previous releases.

In August 2014, Amorosi was one of the stars of the Dave Stewart organized tribute event &quot;The Beatles&#x27; 50th Anniversary at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, performing the songs &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;, and &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Stewart announced on his website in April 2015, that he was writing new material with Vanessa Amorosi.

In 2017, Amorosi was featured on a duet with Australian singer-songwriter Jon Stevens entitled &quot;Something &#x27;Bout You&quot;, from his album &quot;Starlight&quot;, co-written and produced by Dave Stewart. Stevens was introduced to Stewart by Amorosi. She was also featured in the song &quot;Delicious&quot; with Canadian singer-songwriter Daniel Powter.

Amorosi recorded her new album in October 2016, at Royal Studios in Memphis, with Dave Stewart serving as the producer. She was in Los Angeles on 11 March 2017 for a photo shoot for the album, and has returned to Hollywood for post-production of the album.

On 13 April 2018, it was announced by director Jesse Davey that post-production had begun on a music video titled &quot;Wolf&quot; for Vanessa Amorosi.

=== 2019: &quot;Back to Love&quot; ===
In January 2019, a list of artists that contributed to Vanessa&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Back to Love&quot; album were announced. These artists include Aleena Gibson, Trevor Muzzy, Louis Schoorl, Jordan Palmer, Sarah Solovay, David Gamson, and Jon Levine.

In April 2019, Amorosi released &quot;Heavy Lies the Head&quot; as the lead single from her upcoming fifth studio album. Its release confirmed she was still signed to Universal Music Australia under a distribution deal, with a new independent label Angel Works involved as well.

In August 2019, Amorosi announced the single &quot;Hello Me&quot;, which was released on 6 September. The name of her fifth studio album &quot;Back to Love&quot; was also announced, which was released on 8 November 2019.

In November 2019, it was announced that Amorosi would be competing in Eurovision - Australia Decides in hopes of representing Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. Her song &quot;Lessons of Love&quot; finished 3rd.

===2020–2021: &quot;The Blacklisted Collection&quot;===
On 30 March 2020, Amorosi released &quot;Coming Down Off You&quot;, the first of a series of new songs, released weekly, every Monday, leading to release of &quot;The Blacklisted Collection&quot; on 26 June 2020.

On 26 March 2021, Amorosi released the EP &quot;Vol. 1&quot;, featuring six tracks of soul and gospel music. A second EP was released in June 2021.

===2022: &quot;City of Angels&quot; and Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras===
On 4 February 2022, Amorosi announced the released &quot;City of Angels&quot;, scheduled for release on 18 March 2022.

On 5 March 2022, Amorosi performed &quot;Absolutely Everybody&quot; at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras as part of American Express&#x27;s float.

On 5 August 2022, Amorosi released &quot;Good Times Are Coming&quot;, a stand-alone single to coincide with her performance of &quot;Amazing&quot; at the 2022 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony.

=== 2022-present: &quot;Memphis Love&quot; ===
In December 2022, Amorosi was seen recording with Dave Stewart at Bay Street Records in Nassau, Bahamas. In January 2023, she again confirmed that she will be releasing her upcoming record through Bay Street Records.

On 1 September 2023, Amorosi released &quot;Wolf&quot;, the lead single from her eighth studio album, &quot;Memphis Love&quot;, scheduled for release in November 2023.

In October 2017, she married martial arts trainer Rod Busby in The Two Pines Chapel (Lancaster, California), which was used in the film Kill Bill. The couple have a son, Killian, born in 2016.

<doc id="547918" wikidata="Q4768536" url="?curid=547918" title="Anne Lennard, Countess of Sussex">
<text>Anne Lennard, Countess of Sussex (&quot;née&quot; Palmer; 25 February 1661 – 16 May 1721 or 1722), formerly Lady Anne FitzRoy, was the eldest daughter of Barbara Villiers, mistress to King Charles II. She became the wife of Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex.

==Life==
Born Lady Anne Palmer in Westminster, she was the first child of Barbara Villiers, the only child of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, and the wife of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine. Anne&#x27;s mother was one of the mistresses of King Charles II. According to legend, Anne was conceived on the night of Charles&#x27;s coronation. This cannot be true as she was born two months earlier, but she must have been conceived about the date on which Charles assumed the throne at the Restoration. Both Villiers and the king acknowledged Anne as his daughter, and she was therefore known by the alias of Fitzroy, meaning &quot;son of the king,&quot; but she has also been suggested as the daughter of Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield, &quot;whom,&quot; says Lord Dartmouth, &quot;she resembled very much both in face and person.&quot;

On 11 August 1674, at the age of thirteen, Lady Anne was married at Hampton Court to her second cousin 15th Baron Dacre, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the King. On the same day her ten-year-old sister Lady Charlotte Fitzroy was contracted to Sir Edward Lee (raised from an early baronetcy to the Earldom of Lichfield two months before, and also a Gentleman of the King&#x27;s Bedchamber). Both the wedding and her dowry were paid for by Charles II. Dacre was subsequently created Earl of Sussex.

In the summer of 1678, Lady Sussex eloped from a convent in Paris with Ralph Montagu (afterwards 1st Duke of Montagu). He was successively the lover of mother and daughter (the Duchess of Cleveland and Lady Sussex). In a letter to King Charles, dated &quot;Paris, Tuesday the 28th, 1678,&quot; her mother wrote:

I was never so surprised in my whole life-time as I was at my coming hither, to find my Lady Sussex gone from my house and monastery where I left her, and this letter from her, which I here send you the copy of. I never in my whole life-time heard of such government of herself as she has had since I went into England. She has never been in the monastery two days together, but every day gone out with the Ambassador (Ralph Montagu), and has often lain four days together at my house, and sent for her meat to the Ambassador; he being always with her till five o&#x27;clock in the morning, they two shut up together alone, and would not let my &quot;maitre d&#x27;hôtel&quot; wait, nor any of my servants, only the Ambassador&#x27;s. This has made so great a noise at Paris, that she is now the whole discourse. I am so much afflicted that I can hardly write this for crying, to see a child, that I doted on as I did on her, should make me so ill a return, and join with the worst of men to ruin me.

Anne&#x27;s husband the Earl of Sussex was a &quot;popular but extravagant man&quot; who, by extravagance and losses by gambling, had to sell the estate of Herstmonceaux and others. Lord and Lady Sussex separated in 1688, and she was widowed in 1715. The dowager countess of Sussex died 16 May 1721 or 1722, and was buried at Linsted, County Kent.

==Issue==
The children of her union with Sussex were two sons, who died in infancy; and two daughters, who lived to adulthood, co-heirs of the Barony of Dacre:

<doc id="547919" wikidata="Q7872724" url="?curid=547919" title="USS Paul F. Foster">
<text>USS &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; (DD-964), named for Vice Admiral Paul F. Foster USN (1889–1972), is a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was commissioned on 21 February 1976 and decommissioned on 27 March 2003. She is now ex-&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot;, serving as a Self Defense Test Ship for experimental U.S. Navy weapons and sensors and the last &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer still afloat.

== History ==
As the initial &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer assigned to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; had many milestone firsts, including successfully firing a NATO Sea Sparrow missile, demonstrating the feasibility of landing H-46 helicopters, and determining the operational limits of the SH-3 helicopter.

Operating out of San Diego, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; became the first &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer to deploy to the Western Pacific in March 1978. The ship deployed again in 1979 and 1982, serving in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.

&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; joined Destroyer Squadron Nine and moved to its new home port of Long Beach, California, in August 1983. She became the Navy&#x27;s first &quot;all electric destroyer&quot; after major modifications at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which included the addition of a fourth ship&#x27;s service gas turbine generator.

On 29 August 1984, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; began its fourth Western Pacific deployment as Destroyer Squadron Nine&#x27;s flagship, with then Desron Nine Commodore, T.O. Gabriel and his staff embarked aboard, leading a five-ship surface action group and participating in several major allied fleet exercises.

During a fifth deployment beginning in August 1986 with Desron Nine as part of the Battle Group, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her performance in Operation Kernel Potlatch in the North Pacific and Bering Sea.

From July 1987 through July 1988, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; completed a regular overhaul at Northwest Marine Iron Works in Portland, Oregon. During the overhaul the ship received over 55 major ship alterations, including installation of the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System for Tomahawk cruise missiles, the AN/SQQ-89 Anti-Submarine Warfare Detection System, and facilities to employ the Navy&#x27;s most sophisticated submarine helicopter, the LAMPS MkIII.

&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; departed on its sixth Western Pacific/Indian Ocean deployment on 24 February 1989 in company with the Battle Group. Conducting operations in the northern Arabian Sea, she was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.

=== 1990 to 2003 ===
On 8 December 1990, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; departed Long Beach on its seventh overseas deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of &quot;Operations Desert Shield&quot; and &quot;Desert Storm.&quot; The first ship to fire Tomahawk missiles against Iraqi targets from the Persian Gulf, she was instrumental in the liberation of Kuwait and in winning the campaign. Deploying for the eighth time on 20 July 1992, she returned to the Arabian Sea, where she operated in support of Persian Gulf Operations-Southern Watch while participating in numerous bilateral exercises with Persian Gulf Nations.

During the ship&#x27;s ninth deployment, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; again served with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Carrier Battle Group and was the first ship on the scene to provide assistance to a burning ocean tug, &quot;Glorious City&quot;, putting out the fire and saving its crew of seven.

Upon returning from deployment on 20 October 1994, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; entered into a regular overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard where several of the latest technological weapons, sensors and engineering systems were added. A major change implemented during this overhaul was a retrofit of a berthing, to accommodate her first female crew members. After completion of overhaul, she moved to her new home port of Everett, Washington arriving November 1995.

During the ship&#x27;s tenth deployment which began 21 February 1997, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; was a part of the multinational force during Persian Gulf Operations, enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq.

&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; departed for her eleventh deployment on 27 January 1999. While serving as part of the Pacific Middle East Force, she participated in Operation Iron Siren, Eager Sentry, and Arabian Gauntlet. In addition, the ship conducted boarding&#x27;s in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq.

&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; departed for her twelfth deployment on 11 January 2001, where the ship once again conducted numerous boarding operations in support of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Her thirteenth and final deployment began on 18 June 2002.

== Decommissioning and Self Defense Test Ship role ==

&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; was decommissioned on 27 March 2003. In 2004, &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; was designated to replace ex- as a test ship for the Navy, a role she assumed in 2005. In support of this new role, the now ex-&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; was assigned to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division. She is the only ship of her class that exists as of 2025, as all of her sister ships were either scrapped or sunk after decommissioning. &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; (DD-968), the last remaining Spruance Class other than &quot;Paul F. Foster&quot;, was sunk to create an artificial reef off Cape May, New Jersey on 10 August 2011.

On 8 April 2011, Wired.com reported that ex-&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; had successfully used the Maritime Laser Demonstrator for the first time in a sea-to-sea target test, sinking a small inflatable motorboat at a range of one mile in rough seas.

On 17 November 2011, ex-&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; demonstrated the use of shipboard alternative fuel, while underway in the Pacific Ocean on a 50–50 blend of an algae-derived, hydro-processed algal oil and petroleum F-76. The ship arrived Thursday morning to the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Port Hueneme in Southern California after traveling for 17 hours on a maiden trip from San Diego.

On 18 July 2016, ex-&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot; performed a test launch of the LRASM Anti-ship missile from her Mark 41 Vertical Launching System while underway in the Pacific Ocean.

In December 2023, it was announced by BAE Systems that the Navy had contracted with them to refurbish ex-&quot;Paul F. Foster&quot;, extending her service life as self-defense test ship. Refurbishment took place between April and December 2024 at a cost of $22 million.

<doc id="547920" wikidata="Q2346374" url="?curid=547920" title="George FitzRoy, Duke of Northumberland">
<text>Lieutenant-General George FitzRoy, Duke of Northumberland, KG, PC (28December 166528June 1716) was the third and youngest illegitimate son of King Charles II of England (&#x27;Charles the Black&#x27;) by Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine (also known as Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland); he was the fifth of Charles&#x27;s eight illegitimate sons. On 1 October 1674, he was created Earl of Northumberland, Baron of Pontefract (Yorkshire) and Viscount Falmouth (Cornwall). On 6 April 1683, he was created Duke of Northumberland. He was described as &quot;a most worthy man&quot;, and as &quot;...a tall, Black-Man, like his father, the King.&quot; The same John Macky files described his half-sibling, Charles Lennox, Duke of Richmond as Black complexion, also like his father, King Charles II. 

The first Duke of Northumberland was born at Merton College, Oxford. In 1682, he was employed on secret service in Venice. Upon his return to England in 1684, he was elected (10 January) and installed (8 April) Knight of the Garter. That summer, he served as a volunteer on the side of the French at the Siege of Luxembourg. In 1687, Northumberland commanded the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards. A year later, he was appointed a lord of His Majesty&#x27;s bedchamber. In 1701, he was appointed Constable of Windsor Castle, in 1710 Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, and in 1712, he became Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire as well. In 1703, he succeeded the Earl of Oxford as Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse. Seven years later, on 10 January 1710, he became Lieutenant-General. On 7 April 1713, he was sworn into the Privy Council and as Chief Butler of England.

In March 1686, Northumberland married Catherine Wheatley, the daughter of a poulterer, Robert Wheatley of Bracknell in Berkshire. Catherine was the widow of Thomas Lucy of Charlecote Park, a captain in the Royal Horse Guards. Her sister married the Earl of Dumbarton. Soon after the marriage, Northumberland and his brother, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, allegedly attempted to privately convey her abroad to an English convent in Ghent, Belgium. After Catherine&#x27;s death in 1714, Northumberland married Mary Dutton, the sister of Cpt. Mark Dutton.

The Duke lived at Frogmore House at Windsor in Berkshire, but died suddenly aged 50 at Epsom on 28 June 1716. He had no legitimate offspring. His wife Mary FitzRoy, Duchess of Northumberland died at Frogmore House in 1738.

<doc id="547921" wikidata="Q276578" url="?curid=547921" title="George, King of Saxony">
<text>George (; 8 August 1832 – 15 October 1904) was king of Saxony and member of the House of Wettin.

==Early life==
George was born in the Saxon capital Dresden. He was the second son of King John of Saxony (1801–1873) and his wife, Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria (1801–1877), daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756–1825).

==Marriage==
On 11 May 1859 at Belém Palace, Lisbon, George married, Infanta Maria Anna of Portugal, eldest surviving daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal and her consort, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry, and the younger sister of King Pedro V of Portugal. Maria Anna died young and George stayed unmarried for the rest of his long life.

===Issue===
==Military career==
George served under his brother Albert&#x27;s command during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and in the Franco-German War. In the re-organisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris, his brother the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army (Army of the Meuse) consisting of the Saxon XII corps, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV (Prussian Saxony) corps and George succeeded him in command of the XII corps.

==King of Saxony==

Prince George was a Generalfeldmarschall before his ascension. It gradually became clear that George&#x27;s elder brother, Albert (1828–1902), and his wife, Queen Carola (1833–1907), would not have any children, thereby making George the heir presumptive to the throne. He succeeded Albert as King of Saxony on 19 June 1902, albeit for just a brief two-year reign. On 15 October 1904 he died in Pillnitz and was succeeded by his eldest son, Frederick Augustus III (1865–1932), who was deposed in 1918.

King George was a controversial figure. He divorced by royal decree his eldest son from his daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Luise. Luise&#x27;s flight from Dresden was due to her father-in-law&#x27;s threatening to have her interned in a mental asylum at the Sonnenstein Castle for life.

<doc id="547922" wikidata="Q191802" url="?curid=547922" title="Surudi Milli">
<text>&quot;&quot; is the national anthem of Tajikistan, officially adopted on 7 September 1994. It is derived from the anthem of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, composed by Sulaymon Yudakov in 1946.

==History==
Upon the country&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Tajikistan retained the Soviet-era regional anthem, lyrics and all, as its national anthem for a time before replacing the lyrics in 1994. This was in contrast to other former Soviet states like Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan that appropriated their old Soviet-era regional anthems as national ones but did so without the Soviet-era lyrics.

The lyrics were written by Gulnazar Keldi, and the music was composed by Sulaymon Yudakov. The melody is the same as that of the Tajik SSR anthem.

<text>PIPE Networks (also known as PIPE) is an Australian telecommunications company, based in Brisbane, Queensland. It is a subsidiary of TPG Telecom. Its primary business is setting up peering exchanges. PIPE itself stands for &quot;Public Internet Peering Exchange&quot;. The company also provides services such as co-location, telehousing, and fibre networks.

PIPE listed on the then Australian Stock Exchange on 17 May 2005 as PIPE Networks Limited with a stock code of: PWK.

Australian ISPs which use PIPE&#x27;s metropolitan fibre networks include, iiNet, Internode, and iPrimus amongst others.

In March 2010, shareholders accepted a takeover offer from TPG Telecom Limited.

In October 2024, Vocus Group proposed to PIPE Networks from TPG Telecom for $5.25bn 

==Peering exchanges==
PIPE currently runs six metropolitan exchange networks.

==PIPE International==
In January 2008, PIPE Networks announced it would be constructing a $200 million international link, known as PPC-1 (Pipe Pacific Cable), from Sydney to Guam. The link connects Madang in Papua New Guinea. It is operated by a newly formed PIPE subsidiary, PIPE International.

In April 2008, PIPE Networks entered into a joint venture with New Zealand-based Kordia to build an undersea fibre optic cable between New Zealand and Australia. This cable was to be known as PPC-2. As of 2024, this link has yet to appear.

==Takeover offer==

In March 2010, shareholders voted to accept a $373 million takeover offer by TPG Telecom Ltd. for $6.30 per share (TPG Annual Report 2010, p48). The takeover was subject to approval by the Queensland Supreme Court. Shares of TPG rose 11 per cent after the news was released.

<text>USS &quot;Kinkaid&quot; (DD-965), named for Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid USN (1888–1972), was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Launched in 1974, she was decommissioned in 2003 and sunk in 2004. She was the third &quot;Spru-can&quot; to be built.

==History==
Between the late evening of 22 February and the early morning of 23 February 1979, 25 construction workers from Texas, constructing a naval base in the port of Char Bahar, were evacuated in the early morning hours by &quot;Kinkaid&quot;, and they were brought to the small island of Bahrain. This became known as the &quot;Gulf of Aden/Yemen Indian Ocean Contingency Operation of 12/8/78 – 6/6/79&quot;. The crew of &quot;Kinkaid&quot; were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Armed Forces Humanitarian Service Medal.

In November 1989, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; and the Panamanian-registered freighter M/V &quot;Kota Petani&quot; were involved in a collision in the Strait of Malacca. The collision caused one death and 15 other casualties to the &quot;Kinkaid&quot;″s crew, and US$15 million in damages to &quot;Kinkaid&quot;. She made Singapore under her own power for temporary repairs, then Subic Bay, Philippines, then San Diego for permanent repairs.

On 4 July 1993, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; paid a three-day port visit to Acajutla, marking the first visit by a United States warship to El Salvador in more than a dozen years. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; was then assigned to Destroyer Squadron 13 in San Diego and was, at the time, conducting two months of routine operations under the operational command of Joint Task Force Four, located in Key West, Florida. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; returned to San Diego in mid-August 1993.

&quot;Kinkaid&quot; deployed on 10 November 1994, as part of the carrier battle group for a six-month deployment to the western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. She spent most of December in the Western Pacific. With the &quot;Constellation&quot; carrier battle group, she entered the Persian Gulf, on 11 January 1995, and departed it on 23 March. The &quot;Constellation&quot; carrier battle group conducted several exercises during the deployment, including Beachcrest 95, a routine annual exercise that included air combat, air control and air-to-ground combat support training in designated areas on Okinawa and Ie Shima; Nautical Swimmer 95-2 and Nautical Artist 95–2, naval air and surface exercises intended to improve interoperability between forces of the United States and friendly Persian Gulf nations; Beacon Flash 95–1, a combined naval tactical air exercise to improve readiness with friendly Persian Gulf nations; Eager Archer 95–1, an air training exercise between units of CVW 2 and Kuwait that provided dissimilar air combat training, formal joint strike training and in-flight refueling training for the Kuwaiti air force; and Sharem 110, a United States anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training exercise in the Gulf of Oman involving several battle group units. The battle group also conducted exercises with units of the Royal Australian Navy off the coast of western Australia. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; made its seventh deployment and supported the battle group by performing the anti-submarine warfare mission.

&quot;Kinkaid&quot; underwent a period of overhaul in June 1995. As a result of a reorganization of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 21. The reorganization was scheduled to have been completed by 1 October 1995, with homeport changes to be completed within the next year.
On January 11 1996 it deployed to the Persian Gulf. 
In mid-1997, as part of the carrier battle group, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; took part in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise 97-2 (JTFEX 97–2). The exercise was conducted off the coast of southern California and also included units from the Air Force, Army and Japan. &quot;Nimitz&quot;, from 20 July through 24 July, then conducted a warfighting demonstration called Surge Exercise (SURGEX), during which it demonstrated the firepower of the carrier/airwing team and its ability to sustain continuous operations in support of forces ashore in the initial four days of a conflict when a deployed carrier might be the only asset available to provide such support. During the exercise, , &quot;Kinkaid&quot; and practiced maritime interception operations. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; also escorted the civilian merchant ship &quot;Viking Serenade&quot; through the simulated &quot;war zone&quot;.

&quot;Kinkaid&quot; then deployed as part of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; carrier battle group. After Western Pacific visits in Yokosuka, Japan, and Hong Kong, a planned visit to Singapore was canceled when Iraq violated a United Nations imposed &quot;no fly&quot; zone. With &quot;Nimitz&quot; directed to proceed to the region immediately to reinforce Operation Southern Watch operations, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; arrived in the Persian Gulf on 12 October after transiting the Strait of Hormuz.

During &quot;Nimitz&quot;″s deployment in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; was accused by Iran of spying on its military exercises. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; was, however, in port in Bahrain at the purported time Iran claimed the spying was taking place.

&quot;Kinkaid&quot; returned on 28 February 1998, from a six-month Persian Gulf deployment. During the deployment &quot;Kinkaid&quot; served as Tomahawk ready strike platform, helped enforce the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq and conducted maritime interception operations.

&quot;Kinkaid&quot; was part of the &quot;Constellation&quot; carrier battle group, as &quot;Constellation&quot; officially relieved in the Persian Gulf in September 1999. The &quot;Constellation&quot; carrier battle group then spent the next 10 weeks in the Persian Gulf and conducted maritime interception operation boardings as well as flew combat air patrols over the Iraqi no-fly zones in support of Operation Southern Watch. During the period, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; rescued the merchant vessel &quot;Sima Star&quot;, a container ship, from sinking off the coast of Bahrain after taking on over 40 tons of water. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; sailors dewatered the fully loaded container ship, which was listing 15 degrees to the port side. After seven hours of battling poor ventilation and flooding below decks, &quot;Kinkaid&quot;″s rescue and assistance team was able to return the &quot;Sima Star&quot; to a five-degree list, allowing its crew to sail into Bahrain the following Monday morning for repairs. &quot;Kinkaid&quot; returned home on 17 December 1999, after a six-months deployment. During its 10-week patrol in the Persian Gulf region, the &quot;Constellation&quot; carrier battle group flew more than 5,000 casualty-free sorties, including nearly 1,300 in support of Operation Southern Watch. These flights included nine separate combat strikes and more than 43 tons of ordnance expended on various Iraqi air defense sites in response to Iraqi aggression against coalition aircraft.

&quot;Kinkaid&quot; began, on 15 March 2001, a scheduled six-month 2001 Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment while attached to the &quot;Constellation&quot; carrier battle group (CVBG) and Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The entire battle group had trained the previous six months in preparation for this deployment through a series of increasingly challenging exercises and operations. These pre-deployment exercises culminated in February 2001 with the successful completion of Joint Task Force Exercise 01–1. Over the following six months, battle group ships conducted multi-national and joint operations with the navies of various allied countries and visit ports in Western Pacific and Persian Gulf nations. The ships and squadrons were scheduled to return home in September.

==Sea swap==

The United States Navy Surface Force was scheduled to begin, in the summer of 2002, an initiative to test the effectiveness of deploying a single ship for 18-months while swapping out crews at six-month intervals. Called Sea Swap, this initial two-phased initiative would involve three &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers (DDs)—, &quot;Kinkaid&quot; and , and three destroyers (DDGs)—, , and . For the DD phase, &quot;Fletcher&quot; and her crew would deploy with their battle group this summer, but after six months, only the crew would return. The ship would remain deployed and be crewed by sailors from &quot;Kinkaid&quot;. After completing their training cycle and decommissioning &quot;Kinkaid&quot;, these sailors would fly to a port in either Australia or Singapore to assume ownership of &quot;Fletcher&quot; and steam her back on-station. After six months, they would be replaced by the crew from &quot;Oldendorf&quot; who would have completed the same training and decommissioning schedule with their ship before flying out to relieve the &quot;Kinkaid&quot; crew. After four more months on station, the &quot;Oldendorf&quot; crew would then bring &quot;Fletcher&quot; back to the United States where it too would be decommissioned. Additionally, by executing this plan, the Navy would be able to eliminate the deployment of because the additional on-station time generated by swapping out the crews meant a ship would already be in theater meeting that requirement.

<doc id="547930" wikidata="Q1665320" url="?curid=547930" title="Insular Cases">
<text>The Insular Cases are a series of opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1901 about the status of U.S. territories acquired in the Spanish–American War. Some scholars also include cases regarding territorial status decided up until 1914, and others include related cases as late as 1979.
The term &quot;insular&quot; signifies that the territories were islands administered by the War Department&#x27;s Bureau of Insular Affairs. Today, the categorizations and implications put forth by the Insular Cases still govern the United States&#x27; territories.

When the war ended in 1898, the United States had to answer the question of whether or not people in newly acquired territories were citizens, a question the country had never faced before. The preliminary answer came from a series of Supreme Court rulings, now known as the Insular Cases, which responded to the question of how American constitutional rights apply to those in United States territories. The Supreme Court held that full constitutional protection of rights does not automatically (or &quot;ex proprio vigore&quot;—i.e., of its own force) extend to all places under American control. This meant that inhabitants of unincorporated territories such as Puerto Rico—&quot;even if they are U.S. citizens&quot;—may lack some constitutional rights (e.g., the right to remain part of the United States in case of de-annexation) because they were not part of the United States. Today, many legal scholars such as José Julián Álvarez González, Christina Burnett, and others refer to the Insular Cases as a constitutional justification for colonialism and annexation of places not within United States boundaries. The Insular Cases &quot;authorized the colonial regime created by Congress, which allowed the United States to continue its administration—and exploitation—of the territories acquired from Spain after the Spanish–American War.&quot; These Supreme Court rulings allowed for the United States government to extend unilateral power over these newly acquired territories.

The Court also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the Constitution applied fully only in incorporated territories such as Alaska and Hawaii. Incorporated territories are those that the United States Congress deems on a path to statehood. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruled the Constitution applied only partially in the newly unincorporated Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. The Supreme Court created the distinction that unincorporated territories were not on the path to statehood, which effectively allowed for the Constitution to apply differently.

The rulings are widely considered racist. The &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; called the people of the insular areas &quot;alien races&quot; and the &quot;DeLima v. Bidwell&quot; ruling termed them &quot;savage tribes.&quot; The &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; case further suggested that &quot;the administration of government and justice, according to Anglo-Saxon principles&quot; of &quot;alien races&quot; &quot;may for a time be impossible&quot;. The District Court of the Virgin Islands called out the cases&#x27; &quot;racist doctrine&quot; and the era&#x27;s &quot;intrinsically racist imperialism&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1898, the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (which entered into force on April 11, 1899), which ended the Spanish–American War and granted the United States the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Additionally, Cuba remained under the jurisdiction of the United States Military Government until its independence on May 20, 1902. Since there was nothing in the United States Constitution about governing newly acquired territories, the government used the guideline from Title IX of the Treaty of Paris. Those that were born in Spain but living in one of the territories—known as —&quot;could retain their Spanish citizenship&quot;, or even eventually have the option to become United States citizens. Title IX of the Treaty of Paris did not grant the same rights to the indigenous population. Edguardo Melendez writes, &quot;Puerto Ricans and Filipinos—&#x27;the natives of the islands&#x27;—not only remained colonial subjects but became stateless peoples too: they were denied the right to keep their Spanish citizenship, as well as their right to become U.S. citizens.&quot;

After Title IX of the Treaty of Paris came the Foraker Act of 1900, which established American rule in Puerto Rico for all of the twentieth century. The act allowed the United States to appoint the governor, a portion of the legislature, and the entirety of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. These two documents precede the Insular Cases and set a precedent on the status of the United States&#x27; new territories prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s rulings.

In addition to the Treaty of Paris and the Foraker Act, the Citizenship Clause found within the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution informed the Insular Case decisions. Lisa Marie Perez writes in the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot; that &quot;[t]he Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that &#x27;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. However, the Insular Cases soon set a precedent that the territories are not inherently part of the United States and therefore the Citizenship Clause or other portions of the United States Constitution do not automatically apply. Furthermore, the Citizenship Clause was crucial throughout the 1800s in the United States as the country expanded and full citizenship was extended. Yet, the discussion never centered around citizenship in terms of overseas expansion. Soon, the precedent from the Insular Cases became very different from early interpretations of the Citizenship Clause.

== List of the Insular Cases ==
Various authorities have listed what they consider are the legitimate constituents of the Insular Cases.

Juan R. Torruella, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (the federal appeals court with jurisdiction over the Federal Court for the District of Puerto Rico), considers that the landmark decisions consist of six fundamental cases only, all decided in 1901: &quot;strictly speaking the Insular Cases are the original six opinions issued concerning acquired territories as a result of the 1898 Treaty of Paris&quot;. These six cases were:
* &quot;DeLima v. Bidwell&quot;, ; Argued: January 8–11, 1901; Decided: May 27, 1901
* &quot;Goetze v. United States&quot;, ; Argued: December 17–20, 1900; January 14–15, 1901; Decided: May 27, 1901
* &quot;Dooley v. United States&quot;, ; Argued: January 8–11, 1901. Decided: May 27, 1901
* &quot;Armstrong v. United States&quot;, ; Argued: January 8–11, 1901; Decided: May 27, 1901
* &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot;, ; Argued: January 8–11, 1901; Decided: May 27, 1901
* &quot;Huus v. New York and Porto Rico Steamship Co.&quot;, ; Argued: January 11, 14, 1901; Decided: May 27, 1901
Other authorities, such as José Trías Monge, former Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, states that the list also includes these additional two cases also decided in 1901:
* &quot;Dooley v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Fourteen Diamond Rings v. United States&quot;, ; Argued: December 17–20, 1900. Decided: December 2, 1901

Law professor Pedro A. Malavet wrote in his book &quot;America&#x27;s Colony: The Political and Cultural Conflict Between the United States and Puerto Rico&quot; that while many law experts include cases from 1903 to 1979, some scholars limit the number of cases in the list to just nine, adding &quot;Crossman v. United States&quot;, .

The U.S. Congress passed a resolution that collected the relevant records, briefs, and oral arguments of the 1901 cases concerning the U.S. Territories. In the compilation, the cases considered at the time of their decision as the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; were DeLima, Goetze, Dooley, Dooley, Armstrong, Downes, Crossman, and Huus.

Six of the nine Insular Cases deal exclusively with Puerto Rico.

Constitutional law professor Efrén Rivera-Ramos argues that the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; designation has been extended beyond the first nine cases in 1901 to include additional cases decided between 1903 and 1914:
* &quot;Hawaii v. Mankichi&quot;, 
* &quot;Gonzales v. Williams&quot;, 
* &quot;Kepner v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Dorr v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Mendozana v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Rasmussen v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Trono v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Grafton v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Kent v. Porto Rico&quot;, 
* &quot;Kopel v. Bingham&quot;, 
* &quot;Dowdell v. United States&quot;, 
* &quot;Ochoa v. Hernández&quot;, 
* &quot;Ocampo v. United States&quot;, 

Some include the later Supreme Court rulings of:
* &quot;Balzac v. Porto Rico&quot;, 
* &quot;Dorr v. United States&quot;, 

In &quot;Balzac&quot;, the Supreme Court found that Puerto Ricans, extended statutory citizenship by the Jones Act (1917), are not guaranteed a trial by jury, an inherent aspect of the United States Constitution. Similarly, in &quot;Dorr v. United States&quot; (1904), the Supreme Court ruled against right to trial by jury for Philippines residents, another unincorporated territory at the time. These two cases exemplify the idea implemented by the Insular Cases that the Constitution does not automatically extend to territories , or by its own force.

== Doctrine of incorporation ==
The Insular Case decisions created a doctrine allowing for the United States to acquire and govern colonial territories. The most important doctrinal lines from the Insular Cases include the idea of incorporated and unincorporated territories and the overarching principle that the Constitution does not inherently extend to unincorporated territories.

The first Insular Case, &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; (1901), created the distinction between incorporated and unincorporated territories. The Supreme Court came to this decision by examining Congress&#x27; right to impose tariffs on states and territories. Bartholomew Sparrow writes that in &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot;, &quot;the Court found that Congress could tax trade between Puerto Rico and the states. Puerto Rico was thus not a part of the United States for tariff purposes—contrary to the Uniformity Clause.&quot; Although the Uniformity Clause states that Congress must enforce tariffs equally throughout the United States, the Supreme Court created a distinction between territories that were fully part of the union and those that were not, allowing them to ignore the Uniformity Clause. The line drawn by the Supreme Court created &quot;incorporated territories&quot;, those destined to be states, and &quot;unincorporated territories&quot;, which were not on the path to statehood. In 1901 and the era of the Insular Cases, the areas that became unincorporated territories were Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. With the establishment of the legality of unincorporated territories, the Court also found that in these said territories, the Constitution &quot;did not apply in full&quot;. This means the Constitution does not extend &quot;&quot; (by its own force) to unincorporated territories. Instead, it could be extended at Congress&#x27; discretion. The lines of reasoning from &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; created legal precedent for the remainder of the Insular Cases.

In &quot;DeLima v. Bidwell&quot; (1901), the Supreme Court found &quot;Puerto Rico was part of the United States for the purpose of the Uniformity Clause.&quot; Therefore, duties could not be collected from Puerto Rico. The Supreme Court set alternative precedents in &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; and &quot;DeLima v. Bidwell&quot; based on the differing interpretation of the Uniformity Clause of the United States Constitution and the subsequent implications of these rulings.

== Political debate ==
The &quot;Insular Cases&quot; came at a time when America was building its empire. Throughout history, empire-building and colonial expansion have been a contentious topic. The reaction within the United States to the Insular decisions was no different, with both supporters and dissenters voicing their opinions. In &quot;Downes&quot;, Justice Henry Brown claimed that the United States should be able to possess the same power over the insular territories that Spain had. Krishanti Vigarajah argues that this allowed the insular territories to be seen as satellite colonies, and for the United States to exert colonial-style rule. This was controversial, due to the idea that the founding anti-colonial values of the United States were not compatible with exertion of colonial power.

The political debate surrounding the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; was split between expansionists and anti-expansionists, which largely followed Democratic-Republican party lines. Following the American Civil War and preceding the Spanish-American War, the Reconstruction Constitution that had guaranteed any inhabitants of American annexed territories the full benefit of United States citizenship and ultimate statehood. Historian Sam Erman notes that the strength of the Reconstruction Constitution had become weakened by the time of the &quot;Insular Cases&quot;, as a result of Southern Democrats&#x27; efforts to disenfranchise African-Americans in the South, and Republicans&#x27; waning support for Reconstruction measures.

For anti-expansionists, this discouraged overseas territorial acquisition during reconstruction by guaranteeing any annexed territories&#x27; eventual statehood and its people the full rights of citizenship.

Expansionists wished to separate U.S. action from the behavior of Spain, whose colonialism they viewed as motivated only by commercial interests and a continued desire to subjugate. The United States presented its own imperial ambitions as a path to liberation for former colonial subjects and an opportunity to gain republican government and modernity. However, expansionists also had to contend with questions about how to expand U.S. borders without extending citizenship to those they considered &quot;alien&quot;.

== American reaction ==
Bartholomew Sparrow notes that almost all of the Insular Case opinions were 5–4 within the Supreme Court, demonstrating the contentious nature of the topic even from the highest voice of law in the United States. In &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; (1901), the Supreme Court reached a decision after &quot;one of the most spirited discussions ever held within the sacred circle of the Supreme Court bench,&quot; the Associated Press reported.&quot; Reactions to the Insular Cases also exemplify the divide that existed at the time in the United States government surrounding empire building.

Republicans, who favored expansion and authored the Foraker Act supported the decisions: &quot;the decision is a complete vindication of the position held by the Republican party with respect to the power of Congress to legislate for Porto Rico and the Philippines.&quot; Additionally, John K. Richards, who as Solicitor General argued several of the cases for the government, said that &quot;they sustain to the fullest extent the so-called insular policy of the administration. The government now has the sanction of the Supreme Court for governing these islands as their needs require.&quot; 

However, there were many who did not support the decisions. Many former Representatives spoke out against the decisions. Charles E. Littlefield wrote in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; that &quot;the Insular Cases, in the manner in which the results were reached, the incongruity of the results, and the variety of inconsistent views expressed by the different members of the court, are, I believe, without parallel in our judicial history.&quot; Former US Senator and Representative George S. Boutwell commented that &quot;the opinion of the majority seems to justify the conclusion that the power of acquiring territories is an indefinite power.&quot; Thus, the divisive nature of the Insular Decisions was revealed through the opinions held by those active in government.

Outside of the government, the announcement of the &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; decision in 1901 drew the largest crowd in Supreme Court history, displaying the interest the American public had in the outcome of the case. Newspapers around the country also took great interest in the outcome of the Insular Cases, and many were highly critical of the decisions. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; wrote that the Supreme Court &quot;by a bare majority of one holds that the constitution is supreme only in the States, and that a million square miles, or one-fourth of the national domain, and ten million people are subject to no law but the will of Congress.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; exclaimed the &quot;Downes decision &#x27;at one fell swoop&#x27; brought the United States &#x27;into the ownership of colonies and putting us into the rank of land grabbing nations of Europe.

== Scholarly criticism ==

It is now commonly acknowledged that the decisions made in the Insular Cases were influenced by racist ideas of the period. Scholar Rick Baldoz notes that American political &quot;anxieties about immigration, race, and economic competition&quot; strongly influenced the debate surrounding the Insular Cases.

&quot;Downes&quot; and &quot;DeLima&quot; have been criticized for their inconsistency, and the alternative precedents sent in each one, in which Puerto Rico was first defined in &quot;Downes&quot; as not a &quot;foreign country&quot; but defined in &quot;DeLima&quot; as not part of the United States.

The &quot;Insular Cases&quot; have also been criticized for having been inconsistent in application between the two largest insular territories, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was seen as &quot;an important geo-strategic asset&quot; for emerging U.S. imperialism and a gateway to Latin America, while insular control over the Philippines was a &quot;temporary attachment born of political expediency&quot;. This was attributed to the relative geographic proximity of the two nations, and the relative commercial capabilities of each at the time.

Notably, American beliefs about race at the time also characterized the difference in treatment between Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Puerto Ricans were more likely to be viewed as white by Americans than Filipinos were. However, both Puerto Ricans and Filipinos were seen as too &quot;alien&quot; to be considered for U.S. citizenship and statehood, unlike other former U.S. territories that had achieved statehood. This has been criticized by scholar Mark Weiner as &quot;Teutonic Constitutionalism&quot;.

Writing in 2001, former Puerto Rico Supreme Court Chief Justice José Trías Monge contends that the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; were based on premises that would be legally and politically unacceptable in the 21st century, premises such as:
* Democracy and colonialism are &quot;fully compatible&quot;.
* There is &quot;nothing wrong when a democracy such as the United States engages in the business of governing other&quot; subjects that have not participated in their democratic election process.
* People are not created equal, some races being superior to others.
* It is the &quot;burden of the superior peoples, the white man&#x27;s burden, to bring up others in their image, except to the extent that the nation which possesses them should in due time determine&quot;.

Scholar Krishanti Vignarajah has also argued that the Court&#x27;s decisions in the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; could have been considered judicial overreach. They were initially considered a political issue, and the Treaty of Paris specified that &quot;the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories ... shall be determined by the Congress&quot;, but was later transformed into a legitimate judicial issue. This set a new standard for judicial involvement in issues of international affairs.

== Judicial criticism and later challenges ==
In &quot;Harris v. Rosario&quot;, , the Court applied &quot;Califano v. Torres&quot;, in a succinct per curiam order, holding that less aid to Puerto Rican families with dependent children did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because in U.S. territories Congress can discriminate against its citizens applying a rational basis review. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a staunch dissent, noting that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that the Insular Cases are questionable.

In &quot;Torres v. Puerto Rico&quot;, , cited above, Justice William Brennan, with whom Justice Potter Stewart, Justice Marshall, and Justice Harry Blackmun joined, concurring in the judgment, cited &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot;, 354 U.S. 1, 14 (1957), in which Justice Hugo Black said the &quot;concept that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our Government&quot;.

In &quot;United States v. Vaello Madero&quot;, , Justice Neil Gorsuch concurred with the majority opinion excluding Puerto Rico from the Supplemental Security Income program, but he criticized the Insular Cases and stated that they are &quot;shameful,&quot; &quot;have no foundation in the Constitution and rest instead on racial stereotypes,&quot; and &quot;deserve no place in our law.&quot;

The Supreme Court had the opportunity to overturn the Insular Cases in the case of &quot;Fitisemanu v. United States&quot;, but in October 2022, denied certiorari. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit had ruled in this case that the Insular Cases should stand.

== Impacts ==
The Philippines was recognized as an independent country in 1946, following World War II. Guam and Puerto Rico have remained unincorporated territories and are two amongst the sixteen existing insular areas. Baldoz suggests that U.S. rule over Puerto Rico as a result of the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; previewed attempts in the 20th century at American attempts at interventionism and occupation in Latin America.

The United States now has only one &quot;incorporated&quot; territory left: the United States Territory of Palmyra Island, a remote, uninhabited coral atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It had been part of the incorporated Territory of Hawaii until 1959, when Palmyra was deliberately excluded from the new State of Hawaii by the Hawaii Admission Act, so Palmyra was left as a remnant of the old federal territory, still &quot;incorporated&quot;, so the Constitution applies there in full.

For Puerto Rico, the outcomes of the &quot;Insular Cases&quot; laid a foundation for the modern &quot;political question&quot; of Puerto Rican status in relation to the United States, in which Puerto Ricans continue to be classified as alien. The incorporation doctrine&#x27;s &quot;uncertainty&quot; has allowed U.S. courts the ability to discriminate against Puerto Rican plaintiffs on issues of individual welfare and entitlement into the current day.

Amy Kaplan argues that the Insular Cases helped create the legal backing of the Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp in Guantánamo, Cuba, where constitutional rights &quot;remain indeterminate&quot;.

<text>Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) also formerly known as the Association of Thai Industries (ATI), came into existence on 13 November 1967, and was upgraded on 29 December 1987. It was a transformed body of ATI, which was created in 1967. FTI is a private sector organisation that brings together industrial leaders to promote Thailand&#x27;s economic development. The main objectives of FTI are to represent Thai manufacturers at both national and international levels, to help promote and develop industrial enterprises, to work with the government in setting up national policies, and to offer consulting services to members.

FTI cooperates with the government to mobilize Thai industries to reach international markets. It acts as a &quot;matchmaker&quot; between foreign industrialists and Thai resources which combine the financial strength, planning ability, and persuasive power of Thailand&#x27;s industrialists.

<doc id="547938" wikidata="Q7867510" url="?curid=547938" title="USS Austin (DE-15)">
<text>USS &quot;Austin&quot; (DE-15), was an of the United States Navy during World War II. The ship was named for Chief Carpenter John Arnold Austin (1905-1941) who was killed in action on board during the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces on 7 December 1941, and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

The second &quot;Austin&quot; (DE-15) was laid down on 14 March 1942 at the Mare Island Navy Yard as HMS &quot;Blackwood&quot; (BDE-15) for the United Kingdom under the terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement; launched on 25 September 1942: sponsored by Mrs. W. C. Springer; taken over by the United States Navy on 25 January 1943 and redesignated DE-15; and commissioned on 13 February 1943. The destroyer escort was apparently commissioned as simply &quot;DE-15&quot; for the name &quot;Austin&quot; was not assigned to her until 19 February 1943, six days after she went into commission.

==Namesake==
John Arnold Austin was born in Warrior, Alabama on 30 August 1905. He enlisted in the United States Navy on 20 November 1920 at age 15. Between that time and 26 July 1935, he served four successive enlistments. Serving as a Carpenter&#x27;s Mate 3rd Class (Petty officer third class), he reported on board the submarine tender then serving as a unit of the Asiatic Fleet. He detached from the tender and reported for duty on . On 4 December 1935, Austin was advanced to Chief Carpenters Mate (Chief Petty Officer). Detached from the heavy cruiser on 13 July 1937 and reported on board on 10 September 1937. He served in that battleship until detached on 14 June 1939 to proceed to further assignment to reporting on 18 July 1939. After 14 months on that destroyer tender, CPO Austin departed on 21 September 1940 bound for duty in and reported on board the battleship on 5 October 1940. In October 1941, Austin he received a commission as a (Chief Warrant Officer, W-2).

On the morning of 7 December 1941, Austin was on board &quot;Oklahoma&quot; which was the first ship to be attacked by the Japanese on Battleship Row, it capsized in only 15 minutes due to damage it received from torpedoes and bombs. Austin along with many crew members were trapped within the ship as it keeled over. After searching for a means of escape, he found a porthole beneath the surface that offered a way out. He assisted 15 sailors in escaping from the sunken &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. However Chief Warrant Officer Carpenter Austin failed to get out.

Austin&#x27;s remains were originally among those buried in the Halawa Naval Cemetery and Nu&#x27;uanu Cemetery on Oahu. After the war concluded, those remains were disinterred as part of an effort to identify individuals. Still unidentified, his were among the remains of 45 crew members from the &quot;Oklahoma&quot; that were buried under a shared marker at the National Cemetery of the Pacific. New forensic technologies led to the resumption of efforts to identify those remains in 2015. Austin&#x27;s remains were identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in September 2018.

===Navy Cross Citation===
The citation for his posthumous Navy Cross reads: 
The President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Navy Cross (Posthumously) to Chief Carpenter John Arnold Austin (NSN: 75565), United States Navy, for exceptional courage, presence of mind, and devotion to duty and disregard for his personal safety while serving on board the Battleship U.S.S. OKLAHOMA (BB-37), during the Japanese attack on the United States Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. When the U.S.S. OKLAHOMA capsized, Chief Carpenter Austin and a number of the crew were entrapped in one of the ship&#x27;s compartments. By his efforts, a porthole which was under water was located and he assisted fifteen of the crew to escape. The conduct of Chief Carpenter Austin throughout this action reflects great credit upon himself, and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.

==Service history==
Assigned to Escort Division (CortDiv) 14, the ship conducted shakedown training out of San Diego between 23 March and 23 April 1943. On the latter day, she put to sea to escort a convoy to Cold Bay, Alaska. She returned to San Diego on 11 May and began convoy escort missions between the West Coast and the Hawaiian Islands. Between mid-May and early September, &quot;Austin&quot; made two round-trip voyages between San Diego and Oahu and then a single, one-way run from the West Coast back to Pearl Harbor. On 2 September the ship left Pearl Harbor for the Aleutian Islands; and, on 14 September, joined the Alaskan Sea Frontier. For just over one year, &quot;Austin&quot; the cold waters of the North Pacific escorting ships between Alaskan ports, conducting patrols, performing weather ship duties, and serving as a homing point for aircraft.

The warship departed Alaska on 23 September 1944; arrived in San Francisco, California, a week later, and received a regular overhaul which lasted until 17 November. On 3 December, she once more weighed anchor for Hawaii. &quot;Austin&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor as a training ship with the Pacific Fleet Submarine Training Command until 20 March 1945, when she set out for the Central Pacific. On 1 April, the destroyer escort reported for duty with forces assigned to the Commander, Forward Areas, and, for a little more than two months, conducted anti-submarine patrols and air-sea rescue missions out of Ulithi Atoll in the Western Caroline Islands. She finished that assignment on 10 June when the ship left for the Mariana Islands. For the next four months, &quot;Austin&quot; operated out of Guam and Saipan. In addition to anti-submarine patrols and air/sea rescue missions, she escorted convoys to such places as Iwo Jima, Eniwetok and Okinawa. Following the cessation of hostilities in mid-August, she conducted search missions in the northern Marianas for enemy holdouts and for survivors of downed B-29 Superfortresses. The warship also patrolled Truk Atoll briefly before occupation forces arrived there in strength.

On 12 October, she departed Guam in company with the other ships of CortDiv 14, bound for San Pedro, California, and inactivation. On 17 November, she reported to the Commander, Western Sea Frontier, to prepare for decommissioning and, on 21 December 1945, was placed out of commission at Terminal Island Naval Shipyard. &quot;Austin&quot; was berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet until scrapped. On 8 January 1946, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. The Terminal Island Naval Shipyard completed scrapping her on 9 January 1947.

<doc id="547940" wikidata="Q57538" url="?curid=547940" title="John, King of Saxony">
<text>John (; ; 12 December 1801 – 29 October 1873) was King of Saxony from 9 August 1854 until his death in 1873. He was a member of the House of Wettin. During his reign, Saxony became a part of the German Empire.

==Early life==

John was born in Dresden, the third son of Maximilian, Hereditary Prince of Saxony—younger son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony—by his first wife, Carolina of Bourbon, Princess of Parma. During most of his life, John stood little chance of inheriting the Saxon Crown: he was preceded by his father and two older brothers, Frederick Augustus and Clement. However, in 1822 Clement died unmarried in Italy, and John was now only preceded in the line of succession by his older brother Frederick Augustus.

When his uncle Anton succeeded his older brother as king (1827), John became the third in line to the throne, and after his father Maximilian renounced his succession rights in 1830, John became in the second in line. John&#x27;s older brother became King Frederick Augustus II in 1836; now he was the first in line of succession to the throne. The King, married twice, was childless. John remained as heir presumptive during all the reign of his brother.

==King of Saxony==
John became King of Saxony after the death of his brother Frederick Augustus II on 9 August 1854.

The Judiciary Organization of 1855, the extension of the railroad network, the introduction of the freedom of trade are attributed mainly to his suggestion and promotion. Under his government, came the acceptance of the French Commercial Treaty (1862) and the acknowledgment of a contract with Italy. He exerted himself under influence of his minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust for the Great Germany Solution (de: &quot;Großdeutsche Lösung&quot;) of the imperial arrangement (under inclusion of Austria). In 1866 Saxony fought on the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War. Finally, after the defeat of the Battle of Königgrätz, Saxony joined the North German Confederation and in 1871 the German Empire under the hegemony of the Kingdom of Prussia. The King died two years later, aged seventy-one.

Beyond his political work, Johann was busy with literature. Under the pseudonym &quot;Philalethes&quot; he translated to German Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;; some parts of this work were placed in the Schloss Weesenstein. The Dresden district of Johannstadt was named after him.

==Marriage and issue==

In Munich on 10 November 1822 (by proxy) and again in Dresden on 21 November 1822 (in person), Johann married with the Princess Amalia of Bavaria (Amalie Auguste), daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. They had nine children:

#Maria Auguste Fredericka Karoline Ludovike Amalie Maximiliane Franziska Nepomucena Xaveria (b. Dresden, 22 January 1827 – d. Dresden, 8 October 1857), known as &quot;Maria&quot; died unmarried.

Stresa, 14 August 1912), known as &quot;Elisabeth&quot;; married firstly on 22 April 1850 to Ferdinando, Prince of Savoy and Sardinia and 1st Duke of Genoa, and secondly on 4 October 1856 to Niccolò, Marchese Rapallo.
#Frederick Augustus Ernst Ferdinand Wilhelm Ludwig Anton Nepomuk Maria Baptist Xaver Vincenz (b. Dresden, 5 April 1831 – d. Schloss Weesenstein, 12 May 1847), known as &quot;Ernst&quot; died unmarried and without issue.

<doc id="547943" wikidata="Q1195268" url="?curid=547943" title="Dreams Come True (band)">
<text>is a Japanese pop band formed in 1988 by Miwa Yoshida (lead vocals), Masato Nakamura (bass) and Takahiro Nishikawa (keyboards). Nishikawa left in 2002 to pursue a solo career. 

Dreams Come True has sold more than 50 million records worldwide. Their fifth album, &quot;The Swinging Star&quot; (1992), was the first Japanese album to sell more than three million copies, and for several years was the highest-selling Japanese-language album of all time. Nakamura composed the music for the Sega Mega Drive games &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992).

==History==
Dreams Come True was formed in 1988 by Miwa Yoshida (lead vocals), Masato Nakamura (bass) and Takahiro Nishikawa (keyboards). The band is commonly known as DCT and sometimes referred to as . Their first album, &quot;Dreams Come True&quot;, sold more than one million copies in Japan. Their fifth, &quot;The Swinging Star&quot; (1992), was the first Japanese album to sell over three million copies, and for several years was the best-selling Japanese-language album of all time. 

Nakamura composed the music for the Sega Mega Drive games &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992). In 1993, Dreams Come True recorded &quot;Winter Song&quot; for the opening theme of the Japanese version of the film &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and the following year recorded the song &quot;Eternity&quot; for the animated film &quot;The Swan Princess&quot; by New Line Cinema. In Japan, they recorded theme songs for programs produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System. The Walt Disney Company hired the band to create themes for their television shows, and attractions at the Tokyo Disney Resort. In 2001, the band performed &quot;Crystal Vine&quot;, the theme song for the Japanese version of &quot;&quot;, and Yoshida performed the dub of Audrey Rocio Ramirez.

Yoshida started a solo music career in 1995, and the following year appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. She has also appeared in advertisements for Sony, Visa, Honda, Shiseido, Lotte, Vodafone, and Coca-Cola. Nakamura was hired to compose the music for several television commercials, and around the same time compiled various Dreams Come True songs for Konami to be used in the game &quot;Dancing Stage featuring Dreams Come True&quot;, a spin-off of the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series.

On April 1, 1996, Dreams Come True released &quot;Love Unlimited&quot;, their final album for Sony Music. News of their departure caused Sony Music shares to drop severely on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They later signed with Virgin Music America and Toshiba-EMI in Japan, due to that label&#x27;s promises to break the group into the American market—something Sony was unwilling to do. Their first album under the new contract, &quot;Sing or Die&quot; (a title that half-jokingly described the band&#x27;s relationship with their former label, according to Nakamura), was released in an English-language version, but received little promotion or airplay.

Part of the failure of the Virgin-DCT relationship can be laid at the label&#x27;s attempt to renovate the band into something the American audiences could relate to. Yoshida took the stage name &quot;Miwa&quot;, Nakamura became &quot;King Masa,&quot; but Nishikawa remained the same, and only received a passing mention on &quot;Sing or Die&#x27;s&quot; liner notes. Musically, the album veered away from the classic DCT formula and deeper into the hip-hop dance theme begun on &quot;Delicious&quot; and &quot;Love Unlimited&quot;. The combination was not well received by American audiences, nor DCT&#x27;s legion of loyal Japanese fans. Dreams Come True left Virgin after the failure of &quot;Sing or Die&quot;.

Nishikawa departed in 2002 to pursue a solo career. Following his departure, he was arrested for assault and drug possession and received a suspended sentence. After a second arrest for possession in 2006, he was sentenced to prison.

Following 2001&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Girl Odyssey&quot;, DCT severed all ties with Virgin and Toshiba-EMI, and set up shop with Universal Music Japan. More recent albums such as &quot;The Love Rocks&quot; and &quot;And I Love You&quot; have returned to the classic DCT sound, and have been received more warmly.

The band released one more English-language album on Universal called &quot;Love Overflows&quot;, which were re-recorded versions of songs from &quot;Love Goes On&quot; to &quot;Monkey Girl Odyssey&quot;.

They have also been involved in charity events. Including the collaboration &quot;Zero Landmine&quot; with Ryuichi Sakamoto in 2001 to help raise funds for land mine removal agencies, and taking part in the Live 8 benefit concert in 2005.

On November 12, 2008, their single &quot;Tsuretette Tsuretette&quot; was released. &quot;Tsuretette Tsuretette&quot; debuted a top on the Oricon weekly charts, nine years ten months since their last number-one single &quot;Asa ga Mata Kuru&quot;. The song also appears on the band&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;Do You Dreams Come True?.&quot; The album is available in three versions: A single disc version, containing the main album; a second that adds &quot;Greatest Hits: The Soul 2&quot;, a sequel to their 2000 greatest-hits package; and a third that adds a live DVD, &quot;Winter Fantasia 2008.&quot;

Their DVD and Blu-ray of their 20th Anniversary tour is one of the first concert videos to be filmed with the RED One high-definition camera.

In 2010, they released their download only single &quot;Godspeed&quot;, where the title is meant to be an even stronger wish of &quot;Good Luck&quot; for everyone to listen to it. In November, they released their 23rd album, &quot;Love Central,&quot; their second on Universal Music Japan&#x27;s Nayutawave label. In 2016, Dreams Come True released their first complete greatest hits album, &quot;Dreams Come True the Ura Best! Watashi Dake no Dorikamu&quot;.

==Reception==
In a 2006 survey of people between 10 and 49 years of age in Japan, Oricon Style found the number-one selling song &quot;Love Love Love&quot; (2,488,630 copies) the second most popular Valentine&#x27;s Day song in Japan. The most popular song was Sayuri Kokushō&#x27;s 1986 debut single &quot;Valentine Kiss&quot;, which sold only 317,000 copies. The other songs in the top five were &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Radio&quot; from Yumi Matsutoya (1,606,780 copies), &quot;Happy Happy Greeting&quot; from Kinki Kids (608,790 copies), and &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; by Miles Davis.

<doc id="547947" wikidata="Q6469957" url="?curid=547947" title="Lady Barbara FitzRoy">
<text>Lady Barbara FitzRoy (16 July 1672 – 6 May 1737), was the sixth and youngest child of Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland, a mistress of Charles II of England. Charles never publicly acknowledged her as his child, as he was probably not the father. She became a Benedictine nun, known as &quot;Benedite&quot;.

==Early life==

Barbara was born at Cleveland House in St Martin in the Fields, London, England on 16 July 1672. Around the time she was born, Louise de Kérouaille was replacing her mother as the king&#x27;s primary mistress.

Although her mother insisted she was a daughter of the king, Barbara was probably fathered either by John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough, a second cousin of her mother, or Lord Chesterfield, whom she is said to have resembled in her features. Boyer in his &quot;Annals&quot;, published in the lifetime of the Duke of Marlborough says of Barbara:

&quot;I do not find the King ever owned her for his daughter; but a great man now living is her reputed father. [...] It is generally believ&#x27;d that Mr. Churchill, afterwards Duke of Marlborough, was her father.&quot;

Finally, it may be remarked that her mother&#x27;s husband, Lord Castlemaine, believed her to be his daughter, and bequeathed her his estate. Charles, however, always insisted on acknowledging her as his child, while disavowing her in private.

She and her mother were painted by Thomas Pooley in 1677. They are seen holding a basket of flowers; Barbara Fitzroy is portrayed as a smiling, round-faced five-year-old with blonde curls.

==Disgrace and the Monastery==

The king died in 1685. In March 1691, eighteen-year-old Barbara gave birth to the illegitimate son of the Earl of Arran, whom she named Charles Hamilton (1691–1754) who later became the Count of Arran. Charles went on to marry first Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon. John Campbell of Mamore and had a son christened William James (the surname was taken after his grandfather), but he died in infancy. The main reason for the name change was to distance him from the Hamilton family who had sent Charles out to France after the disgrace of his father&#x27;s affair and bastard child. While in France Charles Hamilton was styled Count of Arran. Elizabeth later died and Charles remarried Antoinette Courtney, daughter of Charles Courtney of Archambaud and had a son by her, Charles Hamilton James, Count of Arran (christened with the surname James as with his older brother) who returned to England and began a military career, finally settling in Dorset. Charles on returning to England went into the Army, became a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Scots Greys and was created a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath. He went on to marry Catherine, daughter of Sir Gerrard Napier, 5th Baronet of Middle March and had a son, who married firstly the granddaughter of the 3rd Earl of Aboyne and secondly the daughter of John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich he had issue by both. Arran&#x27;s parents bitterly opposed his relationship with Barbara. After giving birth, she became a nun in the English Priory of St. Nicholas, at Pontoise in Normandy, France, taking the name Sister Benedicta, where she later became prioress in 1721. Her son was raised by her mother, the Duchess of Cleveland, who supposedly disowned her.

An autograph of the Prioress is as follows:

&quot;Mon nom du monde est Barbe Fitz Roy est en Religion Benedite fille Du Roy De La grande Bretagne Charles 2dc j&#x27;ay fait profession dans Le Couuent des Benedictines Angloiscs De Pontoise L&#x27;annee 1691 Le 2* D&#x27;auril c&#x27;est maison est mittige.&quot;

Roughly translated as:

My name in the world is Barbe Fitz Roy, in Religion it is Benedicta, daughter of the King of Great Britain, Charles II. I made profession at the Convent of the English Benedictines in Pontoise, the year 1691, the 2nd of April. It is my place of penance.

The Lady Barbara died there in monastery on 6 May 1737, and lies buried in the church of the Priory.

<text>The clustering illusion is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable &quot;streaks&quot; or &quot;clusters&quot; arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random. The illusion is caused by a human tendency to underpredict the amount of variability likely to appear in a small sample of random or pseudorandom data.
Thomas Gilovich, an early author on the subject, argued that the effect occurs for different types of random dispersions. Some might perceive patterns in stock market price fluctuations over time, or clusters in two-dimensional data such as the locations of impact of World War II V-1 flying bombs on maps of London. Although Londoners developed specific theories about the pattern of impacts within London, a statistical analysis by R. D. Clarke originally published in 1946 showed that the impacts of V-2 rockets on London were a close fit to a random distribution.

==Similar biases==
Using this cognitive bias in causal reasoning may result in the Texas sharpshooter fallacy, in which differences in data are ignored and similarities are overemphasized. More general forms of erroneous pattern recognition are &quot;pareidolia&quot; and &quot;apophenia&quot;. Related biases are the &quot;illusion of control&quot; which the clustering illusion could contribute to, and &quot;insensitivity to sample size&quot; in which people don&#x27;t expect greater variation in smaller samples. A different cognitive bias involving misunderstanding of chance streams is the gambler&#x27;s fallacy.

==Possible causes==
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky explained this kind of misprediction as being caused by the representativeness heuristic (which itself they also first proposed).

<doc id="547959" wikidata="Q6179381" url="?curid=547959" title="Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin">
<text>Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin, originally &quot;Mette bor hos Morten og Erik&quot;, is a black-and-white picture book by the Danish author Susanne Bösche, published in 1981 in Danish and in 1983 by Gay Men&#x27;s Press. It was perhaps the first English-language children&#x27;s book to discuss male homosexuality. Jane Severance&#x27;s &quot;When Megan Went Away&quot; (1979) preceded &quot;Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin&quot;.

==Plot==
The story describes a few days in the life of a five-year-old named Jenny, her father, Martin, and his boyfriend Eric who lives with them. Jenny&#x27;s mother Karen lives nearby and often visits the household.

The book covers such small adventures as
* Jenny, Eric and Martin going to the laundrette together
* Jenny, Martin and Karen preparing a surprise birthday party for Eric
* Eric and Martin having a small quarrel and making up
* A woman expressing homophobic disgust when passing the family in the street. This is the subject of a later discussion between Eric and Jenny.

==Purpose==
Bösche has spoken of her motivation in writing the book:
Bosche asserts that she had no idea her book would stir up such controversy. She said that &quot;I didn&#x27;t know people would have that negative reaction. It was very sad what happened at that time.&quot; Also, the book was originally published in Denmark and there was no backlash against it there. Despite these intentions, the book has been categorized as &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot; by the tabloid press in the UK, which has led to much of its influence and even notoriety. 

==Political influence==
In 1986 various newspapers reported that a copy of the book was provided in the library of a school run by the Labour-controlled Inner London Education Authority (ILEA). A complaint was made to the Press Council regarding the press coverage as the book had not actually been made available to children, but only one copy had been purchased and made available to teachers through the Isledon Teachers Centre. The Education Authority had not approved it for younger children, and it was only supposed to be shown to older children &quot;in exceptional circumstances&quot; and following consultation with parents.

The availability of the book was condemned by Kenneth Baker, the Secretary of State for Education. In response to Baker&#x27;s intervention, Frances Morrell, the leader of ILEA, said that the very limited use of the book in local authority schools was consistent with the government&#x27;s requirements on sex education.

The resulting controversy made a major contribution towards the then Conservative administration&#x27;s subsequent passing of the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which forbade the promotion of homosexuality by local government (an article about Section 28 in &quot;The Times&quot; of May 29, 1988, notes the then-current notoriety of the book). This conservative backlash was partially motivated by a wave of homophobia in Britain that had been spurred on by the public&#x27;s growing fear of HIV/AIDS. Much of the conservative outrage against the book stemmed from issues that conservatives had with the photos used to illustrate the book. These were photos of Bosche&#x27;s daughter with two of her friends who lived in the same building.

In the United States in the 1990s, &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; became a similarly politicised book.

<doc id="547964" wikidata="Q1654327" url="?curid=547964" title="Classical Arabic">
<text>Classical Arabic or Quranic Arabic () is the standardized literary form of Arabic used from the 7th century and throughout the Middle Ages, most notably in Umayyad and Abbasid literary texts such as poetry, elevated prose and oratory, and is also the liturgical language of Islam. Classical Arabic is, furthermore, the register of the Arabic language on which Modern Standard Arabic is based.

Several written grammars of Classical Arabic were published with the exegesis of Arabic grammar being at times based on the existing texts and the works of previous texts, in addition to various early sources considered to be of most venerated genesis of Arabic. The primary focus of such works was to facilitate different linguistic aspects.

Modern Standard Arabic is its direct descendant used today throughout the Arab world in writing and in formal speaking, for example prepared speeches, some radio and television broadcasts and non-entertainment content. The lexis and stylistics of Modern Standard Arabic are different from Classical Arabic, and Modern Standard Arabic uses a subset of the syntactic structures available in Classical Arabic, but the morphology and syntax have remained basically unchanged. In the Arab world little distinction is made between Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic and both are normally called () in Arabic, meaning &#x27;the most eloquent&#x27;.

==History==

The earliest forms of Arabic are known as Old Arabic and survive in inscriptions in Ancient North Arabian scripts as well as fragments of pre-Islamic poetry preserved in the classical literature. It is hypothesized that by the late 6th century AD a relatively uniform intertribal &quot;poetic koiné&quot;, a synthetic language distinct from the spoken vernaculars, had developed with conservative as well as innovative features, including the case endings known as &quot;ʾiʿrab&quot;. It is uncertain to what degree the spoken vernaculars corresponded to the literary style, however, as many surviving inscriptions in the region seem to indicate simplification or absence of the inflectional morphology of Classical Arabic. It is often said that the Bedouin dialects of Najd were probably the most conservative (or at least resembled the elevated intertribal idiom morphologically and lexically more than the other contemporary vernaculars), a view possibly supported by the romanticization of the ‘purity’ of the language of the desert-dwellers (as opposed to the &quot;corrupted&quot; dialects of the city-dwellers) expressed in many medieval Arabic works, especially those on grammar, though some argue that all the spoken vernaculars probably deviated greatly from the supraregional literary norm to different degrees, while others, such as Joshua Blau, believe that &quot;the differences between the classical and spoken language were not too far-reaching&quot;.

The Arabic script is generally believed to have evolved from local cursive varieties of the Aramaic script, which have been adopted to write Arabic, though some, such as Jean Starcky, have postulated that it instead derives direct from the Syriac script since, unlike Aramaic, the scripts of Arabic and Syriac are both cursive. Indigenous speculations concerning the history of the script sometimes ascribe the origins of the script, and oftentimes the language itself also, to one of the ancient major figures in Islam, such as Adam or Ishmael, though others mention that it was introduced to Arabia from afar. In the 7th century AD the distinctive features of Old Hijazi, such as loss of final short vowels, loss of hamza, lenition of final /-at/ to /-ah/ and lack of nunation, influenced the consonantal text (or &quot;rasm&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an (and also many of its readings also) and the later normalized orthography of Classical Arabic as a standard literary register in the 8th century.

By the 2nd century AH (9th century AD/CE) the language had been standardized by Arabic grammarians and knowledge of Classical Arabic became a prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world, since it was the lingua franca across the Middle East, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa, and thus the region eventually developed into a widespread state of diglossia. Consequently the classical language, as well as the Arabic script, became the subject of much mythicization and was eventually associated with religious, ethnic, and racial conflicts, such as the rise of many groups traditionally categorized under the broad label of al-Shu&#x27;ibiyya (roughly meaning &quot;those of the nations&quot;, as opposed to Arab tribes), who, despite the remarkable differences in their views, generally rejected the stressed and often dogmatized belief that the Arabs, as well as their language, were far superior to all other races and ethnicities, and so the term later came to be applied pejoratively to such groups by their rivals. Moreover, many Arabic grammarians strove to attribute as many words as possible to a &quot;pure Arabic origin&quot;, especially those in the Qur&#x27;an. Thus, exegetes, theologians, and grammarians who entertained the idea of the presence of &quot;impurities&quot; (for example, naturalized loanwords) in the Qur&#x27;an were severely criticized and their proposed etymologies denounced in most cases. Nonetheless, the belief in the racial and ethnic supremacy of the Arabs and the belief in the linguistic supremacy of Arabic did not seem to be necessary entailments of each other.

Poems and sayings attributed to Arabic-speaking personages who lived before the standardization of the Classical idiom, which are preserved mainly in far later manuscripts, contain traces of elements in morphology and syntax that began to be regarded as chiefly poetic or characteristically regional or dialectal. Despite this, these, along with the Qur&#x27;an, were perceived as the principal foundation upon which grammatical inquiry, theorizing, and reasoning were to be based. They also formed the literary ideal to be followed, quoted, and imitated in solemn texts and speeches. Lexically, Classical Arabic may retain one or more of the dialectal forms of a given word as variants of the standardized forms, albeit often with much less currency and use.

Various Arabic dialects freely borrowed words from Classical Arabic, a situation similar to the Romance languages, wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from Classical Latin. Arabic-speakers usually spoke Classical Arabic as a second language (if they spoke the colloquial dialects as their first language) or as a third language (if they spoke another language as their first language and a regional variety of colloquial Arabic as their second language). Nonetheless, the pronunciation of Classical Arabic was likely influenced by the vernaculars to different degrees (much like Modern Standard Arabic). The differences in pronunciation and vocabulary in the regional Arabic varieties were in turn variously influenced by the native languages spoken in the conquered regions, such as Coptic in Egypt; Berber and Punic in the Maghreb; Himyaritic, Modern South Arabian, and Old South Arabian in Yemen; and Aramaic in the Levant.

==Phonology==
=== Consonants ===

Like Modern Standard Arabic, Classical Arabic had 28 consonant phonemes:
Notes:

:Sibawayh described the consonant as voiced (), but some modern linguists cast doubt upon this testimony. It is likely that the word used to describe it did not mean voiced but rather unaspirated.
:Ibn Khaldun described the pronunciation of as a voiced velar and that it might have been the old Arabic pronunciation of the letter, he even describes that the prophet Muhammad may have used the pronunciation.
:As it derives from Proto-Semitic *g, may have been a palatalized velar: .

:This is retrospectively reconstructed based on ancient texts describing the proper pronunciation and discouraging the use of any other pronunciation.

: is a marginal phoneme that only appears in , the name of God, Allah, except after or when it becomes unemphatic : &quot;&quot; (&#x27;in the name of God&#x27;).

: is emphatic except before , and when it becomes unemphatic .

===Vowels===

:Notes:
:* is the allophone of and after uvular and emphatic consonants
:* arose from two separate sources, often conflated:
:**The contraction of the triphthong . Some Arabs said &quot;banē&quot; (&lt; *banaya) for &quot;banā&quot; (&quot;he built&quot;) and &quot;zēda&quot; (&lt; *zayida) for &quot;zāda&quot; (&quot;it increased&quot;). This merged with in later Classical Arabic and most modern Arabic dialects.
:**A completely different phenomenon called imāla led to the raising of and adjacent to a sequence or , where C was a non-emphatic, non-uvular consonant, e.g. &quot;al-kēfirīna&quot; &lt; &quot;al-kāfirīna&quot; (&quot;the infidels&quot;). Imala could also occur in the absence of an i-vowel in an adjacent syllable. It was considered acceptable Classical Arabic by Sibawayh, and still occurs in numerous modern Arabic dialects, particularly the urban dialects of the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean.
:* [] may have been the original pronunciation of a final ی which is otherwise pronounced as []. In the Kisā&#x27;i and Hamzah recitations of the Qur&#x27;an, this pronunciation is used, whereas in the Hafs pronunciation is used instead. An example of this can be seen in the names Mūsā (Moses), &#x27;īsā (Jesus), and Yahyā (John), which would be pronounced as Musē, &#x27;īsē and Yahyē in the former two manners of recitation.

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
==== Case ====
The A1 inscription dated to the 3rd or 4th century AD in the Greek alphabet in a dialect showing affinities to that of the Safaitic inscriptions shows that short final high vowels had been lost in at least some dialects of Old Arabic at that time, obliterating the distinction between nominative and genitive case in the singular, leaving the accusative the only marked case:

Classical Arabic however, shows a far more archaic system, essentially identical with that of Proto-Arabic:

==== State ====
The definite article spread areally among the Central Semitic languages and it would seem that Proto-Arabic lacked any overt marking of definiteness. Besides dialects with no definite article, the Safaitic inscriptions exhibit about four different article forms, ordered by frequency: &quot;h-&quot;, &quot;ʾ-&quot;, &quot;ʾl-&quot;, and &quot;hn-&quot;. The Old Arabic of the Nabataean inscriptions exhibits almost exclusively the form &quot;ʾl-&quot;. Unlike the Classical Arabic article, the Old Arabic &quot;ʾl&quot; almost never exhibits the assimilation of the coda to the coronals; the same situation is attested in the Graeco-Arabica, but in A1 the coda assimilates to the following &quot;d&quot;, αδαυρα *&quot;ʾad-dawra&quot; &#x27;the region&#x27;.

In Classical Arabic, the definite article takes the form &quot;al-&quot;, with the coda of the article exhibiting assimilation to the following dental and denti-alveolar consonants. Note the inclusion of palatal , which alone among the palatal consonants exhibits assimilation, indicating that assimilation ceased to be productive before that consonant shifted from Old Arabic :

=== Verbs ===
==== Barth-Ginsberg alternation ====
Proto-Central Semitic, Proto-Arabic, various forms of Old Arabic, and some modern Najdi dialects to this day have alternation in the performative vowel of the prefix conjugation, depending on the stem vowel of the verb. Early forms of Classical Arabic allowed this alternation, but later forms of Classical Arabic levelled the /a/ allomorph:

<text>In biochemistry, isomerases are a general class of enzymes that convert a molecule from one isomer to another. Isomerases facilitate intramolecular rearrangements in which bonds are broken and formed. The general form of such a reaction is as follows:

:formula_1

There is only one substrate yielding one product. This product has the same molecular formula as the substrate but differs in bond connectivity or spatial arrangement. Isomerases catalyze reactions across many biological processes, such as in glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism.

==Isomerization==

Isomerases catalyze changes within one molecule. They convert one isomer to another, meaning that the end product has the same molecular formula but a different physical structure. Isomers themselves exist in many varieties but can generally be classified as structural isomers or stereoisomers. Structural isomers have a different ordering of bonds and/or different bond connectivity from one another, as in the case of hexane and its four other isomeric forms (2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane).

Stereoisomers have the same ordering of individual bonds and the same connectivity but the three-dimensional arrangement of bonded atoms differ. For example, 2-butene exists in two isomeric forms: &quot;cis&quot;-2-butene and &quot;trans&quot;-2-butene. The sub-categories of isomerases containing racemases, epimerases and cis-trans isomers are examples of enzymes catalyzing the interconversion of stereoisomers. Intramolecular lyases, oxidoreductases and transferases catalyze the interconversion of structural isomers.

The prevalence of each isomer in nature depends in part on the isomerization energy, the difference in energy between isomers. Isomers close in energy can interconvert easily and are often seen in comparable proportions. The isomerization energy, for example, for converting from a stable &quot;cis&quot; isomer to the less stable &quot;trans&quot; isomer is greater than for the reverse reaction, explaining why in the absence of isomerases or an outside energy source such as ultraviolet radiation a given &quot;cis&quot; isomer tends to be present in greater amounts than the &quot;trans&quot; isomer. Isomerases can increase the reaction rate by lowering the isomerization energy.

Calculating isomerase kinetics from experimental data can be more difficult than for other enzymes because the use of product inhibition experiments is impractical. That is, isomerization is not an irreversible reaction since a reaction vessel will contain one substrate and one product so the typical simplified model for calculating reaction kinetics does not hold. There are also practical difficulties in determining the rate-determining step at high concentrations in a single isomerization. Instead, tracer perturbation can overcome these technical difficulties if there are two forms of the unbound enzyme. This technique uses isotope exchange to measure indirectly the interconversion of the free enzyme between its two forms. The radiolabeled substrate and product diffuse in a time-dependent manner. When the system reaches equilibrium the addition of unlabeled substrate perturbs or unbalances it. As equilibrium is established again, the radiolabeled substrate and product are tracked to determine energetic information.

The earliest use of this technique elucidated the kinetics and mechanism underlying the action of phosphoglucomutase, favoring the model of indirect transfer of phosphate with one intermediate and the direct transfer of glucose. This technique was then adopted to study the profile of proline racemase and its two states: the form which isomerizes L-proline and the other for D-proline. At high concentrations it was shown that the transition state in this interconversion is rate-limiting and that these enzyme forms may differ just in the protonation at the acidic and basic groups of the active site.

==Nomenclature==
Generally, &quot;the names of isomerases are formed as &quot;&quot;substrate&quot; isomerase&quot; (for example, enoyl CoA isomerase), or as &quot;&quot;substrate&quot; &quot;type of isomerase&quot;&quot; (for example, phosphoglucomutase).&quot;

==Classification==
Enzyme-catalyzed reactions each have a uniquely assigned classification number. Isomerase-catalyzed reactions have their own EC category: EC 5. Isomerases are further classified into six subclasses:

===Racemases, epimerases===
This category (EC 5.1) includes (racemases) and epimerases). These isomerases invert stereochemistry at the target chiral carbon. Racemases act upon molecules with one chiral carbon for inversion of stereochemistry, whereas epimerases target molecules with multiple chiral carbons and act upon one of them. A molecule with only one chiral carbon has two enantiomeric forms, such as serine having the isoforms D-serine and L-serine differing only in the absolute configuration about the chiral carbon. A molecule with multiple chiral carbons has two forms at each chiral carbon. Isomerization at one chiral carbon of several yields epimers, which differ from one another in absolute configuration at just one chiral carbon. For example, D-glucose and D-mannose differ in configuration at just one chiral carbon. This class is further broken down by the group the enzyme acts upon:

===Cis-trans isomerases===
This category (EC 5.2) includes enzymes that catalyze the isomerization of cis-trans isomers. Alkenes and cycloalkanes may have cis-trans stereoisomers. These isomers are not distinguished by absolute configuration but rather by the position of substituent groups relative to a plane of reference, as across a double bond or relative to a ring structure. &quot;Cis&quot; isomers have substituent groups on the same side and &quot;trans&quot; isomers have groups on opposite sides.

This category is not broken down any further. All entries presently include:


===Intramolecular oxidoreductases===
This category (EC 5.3) includes intramolecular oxidoreductases. These isomerases catalyze the transfer of electrons from one part of the molecule to another. In other words, they catalyze the oxidation of one part of the molecule and the concurrent reduction of another part. Sub-categories of this class are:

===Intramolecular transferases===
This category (EC 5.4) includes intramolecular transferases (mutases). These isomerases catalyze the transfer of functional groups from one part of a molecule to another. Phosphotransferases (EC 5.4.2) were categorized as transferases (EC 2.7.5) with regeneration of donors until 1983. This sub-class can be broken down according to the functional group the enzyme transfers:

===Intramolecular lyases===
This category (EC 5.5) includes intramolecular lyases. These enzymes catalyze &quot;reactions in which a group can be regarded as eliminated from one part of a molecule, leaving a double bond, while remaining covalently attached to the molecule.&quot; Some of these catalyzed reactions involve the breaking of a ring structure.

This category is not broken down any further. All entries presently include:

==Mechanisms of isomerases==

===Ring expansion and contraction via tautomers===

A classic example of ring opening and contraction is the isomerization of glucose (an aldehyde with a six-membered ring) to fructose (a ketone with a five-membered ring). The conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate to D-fructose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, an intramolecular oxidoreductase. The overall reaction involves the opening of the ring to form an aldose via acid/base catalysis and the subsequent formation of a cis-endiol intermediate. A ketose is then formed and the ring is closed again.

Glucose-6-phosphate first binds to the active site of the isomerase. The isomerase opens the ring: its His388 residue protonates the oxygen on the glucose ring (and thereby breaking the O5-C1 bond) in conjunction with Lys518 deprotonating the C1 hydroxyl oxygen. The ring opens to form a straight-chain aldose with an acidic C2 proton. The C3-C4 bond rotates and Glu357 (assisted by His388) depronates C2 to form a double bond between C1 and C2. A cis-endiol intermediate is created and the C1 oxygen is protonated by the catalytic residue, accompanied by the deprotonation of the endiol C2 oxygen. The straight-chain ketose is formed. To close the fructose ring, the reverse of ring opening occurs and the ketose is protonated.

===Epimerization===

An example of epimerization is found in the Calvin cycle when D-ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into D-xylulose-5-phosphate by ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase. The substrate and product differ only in stereochemistry at the third carbon in the chain. The underlying mechanism involves the deprotonation of that third carbon to form a reactive enolate intermediate. The enzyme&#x27;s active site contains two Asp residues. After the substrate binds to the enzyme, the first Asp deprotonates the third carbon from one side of the molecule. This leaves a planar sp2-hybridized intermediate. The second Asp is located on the opposite side of the active side and it protonates the molecule, effectively adding a proton from the back side. These coupled steps invert stereochemistry at the third carbon.

===Intramolecular transfer===

Chorismate mutase is an intramolecular transferase and it catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to prephenate, used as a precursor for L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine in some plants and bacteria. This reaction is a Claisen rearrangement that can proceed with or without the isomerase, though the rate increases 106 fold in the presence of chorismate mutase. The reaction goes through a chair transition state with the substrate in a trans-diaxial position. Experimental evidence indicates that the isomerase selectively binds the chair transition state, though the exact mechanism of catalysis is not known. It is thought that this binding stabilizes the transition state through electrostatic effects, accounting for the dramatic increase in the reaction rate in the presence of the mutase or upon addition of a specifically-placed cation in the active site.

===Intramolecular oxidoreduction===

Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase type I (also known as IPP isomerase) is seen in cholesterol synthesis and in particular it catalyzes the conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In this isomerization reaction a stable carbon-carbon double bond is rearranged top create a highly electrophilic allylic isomer. IPP isomerase catalyzes this reaction by the stereoselective antarafacial transposition of a single proton. The double bond is protonated at C4 to form a tertiary carbocation intermediate at C3. The adjacent carbon, C2, is deprotonated from the opposite face to yield a double bond. In effect, the double bond is shifted over.

==The role of isomerase in human disease==
Isomerase plays a role in human disease. Deficiencies of this enzyme can cause disorders in humans.

===Phosphohexose isomerase deficiency===
Phosphohexose Isomerase Deficiency (PHI) is also known as phosphoglucose isomerase deficiency or Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase deficiency, and is a hereditary enzyme deficiency. PHI is the second most frequent erthoenzyopathy in glycolysis besides pyruvate kinase deficiency, and is associated with non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia of variable severity. This disease is centered on the glucose-6-phosphate protein. This protein can be found in the secretion of some cancer cells. PHI is the result of a dimeric enzyme that catalyses the reversible interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and gluose-6-phosphate.

PHI is a very rare disease with only 50 cases reported in literature to date.

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical picture in association with biochemical studies revealing erythrocyte GPI deficiency (between 7 and 60% of normal) and identification of a mutation in the GPI gene by molecular analysis.

The deficiency of phosphohexose isomerase can lead to a condition referred to as hemolytic syndrome. As in humans, the hemolytic syndrome, which is characterized by a diminished erythrocyte number, lower hematocrit, lower hemoglobin, higher number of reticulocytes and plasma bilirubin concentration, as well as increased liver- and spleen-somatic indices, was exclusively manifested in homozygous mutants.

===Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency===
The disease referred to as triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (TPI), is a severe autosomal recessive inherited multisystem disorder of glycolytic metabolism. It is characterized by hemolytic anemia and neurodegeneration, and is caused by anaerobic metabolic dysfunction. This dysfunction results from a missense mutation that effects the encoded TPI protein. The most common mutation is the substitution of gene, Glu104Asp, which produces the most severe phenotype, and is responsible for approximately 80% of clinical TPI deficiency.

TPI deficiency is very rare with less than 50 cases reported in literature. Being an autosomal recessive inherited disease, TPI deficiency has a 25% recurrence risk in the case of heterozygous parents. It is a congenital disease that most often occurs with hemolytic anemia and manifests with jaundice. Most patients with TPI for Glu104Asp mutation or heterozygous for a TPI null allele and Glu104Asp have a life expectancy of infancy to early childhood. TPI patients with other mutations generally show longer life expectancy. There are only two cases of individuals with TPI living beyond the age of 6. These cases involve two brothers from Hungary, one who did not develop neurological symptoms until the age of 12, and the older brother who has no neurological symptoms and suffers from anemia only.

Individuals with TPI show obvious symptoms after 6–24 months of age. These symptoms include: dystonia, tremor, dyskinesia, pyramidal tract signs, cardiomyopathy and spinal motor neuron involvement. Patients also show frequent respiratory system bacterial infections.

TPI is detected through deficiency of enzymatic activity and the build-up of dihyroxyacetone phosphate(DHAP), which is a toxic substrate, in erythrocytes. This can be detected through physical examination and a series of lab work. In detection, there is generally myopathic changes seen in muscles and chronic axonal neuropathy found in the nerves. Diagnosis of TPI can be confirmed through molecular genetics. Chorionic villus DNA analysis or analysis of fetal red cells can be used to detect TPI in antenatal diagnosis.

Treatment for TPI is not specific, but varies according to different cases. Because of the range of symptoms TPI causes, a team of specialist may be needed to provide treatment to a single individual. That team of specialists would consists of pediatricians, cardiologists, neurologists, and other healthcare professionals, that can develop a comprehensive plan of action.

Supportive measures such as red cell transfusions in cases of severe anaemia can be taken to treat TPI as well. In some cases, spleen
removal (splenectomy) may improve the anaemia. There is no treatment to prevent progressive
neurological impairment of any other non-haematological clinical manifestation of the diseases.

==Industrial applications==
By far the most common use of isomerases in industrial applications is in sugar manufacturing. Glucose isomerase (also known as xylose isomerase) catalyzes the conversion of D-xylose and D-glucose to D-xylulose and D-fructose. Like most sugar isomerases, glucose isomerase catalyzes the interconversion of aldoses and ketoses.

The conversion of glucose to fructose is a key component of high-fructose corn syrup production. Isomerization is more specific than older chemical methods of fructose production, resulting in a higher yield of fructose and no side products. The fructose produced from this isomerization reaction is purer with no residual flavors from contaminants. High-fructose corn syrup is preferred by many confectionery and soda manufacturers because of the high sweetening power of fructose (twice that of sucrose), its relatively low cost and its inability to crystallize. Fructose is also used as a sweetener for use by diabetics. Major issues of the use of glucose isomerase involve its inactivation at higher temperatures and the requirement for a high pH (between 7.0 and 9.0) in the reaction environment. Moderately high temperatures, above 70 °C, increase the yield of fructose by at least half in the isomerization step. The enzyme requires a divalent cation such as Co2+ and Mg2+ for peak activity, an additional cost to manufacturers. Glucose isomerase also has a much higher affinity for xylose than for glucose, necessitating a carefully controlled environment.

The isomerization of xylose to xylulose has its own commercial applications as interest in biofuels has increased. This reaction is often seen naturally in bacteria that feed on decaying plant matter. Its most common industrial use is in the production of ethanol, achieved by the fermentation of xylulose. The use of hemicellulose as source material is very common. Hemicellulose contains xylan, which itself is composed of xylose in β(1,4) linkages. The use of glucose isomerase very efficiently converts xylose to xylulose, which can then be acted upon by fermenting yeast. Overall, extensive research in genetic engineering has been invested into optimizing glucose isomerase and facilitating its recovery from industrial applications for re-use.

Glucose isomerase is able to catalyze the isomerization of a range of other sugars, including D-ribose, D-allose and L-arabinose. The most efficient substrates are those similar to glucose and xylose, having equatorial hydroxyl groups at the third and fourth carbons. The current model for the mechanism of glucose isomerase is that of a hydride shift based on X-ray crystallography and isotope exchange studies.

==Membrane-associated isomerases==
Some isomerases associate with biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or anchored through a single transmembrane helix, for example isomerases with the thioredoxin domain, and certain prolyl isomerases.

<text>The stone pine, botanical name Pinus pinea, also known as the Italian stone pine, Mediterranean stone pine, umbrella pine and parasol pine, is a tree from the pine family (&quot;Pinaceae&quot;). The tree is native to the Mediterranean region, occurring in Southern Europe and the Levant. The species was introduced into North Africa millennia ago, and is also naturalized in the Canary Islands, South Africa and New South Wales.

Stone pines have been used and cultivated for their edible pine nuts since prehistoric times. They are widespread in horticultural cultivation as ornamental trees, planted in gardens and parks around the world. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&quot;Pinus pinea&quot; is a diagnostic species of the vegetation class &quot;Pinetea halepensis&quot;.

==Description==
The stone pine is a coniferous evergreen tree that can exceed in height, but is more typical. In youth, it is a bushy globe, in mid-age an umbrella canopy on a thick trunk, and, in maturity, a broad and flat crown over in width. The bark is thick, red-brown and deeply fissured into broad vertical plates.

;Foliage
The flexible mid-green leaves are needle-like, in bundles of two, and are long (exceptionally up to ). Young trees up to 5–10 years old bear juvenile leaves, which are very different, single (not paired), long, glaucous blue-green; the adult leaves appear mixed with juvenile leaves from the fourth or fifth year on, replacing it fully by around the tenth year. Juvenile leaves are also produced in regrowth following injury, such as a broken shoot, on older trees.

The cones are broad, ovoid, long, and take 36 months to mature, longer than any other pine. The seeds (pine nuts, &quot;piñones&quot;, &quot;pinhões&quot;, &quot;pinoli&quot;, or &quot;pignons&quot;) are large, long, and pale brown with a powdery black coating that rubs off easily, and have a rudimentary wing that falls off very easily. The wing is ineffective for wind dispersal, and the seeds are animal-dispersed, originally mainly by the Iberian magpie, but in recent history largely by humans.

==Distribution and habitat==

The prehistoric range of &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; included North Africa in the Sahara Desert and Maghreb regions during a more humid climate period, in present-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Its contemporary natural range is in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome ecoregions and countries, including the following:

;Southern Europe:
The Iberian conifer forests ecoregion of the Iberian Peninsula in Spain and Portugal; the Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests ecoregion in France and Italy; the Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion of southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia; the Illyrian deciduous forests of the eastern coast of the Ionian and Adriatic Seas in Albania and Croatia; the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex ecoregion on Krasnodar Krai (Russia) and the Crimea Peninsula; and the Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion of the southern Balkan Peninsula in Greece. In many parts of northern Italy, large parks with pine trees were laid out by the sea. Examples are the Pineta of Jesolo and Barcola, the Urban Beach of Trieste.

In Greece, although the species is not widely distributed, an extensive stone pine forest exists in western Peloponnese at Strofylia on the peninsula separating the Kalogria Lagoon from the Mediterranean Sea. This coastal forest is at least long, with dense and tall stands of &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; mixed with &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;. Currently, &quot;P. halepensis&quot; is outcompeting stone pines in many locations of the forest. Another location in Greece is at Koukounaries on the northern Aegean island of Skiathos at the southwest corner of the island. This is a half-mile-long dense stand of stone and Aleppo pines that lies between a lagoon and the Aegean Sea.

;Western Asia:
In Western Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests ecoregion in Turkey; and the Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests ecoregion in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and in the Palestinian Territories.
;Northern Africa
The Mediterranean woodlands and forests ecoregion of North Africa, in Morocco and Algeria.
;South Africa
In the Western Cape Province, the pines were according to legend planted by the French Huguenot refugees who settled at the Cape of Good Hope during the late 17th century and who brought the seeds with them from France. The tree is known in the Afrikaans language as &quot;kroonden&quot;.

==Pests==
The introduced Western conifer seed bug (&quot;Leptoglossus occidentalis&quot;) was accidentally imported with timber to northern Italy in the late 1990s from the western US, and has spread across Europe as an invasive pest species since then. It feeds on the sap of developing conifer cones throughout its life, and its sap-sucking causes the developing seeds to wither and misdevelop. It has destroyed most of the pine nut seeds in Italy, threatening &quot;P. pinea&quot; in its native habitats there.

&quot;Pestalotiopsis pini&quot; (a genus of ascomycete fungi), was found as an emerging pathogen on &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; in Portugal. Evidence of shoot blight and stem necrosis were found in stone pine orchards and urban areas in 2020. The edible pine nut production has been decreasing in the affected area due to several factors, including pests and diseases. The fungus was found on needles, shoots and trunks of &quot;P. pinea&quot; and also on &quot;P. pinaster&quot;. &quot;Pestalotiopsis&quot; fungal species could represent a threat to the health of pine forests in the Mediterranean basin.

==Uses==

===Food===
&quot;Pinus pinea&quot; has been cultivated extensively for at least 6,000 years for its edible pine nuts, which have been trade items since early historic times. The tree has been cultivated throughout the Mediterranean region for so long that it has naturalized, and is often considered native beyond its natural range.

===Ornamental===
The tree is among the current symbols of Rome. It was first planted in Rome during the Roman Republic, where many historic Roman roads, such as the Via Appia, were (and still are) embellished with lines of stone pines. Stone pines were planted on the hills of the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul for ornamental purposes during the Ottoman period. In Italy, the stone pine has been an aesthetic landscape element since the Italian Renaissance garden period. In the 1700s, &quot;P. pinea&quot; began being introduced as an ornamental tree to other Mediterranean climate regions of the world, and is now often found in gardens and parks in South Africa, California, and Australia. It has naturalized beyond cities in South Africa to the extent that it is listed as an invasive species there. It is also planted in western Europe up to southern Scotland, and on the East Coast of the United States up to New Jersey.

In the United Kingdom it has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Small specimens are used for bonsai, and also grown in large pots and planters. The year-old seedlings are seasonally available as table-top Christmas trees tall.

===Other===
Other products of economic value include resin, bark for tannin extraction, and empty pine cone shells for fuel. &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; is also currently widely cultivated around the Mediterranean for environmental protection such as consolidation of coastal dunes, soil conservation and protection of coastal agricultural crops.

<doc id="547983" wikidata="Q5933760" url="?curid=547983" title="Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The award is available for editors of magazines, novels, anthologies, or other works related to science fiction or fantasy. The award supplanted a previous award for professionally edited magazines. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The award was first presented in 1973, and was given annually through 2006. Beginning in 2007, the award was split into two categories, that of Best Editor (Short Form) and Best Editor (Long Form). The Short Form award is for editors of anthologies, collections or magazines, while the Long Form award is for editors of novels. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, and in each case an award for professional editor was given.

During the 60 nomination years, 92 editors have been nominated for the original Best Professional Editor, the Short Form, or the Long Form award, including Retro Hugos. Of these, Gardner Dozois has received the most awards, with 15 original awards out of 19 nominations for the original category and 1 out of 2 for the Short Form. The only other editors to win more than three awards are Ellen Datlow, who won 9 of 18 nominations, split between the original and short form awards, Ben Bova, who won 6 of 8 nominations for the original award, and John W. Campbell Jr. with 8 out of 8 nominations for the Retro Hugo awards. The three editors who have won three times are Edward L. Ferman with 3 out of 20 original nominations, Neil Clarke with 3 out of 12 Short Form nominations, and Patrick Nielsen Hayden with 3 out of 4 Long Form nominations. Stanley Schmidt has received the most nominations, at 27 original and 7 Short Form, winning one Short Form.

==Selection==
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and are held in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote &quot;no award&quot;, if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that &quot;no award&quot; takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in both the Short Form and Long Form categories in 2015.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Editors are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year, and each date links to the &quot;year in literature&quot; article corresponding with when those works were eligible. Although the Best Professional Editor award is not given explicitly for any particular editing effort and such works are not recorded by the World Science Fiction Society, works that the editor in question was involved with in the eligibility period are listed. This list includes magazines or anthologies that the editor worked on and publishing houses that he or she was employed at, and is not intended to be comprehensive. Entries with a yellow background and an asterisk (*) next to the editor&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a gray background are the nominees on the short-list.

  +   No winner selected

=== Long Form ===
Starting with the 2007 awards, the Professional Editor award was split into two categories: Best Editor (Long Form) and Best Editor (Short Form). The Long Form award is for &quot;the editor of at least four novel-length works primarily devoted to science fiction and/or fantasy published in the previous calendar year&quot; in the official Hugo Award rules.

=== Short Form ===
The Best Editor Short Form award, also started in 2007, is given to &quot;the editor of at least four anthologies, collections or magazine issues primarily devoted to science fiction and/or fantasy, at least one of which was published in the previous calendar year.&quot;

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year (if no awards were originally given that year). Retro Hugos have been awarded seven times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954. In 1946, 1951, and 1954, the award was given for Best Professional Editor, as the category had not been split, while for the others it was given for Short Form only as Long Form did not have enough responses to make a ballot.

<doc id="547984" wikidata="Q407727" url="?curid=547984" title="Lyase">
<text>In biochemistry, a lyase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breaking (an elimination reaction) of various chemical bonds by means other than hydrolysis (a substitution reaction) and oxidation, often forming a new double bond or a new ring structure. The reverse reaction is also possible (called a Michael reaction). For example, an enzyme that catalyzed this reaction would be a lyase:

:ATP → cAMP + PPi

Lyases differ from other enzymes in that they require only one substrate for the reaction in one direction, but two substrates for the reverse reaction.

==Nomenclature==
Systematic names are formed as &quot;&quot;substrate group-lyase&quot;.&quot; Common names include decarboxylase, dehydratase, aldolase, etc. When the product is more important, synthase may be used in the name, e.g. phosphosulfolactate synthase (EC 4.4.1.19, Michael addition of sulfite to phosphoenolpyruvate).
A combination of both an elimination and a Michael addition is seen in O-succinylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase (MetY or MetZ) which catalyses first the γ-elimination of O-succinylhomoserine (with succinate as a leaving group) and then the addition of sulfide to the vinyl intermediate, this reaction was first classified as a lyase (EC 4.2.99.9), but was then reclassified as a transferase (EC 2.5.1.48).

== Classification ==
Lyases are classified as EC 4 in the EC number classification of enzymes. Lyases can be further classified into seven subclasses:
*EC 4.1 includes lyases that cleave carbon–carbon bonds, such as decarboxylases (EC 4.1.1), aldehyde lyases (EC 4.1.2), oxo acid lyases (EC 4.1.3), and others (EC 4.1.99) 
*EC 4.2 includes lyases that cleave carbon–oxygen bonds, such as dehydratases
*EC 4.3 includes lyases that cleave carbon–nitrogen bonds
*EC 4.4 includes lyases that cleave carbon–sulfur bonds
*EC 4.5 includes lyases that cleave carbon–halide bonds
*EC 4.6 includes lyases that cleave phosphorus–oxygen bonds, such as adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase
*EC 4.99 includes other lyases, such as ferrochelatase

==Membrane-associated lyases==
Some lyases associate with biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or anchored through a single transmembrane helix.
