<text>Robert Arthur Mould (born October 16, 1960) is an American musician, principally known for his work as guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter for alternative rock bands Hüsker Dü in the 1980s and Sugar in the 1990s.

==Early years==
Born in Malone, New York, Mould lived in several places, including the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where he attended Macalester College in Saint Paul. At Macalester, he formed Hüsker Dü in the late 1970s with drummer/singer Grant Hart and bass guitarist Greg Norton. Mould and Hart were the principal songwriters for Hüsker Dü.

==Musical career==
===Hüsker Dü===

Forming in 1979, Hüsker Dü first gained notice as a punk rock group with a series of recordings on the independent label SST Records. In 1986, they signed with a major record label (Warner Bros. Records), but found only modest commercial success. However, they were later often cited as one of the key influences on 1990s alternative rock, including bands such as Foo Fighters and Pixies.

In the late 1980s, Hüsker Dü broke up acrimoniously amid members&#x27; drug abuse, personal problems, disputes over songwriting credits, musical direction, and the suicide of the band&#x27;s manager, David Savoy. Mould and Hart played together only once after the breakup for two songs at a 2004 benefit concert for an ailing friend, the late Karl Mueller of Soul Asylum.

===First solo period (1988–1991)===

Just before Hüsker Dü broke up, Mould moved to a remote farmhouse in Pine City, Minnesota, having quit drinking and drugs, and wrote the songs that would make up his first solo album. Released by the newly formed Virgin Records America label, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Workbook&quot; eschewed Mould&#x27;s trademark wall-of-noise guitar for a lighter tone. Drummer Anton Fier (of The Feelies and later The Golden Palominos) and bassist Tony Maimone (of Pere Ubu) served as Mould&#x27;s rhythm section. The album peaked at number 127 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and the single &quot;See a Little Light&quot; reached number 4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

1990&#x27;s &quot;Black Sheets of Rain&quot; had a much heavier guitar sound, recalling Hüsker Dü&#x27;s louder, angrier moments. According to the liner notes for the 2012 re-release of Sugar&#x27;s &quot;Copper Blue&quot;, Creation Records president Alan McGee verified that total album sales were 7,000 copies. Still, the album peaked at number 123 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and the single &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; reached number 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Mould also co-founded a record label, Singles Only Label, with Coyote Records label founder Steve Fallon. The label released singles from bands such as Daniel Johnston, Grant Lee Buffalo, Moby, Mojo Nixon, Morphine, Nikki Sudden, and R. Stevie Moore from 1989 to 1994.

===Sugar (1992–1995)===

Mould then formed the group Sugar, with bassist David Barbe and drummer Malcolm Travis. Along with extensive touring, Sugar released two albums, an EP and a B-sides collection before breaking up in early 1995. 1992&#x27;s &quot;Copper Blue&quot; was named as NME&#x27;s 1992 Album of the Year, and was Mould&#x27;s most successful commercial album, selling nearly 300,000 copies.

While in the band Sugar, in 1993 he contributed the track &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight It&quot; as a solo artist to the AIDS Benefit Album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1994, he recorded &quot;Turning of the Tide&quot; for &quot;Beat The Retreat&quot;, a tribute album to the English guitarist and songwriter Richard Thompson.

===Second solo period (1996–present)===
In 1996, Mould returned to solo recording, releasing a self-titled album in 1996 on Rykodisc, often referred to as &quot;Hubcap&quot; because of the cover photo. Mould played all of the instruments himself, and programmed the drums instead of using a real drummer. The album peaked at number 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and number 1 on the Heatseekers chart.

In 1998, Mould released &quot;The Last Dog and Pony Show&quot;, his final album on Rykodisc (who had released all of the Sugar albums in the U.S.). The album was named as such because Mould decided that the tour that followed would be his &quot;last electric band tour.&quot;

After the tour, Mould took a break from the music world to get involved with another passion of his, professional wrestling, when he joined WCW as a scriptwriter in 1999 for a brief period. Creative differences with some of the other writers led to Mould&#x27;s leaving the company and returning to music. The liner notes for the 2002 album &quot;Modulate&quot; thank some of the wrestlers he associated with, most notably Kevin Nash and Kevin Sullivan.

During a stint living in New York City in the late-1990s, as he more fully embraced his identity as a gay man, Mould&#x27;s tastes took a detour into dance music and electronica. Those influences were clear on his 2002 release &quot;Modulate&quot;, which featured a strong electronica influence to mixed critical reviews and poor fan reaction. One song, &quot;The Receipt,&quot; was fairly straightforward, according to &quot;City Pages&quot;: it &quot;can be taken as a barely veiled attack on Mould&#x27;s old Husker Dü-mate Grant Hart.&quot; (In fact, another song on the album [&quot;Trade&quot;] had been written and performed live during his Hüsker Dü days.) In further pursuit of this sound, Mould also began recording under the pseudonym LoudBomb (an anagram of his name), releasing one CD (&quot;Long Playing Grooves&quot;) so far under this name.
His next solo album, &quot;Body of Song&quot;, had been originally scheduled to closely follow the release of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Modulate&quot;. Instead, Mould worked on the album for the next three years, resulting in a 2005 release. By this time, he had changed his mind on touring with a band, and announced his first band tour since 1998. The tour lineup included bassist Jason Narducy (of Verbow), drummer Brendan Canty (of Fugazi), and Mould&#x27;s Blowoff collaborator, Morel, on keyboards.

In addition to his solo work, Mould also worked as a live DJ in collaboration with Washington DC-area dance music artist Richard Morel, under the collective banner Blowoff. They frequently staged at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. A Blowoff CD was released in September 2006, consisting of songs recorded together by the two. Mould has also done remixes for a variety of dance and alternative rock artists, including a remix of the Interpol song &quot;Length of Love.&quot;

&quot;District Line&quot; was released February 5, 2008. A little over a year later, on April 7, 2009, Mould released his next album entitled &quot;Life and Times&quot; in the midst of researching his life for an autobiography.

Mould ultimately wrote that memoir with Michael Azerrad, the author of &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; and &quot;Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana.&quot; The book, &quot;See a Little Light: The Trail of Rage and Melody&quot;, was published in June 2011.

On August 6, 2012, Mould released the first single from his first album on Merge Records, &quot;Silver Age&quot;, on September 4, 2012. It peaked at No. 52 on the Billboard 200 album chart, No. 12 on the Alternative Albums chart, and No. 3 on the Tastemaker Albums chart. In 2014 Mould released &quot;Beauty &amp; Ruin&quot; and in March 2016, his album &quot;Patch the Sky&quot; was released.

On October 25, 2018, Mould shared a new song, &quot;Sunshine Rock&quot; from his new album of the same name, arriving February 8, 2019, via Merge Records

On June 3, 2020, Mould released a new song &quot;American Crisis&quot; the lead single from his album &quot;Blue Hearts&quot;, released on September 25.

On January 8, 2025, he announced a new album &quot;Here We Go Crazy&quot; coming out on March 7, and released the title track as its first single. He will be touring throughout the United States in support of the album.

=== Instruments ===
As a member of Hüsker Dü, Mould was known for playing Flying V–style guitars, mainly an Ibanez Rocket Roll Jr.

In 1988, Mould bought a blue Fender American Standard Stratocaster off the rack after playing it &quot;for about 15 seconds, unplugged.&quot; The Stratocaster has been his electric guitar of choice since the breakup of Hüsker Dü around that time. His favored acoustic guitar is a 12-string Yamaha APX.

==Collaborations==
Mould has made various guest appearances throughout his career. In 1984, Mould played piano on Ground Zero&#x27;s album &quot;Ground Zero.&quot; In 1991, Mould sang and played guitar on the Golden Palominos album &quot;Drunk with Passion&quot; on the song &quot;Dying from the Inside Out.&quot; In 1992, he contributed vocals to the song, &quot;Dio&quot; on the Throwing Muses album &quot;Red Heaven.&quot; Mould performed the guitars for the soundtrack for the film version of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, released in 1999. In 2000, Mould sang &quot;He Didn&#x27;t&quot; (written by Stephin Merritt) on The 6ths&#x27; album &quot;Hyacinths and Thistles&quot;. He also contributed vocals to the 2009 Fucked Up cover of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;

In 2011, Mould performed on the Foo Fighters album &quot;Wasting Light&quot;, contributing guitar and vocals to the track &quot;Dear Rosemary.&quot; He made sporadic appearances with the band during their Wasting Light tour to perform the song on stage, including on the Conan O&#x27;Brien show. In December 2017, Mould opened for the Foo Fighters in four states during their &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot; tour.

==Personal life==
Though Mould&#x27;s sexual orientation had previously been an open secret, he was outed in the early 1990s in an interview in the music magazine &quot;Spin&quot;. Since then, Mould has been cited as a musical and social influence among other openly gay musicians. &quot;Hüsker Dü changed my life. That was a huge influence on me,&quot; said Steve Brooks of Torche. &quot;Before Rob Halford came out, there was Bob Mould. He wasn&#x27;t very vocal about it, but I&#x27;m a big fan of his music. It was comforting — one of my favorite musicians was &#x27;a gay!&#x27; Kick ass.&quot; Mould self-identifies as a gay bear and appeared in the 2010 documentary &quot;Bear Nation&quot;.

In April 2004, Mould was a co-organizer of the WEDRock benefit concert for Freedom to Marry. &quot;WedRock&quot; was a play on the word &quot;wedlock&quot;. The event raised an estimated US$30,000. Mould also contributed the song &quot;See a Little Light&quot; to the 2006 album &quot;Wed-Rock: A Benefit for Freedom to Marry,&quot; an album to support in the legalization of same-sex marriage.

In interviews to promote his 2019 album &quot;Sunshine Rock&quot;, Mould revealed that he had been residing in Berlin, Germany, since 2015. he splits his time between San Francisco and Palm Springs, California.
 In San Francisco, he specifically lives in the Castro District, famously known as San Francisco&#x27;s gay neighborhood.

Bob is married to Don Fisher. 

==In popular culture==
Mould&#x27;s song &quot;Dog on Fire&quot; is the theme song for &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. He originally wrote the track for his third solo album, but cut it as redundant. The name was picked by mastering engineer Jim Wilson from an offhand comment Mould made in an interview. They Might Be Giants performed updated versions which were used in the 2000s, and the song was later remixed by Timbaland when Trevor Noah took over as host. On December 19, 1996, Mould made a cameo appearance on &quot;The Daily Show Holiday Spectacular&quot; in an homage duet of &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; with Mould playing the part of David Bowie to Craig Kilborn&#x27;s &quot;Bing Crosby&quot;.

The song &quot;See a Little Light&quot; has been used more than once in various television applications: It was used in the closing scene of the original un-aired test pilot episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, it was also used in the closing scene of the season 1 finale for &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;, it became one of the principal theme songs for the HBO series &quot;The Mind of the Married Man&quot; and was also used in a television commercial for TIAA-CREF (August 2007). Mould also composed the theme for the TLC program, &quot;In a Fix&quot;.

In 2011, Mould wrote his autobiography &quot;See a Little Light&quot; with Michael Azerrad.

In 2001, Mould played lead guitar in the house band for the film of John Cameron Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical), &quot; and on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. In 2003, Mould also participated in a Hedwig tribute album, &quot;Wig in a Box&quot;, on which he covered the song &quot;Nailed.&quot;

On September 29, 2005, Mould&#x27;s song &quot;Circles&quot; was included on &quot;The OC&quot;.

Mould appeared on an episode of Independent Film Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Henry Rollins Show&quot; on June 15, 2007.

On November 21, 2011, musicians such as Dave Grohl, Britt Daniel and Jessica Dobson of Spoon, Craig Finn and Tad Kubler of The Hold Steady, Randy Randall and Dean Allen Spunt of No Age, Margaret Cho, Jason Narducy, Jon Wurster of Superchunk, and Ryan Adams came together at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and played songs from Bob Mould&#x27;s career. During the concert, Bob discussed his then-forthcoming album &quot;Silver Age&quot;, involving Jason Narducy and drummer Jon Wurster (of Superchunk), and a limited tour of Sugar&#x27;s debut album &quot;Copper Blue&quot;.

Mould has been honored with two stars on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, one for his solo work and one for Hüsker Dü. The stars recognize performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<doc id="553806" wikidata="Q5937590" url="?curid=553806" title="Human Target">
<text>The Human Target is the name of two fictional characters in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first is Fred Venable, while the second is private investigator and bodyguard Christopher Chance who assumes the identities of clients targeted by assassins and other dangerous criminals. Chance has appeared in numerous books published throughout the decades and has appeared in television adaptations.

Chance has appeared in two self-titled TV series in 1992 and 2010, portrayed by Rick Springfield and Mark Valley respectively, and made guest appearances in the Arrowverse TV series &quot;Arrow&quot;, portrayed by Wil Traval.

==Publication history==
The first character to use the &quot;Human Target&quot; title (Fred Venable) appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #201 (November 1953), and was created by Edmond Hamilton and Sheldon Moldoff.

The second character to use the &quot;Human Target&quot; title (Christopher Chance) first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #419 (December 1972) and was created by Len Wein and Carmine Infantino. Later, the feature appeared in Batman titles such as &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. He starred in a limited series, a one-shot, and then an ongoing series written by Peter Milligan and published under DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. In 2021, Tom King and Greg Smallwood began a 12-issue limited series for DC&#x27;s Black Label imprint.

===Comic listing===
==Vertigo==

Writer Peter Milligan and Edvin Biukovic revived Christopher Chance in 1999, moving the character to DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint for a four-issue limited series. The mini-series was followed by the graphic novel &quot;Human Target: Final Cut&quot;, as well as a series lasting 21 issues until its cancellation in 2005.

==Reception==
The Human Target story &quot;The Unshredded Man&quot; was analyzed as an example of depictions of the September 11 attacks in American popular culture.

==In other media==

This version is a Vietnam War veteran in addition to being a private investigator and bodyguard who charges ten percent of a client&#x27;s annual income to take their place. Additionally, he is assisted by eccentric computer genius Philo Marsden, who designs high-tech masks for Chance to use in conjunction with sophisticated makeup; Jeff Carlyle, the chauffeur, cook, and pilot for Chance&#x27;s mobile base of operations, the Blackwing; and Lilly Page, an ex-CIA agent who helps coordinate Chance&#x27;s missions.
** Chance appears in the tie-in one-shot &quot;The Human Target Special&quot; #1.

<text>The Canberra District wine region is located around Canberra in the Capital city of Australia. It covers the northern part of the Australian Capital Territory and an area of New South Wales to the east and north of that, including towns of Bungendore, Murrumbateman and Yass, New South Wales.

Wine is grown and produced in a triangular area of about 60 km sides bordered by Canberra, Yass, and Bungendore, taking in the important localities of Murrumbateman and Lake George. The district is noted as a cool-climate wine area, but encompasses a substantial climatic range, with the lower altitude and more inland regions near Yass substantially warmer than the higher altitude areas near Bungendore.

==History==
The industry dates from the 1970s, although wines were produced in the settlement near Yass in the 1860s.

==Climate and geography==
The region is part of the Southern Tablelands about inland from the Pacific Ocean. The region receives moderate, but variable rainfall, and vineyards require supplemental irrigation in most years. Typical vineyard elevations range between , and the inland location result in relatively high continentality, possibly explaining the affinity for leading varieties Shiraz and Riesling. Promising recent results from Tempranillo may be explained by the strong homoclime to Ribera del Duero.
*Annual rainfall: 
*Mean January (late growth period) temp: 
*Sunshine hours per day: 7.4 

==Production==
The main grape varieties grown are Riesling, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon, Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Viognier, Tempranillo, Pinot noir and Pinot gris. Picking and vintage extend from late February (Pinot noir, Chardonnay) to late May (botrytis Pinot gris or Riesling).

About two thirds of the vines are red wine varieties, and one third are white.

<doc id="553810" wikidata="Q1760399" url="?curid=553810" title="Sugar (American band)">
<text>Sugar was an American alternative rock band active in the early 1990s. Formed in 1992, they were led by the singer and guitarist Bob Mould (ex-Hüsker Dü), alongside bassist David Barbe (ex-Mercyland) and drummer Malcolm Travis (ex-Human Sexual Response).

==Career==
After frontman Bob Mould departed from Hüsker Dü, he released two solo ventures, &quot;Workbook&quot; and &quot;Black Sheets of Rain&quot;; neither album was well received and Mould was released from his contract with Virgin Records America in 1991 as a result. Shortly after, Mould recorded a demo tape of over thirty songs and formed Sugar with David Barbe and Malcolm Travis. The band was named in a Waffle House restaurant in Athens, Georgia, when Mould spotted a sugar packet on the table where he and the other two band members were sitting. Their first concert was on February 20, 1992, at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia, after a few weeks warming up in R.E.M.&#x27;s downtown practice space.

Later in 1992, the band released the album &quot;Copper Blue&quot; on Rykodisc in the US and Creation Records in the UK. &quot;Copper Blue&quot; was named Album Of The Year 1992 by &quot;NME&quot;. The music videos for the singles &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Change Your Mind&quot; and &quot;Helpless&quot; received extensive air time on MTV shortly after the album&#x27;s release. The single for &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Change Your Mind&quot; had moderate success in the UK Singles Chart.

In the spring of 1993, they released &quot;Beaster&quot;, an EP of material recorded during the &quot;Copper Blue&quot; sessions. The album proved to be more aggressive than the content on &quot;Copper Blue&quot;. After an abortive attempt to record a second album, the band regrouped and released &quot;File Under: Easy Listening&quot; in September 1994. It reached No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart.

A b-side compilation album, &quot;Besides&quot;, followed in July 1995. The band played their final show in Japan in 1995, Mould broke the band up in spring 1996. Barbe wished to spend more time with his growing family and expand his solo career. Travis took over the drumming slot in Kustomized.

Bob Mould spent the summer of 2012 touring and playing &quot;Copper Blue&quot; in its entirety.

<doc id="553821" wikidata="Q11082378" url="?curid=553821" title="Jonah Hex">
<text>Jonah Woodson Hex is a fictional antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer John Albano and artist Tony DeZuniga. Hex is a surly and cynical bounty hunter whose face is scarred on the right side. Despite his poor reputation and personality, Hex is bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent.

Hex has been substantially adapted in other media, including animated television series and films. Bill McKinney, Adam Baldwin, Phil Morris, and Thomas Jane, among others, have voiced the character in animation. Furthermore, Josh Brolin and Johnathon Schaech portray Hex in a self-titled film and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; respectively.

==Publication history==
===Debut===
The character first appeared in a full-page in-house ad for &quot;All-Star Western&quot; #10 which was published in various November/December 1971-dated DC comics, including a few of DC&#x27;s war comics line, as well as a half-page version of the same house ad in &quot;Batman&quot; #237. This house ad contains the first published images of Jonah Hex, as well as two dialogue-filled comic strip panels not used in his first full-story appearance.

His first full-story appearance was published a few weeks later in volume two of &quot;All-Star Western&quot; #10 (February–March 1972), which was renamed &quot;Weird Western Tales&quot; with its twelfth issue. Jonah Hex headlined the new title right up until issue #38, at which point Scalphunter took over the spotlight while Jonah Hex moved into his own self-titled series in 1977. The series lasted for 92 issues with Michael Fleisher as the main writer and Tony DeZuniga providing much of the art.

In a 2010 interview with Filipino journalist Anna Valmero, DeZuniga described the moment he first conceived the image that would become Jonah Hex: When I went to my doctor, I saw this beautiful chart of the human anatomy. And I saw the anatomy of the figure was split in half, straight from head to toe. Half his skeleton was there, half his nerves and muscles. That&#x27;s where I got the idea it won&#x27;t be too bad if his distortion would be half.

===&quot;Hex&quot;===
&quot;Jonah Hex&quot; was canceled during the publication of the mini-series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;—in which Jonah appeared, along with Scalphunter and other western heroes, in issue #3—but in the same year Jonah moved to a new eighteen-issue series titled &quot;Hex&quot;, also penned by Michael Fleisher. In a bizarre turn of events, Hex found that he had been transported to the 21st century and became somewhat of a post-apocalyptic warrior, reminiscent of Mad Max. The series had mediocre success in the United States but was critically acclaimed and well received in Great Britain, Italy, Spain and Japan.

===Limited series===
Three &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; miniseries have been published under DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. These series, written by Joe R. Lansdale and drawn by Tim Truman, fit more into the western-horror genre, as Hex interacts with zombies (&quot;Two-Gun Mojo&quot; #1–5, 1993), a Cthulhoid monster (&quot;Riders of the Worm and Such&quot; #1–5, 1995) and spirit people (&quot;Shadows West&quot; #1–3, 1999).

===&quot;Jonah Hex&quot; vol. 2===
A new monthly &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; series debuted in November 2005 (cover date January 2006), written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti with interior art by varying (and occasionally recurring) artists. In assorted postings on their message board, Gray and Palmiotti have stated their intent was to depict various adventures from across the full length of Hex&#x27;s life and career. The main artistic difference is that the series is published without the external restraints of the Comics Code Authority which allows for harder-edged stories without having to keep with the Vertigo imprint&#x27;s dark fantasy themes. Tony DeZuniga, the original Hex artist, returned to pencil two issues of the book (#5 and #9). John Higgins drew issue #28 and J. H. Williams III provided the art for &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; #35, expressing an interest in doing more: &quot;I certainly want to do more issues myself or even a graphic novel if the opportunity and schedule presented itself.&quot;

To coincide with the release of the film Gray and Palmiotti wrote an original graphic novel, &quot;No Way Back&quot;, illustrated by Tony DeZuniga.

===&quot;All-Star Western&quot; vol. 3===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. With this change, &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; volume 2 was canceled and Jonah transitioned as the lead story in &quot;All-Star Western&quot; volume 3 (November 2011). While &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; vol. 2 consisted of standalone stories, &quot;All-Star Western&quot; features an ongoing story arc that finds Jonah in Gotham City during the 1880s, teamed up with Amadeus Arkham.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Born on November 1, 1838, in northwestern Missouri to Woodson and Virginia Hex, Jonah was a regular victim of physical abuse inflicted by his father, an alcoholic. In 1851, Woodson sold his son as a slave to a local Apache tribe. They worked him constantly until he saved their chieftain from a puma; in gratitude, the chief took Jonah as his adopted son, but this angered his own son, Noh-Tante. Noh-Tante shared Jonah&#x27;s affections for a young girl named White Fawn, so he betrayed his adopted brother during their manhood rite at the age of 16 and left Jonah to die at the hands of a party of Kiowa Indians. A patrol of American cavalrymen came to his aid, but when they saw him trying to help the Kiowa, the soldiers shot him as well. Jonah survived only when an old trapper scavenging the site found him clinging to life and nursed him back to health. Returning to his tribe&#x27;s camp, he found that they had already left, leaving him without a family once again.

===American Civil War===
Jonah eventually returned to American civilization, becoming a cavalry scout in the United States Army. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Jonah, feeling that the South was justified in seeking independence, joined the Confederate States Army and earned a commission as a lieutenant in the 4th Cavalry. It was during this time that he made his first friend, a fellow-soldier named Jeb Turnbull.

As time went on, Hex found himself increasingly torn – he had become close with many of his fellow-Confederates, but having once been a slave himself, he was unwilling to fight for the preservation of slavery. In September 1862, after learning about the Emancipation Proclamation, Jonah made up his mind and decided to surrender. He deserted his post and went to the nearest Union camp, Fort Charlotte, sneaking into the commander&#x27;s quarters to surrender directly. He refused to tell the commander where his unit was stationed, but one of his aides was able to determine their location by studying the clay from the shoes of Jonah&#x27;s horse. The Confederates were caught by surprise, and all of them were captured. The commander, humiliated by Jonah easily penetrating the fort&#x27;s poor security, falsely praised him for his &quot;assistance&quot; in the attack. Hex punched him and was sentenced to solitary confinement.

Jonah discovered a shaft beneath his cell and used it to find where his comrades were being held. With Jeb&#x27;s help, he rallied them and worked out a plan to use the shaft to sneak all of them out. What Hex did not realize was that the &quot;escape tunnel&quot; was a trap. The commander had run out of food to feed his captives, and had ordered the shaft to be dug in secret knowing that the prisoners would use it to try and escape. In an event that came to be known as the &quot;Fort Charlotte Massacre&quot;, Union soldiers ambushed and gunned down nearly all of the fleeing Confederates, including Jeb. Jonah was shot himself, but managed to kill the treacherous commander before escaping. A handful of survivors, believing that Hex had betrayed them, returned home and told everyone they could find that Jonah Hex was a murderer and a traitor. Now hunted by both sides, Jonah patched himself up and moved out toward the Western territories to start over.

===Mark of the Demon===
Jonah came across his old tribe and found that Noh-Tante had since married White Fawn. He revealed Noh-Tante&#x27;s betrayal to the chieftain, but the accusations were denied and it was decided that they would settle their dispute through combat. Noh-Tante sabotaged Jonah&#x27;s tomahawk so it would break, forcing Jonah to stab him with a knife. Enraged that Jonah had killed his son and broken the rules of combat, the chieftain had him restrained and disfigured with the &quot;mark of the demon&quot; by scarring the right side of his face with a heated tomahawk. With the mark serving as proof of his wickedness, Jonah was banished from the tribe. Years later, when he and his partner Henri d&#x27;Aubergnon sought to rescue a white woman held captive by the tribe, Jonah saw the man he once considered his real father shoot White Fawn for trying to protect him. Without hesitation, he gunned down the elderly chieftain and slaughtered most of the Apaches.

===Bounty-hunter===
Hex soon took up drinking to deal with the pain of his tribe&#x27;s betrayal. One day, he stumbled out of a saloon to see a man beating his wife. Believing that the man was his father, Woodson Hex, Jonah shot him. A lawman informed him that the man was, in fact, Lucas &quot;Mad Dog&quot; McGill, an outlaw with a massive bounty on his head that no one had dared try to collect. Acknowledging that Hex had drawn his gun faster than any man he&#x27;d ever seen, the deputy gave him the bounty. Intrigued by the idea that he could get paid for killing bad men, Hex scattered his reward on the streets as he rode out of town. He then picked up his first job: hunting down an old army buddy named Eddie Cantwell. The job quickly when Hex was intercepted by Arbee Stoneham, a veteran manhunter who killed Cantwell, disarmed Hex, and stole his guns. Eight years later, they met again after Hex brought in the Jason Crowley gang and collected their bounties. He then found Stoneham, confined to a wheelchair after losing the use of his legs. Although he was tempted to take revenge, Hex instead shared a drink with Stoneham and left him in peace.

Hex was then hired by the town of Paradise Corners to kill the outlaw &quot;Big&quot; Jim. Hex grew fond of the town and decided to settle there, but the locals, disgusted by his appearance, forced him to leave. He rescued a man named Terry White from starvation in the desert and saved his life, but when White stole from him and fled, Hex hunted him down and killed him.

===&quot;Weird Western Tales&quot;===
Jonah befriended a wolf named Iron Jaws when he failed to stop white settlers from slaughtering the peaceful band of Pawnee Indians who had owned him. Gunfighter Windy Taylor, who had taught Hex everything he knew about shooting, asked him to help find his son, Tod Taylor, who had turned outlaw. Tod gunned down his father and Hex was forced to kill him. Iron Jaws died after venturing into the desert to rescue Hex after two criminals tied him up and left him to die of exposure. Hex dealt with a corrupt sheriff defrauding his constituents in one town, and then a corrupt hanging judge at the next. He was hired by the manager of a sideshow attraction to act as his bodyguard, then murdered the man when he tried to frame him for a heinous crime. Finding an escaped psychopath on the run, he killed the man after learning that he was a famous murderer known as the &quot;Gentleman Killer&quot;. Fort Lang was seemingly attacked by an Indian tribe, but Hex saved them after uncovering a conspiracy by railroad interests to force them off their land so it could be illegally seized. When some bandits Hex had been pursuing injured an old lady who had shown him kindness, he paid for her medical treatment before chasing down and butchering the men who had hurt her.

During a hunt for criminal Blackjack Jorgis, Hex was ambushed by ex-Confederates sent by Quentin Turnbull, father of his deceased friend Jeb. Hex escaped death, but his friend and mentor, Hank Brewster, was shot dead and his first horse, the General, was killed by stray bullets. Briefly hired by the U.S. Secret Service, he toppled an assassination conspiracy against Ulysses S. Grant. Temporarily blinded from his injuries, he managed to take down an entire gang without his sight. He fought corrupt army officials in league with a greedy landowner who was organizing robbers to prey on travelling pioneers, and avenged the victims they had left to die.

===Five Warriors from Forever===
The Lord of Time assembled a team, known as the Five Warriors from Forever, when he believed that his time-machine, the Eternity Brain, would end all existence. This team included Jonah Hex alongside Black Pirate, Enemy Ace, Miss Liberty, and the Viking Prince; to make them powerful enough to become a threat, they were each energized with a special force. Their purpose was to fight the Justice League and Justice Society to strengthen their resolve through defeat, which they succeeded in doing. Eventually, the Five Warriors rebelled against their master and assaulted the Palace of Eternity. Hex got into a gun-fight with a T-Rex, but he and his teammates were defeated and eventually returned to their own times using the Cosmic Treadmill.

He later encountered the Justice League separately, with several other Western heroes including Bat Lash, Cinnamon, and Scalphunter. The Lord of Time sent members of the League back to the 19th century as part of an absurd plot to rule the world. Jonah met an amnesiac Hal Jordan in the desert and nursed him back to health. The two teamed up with Elongated Man, Flash, and Zatanna to take down some robotic gunfighters while the League dealt with an anti-matter asteroid that threatened to destroy the Earth. In the present, Superman defeated the Time Lord and restored things to normal.

===Crisis on Infinite Earths===

Hex became involved in the first Crisis when he was summoned, along with several other heroes, to fight for the Monitor. Jonah Hex fought against the Shadow Demons alongside Bat Lash, Cyborg, Firebrand, John Stewart, Johnny Thunder, Nighthawk, Psimon, and Scalphunter. Alex Luthor and Harbinger gathered the heroes of several Earths to discuss strategy, and Hex was present in the crowd to witness Pariah&#x27;s warnings.

===Hex===
Jonah Hex disappeared in a flash of light one night at a saloon in 1875. He was abducted from his own era by the villainous Reinhold Borsten (and with a little unintentional help from Access), who transported him into a post-apocalyptic Seattle, Washington in the 21st century. His intention was to force the legendary Hex to fight for him, but instead Jonah escaped and met a motorcycle gang named the Road Reapers. They immediately took him in after he rescued their warrior Stiletta, and he obtained a zonesuit to protect himself from radiation by killing their cowardly leader, Falcon, in self-defense. His next companions were a group of time-travelers, a unit of soldiers from the Vietnam War; the group was betrayed by a robotic duplicate of Stiletta and none survived except for a Cpt. Stanley Harris. Hex took a job as a guard for a drug dealer named Barnaby Blossom. When he discovered that Barnaby was getting kids hooked, he killed the man. The real Stiletta tracked him down, and they became stranded in the desert together without water after a roadside ambush. They survived by walking twelve miles to an oasis and fighting off killer mutant worms. Having attracted negative attention from the underworld organization known as the Conglomerate by disrupting their drug operations, Hex and Stiletta were hunted down by a mercenary named Chain, who they defeated in a confrontation in a junkyard. The Conglomerate then changed tactics, enlisting Hex to help them take down Borsten, and he allowed himself to be captured by Borsten in a fight, planning to use his time-travel technology to return home. Stiletta and Harris broke into Borsten&#x27;s complex to help him and Harris was sent home, but the equipment was destroyed before Hex could use it. He and Stiletta escaped as the building exploded, and Borsten apparently died in the blast.

Resigned to his fate, Hex got his hands on more advanced guns after he won a competition at a dangerous live-shooting gallery, but Stiletta was abducted and seemingly killed while he was distracted. He was then captured by a scientist named Dr. Adamant who planned to convert Hex into a cyborg for his &quot;utopia&quot; of artificial life, but Hex escaped and wiped him out along with his creations. His next challenge was an anti-sin cult called the Sin Killers, whom he dealt with while rescuing the kidnapped daughter of a local man. Borsten was later revealed to have survived the explosion. Briefly, Jonah met the Legion of Super-Heroes while they were travelling in their Time Bubble.

New York City&#x27;s leading crime syndicate, the Combine, sent Hex after their greatest enemy, the Batman, by framing him for Stiletta&#x27;s murder; the two men fought and nearly killed each other. Realizing that they were on the same side, Hex helped Batman stop the Combine from unleashing their war machines on the innocents of the city. Stiletta was discovered to still be alive, having been brainwashed and trained as a professional wrestler, under the name &quot;Blonde Spitfire&quot;. Briefly, Jonah was captured by two cannibals and forced to escape through the sewers. He then began hunting down members of the Combine. The Road Reapers were captured by a group of warriors called the Dogs of War, who pressed them into slave labor for their master, an alien named S&#x27;ven Tarah. Jonah was forced to fight Stiletta, but he was able to free her from her wrestler persona after knocking her out.

Tarah revealed that he was also a time-traveller and that his slave camps were building a machine to thwart an alien invasion from the Xxggs. Hex was attacked by his old enemy Chain again in revenge for their last battle, but defeated him a second time. Having been made a slave by Tarah&#x27;s ally Manta, Hex organized his fellow-captives to escape and fought an enforcer named Starkad on his way out. Stanley Harris revealed that he was actually one of the Dogs of War, and enlisted Jonah&#x27;s service. They fought against the Xxggs for the future of humanity and succeeded, but Tarah admitted that he was unable to return Hex to 1875. Hex chose to spend Thanksgiving Day with Stiletta. They went to a long-abandoned amusement park, where Hex found his own stuffed corpse in a display. Realizing that the body was from his own time in the past, Hex found comfort knowing that someday he would get to go home.

===Two-Gun Mojo===
Jonah Hex met another bounty-hunter, Slow Go Smith, who became his friend and partner. Smith was killed by gun-toting zombies in a barn, and Hex was framed for his murder. Fleeing from the law, Hex investigated the origins of the zombies and learned that they were given life by snake oil merchant Doc &quot;Cross&quot; Williams. Williams, using his knowledge of voodoo from his travels in Haiti, had created an army of the dead to serve him, even reanimating the corpse of Wild Bill Hickok to be his personal bodyguard. Cross sought to do the same to Hex, but he escaped and confronted the Doc. Jonah put Hickok down again by beating him on the draw, then avenged his friend by leaving Williams to die a slow, brutal death at the hands of the Apaches whose dead he had desecrated.

===Riders of the Worm and Such===
After killing outlaw Stove Belly Jack and wiping out his gang, Hex met a giant worm in the desert. He teamed up with the inhabitants of a local ranch who&#x27;d been under attack by the creatures. It turned out that the monsters were actually sentient, the half-bred rape children of an underground race and a human woman, and that they called themselves the Autumn Brothers. Hex rallied the ranchers to take the offensive. He led them in an assault on the tunnel system where the rest of the worms lived, slaughtering them as they went and blowing up their queen with dynamite.

===Shadows West===
Jonah became a member of Buffalo Will&#x27;s travelling Wild West Show after a trick-shooting midget named Long Tom saved his life. He reconnected with an old friend named Spotted Balls and met a local prostitute who gave birth to a Bear Boy. She claimed to have given birth after mating with a bear spirit. Hex decided to leave the camp with Spotted Balls and the squaw because he did not like the way things were run and feared that Will would try to exploit the Bear Boy. This infuriated the showman, who sent an armed posse led by Long Tom after them. Jonah killed most of his pursuers using carefully set traps, but Spotted Balls died in the final shootout. He was able to return the squaw and her cub to its father and his spirit people. Returning to Will&#x27;s camp with Long Tom&#x27;s corpse, he swore to the corrupt promoter that if he ever saw him again he would kill him.

===Face Full of Violence===
When a rich family hired him to track down their kidnapped son, Hex found the boy had become part of an underground dog-fighting ring and was forced to put him down when he contracted rabies. In a conflict involving a stolen gold crucifix, he burned an entire mining town to the ground. Bat Lash, a travelling gambler and vigilante, helped him take revenge against a corrupt lawman who tried to frame him. The mayor of a small town tried to have Hex hanged as a rapist to hide the incestuous rape of his mute daughter, but the townspeople lynched the politician instead when they learned the truth. While escorting a bounty on Christmas Day, he got into a gunfight, killing a dozen men who wanted to murder his quarry. In the town of Salvation, he met a local gang who disguised themselves as nuns to hide from the law; Hex took them down when they tried to kill him.

===Death===
Jonah Hex continued to work as a bounty-hunter until he retired at the age of 66 in 1904, having settled down with a Native American woman named Tall Bird. By then he was a living legend, with others amazed to see the greatest gunman of the Old West still alive in an era of airplanes and automobiles. A journalist, Michael Wheeler, visited Hex to write his biography. The entertainer L.B. Farnham also showed up, offering Hex a great deal of money to star in his &quot;Wild West Revue&quot; show, but Hex angrily turned him down, not wanting to spend his final years as a carnival attraction. Hex&#x27;s last bounty was the gang of bank robber George Barrow; Barrow survived, and swore revenge. Playing cards in a Cheyenne saloon, Hex was murdered by Barrow with a double-barreled shotgun while fumbling to put on his spectacles. His death was immediately avenged by his friend, sheriff Hank Crawford, who gunned down the unarmed Barrow in cold blood. In his dying moments, Hex reflected on the life that he had lived.

Tall Bird and Wheeler attempted to give Jonah a proper Native American burial, but they were robbed at gunpoint by Farnham and an accomplice. Farnham had Wheeler shot and set fire to Tall Bird&#x27;s house, leaving her to die. Hex&#x27;s body was given to a taxidermist to be put in a gaudy outfit for display; Farnham and his associate were both killed by the &quot;accidental&quot; discharge (at point-blank range) of Jonah&#x27;s hair-trigger guns while setting up the display and thieves stole the body after recognizing Hex. For years, the corpse changed hands and was moved by various owners, before finally ending up as a dummy at a Western-style theme park. Tall Bird was then revealed to have survived the fire; now an old woman, she protected her husband&#x27;s body from further violation by claiming it for burial. While speaking with a young historian to fill in the missing details of Hex&#x27;s life, a corrupt Western memorabilia collector threatened them, hoping to take the body for himself. The evil collector suddenly died after being shot from behind, and it is implied that Hex&#x27;s vengeful spirit returned to protect his wife from beyond the grave.

===Post mortem===
Many years later, a supermodel and actress who happened to have the surname Hex seemed to become possessed when her right eye was cut out by members of a group called the Agenda. She assisted Superboy and displayed psionic powers when she repeatedly fired an unloaded energy weapon, but this change in consciousness seems to have been temporary. Eventually, she decided to become a bounty-huntress like her predecessor, using Grokk the Living Gargoyle as a steed.

Jonah Hex was reanimated during &quot;Blackest Night&quot; as a zombie member of the Black Lantern Corps, wielding a power ring. He returned to plague Quentin Turnbull&#x27;s descendant Joshua. Joshua attacked Hex with a rocket launcher, but failed to destroy him. The young man pleaded for his life to Hex, joined by a Black Lantern version of Quentin who kills Joshua in cold blood. Hex and Quentin are killed when Hal Jordan defeats Nekron.

===The New 52===
During the 1880s in &quot;The New 52&quot;, psychologist Amadeus Arkham is recruited by Detective Lofton of the Gotham City Police Department to help solve the case of the Gotham Butcher. GCPD chief John Cromwell finds Arkham&#x27;s theories of the crime repugnant, as well as his decision to recruit Jonah Hex, who had recently caused a stir by coming to town. Even so, recognizing Hex&#x27;s experience as a tracker, Arkham suggests that the two of them join forces, performing a separate investigation into the case. Together, they uncover Gotham City&#x27;s sect of the Religion of Crime, and its relation to the Butcher case. The solution of the Butcher case (revealed to be a conspiracy by several prominent Gotham citizens belonging to the Religion Of Crime) was simply the first of many dangerous cases the two approached in their partnership. During his time in Gotham, Hex runs afoul of the Court Of Owls, Vandal Savage, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He also rekindles his love affair with Tallulah Black, another bounty-hunter.

After ending things with Arkham and preparing to return to the western territories, Hex encounters a semi-amnesiac Booster Gold and is accidentally thrown into the 21st century where he is initially put in Arkham Asylum, believed to be a delusional imposter who has adopted the identity of the historical Jonah Hex. After taking the current administrator, Dr. Jeremiah Arkham, hostage to escape the asylum, he convinces Jeremiah that he is indeed the same Jonah Hex who knew his great-grandfather, and after helping to take down a crazed gunman attacking a crowd of people, secures the legal assistance of Bruce Wayne to get released from custody. He also meets and forms a relationship with a young woman named Gina.

After several adventures where Hex encounters other heroes such as John Constantine, Swamp Thing, and Superman while trying to find a way back home, Hex is horrified when he and Gina discover his preserved corpse on permanent display in a Wild West exhibition at the Metropolis Museum. Despodent and depressed, Hex is involved in a severe DUI accident that leaves him in a coma for over a month. Upon awakening, he finds that the doctors used 21st century medical technology to repair his ruined face and eye along with his injuries from the accident. Discharged from the hospital, Hex and Gina encounter Booster Gold, who is eager to undo his mistake. Although Hex tries to dissuade her, Gina insists on travelling with him to the 19th century. She soon dies while crossing the desert, and all Hex can do is bury her and move on.

Soon after, Hex once again meets Tellulah Black, and discovers that he has been missing for about a year, during which time another man with similar injuries as his original appearance has taken on Hex&#x27;s identity and has been using his notoriety to commit crimes and form his own gang. Realizing that this is the same man whose preserved body he saw in the future, Hex adopts the identity of &quot;George Barrow&quot;, the man who has been on record as Hex&#x27;s killer, and kills &quot;Hex&quot; before letting a pair of carnival showmen run off with the body. He and Tallulah then ride off into the sunset together.

===DC Rebirth===
A robotic/alien version of Jonah Hex appears on a planet called Leone-5, modeled after the Wild West. He is introduced in the mini-series &quot;Adventures of the Super Sons&quot;, issue 9.

Jonah Hex made a brief appearance in the &quot;Batman Universe&quot; series.

He also is mentioned a few times by his great-great-granddaughter, Virginia &quot;Jinny&quot; Hex, who appears in &quot;Batman Universe&quot; and &quot;Young Justice&quot;, having taken up a career as a hero after learning that she inherited her ancestor&#x27;s exceptional abilities.

==Powers and abilities==
In most of his stories, Jonah Hex displays no supernatural or superhuman powers; however, he does possess some exceptional abilities, acquired through a combination of talent and training.

Despite being blind in his right eye on account of his disfigurement, Hex is an outstanding marksman who rarely misses his target, having been trained by the legendary Windy Taylor. He is extremely fast on the draw and can be seen in many stories gunning down multiple foes before any of them can get off a shot, and can wield two guns at the same time with equal proficiency. He is also a resourceful combatant, often relying on stealth, tricks, and improvised weapons and traps to defeat enemies, similar to DC comics character Deathstroke (who is also blind in his right eye). His reflexes are strong enough that he has proven to be faster on the draw than both Wild Bill Hickok and Batman. Already an experienced horseman, Hex became an expert at driving various motor vehicles during his time in the 21st century.

In the DC Universe, he is known as having almost superhuman-levels of skill and marksmanship with 19th-century weapons, such as revolvers and double-barrel shotguns. After Jonah Hex is transported to the future in &quot;Hex&quot;, he acquires a pair of Ruger Blackhawk .357 Magnums, largely because they are single action revolvers of the kind that he&#x27;s familiar with. Even with such outdated weapons, he still manages to outshoot foes armed with more modern weaponry.

Hex is an exceptional tracker, able to follow trails several days old through rain and mud in spite of his quarry&#x27;s best efforts to cover their tracks. He possesses a keen danger sense which warns him of ambushes and traps. This is not a supernatural ability, but rather an instinct honed through years of experience as a bounty-hunter and by fighting enemies much more powerful and deadlier than himself. Hex is also extremely tough and has been known to continue fighting even after suffering torture or severe injury.

Jonah Hex has a reputation throughout the West as a ruthless and prolific killer, but like Batman, he is bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent, as well as protect women and children no matter the circumstances. On many occasions, his reputation by itself has proven enough to deter potential foes. Knowing that the infamous Jonah Hex is pursuing them often unnerves Hex&#x27;s targets so badly that they make fatal mistakes, such as wasting ammunition, falling into traps, or turning and engaging Hex in a desperate stand-off that enables him to finish them easily.

In &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #16 when the timeline of the DC Universe was changed by the Legion of Super-Villains, Batman and Superman ended up being catapulted to multiple alternate timelines to restore everything back in its original order. In one timeline, they end up in a modern-day Gotham City in which Western-themed superheroes act as law enforcement officers. While Superman was attending to a badly wounded Batman, Jonah Hex tracked them down and managed to kill the Man of Steel using Kryptonite bullets. Although Superman wasn&#x27;t really killed, it was heavily implied that this was done primarily because in that story arc, the only way for Superman and Batman to be transported to another timeline is for them to die.

Jonah Hex has, in many timelines, met and fought Batman. In &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #16, Hex overpowered Batman in hand-to-hand combat (albeit Batman had been heavily wounded and thus couldn&#x27;t fight back with his usual ability). In &quot;&quot;, Hex and Batman face off in a showdown. Even though he has experience in disarming gunmen with his batarangs, Batman was still outdrawn by Hex, and Hex shoots him in the stomach. However, Batman at the time was suffering from amnesia and lacked most of his skills, including his hand-to-eye coordination.

The 2010 live-action movie gives Hex an additional power: due to his being brought back from the brink of death after being hung on a cross and tortured by Quentin Turnbull, he is shown to be able to raise the dead for a few moments and force them to speak truthfully. However, this power has not been seen in comics or any other media before or since the film.

==Supporting cast==
As he was not a traditional superhero, Jonah Hex never amassed a &quot;rogues&#x27; gallery&quot; comparable to that of other costumed comic-book heroes such as Batman or the Flash, though he had a few adversaries who returned from time to time. The first and most notable of these to date was Quentin Turnbull, who was initially known only as the &quot;man with the eagle-topped cane&quot;. Turnbull was the father of Hex&#x27;s oldest friend, Jeb Turnbull. During the American Civil War, Jonah, then a Confederate cavalryman, surrendered himself to the Union forces after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, but he refused to betray where his fellow-Confederates were camped. A Union soldier was able to determine the location of their camp anyway by examining the dirt in the hooves of Jonah&#x27;s horse. Jonah&#x27;s comrades were all captured and then later massacred during the &quot;Fort Charlotte Massacre&quot;, including Jeb. Believing the false rumors that Jonah had helped plan the massacre, Turnbull swore to avenge his son.

One such scheme involved Turnbull hiring an unnamed stage actor to impersonate Hex to try and frame him as a murderous outlaw. This actor, naming himself &quot;The Chameleon&quot;, was eventually hideously scarred in a fire started by Hex, and he also swore revenge on the bounty-hunter.

El Papagayo was a Mexican bandit running guns. Hex was hired by the United States Secret Service (actually a man hired by Turnbull to pose as a Secret Service agent) to infiltrate El Papagayo&#x27;s band and bring him to justice. Hex was unsuccessful, and he and Papagayo met several more times over the years until Hex finally stabbed him dead in a confrontation.

Jonah Hex also had a number of allies and supporting characters during many of his adventures, but most wound up getting killed in the course of helping him. An exception is Tallulah Black, a character introduced in 2007. As a young woman, Tallulah was savagely raped and mutilated by the men who murdered her family. She was saved by Hex, who helped her gain vengeance. She would go on to become a bounty-huntress herself and eventually Hex&#x27;s lover. Tallulah eventually became pregnant by Hex, but their child, a girl, was killed before being born. (&quot;Jonah Hex&quot; vol. 2, #50).

Joshua Dazzleby is Jonah&#x27;s half-brother and is introduced in the graphic novel &quot;Jonah Hex: No Way Back&quot; (2010) as a preacher and elected sheriff of a moralistic town that bans saloons and prostitution. Dazzleby is the opposite of Hex: he was raised properly, and as such, is respected and has risen to a position of leadership among his peers. He welcomes his half-brother when the latter tracks him down, but Hex ultimately chooses to leave when he realizes that he doesn&#x27;t belong. Nevertheless, the two brothers part on amicable terms.

According to Frazier, the inspiration for the song came from reading Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray&#x27;s take on the character in &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; vol. 2 and his own love for Sergio Leone&#x27;s Man With No Name films. The song, which features Frazier on acoustic guitar and vocals, is in narrative form and contains a verse that relates Hex&#x27;s origin story as told by Palmiotti and Gray in their three-part &quot;Retribution&quot; storyline that ran from issues #13–15. Ian Frazier and Long Beach musician Robert Conrad performed the song live for Palmiotti at the inaugural Long Beach Comic Con in 2009. Due to copyright concerns, Frazier removed the song from iTunes in 2011.
* Ghoultown&#x27;s album &quot;Tales from the Dead West&quot; features a song called &quot;Death of Jonah Hex&quot;.
* Jonah Hex&#x27;s alien abduction in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #3 is adapted into &quot;Westerner&quot;, a nine-minute song by French-Canadian electro-rock band Judge Rock.
* Jonah Hex is featured in the song &quot;By the Gun&quot;, which is part of Nerdcore artist Dr. Awkward&#x27;s EP &quot;New 52&quot;.

==Lawsuit==

In 1996, musicians Johnny and Edgar Winter filed suit against DC and the creators of the &quot;Jonah Hex: Riders of the Worm and Such&quot; limited series, claiming, amongst other things, defamation: two characters named the Autumn Brothers in the series strongly resemble the Winters. Writer Joe Lansdale said on the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund site:

The judge agreed and ruled in favor of the defendants, saying parody was covered by the First Amendment. The briefs were refiled in June 2002 through the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation and while the decision was upheld, the comic was deemed not to be &quot;transformative&quot; raising possible future problems for parody. In 2003, the Supreme Court of California sided with DC.

==Reception==
&quot;IGN&quot; ranked Jonah Hex as the 73rd Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time, stating that &quot;his distinctive appearance and engrossing adventures set Hex apart from the rest of the cowboy crowd&quot;.

<doc id="553832" wikidata="Q1424828" url="?curid=553832" title="Son Volt">
<text>Son Volt is an American rock band formed in 1994 by Jay Farrar after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo. The band&#x27;s current line-up consists of Farrar (vocals, guitar), Andrew DuPlantis (bass guitar), John Horton (guitar), Mark Patterson (drums), and Mark Spencer (keyboard, steel guitar). In addition to playing alternative rock, the band is considered a staple of the alternative country rock movement of the 1990s. The band&#x27;s sound also is rooted in folk rock and Americana. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001, before reforming in 2004.

==History==
=== Early Years, &quot;Trace&quot;, &quot;Straightaways&quot;, and &quot;Wide Swing Tremolo&quot; ===
The group formed after the alternative country rock act Uncle Tupelo broke up due to tensions between Farrar and bandmate Jeff Tweedy. After Uncle Tupelo split, Tweedy formed the alternative rock act Wilco, while Farrar decided to form another act. While forming Son Volt, Farrar met Jim and Dave Boquist during the final Uncle Tupelo tour and teamed up with former Uncle Tupelo drummer Mike Heidorn to create the band. The group performed and recorded in the Minneapolis area in late 1994 and performed its first concert at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis on June 16, 1995. While half of the band was rooted in the Minneapolis area, Farrar and Heidorn lived in the St. Louis area, and the band used both cities as bases for its operations during the first couple of years.

Son Volt&#x27;s first album, &quot;Trace&quot;, met with critical acclaim and topped many &quot;best-of&quot; lists in 1995. It was a moderate commercial success; the first track &quot;Windfall&quot; became very popular in the alt-country scene, while the band released &quot;Drown&quot; as a single which charted #10 on the mainstream rock charts and #25 on the modern rock charts. By 2009, &quot;Trace&quot; had sold 297,000 copies in the United States.

1997&#x27;s &quot;Straightaways&quot; followed in the same vein as &quot;Trace&quot; with even a more acoustic feel, leading some music critics to give negative reviews, but strong and positive reviews came from outlets such as the Orlando Sentinel and the Chicago Tribune. 1998&#x27;s &quot;Wide Swing Tremolo&quot; featured a heavier rock sound and received mostly positive reviews from music outlets. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;many of the songs ... return to the power and purity of the band’s brilliant 1995 debut, &quot;Trace&quot;.&quot;

=== Hiatus and return ===
Farrar announced a hiatus from Son Volt after their 1999 tour. Beginning in 2001, Jay Farrar released several solo efforts that postponed further releases from Son Volt. Farrar reformed with the original members of Son Volt to record a song for a tribute album for Alejandro Escovedo. The sessions reportedly went so well that Farrar and the other band members intended to record once again in the autumn of 2004. Just prior to the sessions, however, Farrar and the other band members abruptly ended negotiations. Farrar formed a new version of the band with a different line-up and released an album on Transmit Sound/Sony Legacy, &quot;Okemah and the Melody of Riot&quot;, a folk-rock album based on protest music that had been influenced by Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. in 2005. That same year also saw the release of &quot;A Retrospective: 1995-2000&quot;, which gathered highlights from this era, along with previously unreleased recordings. 2006 saw the release of a live DVD, &quot;Six String Belief&quot;, which was recorded at The Orange Peel in Asheville, NC.

=== Band reformed and new music ===
In 2007, the band returned to an alternative rock and alt-country sound and released a studio album called &quot;The Search&quot;. The Americana- and folk-influenced album &quot;American Central Dust&quot; followed, released by Rounder Records on July 7, 2009. Their next project was a Bakersfield Sound-influenced album aptly named &quot;Honky Tonk&quot;, which was released March 5, 2013, also by Rounder Records. A large scale tour followed the release of the album. On February 17, 2017, the band released &quot;Notes of Blue&quot; on Farrar&#x27;s label, Transmit Sound.

=== &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Electro Melodier&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Union&quot;, was released on March 28, 2019 on Farrar&#x27;s Transmit Sound label and distributed by Thirty Tigers Records. The album consisted of songs that were highly critical of the election of US President Donald Trump and his administration. Many of the songs were commentaries on middle-class economics, freedom of the press, and immigration. Son Volt&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Electro Melodier&quot;, was released on July 30, 2021. In early summer 2021, guitarist Chris Frame announced that he would be leaving the band to pursue other interests and was replaced by former Bottle Rockets guitarist John Horton. The tribute album &quot;Day of the Doug&quot; followed in 2023.

==Musical style==
Son Volt&#x27;s music ranges from quiet folk ballads reminiscent of &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, to heartland rock in the spirit of Neil Young with Crazy Horse. The band&#x27;s sound features a heavy alternative rock sound in many places, all while basing their music in mostly an Americana style. Reviews refer to the band as alternative country pioneers, a &quot;staple in the alt-country scene&quot; or &quot;a cult favorite&quot;, with their music &quot;spanning a few musical niches&quot;, but based in Americana.

<text>Martin David Crowe (22 September 1962 – 3 March 2016) was a New Zealand cricketer, Test and ODI captain as well as a commentator. He played for the New Zealand national cricket team between 1982 and 1995, and is regarded as one of the country&#x27;s greatest batsmen.

Crowe made his first-class debut for Auckland aged of 17, and his Test debut for New Zealand aged 19. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1985, and was credited as one of the &quot;best young batsmen in the world&quot;. Crowe was appointed New Zealand&#x27;s captain in 1990, and led the team until 1993. In a Test against Sri Lanka in 1991, he scored 299 runs, breaking the record for the highest score by a New Zealander. In the same match, he also set a new record for the highest partnership in Test cricket, putting on 467 runs with Andrew Jones. At the 1992 World Cup, which New Zealand co-hosted with Australia, Crowe was named the player of the tournament, and led his team to a semi-final. By the time he finished his international career in 1995, he held the records for the most Test and One Day International (ODI) runs scored for New Zealand.

After retiring from playing, Crowe remained involved in cricket as a writer and commentator. He was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012, but was declared cancer-free the following year. However, the disease returned in 2014, and eventually led to his death in 2016. He was also one of the drivers behind the ICC World Test Championship concept which was initially proposed in 2009, but did not eventuate until 2019.

==Early life==
Crowe was born in Henderson, a suburb of Auckland, to a family of cricketers. His father, Dave Crowe, played first-class cricket for Canterbury and Wellington and his older brother, Jeff Crowe, played Test cricket. One of the brothers&#x27; first cousins is actor Russell Crowe. In 1968, Martin Crowe joined his father and brother at the Cornwall Cricket Club, with which he maintained a lifelong connection. At Auckland Grammar School, which he attended from 1976 to 1980, he was deputy head boy in his final year. He captained the school&#x27;s cricket team, and also played rugby union, as a wing. He was also the great-grandson of All Black Francis Jervis (his mother&#x27;s maternal grandfather).

==Domestic career==
Crowe made his first-class debut in January 1980, playing for Auckland against Canterbury. Aged 17 at the time, he scored 51 runs in his first innings, which was his team&#x27;s highest score. In 1981, having been named New Zealand&#x27;s Young Cricketer of the Year, Crowe was given the opportunity to spend six months on the ground staff of Lord&#x27;s, simultaneously playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club. Returning to New Zealand for the 1981–82 domestic season, he scored a maiden first-class century, making 150 runs against Canterbury. Crowe switched to Central Districts after the 1982–83 season. His career for Central Districts was limited by his international duties, but in 32 first-class appearances (from 1983 to 1990), he averaged 68.72, with 13 centuries. Crowe&#x27;s highest score for the team (and in all New Zealand domestic cricket) was 242, made against Otago in January 1990. That season was his last for Central Districts, as he transferred to Wellington prior to the 1990–91 season. In five seasons for Wellington, Crowe made only nine first-class appearances, the last of which came during the 1994–95 season.

In 1984, Crowe signed to play English county cricket with Somerset. He had great success in his first County Championship season, finishing second behind Vic Marks in Somerset&#x27;s averages and placing sixth for overall runs scored. However, Crowe did not return to the county until the 1987 season. In that year&#x27;s County Championship, he placed third in the overall averages (behind teammate Steve Waugh and Northamptonshire&#x27;s Roger Harper), and also placed third for overall runs scored (behind Graeme Hick and Graeme Fowler). Against Hampshire in the 1987 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup (a limited-overs competition), he scored 155 not out from 119 balls, which was the highest one-day score of his career. Crowe returned for a final season at Somerset in 1988, but was able to play only a handful of matches. From 48 matches for Somerset, he finished with a first-class batting average of 59.46.

==International career==

===Early years===
Crowe made his international debut for New Zealand in February 1982, in a One Day International (ODI) game against Australia played at Auckland&#x27;s Eden Park. He made his Test debut at the end of the month, playing against the same team at Wellington&#x27;s Basin Reserve. At the time, only six New Zealanders had made their Test debuts at a younger age. At the 1983 World Cup in England, Crowe played in all six of his team&#x27;s matches, with only Geoff Howarth scoring more runs. His highest score was 97, made in the opening game against England. In January 1984, when England toured, Crowe scored his first Test century – 100 runs exactly.

In 1985, Crowe made two scores of 188. The first came on a mid-year tour of the West Indies, with Crowe at the crease for 462 balls and over nine hours. The second came in an end-of-year tour of Australia, in a match that was better known for Richard Hadlee&#x27;s 15-wicket haul. In a Test against the West Indies in February 1987, Crowe and John Wright put on 241 runs for the third wicket, setting a new third-wicket record for New Zealand. Later in the year, Crowe played in the 1987 World Cup in India. He finished as New Zealand&#x27;s leading run-scorer, making three half-centuries from six matches, although his team struggled (winning only against Zimbabwe).

===Captaincy and 1992 World Cup===
Crowe was first appointed captain of New Zealand for a tour of Pakistan in October and November 1990. Before that point, he had been regarded as &quot;captain designate&quot; to John Wright, who was nearing the end of his international career. Crowe&#x27;s second series as captain came in early 1991, when Sri Lanka toured. In the first Test of the series, played in Wellington, Crowe scored 299 runs in his team&#x27;s second innings, setting a new record for the highest score by a New Zealander. He was at the crease for 523 balls and over ten hours, and scored 29 fours and three sixes. Crowe and Andrew Jones (who scored 186) put on 467 runs for the third wicket, setting a new record for the highest partnership in Test cricket. The pair helped New Zealand, behind by 323 runs on the first innings, to score 671/4 at the end of the final day&#x27;s play, which at the time was the highest score in the third innings of a Test.

At the 1992 World Cup, which New Zealand co-hosted with Australia, Crowe finished as the tournament&#x27;s leading run-scorer with 456 runs, and was named player of the tournament. One of his highlights was an innings of 100 not out in the opening match against Australia, which New Zealand won by 37 runs. In the tournament&#x27;s group stages, New Zealand lost only a single game, against Pakistan. They topped the table, qualifying for a home semi-final against the same team (their first finals appearance since the 1979 tournament). Crowe chose to bat first, and scored 91 runs from 83 balls to help his team to a total of 262/7. However, when Pakistan batted, he chose to stay off the field and rest an injured hamstring, with John Wright taking over on the field. Pakistan won the match by four wickets. Crowe largely blamed himself for his team&#x27;s loss, and in a 2014 article said that his decision not to take the field was &quot;a curse that had tormented me for over two decades&quot;.

Crowe&#x27;s last series as captain of New Zealand came when Australia toured in February and March 1993. He had struggled with injuries for several years, and was replaced by Ken Rutherford to allow him to concentrate on his form. However, he returned as captain for one final match in November 1993, the first game of a series against Australia. In total, Crowe captained New Zealand in sixteen Tests, winning only two. He had a much better record in ODIs, with the team winning 21 out of 44 matches under his captaincy. Crowe was described by broadcaster Bryan Waddle as a &quot;proactive rather than reactive&quot; leader, who was &quot;always prepared to be innovative&quot;. He had a troubled relationship with the media throughout his captaincy, in one case using a press conference to confront a journalist who had published an article implying he had AIDS.

===Later years===
In his first series after giving up the captaincy, a 1994 tour of England, Crowe scored consecutive centuries, making 142 at Lord&#x27;s and 115 at Old Trafford. His series tally of 380 runs was the second-highest of his career. Crowe continued playing for several more seasons, eventually retiring after a tour of India in October and November 1995. He scored his final international hundred in the first ODI of the tour, aged 33. Crowe finished with 5,444 Test runs and 4,704 ODI runs, both New Zealand records at the time. At the time of his retirement, only Sir Richard Hadlee had played more Tests for New Zealand. Crowe held the record for the most Test centuries by a New Zealander at the time, finishing with seventeen (including one against every Test-playing team but South Africa).

In the 1992 New Year Honours, Crowe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket. On 28 February 2015, Crowe was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was inducted in a ceremony during the lunch break of New Zealand&#x27;s win against Australia during the 2015 World Cup.

=== International centuries ===

Crowe made 21 centuries in international cricket, 17 in Tests and 4 in One Day Internationals. He scored his first Test century against England, also at the Basin Reserve on 20 January 1984, scoring 100. He scored his final Test century, also against England at Old Trafford, Manchester on 30 June 1994, scoring 115. He played his final Test match against India at the Barabati Stadium, Cuttack on 8 November 1995, having played 77 matches. His highest score in Tests is 299, scored against Sri Lanka at the Basin Reserve on 31 January 1991.

He scored his first ODI century against England, also at Eden Park, scoring 105 not out. He scored his final ODI century against India at the Keenan Stadium, Jamshedpur on 15 November 1995, scoring 107 not out, his highest score in ODIs. He played his final ODI in the final game of the same series against India at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur on 26 November 1995, having played 143 matches.

==Later life==

===Coaching===
After his retirement, Crowe helped develop a local variation of cricket, called &quot;Cricket Max&quot;, and became a television commentator and pundit. He was a board member of the South Sydney Rabbitohs Rugby League Football Club of which Russell Crowe is part owner. He was roped in as the CEO of the management team of Royal Challengers Bangalore, a team in the Indian Premier League. Midway through the season the owner Vijay Mallya expressed displeasure over the team and its performance in the league by sacking its bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and mentor Charu Sharma blaming them for dismal team performance. Later in October of the same year, Crowe parted ways with the team and brought in Ray Jennings, the former coach of the South African National Cricket Team as the head coach of the team. Sources suggested that Mallya was unhappy with the team he had and held Crowe and his management team responsible for the debacle. He has also mentored current New Zealand batsmen, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson. In 2014, he predicted and named Kane Williamson, Virat Kohli, Steve Smith and Joe Root in the young Fab Four list for test cricket.

===Attempted comeback===
On 19 May 2011, Crowe commented on Twitter that he wanted to improve his fitness by setting a goal to play first-class cricket again. He cited that he was only 3 first-class matches away from 250 matches, and 392 runs short of 20,000 runs.

Crowe took his first step to playing first-class cricket by playing at club level at the age of 49 (he was due to debut much earlier, but was delayed due to a groin injury). He played for the Cornwall reserve grade team, captaining them and batting at No.3 against Papatoetoe in a second-division club match in Auckland, the same club where his father played grade cricket.

===Illness and death===
On 15 October 2012, it was revealed that Crowe had been diagnosed with lymphoma. He blamed the illness on a failing immune system, which had been weakened by various illnesses picked up while touring India in the 1980s and 1990s.

On 5 June 2013, Crowe announced that he was free of cancer on &quot;Campbell Live&quot;, but he would cut his ties with cricket, as he was a self-proclaimed &quot;recovering addict to cricket, much like an alcoholic&quot;. Crowe says he wore a &#x27;mask&#x27; from the age of 22, due to high expectations, but at the age of 51 was happy to &#x27;look at the real me&#x27;.

In 2014, Crowe announced that the lymphoma had returned and subsequently indicated that his chances of survival beyond 12 months were less than 5% and also of his wish to see the 2015 Cricket World Cup in February and March 2015. He also attended the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final between Australia and New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which in fact was his last public appearance.

Crowe died of complications from the disease in Auckland on 3 March 2016. His funeral was held in Holy Trinity Cathedral in a Christian ceremony in Parnell, Auckland.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Crowe married Simone Curtice, an interior designer. They separated five years later, in 1996, and Crowe later entered into a relationship with Suzanne Taylor, with whom he had one daughter. He and Taylor separated in 2005. In 2009, Crowe married for a third time, to Lorraine Downes, a former Miss Universe. They remained married until his death.

==Playing style==
Upon his death, Crowe was eulogised in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;not just one of New Zealand’s greatest ever cricketers, but one of the most elegant batsmen the world has yet seen&quot;. A 2012 article by Mark Nicholas described him as &quot;upright, orthodox and immensely strong&quot; at the wicket, and praised the &quot;speed and grace of the footwork&quot; and &quot;perfect head position&quot;. Nicholas thought the elegance of Crowe&#x27;s batting was at odds with his physical size – he was &quot;a big man in a small man&#x27;s game&quot;. Writing in his retirement, Crowe emphasised the importance of instinct in batting, and the need to avoid premeditating a shot.

During his early career, Crowe was also often used as a &quot;bits and pieces bowler&quot;, with his &quot;lively in-swingers&quot; faring especially well in English conditions. He was regarded as an &quot;outstanding&quot; fieldsman, and against Zimbabwe in the 1987 World Cup dismissed David Houghton with an outstretched diving catch that was said to have won New Zealand the game. As a captain, Crowe was known for his use of innovative techniques, most notably opening the bowling with a spinner, Dipak Patel, at the 1992 World Cup. He often had highly developed bowling and fielding plans, regularly rotating his bowlers and changing his fields to put pressure on opposing batsmen. Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja described Crowe as &quot;an imaginative leader who maximised his team&#x27;s potential and resources by thoughtful captaincy and out-of-the-box tactics&quot;. Crowe was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame in 2015 and the NZC Hall of Fame in 2024 as one of the First XI.

<text>The Joh for Canberra campaign, initially known as the Joh for PM campaign, was an attempt by Queensland National Party premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to become Prime Minister of Australia. The campaign was announced in January 1987 and drew substantial support from Queensland businessmen and some conservative politicians. The campaign caused a split in the federal Coalition. It did not attract widespread support and collapsed in June 1987. The Australian Labor Party, led by Bob Hawke, went on to win the 1987 federal election with an increased majority, gaining its highest-ever number of seats. Bjelke-Petersen came under increasing scrutiny as the Fitzgerald Inquiry gained traction, and was forced out of politics altogether in December 1987.

==The lead-up to the campaign==
Bjelke-Petersen became Premier of Queensland in 1968. Although he came close to being ousted from office in 1970, he went on to become the longest-serving premier in Queensland history, and was returned to office convincingly in several elections up to the early 1980s. In 1983 and 1984, he had communicated his interest in challenging what he saw as a dangerous push towards socialism within the Hawke Labor government.

Labor won power at the federal level under Bob Hawke at the 1983 election. Bjelke-Petersen and Queensland National Party president Sir Robert Sparkes spearheaded a conservative backlash against Hawke, based in Queensland. The aim of movement was to &quot;dismantle Labor&#x27;s &#x27;socialist&#x27; legislation, including Medicare, to support Queensland-style free enterprise and to introduce a flat-tax system&quot;. After the state Liberal Party ended the Coalition in Queensland a few months before the 1983 Queensland state election (the National Party was traditionally the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition in Queensland), Bjelke-Petersen played up fears of a Labor-Liberal coalition and led the Nationals to victory, claiming 41 seats in the 82-seat Legislative Assembly of Queensland—one short of a majority. He then persuaded two Liberals to cross the floor and join the Nationals, allowing them to govern in their own right for the first time. At the following election, in 1986, the Nationals won an outright majority for the only time, winning a record 55% of the seats in Queensland parliament.

The idea of Bjelke-Petersen becoming prime minister was first explicitly discussed with him by Gold Coast businessmen Brian Ray and Mike Gore, in autumn 1986, not long after his comprehensive state election victory. Gore later claimed that Bjelke-Petersen was reluctant to pursue a position in federal politics. However, according to Ray, Bjelke-Petersen expressed enthusiasm for the idea and had to convince Ray and Gore of its merit. The base of the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign was a group of Queensland businessmen, nicknamed the &quot;white shoe brigade&quot;, who had enjoyed substantial patronage from the Bjelke-Petersen government. Despite Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s insistence that his campaign was driven by popular enthusiasm, the base of support for the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign was always quite narrow. In the 1984 federal election, the National Party had polled only 10.63% of the vote and won 21 seats, compared to 45 for the Liberal Party and 82 for Labor.

In 1987, John Howard and Ian Sinclair were poised to lead the Liberal and National parties respectively into the 1987 election against Bob Hawke. Bjelke-Petersen believed that Howard and Sinclair had drifted too far from their conservative principles and stood no chance of defeating the Labor government in the election. After his decisive victory in the 1986 state election, Bjelke-Petersen became the &quot;superstar of non-Labor politics in Australia&quot;, though his support was concentrated in rural areas and on the far right of the political spectrum. That apparent momentum gave Bjelke-Petersen a feeling of invulnerability, and the mistaken belief that the dynamics of Queensland politics could be replicated at a federal level.

==The campaign platform==
Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s candidacy rested on his promotion of a 25% flat tax rate for all Australians, irrespective of income, a proposal that drew the support of Queensland businessmen and those on the right of politics. At one point, members of the &quot;white shoe brigade&quot; reportedly pledged millions of dollars to help the campaign, although the money never materialised. Despite the 25% flat tax rate being the basis of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign for prime minister, it was subsequently argued that he had &quot;no idea of how such a tax would operate [and] still less of what was needed for responsible introduction&quot;. Other goals of his campaign, identified by Bjelke-Petersen, were restricting the power of unions, reversing Aboriginal land rights decisions and promoting states&#x27; rights.

The Nationals had a limited base of support and were unlikely to become Australia&#x27;s major non-Labor party. The belief that Bjelke-Petersen could have defeated Bob Hawke in the 1987 election has been called &quot;one of the greatest delusions ever entertained in Australian politics&quot;. Ironically, before Bjelke-Petersen began his ill-fated run for the office of prime minister, Bob Hawke and Labor stood a very serious chance of losing government, deflated by the ill-fated attempt to introduce the unpopular Australia Card, the failed &quot;tax summit&quot;, designed to gain support for federal treasurer Paul Keating&#x27;s proposed consumption tax, and the declining terms of trade.

==Joh for PM==
Bjelke-Petersen made his intention to run for prime minister explicit on 1 January 1987, generating a flurry of media activity. It was speculated that Bjelke-Petersen would run for a federal seat in Queensland, with Wide Bay and Fairfax being singled out as possibilities. The campaign identified thirteen marginal Labor seats and eight marginal Liberal seats that it believed were viable targets for Bjelke-Petersen and The Nationals.

Despite the extensive media coverage, the campaign drew criticism from the outset. The leader of the federal Liberal Party, John Howard, said that Bjelke-Petersen was &quot;strong on incentive but short on reality&quot;. Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Arena&quot; magazine described Bjelke-Petersen as a &quot;populist leader... without institutional backing&quot;, who would inevitably be defeated by the established federal parties of Labor, the Nationals and the Liberals. Prime Minister Hawke could barely contain his &quot;delight&quot; at the conservative infighting and welcomed a potential challenge by Bjelke-Petersen.

A peculiar irony of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s run for federal office was that his appeal had always rested on his claim to represent Queensland&#x27;s interests in the face of a hostile federal political system. His pro-Queensland and anti-Commonwealth &quot;Canberra bashing&quot; was the most consistent aspect of his tenure as Queensland premier. Despite the challenges he faced, Bjelke-Petersen remained outspoken about his chances of becoming prime minister, declaring that nobody else in Australian politics possessed &quot;my experience in politics, my policies for Australia, and my determination to make them work&quot;.

Although he was outwardly confident, Bjelke-Petersen had few political allies in his campaign, even on the conservative side of politics. The most significant political figure to openly back Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign was Tasmanian premier Robin Gray, who enjoyed a strong personal rapport with Bjelke-Petersen. Key Liberal Party figures, such as Andrew Peacock, also sympathised with Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s run for office, but failed to sever their ties with the federal Coalition. Joseph Siracusa, who served as Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s national security advisor in the campaign, later claimed that Peacock and fellow Liberal powerbroker Ian McLachlan played &quot;important behind the scenes roles in the affair&quot;. Siracusa recalled a conversation with prominent Queensland National Party minister Russ Hinze, in which Hinze claimed that Andrew Peacock had secretly backed the &quot;Joh for PM&quot; campaign to destabilise John Howard&#x27;s leadership of the Liberal Party. According to Siracusa, Bjelke-Petersen had intended on a partnership whereby Bjelke-Petersen would become prime minister with Peacock as his deputy, though the fine details and practical considerations of that plan were never considered. Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;Courier Mail&quot; newspaper threw its support behind the campaign and insisted that a Bjelke-Petersen victory was possible, while acknowledging that any such victory would depend on the ability of Bjelke-Petersen to carry at least twenty of Queensland twenty-four seats in the House of Representatives.

Bjelke-Petersen held a rally in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, on 31 January 1987, warning that the Coalition could not win government in the upcoming election, and establishing himself as the &quot;folksy alternative&quot; to John Howard and the Liberal Party. A &quot;Newspoll&quot; recorded from 6–8 February 1987 found that 60% of voters believed a Bjelke-Petersen–Peacock ticket would be best placed to win the upcoming federal election, against only 22% in favour of Howard and Sinclair.

==Split from Coalition==
At the end of February 1987, the Queensland National Party decided to withdraw its twelve federal members of parliament from the Coalition, and demanded that federal National Party leader Ian Sinclair also withdraw because of &quot;basic differences in taxation and other philosophies and policies&quot; between the Liberal and National parties. Within the Queensland National Party, the party president, Sir Robert Sparkes, enforced support for Bjelke-Petersen, making practical opposition within the Queensland ranks unlikely. However, tensions persisted, even amongst Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s closest followers.

Although Sparkes had agreed to run the campaign, by then known as &quot;Joh for PM&quot;, he took the post only reluctantly and had tried to dissuade Bjelke-Petersen from running for federal office. Privately, Bjelke-Petersen and Sparkes had come to detest one another, with &quot;their hatred for each other overwhelming the courtly setting and polite manners&quot;. Bjelke-Petersen later claimed that Sparkes was responsible for the subsequent failure of the &quot;Joh for PM&quot; campaign. The formal notice approving Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s run for the prime ministership was passed by a Queensland National Party Central Council in February 1987. It read:
: That the National Party of Australia (Qld) fully supports the move by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to attain the Prime Ministership so that he can put in place an anti-socialist federal government equipped with appropriate policies and the will to implement those policies...

Despite their success in the Queensland branch, Bjelke-Petersen and his newly independent Nationals faction received a humiliating setback in the Northern Territory election on 2 March, with the National Party failing to achieve much success, despite Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s patronage and the Country Liberals continuing to dominate the territory. On 10 April, Queensland National MPs withdrew from the Coalition, leaving them in &quot;the ridiculous position of being half in and half out of the federal National Party&quot;.

The perceived obstinacy of the Queensland National Party drew the ire of many senior Coalition members. Ian Sinclair refused to join Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign and attempted to preserve the federal Coalition. On 29 April, as Hawke continued to capitalise on the Coalition&#x27;s disunity, John Howard slammed the &quot;real wreckers... Bjelke-Petersen and Sparkes, and the unilateral action of the Queensland branch [of the National Party] which set itself on a course of destruction with the Coalition&quot;. Although Howard was publicly critical of the &quot;Joh for PM&quot; campaign, it has been alleged that he was actually desperate to appease Bjelke-Petersen, at one point flying to Queensland to seek a compromise agreement.

The Coalition split in early May, with Sinclair looking increasingly impotent, unable to ensure the loyalty of all National Party members. At that point, Bob Sparkes reneged on his loyalty to Bjelke-Petersen and withdrew from the campaign. With his pool of supporters steadily decreasing, an effective challenge to the federal Coalition from Bjelke-Petersen began to look more and more unlikely.

==Media==
Newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch, particularly &quot;The Australian&quot;, offered enthusiastic early support for the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; and &quot;Joh for PM&quot; campaigns. &quot;The Australian&quot; was edited by a pro Bjelke-Petersen editor, Lee Hollings, and vigorously advocated for Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign, providing it with &quot;much-needed momentum&quot; in early January 1987. The stance taken by Murdoch, combined with sympathetic coverage in the Brisbane &quot;Courier Mail&quot;, meant that the campaign received a great deal of positive media coverage. Some commentators have argued that &quot;The Australian&quot; did much to contribute to the defeat of the conservatives in the 1987 federal election. Liberal politician, Ian Macphee, has argued that the promotion of the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; and &quot;Joh for PM&quot; campaigns in &quot;The Australian&quot; was a case of the paper going &quot;out of its way to fan the flames of disunity&quot;, contributing to the Hawke government&#x27;s eventual victory.

Local dissent against the Bjelke-Petersen media narrative came from smaller publications. The University of Queensland&#x27;s &quot;Semper Floreat&quot;, and the independent magazine &quot;The Cane Toad Times&quot;, provided authentic voices of Queensland opposition to Joh Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign. &quot;The Cane Toad Times&quot; only dealt with the campaign in reference to the Fitzgerald Inquiry that ousted Bjelke-Petersen in late 1987, stating that issues like the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign, as with the Bjelke-Petersen government&#x27;s aggressive support of the Springboks rugby tour of 1971, as well as the industrial disputes of 1984, had served to &quot;keep the spotlight off the only real problem the National Party government had in Queensland [which was] corruption&quot;.

&quot;Semper Floreat&quot; was a persistent critic of the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign. In its regular column, &quot;Letters from Kingaroy&quot;, the publication repeatedly mocked Bjelke-Petersen and his attempt to be elected to federal office. What both &quot;Semper Floreat&quot; and &quot;The Cane Toad Times&quot; shared was a view of Bjelke-Petersen as a repressive and autocratic figure, trying to replicate a tradition of misgovernment on the federal stage. &quot;The Cane Toad Times&quot; satirically referred to Queensland as a &quot;new Reich&quot;, while &quot;Semper&quot; claimed that &quot;a lot of Queensland journalists have a sense of futility because of the immense control Joh Bjelke-Petersen holds in this state&quot;.

In Brisbane, the media had a degree of diversity that was largely absent from the rest of the state. Brisbane was also the area of Queensland where Bjelke-Petersen enjoyed the least amount of support. Outside the cosmopolitan south-east of Queensland, he and the Nationals &quot;benefited from a less diverse and competitive mass media&quot;, which helped to ensure their continuing electoral success.

==End of campaign==
For all its fanfare, the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign ended with a whimper rather than a bang. In May 1987, the expectations of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign were revised downwards to promoting Senate candidates such as John Stone, who ran under the New Nationals banner, and the slogan &quot;Joh for PM&quot; was scrapped in favour of &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot;, When prime minister, Bob Hawke, called a double dissolution election on 27 May 1987, Bjelke-Petersen was in the United States, visiting Disneyland, and had not even nominated for a federal seat. His supporters at home rushed to find candidates for a pro-Bjelke-Petersen party, but were largely unsuccessful.

Despite the media furore created by the campaign, Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s bid for federal government lacked a &quot;solid organisational basis and significant nationwide support&quot;. The bid collapsed and Bjelke-Petersen withdrew from his attempt to win a seat in federal parliament. Nonetheless, the effects of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s grab for power were felt nationwide. With the National Party fractured, different campaigns all ran simultaneously, including &quot;the Joh campaign, the Sinclair campaign [and] independent Joh campaigns&quot;, leading to confusion among voters.

In the federal election, Labor performed exceptionally well in Queensland, gaining four seats to bring their Queensland tally to 13 of 24 seats. Although Bjelke-Petersen had withdrawn from the nationwide contest, the National Party still ran against the Liberals in many seats, and ran independent Senate tickets in every state except New South Wales. The federal National Party suffered a net loss of two seats, failing to expand upon its traditional rural base and hampered by disunity within its ranks.

In addition to a large number of three-cornered contests, many of the practices that had worked so well for Bjelke-Petersen over the previous 19 years backfired on him. Many swinging voters outside of Queensland, alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, opted to vote Labor in order to ensure that the Coalition would be defeated. Queensland ALP secretary Peter Beattie remarked that &quot;we couldn&#x27;t have done it without Joh&quot;.

However, Bjelke-Petersen remained unrepentant. In an interview recorded in the aftermath of the election loss, Bjelke-Petersen insisted that he did not bear any of the blame for the result, and that the only thing he had to apologise for was withdrawing from the contest. He later tried to shift the blame to Robert Sparkes&#x27; attitude to the campaign, saying that &quot;if Sparkes hadn&#x27;t gummed it up, then it would&#x27;ve worked&quot;. Nonetheless, Sparkes&#x27; profile continued to grow in Queensland, and he was comfortably re-elected as head of the Queensland National Party in late 1987. Bjelke-Petersen went on to state that his internal polling suggested that, had he remained in the race, he would have been very competitive.

Bjelke-Petersen was always unapologetic about his bid for federal leadership, repeatedly characterising it in his memoir as the &quot;Joh Crusade&quot;, and insisting that he &quot;did not want to be prime minister... I only wanted to go to Canberra to clean up a mess and put government there back on the right path&quot;.

==Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s downfall==
As it turned out, the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign was the last hurrah for Bjelke-Petersen and the Queensland Nationals. The campaign unnerved many, even with the Queensland National Party, with Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s actions &quot;perceived by many senior people without his party [as those] of a person who was convinced he was greater than his party&quot;.

The Fitzgerald Inquiry into corruption in Queensland began on 26 May 1987 and quickly implicated several high-ranking members of the National Party. The charges moved steadily up the ranks of the National Party and soon came to implicate Bjelke-Petersen, who was accused of systemic corruption and, later, narrowly avoided a conviction for perjury. Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s attempts to maintain his stranglehold on the National Party came to nothing, with senior ministers soon manoeuvring to remove him from office.

On 27 November 1987, the culmination of the revolt saw Bjelke-Petersen deposed as National Party leader in favour of Mike Ahern. Bjelke-Petersen tried to stay on as premier for four more days before announcing his resignation on 1 December. A Morgan Gallup poll released three days later put Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s approval rating at a record low of 22%. In less than a year, he had gone from the apex of his political success to ruin—a surprisingly rapid decline given his long dominance of Queensland politics.

The Queensland Nationals never recovered from the revelations of rampant corruption in the Bjelke-Petersen government, and were resoundingly defeated by the ALP in the 1989 state election, suffering the worst defeat of a sitting government in Queensland history up to that time.

==The appeal of Sir Joh==
Many commentators have written about Bjelke-Petersen and the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign in scathing terms. Historian Raymond Evans has claimed that it was waged &quot;somewhat like Napoleon&#x27;s ill-fated march on Moscow&quot; while Rae Wear has likened Bjelke-Petersen to Mao Zedong. Much has been made of the sense of grandeur and self-delusion that seemed to pervade Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s attempt to run for federal office, and the role that Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s personality played in shaping the campaign. Wear has cited the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign as an example of &quot;the old-age immortality project, whereby narcissistic and self-made politicians defy death by erecting lasting monuments to themselves&quot;. At the time of the campaign, Bjelke-Petersen was 75 and was eager to make a permanent mark on Australian politics before his retirement from public life.

Journalist Paul Kelly concurs, noting that hubris was an important factor in Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s campaign. He quotes Bjelke-Petersen as saying &quot;even if [the Nationals] don&#x27;t win more seats than the Liberals I&#x27;ll be prime minister&quot;, a statement that appears to confirm Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s self-delusion and ignorance of political realities. The widespread popularity that Bjelke-Petersen enjoyed in Queensland could not be transposed to the political atmosphere of federal politics.

While many historians have been damning about Bjelke-Petersen and his legacy, they have also acknowledged the appeal he held in his home state. His popularity essentially rested on a belief in Queensland exceptionalism. As premier, he cultivated his identification with the &quot;ordinary, decent Queenslander and traded on small business and rural fears of rapid social change&quot;. Queensland premiers have often gained support by emphasising &quot;rural agrarianism and mobilisation of the &#x27;common people&#x27; against a vilifed elite,&quot; a tactic that Bjelke-Petersen mastered in his nineteen years as premier. In Queensland, Bjelke-Petersen had successfully built a coalition of religious conservatives, rural voters and business interests that could be relied upon for support. However, during the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; push, he found that his appeal did not extend nationwide and that the dynamics of Queensland politics did not apply to the nation as a whole.

<doc id="553842" wikidata="Q1196556" url="?curid=553842" title="Hypertext fiction">
<text>Hypertext fiction is a genre of electronic literature characterized by the use of hypertext links that provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction. The reader typically chooses links to move from one node of text to the next, and in this fashion arranges a story from a deeper pool of potential stories. Its spirit can also be seen in interactive fiction.

The term can also be used to describe traditionally published books in which a nonlinear narrative and interactive narrative is achieved through internal references. James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), Enrique Jardiel Poncela&#x27;s &quot;La Tournée de Dios&quot; (1932), Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; (1941), Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Pale Fire&quot; (1962), Julio Cortázar&#x27;s &quot;Rayuela&quot; (1963; translated as &quot;Hopscotch&quot;), and Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Crossed Destinies&quot; (1973) are early examples predating the word &quot;hypertext&quot;, while a common pop-culture example is the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series in young adult fiction and other similar gamebooks, or Jason Shiga&#x27;s &quot;Meanwhile,&quot; a graphic novel that allows readers to choose from a total of 3,856 possible linear narratives.

In 1969, IBM and Ted Nelson from Brown University gained permission from Nabokov&#x27;s publisher to use &quot;Pale Fire&quot; as a demonstration of an early hypertext system and, in general, hypertext&#x27;s potential. The unconventional form of the demonstration was dismissed in favour of a more technically oriented variant.

== Definitions ==
There is little consensus on the definition of hypertext literature. The similar term cybertext is often used interchangeably with hypertext. In hypertext fiction, the reader assumes a significant role in the creation of the narrative. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a linear piece of literature, such as a novel, and a game. In a novel, the reader has no choice, the plot and the characters are all chosen by the author; there is no &#x27;user&#x27;, just a &#x27;reader&#x27;. This is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what actions to take, what punches to punch, or when to jump.

To Espen Aarseth, cybertext is not a genre in itself; in order to classify traditions, literary genres and aesthetic value, texts should be examined at a more local level. To Aarseth, hypertext fiction is a kind of ergodic literature:

In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.

To Aarseth, the process of reading immersive narrative, in contrast, involves &quot;trivial&quot; effort, that is, merely moving one&#x27;s eyes along lines of text and turning pages; the text does not resist the reader.

== History ==

The first hypertext fictions were published prior to the development of the World Wide Web, using software such as Storyspace and HyperCard. Noted pioneers in the field are Judy Malloy and Michael Joyce.

Early hypertext fictions published on the web include Olia Lialina&#x27;s &quot;My Boyfriend Came Back from the War&quot; (1996), which used images, words and web frames to unfold spatially in the reader&#x27;s web browser, and Adrienne Eisen&#x27;s hypertext novella &quot;Six Sex Scenes&quot; (1996), where readers moved between lexia by selecting links at the bottom of each screen. The first novel-length hypertext fiction, or hypertext novel, was Robert Arellano&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine 69&quot;, published on June 21, 1996, with navigable maps of settings, a nonlinear calendar of scenes, and a character &quot;suitcase&quot; enabling readers to try on nine different points of view. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, Mark Amerika released &quot;GRAMMATRON&quot;, a multi-linear work that was eventually exhibited in art galleries. In 2000, it was included in the Whitney Biennial of American Art.

Some other web examples of hypertext fiction include Stuart Moulthrop&#x27;s &quot;Hegirascope&quot; (1995, 1997), &quot;The Unknown&quot; (which won the trAce/Alt X award in 1998), &quot;The Company Therapist&quot; (1996–1999) (which won Net Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Entertainment Site of the Year&quot;), and Caitlin Fisher&#x27;s &quot;These Waves of Girls&quot; (2001) (which won the ELO award for fiction in 2001). More recent works include Stephen Marche&#x27;s &quot;Lucy Hardin&#x27;s Missing Period&quot; (2010) and Paul La Farge’s &quot;Luminous Airplanes&quot; (2011).

In the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works, often publishing on CD-ROM. Linda Dement’s &quot;Cyberflesh Girlmonster&quot; (1995) is a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women’s body parts and remixes them to create new shapes. Dr. Caitlin Fisher’s hypertext novella These Waves of Girls (2000), mentioned above, is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes including linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. It won the Electronic Literature Organization award.

The internationally oriented, but US based, Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) was founded in 1999 to promote the creation and enjoyment of electronic literature. Other organisations for the promotion of electronic literature include trAce Online Writing Community, a British organisation, started in 1995, that has fostered electronic literature in the UK, Dichtung Digital, a journal of criticism of electronic literature in English and German, and ELINOR, a network for electronic literature in the Nordic countries, which provides a directory of Nordic electronic literature. The Electronic Literature Directory lists many works of electronic literature in English and other languages.

== Characteristics ==
Hypertext fiction is characterized by networked nodes of text making up a fictional story. There are often several options in each node that directs where the reader can go next. Unlike traditional fiction, the reader is not constrained by reading the fiction from start to end, depending on the choices they make. In this sense, it is similar to an encyclopaedia, with the reader reading a node and then choosing a link to follow. While this can be done more easily on paper, it is quite a different experience on a screen. The reader can be thrown into unpredictable loops because not all of the links are explained by their title. The fiction can contain text, quotes, and images.

There are different forms that hypertext fiction can take. These forms are axial, arborescent, and networked. Axial hypertext fictions have a central story line with links that branch off and return to the central storyline. Arborescent fictions branch into mutually exclusive story lines, and networked fictions have multiple starting points and do not always have a set ending. A single work of hypertext fiction can have a mixture of these three forms.

== Criticism ==
In 2013, Steven Johnson, founder of the online magazine FEED, an early publisher of hypertext fiction, wrote an article for &quot;Wired&quot; detailing why hypertext fiction did not become popular, claiming that non-linear stories are difficult to write, since each section of the work would need to introduce characters or concepts.

== Legacy ==
Twine fictions have often been cited as being a direct descendant of hypertext fiction.

<doc id="553845" wikidata="Q73714" url="?curid=553845" title="Velvet-fronted nuthatch">
<text>The velvet-fronted nuthatch (Sitta frontalis) is a small passerine bird in the nuthatch family Sittidae found in southern Asia from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka ‍and Bangladesh east to south China and Indonesia. Like other nuthatches, it feeds on insects in the bark of trees, foraging on the trunks and branches and their strongly clawed toes allow them to climb down tree trunks or move on the undersides of horizontal branches. They are found in forests with good tree cover and are often found along with other species in mixed-species foraging flocks. Adult males can be told apart by the black stripe that runs behind and above the eyes. They have a rapid chipping call note. They breed in tree cavities and holes, often created by woodpeckers or barbets.

== Description ==
The velvet-fronted nuthatch has the typical nuthatch shape, short tail and powerful bill and feet. It is 12.5 cm long. It is violet-blue above, with lavender cheeks, beige underparts, yellow eyes, and a whitish throat. The iris is distinctly pale and yellow. The bill is red, and there is a black patch on the forehead and lores which is well developed in adults and less so in younger birds. Young birds have a dark beak and dark tips to the undertail coverts. Adult males can be told apart by the black superciliary stripe that runs above the eye and over the head, towards the nape.

Females lack the supercilium and have a warmer underpart colour. Juveniles are duller versions of the adult lacking the black frontal band. There populations differ in shade and size and the distribution of white on the throat.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

Velvet-fronted nuthatches are closely related to &quot;Sitta solangiae&quot;, &quot;Sitta azurea&quot; and &quot;Sitta oenochlamys&quot; and some authors have placed them in a separate genus &quot;Oenositta&quot; (proposed by H.E. Wolters in 1979) which would be inappropriate as the clade, although distinct in morphology, is nested within other &quot;Sitta&quot; species. The complex includes numerous forms which have had a confusing history, for instance &quot;oenochlamys&quot; has been treated as a subspecies of &quot;frontalis&quot; in the past. The species was first described validly by Swainson who also created the genus &quot;Dendrophila&quot; in which he initially placed the species. Hodgson had however used the name &quot;Dendrophila&quot; for a species of partridge. Swainson used the species name given by Horsfield who had named the bird as &quot;Orthorynchus frontalis&quot; but Horsfield published only in 1821 giving priority to Swainson as the author.

About five populations are widely recognized as subspecies but some may be treated as phylogenetic species:

*&quot;S. f. frontalis&quot; - the nominate form is from the hill forests of southern India, they occur in the Western Ghats, the Eastern Ghats, the central Indian forests and in Sri Lanka. The population along the Himalayas is also included in this although the name &quot;corallina&quot; might be more appropriate for this population with individuals being slightly smaller (contrary to Bergmann&#x27;s rule). The name &quot;simplex&quot; proposed by Koelz in 1939 for birds from the south of Bombay is considered as a synonym. The Himalayan population extends from Uttarakhand east to Bangladesh and into Thailand, Myanmar, the Isthmus of Kra and possibly into Hong Kong where it may be an introduced species. The name &quot;chienfengensis&quot; was proposed by Tso-Hsin Cheng, 1964 for the birds of Hainan, China.
*&quot;S. f. saturatior&quot; – this is distributed in the Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra which includes Penang, Singapore, the, Lingga Archipelago and Sumatra.
*&quot;S. f. corallipes&quot; – is found in Borneo extending into the Maratua Island
*&quot;S. f. palawana&quot; – Palawan and Balabac in the western Philippines.
*&quot;S. f. velata&quot; – Java.

The use of ectoparasites such as &quot;Brueelia&quot; as a proxy to unravel the phylogeny of the species is unreliable as the nuthatch shares the same &quot;Brueelia&quot; species with flycatchers (&quot;Rhipidura&quot; and &quot;Ficedula&quot;), possibly because these parasites are phoretic, travelling across hosts via blowflies.

== Habitat and ecology ==

The velvet-fronted nuthatch is a resident breeder of all types of forests from deciduous to evergreen forest. In the Sunderbans, they are found in &quot;Sonneratia&quot; mangrove forests. They also live within secondary forest and make use of the shade trees in south Indian coffee plantations.

Like other nuthatches they have strongly curved claws that allow them to climb down vertical tree trunks, unlike species such as woodpeckers that only work their way upwards. It moves jerkily up and down or around tree branches and trunks. It is an active feeder on insects and spiders, gleaned on the bark of the trunk and branches, and may be found in mixed feeding flocks with other passerines. The insects they disturb are sometimes taken by the racket-tailed drongo in Sri Lanka.

This is a noisy bird, often located by its repeated “sit-sit-sit” call.

Adults go through a complete postnuptial moult that begins at the end of June in northern India.

&quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites including &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; have been detected in their blood. Feather mites of the genus &quot;Neodectes&quot; are found on the species.

==Breeding==
Nests are in tree holes or crevices, lined with moss, fur and feathers, or grass. The breeding season on northern India is in summer, April to June and January to May in southern India and Sri Lanka. Unlike other nuthatches, it is said not to employ mud to narrow the entrance of the hole. Three to six eggs are laid, white speckled with red. The female spends more time incubating but both take turns in feeding the young.

== In culture ==
Being a small forest bird, only a few forest-dwelling tribes are aware of the species. The Lotha Naga people will hunt many birds for food but the velvet-fronted nuthatch is generally proscribed due to the belief that killing them would bring misfortune to the hunter. The birds forage in flocks and members are believed to stay on nearby if one is killed, and according to the Lothas, they will wait to be killed and the hunter would soon see people around him die in quick succession one after another. The Soliga people call it the maratotta or &quot;tree hopper&quot;.

<text>Jorge Castañeda Gutman (born May 24, 1953) is a Mexican politician and academic who served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs (2000–2003).

He also authored more than a dozen books, including a biography of Che Guevara, and he regularly contributes to newspapers such as &quot;Reforma&quot; (Mexico), &quot;El País&quot; (Spain), &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (USA) and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2008.

== Early life and education ==
Castañeda was born in Mexico City. His father was Jorge Castañeda y Álvarez de la Rosa who served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1979–1982), during the administration of José López Portillo.

He received the French Baccalauréat from the Lycée Franco-Mexicain in Mexico City. He graduated with an AB in history from Princeton University in 1973 after completing a 241-page long senior thesis titled &quot;The Movement of the Revolutionary Left in Chile: 1965-1972.&quot; Then after receiving his PhD in Economic History from the University of Paris (Panthéon-La Sorbonne) he worked as a professor at several universities, including the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the University of California, Berkeley, Princeton University, New York University, and the University of Cambridge. He was a Bernard Schwartz fellow at The New America Foundation.

He was married to Miriam Morales (a Chilean citizen) and he has one son, Jorge Andrés.

== Academic books ==
Among his books is &quot;Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left After the Cold War&quot; (Vintage Books, 1993), an assessment of leftist politics in Latin America. The book has had a wide readership for its sometimes controversial overview of left-leaning politics in the region post-1990. Its main theme is a shift from politics based on the Cuban Revolution to politics based on broad-based new social movements, from armed revolutions to elections.

Another of Castañeda&#x27;s well-known works is &quot;Compañero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara&quot;, which analyzes the Argentine Marxist revolutionary.

== Political career ==
Castañeda&#x27;s political career began as a member of the Mexican Communist Party but he has since moved to the political center. He served as an advisor to Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas during his (failed) presidential campaign in 1988 and advised Vicente Fox during his (successful) presidential campaign in 2000.

After winning the election, Fox appointed Castañeda as his Secretary of Foreign Affairs.

Following a number of disagreements with other cabinet members Castañeda left the post in January 2003 and began traveling around the country, giving lectures and promoting his ideas. In July 2003, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed him to the United Nations Commission on the Private Sector and Development, which was co-chaired by Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada and former President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.

===Presidential candidacy===
On March 25, 2004, Castañeda officially announced his presidential campaign by means of a prime-time campaign advertisement carried in all major Mexican television stations. He presented himself as an independent &quot;citizens&#x27; candidate&quot;, a move contrary to Mexico&#x27;s electoral law that gives registered parties alone the right to nominate candidates for election.

In 2004, Castañeda started to seek Court authorization to run in the country&#x27;s 2006 presidential election without the endorsement of any of the registered political parties. In August 2005 the Supreme Court ruled against Castañeda&#x27;s appeal. The ruling essentially put an end to Castañeda&#x27;s bid to run as an independent candidate; however, soon after this ruling he took his case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in order to defend his political rights; in 2008 the IACHR found that the State violated the American Convention on Human Rights and ordered major electoral reform in the country.

===Later career===
In 2014, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Castañeda as co-chair of a commission of inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in the Central African Republic, alongside Fatimata M&#x27;Baye and Bernard Acho Muna; within two months, however, Castañeda resigned from the position.

== Articles ==
He has published articles in &quot;Newsweek&quot; and writes regularly for &quot;Project Syndicate&quot;.

In a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article published in March 2009, he suggested that Hugo Chávez was plotting a coup in Cuba due to concerns that Raul Castro would make concessions that would betray the Cuban Revolution. According to his thesis, Hugo Chávez asked Leonel Fernández of the Dominican Republic to support the plot, but he declined. Castañeda&#x27;s statements were met with scepticism from politicians and scholars. He has admitted that he has no proof, calling his thesis &quot;informed speculation&quot;.

<text>Vinko Bogataj () is a Slovenian painter and former ski jumper. Footage of him crashing featured on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; represented the Agony of Defeat.

==&quot;Agony of Defeat&quot; jump==
Bogataj competed as a Yugoslav entrant at the ski flying event in Oberstdorf, West Germany on 7 March 1970. A light snow had begun falling at the start of the competition, and by the time Bogataj was ready for his third jump on the Heini Klopfer hill, the snow had become quite heavy. Midway down the inrun for his jump, Bogataj realised that the conditions had made the ramp too fast. He attempted to lower his center of gravity and slow his jump, but instead lost his balance completely and hurtled out of control off the end of the inrun, tumbling and flipping wildly, and crashing through a light retaining fence near a crowd of spectators before coming to a halt. Bogataj suffered a mild concussion and a broken ankle.

A film crew from &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; was recording the event in which Bogataj crashed. The show featured an opening narration by host Jim McKay over a montage of sports clips, and co-ordinating producer Dennis Lewin inserted the footage of the crash to coincide with the words &quot;...and the agony of defeat.&quot; Throughout the show&#x27;s long history, various images were used for the other parts of the narration, including for &quot;the thrill of victory...&quot;, which directly preceded the above phrase and was often accompanied by images of the celebrating team at the most recent Super Bowl or World Cup, but after that point, the &quot;agony of defeat&quot; was always illustrated by Bogataj&#x27;s failed jump. Later on, other clips were added to the &quot;agony of defeat&quot;, but Bogataj&#x27;s crash was always featured and always the first played.

The melodrama of the narration—which became a catchphrase in the US—transformed the uncredited ski jumper into an American icon of bad luck and misfortune. Meanwhile, having retired to his quiet, private life in Slovenia, Bogataj was unaware of his celebrity, and so was surprised to be asked to attend the 20th anniversary celebration for &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; in 1981. He received the loudest ovation of any athlete introduced at the gala, and attendees such as Muhammad Ali asked him for his autograph.

In the 1990s, while on his way to an interview with &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; about the incident, he got into a small automobile collision. His first line to the reporter was &quot;every time I&#x27;m on ABC, I crash.&quot;

==Later life==
Bogataj returned to ski jumping in 1971 but never duplicated the success he had before the crash and retired from the sport competitively, save for occasional senior competitions thereafter. During his career, his best career finish was 57th in the individual normal hill competition in Bischofshofen in 1969 during that year&#x27;s Four Hills Tournament.

Bogataj became a ski instructor, coaching the 1991 World Champion Slovenian ski jumper Franci Petek. He supplements his income by painting and has also worked as a forklift operator at a factory, Veriga Lesce. His paintings have won awards and been exhibited in both Europe and the U.S. He also enjoys wood carving.

Bogataj resides in his hometown of Lesce, Slovenia. He is married and has two daughters.

<text>The Himalayan black-lored tit (Machlolophus xanthogenys), also known as simply black-lored tit, is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. The yellow-cheeked tit is probably its closest relative, and it may also be related to the yellow tit. These three tits almost certainly form a distinct lineage, as indicated by morphology, and mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence analysis (Gill &quot;et al.&quot;, 2005).

&quot;Lore&quot; in the bird&#x27;s common name refers to the area between eye and bill.

This species is a resident breeder along the Himalayas in the Indian Subcontinent including Nepal.In Nepali, it is known as &quot;Pandu Chichilkote&quot;.

It is an active and agile feeder, taking insects and spiders from the forest canopy, and sometimes fruit.

It uses woodpecker or barbet holes for nesting, and will also excavate its own hole or use man-made sites.

The Himalayan black-lored tit was formerly one of the many species in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; but was moved to &quot;Machlolophus&quot; after a molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 showed that the members of the new genus formed a distinct clade.

<text>Robert Gray Gallager (born May 29, 1931) is an American electrical engineer known for his work on information theory and communications networks.

Gallager was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1979 for contributions to coding and communications theory and practice. He was also elected an IEEE Fellow in 1968, a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1992, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) in 1999.

He received the Claude E. Shannon Award from the IEEE Information Theory Society in 1983. He also received the IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984, the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1990 &quot;For fundamental contributions to communications coding techniques&quot;, the Marconi Prize in 2003, and a
Dijkstra Prize in 2004, among other honors. For most of his career he was a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Biography==
Gallager received the B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953. He was a member of the technical staff at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1953–1954 and then served in the U.S. Signal Corps 1954–1956. He returned to graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and received the S.M. degree in 1957 and Sc.D. in 1960 in electrical engineering. He has been a faculty member at MIT since 1960 where he was co-director of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems from 1986 to 1998, was named Fujitsu Professor in 1988, and became Professor Emeritus in 2001. He was a visiting associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965 and a visiting professor at the École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications, Paris, in 1978.

Gallager&#x27;s 1960 Sc.D. thesis, on low-density parity-check codes, was published by the MIT Press as a monograph in 1963.
The codes, which remained useful over 50 years, are sometimes called &quot;Gallager codes&quot;. An abbreviated version appeared in January 1962 in the IRE &quot;Transactions on Information Theory&quot; and was republished in the 1974 IEEE Press volume, &quot;Key Papers in The Development of Information Theory&quot;, edited by Elwyn Berlekamp. This paper won an IEEE Information Theory Society Golden-Jubilee Paper Award in 1998 and its subject matter is a very active area of research today. Gallager&#x27;s January 1965 paper in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, &quot;A Simple Derivation of the Coding Theorem and some Applications&quot;, won the 1966 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Award &quot;for the most outstanding paper, reporting original work, in the Transactions, Journals and Magazines of the IEEE Societies, or in the Proceedings of the IEEE&quot; and also won another IEEE Information Theory Society Golden-Jubilee Paper Award in 1998. His book, &quot;Information Theory and Reliable Communication,&quot; Wiley 1968, placed Information Theory on a sound mathematical foundation and is still considered by many as the standard textbook on information theory.

Gallager consulted for Melpar as a graduate student, and for Codex Corporation when it was founded in 1962. He served Codex as acting vice president for research in 1971–1972. His work (along with fellow-MIT faculty member Dave Forney) on quadrature amplitude modulation led to the 9600 bit/s modems that provided Codex&#x27;s commercial success. He has also consulted for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and a number of other companies. He has been granted five patents on his inventions.

In the mid-1970s, Gallager&#x27;s research focus shifted to data networks, focusing on distributed algorithms, routing, congestion control, and random access techniques. In 1978, he showed, with graduate student Roger Camrass, that packet switching was optimal in the Huffman coding sense. He published a book &quot;Data Networks&quot; in 1988, with a second edition 1992, co-authored with Dimitri Bertsekas, which helped provide a conceptual foundation for this field.

In the 1990s, Gallager&#x27;s interests shifted back to information theory and to stochastic processes. He wrote the 1996 textbook, &quot;Discrete Stochastic Processes&quot;. Gallager&#x27;s current interests are in information theory, wireless communication, all optical networks, data networks, and stochastic processes.

Over the years, Gallager has taught and mentored many graduate students, many of whom are now themselves leading researchers in their fields. He received the MIT Graduate Student Council Teaching Award for 1993. In 1999 he received the Harvey Prize from the American Society for the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. In 2020 he was awarded the Japan Prize.

Gallager&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Principles of Digital Communication&quot; was published by Cambridge University Press in 2008.

Gallager was President of the IEEE Information Theory Society in 1971, a member of its board of governors from 1965 to 1972 and again from 1979 to 1988. He served the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory as associate editor for coding 1963–1964 and as associate editor for computer communications from 1977 to 1980. He was chairman of the advisory committee to the National Science Foundation Division on Networking and Communication Research and Infrastructure from 1989 to 1992, and has been on numerous visiting committees for electrical engineering and computer science departments.

==Personal life==
Gallager has 3 children, 4 stepchildren, 7 grandchildren, 10 step grandchildren and 3 great step children. He is married to Marie Gallager.

<text>Blue Beetle is the name of three superheroes appearing in a number of American comic books published by a variety of companies since 1939. The most recent of the companies to own rights to Blue Beetle is DC Comics, which bought the rights to the character in 1983, using the name for three distinct characters over the years.

The original Blue Beetle was created by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski and Fox Comics and later owned by Charlton Comics. The first Beetle was Dan Garret (later spelled Dan Garrett), who initially gained superpowers from a special vitamin, which was later changed to gaining powers from a &quot;sacred scarab&quot;. The original Blue Beetle was featured in not only his own comic but also a weekly radio serial.

The second Blue Beetle, created by Charlton and later taken over by DC Comics, was the successor to Dan Garrett known as Ted Kord. Kord &quot;jumped&quot; to the DC Comics universe during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; alongside a number of other Charlton Comics characters. The second Blue Beetle later starred in his own 24-issue comic. Kord never had any super powers but used science to create various devices to help him fight crime. He became a member of the Justice League of America and was later killed during the prelude to DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; cross over.

The third Blue Beetle, created by DC Comics, is Jaime Reyes, a teenager who discovers that the original Blue Beetle scarab morphs into a battle suit allowing him to fight crime and travel in space. Over the years, Reyes became a member of the Teen Titans and starred in two Blue Beetle comic series. In DC Comics&#x27; 2011 &quot;New 52&quot; reboot, Jaime Reyes was the primary Blue Beetle character, only occasionally referring to past versions. With the subsequent continuity revision &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, the previous versions were restored.

==Publication history==

The original Blue Beetle, Dan Garret, first appeared in Fox Comics&#x27; &quot;Mystery Men Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski (as Charles Nicholas), though the Grand Comics Database tentatively credits Will Eisner as the scripter. A rookie police officer, he wore a special bulletproof costume and took &quot;Vitamin 2X&quot; which endowed him with super-energy, and he was assisted by a neighborhood pharmacist in his fight against crime. Blue Beetle starred in a comic book series, comic strip and radio serial, but like most Golden Age superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through Holyoke Publishing; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied throughout the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950.

In the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold the printing plates for some stories featuring the Blue Beetle to Charlton Comics. Reprinted stories from the original &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series were initially published in Charlton&#x27;s anthology comic &quot;Space Adventures&quot; #13-14 (Oct. 1954, Jan. 1955). Charlton Comics then began publishing their own &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series, taking over numbering from the horror anthology series &quot;The Thing!&quot;, beginning with issue #18 (Feb. 1955). Issues #18-19 consisted entirely of reprinted Fox Comics stories; #20-21 included new adventures of the Golden Age character. The series was cancelled after these four issues, with numbering taken over from #22 onwards by &quot;Mr. Muscles&quot;. One more original story starring the Golden Age incarnation of the character was published as a backup feature in &quot;Nature Boy&quot; #3 (Mar. 1956).

In 1964, Charlton Comics began publishing a new series of &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; which substantially revamped the hero, reinventing him as a university professor and altering the spelling of his name to Dan Garrett. The first issue (Jun. 1964) was a new origin story that depicted Dan Garrett coming into possession of a mystical Egyptian scarab that granted him superpowers and beginning his career as the Blue Beetle. After five issues were published, the next issue was numbered as #50 (Jul. 1965), taking over numbering from the anthology comic &quot;Unusual Tales&quot;. The series ended with issue #54 (Feb.-Mar. 1966), its numbering taken over afterwards by the anthology comic &quot;Ghostly Tales&quot;. Issues #1-5 and #50-53 were written by Joe Gill and issue #54 by Roy Thomas; art for all ten issues was by Bill Fraccio and Tony Tallarico.

Later in 1966, Blue Beetle was reinvented again in a set of backup stories published in &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #83 (Nov. 1966) through #86, plotted and drawn by Steve Ditko: they introduced Ted Kord, a student of Dan Garrett&#x27;s, who took on the role of Blue Beetle following Garrett&#x27;s apparent death. Kord was an inventor hero, using a variety of gadgets, with a day job of running his own research lab. This Beetle received his own series in 1967, also by Ditko, which ran for five issues until the entire Charlton &quot;Action Heroes&quot; line of comic books ceased publication in 1968. The story planned for a sixth issue was eventually printed, without coloring, in the fan publication &quot;Charlton Portfolio&quot; #1 in 1974.

Both Blue Beetles reappeared in the third issue of &quot;Americomics&quot;, a title published by AC Comics in 1983–84. In the first story in this issue, Ted Kord fought a bogus Dan Garrett, but the second story was more significant. It revealed that the original 1940s Dan was reincarnated as the Silver Age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified &quot;gods&quot;, presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrected Dan again and sent him off to save Ted Kord&#x27;s life (leaving him a note saying simply, &quot;Try not to get killed this time&quot;). After this adventure, Kord turned the Blue Beetle name back over to Dan. &quot;Americomics&quot; was canceled after issue #6, and so far this story has never been referenced by any other publisher.

With the rest of the Charlton Comics superhero line-up, Blue Beetle was sold to DC Comics in 1983. A new &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series starring Ted Kord began publication in 1986, integrating the hero into the DC Comics shared universe. The series ran for 24 issues (Jun. 1986-May 1988), all written by Len Wein. While the series largely carried over the status quo and characters from Charlton Comics, some new elements were introduced: most notably, Ted Kord was made a billionaire industrialist as his research lab was reinvented as the massively successful R &amp; D company Kord Industries.

Blue Beetle became a member of the Justice League upon the launch of a new series in 1987, beginning with &quot;Justice League&quot; #1 (May 1987). Depicted with a more comedic tone than in the &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; solo comic, Ted Kord became best friends with team-mate Booster Gold. Blue Beetle remained as a main character on the series as it was re-titled &quot;Justice League International&quot; and then &quot;Justice League America&quot;. Following the event miniseries &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, both Blue Beetle and Booster Gold left the series and began starring in the new team title &quot;Extreme Justice&quot;, which ran for issues #0-18 (Jan. 1995-Jul. 1996). Ted Kord later became a recurring character in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, and starred in the 2003-04 miniseries &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot;. The character of Ted Kord was killed off in the one-shot comic &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot; (May 2005).

In 2006, DC introduced a new Blue Beetle, teenager Jaime Reyes, whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed as a piece of advanced alien technology. A new ongoing &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series began publication in March 2006, initially written by Keith Giffen and John Rogers, with artist Cully Hamner. Giffen left in issue #10 and Rogers took over full writing duties, joined by a new artist, Rafael Albuquerque. Rogers left the title with issue #25 to concentrate on his television series &quot;Leverage&quot;. After three fill-in issues, Lilah Sturges became the main writer in issue #29, but the series was cancelled with issue #36. Editor Dan DiDio put the cancellation down to poor sales and said that &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; was &quot;a book that we started with very high expectations, but it lost its audience along the way&quot;.

All three incarnations of &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; were depicted in &quot;Booster Gold&quot; (vol. 2) #6. Following the cancellation of Jaime Reyes&#x27; solo series, the character was brought back to star in a backup feature in &quot;Booster Gold&quot;, once again written by Sturges. The backup feature ran through issues #21-25 (Aug.-Dec. 2009) and #28-29 (Mar.-Apr. 2010).

A new &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; comic was launched as part of The New 52 initiative in September 2011, with Jaime Reyes&#x27; history being rebooted with a new origin and without any apparent history of Kord or Garrett as prior Blue Beetles. The new book was written by Tony Bedard and drawn by Ig Guara. &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; was cancelled after issue #16 (Mar. 2013); Jaime Reyes&#x27;s story was then continued in the new title &quot;Threshold&quot;, written by Keith Giffen, which ultimately ran for eight issues (Mar.-Oct. 2013).

The 2016 publishing initiative DC Rebirth restored the history of Dan Garrett and Ted Kord as previous Blue Beetles. A new &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series was launched that year, with a one-shot special &quot;Blue Beetle: Rebirth&quot; (Oct. 2016) preceding &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; #1 vol. 9 (Nov. 2016), once again written by Keith Giffen. The series starred Jaime Reyes, while also featuring Ted Kord as an ex-superhero who acts as his mentor. The series ran until issue #18 (Apr. 2018). Ted Kord then co-starred alongside Booster Gold in the 2021-22 limited series &quot;Blue &amp; Gold&quot; by Dan Jurgens, once again operating as a superhero under the name Blue Beetle. 

Jaime Reyes remains the primary Blue Beetle for DC Comics. The 2022-23 limited series &quot;Blue Beetle: Graduation Day&quot;, written by Josh Trujillo and illustrated by Adrián Gutiérrez, featured Jaime Reyes as the main character. This was followed by a new ongoing &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; series by the same creative team, beginning in September 2023.

==Characters==
===Dan Garret / Dan Garrett===

The original Golden Age Blue Beetle is Dan Garret, son of a police officer killed by a criminal. This Fox Feature Syndicate version of the character debuted in &quot;Mystery Men Comics&quot; #1 (August 1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter. Fox Feature Syndicate sponsored a &quot;Blue Beetle Day&quot; at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair on August 7, 1940, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and including 300 children in relay-race finals at the Field of Special Events, following preliminaries in New York City parks. The race was broadcast over radio station WMCA.

Charlton Comics reprinted some stories in its anthology titles and in a four-issue &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; reprint series numbered 18–21, although there is no evidence that they obtained the rights to the character - just that they purchased the printing plates to earlier stories.

In 1964, during the Silver Age of comics, Charlton revised the character for a new Blue Beetle series. Charlton&#x27;s new Blue Beetle retained the original&#x27;s name (adding a second &quot;t&quot;), but none of his powers or origin, making him a different character. This Beetle was archaeologist Dan Garrett, who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including super strength and vision, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts) from a mystical scarab he found during a dig in Egypt, where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh. He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words &quot;Kaji Dha!&quot; This version, by writer Joe Gill and artist Tony Tallarico, was played at least initially for camp, with stories like &quot;The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead&quot;. The Charlton Dan Garrett version of the Blue Beetle ran only until 1966 before his replacement debuted.

The Charlton version of Dan Garrett was spotlighted in the second issue of DC&#x27;s 1980s &quot;Secret Origins&quot; series, in which his origin was retold along with that of Ted Kord. Subsequent appearances by Dan Garrett (in flashback stories) include guest spots or cameos in &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Captain Atom&quot;, &quot;JLA: Year One&quot;, and &quot;Legends of the DC Universe&quot;.

The character briefly returned in DC Comics&#x27; first run of &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;, resurrected by his mystical scarab to battle against his successor. He can also be seen in various flashback stories. His 1940s incarnation is briefly glimpsed in DC&#x27;s 1993 limited series &quot;The Golden Age&quot;.

In issue #0 of the &quot;Project Superpowers&quot; miniseries, the Fox Feature Syndicate version of the Blue Beetle appeared in flashbacks (as by now the character/spelling &quot;Dan Garret&quot; was in the public domain). To avoid trademark conflicts with DC Comics, he is referred to in this series by the nickname &quot;Big Blue&quot;.

===Ted Kord===

The replacement Blue Beetle created by Charlton Comics, and later published by Americomics and DC Comics, is Ted Kord, a former student of Dan Garrett, a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete. Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord&#x27;s Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.

Ted had the scarab for some time, but never used it. He carried it during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; when he was chosen by the Monitor to protect the multiple Earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; it did not give him superpowers.

During the &quot;Death of Superman&quot; saga, the Blue Beetle and the other JLA members tried to stop Doomsday&#x27;s path of destruction. Doomsday displayed his near-invulnerability and, while brutally defeating the League, put the Blue Beetle into a coma. Upon recovery, he continued his tenure with the JLA as well as its offshoot, Extreme Justice.

Blue Beetle discovered a renewed Checkmate organization led by Maxwell Lord, with a database containing information on every metahuman on Earth. He was captured and executed with a single gunshot to the head. Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact Captain Marvel, but was forced to leave it with the wizard Shazam in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to Earth.

Some time later, Booster Gold, along with Jaime, Dan, and the Black Beetle in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death.

===Jaime Reyes===

Jaime Reyes is a teenager who lives in El Paso, Texas, with his father, mother, and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down. He feels Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can, and should attempt to further his education. He finds the scarab in a vacant lot and it fuses with him while he sleeps. After Booster Gold revealed Jaime&#x27;s new powers to him, Jaime was swept up in the climactic battle with Brother Eye during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. He later becomes a member of the Teen Titans, and is good friends with Rose Wilson (Ravager), Robin, Static, and others. In &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #83, he takes a break from the team to be with his mother.

Jaime has a girlfriend, the young sorceress Traci 13, who gets along well with Jaime&#x27;s family. His large and loving family is a major source of strength and guidance for Jaime. Christopher Smith aka the Peacemaker also became a mentor for the young Blue Beetle.

Jaime co-starred along with the rest of the former Justice League International in &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;.

Following DC&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; was one of 52 monthly titles launched in September 2011, again starring Jaime Reyes. The series was cancelled after 17 issues in January 2013.

==The Scarab – Khaji Da==
The Blue Beetle scarab, previously shown as an artifact of magic, is later retconned as a tool of war of the Reach, an ancient race of cosmic marauders. After being defeated by the Guardians of the Universe thousands of years ago and forced into a truce, the Reach poses as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations. The scarab is a gift for that world&#x27;s champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect their peers. Secretly, the scarab is part of an advanced hive mind, with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting the wearer&#x27;s own. The wearer is turned into the &quot;ultimate infiltrator&quot;, a covert agent intended to take over its own world. However, the Blue Beetle Scarab is damaged and so instead of it controlling the host, it forms a symbiotic relationship with them.

The Blue Beetle scarab uses its serial number, Khaji Da, as its name.

In the New 52, the Reach forgoes the secrecy, and each wearer immediately becomes possessed by the scarab. It then uses its host&#x27;s knowledge to decimate the world and prepare it for a full invasion by Reach forces.

In &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth&quot;, Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes believe the scarab is an alien device that bonded to Jaime&#x27;s spine. Kord is fascinated by this scarab and wants to investigate the potential of it while Jaime fears it. When Jaime leaves Kord&#x27;s lab to get to school, Dr. Fate appears in the lab to warn Kord that the scarab is not an alien device, but it is instead magic. This further sparks Kord&#x27;s interest in the potential of the scarab.

==Enemies==
The Blue Beetle faces many enemies throughout his storylines, beginning with The White Face Gang in &quot;Mystery Men #1 (August 1939).&quot; As Ted Kord, he later faces several notable enemies, including Doctor Alchemy (&quot;Showcase&quot; #13), Chronos (&quot;The Atom&quot; #3), his uncle Jarvis Kord (&quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 5 #2), Enigma (&quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot; vol. 2 #1), Carapax the Indestructible Man (&quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 6 #1), Hybrid (&quot;New Teen Titans&quot; vol. 2 #24), Maxwell Lord (&quot;Justice League&quot; #1), and Overthrow (&quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 6 #15). As Jamie Reyes, the Blue Beetle takes on La Dama as an archenemy, beginning in &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 7 #3. They also oppose Typhoon (&quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 7 #17), Black Beetle (&quot;Booster Gold&quot; vol. 2 #5), and Doctor Polaris (&quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 2 #17).

<text>The Government of India (ISO: Bhārata Sarakāra, legally the Union Government or Union of India and colloquially known as the Central Government) is the national authority of the Republic of India, located in South Asia, consisting of 36 states and union territories. The government is led by the president of India (currently ) who exercises the most executive power and selects the prime minister of India and other ministers for aid and advice. The country is being legislated by a The prime minister and their senior ministers belong to the Union Council of Ministers—its executive decision-making committee being the cabinet.

The government, seated in New Delhi, has three primary branches: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary, whose powers are vested in bicameral Parliament of India, Union Council of Ministers (headed by prime minister), and the Supreme Court of India respectively, with a president as head of state.

The Union Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lower House of parliament. As is the case in most parliamentary systems, the government is dependent on Parliament to legislate, and general elections are held every five years to elect a new Lok Sabha. The most recent election was in 2024.

After an election, the president generally selects as Prime Minister the leader of the party or alliance most likely to command the confidence of the majority of the Lok Sabha. In the event that the prime minister is not a member of either House of Parliament upon appointment, he/she is given six months to be elected or appointed to either House of Parliament.

==History==

=== British colonial rule: (1857–1947) ===

The first seeds of responsible government during British colonial rule in India were sown by the Indian Councils Act 1909, commonly known as the Morley-Minto reforms. The Act introduced elections to the Imperial Legislative Council (then the unicameral Legislature for British India). Before that, governance was carried by an all-European Legislative Council and Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council. As such, no Indians were represented in government before 1909.

India&#x27;s current bicameral Parliament has its roots in the Government of India Act 1919, commonly known as the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, which introduced a greatly expanded Imperial Legislative Council. It comprised a lower house, the Central Legislative Assembly of 145 members (of which 104 were elected and 41 nominated) and an upper house, the Council of State of 60 members (of which 34 were elected and 26 nominated).

The next structural modification to the governance of British India, the Government of India Act 1935 (the longest Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom until surpassed by the Greater London Authority Act 1999) was aimed at devolution of powers by establishing provincial governments and the creation of civil service institutions. However, it was unpopular amongst Indians and is considered a failure as it did not give Indians self-rule and permanent dominion status (the form of government followed in Canada, Australia and New Zealand) as was previously promised.

=== Dominion: (1947–1950) ===
Between midnight on 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, India was an independent, self-governing dominion of the Commonwealth of Nations, a constitutional monarchy with a Prime Minister and a Governor-General as the viceregal representative of the head of state, George VI. Its unicameral legislature, the Constituent Assembly, was tasked with drafting the country&#x27;s constitution.

=== Republic: (1950–present) ===
The Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950, making India a republic with a president as head of state, replacing the monarch and his viceregal representative, the governor-general. It was based in large part on the Government of India Act 1935, which was itself based on the uncodified constitution of the United Kingdom. It also drew notable inspirations from the constitutions of several other Commonwealth dominions and the French, Soviet, Japanese, German and American constitutions.

India today prides itself in being the world&#x27;s largest democracy, and the 4th largest economy in the world. Even though much remains to be done, especially in regard to eradicating poverty and securing effective structures of governance, India&#x27;s achievements since independence in sustaining freedom and democracy have been singular among the world&#x27;s new nations.

== Basic structure ==
The Government of India is modelled after the Westminster system. The Union government is mainly composed of the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary, and powers are vested by the constitution in the council of ministers, parliament, and the supreme court, respectively. The president of India is the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces, while the elected prime minister acts as the head of the executive and is responsible for running the Union government. Parliament is bicameral in nature, with the Lok Sabha being the lower house, and the Rajya Sabha the upper house. The judiciary systematically contains an apex supreme court, 25 high courts, and hundreds of district courts, all subordinate to the supreme court.

The basic civil and criminal laws governing the citizens of India are set down in major parliamentary legislation, such as the civil procedure code, the penal code, and the criminal procedure code. Similar to the Union government, individual state governments each consist of executive, legislative and judiciary branches. The legal system as applicable to the Union and individual state governments is based on the English common and Statutory Law. The full name of the country is the &quot;Republic of India&quot;. India and Bharat are equally official short names for the Republic of India in the Constitution, and both names appears on legal banknotes, in treaties and in legal cases. The terms &quot;Union government&quot;, &quot;central government&quot; and &quot;&quot; are often used officially and unofficially to refer to the government of India. The term &quot;New Delhi&quot; is commonly used as a metonym for the Union government, as the seat of the central government is in New Delhi.

== Legislature ==
The powers of the legislature in India are exercised by the Parliament, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. Of the two houses of parliament, the Rajya Sabha (or the &#x27;Council of States&#x27;) is considered to be the upper house and consists of members appointed by the president and elected by the state and territorial legislatures. The Lok Sabha (or the &#x27;House of the People&#x27;) is considered the lower house.

The parliament does not have complete control and sovereignty, as its laws are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court. However, it does exercise some control over the executive. The members of the Council of Ministers, including the prime minister, are either chosen from parliament or elected there within six months of assuming office. The council as a whole is responsible to the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha is a temporary house and can be dissolved only when the party in power loses the support of the majority of the house. The Rajya Sabha is a permanent house and can never be dissolved. The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected for a six-year term.

== Executive ==
The executive of government is the one that has sole authority and responsibility for the daily administration of the state bureaucracy. The division of power into separate branches of government is central to the republican idea of the separation of powers.

=== President ===

The executive power is vested mainly in the president of India, as per Article 53(1) of the constitution. The president has all constitutional powers and exercises them directly or through subordinate officers as per the aforesaid Article 53(1). The president is to act following aid and advice tendered by the prime minister, who leads the Council of Ministers as described in Article 74 of the Constitution.

The council of ministers remains in power during the &#x27;pleasure&#x27; of the president. However, in practice, the council of ministers must retain the support of the Lok Sabha. If a president were to dismiss the council of ministers on his or her initiative, it might trigger a constitutional crisis. Thus, in practice, the Council of Ministers cannot be dismissed as long as it holds the support of a majority in the Lok Sabha.

The president is responsible for appointing many high officials in India. These high officials include the governors of the 28 states; the chief justice; other judges of the supreme court and high courts on the advice of other judges; the attorney general; the comptroller and auditor general; the chief election commissioner and other election commissioners; the chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission; the officers of the All India Services (IAS, IFoS and IPS) and Central Civil Services in group &#x27;A&#x27;; officers of the Indian Armed Forces; and the ambassadors and high commissioners to other countries on the recommendations of the Council of Ministers, among others.

The president, as the head of state, also receives the credentials of ambassadors from other countries, while the prime minister, as head of government, receives credentials of high commissioners from other members of the Commonwealth, in line with historical tradition.

The president is the &quot;de jure&quot; commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces.

The president of India can grant a pardon to or reduce the sentence of a convicted person once, particularly in cases involving the punishment of death. The decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the president are independent of the opinion of the prime minister or the Lok Sabha majority. In most other cases, however, the president exercises his or her executive powers on the advice of the prime minister.

=== Vice president ===

The vice president is the second-highest constitutional position in India after the president. The vice president represents the nation in the absence of the president and takes charge as acting president in the incident of resignation impeachment or removal of the president. The vice president also has the legislative function of acting as the chairman of the Rajya Sabha. The vice president is elected indirectly by members of an electoral college consisting of the members of both the houses of the parliament following the system of proportional representation employing the single transferable vote and the voting is by secret ballot conducted by the election commission.

=== Prime minister ===

The prime minister of India, as addressed in the Constitution of India, is the chief executive of the government and the leader of the majority party that holds a majority in the Lok Sabha. The prime minister leads the executive of the Government of India.

The prime minister is the senior member of the cabinet in the executive government in a parliamentary system. The prime minister selects and can dismiss other members of the cabinet; allocates posts to members within the Government; is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet and is responsible for bringing a proposal of legislation. The resignation or death of the prime minister dissolves the cabinet.

The prime minister is appointed by the president to assist the latter in the administration of the affairs of the executive.

=== Cabinet, ministries and agencies ===
The Union Council of Ministers includes the prime minister, Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of State (MoS). Each minister must be a member of one of the houses of the parliament. The cabinet is headed by the prime minister, and is advised by the cabinet secretary, who also acts as the head of the Indian Administrative Service and other civil services. Other members of the council are either union cabinet ministers, who are heads of various ministries; or ministers of state, who are junior members who report directly to one of the cabinet ministers, often overseeing a specific aspect of government; or ministers of state (independent charges), who do not report to a cabinet minister. As per article 88 of the constitution, every minister shall have the right to speak in, and to take part in the proceedings of, either house, any joint sitting of the houses, and any committee of parliament of which he may be named a member, but shall &quot;not&quot; be entitled to a vote in the house where he is not a member.

==== Secretaries ====

A secretary to the Government of India, a civil servant, generally an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, is the administrative head of the ministry or department, and is the principal adviser to the minister on all matters of policy and administration within the ministry/department. Secretaries to the Government of India rank 23rd on Indian order of precedence. Secretaries at the higher level are assisted by one or many additional secretaries, who are further assisted by joint secretaries. At the middle they are assisted by directors/deputy secretaries and under secretaries. At the lower level, there are section officers, assistant section officers, upper division clerks, lower division clerks and other secretarial staff.

=== Civil services ===

The Civil Services of India are the civil services and the permanent bureaucracy of India. The executive decisions are implemented by the Indian civil servants.

In the parliamentary democracy of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people based on universal adult suffrage. The ministers are indirectly responsible to the people themselves. But the handful of ministers is not expected to deal personally with the various problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants to enforce it.

==== Cabinet secretary ====

The cabinet secretary (IAST: ) is the top-most executive official and senior-most civil servant of the Government of India. The cabinet secretary is the &quot;ex-officio&quot; head of the Civil Services Board, the Cabinet Secretariat, the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the head of all civil services under the rules of business of the government.

The cabinet secretary is generally the senior-most officer of the Indian Administrative Service. The cabinet secretary ranks 11th on the Indian order of precedence. The cabinet secretary is under the direct charge of the prime minister. Presently, the Cabinet Secretary of India is Rajiv Gauba, IAS.

== Judiciary ==

India&#x27;s independent union judicial system began under the British, and its concepts and procedures resemble those of Anglo-Saxon countries. The Supreme Court of India consists of the chief justice and 33 associate justices, all appointed by the president on the advice of the Chief Justice of India. The jury trials were abolished in India in the early 1960s, after the famous case &quot;KM Nanavati v. the State of Maharashtra&quot;, for reasons of being vulnerable to media and public pressure, as well as to being misled.

Unlike its United States counterpart, the Indian justice system consists of a unitary system at both state and union levels. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of India, high courts at the state level, and district courts and Sessions Courts at the district level.

=== Supreme Court ===
The Supreme Court of India is situated in New Delhi, the capital region of India.

The Supreme Court is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal under the Constitution of India, the highest constitutional court, with the power of constitutional review. Consisting of the Chief Justice of India and 33 sanctioned other judges, it has extensive powers in the form of original, appellate and advisory jurisdictions.

As the final court of appeal of the country, it takes up appeals primarily against verdicts of the high courts of various states of the Union and other courts and tribunals. It safeguards fundamental rights of citizens and settles disputes between various governments in the country. As an advisory court, it hears matters which may specifically be referred to it under the constitution by the president. It also may take cognisance of matters on its own (or &#x27;suo moto&#x27;), without anyone drawing its attention to them. The law declared by the supreme court becomes binding on all courts within India and also by the union and state governments. Per , it is the duty of the president to enforce the decrees of the supreme court.

In addition, Article 32 of the constitution gives an extensive original jurisdiction to the supreme court concerning enforcing fundamental rights. It is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, &quot;mandamus&quot;, &quot;prohibition&quot;, &quot;quo warranto&quot; and &quot;certiorari&quot; to enforce them. The supreme court has been conferred with power to direct the transfer of any civil or criminal case from one state high court to another state high court, or from a Court subordinate to another state high court and the supreme court. Although the proceedings in the supreme court arise out of the judgment or orders made by the subordinate courts, of late the supreme court has started entertaining matters in which the interest of the public at large is involved. This may be done by any individual or group of persons either by filing a &quot;writ petition&quot; at the filing counter of the court or by addressing a letter to the Chief Justice of India, highlighting the question of public importance for redress. These are known as public interest litigations.

== Elections and voting ==
India has a quasi-federal form of government, called &quot;union&quot; or &quot;central&quot; government, with elected officials at the union, state and local levels. At the national level, the head of government, the prime minister, is appointed by the president of India from the party or coalition that has the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha. The members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected for a term of five years by universal adult suffrage through a first-past-the-post voting system. Members of the Rajya Sabha, which represents the states, are elected by the members of State legislative assemblies by proportional representation, except for 12 members who are nominated by the president.

India is currently the largest democracy in the world, with around 900 million eligible voters, as of 2019.

== State and local governments ==

In India, power is divided between the governments of the union and the states of India, the latter being ruled by the chiefs ministers. The state legislature is bicameral in six states and unicameral in the rest. The lower house is elected with a five-year term, while in the upper house one-third of the members in the house gets elected every two years with six-year terms.

Local governments function at the basic level. It is the third level of government apart from union and state governments. It consists of panchayats in rural areas and municipalities in urban areas. They are elected directly or indirectly by the people.

== Finance ==
=== Taxation ===
India has a three-tier tax structure, wherein the constitution empowers the union government to levy income tax, tax on capital transactions (wealth tax, inheritance tax), sales tax, service tax, customs and excise duties and the state governments to levy sales tax on intrastate sale of goods, taxon entertainment and professions, excise duties on manufacture of alcohol, stamp duties on transfer of property and collect land revenue (levy on land owned). The local governments are empowered by the state government to levy property tax and charge users for public utilities like water supply, sewage etc. More than half of the revenues of the union and state governments come from taxes, of which 3/4 come from direct taxes. More than a quarter of the union government&#x27;s tax revenues are shared with the state governments.

The tax reforms, initiated in 1991, have sought to rationalise the tax structure and increase compliance by taking steps in the following directions:
* Reducing the rates of individual and corporate income taxes, excises, and customs and making it more progressive
* Reducing exemptions and concessions
* Simplification of laws and procedures
* Introduction of permanent account number (PAN) to track monetary transactions
* 21 of the 29 states introduced value added tax (VAT) on 1 April 2005 to replace the complex and multiple sales tax system

The non-tax revenues of the central government come from fiscal services, interest receipts, public sector dividends, etc., while the non-tax revenues of the States are grants from the central government, interest receipts, dividends and income from general, economic and social services.

Inter-state share in the union tax pool is decided by the recommendations of the Finance Commission to the president.

Total tax receipts of Centre and State amount to approximately 18% of national GDP. This compares to a figure of 37–45% in the OECD.

=== Union budget ===
The Finance minister of India usually presents the annual union budget in the parliament on the last working day of February. However, for the F.Y. 2017–18, this tradition had been changed. Now the budget will be presented on the 1st day of February. The budget has to be passed by the Lok Sabha before it can come into effect on 1 April, the start of India&#x27;s fiscal year. The Union budget is preceded by an economic survey which outlines the broad direction of the budget and the economic performance of the country for the outgoing financial year

India&#x27;s non-development revenue expenditure had increased nearly five-fold in 2003–04 since 1990–91 and more than tenfold from 1985 to 1986. Interest payments are the single largest item of expenditure and accounted for more than 40% of the total non-development expenditure in the 2003–04 budget. Defence expenditure increased fourfold during the same period and has been increasing to defend from a difficult neighbourhood and external terror threats. In 2020–21, India&#x27;s defence budget stood at .

== Issues ==
=== Corruption ===
In 2009, several ministers are accused of corruption and nearly a quarter of the 543 elected members of parliament had been charged with crimes, including murder. Many of the biggest scandals since 2010 have involved high-level government officials, including cabinet ministers and chief ministers, such as the 2010 Commonwealth Games scam (), the Adarsh Housing Society scam, the Coal Mining Scam (), the mining scandal in Karnataka and the cash-for-votes scandal.

<text>Thomas Corwin (July 29, 1794 – December 18, 1865), also known as Tom Corwin, The Wagon Boy, and Black Tom was a politician from the state of Ohio. He represented Ohio in both houses of Congress and served as the 15th governor of Ohio and the 20th Secretary of the Treasury. After affiliating with the Whig Party, he joined the Republican Party in the 1850s. Corwin is best known for his sponsorship of the proposed Corwin Amendment, which was presented in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the oncoming American Civil War.

Corwin was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky, but he grew up in Lebanon, Ohio. After serving as a wagon boy in the War of 1812, he established a legal practice in Lebanon. He became a prosecuting attorney and won election to the Ohio House of Representatives. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1830 to 1840, resigning from Congress to take office as Ohio&#x27;s governor. He was defeated for re-election in 1842 but was elected by the state legislature to the United States Senate in 1844. As a Senator, he became a prominent opponent of the Mexican–American War. He resigned from the Senate to become Secretary of the Treasury under President Millard Fillmore.

Corwin returned to the United States House of Representatives in 1859. He led the House of Representatives&#x27; effort to end the secessionist crisis that arose following the 1860 elections. Corwin sponsored a constitutional amendment that would have forbidden the federal government from outlawing slavery, even through further constitutional amendments. Though several states ratified the amendment, it did not prevent the outbreak of the civil war. Corwin resigned from Congress in March 1861 to become the United States Ambassador to Mexico. He held that position until 1864 and died the following year.

==Early life==
Corwin, son of Matthias Corwin (1761–1829) and Patience Halleck, was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky on July 29, 1794. Corwin&#x27;s father served eleven times in the Ohio Legislature. Corwin&#x27;s cousin Moses Bledso Corwin was a United States Congressman from Ohio, and his nephew Franklin Corwin was a United States Congressman from Illinois.

Corwin moved with his parents to Lebanon, Ohio in 1798. During the War of 1812, he served as a wagon boy in General William Henry Harrison&#x27;s Army. In 1815, he began study of law in the offices of Joshua Collett, He was admitted to the bar in 1817, commencing practice in Lebanon; he was prosecuting attorney of Warren County from 1818 to 1828. On November 13, 1822, he married Sarah Ross, sister of Thomas R. Ross, then a member of Congress, at Lebanon. As a Freemason, he served the Grand Lodge of Ohio as Grand Orator in 1821 and 1826, Deputy Grand Master in 1823 and 1827 and Grand Master in 1828.

==Political career==

From 1822 to 1823, and in 1829, Corwin was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, where he made a spirited speech against the introduction of the whipping post into Ohio. In 1830 he was elected as a Whig to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from March 4, 1831, until his resignation, effective May 30, 1840, having become a candidate for the office of Governor of Ohio. Known for his sharp wit, debating skills, and endless campaigning, he was elected Governor in 1840, defeating incumbent Wilson Shannon. Shannon defeated Corwin in a rematch two years later.

Corwin was a Presidential elector in 1844 for the Whig Party ticket of Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen.

Corwin was also a member of the United States Senate, having been elected by the Ohio General Assembly as a Whig and served from March 4, 1845, to July 20, 1850. As a legislator he spoke seldom, but always with great ability, his most famous speech being one given on February 11, 1847, opposing the Mexican–American War.

Thomas Corwin, as quoted by Canadian humorist Stephen Leacock:


He resigned from the Senate to become President Millard Fillmore&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury shortly after the death of President Zachary Taylor. Like his immediate predecessor, William M. Meredith, Corwin believed in a protective tariff. Still, he did not want to make sudden or drastic changes in the free-trade tariff law of 1846. He objected to that law&#x27;s provisions, which taxed some imported raw materials at a higher rate than the imported manufactured goods made from those materials, stating in a report to Congress that &quot;such provisions certainly take from the manufacturer and artisan that encouragement which the present law was intended to afford.&quot; As a longtime Whig, however, Corwin was unsuccessful in passing any tariff legislation in a Congress controlled by Democrats. He retired as Secretary shortly after the end of Fillmore&#x27;s administration.

In 1857, former Ohio Governor William Bebb shot a man and was tried in 1858 for manslaughter in Winnebago County, Illinois, where he lived. Corwin and co-council Judge William Johnston obtained an acquittal with an argument of self-defense.

He was again elected to the House of Representatives in 1858, this time as a Republican and a member of the 36th Congress. In 1860, he was chairman of the House &quot;Committee of Thirty-three&quot;, consisting of one member from each state, and appointed to consider the condition of the nation and, if possible, to devise some scheme for reconciling the North and the South in the secessionist crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency. To that end, he sponsored a proposed Constitutional Amendment, which later became known as the Corwin Amendment, which forbade the Federal Government from outlawing slavery. It read:


Corwin&#x27;s amendment restated what most Americans already believed, that under the Constitution the Congress had no power to interfere with slavery in the states where it existed.

This doctrine is known as the Federal Consensus, and it was subscribed to by everyone from proslavery radicals like John C. Calhoun and abolitionist radicals like William Lloyd Garrison. Abraham Lincoln, like most Republicans, agreed that in peacetime the federal government could not abolish slavery in a state. The 1860 Republican Party platform restated the familiar doctrine. Prohibited by the Constitution from abolishing slavery in the southern states, antislavery politicians instead aimed at weakening slavery by other means—banning slavery in the territories, denying admission to new slave states, inhibiting the rendition of fugitive slaves in the North, suppressing slavery on the high seas, and abolishing slavery in Washington, D.C. For this reason, southerners had long discounted repeated northern promises not to abolish slavery in a state, and they were unimpressed when Corwin introduced his proposed amendment.

The Corwin amendment passed the Senate on March 2. However, only five states ratified it, and war began anyway. Thus, the initiative failed in its goal of preventing the outbreak of the American Civil War.

Corwin was reelected to the House of Representatives in 1860 but resigned on March 12, 1861, after being appointed by the newly inaugurated President Lincoln to become Minister to Mexico, where he served until 1864. Corwin, well regarded among the Mexican public for his opposition to the Mexican–American War while in the Senate, helped keep relations with the Mexicans friendly throughout the course of the Civil War, despite Confederate efforts to sway their allegiances.

==Death and legacy==

After resigning from his post as Minister, Corwin settled in Washington, D.C. in 1864, and practiced law until his death on December 18, 1865, at age 71. He is interred in Lebanon Cemetery, Lebanon, Ohio.

Corwin is remembered chiefly as an orator. His speeches both on the stump and in debate were examples of remarkable eloquence.

He acquired the nickname Black Tom not because he was African American in ancestry, but because of his dark, swarthy complexion. He did, however, sometimes portray himself, for comedic effect, as having African ancestry. According to Benjamin Perley Poore, Corwin was &quot;a born humorist&quot;: He [Corwin] was a middle-sized, somewhat stout man, with pleasing manners, a fine head, sparkling hazel eyes, and a complexion so dark that on several occasions – as he used to narrate with great glee – he was supposed to be of African descent. &quot;There is no need of my working,&quot; said he, &quot;for whenever I cannot support myself in Ohio, all I should have to do would be to cross the river, give myself up to a Kentucky negro-trader, be taken South, and sold for a field hand.&quot;

In 1876 the United States Revenue Cutter Service commissioned a cutter named USRC &quot;Thomas Corwin&quot;. In 1898, the village of Corwin, Ohio was named after him, which is located in Wayne Township, Warren County, Ohio. Corwin was the namesake of the Tom Corwin Coal Company. The associated company town Tom Corwin is an unincorporated community in Jackson County, Ohio.

<text>Story structure or narrative structure is the recognizable or comprehensible way in which a narrative&#x27;s different elements are unified, including in a particularly chosen order and sometimes specifically referring to the ordering of the plot: the narrative series of events, though this can vary based on culture. In a play or work of theatre especially, this can be called dramatic structure, which is presented in audiovisual form. Story structure can vary by culture and by location. The following is an overview of various story structures and components that might be considered.

== Definition ==
Story is a sequence of events, which can be true or fictitious, that appear in prose, verse or script, designed to amuse or inform an audience. Story structure is a way to organize the story&#x27;s elements into a recognizable sequence. It has been shown to influence how the brain organizes information. Story structures can vary culture to culture and throughout history. The same named story structure may also change over time as the culture also changes.

== Variations == 
=== Three-act structure ===

The three-act structure is a common structure in classical film and other narrative forms in or associated with the West.

First described in the fourth century A.D. by Aelius Donatus in his commentary on the works of Terence, the form was popularized by Syd Field in &quot;Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting.&quot; Based on his recommendation that a play have a &quot;beginning, middle, and end,&quot; the structure has been falsely attributed to Aristotle, who in fact argued for a two-act structure consisting of a &quot;complication&quot; and &quot;dénouement&quot; split by a peripeteia.

The sections are:

The first act begins with setup, where all of the main characters and their basic situations are introduced, as well as the setting. It contains the primary level of characterization for both of these (exploring the characters&#x27; backgrounds and personalities, the relationships between them, and the dynamics of the world they live in). This setup is often called the exposition.

Later in the first act, the protagonist experiences a dynamic event known as the inciting incident (or catalyst). Their initial actions are to deal with this event and attempt to reestablish order. These lead to the first plot point, where the first act ends and a dramatic question is raised; for example, &quot;Will X disable the bomb?&quot; or &quot;Will Y end up with their love interest?&quot;

The second act, or confrontation, is considered to be the bulk of the story. Here, the characters&#x27; conflict is most developed (particularly between the protagonist and antagonist) as well as any changes in values and personality one or more characters may undergo (known as character development, or a character arc). This leads to the second plot point, where the second act ends and the protagonist returns to their ordinary world.

The third act, or resolution, is when the problem in the story boils over, forcing the characters to confront it, allowing all the elements of the story to come together, leading to the climax, which is the answer to the dramatic question, being hand in hand with the end of the conflict.

=== Kishōtenketsu ===

Kishōtenketsu is a structure mainly derived from classic Chinese, Korean, and Japanese narratives.
Kishōtenketsu is divided into four sections, which have been defined and used differently by narratives from each of the three cultures where the form is most commonly found. The first section is generally considered an introduction of sorts across all three interpretations, albeit understood by each in a different way. The second may refer to the development, or to a beginning of an action related to self-realization. The third section is based around a turning point, change in direction, reversal, or twist. The fourth and final section concerns itself with a result or conclusion, a consequence thereof, or a &#x27;coming to fruition&#x27;.

== History ==
This covers a loose worldwide history of story structure.

===European and European Diaspora===
The first known treaties on story structure comes from Aristotle&#x27;s Poetics. He advocated for a continuous two-act plot: δέσις (desis) and λύσις (lysis) which roughly translates to binding and unbinding, that was not centered on &quot;one individual&quot;, but where the characters learn a lesson through negative reinforcement. He believed the Chorus was the most important part of the story.

Later scholars such as Horace in &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; and Aelius Donatus in &quot;Aeli Donati qvod fertvr Commentvm Terenti: Accendvnt Evgravphi Volume 2&quot; argued for a five act chorus. Neither specify that five acts should be for the story itself, but for the chorus.

However, the majority of the treaties for story structure took off in the 19th-20th centuries, the first notable figure being Gustav Freytag&#x27;s &quot;Die Technik des Dramas&quot; which was published in 1863. He outlined the basics for what would later become the foundation for the three and five act story structures. He outlined the sections of the story as Introduction, Rise, Climax, Return or Fall, and Catastrophe.

Some theorists had issues with Gustav Freytag&#x27;s theories and directly went against him, such as 
Georges Polti in The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations in which he goes out of his way to mention current French, Chinese, Jewish, English, and other cultures that Gustav Freytag put down as never good enough, excepting Shakespeare. Polti argued for multiple shapes and situations of plots.

This continued into the 19th century when Selden Lincoln Whitcomb wrote &quot;A Study of a Novel&quot; which examines the basis for Silas Mariner&#x27;s plot structure, where he argues for the Line of Emotion on Page 39. He argues that &quot;The general epistolary structure may be partially represented by a graphic design.&quot; For this, he posts a proposed design for Miss. Burney Evelina on page 21.

He presupposes that stories might have different shapes for those emotions. This leads to diagraming, later described by Joseph Esenwein, who directly cited him, but argued that the diagram was supposed to be used only for short stories. He follows Selden Lincoln Whitcomb&#x27;s recommendations and says that the parts are incident, emotion, crisis, suspense, climax, dénouement, conclusion.

This diagram was copied and explained one for one by Kenneth Rowe almost verbatim, in Kenneth Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Write That Play&quot;, though no credit was given to Joseph Esenwein. The plot structure was then used by Death of a Salesman author Arthur Miller.

However, the coining for &quot;Exposition&quot; as the first part goes to earlier author, Rev. J.K. Brennan, who wrote his essay &quot;The General Design of Plays for the book &#x27;The Delphian Course&#x27;&quot; (1912) for the Delphian Society. Exposition, not Introduction nor &quot;Incident&quot; are used as the first part.

This leads to Percy Lubbock who wrote &quot;The Craft of Fiction&quot; in 1921. He argued that there were too many story structures in the time period which made it harder to study academically, and thus proposed that conflict should be at the center of all stories, using such works as &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy. He also advocated for Death of the Author in his work. He made a concentrated effort to look at conflict at the center of stories.

Writers such as E. M. Forster and Virginia Wolf diasgreed with him, the latter of which wrote in November 1923: &quot;This is my prime discovery so far; &amp; the fact that I&#x27;ve been so long finding it, proves, I think, how false Percy Lubbock&#x27;s doctrine is--that you can do this sort of thing consciously.&quot; She went back and forth on the work throughout her life. She thus wrote some bits on their own treaties.

Gertrude Stein also later contributed to the general feel of stories by promoting stream-of-consciousness and supported much of Literary Modernism and looking at writing as a look into psychology.

This was furthered by Lajos Egri who advocated for using psychology to build characters in The Art of Dramatic Writing, published 1946. He also examines character through the lens of physiology, sociology and psychology.

However, there was a rise in structuralism in the mid-to-late 20th century with such thinkers as
Roland Barthes, Vladimir Propp, Joseph Campbell, and Northrop Frye, who often tried to find a unifying idea for story structure and how to academically study it. For example, Joseph Campbell tried to find one unifying story structure for myth, Roland Barthes further argued for the Death of the Author theory and Propp tried to find a story structure for Russian folktales.

In Northrop Frye&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot;, he deals extensively with what he calls myths of spring, summer, fall, and winter:

* Spring myths are comedies, that is, stories that lead from bad situations to happy endings. Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; is such a story.
* Summer myths are similarly utopian fantasies such as Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;.
* Fall myths are tragedies that lead from ideal situations to disaster. Compare &quot;Hamlet, Othello&quot;, and &quot;King Lear&quot; and the movie &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;.
* Winter myths are dystopias; for example, George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;, Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and Ayn Rand&#x27;s novella &quot;Anthem&quot;.

In Frye&#x27;s &quot;Great Code&quot;, he offers two narrative structures for plots:
* A U-shaped structure, that is, a story that begins with a state of equilibrium that descends to disaster and then upward to a new stable condition. This is the shape of a comedy.
* An inverted U-shape structure, that is, a story in which the protagonist rises to prominence and descends to disaster. This is the shape of tragedy.

Lajos Egri is then credited in Syd Field&#x27;s last edition of &quot;The Foundations of a Screenwriting&quot; published in 1979. The book argued for three acts, not five, and had no peak in the final diagram.

This idea of a universal story structure fell out of favor with poststructuralism. Theorists such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida asserted that such universally shared, deep structures were logically impossible.

At the same time that Literary Structuralists rose with story structure, there were also Postmodernism and Post-postmodernism, which often argued about the nature of stories and what, if existing, story structures could be. Some authors, such as John Gardner, advocated for the use of both, such as in &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; (1983).

Ideas of this got shared over the next few decades, which lead to writers such as Blake Snyder, who in Save the Cat contributed language such as &quot;Story Beats&quot;.

However, other story structures became more widely known in the 2010s-2020s, when European and European diaspora writers became aware of story structures such as kishotenketsu, which was said to be used in films such as Everything Everywhere All at Once.

== Categories ==
Most forms of narrative fall under two main categories: linear narrative and nonlinear narrative. Other forms also include interactive narration, and interactive narrative. 
*Linear narrative is the most common form of narration, where events are largely portrayed in a chronological order telling the events in the order in which they occurred.
*Nonlinear narrative, disjointed narrative, or disrupted narrative, is a narrative technique where events are portrayed out of chronological order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern.
*Interactive narration refers to a work where the linear narrative is driven by, rather than influenced by, the user&#x27;s interaction.
*Interactive narrative is a form of fiction in which users are able to make &quot;choices&quot; that influence the narrative (for example, through alternative plots or resulting in alternative endings) through their actions.

=== Linear narrative ===
Flashbacks, often confused with true narratives, are not strictly linear, but the concept relies upon a fundamentally linear understanding of the narrative. An example would be &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; by Orson Welles. Although some films appear to open (very briefly) with the ending, flashback movies almost immediately jump back to the very beginning of the story to proceed linearly from there. Usually the film will proceed past the supposed &quot;ending&quot; shown at the beginning of the movie.

=== Nonlinear narrative ===
Cinema can only provide the illusion through broken narrative, a famous example of this being the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The film is ostensibly three short stories, which, upon closer inspection, are actually three sections of one story with the chronology broken up; Quentin Tarantino constructs the narrative without resorting to classic &quot;flashback&quot; techniques.

An even more ambitious attempt at constructing a film based on non-linear narrative is Alain Resnais&#x27;s 1993 French film &quot;Smoking/No Smoking&quot;. The plot contains parallel developments, playing on the idea of what might have happened had the characters made different choices.

Outside of film, some novels also present their narrative in a non-linear fashion. Creative writing professor Jane Alison describes nonlinear narrative &quot;patterns&quot; such as spirals, waves, and meanders in her 2019 book &quot;Meander, Spiral, Explode: Design and Pattern in Narrative&quot;. The chapters of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni&#x27;s novel Before We Visit the Goddess are not arranged based on the linear sequence of events, but rather in a way that fulfills certain literary techniques. This allows the characters in the novel to have a believable life timeline while still employing the techniques that make a story enjoyable.

=== Interactive narration ===
In works of interactive narration there is only one narrative, but the method of delivery requires the user to actively work to gain the next piece of the narrative, or have to piece the parts of narrative that they have together in order to form a coherent narrative.

This is the narrative approach of some modern video games. A player will be required to reach an objective, complete a task, solve a puzzle, or finish a level before the narrative continues.

=== Interactive narrative ===
An interactive narrative is one which is composed with a branching structure where a single starting point may lead to multiple developments and outcomes. The principle of all such games is that, at each step of the narrative, the user makes choices that advance the story, leading to a new series of choices. Authoring non-linear narrative or dialogue thus implies imagining an indefinite number of parallel stories.

In a gamebook, readers are told to turn to a certain page according to the choice they wish to make to continue the story. Typically, the choice will be an action rather than dialogue. For example, the hero hears a noise in another room and must decide to open the door and investigate, run away, or call for help. This kind of interactive experience of a story is possible with video games and books (where the reader is free to turn the pages) but less adapted to other forms of entertainment. Improvisational theatre is similarly open-ended, but of course cannot be said to be authored.

== Graphic narrative ==
A simple graphic narrative, such as in comics, has four stages: an introduction of the characters and a description of a situation; the introduction of a problem, unexpected opportunity, or other complication into the situation; a resolution in the form of a partial or complete response to the problem by one or more of the characters; and the denouement, the aftermath of the response that makes clear the success, partial success, non-success, or uncertain success of the response. This fourth stage may also show how the original situation has changed due to what has taken place in the Complication and Resolution stages of the narrative.

In a simple narrative, the four stages appear in order. That is, the sequence of the telling or presentation follows the chronology of the told. In a more complex story, the order of the telling may vary. For instance, such a story may begin with the Denouement and then present the Situation, Complication, and Resolution in a flashback. But this is not the case with a simple narrative.

<text>Donald C. Hoefler (October 3, 1922 – April 15, 1986) was an American journalist, best known for using the term &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; for the first time in a news story. His friend Ralph Vaerst suggested the term for a series of articles entitled &quot;Silicon Valley, USA&quot; in the weekly trade newspaper &quot;Electronic News&quot;, starting on January 11, 1971.

While Hoefler was the first to use &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; in journalism, he did not coin the phrase, which had been in use for some time. For example, a May 1970 advertisement in the &quot;Peninsula Times Tribune&quot; described a Palo Alto company that &quot;helps production people in Silicon Valley.&quot;

==Career==
Before working on his weekly newsletter, Hoefler was a publicist and reporter for Fairchild Publications, McGraw-Hill, RCA Corp. and Fairchild Semiconductor.

From the mid-1970s until his death in 1986, Hoefler published a newsletter called &quot;Microelectronics News,&quot; which was the definitive &quot;tabloid&quot; of the emerging American semiconductor industry but was also viewed as a &quot;gossip sheet&quot; by some. He published this newsletter for 14 years. The Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History has most issues of the newsletter available for viewing on the internet.

Hoefler began his career in electronics journalism as a publicist for Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View. He subsequently worked as a reporter for Fairchild Publications, owner of &quot;Electronic News&quot;, and then held editorial positions with RCA Corp. and McGraw Hill.

==Family==
Hoefler was married to his wife Rachel Hoefler and together they lived in South San Francisco and in Cupertino during the 70s. Hoefler had been married to Louise Hoefler for 41 years at the time of her death. Louise died at the family home in Carmel Valley, Ca. in 1984. He married Rachel in 1985, shortly before his death. He was preceded in death by his son Stephen who died in 1983, at the age of 26. He had three other children that survived him, oldest son David, daughter Elisabeth, and son Paul. He was also survived by his mother Mena, and brother William, along with his sisters Betsy and Carol.

==Death==
Hoefler died at the age of 63 on April 15, 1986, after a lengthy illness. Before his death, he was hospitalized for a stroke and slipped into a coma. He later died at Fort Miley Veterans Hospital in San Francisco, California. Hoefler donated his body to the University of California at San Francisco Medical School.

<doc id="553893" wikidata="Q2914539" url="?curid=553893" title="Jeff Probst">
<text>Jeffrey Lee Probst (; born November 4, 1961) is an American television presenter and producer and young adult fiction writer. He is best known as the Emmy Award-winning host of the American version of the reality television show &quot;Survivor&quot; since 2000. He was also the host of &quot;The Jeff Probst Show&quot;, a syndicated daytime talk show produced by CBS Television Distribution from September 2012 to May 2013.

==Early life==
Probst was born at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, Kansas, the oldest of three sons to Jerry and Barbara Probst. His family moved to Bellevue, Washington when Probst was 15 years old. After graduating from Newport High School in 1979, Probst attended Seattle Pacific University but left before graduating to pursue a career in television. Soon after leaving college, he began working at Boeing Motion Picture/Television studio as a producer and later narrator of marketing and training videos.

==Career==

In addition to &quot;Survivor&quot;, Probst once hosted FX&#x27;s original half-hour show dedicated to answering viewer letters, &quot;Backchat&quot;, along with &quot;Sound FX&quot;, a music series featuring Orlando Jones (1996). Probst also hosted the VH1 series &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!&quot; from 1998 to 2001 and was a correspondent for the syndicated program &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;. He also wrote and directed the Lionsgate released film, &quot;Finder&#x27;s Fee&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine named Probst one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; in 2001. He often contributes to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; by giving &quot;Survivor&quot; related clues from the show&#x27;s venues, has twice appeared on Celebrity &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, first in 2001 and again in 2003, and made several cameo appearances during the April 1, 2010, episode. He was a frequent guest star on the sketch show &quot;MADtv&quot;, guest-starring once a season since the show&#x27;s 9th season. He hosted &quot;Celebrity Superfan Roundtable&quot; for Howard Stern. 

Probst is the host of &quot;Survivor,&quot; a globally-syndicated American reality show which he has hosted since its inception in 2000. He has stated that he had worked hard to get a meeting with series creator Mark Burnett as he believed the show was &quot;something special.&quot; Probst caught Burnett&#x27;s eye in 1999 when he interviewed Sandra Bullock while working for &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;. Burnett was impressed by Probst&#x27;s ability to garner honest answers from media trained celebrities and felt that his relative anonymity would allow the show to be built &quot;from the ground up.&quot; Probst has won four Primetime Emmy Awards as the host of &quot;Survivor&quot;. He delivers the series&#x27;s signature catch-phrase to losing contestants, &quot;The tribe has spoken. It&#x27;s time for you to go,&quot; which was included in TV Land&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases&quot; special in 2006. 

On October 20, 2008, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that Probst was developing a new reality TV series for CBS called &quot;Live for the Moment&quot; that was to feature people with terminal illnesses being taken on &quot;the last adventure of their life&quot; before they die. Only the pilot was aired, on January 28, 2010.

On April 1, 2009, Probst appeared on the CBS reality television special &quot;I Get That a Lot&quot;, in which he worked a cash register.

In October 2011, he appeared as himself on the sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Stinson Missile Crisis&quot;.

In January 2012, Probst was announced as director of his second feature film, coming-of-age story &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, starring John Corbett and Sarah Bolger, with production scheduled to begin in Los Angeles the following month.

Probst hosted &quot;The Jeff Probst Show&quot;, a syndicated daytime talk show produced by CBS Television Distribution from September 2012 to May 2013. CBS did not pick up the show for a second season, citing low ratings. Between October 2012 and January 2014, Probst hosted the recurring Adult Swim special, &quot;The Greatest Event in Television History,&quot; which consisted of remakes of 1980s TV show title sequences.

In February 2013, Probst teamed up with Christopher Tebbetts to release the first of Scholastic&#x27;s adventure series &quot;Stranded&quot;, aimed at middle school students, grades 4–6. It follows the story of Vanessa, Buzz, Carter, and Jane as they are left on a deserted island and forced to fend for themselves. It started out as a regular vacation but when a storm sets in, the kids are shipwrecked in the middle of the South Pacific without any parents. They must find a way to work together if they are ever to get off the island. &quot;Stranded&quot; is the first of the three-book series.

In November 2013 and January 2014, Probst appeared as himself on the sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; in two season 11 episodes, &quot;Some Kind of Lesbian Zombie&quot; and &quot;Baseball. Boobs. Boobs. Baseball.&quot;.

In December 2016, Probst appeared as himself on the sitcom &quot;Life in Pieces&quot;, in the episode &quot;Swim Survivor Zen Talk&quot;.

In October 2022, Probst appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the season 48 episode hosted by Jack Harlow. He appeared in the &quot;Joker Wedding&quot; sketch.
==Personal life==
Probst was married to his first wife, psychotherapist Shelley Wright, from 1996 to 2001. In 2004, after filming on &quot;&quot; wrapped, he began dating one of the contestants, Julie Berry. They broke up in early 2008. 

Probst married his second wife, Lisa Ann Russell, on December 5, 2011. Through this marriage, Probst is a stepfather to Russell&#x27;s two children, son Michael (b. 2004) and daughter Ava (b. 2006), from her former marriage to actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar. Probst has stated that he and his wife amicably share custody with Gosselaar and his second wife, and that the children consider all four to be parents.

Probst keeps the snuffer that he uses to snuff the torches when a contestant is voted out of the game as a souvenir after every season of &quot;Survivor&quot;.
He has written a book called &quot;Stranded&quot;, based on the show &quot;Survivor.&quot; As an ordained minister, he has presided over the weddings of several of his friends.

==Awards==

On September 21, 2008, Probst won the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. He won the same award in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; attributed Probst&#x27;s track record in the category to his penchant for interacting with contestants on a compassionate personal level unseen in any of his competitors, transcending his role of host to that of counselor.

<text>Makassar Strait () is a strait between the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi in Indonesia. To the north it joins the Celebes Sea, while to the south it meets the Java Sea. To the northeast, it forms the Sangkulirang Bay south of the Mangkalihat Peninsula. The strait is an important regional shipping route in Southeast Asia.

The Mahakam River and Karangan River of Borneo empty into the strait.

Ports along the strait include Balikpapan and Bontang in Borneo, and Makassar, Palu, and Parepare in Sulawesi. The city of Samarinda is 48 km (30 mi) from the strait, along the Mahakam.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Makassar Strait as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:

The channel between the East coast of Borneo and the West coast of Celebes [Sulawesi], is bounded:

&quot;On the North.&quot; By a line joining Tanjong Mangkalihat, Borneo () and Stroomen Kaap (Cape Binar), Celebes ().

&quot;On the South.&quot; By a line from the Southwestern extreme of Celebes (), through the Southern point of Tana Keke, to the Southern extreme of Laoet () thence up the West coast of that island to Tanjong Kiwi and thence across to Tanjong Petang, Borneo () at the Southern end of Laoet Strait.
== Geology ==
The Makassar Strait and North Makassar Basin is the result of back-arc extension due to the subduction of a small tectonic slab to the east. Rifting began in the Eocene, with high sedimentation rates filling the extension basin throughout the Eocene through Miocene. These Miocene basin sediments hold very large amounts of oil and natural gas deposits, especially in the hydrocarbon rich Kutei Basin. 

The arrival of the Benggai Sula microplate has rotated the Island of Sulawesi in a counter-clockwise direction, allowing opening of the southern Makassar Basin with accommodation by the Adang/Paternoster Fault.

<doc id="553896" wikidata="Q163588" url="?curid=553896" title="Symphony No. 1 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 1 in F minor, Op. 10, by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in 1924–1925, and first performed in Leningrad by the Leningrad Philharmonic under Nicolai Malko on 12 May 1926. Shostakovich wrote the work as his graduation piece at the Petrograd Conservatory, completing it at the age of 19.

==Structure==

The work has four movements (the last two being played without interruption) and is approximately half an hour in length.

==Instrumentation==

The work is written for:
;Woodwinds:
:Piccolo (doubling 3rd Flute)
:2 Flutes (with 2nd doubling 2nd Piccolo)
:2 Oboes
:2 Clarinets
:2 Bassoons

;Brass:

:Triangle
:Glockenspiel

;Keyboard
:Piano

;Strings:
:1st Violins
:2nd Violins
:Violas
:Cellos
:Double basses
==Overview==
While Shostakovich wrote this piece as his graduation exercise from Maximilian Steinberg&#x27;s composition class, some of the material may have dated from considerably earlier. When the composer&#x27;s aunt, Nadezhda Galli-Shohat, first heard the work at its American premiere by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra, she recognised in it many fragments she had heard young Mitya play as a child. Some of these fragments were associated with La Fontaine&#x27;s retelling of Aesop&#x27;s fable of The Ant and the Grasshopper and Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

The immediate parallel to the 19-year-old composer presenting his first symphony was Alexander Glazunov, himself a child prodigy who had his First Symphony performed at an even younger age. Glazunov may have recognised in Shostakovich an echo of his younger self. As director of the Petrograd Conservatory, Glazunov had followed Shostakovich&#x27;s progress since his entrance at age 13. He also arranged for the premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s symphony, which took place 44 years after Glazunov&#x27;s First Symphony had first been presented in the same hall.

This symphony was a tremendous success from its premiere. Nicolai Malko, who conducted the symphony&#x27;s world premiere, said that its maturity was &quot;impossible to deny&quot;. It displays an interesting and characteristic combination of liveliness and wit on the one hand, and drama and tragedy on the other. In some ways it is reminiscent of the works of Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. The transparent and chamber-like orchestration of the First Symphony is in quite a contrast to the Mahlerian orchestrations found in many of his later symphonies, and the assurance with which the composer imagines, then realises large-scale structure, is as impressive as his vigour and freshness of gesture.

==Influences==
Because of the traditionalist mindset of the Conservatory, Shostakovich did not discover the music of Igor Stravinsky until his late teens. The effect of hearing this music was instant and radical, with Stravinsky&#x27;s compositions continuing to hold a considerable influence over Shostakovich. Some critics have suggested the First Symphony was influenced by Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, not just due to the prominence of the piano part in its orchestration but also due to the overall tone of satire in the first half of the symphony. Because the plot in Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet chronicled the doomed antics of an animated puppet, it would have reflected his observations on the mechanical aspects of human behaviour and appealed directly to the satirist in him.

Still another musical influence, suggested by the opening clarinet phrase which becomes used considerably in the course of the symphony, is Richard Strauss&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot;.

<doc id="553897" wikidata="Q555857" url="?curid=553897" title="Chemical oxygen demand">
<text>In environmental chemistry, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) is an indicative measure of the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by reactions in a measured solution. It is commonly expressed in mass of oxygen consumed over volume of solution, which in SI units is milligrams per liter (mg/L). A COD test can be used to quickly quantify the amount of organics in water. The most common application of COD is in quantifying the amount of oxidizable pollutants found in surface water (e.g. lakes and rivers) or wastewater. COD is useful in terms of water quality by providing a metric to determine the effect an effluent will have on the receiving body, much like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).

==Overview ==
The basis for the COD test is that nearly all organic compounds can be fully oxidized to carbon dioxide with a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. The amount of oxygen required to oxidize an organic compound to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water is given by:
:formula_1
This expression does not include the oxygen demand caused by nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia into nitrate:

:formula_2
Dichromate, the oxidizing agent for COD determination, does not oxidize ammonia into nitrate, so nitrification is not included in the standard COD test.

The International Organization for Standardization describes a standard method for measuring chemical oxygen demand in ISO 6060 . However, this ISO standard was withdrawn in 2024.

== Using potassium dichromate==
Potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. Acidity is usually achieved by the addition of sulfuric acid. The reaction of potassium dichromate with organic compounds is given by:

:formula_3

where formula_4. Most commonly, a 0.25 N solution of potassium dichromate is used for COD determination, although for samples with COD below 50 mg/L, a lower concentration of potassium dichromate is preferred.

In the process of oxidizing the organic substances found in the water sample, potassium dichromate is reduced (since in all redox reactions, one reagent is oxidized and the other is reduced), forming Cr3+. The amount of Cr3+ is determined after oxidization is complete and is used as an indirect measure of the organic contents of the water sample.

===Measurement of excess===
An excess amount of potassium dichromate (or any oxidizing agent) must be present for all organic matter to be completely oxidized. Once oxidation is complete, the amount of excess potassium dichromate must be measured to ensure that the amount of Cr3+ can be accurately determined. To do so, the excess potassium dichromate is titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) until all of the excess oxidizing agent has been reduced to Cr3+. Typically, the oxidation-reduction indicator ferroin is added during this titration step. Once all the excess dichromate has been reduced, the ferroin indicator changes from blue-green to a reddish brown. The amount of ferrous ammonium sulfate added is equivalent to excess potassium dichromate added to the original sample. Note: Ferroin indicator is bright red from commercially prepared sources, but it exhibits a green hue when added to a digested sample containing potassium dichromate. During the titration, the color of the indicator changes from a green hue to a bright blue hue and then to a reddish brown upon reaching the endpoint. Ferroin indicator changes from red to pale blue when oxidized. 

==Preparation of ferroin indicator reagent==
A solution of 1.485 g 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate is added to a solution of 695 mg FeSO4·7H2O in distilled water, and the resulting red solution is diluted to 100 mL.

===Calculations===
The following formula is used to calculate COD:

:formula_5

where &quot;b&quot; is the volume of FAS used in the blank sample, &quot;s&quot; is the volume of FAS in the original sample, and &quot;n&quot; is the normality of FAS. If milliliters are used consistently for volume measurements, the result of the COD calculation is given in mg/L.

The COD can also be estimated from the concentration of oxidizable compound in the sample, based on its stoichiometric reaction with oxygen to yield CO2 (assume all C goes to CO2), H2O (assume all H goes to H2O), and NH3 (assume all N goes to NH3), using the following formula:

:COD = (&quot;C&quot;/FW)·(RMO)·32

Where 
:&quot;C&quot; = Concentration of oxidizable compound in the sample,
:FW = Formula weight of the oxidizable compound in the sample,
:RMO = Ratio of the # of moles of oxygen to # of moles of oxidizable compound in their reaction to CO2, water, and ammonia

For example, if a sample has 500 Wppm (Weight Parts per Million) of phenol:

:C6H5OH + 7O2 → 6CO2 + 3H2O

:COD = (500/94)·7·16*2 = 1192 Wppm

==Inorganic interference==
Some samples of water contain high levels of oxidizable inorganic materials which may interfere with the determination of COD. Because of its high concentration in most wastewater, chloride is often the most serious source of interference. Its reaction with potassium dichromate follows the equation:

:formula_6

To eliminate chloride interference, mercuric sulfate can be added to the sample prior to the addition of other reagents.

The following table lists several other inorganic substances that may cause interference. It also lists chemicals that may be used to eliminate such interference and the compounds formed when the inorganic molecule is eliminated.

==Government regulation==
Many governments impose strict regulations regarding the maximum chemical oxygen demand allowed in wastewater before it can be returned to the environment. For example, in Switzerland, a maximum oxygen demand between 200 and 1000 mg/L must be reached before wastewater or industrial water can be returned to the environment .

==History==
For many years, the strong oxidizing agent potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was used for measuring chemical oxygen demand. Measurements were called &quot;oxygen consumed&quot; from permanganate rather than organic substances&#x27; &quot;oxygen demand&quot;. Potassium permanganate&#x27;s effectiveness at oxidizing organic compounds varied widely, and in many cases, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measurements were often much greater than results from COD measurements. This indicated that potassium permanganate could not effectively oxidize all organic compounds in water, rendering it a relatively poor oxidizing agent for determining COD.

Since then, other oxidizing agents such as ceric sulphate, potassium iodate, and potassium dichromate have been used to determine COD. Of these, potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is the most effective: it is relatively cheap, easy to purify, and can nearly completely oxidize almost all organic compounds.

In these methods, a fixed volume with a known excess amount of the oxidant is added to a sample of the solution being analyzed. After a refluxing digestion step, the initial concentration of organic substances in the sample is calculated from a titrimetric or spectrophotometric determination of the oxidant remaining in the sample. As with all colorimetric methods, blanks are used to control for contamination by outside material.

<text>A phosphite ion in inorganic chemistry usually refers to [HPO3]2− but includes [H2PO3]− ([HPO2(OH)]−). These anions are the conjugate bases of phosphorous acid (H3PO3). The corresponding salts, e.g. sodium phosphite (Na2HPO3) are reducing in character.

==Nomenclature==
The IUPAC recommended name for phosphorous acid is phosphonic acid. Correspondingly, the IUPAC-recommended name for the ion is phosphonate. In the US the IUPAC naming conventions for inorganic compounds are taught at high school, but not as a &#x27;required&#x27; part of the curriculum. A well-known university-level textbook follows the IUPAC recommendations. In practice any reference to &quot;phosphite&quot; should be investigated to determine the naming convention being employed.

==Salts containing HPO32−, called phosphonates or phosphites==
From the commercial perspective, the most important phosphite salt is basic lead phosphite. Many salts containing the phosphite ion have been investigated structurally, these include sodium phosphite pentahydrate (Na2HPO3·5H2O). (NH4)2HPO3·H2O, CuHPO3·H2O, SnHPO3 and Al2(HPO3)3·4H2O. The structure of is approximately tetrahedral.

 has a number of canonical resonance forms making it isoelectronic with bisulfite ion, , which has a similar structure.

==Salts containing HP(O)2OH−==
Acid or hydrogen phosphites are called hydrogenphosphonates or acid phosphites. IUPAC recommends the name hydrogenphosphonates). They are anions HP(O)2OH−. A typical derivative is the salt [NH4][HP(O)2OH]. Many related salts are known, e.g., RbHPHO3, CsHPHO3, TlHPHO3. These salts are prepared by treating phosphorous acid with the metal carbonate. These compounds contain a layer polymeric anion consisting of HPO3 tetrahedra linked by hydrogen bonds. These layers are interleaved by layers of metal cations.

Organic esters of hydrogen phosphites are anions with the formula HP(O)2OR− (R = organic group). One commercial example is the fungicide fosetyl-Al with the formula [C2H5OP(H)O2]3Al.

==Salts containing H2P2O52−, called diphosphites or pyrophosphites==
Pyrophosphites (diphosphites) can be produced by gently heating acid phosphites under reduced pressure. They contain the ion , which can be formulated [HP(O)2O−P(O)2H]2−.

==Parallels in arsenic chemistry==
In contrast to the paucity of evidence for , the corresponding arsenic ion, ortho-arsenite, is known. An example is Ag3AsO3 as well as the polymeric meta-arsenite . The iso-electronic sulfite ion, is known from its salts.
==Use as fungicides==

Inorganic phosphites (containing ) have been applied to crops to combat fungus-like pathogens of the order oomycetes (water molds). The situation is confusing because of the similarity in name between phosphite and phosphate (a major plant nutrient and fertilizer ingredient), and controversial because phosphites have sometimes been advertised as fertilizers, even though they are converted to phosphate too slowly to serve as a plant&#x27;s main phosphorus source. In fact, phosphites may cause phytotoxicity when a plant is starved of phosphates. Lemoynie and others have described this complicated situation and noted that calling phosphites fertilizers avoided the regulatory complication and negative public perceptions that might have been incurred by registering them as fungicides.

A major form of inorganic phosphite used in agriculture is monopotassium phosphite. This compound does serve as a potassium fertilizer.

<text>Graham Cyril Russell (born 11 June 1950) is a British musician, singer-songwriter, producer and guitarist of the soft rock duo Air Supply.

In 1975, with Russell Hitchcock, he formed Air Supply in Australia. The duo have been singing and performing romantic songs and ballads, such as &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, &quot;All Out of Love&quot;, &quot;Every Woman in the World&quot;, &quot;The One That You Love&quot;, &quot;Even the Nights Are Better&quot;, &quot;Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, for more than 45 years.

== Early life ==
Russell was born in Arnold, Nottingham. He had a strong interest in poetry, music and books since his childhood. In 1961, at the age of 11, he started writing poems and composed his first song, called &quot;That Rockin&#x27; Feeling&quot;.

Self-taught, he learned to play guitar and percussion alone and, after the loss of his mother in childhood, he became a loner and thereby found in music and poems a way to express his loss and his emotions.

He attended the Carlton-Le-Willows, a technical school in Gedling, Nottingham, where his love for literature and the great English poets only grew further, fueled by study and also an interest that developed on the arts of the paranormal and occult sciences, highlighted by the works of writers Shelley, Keats, and Lord Byron.

In 1963, the music of the Beatles was a strong influence that marked his life that year, and after watching a live show in 1964, Russell decided that he wanted to be a musician. Russell joined a band called Union Blues in 1965, where he played percussion, but really wanted to play his own songs in front of the stage.

== Career ==
In 1968, he moved to Australia and formed a second band in Melbourne, and began to also play solo in cafes and dance clubs, gaining ground on the Australian circuit.

In 1973, after reading spiritual and mystical content in search of knowledge and answers for several questions about life, Russell joined the rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in 1975 and met Russell Hitchcock on the first day and became instant friends. They would sing Beatles songs together during and after shows and this would eventually lead them to form the band Air Supply.
After 18 months in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock formed the band under the name which Graham Russell had seen in a dream, a giant bright lights plate in which could be read &quot;Air Supply&quot;. Their first single, &quot;Love and Other Bruises&quot;, became a success.
In 1976, after opening for Rod Stewart in Australia and also in the United States in 1977, Air Supply went on tour and two more hit records ensued, &quot;Lost in Love&quot; and &quot;All Out of Love&quot;.

In 1979, Clive Davis heard the song &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, and the band signed to the label Arista Records. The first single on the Hot 100, &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, reached the top 3 in May 1980, and Graham Russell&#x27;s &quot;The One That You Love&quot; reached the top in July 1981.

== Personal life ==
In 1967, Russell married a high school sweetheart, Linda, and had a son with her the following year, Simon. Russell and Linda also had a daughter, Samantha, born in March 1972. Russell&#x27;s marriage to Linda ended in 1978.

In 1981, Russell met Jodi Varble at a show and, after two years in which they exchanged correspondence only, became a couple and married in 1986, when Varble was 21 and Russell was 36. She appears as his love interest in the first music video released for the single &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;.

In 1983, Russell and Hitchcock moved to the US as members of Air Supply. Russell currently lives in Park City, Utah.

<text>Russell Charles Hitchcock (born 15 June 1949) is an Australian musician and lead vocalist of the soft rock duo Air Supply.

==Early life==
Born in Melbourne, Hitchcock attended South Brunswick State School, and later studied at Princes Hill High School in Carlton North. In 1965, he left school to work as a salesman. At that time, he played the drums and was the lead vocalist in a band called &quot;19th Generation&quot;. At the age of 20, Hitchcock obtained a job at a computer company where he continued work for three years, before being promoted and transferred to Sydney.

==Career==
Hitchcock met British musician Graham Russell in 1975 on the set of a production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, and Air Supply was formed. The group went on to have many hit records from 1976 into the 1990s; among their biggest hits are &quot;All Out of Love&quot;, &quot;The One That You Love&quot;, &quot;Here I Am&quot;, &quot;Lost in Love&quot; and &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;.

After the band took a break in 1987, Hitchcock released several solo singles followed by his self-titled solo debut album in 1988. In 1990, the single &quot;Swear to Your Heart&quot; was released, which is from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;.

In 1991, Air Supply made a comeback with the album &quot;The Earth Is ...&quot; featuring the singles &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Stronger Than the Night&quot;. In 1995, Hitchcock recorded a duet, &quot;Is It You&quot;, with Rita Coolidge from her album &quot;Behind the Memories&quot;.

<text>Mahasiddha (Sanskrit: &quot;mahāsiddha&quot; &quot;great adept; ) is a term for someone who embodies and cultivates the &quot;siddhi of perfection&quot;. A siddha is an individual who, through the practice of sādhanā, attains the realization of siddhis, psychic and spiritual abilities and powers.

Mahasiddhas were practitioners of yoga and tantra, or &quot;tantrika&quot;s. Their historical influence throughout the Indian subcontinent and the Himalayas was vast and they reached mythic proportions as codified in their songs of realization and hagiographies, or namtars, many of which have been preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. The Mahasiddhas are identified as founders of Vajrayana traditions and lineages such as Dzogchen and Mahamudra, as well as among Bön, Nāth, and Tamil siddhars, with the same Mahasiddha sometimes serving simultaneously as a founding figure for different traditions.

Robert Thurman explains the symbiotic relationship between Tantric Buddhist communities and the Buddhist universities such as Nalanda which flourished at the same time.

==Genealogy and historical dates==
The exact genealogy and historical dates of the Mahasiddhas are contentious. As Jackson notes, &quot;despite their importance and influence, the siddhas ... remain profoundly elusive, especially to the historian. We don’t know exactly who they were, what religious allegiance they claimed, where or when—or even if—they lived, or how many of the works attributed to them really are theirs&quot;. Comparing Abhayadattaśrī&#x27;s and Ratnākaragupta&#x27;s Vajrāsana lists of the 84 siddhas, Lopez found that only 34 names are held in common. Dowman (1986) holds that they all lived between 750 and 1150 CE.

==Primary tradition==


Abhayadatta Sri is an Indian scholar of the 12th century who is claimed to have recorded the hagiographies of the eighty-four siddhas in a text known as &quot;The History of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Caturasitisiddha pravrtti&quot;; ).

Dowman holds that the eighty-four Mahasiddha are spiritual archetypes:

Reynolds (2007) states that the mahasiddha tradition &quot;evolved in North India in the early Medieval Period (3–13 cen. CE). Philosophically this movement was based on the insights revealed in the Mahayana Sutras and as systematized in the Madhyamaka and Chittamatrin schools of philosophy, but the methods of meditation and practice were radically different than anything seen in the monasteries. He proffers that the mahasiddha tradition &quot;broke with the conventions of Buddhist monastic life of the time, and abandoning the monastery they practiced in the caves, the forests, and the country villages of Northern India. In complete contrast to the settled monastic establishment of their day, which concentrated the Buddhist intelligenzia [&quot;sic.&quot;] in a limited number of large monastic universities, they adopted the life-style of itinerant mendicants, much as the wandering Sadhus of modern India.&quot;

The charnel ground conveys how great mahasiddhas in the Nath and Vajrayana traditions such as Tilopa (988–1069) and Gorakshanath (fl. 11th – 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit:
In his study of the Hevajra Tantra, David Snellgrove outlines the typical tantric siddha or yogi. After experiencing the consummation of enlightenment in the embrace of a female consort:
Thereafter the pupil is free to pursue the practice of strenuous meditation and physical self-control, and after five years or more he will perhaps succeed. He receives the five symbolic adornments, crown, ear-rings, necklace, bracelets, girdle, signs of his success. These he wears on those set occasions, the eighth or fifteenth day of the dark-fortnight, when perfected yogins and yoginis come together, to consume the flesh and wine, to sing and dance, and realize their consummation of bliss. He is free from all conventions and wanders as he pleases, knowing no distinction between friend or foe, clean or unclean, good or evil.

==Other traditions==
According to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. In many instances more than one siddha with the same name exists, so it must be assumed that fewer than thirty siddhas of the two traditions actually relate to the same historical persons. In the days when the siddhas of the later Tibetan traditions flourished in India (i.e., between the 9th and 11th centuries), it was not uncommon for initiates to assume the names of famous adepts of the past. Sometimes a disciple would have the same name as his guru, while still other names were based on caste or tribe. In such a context the distinction between siddhas of the same name becomes blurred. The entire process of distinguishing between siddhas with the same name of different texts and lineages is therefore to large extent guesswork. The great variation in phonetic transcription of Indian words into Tibetan may partly be the result of various Tibetan dialects. In the process of copying the Tibetan transcriptions in later times, the spelling often became corrupted to such an extent that the recognition or reconstitution of the original names became all but impossible. Whatever the reasons might be, the Tibetan transcription of Indian names of mahasiddhas clearly becomes more and more corrupt as time passes.

==Geographical sites==
Local folk tradition refers to a number of icons and sacred sites to the eighty-four Mahasiddha at Bharmour (formerly known as Brahmapura) in the Chaurasi complex. The word &quot;chaurasi&quot; means &quot;eighty-four&quot;.

A number of archaeological sacred sites require iconographic analysis in the Chaurasi complex in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. Although it might be hagiographical accretion and folk lore, it is said that in the reign of Sahil Varman:

==Caturāsiti-siddha-pravrtti==

The &quot;Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti&quot; (CSP), “The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas”, compiled by Abhayadatta Sri, a Northern Indian Sanskrit text dating from the 11th or 12th century, comes from a tradition prevalent in the ancient city-state of Campa in the modern state of Bihar. Only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text seem to have survived. This text was translated into Tibetan by sMon grub Shes rab and is known as the &quot;Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi’i lo rgyus&quot; or “The Legends of the Eighty-four Siddhas”. It has been suggested that Abhayadatta Sri is identical with the great Indian scholar Mahapandita Abhayakaragupta (late 11th–early 12th century), the compiler of the iconographic compendiums &quot;Vajravali&quot;, &quot;Nispannayogavali&quot;, and &quot;Jyotirmanjari&quot;.

The other major Tibetan tradition is based on the list contained in the &quot;Caturasiti-siddhabhyarthana&quot; (CSA) by Ratnakaragupta of Vajrasana, identical with Bodhgaya (Tib.: rDo rje gdan) located in Bihar, Northern India. The Tibetan translation is known as &quot;Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi’i gsol ’debs &quot; by rDo rje gdan pa. There exist several Tibetan versions of the list of mahasiddhas based on the Vajrasana text. However, these Tibetan texts differ in many cases with regard to the Tibetan transcriptions of the Indian mahasiddhas names.

==Eighty-Four Mahasiddhas==

By convention there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas in both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, with some overlap between the two lists. The number is congruent with the number of siddhi or occult powers held in the Indian Religions. In Tibetan Buddhist art they are often depicted together as a matched set in works such as thangka paintings where they may be used collectively as border decorations around a central figure.

Each Mahasiddha has come to be known for certain characteristics and teachings, which facilitates their pedagogical use. One of the most beloved Mahasiddhas is Virūpa, who may be taken as the patron saint of the Sakyapa sect and instituted the Lamdré (Tibetan: &quot;lam &#x27;bras&quot;) teachings. Virupa (alternate orthographies: Birwapa/Birupa) lived in 9th century India and was known for his great attainments.

Some of the methods and practices of the Mahasiddha were codified in Buddhist scriptures known as Tantras. Traditionally the ultimate source of these methods and practices is held to be the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, but often it is a transhistorical aspect of the Buddha or deity Vajradhara who reveals the Tantra in question directly to the Mahasiddha in a vision or whilst they dream or are in a trance. This form of the deity is known as a sambhogakaya manifestation.

Four of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas are women. They are:
*&quot;Manibhadra&quot;, the Perfect Wife
*&quot;Lakshmincara&quot;, The Princess of Crazy wisdom
*&quot;Mekhala&quot;, the elder of the 2 Headless Sisters
*&quot;Kanakhala&quot;, the younger of the 2 Headless Sisters
===List of the Mahasiddhas===
In Vajrayana Buddhism there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas. The list (in alphabetical order) below includes their name and their epithet. An asterisk after their name denotes a female Mahasiddha.

Many Mahasiddhas practiced specific tantras, for example Brahman Kukkuripa (34th in Abhyadatta&#x27;s list) of Kapilaśakru practiced Cakrasaṃvara Tantra, Monk Virūpa (3) of Somapuri practiced Hevajra for 12 years, Monk Karṇaripa (Aryadeva) (18) of Nālandā practiced Guhyasamāja.

===Names according to the Abhayadatta Sri tradition===
According to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. It is therefore also wrong to state that in Buddhism are 84 Mahasiddhas. The correct title should therefore be &quot;Names of the 84 Mahasiddhas according to the Abhayadatta Sri Tradition&quot;. It should also be clearly stated that only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text &quot;Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti&quot; (CSP) or &quot;The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas&quot; seem to have survived. This means that many Sanskrit names of the Abhayadatta Sri tradition had to be reconstructed and perhaps not always correctly.

===Identification===
According to Ulrich von Schroeder for the identification of Mahasiddhas inscribed with Tibetan names it is necessary to reconstruct the Indian names. This is a very difficult task because the Tibetans are very inconsistent with the transcription or translation of Indian personal names and therefore many different spellings do exist. When comparing the different Tibetan texts on mahasiddhas, we can see that the transcription or translation of the names of the Indian masters into the Tibetan language was inconsistent and confused. The most unsettling example is an illustrated Tibetan block print from Mongolia about the mahasiddhas, where the spellings in the text vary greatly from the captions of the xylographs. To quote a few examples: Kankaripa [Skt.] is named Kam ka li/Kangga la pa; Goraksa [Skt.]: Go ra kha/Gau raksi; Tilopa [Skt.]: Ti la blo ba/Ti lla pa; Dukhandi [Skt.]: Dha khan dhi pa/Dwa kanti; Dhobipa [Skt.]: Tom bhi pa/Dhu pi ra; Dengipa (CSP 31): Deng gi pa / Tinggi pa; Dhokaripa [Skt.]: Dho ka ra / Dhe ki ri pa; Carbaripa (Carpati) [Skt.]: Tsa ba ri pa/Tsa rwa ti pa; Sakara [Skt.]: Phu rtsas ga’/Ka ra pa; Putalipa [Skt.]: Pu ta la/Bu ta li, etc. In the same illustrated Tibetan text we find another inconsistency: the alternate use of transcription and translation. Examples are Nagarjuna [Skt.]: Na ga’i dzu na/Klu sgrub; Aryadeva (Karnaripa) [Skt.]: Ka na ri pa/’Phags pa lha; and Ghantapa [Skt.]: Ghanda pa/rDo rje dril bu pa, to name a few.

===Concordance lists===
For the identification of individual mahasiddhas the concordance lists published by Ulrich von Schroeder are useful tools for every scholar. The purpose of the concordance lists published in the appendices of his book is primarily for the reconstitution of the Indian names, regardless of whether they actually represent the same historical person or not. The index of his book contains more than 1000 different Tibetan spellings of mahasiddha names.

==Tibetan mahasiddhas==
Tibetan Buddhist masters of various lineages are often referred to as mahasiddhas (&quot;grub thob chen po&quot; or &quot;tul shug&quot;). There is a long tradition of hagiographies of these Tibetan adepts, called &quot;namtar&quot;. Their deeds were first documented in the 12th century in the Vajryana text &quot;Caturasitisiddha - pravrtti&quot;.

Important Tibetan mahasiddhas include:

* Padmasambhava, who is said to have brought Buddhism to Tibet and tamed the harmful spirits of Tibet, converting them to Buddhism.
* Yeshe Tsogyal, Padmasambhava&#x27;s consort 
* Marpa the translator (1012–1097), a lay scholar-yogi who is a key figure in the Kagyu lineage
* Machig Labdrön (1055-1149), a female mahasiddha, the founding figure of the Chöd (Wylie: &quot;gcod&quot;) lineage. 
* Milarepa (c. 11th - 12th century), a wilderness yogi, one of the most revered figures in Tibetan Buddhism
* Longchenpa, a key figure of the Nyingma school
* Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of what became the Gelug school
* Thangtong Gyalpo
* Drukpa Kunley
* Tsangnyön Heruka &quot;The Madman Heruka from Tsang&quot;, (1452-1507)
* Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851)
* Jigme Lingpa, an important terton (treasure revealer)

<doc id="553905" wikidata="Q4215408" url="?curid=553905" title="Lost in Love (Air Supply song)">
<text>&quot;Lost in Love&quot; is a song recorded by the British/Australian soft rock duo Air Supply. The song was written by group member Graham Russell. The original version of the song appeared on the &quot;Life Support&quot; album in 1979 and was released as a single in Australia, reaching number 13 on the Kent Music Report. The song was remixed for the album of the same name in 1980 and this version was released as a single in the US, reaching number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The song reportedly took Russell just 15 minutes to write and the single was made in a single afternoon. It was among the first he wrote after returning to Australia from touring with Rod Stewart, yet found little work upon his return. Despite being short of money, Russell went on a retreat to South Australia, where he felt the solitude would help him to write new material.

Air Supply&#x27;s popularity in their native country during the mid to late 1970s had not been matched elsewhere. Russell travelled to England in 1979, and while there, discovered that the group&#x27;s Australian record label Big Time Records had sold &quot;Lost in Love&quot; to Arista Records in the United States for distribution. Soon thereafter, their song became a hit on the music charts in the US.

&quot;Cashbox&quot; described it as &quot;soft rock, with elegant acoustic guitar work, glistening harmonies, light rhythm and electric piano touches.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;willowy ballad,&quot; saying that &quot;the soft vocals and
smooth flow are well-suited for soft -rock fans and A/C -pop.&quot;

This song was featured in an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Emission Impossible&quot;, the 1981 American film &quot;Private Lessons&quot;, and the Australian film &quot;Hotel de Love&quot;.

==Personnel==
*Russell Hitchcock – vocals

==Chart performance==
Within six weeks after its release, the song made it to the top 40 and was in the top 10 seven weeks after that. It spent four weeks at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in May 1980 and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart for six weeks that same year.

== Music videos ==
There are two music videos for &quot;Lost in Love&quot;. One, an official video, has Air Supply singing on a blue background, while their entire band of additional personnel play their music for them. The other one has Air Supply singing live at a concert.

==Early life and education==
Tyner was born on December 11, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the eldest of Jarvis and Beatrice (née Stevenson) Tyner&#x27;s three children.

Tyner was encouraged to study piano by his mother, who had installed a piano at her beauty salon. When he was 13, Tyner began piano lessons at Granoff School of Music, where he also studied music theory and harmony. By the time he was 15, music had become the focus of his life.

Tyner&#x27;s decision to study piano was reinforced when he encountered bebop pianist Bud Powell, a neighbor of the Tyner family. Another major influence on Tyner&#x27;s playing was Thelonious Monk, whose percussive attacks informed Tyner&#x27;s style. During his teens, Tyner led his own group, the Houserockers.

When he was 17, Tyner converted to Ahmadiyya and changed his name to Suleiman Saud.

==Career==

Tyner played professionally in Philadelphia, becoming part of its modern jazz scene. In 1960, he joined The Jazztet led by Benny Golson and Art Farmer. Six months later, he joined the John Coltrane quartet, which included drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Steven Davis. He worked with the band during its extended run at the Jazz Gallery, replacing Steve Kuhn. Coltrane had known Tyner for a while growing up in Philadelphia, and recorded Tyner&#x27;s composition &quot;The Believer&quot; on January 10, 1958, which became the title track of Prestige Records&#x27; 1964 album under Coltrane&#x27;s name. 

The band toured almost nonstop between 1961 and 1965, recording many albums widely considered jazz classics including &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (1961) for Atlantic Records and &quot;Coltrane &quot;Live&quot; at the Village Vanguard&quot; (1962), &quot;Ballads&quot; (1963), &quot;John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman&quot; (1963), &quot;Live at Birdland&quot; (1964), &quot;Crescent&quot; (1964), &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (1964), and &quot;The John Coltrane Quartet Plays&quot; (1965), for Impulse! Records.

While in Coltrane&#x27;s group, Tyner recorded albums in a piano trio. In late 1962 and the first half of 1963, Tyner was asked by producer Bob Thiele to record more straightforward jazz albums as a leader. These included &quot;Reaching Fourth&quot; (1963), &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1964), and &quot;McCoy Tyner Plays Ellington&quot; (1965).

In a 2017 review, Marc Myers of &quot;JazzWax&quot; wrote, &quot;the finest of these straightforward piano recordings was &quot;Nights of Ballads &amp; Blues&quot;. Tyner&#x27;s playing is exciting and exceptional on all of the tracks... On the album, he exhibits a reserved elegance and tenderness that reveals the other side of his personality—a lover of melody and standards. In this regard, there are traces of Oscar Peterson in his playing. Perhaps Thiele was using Tyner to take a bite out of Peterson&#x27;s vast and successful early-&#x27;60s share of the jazz market.&quot;

Tyner also appeared as a sideman on many Blue Note Records albums of the 1960s, although he was often credited as &quot;etc.&quot; on the cover of these albums to respect his contract with Impulse!.

Tyner&#x27;s playing style developed in close contact with Coltrane. His style is comparable to Coltrane&#x27;s maximalist style. In 2019, Sami Linna at the University of the Arts Helsinki noted that Coltrane described the two different directions in his playing as &quot;playing chordally (vertically) or melodically (horizontally)&quot;. Linna suggests: &quot;Tyner would eventually find a way of dealing with the two directions simultaneously, in a manner that was supportive and complementary yet original and slightly different from Coltrane&#x27;s approach.&quot;

After 1960, Coltrane did not hire anyone as a replacement if Tyner was not available; between the time Tyner joined the group (around the end of May 1960) and left (December 1965), no other pianist accompanied Coltrane.

Tyner&#x27;s involvement with Coltrane ended in 1965. Coltrane&#x27;s music was becoming much more atonal and free; he had also augmented his quartet with percussion players who threatened to drown out both Tyner and Jones. Tyner commented: &quot;I didn&#x27;t see myself making any contribution to that music... All I could hear was a lot of noise. I didn&#x27;t have any feeling for the music, and when I don&#x27;t have feelings, I don&#x27;t play&quot;.

In 1966, Tyner rehearsed with a new trio and embarked on a career as a bandleader. Tyner produced a series of post-bop albums released by Blue Note between 1967 and 1970. These included &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; (1967), &quot;Tender Moments&quot; (1967), &quot;Time for Tyner&quot; (1968), &quot;Expansions&quot; (1968), and &quot;Extensions&quot; (1970). He signed with Milestone Records and recorded such albums as &quot;Sahara&quot; and &quot;Echoes of a Friend&quot; (1972), &quot;Enlightenment&quot; (1973), and &quot;Fly with the Wind&quot; (1976), which included flutist Hubert Laws, drummer Billy Cobham, and a string orchestra.

His music for Blue Note and Milestone often used the music of the Coltrane quartet as a starting point. Tyner also incorporated African and East Asian elements. On &quot;Sahara&quot;, he played &quot;koto&quot; in addition to piano, flute, and percussion. These albums have been cited as examples of innovative 1970s jazz that was neither fusion nor free jazz. On &quot;Trident&quot; (1975) Tyner played the harpsichord and celesta, instruments rarely heard in jazz. Unlike many jazz keyboardists of his generation, Tyner rarely used electronic keyboards or synthesizers.

During the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, Tyner performed in a trio including Avery Sharpe on bass and Louis Hayes, then Aaron Scott, on drums. He also recorded some solo albums for Blue Note, beginning with &quot;Revelations&quot; (1988) and culminating in &quot;Soliloquy&quot; (1991).
After signing with Telarc, he recorded with several other trios. These included Charnett Moffett on bass and Al Foster on drums. In 2008, he toured with a quartet of Gary Bartz, Gerald L. Cannon, and Eric Gravatt.

==Personal life==
Tyner married Aisha Saud; they had three sons. The marriage ended in divorce.

Tyner&#x27;s younger brother Jarvis Tyner was executive vice-chairman of the Communist Party USA.

==Death==
Tyner died at his home in Bergenfield, New Jersey, on March 6, 2020. He was 81. No cause of death was given, but he had been in ill health.

==Influence and playing style==
Tyner is considered one of the most influential jazz pianists of the late 20th century, an honor he earned during and after his time with Coltrane.

Tyner, who was left-handed, played with a low bass left hand and raised his arm high above the keyboard for an emphatic attack. His right-hand soloing was detached and staccato. His melodic vocabulary was rich, ranging from raw blues to complex superimposed pentatonic scales; his approach to chord voicing (most characteristically by fourths) influenced contemporary jazz pianists, such as Chick Corea. Some of his harmonic modal techniques have been connected to Claude Debussy&#x27;s music.

Bob Weir, rhythm guitarist for the Grateful Dead, has cited Tyner as an influence on his playing.

== Awards and honors ==
Tyner was named a 2002 NEA Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts. He won five Grammy Awards: for &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1992) and &quot;Journey&quot; (1993) and best instrumental jazz album for &quot;Illuminations&quot; (2004), &quot;Infinity&quot; (1995), and &quot;Blues for Coltrane: A Tribute to John Coltrane&quot; (1987).

Tyner was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music at the Sala dei Notari during the Umbria Jazz Festival. Tyner was a judge for the 6th, 10th and 11th annual Independent Music Awards.

<text>In mathematics, a subsequential limit of a sequence is the limit of some subsequence. Every subsequential limit is a cluster point, but not conversely. In first-countable spaces, the two concepts coincide.

In a topological space, if every subsequence has a subsequential limit to the same point, then the original sequence also converges to that limit. This need not hold in more generalized notions of convergence, such as the space of almost everywhere convergence.

The supremum of the set of all subsequential limits of some sequence is called the limit superior, or limsup. Similarly, the infimum of such a set is called the limit inferior, or liminf. See limit superior and limit inferior.

If formula_1 is a metric space and there is a Cauchy sequence such that there is a subsequence converging to some formula_2 then the sequence also converges to formula_3

<doc id="553922" wikidata="Q210567" url="?curid=553922" title="Symphony No. 2 (Shostakovich)">
<text>Dmitri Shostakovich wrote his Symphony No. 2 in B major, Op. 14, subtitled To October, for the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. It was first performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy Capella Choir under Nikolai Malko, on 5 November 1927. After the premiere, Shostakovich made some revisions to the score, and this final version was first played in Moscow later in 1927 under the baton of Konstantin Saradzhev. It was also the first time any version of the work had been played in Moscow.

Shostakovich later revisited the events of the October Revolution in his Twelfth Symphony, subtitled &quot;The Year 1917&quot;.

==Structure==
The symphony is a short (about 20 minutes) experimental work in one movement; within this movement are four sections, the last of which includes a chorus. In a marked departure from his First Symphony, Shostakovich composed his Second in a gestural, geometric &quot;music without emotional structure&quot; manner, with the intent of reflecting speech patterns and physical movements in a neo-realistic style. This choice may have been influenced at least partially by Vsevolod Meyerhold&#x27;s theory of biomechanics.
Shostakovich placed far more emphasis on texture in this work than he did on thematic material. He quickly adds sonorities and layers of sound in a manner akin to Abstract Expressionism instead of focusing on contrapuntal clarity. While much of the symphony consequently consists of sound effects rather than music, the work possesses an unquestionable vitality and incorporates the basic elements of the musical language he used in the rest of his career.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for mixed choir (in the final part) and orchestra of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, glockenspiel, (factory) siren, and strings.

==Overview==
Shostakovich&#x27;s Second and Third Symphonies have often been criticized for incongruities in their experimental orchestral sections and more conventionally agitprop choral finales. In the Soviet Union they were considered experiments, and since the days of Stalin the term &quot;experiment&quot; was not considered positive. Much later, Shostakovich admitted that out of his 15 symphonies, &quot;two, I suppose, are completely unsatisfactory – that&#x27;s the Second and Third.&quot; He also rejected his early experimental writing in general as &quot;erroneous striving after originality&quot; [the piano cycle &quot;Aphorisms&quot;] and &quot;infants&#x27; diseases&quot; [the Second and Third Symphonies].

The Second Symphony was commissioned to include a poem by Alexander Bezymensky, which glorified Lenin&#x27;s role in the proletarian struggle. The cult of Lenin, imposed from the upper echelons of the Party, grew to gigantic proportions in the years immediately following his death. The work was initially titled &quot;To October&quot;. It was referred to as a &quot;Symphonic Poem&quot; and &quot;Symphonic Dedication to October&quot;. It became &quot;To October, a Symphonic Dedication&quot; when the work was published in 1927. It only became known as a &quot;symphony&quot; considerably later.

===Composition===
Shostakovich was commissioned by Lev Shuglin, a Bolshevik and head of the Propaganda Department of the State Music Publishing House (Muzsektor), to write a large orchestral work with a choral finale called &quot;Dedication to October&quot; to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. Shuglin suggested the use of a factory whistle to open the choral finale. The composer wrote to Sergei Protopopov on 20 February 1927 that he was unsure his music could redeem the text, which he described as &quot;repulsive&quot;. 

Part of the problem Shostakovich had in writing the symphony was that people expected a successor to his First Symphony, and he no longer believed in writing in the same compositional style. He also had other projects toward which he wanted to direct his attention as soon as possible, and the First Symphony had taken him nearly a year to write. As it turned out, the Commissariat for Enlightenment&#x27;s propaganda department, Agitotdel, regularly commissioned single-movement works on topical subjects. These works often featured revolutionary tunes and invariably employed sung texts to make the required meaning clear. Furthermore, because of the non-musical orientation of potential audiences, these pieces were not expected to last more than 15 or 20 minutes at most.

Though Shostakovich had been commissioned by Muzsektor rather than Agitotdel, and was thus expected to produce a composition of abstract music instead of a propaganda piece, writing a short agitprop symphony seemed to solve all of Shostakovich&#x27;s problems. Such a work was entirely appropriate for the occasion for which it was being written. It would also be impossible for Muzsektor to turn it down, and was guaranteed at least some friendly press. It also sidestepped the stylistic problem of producing a sequel to the First Symphony while also opening the door to experiment with orchestral effects in an entirely new vein. Most importantly for Shostakovich, the piece took little time to compose, allowing him to return to other projects at his earliest convenience.

The choral section gave the composer particular trouble. Shostakovich told Yavorsky confidentially, &quot;I&#x27;m composing the chorus with great difficulty. The words!!!!&quot; Solomon Volkov said of it that &quot;one is tempted simply to cut it off with a pair of scissors&quot;.

====Chorus: &quot;To October&quot;====
:&quot;Text by Alexander Bezymensky&quot;
&lt;poem lang=&quot;ru&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Russian
Мы шли, мы просили работы и хлеба,
Сердца были сжаты тисками тоски.
Заводские трубы тянулися к небу,
Как руки, бессильные сжать кулаки.
Страшно было имя наших тенет:
Молчанье, страданье, гнет.

Но громче орудий ворвались в молчанье
Слова нашей скорби, слова наших мук.
О Ленин! Ты выковал волю страданья,
Ты выковал волю мозолистых рук.
Мы поняли, Ленин, что наша судьба
Носит имя: борьба.

Борьба! Ты вела нас к последнему бою.
Борьба! Ты дала нам победу Труда.
И этой победы над гнетом и тьмою
Никто не отнимет у нас никогда.
Пусть каждый в борьбе будет молод и храбр:
Ведь имя победы – Октябрь!

Октябрь! – это солнца желанного вестник.
Октябрь! – это воля восставших веков.
Октябрь! – это труд, это радость и песня.
Октябрь! – это счастье полей и станков.
Вот знамя, вот имя живых поколений:
Октябрь, Коммуна и Ленин.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Translation
We marched, we asked for work and bread.
Our hearts were gripped in a vice of anguish.
Factory chimneys towered up towards the sky
Like hands, powerless to clench a fist.
Terrible were the names of our shackles:
Silence, suffering, oppression.

But louder than gunfire there burst into the silence
Words of our torment, words of our suffering.
Oh, Lenin! You forged freedom through suffering,
You forged freedom from our toil-hardened hands.
We knew, Lenin, that our fate
Bears a name: Struggle.

Struggle! You led us to the final battle.
Struggle! You gave us the victory of Labour.
And this victory over oppression and darkness
None can ever take away from us!
Let all in the struggle be young and bold:
The name of this victory is October!

October! The messenger of the awaited dawn.
October! The freedom of rebellious ages.
October! Labour, joy and song.
October! Happiness in the fields and at the work benches,
This is the slogan and this is the name of living generations:
October, the Commune and Lenin.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Reception===

In the West, listeners appreciated the orchestral section but not the choral emotionalism that followed. While some Soviet critics acclaimed it at the time of the premiere, the Second Symphony did not attain lasting success.

<doc id="553927" wikidata="Q1162164" url="?curid=553927" title="Clubfoot">
<text>Clubfoot is a congenital or acquired defect where one or both feet are rotated inward and downward. Congenital clubfoot is the most common congenital malformation of the foot with an incidence of 1 per 1000 births. In approximately 50% of cases, clubfoot affects both feet, but it can present unilaterally causing one leg or foot to be shorter than the other. Most of the time, it is not associated with other problems. Without appropriate treatment, the foot deformity will persist and lead to pain and impaired ability to walk, which can have a dramatic impact on the quality of life.
The exact cause is usually not identified. Both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved. There are two main types of congenital clubfoot: idiopathic (80% of cases) and secondary clubfoot (20% of cases). The idiopathic congenital clubfoot is a multifactorial condition that includes environmental, vascular, positional, and genetic factors. There appears to be hereditary component for this birth defect given that the risk of developing congenital clubfoot is 25% when a first-degree relative is affected. In addition, if one identical twin is affected, there is a 33% chance the other one will be as well. The underlying mechanism involves disruption of the muscles or connective tissue of the lower leg, leading to joint contracture. Other abnormalities are associated 20% of the time, with the most common being distal arthrogryposis and myelomeningocele. The diagnosis may be made at birth by physical examination or before birth during an ultrasound exam.
The most common initial treatment is the Ponseti method, which is divided into two phases: 1) correcting of foot position and 2) casting at repeated weekly intervals. If the clubfoot deformity does not improve by the end of the casting phase, an Achilles tendon tenotomy can be performed. The procedure consists of a small posterior skin incision through which the tendon cut is made. In order to maintain the correct position of the foot, it is necessary to wear an orthopedic brace until 5 years of age.

Initially, the brace is worn nearly continuously and then just at night. In about 20% of cases, further surgery is required. Treatment can be carried out by a range of healthcare providers and can generally be achieved in the developing world with few resources.
Congenital clubfoot occurs in 1 to 4 of every 1,000 live births, making it one of the most common birth defects affecting the legs. About 80% of cases occur in developing countries where there is limited access to care. Clubfoot is more common in firstborn children and males. It is more common among Māori people, and less common among Chinese people.

==Epidemiology==

Birth prevalence of clubfoot varies between 0.51 and 2.03/1,000 live births in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Clubfoot disproportionally affects those in LMICs. About 80% of those with clubfoot, or approximately 100,000 children per year as of 2018, are born in LMICs.

==History==
Pharaohs Siptah and Tutankhamun had clubfeet, and the condition appears in Egyptian paintings. Indian texts () and Hippocrates () describe treatment. In 1823, Delpech presented a new procedure to treat the condition. The new method, known as tenotomy, involved the cutting of the Achilles tendon. The surgical procedure had complications such as infections.

Talleyrand might have had a congenital clubfoot, which if his uncle did as well, could have been genetic. In any case, his handicap made him unable to follow his father into a military career, leaving the obvious career of the Church.

==Signs and symptoms==
In clubfoot, feet are rotated inward and downward. The affected foot and leg may be smaller than the other, while in about half of cases, clubfoot affects both feet. Most of the time clubfoot is not associated with other problems.

Clubfoot can be diagnosed by ultrasound of the fetus in more than 60% of cases. The earliest week of gestation in which the condition is diagnosed with a high degree of confidence was the 12th and the latest was the 32nd. Not all patients were diagnosed at an early stage. In 29% of fetuses the first ultrasound examination failed to detect the deformity which subsequently became obvious at a later examination. Clubfoot was diagnosed between 12 and 23 weeks of gestation in 86% of children and between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation in the remaining 14%.

Without treatment the foot remains deformed and people walk on the sides or tops of their feet, which can cause calluses, foot infections, trouble fitting into shoes, pain, difficulty walking, and disability.

==Causes==
Hypotheses about the precise cause of clubfoot vary. However, research has found that genetics, environmental factors or a combination of both are associated with this condition. Evidence suggests that the etiology of clubfoot is most likely multifactorial. A meta-analysis and systematic review found that the most clinically relevant risk factors for clubfoot were family history, paternal and maternal smoking, maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, amniocentesis, and the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Many findings agree that &quot;it is likely there is more than one different cause and at least in some cases the phenotype may occur as a result of a threshold effect of different factors acting together.&quot; The most commonly associated conditions are distal arthrogryposis or myelomeningocele. The factors contributing to the development of clubfoot can be categorized as extrinsic and intrinsic factors.

Extrinsic factors

Factors that can influence the positioning of the fetal foot in utero include oligohydramnios, breech presentation, Müllerian anomalies, multiple gestation, amniotic band sequence, or amniocentesis at &lt;15 weeks of gestation. In cases that impede normal growth and position for longstanding period of times, clubfoot can be accompanied with other deformations and may be associated with developmental hip dysplasia. The theory of fetal growth arrest was proposed by Von Volkmann in 1863, and has been verified by other authors since. According to this theory, intrinsic errors or environmental insults during gestation prevents the correction of an equinovarus to pronated foot. Other researchers hypothesize that clubfoot may derive from external insults during gestation. For example, a research study found an alarmingly high incidence of club foot and limb contractures associated with iatrogenic amniotic leakage caused by early amniocentesis between the 11th and 12th week of gestation.

Intrinsic factors

* &quot;Chromosomal abnormalities&quot; found in 30% and 2% of complex clubfoot and isolated clubfoot respectively. These include trisomy 18, 13, 21, sex chromosome abnormalities, micro-deletions and duplications.
* &quot;Genetic Syndromes:&quot; Larsen, Gordon, Pierre-Robin, Meckel–Gruber, Roberts, Smith–Lemli–Opitz, TARP (Talipes equinovarus, Atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, Persistence of left superior vena cava).
* &quot;Skeletal Dysplasias:&quot; Ellis van Creveld syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia, chondrodysplasia punctata, camptomelic dysplasia, atelosteogenesis, and mesomelic dysplasia.
* &quot;Neuromuscular and Neurologic abnormalities:&quot; arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, neural tube defects, holoprosencephaly, and hydranencephaly.

==Genetics==
Clubfoot can be diagnosed prenatally as early as 13 weeks of gestation via ultrasound. According to the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a diagnostic testing for genetic causes is recommended when clubfoot is diagnosed prenatally. If prenatal screening is suspicious for aneuploidy, karyotype analysis or chromosomal microarray (CMA) may be performed. However, if patients decline diagnostic testing, Cell-Free DNA is another screening option to identify high-risk pregnancies for aneuploidy and it is not diagnostic. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of clubfoot is relatively low. Overall, fetal ultrasound should be performed with a prenatal diagnosis of clubfoot in order to classify the condition as either complex or isolated because of the significant differences in rates of chromosomal abnormalities and outcomes between these two groups.

If one identical twin is affected, there is a 33% chance the other one will be as well.

Mutations in genes involved in muscle development are risk factors for clubfoot, specifically those encoding the muscle contractile complex (&quot;MYH3&quot;, &quot;TPM2&quot;, &quot;TNNT3&quot;, &quot;TNNI2&quot; and &quot;MYH8&quot;). These can cause congenital contractures, including clubfoot, in distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes. Clubfoot can also be present in people with genetic conditions such as Loeys–Dietz syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

Genetic mapping and the development of models of the disease have improved understanding of developmental processes. Its inheritance pattern is explained as a heterogenous disorder using a polygenic threshold model. The PITX1-TBX4 transcriptional pathway has become key to the study of clubfoot. PITX1 and TBX4 are uniquely expressed in the hind limb.

==Diagnosis==
Clubfoot is diagnosed through physical examination. Typically, babies are examined from head-to-toe shortly after they are born. There are four components of the clubfoot deformity:
Factors used to assess severity include the stiffness of the deformity (how much it can be corrected by manually manipulating the foot), the presence of skin creases at the arch and heel, and poor muscle consistency.

Sometimes, it is possible to detect clubfoot before birth using ultrasound. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound can allow parents to learn more about this condition and plan ahead for treatment after their baby is born.

More testing and imaging is typically not needed, unless there is concern for other associated conditions.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is usually with some combination of the Ponseti method and French method. The Ponseti method involves a combination of casting, Achilles tendon release, and bracing. There are many commercial braces as well as a relatively inexpensive open-source hardware brace that can be made with a 3D printer. The Ponseti method is widely used and highly effective under the age of two. The French method involves realignment, taping, and long-term home exercises and night splinting. It is also effective but outcomes vary and rely on heavy involvement of caregivers. Generally, the Ponseti method is preferred. Another technique, the Kite method, does not appear to be as effective. In about 20% of cases, additional surgery is required after initial treatment.

=== Ponseti method ===
The Ponseti method corrects clubfoot over the course of several stages.
* Serial casting: First, the foot is manually manipulated into an improved position and held in place with a long leg cast which extends from the toes up to the thigh. After a week this cast is removed, the foot is re-manipulated, and placed into a new cast. This process repeats and the foot is gradually reshaped over the course of 4-6 serial casts, although some feet may require additional casts.
** The goal of the initial cast is to align the forefoot with the hindfoot. Ponseti describes the forefoot as pronated in relation to the hindfoot, so supinating the forefoot and elevating the first metatarsal improves this alignment.
** Subsequent casts are applied after stretching the foot with a focus on abducting the forefoot with lateral pressure at the talus, to bring the navicular laterally and improve the alignment of the talonavicular joint. In contrast to the Kite method of casting, it is important to avoid constraining the calcaneocuboid joint. With each additional cast, the abduction is increased and this moves the hindfoot from varus into valgus. It is important to leave the ankle in equinus until the forefoot and hindfoot are corrected.
** The final stage of casting is to correct the equinus. After fully abducting the forefoot with spontaneous correction of the hindfoot, an attempt is made to bring the ankle up and into dorsiflexion. The foot must have the ability to dorsiflex to at least 10 degrees past 0 (neutral, or L position), although 15 degrees or more is better and preferred. If the foot can not dorsiflex enough, the brace will not work/be tolerated. If it is determined the foot can not dorsiflex at least 10 degrees, the Achilles Tenotomy surgical procedure is performed.
* Achilles tendon release: At the end of the serial casting, most children have corrected cavus, adductus and varus deformities, but continue to have equinus deformity. To correct this, a procedure called an Achilles tendon release (commonly called Achilles tenotomy) is performed. Before the procedure, many centers place the child under sedation or monitored anesthesia care, although Ponseti recommended using local anesthetic alone. Next, the area around the heel is cleansed and numbed, and a small scalpel is used to cut the Achilles tendon. The incision is small so there is minimal bleeding and no need for stitches. The skin is covered with a small dressing, and the foot is placed into a final long leg cast in a fully corrected position. This cast is typically left in place for three weeks. During this time, the Achilles tendon will regrow in a lengthened position.
* Bracing: After successful correction is achieved through serial casting and Achilles tenotomy, the foot must be kept in a brace to prevent it from returning to the deformed position over the first few years of a child&#x27;s life. The brace is made up of two shoes or boots that are connected to each other by a bar that is bent under the shoes at 10–15 degrees, or curved to create 10–15 degrees dorsiflexion. This device is also called a foot abduction brace (FAB) or more generally boots and bar (BnB). At first, the brace is worn full-time (23 hours per day) on both feet, regardless of whether the clubfoot affects one or two feet. After 3 months of 23/7 wear, the brace is worn less frequently by gradually reducing hours a couple at a time, every couple months so that hours are down to 12–14 per day at or around a year old. From this point on until at least 4–5 years, or even longer (6–9 years if needed), the brace is worn mostly while sleeping at night and during naps (12–14 hours per day). Bracing is essential in preventing recurrence of the deformity and is a major determinant of a child&#x27;s long-term outcome.

The Ponseti method is highly effective with short-term success rates of 90%. However, anywhere from 14% to 41% of children experience a recurrence of the deformity, with as many as 56% requiring an additional surgery beyond the 10 year mark. The most common reason for this is inadequate adherence to bracing, such as not wearing the brace properly, not keeping it on for the recommended length of time, or not using it every day. Children who do not follow proper bracing protocol have up to seven times higher recurrence rates than those who follow bracing protocol, as the muscles around the foot can pull it back into the abnormal position. Low parental education level and failure to understand the importance of bracing is a major contributor to non-adherence. Relapses are managed by repeating the casting process. Relapsed feet may also require additional, more extensive surgeries and have a reduced chance of achieving subsequent correction. Furthermore, research has revealed the possibility of overcorrection after use of the Ponseti method.

Another reason for recurrence is a congenital muscle imbalance between the muscles that invert the ankle (tibialis posterior and tibialis anterior muscles) and the muscles that evert the ankle (peroneal muscles). This imbalance is present in approximately 20% of infants successfully treated with the Ponseti casting method, and makes them more prone to recurrence. This relapse is usually treated with Ponseti casting and can be done multiple times before resorting to surgery. If after all non-surgical casting and bracing options have been exhausted, and when the child is over four years of age (many doctors prefer to wait until after seven years old), this can be addressed with a surgery to transfer the tibialis anterior tendon from its medial attachment (on the navicula) to a more lateral position (on the lateral cuneiform). The surgery requires general anesthesia and subsequent casting while the tendon heals, but it is a relatively minor surgery that re-balances the muscles of the foot without disturbing any joints.

The impact of Ponsetti management of clubfoot on mothers and caregivers has also been researched with studies finding mother&#x27;s caring for children with congenital club foot report significantly lower levels of psychological health than mothers of health infants.

===French method===
The French method is a conservative, non-operative method of clubfoot treatment that involves daily physical therapy for the first two months followed by thrice-weekly physical therapy for the next four months and continued home exercises following the conclusion of formal physical therapy. During each physical therapy session the feet are manipulated, stretched, then taped to maintain any gains made to the feet&#x27;s range of motion. Exercises may focus on strengthening the peroneal muscles, which is thought to contribute to long-term correction. After the two month mark, the frequency of physical therapy sessions can be weaned down to three times a week instead of daily, until the child reaches six months. After the conclusion of the physical therapy program, caregivers must continue performing exercises at home and splinting at night in order to maintain long-term correction.

Compared to the Ponseti method which uses rigid casts and braces, the French method uses tape which allows for some motion in the feet. Despite its goal to avoid surgery, the success rate varies and surgery may still be necessary. The Ponseti method is generally preferred over the French method.

=== Surgery ===

If non-operative treatments are unsuccessful or achieve incomplete correction of the deformity, surgery is sometimes needed. Surgery was more common prior to the widespread acceptance of the Ponseti method. The extent of surgery depends on the severity of the deformity. Usually, surgery is done at 9 to 12 months of age and the goal is to correct all the components of the clubfoot deformity at the time of surgery.

For feet with the typical components of deformity (cavus, forefoot adductus, hindfoot varus, and ankle equinus), the typical procedure is a Posteromedial Release (PMR) surgery. This is done through an incision across the medial side of the foot and ankle, that extends posteriorly, and sometimes around to the lateral side of the foot. In this procedure, it is typically necessary to release (cut) or lengthen the plantar fascia, several tendons, and joint capsules/ligaments. Typically, the important structures are exposed and then sequentially released until the foot can be brought to an appropriate plantigrade position. Specifically, it is important to bring the ankle to neutral, the heel into neutral, the midfoot aligned with the hindfoot (navicula aligned with the talus, and the cuboid aligned with the calcaneus). Once these joints can be aligned, thin wires are usually placed across these joints to hold them in the corrected position. These wires are temporary and left out through the skin for removal after 3–4 weeks. Once the joints are aligned, tendons (typically the Achilles, posterior tibialis, and flexor halluces longus) are repaired at an appropriate length. The incision (or incisions) are closed with dissolvable sutures. The foot is then casted in the corrected position for 6–8 weeks. It is common to do a cast change with anesthesia after 3–4 weeks, so that pins can be removed and a mold can be made to fabricate a custom AFO brace. The new cast is left in place until the AFO is available. When the cast is removed, the AFO is worn to prevent the foot from returning to the old position.

For feet with partial correction of deformity with non-operative treatment, surgery may be less extensive and may involve only the posterior part of the foot and ankle. This might be called a posterior release. This is done through a smaller incision and may involve releasing only the posterior capsule of the ankle and subtalar joints, along with lengthening the Achilles tendon.

Surgery leaves residual scar tissue and typically there is more stiffness and weakness than with nonsurgical treatment. As the foot grows, there is potential for asymmetric growth that can result in recurrence of foot deformity that can affect the forefoot, midfoot, or hindfoot. Many patients do fine, but some require orthotics or additional surgeries. Long-term studies of adults with post-surgical clubfeet, especially those needing multiple surgeries, show that they may not fare as well in the long term. Some people may require additional surgeries as they age, though there is some dispute as to the effectiveness of such surgeries, in light of the prevalence of scar tissue present from earlier surgeries.

===Developing world===
Despite effective treatments, children in LMICs face many barriers such as limited access to equipment (specifically casting materials and abduction braces), shortages of healthcare professionals, and low education levels and socioeconomic status amongst caregivers and families. These factors make it difficult to detect and diagnose children with clubfoot, connect them to care, and train their caregivers to follow the proper treatment and return for follow-up visits. It is estimated that only 15% of those diagnosed with clubfoot receive treatment.

In an effort to reduce the burden of clubfoot in LMICs, there have been initiatives to improve early diagnosis, organize high-volume Ponseti casting centers, utilize mid-level practitioners and non-physician health workers, engage families in care, and provide local follow-up in the person&#x27;s community.

<doc id="553934" wikidata="Q707995" url="?curid=553934" title="Seaman (rank)">
<text>Seaman is a military rank used in many navies around the world. It is considered a junior enlisted rank and, depending on the navy, it may be a single rank on its own or a name shared by several similarly junior ranks.

In the Commonwealth, it is the lowest rank in the navy, except in Canada where the Royal Canadian Navy now uses the gender-neutral title sailor in English and matelot in French. In the United States, it refers to the three lowest ranks of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. The equivalent of the seaman is the &quot;matelot&quot; in French-speaking countries, and &quot;Matrose&quot; in German-speaking countries.

== Australia ==
The Royal Australian Navy features one seaman rank, which is split into two distinct classes. Seaman and seaman* (pronounced &quot;seaman star&quot;), to differentiate between those who have completed their employment training and those who are in training. There is no insignia on a seaman rank slide.

==Canada==
There are 4 grades of sailor (previously the term &quot;seaman&quot;, until it was replaced with &quot;sailor&quot; in August 2020)/&quot;matelot&quot; in the Royal Canadian Navy:
The rank of master sailor is unique because it was created only for the Canadian Navy. It does not follow the British tradition of other Canadian ranks. It corresponds to the rank of master corporal/&quot;caporal-chef&quot;.

==France==
&quot;Matelot 2e classe&quot; (seaman 2nd class), or apprentice seaman, and &quot;matelot breveté&quot; (able seaman) are designations of the French Navy. &quot;Matelot&quot;s are colloquially known as &quot;&quot;mousse&quot;s&quot;.

== Estonia ==

&quot;Madrus&quot; is the lowest rank in the Estonian Navy. It is equivalent to OR-1 in NATO

==Germany==

The German rank of &quot;seaman&quot; () is the lowest enlisted rank of the German Navy. It is equivalent to OR1 in NATO and is a grade A3 in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence.
==Greece==

There is one grade of seaman in the Hellenic Navy.
==Indonesia==
In the Indonesian Navy, this rank is referred to as &quot;kelasi&quot;. There are three levels of this rank in the Indonesian Navy which are: &quot;seaman recruit&quot; (&quot;kelasi dua&quot;), &quot;seaman apprentice&quot; (&quot;kelasi satu&quot;), and &quot;seaman&quot; (&quot;kelasi kepala&quot;), the rating system thus mirrors the one used in the US Navy.
==Italy==
The Italian rank of &quot;seaman&quot; () is the lowest enlisted rank of the Italian Navy equivalent in NATO to OR1.
==Japan==
See Military ranks and insignia of the Japan Self-Defense Forces

==Russia==

Much Russian military vocabulary was imported, along with military advisers, from the Dutch Republic in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Russian word for &quot;seaman&quot; or &quot;sailor&quot; (; &quot;matros&quot;) was borrowed from the Dutch &quot;matroos&quot;. In Imperial Russia the most junior naval rank was &quot;seaman 2nd class&quot; (матрос 2-й статьи; &quot;matros vtoroi stati&quot;). Estonia () and Latvia () use closely related loanwords.

The 1917 Revolution led to the term &quot;Red Fleet man&quot; (краснофлотец; &quot;krasnoflotets&quot;) until 1943, when the Soviet Navy reintroduced the term &quot;seaman&quot; (матрос; &quot;matros&quot;), along with badges of rank. The Russian Federation inherited the term in 1991, as did several other former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Belarus, with Bulgaria using the same word and the same Cyrillic orthography. 
==United Kingdom==
In the Royal Navy the rate is split into two divisions: AB1 and AB2. The AB2 rating is used for those who have not yet completed their professional taskbooks. The rate of ordinary seaman has been discontinued.
==United States==

Seaman is the third enlisted rank from the bottom in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, ranking above seaman apprentice and below petty officer third class. This naval rank was formerly called seaman first class. The rank is also used in United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, a naval-themed uniformed youth program under the sponsorship of the Navy League of the United States.

The actual title and insignia for an E-3 varies based on the job rating to which the member will ultimately be assigned.

* Those in the general deck, technical, weapons and administrative groups (with the exception of the aviation administration men) are called &quot;seamen&quot; and they represent the largest group of Navy and Coast Guard personnel in pay grades E-3 and below. They wear white stripes on their blue uniforms (USN and USCG), and navy blue (black) stripes on their white uniforms (USN only).
* Those in the medical group are now called &quot;hospitalmen.&quot; In October 2005, the USN dental technician (DT) rating was merged into the hospital corpsman (HM) rating, eliminating the &quot;dentalman&quot; title for E-3 and below. Those who once held the rate of &quot;dentalman&quot; have become &quot;hospitalmen&quot;. They wear white stripes on their blue uniforms, and navy blue stripes on their white uniforms. After the completion of their &quot;A&quot; school, they wear a caduceus of the same color as the stripes on their uniforms. On their combat uniforms, a hospitalman wears their caduceus on the tab of their left collar tab. This rating was previously called pharmacist&#x27;s mate (PHM) and HMs are colloquially referred to as &quot;corpsman&quot; in the naval service. Hospitalmen exist only in the U.S. Navy; their equivalent in the U.S. Coast Guard is the health services technician (HS), which is sourced from seamen in that service&#x27;s administrative and scientific group.
* Those in the shipboard engineering and hull group, comprising conventional (USN + USCG) and nuclear (USN only) powerplants and propulsion, as well as the hull maintenance area, are called &quot;firemen.&quot; They wear red stripes on both their USN and USCG blue uniforms and, in the case of the Navy, white uniforms.
* Those in the aviation group of the Navy and Coast Guard are called &quot;airmen&quot;, and they wear green stripes on blue uniforms (USN + USCG) and white uniforms (USN only).
* Enlisted personnel in the construction group, which primarily populates the U.S. Navy&#x27;s civil engineering construction battalions (i.e., Seabees), are called &quot;constructionmen&quot; and they wear light blue stripes on both their blue and white uniforms. Constructionmen are unique to the U.S. Navy; there is no U.S. Coast Guard equivalent.

No such stripes for E-1, E-2 or E-3 are authorized to be worn on working uniforms, e.g., navy work uniform, USCG operational dress uniform, coveralls, utility wear, flight suits, hospital and clinic garb, diving suits, etc. However, sailors with the pay grade of E-2 or E-3 are permitted to wear silver-anodized collar devices on their service uniforms.

Some sailors and Coast Guardsmen receive a rating following completion of a military technical training course for that particular rating known as an &quot;A&quot; school. Other sailors and Coast Guardsmen who have completed the requirements to be assigned a rating and have been accepted by the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Naval Personnel (USN) or the Coast Guard Personnel Service Center Command (USCG) as holding that rating (a process called &quot;striking&quot;) are called &quot;designated strikers&quot;, and are referred to by their full rate and rating in formal communications (i.e., machinist&#x27;s mate fireman (MMFN), as opposed to simply fireman (FN)), though the rating is often left off in informal communications. Those who have not officially been assigned to a rating are officially referred to as &quot;undesignated&quot; or &quot;non-rates.&quot; Once selected for a particular rating of their choice they become eligible for advancement in that community.

== Venezuela==
The rank is used by the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela.

<doc id="553938" wikidata="Q967772" url="?curid=553938" title="Ka band">
<text>The Ka band (pronounced as either &quot;kay-ay band&quot; or &quot;ka band&quot;) is a portion of the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The designation &quot;Ka-band&quot; is from Kurz-above, which stems from the German word &quot;kurz,&quot; meaning &quot;short&quot;. 

There is no standard definition of Ka-band. IEEE Standard letter designations for Radar Bands define the nominal frequency range for Ka band in the range 27–40 gigahertz (GHz) in Tables 1 and 2 of IEEE Standard 521
i.e. wavelengths from slightly over one centimeter down to 7.5 millimeters.
The ITU however approves Ka-band satellite networks in the 17.3-31 GHz frequency range,
with most Ka-band satellite networks having uplinks in the 27.5-31 GHz and downlinks in the 17.7-21.2 GHz range. 

The band is called Ka, short for &quot;K-above&quot; because it is the upper part of the original (now obsolete) NATO K band, which was split into three bands because of the presence of the atmospheric water vapor resonance peak at 22.24 GHz (1.35 cm), which made the center unusable for long range transmission. The 30/20 GHz band is used in communications satellite uplinks in either the 27.5 GHz or 31 GHz bands, and in high-resolution, close-range targeting radars aboard military airplanes. Some frequencies in this radio band are used for vehicle speed detection by law enforcement. The Kepler Mission used this frequency range to downlink the scientific data collected by the space telescope. This frequency is also used for remote sensing of clouds by radar, by both ground-based or satellite systems such as INCUS.

In satellite communications, the Ka band allows higher bandwidth communication. It was first used in the experimental ACTS Gigabit Satellite Network, and is currently used for high-throughput satellite Internet access in geostationary orbit (GEO) by the Inmarsat I-5 system, Kacific K-1 satellite, the ViaSat 1, 2, and 3 satellites among others; in low Earth orbit (LEO) by the SpaceX Starlink system and the Iridium Next satellite series; it is also used in medium Earth orbit (MEO) by the SES O3b system; and the James Webb Space Telescope.

Planned future satellite projects using the Ka-band include Amazon&#x27;s Project Kuiper satellite internet constellation in LEO, SES&#x27;s multi-orbit satellite internet system of the SES-17 satellite in GEO (launched in October 2021; in position and fully operational in June 2022) and the O3b mPOWER constellation in MEO (first two satellites launched December 2022, nine more 2023-2024, and starting service in Q3 2023).

The Ka band is more susceptible to rain attenuation than is the , which in turn is more susceptible than the C band. The frequency is commonly used by cosmic microwave background experiments. 5th generation mobile networks will also partially overlap with the Ka band (28, 38, and 60 GHz).

<text>The L band is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) designation for the range of frequencies in the [[radio spectrum]] from 1 to 2 gigahertz (GHz). This is at the top end of the ultra high frequency (UHF) band, at the lower end of the microwave range.

== Applications ==

=== Mobile service ===

In Europe, the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) has harmonized part of the L band (1452–1492 MHz), allowing individual countries to adopt this spectrum for terrestrial mobile/fixed communications networks supplemental downlink (MFCN SDL). By means of carrier aggregation, an LTE-Advanced or UMTS/HSDPA base station could use this spectrum to provide additional bandwidth for communications from the base station to the mobile device; i.e., in the downlink direction.

In the Americas, mobile services are operated between the 1.7 GHz to 2.1 GHz range in the PCS and AWS bands.

=== Satellite navigation ===
The Global Positioning System carriers are in the L band, centered at 1176.45 MHz (L5), 1227.60 MHz (L2), 1381.05 MHz (L3), and 1575.42 MHz (L1) frequencies. L band waves are used for GPS units because they are able to penetrate clouds, fog, rain, storms, and vegetation. Only dense environments such as heavy forest canopies or concrete buildings can cause GPS units to receive data inaccurately.

The Galileo Navigation System, the GLONASS System, and the BeiDou systems use the L band similar to GPS, although the frequency ranges are named differently. Modern receivers, such as those found in smartphones, are able to take advantage of multiple systems (usually only around the oldest L1 band) at the same time.

=== Telecommunications use ===
Mobile phones operate at 600–900 and 1700–2100 MHz. Iridium Communications satellite phones use frequencies between 1616 and 1626.5 MHz to communicate with the satellites. Iridium Communications 2-way messaging service Snapdragon Satellite will utilize frequencies in the L Band as well. Inmarsat and Ligado Networks (formerly LightSquared) terminals use frequencies between 1525 and 1646.5 MHz. Thuraya satellite phones use frequencies between 1525 and 1661 MHz.

In January 2025 China Telecom Satellite Application Technology Research Institute, in association withHuawei, and others industry announced the Tiantong was capable of providing regular smartphones bidirectional access to satellite communications within their allocated L-band frequency (as opposed to specific satellite phones) 

=== NOAA ===
NOAA cyclically broadcasts weather data from its two geosynchronous satellites on 1694.1 MHz.

=== Aircraft surveillance ===
The aircraft L-band ranges from 960–1215MHz. Aircraft can use Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) equipment at 1090 MHz to communicate position information to the ground as well as between them for traffic information and avoidance. The 1090 MHz frequency (paired with 1030 MHz) is also used by Mode S transponders, which ADS-B augments when operated at this frequency. The TCAS system also utilizes the 1030/1090MHz paired frequencies. ADS-B information can also be broadcast on the L band frequency of 978 MHz. DME and TACAN systems are also in this frequency band.

=== Amateur radio ===
The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range 1,240–1,300 MHz, and amateur satellite up-links are allowed in the range 1,260–1,270 MHz. This is known as the 23-centimeter band by radio amateurs and as the L-band by AMSAT.

=== Digital audio broadcasting ===
In the United States and overseas territories, the L band is held by the military for telemetry, thereby forcing digital radio to in-band on-channel (IBOC) solutions. Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) in Europe primarily uses Band III, but was historically also allowed to be carried in the 1452–1492MHz range in some countries.

WorldSpace satellite radio used to broadcast in the 1467–1492 MHz L sub-band.

=== Digital video broadcasting ===
DVB-H, DVB-SH, and DVB-T2 can operate in the L band.

=== Digital multimedia broadcasting ===

T-DMB can operate in the L band.

=== Astronomy ===
The band contains the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (the hydrogen line, 1420 MHz), which is of great astronomical interest as a means of imaging the normally invisible neutral atomic hydrogen in interstellar space. The band also contains hydroxyl radical transition lines at 1665 and 1667 MHz. Consequently, parts of the L band are protected radio astronomy allocations worldwide. Specifically, the 1400–1427 MHz and 1660.6–1670.0 MHz regions are protected.

<text>Chemlab is an American industrial rock band formed in Washington D.C. in 1989 by Dylan Thomas More, Joe Frank, and Jared Louche (then known as Hendrickson). Influenced by the pioneers of the industrial genre, such as Throbbing Gristle, Chemlab mixed experimental sounds with rock and metal within an electronic framework. They released their first EP &quot;10 Ton Pressure&quot; (1990), parted ways with Frank and moved to New York City, their base for the duration of their career. Chemlab released their debut album &quot;Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar&quot; in 1993 and toured with acts such as White Zombie, KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, 16volt, and GWAR.

==History==

=== Initial releases (1990–2004) ===
Chemlab&#x27;s first release was the EP &quot;10 Ton Pressure,&quot; in 1990. Chemlab toured as opening acts for Nine Inch Nails from 1990 to 1991 for the Sin tour, which was a part of the greater Pretty Hate Machine Tour . After releasing the albums &quot;Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar&quot; (1993) and &quot;East Side Militia&quot; (1996) on Fifth Colvmn Records, Chemlab broke up in 1997 and then later reformed in 2004 to release an album titled &quot;Oxidizer&quot; with Jared as the only original member.

=== Intermittent touring (2004–2012) ===
After a seven-year hiatus from the stage, Jared recreated Chemlab and, with a backing band composed of the members of electro-industrial group mindFIELD performed a one-off show in Boston, Massachusetts in August 2005. The band played another one-off show, this time in New York City on January 7, 2006. A third show in San Francisco on March 17, 2006, saw the band joined by fellow coldwave bands Babyland and Deathline International. 

The band played at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival and the Blacksun Festival. In late 2007, the band toured the US for the first time in eight years, with the supporting line-up of multi-instrumentalist/programmer Gabriel Shaw (mindFIELD), Wade Alin (Christ Analogue) and Jason Bazinet (SMP).

During the spring of 2010, Chemlab toured North America with 16volt and Left Spine Down.

Jared Louche announced on stage during a performance on September 7, 2012 in Chicago, that it would be the band&#x27;s final show.

=== Later years (2012–present) ===
In the spring of 2018, it was announced that Chemlab would return for Cold Waves VII in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles to perform &quot;Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar&quot; in its entirety to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release. The band also performed at Cold Waves VIII, along with a number of other standalone shows. The band later released the compilation &quot;Tape Decay&quot; in 2019. This release includes unreleased tracks from the &quot;East Side Militia&quot;, &quot;Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar&quot; and &quot;10 Ton Pressure&quot; cassette demos as well as new songs. The band performed at the Oriental Theater in Denver with Pop Will Eat Itself and Scifidelic from September 21 to 22, 2019.

Dylan Thomas More died on January 4, 2025.

<doc id="553945" wikidata="Q1350138" url="?curid=553945" title="Jay Farrar">
<text>Jay Stuart Farrar (born December 26, 1966) is an American songwriter and musician currently based in St. Louis. A member of two critically acclaimed music groups, Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt, he began his solo music career in 2001. Beyond his established talents as a songwriter, he is a guitarist, pianist, harmonicist, and a vocalist.

==Uncle Tupelo==
Farrar formed Uncle Tupelo with Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn in 1987 after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primatives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s major label debut album &quot;Anodyne&quot;, Farrar announced his decision to leave the band owing to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo is often mentioned as one of the originators of the alt-country genre of music or subgenre of country music that combines country, folk and/or bluegrass with punk rock, alt-rock, indie rock or other genres.

==Son Volt==

After the dissolution of Uncle Tupelo in 1994, Farrar formed the rock group Son Volt, whose original lineup released three albums in the late 1990s, before undergoing a hiatus in 1999. In 1999, Farrar was invited to participate in the tribute album for Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was terminally ill with cancer. The album, &quot;More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album &quot; (Birdman, 1999), was an album of cover versions of the songs on Spence&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Oar&quot; (Columbia, 1999). In 2005, the band re-formed with a different lineup and has since released seven additional albums.

==Other==

In 1995, Farrar collaborated with Kelly Willis on the song &quot;Rex&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which appeared on the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization.

As a solo artist, Farrar has released two full-length albums, two EPs, one film score, and various live recordings. His full-length albums are &quot;Sebastopol&quot; (2001) and &quot;Terroir Blues&quot; (2003), the first released on the independent record label Artemis Records and the second released on his own label, Transmit Sound.

An EP of songs from the &quot;Sebastopol&quot; sessions, entitled &quot;ThirdShiftGrottoSlack&quot; was released in 2002. His score for the independent film &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot; (2002, directors Alex and Andrew Smith) was released in 2003 on the independent record label Bloodshot Records. Farrar formed his own independent record label in 2003, Transmit Sound (formerly called &quot;Act/Resist Records&quot;).

In 2004, Farrar released a six-song live acoustic EP entitled &quot;Live EP&quot;. Also 2004 marked the release of the live CD/DVD &quot;Stone, Steel &amp; Bright Lights&quot;.

Farrar worked closely with keyboardist Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips during the recording of &quot;Sebastopol&quot;. Eric Heywood, Mark Spencer from the Blood Oranges, and the rock group Canyon have often accompanied Farrar in his solo recordings and performances. Spencer is now a full-time member of Son Volt.

In 2006, Farrar announced the formation of a new band, Gob Iron, with Varnaline&#x27;s Anders Parker. The songs which would make up their debut album were recorded in autumn 2004, while Farrar was in the process of recording a new Son Volt album. In April 2019, Parker and Farrar released a 7-inch single using the Gob Iron moniker.

Farrar collaborated with Ben Gibbard (of the indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie) to create all of the music for the soundtrack for the 2009 documentary film &quot;One Fast Move or I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, about Jack Kerouac&#x27;s time spent at Big Sur. The soundtrack was released on October 20, 2009.

In 2012, Farrar, along with Will Johnson, Yim Yames, and Anders Parker collaborated on the Woody Guthrie archive project, &quot;New Multitudes&quot;.

==Style==
His musical style ranges from sparse, unaccompanied folk music to full rock and roll band arrangements comparable to Neil Young or Dinosaur Jr. His solo recordings also often include sound experiments, reminiscent of psychedelia, with a distinct Eastern bent. One of the hallmarks of his sound is the use of alternate tunings on the guitar. His love for Woody Guthrie inspired a custom guitar made by Creston Lea of Vermont. The guitar was made from artifacts Jay gathered from the site of Guthrie&#x27;s childhood home.

<text>Dinmukhamed Akhmetuly &quot;Dimash&quot; Kunaev (also spelled Kunayev; , ; – 22 August 1993) was a Kazakh Soviet communist politician who served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR.

==Early life==

=== Origins ===
His grandfather was Zhumabai (kaz. Jumabai) (–1912). His father, Minliakhmed (Akhmed) Zhumabaievich (kaz. Meŋlıahmed Jumabaiūly) (1886–1976), was literate, worked in agricultural and trade organizations of the Alma-Ata oblast and could write well in both Russian and Kazakh. His mother, Zaure Baiyrovna Kunaeva (née Shynbolatova (Chimbulatova)) (kaz. Zaure Baiypqyzy Qonaeva) (1888—1973), was born in a poor family in the Shelek aul, Almaty oblast. They lived together for 70 years. There are claims that Kunaev might possibly come from the oiyq branch of the Ysty tribe, Senior juz. In his &quot;From Stalin to Gorbachev&quot; book, he mentioned that his &quot;ancestors come from the Baidıbek, jigit of the Senior juz&quot;. According to the official biography, he is ethnically Kazakh and his ancestors were hunters, that lived on the coasts of Ili (river) and Kürtı rivers of the Balkhash District in the aul Bakanas. Kunaev, the son of a Kazakh clerk, was born at Verny, now Almaty, and grew up in a middle-income family.

== Rise to power ==

After finishing the Almaty №14th secondary school in 1930, he studied in the Institute of Non-Ferrous and Fine Metallurgy in Moscow in 1936, which enabled him to become a machine operator. By 1939 he had become engineer-in-chief of the Pribalkhashatroi mine, and joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), a condition of the position.

Kunaev was deputy chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Kazakh SSR from April 1942 to 1946. In this post, during the years of World War II, he conducted significant work on the deployment and commissioning of enterprises and factories evacuated to Kazakhstan from the front-line areas of the USSR, as well as mobilising and training the republic&#x27;s human reserves and soldiers for the Red Army. From 1946 to 1952, he was deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. In 1952, he was elected President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR, which under his leadership conducted scientific research with the aim of developing and improving industry and agriculture, and the more efficient use of Kazakhstan&#x27;s natural resources. He served in this post until 1955, when he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR.

Kunaev&#x27;s rise in Communist Party ranks had been closely tied to that of Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s. In February 1954, Khrushchev appointed Panteleymon Ponomarenko as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, and Leonid Brezhnev as the second secretary. Soon, Kunaev and Brezhnev developed a close friendship which lasted until the death of Brezhnev.

Brezhnev soon became the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in 1955 and a member of CPSU Politburo in 1956. When Brezhnev left Kazakhstan in 1956, Ivan Iakovlev became the First Secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party (and was succeeded by Nikolai Belyaev). On 19 January 1960, Kunaev was elected 1st Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan.
===First stint in charge: 1960-1962===
One of Kunaev&#x27;s first actions as leader of the Kazakh SSR was a visit to the United States in January 1960, as part of a delegation lead by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, Dmitry Polyansky. Over the course of a month, the delegation visited 23 American cities in 10 states, including New York and Washington. During the trip, Kunaev met with the leadership of the United Nations, including the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld as well as with senior American statesmen including US Secretary of State Christian Herter, Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court Earl Warren, and several state governors. At the end of the visit, the Soviet delegation including Kunaev were received at the White House by the US President, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In March 1960, the leader of the USSR, Nikita Khrushchev visited the Kazakh SSR, and together with Kunaev, they toured the republic for 13 days. Based on the decisions and conversations between Kunaev and Khrushchev during the latter’s stay in Kazakhstan, large-scale work was launched to develop the republic:
* The Sokolovsko-Sarybaisky plant was put into operation.
* The first blast furnace was launched at the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant.
*The first unit of the Bukhtarma State District Power Plant was put into operation.
*The first coke battery at Karmet was put into operation and the first Kazakh coke was produced.
*The construction of a highway connecting three capitals of the union republics, namely the Alma-Ata-Frunze-Tashkent highway, was completed.
*Hundreds of other major facilities and projects throughout Kazakhstan changed the face of the country.

As First Secretary, Kunaev was an ardent supporter of the Virgin Lands campaign, which opened millions of hectares of lands in central Kazakhstan to agricultural development and caused a large influx of Russian immigrants into Kazakhstan. However, in 1962 he was dismissed from his position as he disagreed with Khrushchev&#x27;s plans to transfer some lands in Southern Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan. Ismail Yusupov, a supporter of the plan, replaced Kunaev. Another source of disagreements between Kunaev and Khrushchev had been the creation of a new administrative entity, the &quot;Virgin Lands Territory&quot;, which incorporated the Kazakh regions of Kokchetav, Pavlodar, Kustanai, North Kazakhstan and Tselinograd into a new region with dual subordination to Alma-Ata and Moscow.

== First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan ==
After his dismissal as First Secretary, he was Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR until 1964, when he became first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan again in 1964 when Khrushchev was ousted and replaced by Brezhnev. He kept his position for twenty-two more years. Kunaev was appointed as an alternate member of the Politburo in 1967, and became a full member in 1971.

=== Economic development ===
Kunaev&#x27;s return to the position of First Secretary of the Kazakh SSR coincided with the start of major economic reforms in the USSR, known as the Kosygin reforms. That year, over 450 thousand people throughout Kazakhstan received apartments, and the average salary increased by 28% compared to 1958.

Under Kunaev, Kazakhstan became one of the three largest economies of the USSR, along with Russia and Ukraine, the traditional industrial centers of the country since Tsarist times. As Russian political scientist Andrei Grozin notes, “Conventionally speaking, before Kunaev, Kazakhstan in economic terms was a desert.” Some of the major economic successes of Kunaev&#x27;s Kazakhstan include:
*From the material of the Information and Analytical Center of Moscow State University: &quot; According to statistics, during the years of D.A. Kunaev&#x27;s activity, the republic&#x27;s productive potential grew by more than 700%. The volume of industry grew 9 times, agriculture - 6 times, capital construction - 8 times.
*About 1,000 enterprises and workshops were commissioned throughout the republic; such a volume of construction work throughout the country has not been seen either before or after in Kazakhstan.
*Of the currently operating largest oil refineries in Kazakhstan, two were built under Kunaev: in the cities of Pavlodar (1978) and Chimkent (1985).
*Coal production grew from 28 million to 132 million tons between 1955 and 1986.
*The production of electricity increased by 6 times between 1955-1986 (from 14.5 million to 85 million kilowatt-hours).
*During the period 1954-1984, 600 million tons of grain were produced in Kazakhstan, with the average annual sale of grain increasing ninefold.

Furthermore, many significant objects were built in Kazakhstan, including the Medeu sports complex, the National Library building, the House of Political Education, new buildings of KazGU (unofficially called KazGUgrad), the Central Republican Museum, the Kaztelecenter building, the Koktobe TV tower, the House of Friendship, the Glory Monument in the Park of 28 Panfilov Guardsmen, the Kazakhstan, Otyrar, Alma-Ata, Alatau hotels, the Alatau and Kazakhstan sanatoriums, the Samal, Aksai, Almagul, Ainabulak microdistricts and many other cultural and residential facilities.

=== Culture and science ===
Source:

Throughout his time in office, Dinmukhamed Kunayev, paid special attention to important Kazakh cultural figures. He personally initiated many of them to nominate prestigious All-Union prizes and awards. Among them: Gabit Musrepov, Serke Kozhamkulov, Ilyas Yesenberlin, Bibigul Tulegenova, Olzhas Suleimenov, Nurgisa Tlendiev, Roza Rymbaeva and many others. He believed that their successes glorified the Kazakh culture and nation far beyond the borders of the republic.

In addition to this, Kunaev defended and supported cultural figures whose works fell under the censorship machine of the USSR. Thus, it was largely thanks to Kunaev that the works of Olzhas Suleimenov&#x27;s &quot;AZiYA&quot; and Ilyas Yesenberlin&#x27;s &quot;Nomads&quot; were published. In those years, books were published in Alma-Ata that were often refused to be published in Moscow and other parts of the USSR, for example, the works of Nikolai Raevsky &quot;If Portraits Speak&quot;, &quot;Portraits Have Spoken&quot;, Yuri Dombrovsky&#x27;s book &quot;Torch&quot; and others. To a large extent, this was possible because Kunaev himself was not a supporter of bans on self-expression of writers and theatergoers.

As an Academian and former President of the Kazakh Academy of Science, Kunaev often relied on the position of the scientific community in solving state-important problems. By 1985, the Kazakh Academy of Sciences had become a major scientific center of the USSR, employing over 40 thousand personnel, among them 864 doctors of science, 650 academicians, corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences and professors. During the time of Yuri Andropov as General Secretary, at the personal request of Kunayev, foreign currency funds were allocated for the purchase of modern equipment from Western countries intended for industrial enterprises and scientific institutions of the Kazakh SSR.

Soviet Kazakhstan was recognised in the world of science due to frequent major international events in Kazakhstan with the participation of leading scientists from both the USSR and abroad. Among such events, one can especially note the international conference of the World Health Organization, which was held in Alma-Ata in 1978. It became historical in the world health system, since it adopted a declaration called the &quot;Great Charter of World Health&quot; by the UN.

=== Strengthening sovereignty ===
Source:

One of the main measures of Kunaev as First Secretary was the issue of strengthening the territorial integrity of the republic. Thus, less than a month after he took office, on December 1, 1964, the West Kazakhstan Territory and South Kazakhstan Territory were abolished. A year later, in 1965, the Virgin Lands Territory which Khrushchev had created several years earlier was abolished. The leadership of the republic understood that the Virgin Lands created under Khrushchev was another territory that they intended to separate from Kazakhstan.

Under Kunaev&#x27;s initiative, on November 23, 1970, the Turgai region was formed as part of the Kazakh SSR from parts of the Kustanai and Tselinograd regions, and on March 20, 1973, the Jezkazgan region was formed from parts of the Karaganda region. These decisions allowed the creation of administrative units in the north of the country that were predominantly populated by ethnic Kazakhs. These measures reduced the ambiguous political talk behind the scenes about the northern regions being predominantly non-Kazakh and hence reduced the chance that they would be separated from Kazakhstan.

Kunaev did something that no other Soviet leader of Kazakhstan had done before him. He returned a number of areas in the south of the republic that had previously been transferred to the Uzbek SSR during the tenure of his predecessors under Khrushchev. Since the formation of the Kazakh SSR in 1936, for the first time the territory of the republic did not decrease, but increased.

=== Foreign policy ===
Source:

Kunaev was often trusted to lead government and parliamentary delegations of the USSR on official trips abroad, and to conduct negotiations with leaders of other states on behalf of the entire country. Kunaev led delegations to Algeria (1966), Iran (1968), the United Arab Republic (1970), North Korea (1978), Japan (1984), and was a member of delegations to Uruguay, Italy, India, Great Britain and other countries.

Speaking about his foreign trips to various countries as a leader and member of high Soviet government and parliamentary delegations, D.A. Kunayev emphasizes in his book “From Stalin to Gorbachev”: “ Wherever I was, in whatever countries I was, I always tried to tell in as much detail as possible about my republic, what Kazakhstan is “rich and famous for”, about the traditions, customs of the Kazakh people, about its culture and science.

=== Fall from power ===
During his leadership of the Kazakh SSR, Kunaev strongly promoted local talent. He notably recommended Nursultan Nazarbayev, the future first president of Kazakhstan, for the role of head of government. During an informal meeting with members of the Central Committee, he remarked:
During Kunaev&#x27;s long rule, Kazakhs occupied prominent positions in the bureaucracy, economy and educational institutions. However, by 1986, a political struggle began between supporters of Kunaev, and supporters of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Chairman of the Kazakh Council of Ministers (and Kunaev&#x27;s former protegee). This culminated at the 16th Congress of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in February 1986, when Kunaev came under criticism from several high ranking members of the Kazakh Communist Party, most notable by Nazarbayev.

Nazarbayev criticized the construction in Almaty of a number of objects of great importance for the city, calling the historical museum and other social and household objects unnecessary for the city, an unnecessary waste of large funds. Nazarbayev also attacked the leadership of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences, led by Askar Kunayev, Dinmukhamed&#x27;s brother. This was despite the fact that under Askar Kunaev, the Academy became one of the leading scientific centers in the USSR, which was reflected by the Central Committee report which gave a positive assessment of the Academy&#x27;s activities. Nevertheless, Askar became subject to biased and unobjective criticism from the Soviet newspaper, Pravda, and was dismissed as President of the Academy shortly after the party congress, to be replaced by Murat Aitkhozhin. It must also be noted that D.A. Kunaev himself was subject to criticism from Erkin Auelbekov, First Secretary of the Kyzylorda Regional Committee and Kamalidenov, the Ideology Secretary, who criticized the heads of universities for the high percentage of students of Kazakh ethnicity. This speech had an unequivocal negative effect on the public in Kazakhstan.

Dinmukhamed Kunayev, Nazarbayev&#x27;s boss and Askar&#x27;s brother, felt deeply angered and betrayed at the criticism at the Congress. Kunayev went to Moscow and demanded Nazarbayev&#x27;s dismissal while Nazarbayev&#x27;s supporters campaigned for Kunayev&#x27;s dismissal and Nazarbayev&#x27;s promotion. However, this did not go well for Kunaev, who saw Nazarbaev keep his position as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Soon D. A. Kunaev himself was dismissed, as he was removed from office under pressure from Mikhail Gorbachev, who accused him of corruption. On 16 December 1986 the Politburo replaced him with Gennady Kolbin, the First Secretary of the Ulyanovsk Regional Committee.

==== Jeltoqsan ====
The decision to replace Kunaev, an ethnic Kazakh with Kolbin, an ethnic Russian who had never lived in the Kazakh SSR before set off three days of street rioting in Almaty, between 16 and 18 December 1986 – which were the first signs of ethnic strife during Gorbachev&#x27;s tenure. In modern Kazakhstan, this revolt is called Jeltoqsan (meaning December in Kazakh).

The protests were violently suppressed by the KGB, who detained 8.5 thousand people. More than 1,700 people were injured, and about 5.5 thousand people were interrogated. In addition, hundreds were convicted, received penalties, fired from work, expelled from school, and subjected to administrative fines. Almost immediately after the December events D.A. Kunaev began to be accused of &quot;nationalism&quot; and was named among the organisers of the so-called riots by Kolbin, who stated that the reason for the &quot;forceful solution to the issue&quot; was allegedly Kunaev&#x27;s refusal to speak to the youth. However, this is untrue, as Kunaev volunteered to speak to the protestors, but was not allowed to by Second Secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party, Oleg Miroshkin. This version of events is backed up by the recollections of Anatoly Goryainy (chief of personal security, colonel of the KGB).

In January 1987, D. A. Kunaev was removed from the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and in June 1987 from the Central Committee of the CPSU. The well-known lawyer, academician Salyk Zimanov later stated that: &quot;The reprisals against the &quot;Kunaevites&quot; began, including anyone who treated Kunaev D.A. with respect or spoke positively about him... Among them were Kunaev&#x27;s assistant D.A. Bekezhanov, the manager of the affairs of the Central Committee of the party A.G. Statenin, and the head of the special forces escort of the first secretary of the Communist Party of the Republic M.I. Akuev. All of them were arrested and convicted. They were even credited with allegedly being among the initiators of the December events.&quot;

==Later life==
===Isolation and smear campaign===
Kunaev was placed practically under house arrest. On Kolbin&#x27;s personal instructions, Kunayev&#x27;s contact with the outside world was minimized. Surveillance was established: where he goes, who comes to see him. Some of Kunaev&#x27;s neighbors periodically reported to Kolbin about Kunayev&#x27;s life, which is indirectly and directly confirmed by notes stored in the archives. There was a period when neighbors and old acquaintances avoided communicating with Kunayev. Among those who did not completely cut off ties with Dimash Akhmedovich in the period 1986-1989 were close relatives, as well as poet Olzhas Suleimenov, journalist Gennady Tolmachev, personal doctor Akhat Mulyukov, A. Goryainov, A. Shabdarbayev and others.

Despite Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of glasnost, perestroika and democratization, neither foreign nor domestic journalists were allowed to approach Kunaev. Even if Kazakh journalists interviewed D.A. Kunaev, their materials were published only in a negative light. Thus, journalist Nina Savitskaya recalled that her material about D.A. Kunaev with his interview was not allowed, saying that if they did publish it, only on the condition that Kunaev would have to be &quot;diluted with dirt&quot;. She refused to publish her material under such conditions, doing so a year later, when the disgrace against Kunaev was lifted. Gennady Kolbin, with permission from the center in Moscow, also made sure that Kunayev was deprived of his dacha and the pension due to him.

On the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new state status of Kazakhstan, Kunayev wrote:

&quot;Who argues: totalitarianism in all its forms and variants has truly outlived itself. Every phenomenon and process, including social ones, has its beginning and its end. Apparently, what had to happen happened. But, of course, not in such &quot;primitive&quot; forms, which catastrophically hit the working man first of all. But - I repeat with confidence - not all is lost. On the contrary! And especially for our native Republic of Kazakhstan. For the first time in many years, it has finally gained real independence and has become an equal state among the entire world community. Now it is vitally important for Kazakhstan, without compromising its sovereignty, to eradicate the vices of the totalitarian system, to develop and strengthen business ties with all countries in every possible way...&quot;. 

===Rehabilitation===
On January 12, 1992, Dinmukhamed Kunayev turned 80 years old, receiving hundreds of letters and telegrams from all over Kazakhstan, including from academic scientists, cultural figures, famous athletes, military generals, major manufacturers, businessmen and significant representatives of other spheres. Kunaev was visited by many famous public figures, including the first Kazakh cosmonaut Toktar Aubakirov, the founder of the Kazakh and Turkish schools of taekwondo Mustafa Ozturk, theologian and translator of the Koran into Kazakh Khalifa Altay, People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR Bibigul Tulegenova, Bakytzhan Momyshuly (son of the legendary Bauyrzhan Momyshuly) and many, many others. Thus, the rehabilitation of Kunaev was complete, and he celebrated his 80th birthday as a person whose name was once again respected among Kazakhs all over the world.
He died in the evening of 22 August 1993 in the village of Akshi, Alakol district of Almaty region as a result of a heart attack. He was buried on 25 August 1993 at the Kensai cemetery in the city of Alma-Ata.

== Achievements ==
Under D. A. Kunaev, a significant economic upswing in Kazakh SSR was achieved, the industrial potential of the republic increased significantly (mainly due to the mining, raw materials industries and the energy sector serving them) and agriculture (the annual famous “billion pounds” of grain was produced many times). In his book &quot;From Stalin to Gorbachev&quot; (1994), Kunaev himself referred to the data of the USSR State Statistics Committee, and he describes in detail his contribution to the development of living standards and the rise of the economy of the Kazakh SSR. By the end of Kunaev&#x27;s time in power, compared with 1955, the economic potential of the Kazakh SSR increased by seven times, the standard of living, industry, production rose to a historic maximum, and the Kazakh SSR became the third largest economy in the Soviet Union (after the Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR). For great services to the development of the economy and the standard of living in the country, he was very popular among the Kazakh people and many still call the Kunaev era as the &quot;Golden Age of Kazakhstan&quot; to this day.

<doc id="553947" wikidata="Q2018880" url="?curid=553947" title="S band">
<text>The S band is a designation by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for a part of the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum covering frequencies from 2 to 4 gigahertz (GHz). Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the UHF and SHF bands at 3.0 GHz. The S band is used by airport surveillance radar for air traffic control, weather radar, surface ship radar, and some communications satellites, particularly satellites used by NASA to communicate with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. The 10 cm radar short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2 GHz. India&#x27;s regional satellite navigation network (IRNSS) broadcasts on 2.483778 to 2.500278 GHz.

The S band also contains the 2.4–2.483 GHz ISM band, widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones (Bluetooth), garage door openers, keyless vehicle locks, baby monitors as well as for medical diathermy machines and microwave ovens (typically at 2.495 GHz). One of its largest uses is 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi wireless networks, allowing smartphones, laptops, printers and TVs to connect to the internet without cables. 
==Wi-Fi==
The largest use of this band is by Wi-Fi networks; the IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g standards use the 2.4 GHz section of the S band. These are the most widely used computer networks in the world, used globally in home and small office networks to link desktop and laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, smart TVs, printers, and smart speakers together and to a wireless router to connect them to the Internet, and in wireless access points in public places like coffee shops, hotels, libraries and airports to provide the public Internet access for mobile devices.

==Mobile services==

Mobile services are operated in the 2.3 GHz to 2.6 GHz range, specifically between the 2300–2400 MHz band and the 2500–2690 MHz band. Spectrum in the 3.55–3.7 GHz band has been auctioned off in the United States to be used for CBRS services and spectrum between 3.45–3.55 GHz and 3.7–3.98 GHz has been auctioned off by the FCC for 5G although this spectrum is referred to as C Band by the agency.

==Satellite communications==

In the United States, the FCC approved satellite-based Digital Audio Radio Service (DARS) broadcasting in the S band from 2.31 to 2.36 GHz in 1995, used by Sirius XM Radio. More recently, it has approved portions of the S band between 2.0 and 2.2 GHz for the creation of Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) networks in connection with Ancillary Terrestrial Components (ATC). There have been a number of companies attempting to deploy such networks, including ICO Satellite Management (now Pendrell Corporation) and TerreStar (defunct).

The 2.6 GHz range is used for China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting, a satellite radio and mobile TV standard which, as with proprietary systems in the United States, is incompatible with the open standards used in the rest of the world.

In May 2009, Inmarsat and Solaris Mobile (a joint venture between Eutelsat and SES (EchoStar Mobile)) were each awarded a 2×15 MHz portion of the S band by the European Commission. The two companies are allowed two years to start providing pan-European MSS services for 18 years. Allocated frequencies are 1.98 to 2.01 GHz for Earth to space communications, and from 2.17 to 2.2 GHz for space to Earth communications. The Eutelsat W2A satellite was launched in April 2009 and is located at 10° East.

In Indonesia, S band is used by MNC Vision for Direct-to-Home satellite television (unlike similar services in most countries, which use Ku band). The frequency typically allocated for this service is 2.5 to 2.7 GHz (LOF 1.570 GHz).

IndoStar-1 was the world&#x27;s first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast, which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80 cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. A similar Ku- or C-band reception performance requires greater transmission power or much larger dish to penetrate the moist atmosphere.

=== Deep space communications ===
Many NASA spacecraft (near Earth and interplanetary) can communicate in the S-band, often using the Deep Space Network. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, utilizes 2 GHz S-band to enable 40 kbps real time telemetry from near the Sun–Earth L2 point.

==Other uses==
Microwave ovens operate at 2495 or 2450 MHz in the ISM band IEEE 802.16a. Some digital cordless telephones operate in this band too. 802.16e standards use a part of the frequency range of S band; under WiMAX standards. Most vendors are manufacturing equipment in the range of 3.5 GHz. The exact frequency range allocated for this type of use varies between countries.

In North America, is an ISM band used for unlicensed spectrum devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones, and video senders, among other consumer electronics uses, including Bluetooth which operates between 2.402 GHz and 2.480 GHz.

Amateur radio and amateur satellite operators have two S-band allocations, 13 cm (2.4 GHz) and 9 cm (3.4 GHz). Amateur television repeaters also operate in these bands.

Airport surveillance radars typically operate in the 2700–2900 MHz range.

Particle accelerators may be powered by S-band RF sources. The frequencies are then standardized at 2.998 GHz corresponding to a wavelength of 100 mm (Europe) or 2.856 GHz (US).

The National NEXRAD Radar network operates with S-band frequencies. Before implementation of this system, C-band frequencies were commonly used for weather surveillance.

In the United States, the 3.55 to 3.7 GHz band is becoming shared spectrum under rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in April 2015 as a result of the National Broadband Plan (United States). The biggest user of CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) spectrum is the United States Navy. Cable companies are planning to use the band for wireless broadband in rural areas, with Charter Communications beginning tests of the service in January 2018.

The band is also used as a transmit intermediate frequency in satellite communications as a replacement for L band where a single/shared coaxial connection is used between the modem/IDU and antenna/ODU for both the transmit and receive signals. This is to prevent interference between the transmit and receive signals which would otherwise not occur on a dual coaxial setup where the transmit and receive signals are separate and both can use the whole L-band frequency range. In a single coaxial connection using S-Band to &quot;frequency shift&quot; the transmit signal away from L band, a multiplier such as 10, is usually applied to form the SHF frequency. For example, the modem would transmit at 2.815 GHz IF (S Band) to the ODU and then the ODU up-converts this signal to 28.15 GHz SHF (Ka Band) towards the satellite.

==Optical communications==
S band is also used in optical communications to refer to the wavelength range 1460 nm to 1530 nm.

<text>The X band is the designation for a band of frequencies in the microwave radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In some cases, such as in communication engineering, the frequency range of the X band is set at approximately 7.0–11.2 GHz. In radar engineering, the frequency range is specified by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as 8.0–12.0 GHz. The X band is used for radar, satellite communication, and wireless computer networks.

== Radar ==

X band is used in radar applications, including continuous-wave, pulsed, single-polarization, dual-polarization, synthetic aperture radar, and phased arrays. X-band radar frequency sub-bands are used in civil, military, and government institutions for weather monitoring, air traffic control, maritime vessel traffic control, defense tracking, and vehicle speed detection for law enforcement.

X band is often used in modern radars. The shorter wavelengths of the X band provide higher-resolution imagery from high-resolution imaging radars for target identification and discrimination. X-band weather radars offer significant potential for short-range observations, but the loss of signal strength (attenuation) under rainy conditions limits their use at longer range.

=== Terrestrial communications and networking ===
The X band 10.15 to 10.7 GHz segment is used for terrestrial broadband in many countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Denmark, Ukraine, Spain and Ireland. Alvarion, CBNL, CableFree and Ogier make systems for this, though each has a proprietary airlink. DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) the standard used for providing cable internet to customers, uses some X band frequencies. The home / business customer-premises equipment (CPE) has a single coaxial cable with a power adapter connecting to an ordinary cable modem. The local oscillator is usually 9750 MHz, the same as for Ku band satellite TV LNB. Two way applications such as broadband typically use a 350 MHz TX offset.

=== Space communications ===
=== Space communications for science and research ===
Small portions of the X band are assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) exclusively for deep space telecommunications. The primary user of this allocation is the American NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). DSN facilities are in Goldstone, California (in the Mojave Desert), near Canberra, Australia, and near Madrid, Spain, and provide continual communications from the Earth to almost any point in the Solar System independent of Earth rotation. (DSN stations are also capable of using the older and lower S band deep-space radio communications allocations, and some higher frequencies on a more-or-less experimental basis, such as in the K band.)

Notable deep space probe programs that have employed X band communications include the Viking Mars landers; the Voyager missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond; the Galileo Jupiter orbiter; the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, the Curiosity rover and the Cassini-Huygens Saturn orbiter.

An important use of the X band communications came with the two Viking program landers. When the planet Mars was passing near or behind the Sun, as seen from the Earth, a Viking lander would transmit two simultaneous continuous-wave carriers, one in the S band and one in the X band in the direction of the Earth, where they were picked up by DSN ground stations. By making simultaneous measurements at the two different frequencies, the resulting data enabled theoretical physicists to verify the mathematical predictions of Albert Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity. These results are some of the best confirmations of the General Theory of Relativity.

The new European double Mars Mission ExoMars will also use X band communication, on the instrument LaRa, to study the internal structure of Mars, and to make precise measurements of the rotation and orientation of Mars by monitoring two-way Doppler frequency shifts between the surface platform and Earth. It will also detect variations in angular momentum due to the redistribution of masses, such as the migration of ice from the polar caps to the atmosphere.

===X band NATO frequency requirements===
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the international body which allocates radio frequencies for civilian use, is not authorised to allocate frequency bands for military radio communication. This is also the case pertaining to X band military communications satellites. However, in order to meet military radio spectrum requirements, e.g. for fixed-satellite service and mobile-satellite service, the NATO nations negotiated the NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).

== Amateur radio ==
The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range 10.000 to 10.500 GHz, and amateur satellite operations are allowed in the range 10.450 to 10.500 GHz. This is known as the 3-centimeter band by amateurs and the X-band by AMSAT.

== Other uses ==
Motion detectors often use 10.525 GHz. 10.4 GHz is proposed for traffic light crossing detectors. Comreg in Ireland has allocated 10.450 GHz for traffic sensors as SRD.

Many electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometers operate near 9.8 GHz.

Particle accelerators may be powered by X-band RF sources. The frequencies are then standardized at 11.9942 GHz (Europe) or 11.424 GHz (US), which is the second harmonic of C-band and fourth harmonic of S-band. The European X-band frequency is used for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).

<doc id="553952" wikidata="Q2882172" url="?curid=553952" title="V band">
<text>The V band (&quot;vee-band&quot;) is a standard designation by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for a band of frequencies in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 40 to 75 gigahertz (GHz). The V band is not heavily used, except for millimeter wave radar research and other kinds of scientific research. It should not be confused with the 600–1,000 MHz range of Band V (Band Five) of the UHF frequency range.

The V band is also used for high capacity terrestrial millimeter wave communications systems. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has allocated the frequency band from 57 to 71 GHz for unlicensed wireless systems. These systems are primarily used for high capacity, short distance (less than 1 mile or 1.6 km) communications. In addition, frequencies at 70, 80, and 90 GHz have been allocated as &quot;lightly licensed&quot; bands for multi-gigabit wireless communications. All communications links in the V band require unobstructed line of sight between the transmit and receive point, and rain fade must be taken into account when performing link budget analysis.

== Uses ==
On December 15, 1995 the V band at 60 GHz was used by the world&#x27;s first crosslink communication between satellites in a constellation. This communication was between the U.S. Milstar 1 and Milstar 2 military satellites. 60 GHz is attractive for secure satellite crosslinks because it allows for high data rates, narrow beams and, lying in a strong absorption band of oxygen, provides protection against intercept by ground-based adversaries.

=== Very short range Wi-Fi ===
The WiGig standard IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay utilize the 60 GHz (EHF microwave) spectrum with data transfer rates of up to 7 Gbit/s for very short ranges of up to 

=== Wireless broadband ===

Internet service providers are looking for ways to expand gigabit high-speed services to their customers. These can be achieved through fiber to the premises broadband network architecture, or a more affordable alternative using fixed wireless in the last mile in combination with the fiber networks in the middle mile in order to reduce the costs of trenching fiber optic cables to the users. In the United States and several other countries, V band is unlicensed. This makes V band an appealing choice to be used as fixed wireless access for gigabit services to connect to homes and businesses. V-band radios are available in both Point to Point (P2P) and Point to Multipoint (P2MP) configurations.

=== Satellite constellations ===
, several US, UK and Canadian companies—Boeing, SpaceX, OneWeb, Telesat, O3b Networks and Theia Holdings—have each filed with the US regulatory authorities (FCC) &quot;plans to field constellations of V-band satellites in non-geosynchronous orbits to provide communications services&quot;, an electromagnetic spectrum that had not previously been &quot;heavily employed for commercial communications services&quot;.

In 2020, SpaceX was granted permission by the FCC to launch 12,000 satellites that are able to use these frequencies.

In September 2022, Boeing launched a V-band technology demonstrator satellite known as Varuna as a rideshare payload. In November 2021, Boeing had obtained a FCC license to operate a 147-satellite V-band constellation, however in October 2023 Boeing had the license cancelled following a strategic business decisions not to proceed with the constellation.

<text>Christopher Eugene O&#x27;Donnell (born June 26, 1970) is an American actor who performs in film and television. 

He has played numerous roles since Charlie Sims in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;. Others include Chris Reece in &quot;School Ties&quot;, D&#x27;Artagnan in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, Jack Foley in the drama film &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;, Dick Grayson/Robin in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Jason Brown in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, Peter Garrett in &quot;Vertical Limit&quot;, and Wardell Pomeroy in &quot;Kinsey&quot;. 

O&#x27;Donnell also starred as Special Agent G. Callen on the CBS crime drama television series &quot;&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;NCIS&quot; from September 2009 to May 2023.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Donnell was born in the Chicago suburb of Winnetka, Illinois, the son of Julie Ann Rohs von Brecht and William Charles O&#x27;Donnell Sr., a general manager of WBBM-AM. He is the youngest of seven children, with four sisters and two brothers, and is of German and Irish descent. O&#x27;Donnell was raised in a Catholic family and attended Catholic schools. He graduated from Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois in 1988. 

O&#x27;Donnell attended Boston College and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in marketing in 1992. He had begun modeling at the age of 13 so was comfortable in front of cameras, and also had already made commercials.

==Career==
O&#x27;Donnell had already appeared in numerous commercials as a teenager, advertising Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal and Fruit Roll-Ups snacks. In a McDonald&#x27;s fast food commercial, he served NBA great Michael Jordan. 

An early television series role was an appearance on the TV series &quot;Jack and Mike&quot; in 1986. In the early 1990s, he appeared in several films including &quot;Men Don&#x27;t Leave&quot; (1990), starring Jessica Lange; &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991), appearing again with Kathy Bates from &quot;Men Don&#x27;t Leave&quot;; &quot;School Ties&quot; (1992); and &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992) with Al Pacino. For the latter he received two nominations: one for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor-Motion Picture (which was won by Gene Hackman for &quot;Unforgiven&quot;), and one for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actor (which he won). He was also named one of the 12 Promising New Actors of 1992 in John Willis&#x27;s &quot;Screen World&quot;, Vol. 44.

After appearing in the film &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (1994), reuniting him with Jessica Lange, he starred in &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; (1995) with Minnie Driver, &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1995) with Drew Barrymore, and &quot;In Love and War&quot; (1996) with Sandra Bullock. 

O&#x27;Donnell played the character of Dick Grayson/Robin in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, in which Barrymore also had a role. Reportedly the field of candidates for the role of Robin included Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Ewan McGregor, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Toby Stephens, and Scott Speedman. 

Casting directors narrowed their choices to O&#x27;Donnell and DiCaprio, and finally selected O&#x27;Donnell. He reportedly was considered by 20th Century Fox studios to play the lead role of Jack Dawson in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), but that role was won by DiCaprio.

O&#x27;Donnell had a starring role in 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Chamber&quot;, based on the John Grisham novel of the same name. He reprised his role as Robin in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. Although it was a box-office success, the movie was critically panned. O&#x27;Donnell later said that he did not believe it turned out well.

O&#x27;Donnell did not appear in another movie for two years. He was the choice of one of the producers for the role of James Darrell Edwards III/Agent J in &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), but he turned it down as being too similar to his role in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. Will Smith played this role. The subsequent films &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Bachelor&quot; (1999) were moderately successful, while &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; (2000) was a box office hit.

Following a four-year hiatus, O&#x27;Donnell returned in 2004 with the widely praised &quot;Kinsey&quot;. He also appeared in the 2004 episode of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, entitled &quot;An Old Flame with a New Wick.&quot; 

O&#x27;Donnell took a lead role in the Fox Network television series &quot;Head Cases&quot; in 2005. The show was the first of the fall 2005 season to be canceled, and only two episodes were aired. He was subsequently cast as veterinarian Finn Dandridge on the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

O&#x27;Donnell featured prominently in the TNT miniseries &quot;The Company&quot; as CIA case officer Jack McAuliffe, a character who progressed from spoonfed Yale elitist to jaded, post-Cold War cynic. In 2008 O&#x27;Donnell appeared in &quot;Kit Kittredge: An American Girl&quot; as the titular character&#x27;s father Jack Kittredge, and in &quot;Max Payne&quot; as Jason Colvin.

Between 2009 and 2023, O&#x27;Donnell starred on &quot;&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;NCIS&quot;, as G. Callen, an NCIS Special Agent in charge of the Office of Special Projects Team stationed in Los Angeles. CBS describes Callen as &quot;a chameleon who transforms himself into whomever he needs to be to infiltrate the criminal underworld.&quot;

In 2010, O&#x27;Donnell appeared in the sequel to the 2001 movie &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Donnell married Caroline Fentress in April 1997 at St. Patrick Church in Washington, D.C. They have five children together.

<text>The University of Bucharest (UB) () is a public research university in Bucharest, Romania. It was founded in its current form on by a decree of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza to convert the former Princely Academy into the current University of Bucharest, making it one of the oldest Romanian universities. It is one of the five members of the &quot;Universitaria Consortium&quot; (a group of elite Romanian universities).

The University of Bucharest offers study programmes in Romanian and English and is classified as an &quot;advanced research and education university&quot; by the Ministry of Education. 

==History==

The University of Bucharest was founded by the Decree no. 765 of 4 July 1864 by Alexandru Ioan Cuza and is a leading academic centre and a significant point of reference in society.

The University of Bucharest is rich in history and has been actively contributing to the development and modernization of Romanian education, science, and culture since 1694. In 1694 Constantin Brâncoveanu, ruler of Wallachia, had founded the Princely Academy in Bucharest with lectures delivered in Greek. In 1776, Alexander Ypsilantis, ruler of Wallachia, reformed the curriculum of the Princely Academy, where courses of French, Italian, and Latin were now taught. After 1821, the Princely Academy was continued by the Saint Sava College. In 1857, Carol Davila and Nicolae Crețulescu created the National School of Medicine and Pharmacy. In 1859, the Faculty of Law was created.

In 1857, the foundation stone of the University Palace in Bucharest was laid.

On 4/16 July 1864, Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza established the University of Bucharest, bringing together the Faculties of Law, Sciences and Letters as one single body. In 1869, the Faculty of Medicine is created through the transformation of the National School of Medicine and Pharmacy. In the following years, new faculties were created: 1884 – the Faculty of Theology; 1906 – the Institute of Geology; 1913 – the Academic Institute for Electrotechnology; 1921 – the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine; 1923 – the Faculty of Pharmacy, 1924 – the Mina Minovici Institute of Forensic Medicine.

In 1956, student leaders, mainly from this university, planned a peaceful protest against Romania&#x27;s Communist regime but were forcibly prevented from carrying it out. (See Bucharest student movement of 1956).

For a while (in the 1950s and early 1960s), it was called the &quot;C. I. Parhon University&quot;, after Constantin Ion Parhon.

Most of the building is still intact, however during the bombardments of Bucharest in 1944, the central corpus of the building was heavily damaged and demolished due to Luftwaffe bombs, and was only re-constructed in 1969–1971. Other sections were also completed by 1980.

The area around the old University building (the University Square), adjacent to the C. A. Rosetti, Roman, Kogălniceanu, and Union squares was the scene of many riots, protests and clashes with the security forces during the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the months of April–June 1990, the University of Bucharest was the centre of anti-communist protests.

In 1996, Emil Constantinescu, the then rector of the University of Bucharest, was elected President of Romania, after defeating Ion Iliescu in the 1996 Romanian presidential election.

<text>USS &quot;Corregidor&quot; (AVG/ACV/CVE/CVU-58) was the fourth of fifty s built to serve the United States Navy during World War II. Launched in May 1943, and commissioned the following August, she was originally named for Anguilla Bay, in Maurelle Island, in the Alexander Archipelago, of Alaska.

==Design and description==

&quot;Corregidor&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered by two Skinner Uniflow reciprocating steam engines which drove two shafts, providing and enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more, which was often necessary during transport or especially training missions, due to the constant turnover of pilots and aircraft.

==Construction==
Ordered as HMS &quot;Atheling&quot;, she was laid down as &quot;Anguilla Bay&quot;, was reclassified ACV-58 on 20 August 1942, and launched as &quot;Corregidor&quot; on 12 May 1943, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, of Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. J. Hallett. She was reclassified CVE-58 on 15 July 1943, acquired by the Navy on 31 August 1943; and commissioned the same day.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Clearing San Diego, California, on 26 October 1943, &quot;Corregidor&quot; joined Carrier Division 24 (CarDiv 24) at Pearl Harbor for air strikes in the Gilbert Islands invasion from 10 November-6 December. She returned to San Diego, to undergo repairs and load aircraft and men, then resumed operations out of Pearl Harbor, with her division. From 22 January-3 March 1944, she sailed in the Marshall Islands operation, providing air cover for the invasion of Kwajalein.

&quot;Corregidor&quot; put to sea on 11 March 1944, for Guadalcanal, arriving there on 21 March. With the 3rd Fleet, she sortied on 30 March, to provide air cover for the landings on Emirau Island, returning to Port Purvis, on Florida Island, on 14 April. Two days later, she sailed to join the 7th Fleet for air operations at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), between 22 and 26 April, then put into Manus Island, for replenishment and antisubmarine patrols until 4 May. Embarking Commander, Carrier Division 24 for the Marianas operation, &quot;Corregidor&quot; provided combat air patrols and anti-aircraft support for the invasion of Saipan, from 15 to 25 June, with her aircraft accounting for at least eight enemy planes. She covered the logistics force off Eniwetok, from 1–3 July, then aided in the softening up bombardment of Guam, and provided air cover for the invasion until 28 July, when she returned to San Diego, for overhaul.

She worked on qualifying pilots in carrier operations at Pearl Harbor, from 12 October-21 November 1944. On 26 October, she formed as a hunter-killer group with EscDiv 64, around to check out reported enemy submarine movements between Pearl Harbor and California. On 2 January 1945, this group moved to patrol the area between Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, to protect heavy Allied shipping, returning to Pearl Harbor, on 13 February.

&quot;Corregidor&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor, on 27 February, to search for an overdue plane carrying Lieutenant General M. F. Harmon, USA, arriving at Majuro, on 20 March. From 21 March-27 April, she conducted an anti-submarine patrol in the vicinity of Japanese-held Wotje and Maloelap, in the Marshalls, then off Eniwetok. Future U.S. Congressman Ralph Hall flew off the Corregidor during this time.

===Post-War===
Returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 May 1945, &quot;Corregidor&quot; was assigned duty as a training ship in Hawaii, conducting carrier pilot qualifications until the end of the war. From 2 October 1945 – 10 January 1946, she alternated this duty with three voyages from Pearl Harbor to San Diego, to return homeward-bound servicemen. &quot;Corregidor&quot; cleared San Diego on 18 January 1946, for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there on 4 February. Here she was placed out of commission in reserve on 30 July 1946.

===Korea===
Recommissioned on 19 May 1951, &quot;Corregidor&quot; was assigned to operate with the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS). She ferried men, aircraft, and aviation cargo to NATO nations under the Mutual Defense Assistance Plan, but also made five voyages through the Panama Canal, to bring men and cargo to the United Nations forces in Korea, in 1952–1954. &quot;Corregidor&quot; was reclassified T-CVU-58 on 12 June 1955. When the Lebanon crisis broke in the summer of 1958, &quot;Corregidor&quot; was at Brindisi, Italy, and immediately lifted two reconnaissance planes of the 24th Infantry Division, and 10 helicopters to support the landings in Lebanon. Returning to the United States, the ship suffered hull damage in the Atlantic Ocean due to high seas on the night of 2 April 1958. She was transiting from Barcelona, Spain to NAS Pensacola, Florida, with 20 officers and 150 enlisted men. She made an emergency stop-over in the Azores. &quot;Corregidor&quot; was decommissioned on 4 September 1958, and sold for scrap on 28 April 1959.

==Awards==
&quot;Corregidor&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

The department was later absorbed into Westminster International University in Tashkent. 

It should not be confused with the similarly named London Academy of Diplomacy which was a different institution that operated from 2010-2016.

<text>USS &quot;Anzio&quot; (ACV/CVE/CVHE-57), was a of the United States Navy that saw service during World War II in the Pacific War. Originally classified as an auxiliary aircraft carrier ACV-57, the vessel was laid down in 1942, in Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company and initially named Alikula Bay, then renamed Coral Sea and redesignated CVE-57 in 1943. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; took part in naval operations supporting attacks on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, New Guinea and the Marianas Islands. In September 1944, she was renamed Anzio. As &quot;Anzio&quot;, the escort carrier took part in assaults on the Bonin Islands and Okinawa. Following the cessation of hostilities in 1945, &quot;Anzio&quot; was among the escort carriers used in Operation Magic Carpet, returning US soldiers to the United States. Following this service, she was laid up in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1946. The escort carrier was redesignated CVHE-57 on 15 June 1955, before being sold for scrap in 1959.

==Construction and service==

Originally classified as the auxiliary aircraft carrier ACV-57, the vessel&#x27;s keel was laid down on 12 December 1942, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company at their yard in Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1094. The vessel was initially named &quot;Alikula Bay&quot; on 22 January 1943, before being renamed &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on 3 April 1943. The ship was launched on 1 May 1943, sponsored by Martha Fletcher, wife of Admiral Frank J. Fletcher. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was redesignated CVE-57 on 15 July 1943, and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 27 August 1943, Captain Herbert W. Taylor, in command.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands===
On 24 September, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; departed Astoria, for shakedown in Puget Sound. The vessel arrived at San Diego, California, on 8 October, to load aircraft and hold flight operations off the California coast. The carrier sailed for Hawaii on 25 October, and upon arrival at Pearl Harbor, joined by sister ship for exercises off Oahu. On 10 November, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; steamed southwest to join the American forces about to invade the Gilbert Islands. She launched strikes on Makin Island from 20 to 28 November. When Tarawa Atoll had been captured, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; headed for Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 5 December. She paused to embark passengers and load aircraft for transport to the US and departed on 8 December. She arrived at Alameda, California, on 14 December, to take on new aircraft. She put to sea on 22 December, and steamed back to Hawaii. On 28 December, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; anchored at Pearl Harbor and began preparations for the impending assault on Kwajalein.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; was underway on 3 January 1944, for a series of exercises in Hawaiian waters. After final fitting out, she sailed on 22 January, in Task Group 52.9 (TG 52.9) and arrived in the vicinity of Kwajalein, on 31 January, two days after aircraft of the Fast Carrier Task Force began pounding airfields on the atoll. She provided direct and indirect air support for the amphibious landings. On 24 February, the escort carrier set course for Eniwetok, but was recalled to Hawaii, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, on 3 March.

===Solomon Islands and New Guinea===
After a brief respite, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; got underway again on 11 March and proceeded to the Solomon Islands. She anchored at Tulagi, on 21 March, and resupplied before sailing again on 30 March, for Emirau Island. From 1–11 April, she launched aircraft in support of forces occupying Emirau and returned to Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons on 15 April. The next day, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; left Tulagi, to assist in the reconquest of New Guinea. On 19 April, she joined TG 78.2, which was formed to support Allied footholds at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) and Aitape. Her aircraft joined in strikes on 22 April, and on 26 April, the escort carrier sailed to Seeadler Harbor, for replenishment and on 7 May, headed for Espiritu Santo, for availability.

===Marianas Islands and Bonin Islands operations===
Following the completion of repairs, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; sailed on 8 June, for Kwajalein, the staging point for the invasion of the Marianas Islands. The American forces sortied on 10 June and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was among the carriers providing air support for the landings by the 2nd Marine Division on Saipan. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; endured numerous Japanese air attacks during the next few days receiving minor damage. The carrier moved south to Guam, on 17 June, to begin softening up operations against that island but returned to Saipan, the next day to assist the bogged-down American forces. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and her escorts retired to Eniwetok, on 28 June, but returned to Saipan, on 4 July. Her airwing made further airstrikes before she put into Eniwetok, on 15 July, for repairs to her engines. Ultimately, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was ordered back to the United States, for a much-needed overhaul and the carrier sailed on 23 July. Two days later, she paused at Kwajalein, to unload most of her aircraft and ammunition and then continued via Pearl Harbor, for the naval base at San Diego. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; arrived in California, on 9 August, and entered drydock at San Diego, on 31 August. While she was still undergoing an overhaul, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; received word that her name was being changed to &quot;Anzio&quot; as of 15 September.

&quot;Anzio&quot; held sea trials off the California coast and was ready to sail for the western Pacific on 16 September. She reached Hawaii, on 23 September, and entered Pearl Harbor, for tender availability. On 8 October, the carrier began a series of training exercises, and on 16 October, she set out for Eniwetok. There, &quot;Anzio&quot; joined a hunter-killer group and carried out an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) mission while she was en route to Ulithi. On 4 November, she was ordered to assist the light cruiser which had been torpedoed in the Philippine Sea. When &quot;Anzio&quot; was relieved by , she resumed her ASW patrols and worked at that task through mid-February 1945, when she steamed to Iwo Jima. 

&quot;Anzio&quot; resumed combat support operations on 16 February. Three days later, she launched a strike to the north on Chichi Jima, in the Bonin Islands. From 19 February-4 March, she followed a schedule of launching her first flight just before sunset and recovering her last just after dawn. During these nocturnal operations, she completed 106 sorties without a single accident. She departed the Iwo Jima area on 8 March, and entered San Pedro Bay, at Leyte, on 12 March. After 10 days of upkeep and being joined by a newly redeployed VC-13 from , she sailed to join the invasion of Okinawa.

===Okinawa and post war===
After providing air cover for an Okinawa-bound amphibious group, &quot;Anzio&quot; joined other forces in the vicinity of Kerama Retto, in seizing that island group to provide an advanced base for the Fleet. The Okinawa attack began on 1 April, and she remained on the line until she retired to Ulithi, on 30 April, for repairs to her rudder bearings. On 21 May, the carrier resumed ASW operations in the Okinawa area. This role ended on 17 June, when she sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for upkeep. 

&quot;Anzio&quot; left the Philippines, on 6 July, to begin what proved to be her last stint of combat duty. She joined TG 30.8 and positioned herself about east of Tokyo. She made ASW patrols in support of Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s attacks on the Japanese home islands. She received word of the Japanese capitulation on 15 August, and sailed for Guam, on 19 August. After refitting and training new flight crews, the escort carrier headed for Okinawa. From that point, she was to provide air cover and ASW patrol services for transports carrying occupation troops to Korea. On 8 September, she anchored at Jinsen, Korea, whence she provided air support for the landings of the occupation force. She left Korea, on 13 September, and returned to Okinawa. On 19 September, she broke her homeward-bound pennant, became a member of a Magic Carpet group and reached San Francisco, on 30 September.

While at San Francisco, &quot;Anzio&quot; was modified to provide maximum passenger accommodations. The carrier made two trips to the western Pacific and back, one to Pearl Harbor and one to Shanghai, China, to shuttle American troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. She arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 23 December, and ended the year at that port. On 18 January 1946, &quot;Anzio&quot; sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. She paused at San Francisco, then continued southward to transit the Panama Canal before finally reaching the east coast. &quot;Anzio&quot; was placed out of commission on 5 August, and became a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthed at Norfolk. The ship was redesignated CVHE-57 on 15 June 1955. &quot;Anzio&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and sold to Master Metals Co., on 24 November, for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Coral Sea&quot;/&quot;Anzio&quot; received eleven Navy Unit Commendations and nine battle stars for service in World War II. The Secretary of the Navy commended the men of &quot;Anzio&quot; &quot;For outstanding heroism in action against enemy Japanese forces in the air, ashore and afloat. Operating in the most advanced areas&quot;

<doc id="553995" wikidata="Q7868057" url="?curid=553995" title="USS Cape Esperance">
<text>USS &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; (CVE-88) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Battle of Cape Esperance, an inconclusive naval engagement in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in March 1944, and commissioned in April, and served as a replenishment carrier. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in August 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. However, she was recommissioned in August 1950, and assigned to become an auxiliary vessel as a part of Military Sealift Command. She was decommissioned again in January 1959, and ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in May 1959.

==Design and description==
&quot;Cape Esperance&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy war losses sustained in the early engagements of the Pacific War. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Due to &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; serving as a replenishment of transport carrier throughout most of her time in service, it frequently carried up to sixty aircraft during these missions, around the maximum amount at which the flight deck would still be functional. She was designed to accommodate 764 crew, but in wartime, her complement inevitably crept over that number. A reasonable estimate puts the number of crew typically on board a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier at around 910 to 916 men.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Tananek Bay&quot; (a misspelling of &quot;Tonowek Bay&quot;), as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The escort carrier was laid down on 11 December 1943, MC hull 1125, the thirty-fourth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-88. On 6 November 1943, she was renamed &quot;Cape Esperance&quot;, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. She was named after the Battle of Cape Esperance, an early and inconclusive naval battle fought in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. She was launched on 3 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. W. M. McDade; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 April 1944.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She then underwent two transport missions, ferrying new aircraft to bases in the South and West Pacific, and returning to the West Coast with damaged aircraft. After returning from her second transport run, she was assigned to Task Group 30.8, the replenishment escort carrier group. She was loaded with replacement aircraft at San Francisco, and departed on 5 October 1944. She rendezvoused with the other replenishment carriers on 2 November, and provided replacement aircraft to the Fast Carrier Task Force operating against Japanese positions on Leyte and Luzon. The replenishment carriers would meet with the frontline carriers at designated rendezvous days, during which supplies and aircraft would be transferred. She was based from and received additional replacement aircraft at Ulithi and Guam.

The Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel, and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. As a part of Task Unit 30.8.14, she rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; was carrying thirty-nine planes on her flight deck, along with another twelve stored in her hangar deck. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 01:00 in the night, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded.
As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10, just after noon. He ordered his fleet to move to the next morning&#x27;s planned rendezvous spot, approximately northwest, and comfortably safe from the typhoon&#x27;s impacts. Two hours later, he instead ordered his fleet to proceed due southwards, from where the fleet was located. This brought the fleet directly into the typhoon&#x27;s core. To make matters worse for the Third Fleet, Halsey ordered the fleet to proceed northwards at 22:20, putting the fleet in the quadrant of the typhoon with the highest winds. Blurry data and observations meant that command had little idea of where the typhoon actually was, with some weather maps pinning the typhoon&#x27;s center some away, even whilst the fleet sailed directly into the eye. Attached to the Third Fleet, &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; followed, although Captain Bockius had begun preparations on 17 December. The aircraft on the flight deck had been tied down, weight had been transferred downwards to lower the ship&#x27;s center of gravity, the hatches had been battened down, and the crew had been informed to stay on the port side of the carrier to counteract any list in the ship. The ship&#x27;s aircraft elevators had also been lowered, in the hopes that this transferred weight would negate the lists generated from the wind.

At 07:00, on the morning of 18 December, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon&#x27;s path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 09:52, &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; began maneuvering independently of the task force. Multiple rolls of 36° were recorded, and the occasional roll of 39° frightened the ship&#x27;s command. The ship&#x27;s officers began discussing the possibility of jettisoning the aircraft on the flight deck to make the ship less top-heavy, before discarding the idea. The typhoon&#x27;s winds solved the weight problem, by ripping the aircraft on the flight deck from their restraints, and carrying them into the ocean. However, at 12:28, an aircraft ended up stuck on the forward starboard stack, and caught on fire, forcing an evacuation of the bridge. Fortunately for the crew, as the carrier rocked and yawed, the plane was dislodged and carried overboard. The fire sparked by the aircraft, which had threatened to become a conflagration because of the aircraft&#x27;s fuel tanks, ended up being extinguished by the rain.

The loss of most of the planes on the flight deck meant that &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; no longer threatened to keel over. At 16:00, another plane on the flight deck broke loose, and plummeted through the open forward aircraft elevator, landing on another plane. Fortunately for the crew, a fire did not result from this collision. As the carrier emerged from the typhoon, of the thirty-nine aircraft fastened to the flight deck, only seven remained. Although all of the planes in the hangar deck survived, eight planes were struck due to damage. As a result, she only had eleven replacement planes which she could deliver to the battered Third Fleet. Although 790 crewmen perished in the typhoon, none were from &quot;Cape Esperance&quot;. Her flight deck, damaged by the blaze, required major repairs.

She continued her duties as a replenishment carrier through the New Year, although repairs were made at bases in Guam and Ulithi. She retired from the replenishment carrier fleet in February 1945, heading back to the West Coast. There, she loaded aircraft, which she ferried to Guam. Until news of the surrender of Japan broke, she acted as a transport carrier, transporting newly minted aircraft from the United States to the West Pacific, in order to replace heavy war losses over Okinawa and the Japanese home islands. Whilst she was transporting aircraft, Captain Patrick Henry, Jr. took over command of the vessel on 3 May.

===Post-war and Cold War===
Following the end of the war, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She first made a run from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, ferrying aircraft and veterans to San Francisco, where she arrived on 11 September 1945. Until mid-1946, she made several such Magic Carpet runs, touching stops throughout the Pacific. After being released from the Magic Carpet fleet, she proceeded to Bremerton, Washington, where she was decommissioned on 22 August 1946, and subsequently mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Cape Esperance&quot; was recommissioned on 5 August 1950 under the identification T-CVE-88, as an aircraft transport carrier serving under the Military Sealift Command. Most of her weapons were stripped from her hull, and she was operated by a mostly civilian crew. Immediately after being recommissioned, she began delivering aircraft to Japan, where they would participant in the Korean War. For the next nine years, &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; fulfilled a variety of duties, including supporting nuclear tests at Eniwetok, and ferrying aircraft to the Royal Thai Air Force. She engaged in an average of nine transpacific voyages per year, reinforcing forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, as well as U.S. assets in the Pacific. In 1952, she steamed for Hong Kong, where she evacuated planes previously belonging to the Republic of China that were hastily sold to Civil Air Transport to prevent being seized by People&#x27;s Republic of China. She was reclassified as a utility aircraft transport carrier, T-CVU-88, on 12 June 1955, and began conducting transatlantic voyages, ferrying aircraft to bases in Western Europe. She then returned to the Pacific, and proceeded to transport aircraft to Pakistan in 1956.

She was decommissioned a second time on 15 January 1959, as the operation of &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers became less and less economical. She was abandoned in favor of s, who served for another decade as transport carriers, before they too became obsolete and uneconomical. She was sold for scrapping on 14 May 1959, and ultimately broken up in Japan throughout January 1961.

<text>USS &quot;Wake Island&quot; (CVE-65) was a of the United States Navy.

She was laid down under a United States Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1102) on 6 February 1943 at Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipyards; launched on 15 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Frederick Carl Sherman, the wife of Rear Admiral Frederick Sherman; and commissioned on 7 November 1943, with Captain Hames R. Tague in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===

====Atlantic====
Following commissioning, &quot;Wake Island&quot; received supplies, ammunition, and gasoline at Astoria, Oregon, and got underway on 27 November 1943 for Puget Sound and anchored the following day at Bremerton, Washington, where she continued to load supplies and ammunition. The carrier operated in the Puget Sound area conducting structural firing tests and making stops at Port Townsend, Sinclair Inlet, and Seattle before sailing south on 6 December. She arrived at San Francisco, California on 10 December, took on fuel, and, two days later, headed for San Diego, arriving there on 14 December for shakedown and availability. Before departing, the carrier took on board the personnel and planes of Composite Squadron 69 (VC-69).

On 11 January 1944, &quot;Wake Island&quot; got underway and steamed, via the Panama Canal, to Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving at Norfolk, Virginia on 26 January. Following availability, the carrier sailed on 14 February for New York City in company with , , and .

On 16 February, after loading supplies and embarking Army and Navy officers for transportation, &quot;Wake Island&quot; set course for Recife, Brazil, the first stop on her voyage to Karachi, India. She arrived at Recife on 1 March and made stops at Cape Town, South Africa, and Diego Suarez Harbor, Madagascar, before arriving at Karachi on 29 March. The carrier began her return trip on 3 April and arrived back at Norfolk on 12 May.

She spent the remainder of May and part of June undergoing alterations and an overhaul. She then took on board the planes and personnel of VC-58 and, on 15 June, set course toward Bermuda for duty as the nucleus of Task Group 22.6 (TG 22.6), a combined, air-and-surface, anti-submarine, hunter-killer group. The highlight of her cruise came on 2 July, when one of her Grumman TBM Avengers intercepted the off the coast of Africa between the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, making its way home after an unsuccessful patrol in the Gulf of Guinea. The pilot, Ensign Frederick L. Moore, braved heavy anti-aircraft fire from &quot;U-543&quot;, while making two bombing attacks which sank the U-boat. However, no evidence appeared to confirm the kill, so the carrier and her escorts spent the next two weeks hunting the already-destroyed submarine.

TG 22.6 began her next serious encounter with the enemy two minutes before noon on 2 August, when sighted a U-boat&#x27;s conning tower some away. She and were detached to investigate, while all planes in the area were recalled. An Avenger, armed with depth bombs, was catapulted at 1209. At 1235, a torpedo, apparently fired by a second submarine, hit &quot;Fiske&quot; midships and broke her in two. The ships of the group managed to maneuver clear of two more torpedoes which were fired at the force. The first report of casualties listed 4 dead, 26 missing, and 55 seriously injured. was detached to support &quot;Howard &quot;and later to pick up survivors. As the group was preparing to avenge the loss of &quot;Fiske&quot;, heavy fog and rain stopped all operations.

On 4 August, TG 22.6 was dissolved, and four days later, &quot;Wake Island&quot; made rendezvous with Convoy UC-32 as it steamed westward. She left the convoy on the 11th and headed for Hampton Roads. She arrived at Norfolk on the 15th for alterations and repairs which lasted through the 25th. Following post-repair trials and a brief availability, the escort carrier sailed on 29 August for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to relieve on carrier aircraft qualification operation duty which lasted until 30 October. The next day, the carrier sailed for Norfolk with and as escorts, and arrived on 1 November for a period of availability.

====Pacific====

=====Philippines=====

On the 11th, she stood out of Norfolk in company with and escorts bound via the Panama Canal for the west coast. The carrier entered San Francisco Bay on 28 November, and moored at the Naval Air Station Alameda, California, where she embarked two new aircraft squadrons before heading for Hawaii the following day. She moored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 5 December, detached squadrons VC-9 and VPB-149, and disembarked personnel, planes, and equipment. Ten days later, &quot;Wake Island&quot;, her flight deck laden with cargo and unable to launch or receive planes, got underway for the Admiralty Islands with escorts and . She arrived at Manus Island on 27 December, discharged all cargo and passengers, sailed for the Palau Islands, and arrived at Kossol Roads on New Year&#x27;s Day 1945. Late that evening, she loaded ammunition from a barge and got underway at 0642, bound for the Philippines and the forthcoming invasion of Luzon, in company with a tremendous fleet which had gathered for the operation.

Two days later, &quot;Wake Island&quot; passed through Surigao Strait and launched both SNAP (anti-snooper air patrol) and LCAP (local combat air patrol) aircraft. On 4 January 1945, she was operating in the Sulu Sea and launched a three-hour SNAP. The American planes sighted a single-engine Japanese float plane on the water off the southeastern tip of Panay Island. It appeared to be in the hands of a salvage crew. Two of the scout planes made two strafing runs each and left the plane riddled and the salvage crew dispersed.

The Fleet entered Panay Gulf about southeast of Manila. &quot;Wake Island&#x27;s&quot; surface search radar was jammed by enemy transmission, and the escort carrier went to general quarters at 1714. One minute later, a Japanese single-engine plane appeared overhead in a steep diving attack on , some away. Fire immediately flared from that carrier&#x27;s flight and hangar decks, and after 20 minutes, her crew abandoned &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; under a dense cloud of black smoke. She burned with explosions of ammunition and was finally scuttled astern of the fleet by a torpedo from an American destroyer.

On 5 January, &quot;Wake Island&quot; received 19 survivors of &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; who had been rescued by . The ship went to general quarters with bogies on the radar screen, but three threatened raids failed to develop. At 1502, eight LCAP fighters from &quot;Wake Island&quot; pounced upon a division of Japanese Army fighters. When the melee was over, the Americans claimed three certain kills and a probable without suffering any loss themselves. In all, &quot;Wake Island&quot; launched three LCAP&#x27;s during daylight. At 1655, the ship again went to general quarters to repel an air attack and for the next hour was under severe attack. At one time, six single-engine planes were simultaneously diving on carriers off &quot;Wake Island&quot;″s port side. Five were knocked down by anti-aircraft fire, narrowly missing their targets, but one managed a hit on . She caught fire and dropped behind, but her efficient damage control efforts enabled her to resume her position in the formation in only 51 minutes, with her flight deck out of commission. During the attack, at least 10 enemy planes splashed within of &quot;Wake Island&quot;, and her own anti-aircraft gunners claimed three.

On 13 January, two enemy planes attacked , cruising about astern of &quot;Wake Island&quot;. One of the attackers was shot down, but the other scored a hit which briefly slowed that carrier. She soon regained speed and controlled a fire on her hangar deck without losing her position in the formation. Four days later, &quot;Wake Island&quot; was detached and left Lingayen Gulf in TG 77.14, a force consisting of eight escort carriers and their screen to retire to Ulithi, Caroline Islands. She anchored at Ulithi&#x27;s southern anchorage from 23 to 31 January, undergoing availability and preparing for further operations. During this period, her home port was changed from Norfolk to Puget Sound, Bremerton, Washington.

=====Iwo Jima=====
On 10 February 1945, the carrier got underway to join TG 52.2, which had been established to provide air cover and support while escorting major units to the Volcano Islands and then to furnish naval gunfire, spotting, and direct air support for landing forces. The following day, she steamed to an area off Saipan-Tinian where rehearsals for the invasion took place. On 13 February, &quot;Wake Island&quot;″s commanding officer, Capt. Austen V. Magly, was designated OTC of Task Unit 52.2.1 (TU 52.2.1).

On 14 February, the carrier set course for Iwo Jima and, two days later, arrived at her operating area from the southwestern tip of Iwo Jima. Shortly after daylight, the heavy bombardment group began shelling shore installations on the island. Planes from &quot;Wake Island&quot; flew spotting sorties, attacked defensive works with rocket fire, and flew local antisubmarine patrols and hydrographic observation flights over the beaches. D-day for the invasion of Iwo Jima was 19 February; and on that day, &quot;Wake Island&quot; operated as before, flying 56 spotting sorties and firing 87 rockets.

, a carrier in her group, was sunk by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 21 February. The next day, &quot;Wake Island&quot; was detached and ordered to proceed to a rendezvous point east of Iwo Jima. There, she refueled on 23 February and set course to return to the operating area east of Iwo Jima. The following day, she took station some from the southern tip of Iwo Jima and flew 55 spotting sorties, expending 205 rockets. In the ensuing weeks, &quot;Wake Island&quot; continued her operations supporting the Marines. On 5 March, she received a message of special interest from Commander, TU 52.2.1, Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague: &quot;If your ship is as good as your Air Department and Squadron, it is a standout. I have seen nearly all the combat CVEs&#x27; work and I must say the Wake tops them all for efficiency, smoothness and good judgement. I hope we are together again.&quot;

After 24 consecutive days of operations, &quot;Wake Island&quot; retired on 8 March from her station off Iwo Jima and rendezvoused with west of the island. The next day, they headed for Ulithi and arrived there on 14 March.

=====Okinawa=====
The carrier spent the next five days at anchor, preparing for another operation. She got underway on 21 March to supply air support for forces about to invade Okinawa. On 25 March, she arrived in the operating area roughly south of Okinawa Jima and began sending flights over Kerama Retto beaches and Okinawa. &quot;Wake Island&quot; continued her support of the campaign through the initial landings at Okinawa on 1 April.

On the 3rd, the carrier was operating southeast of Okinawa. At 1722, she completed the landing of her fifth spotting sortie, and all her planes were back on board. Eight minutes later, she went to general quarters, and enemy bogies were reported. At 1742, a violent wave hit the ship while planes were being moved for spotting on the flight deck. Two General Motors FM-2 Wildcats were thrown off the flight deck into the water. Two fighters were flipped over on their backs, and two others received severe damage when tossed about.

At the same instant, two Wildcats broke loose from their lashings on the hangar deck and collided, with major damage to both. At 1744, a Japanese single-engine aircraft plunged at the ship from a high angle and missed the port forward corner of the flight deck, exploding in the water abreast the forecastle. Thirty seconds later, a second similar aircraft whistled down on the starboard side at tremendous speed, narrowly missing the bridge structure and plunging into the water about from the hull. The aircraft exploded after impact, ripping a hole in the ship&#x27;s side below the waterline, about long and about from top to bottom, and making many shrapnel holes. Parts of the aircraft were thrown onto the forecastle and into the gun sponsons. Various compartments were flooded, and the shell plating cracked between the first and second decks. Other shell plating buckled, and the main condensers were flooded with salt water, contaminating some 30,000 US gallons (110 m³) of fresh water and 70,000 US gallons (260 m³) of fuel oil. At 1824, salting made it necessary to secure the forward engine, and the ship proceeded on one propeller. Remarkably, there were no injuries; and, by 2140, corrective measures had been taken, and the ship was again steaming on both engines. The next day, &quot;Wake Island&quot; steamed to Kerama Retto anchorage with and . While she remained there undergoing inspection by the fleet salvage officer, special precautions were taken to guard against possible Japanese suicide swimmers from islands of the cluster not yet secured.

The carrier set course for Guam on 6 April 1945, and, four days later arrived at Apra Harbor for repairs in drydock which lasted through 20 May. The next day, the ship, in company with , headed for Okinawa where she resumed her mission of supporting the troops on the island.

&quot;Wake Island&quot; was then detached on 2 June, and escorted by , proceeded to Kerama Retto for replenishment. At Kaika Harbor, Kerama Retto, she loaded bombs, rockets, and dry and fresh provisions, despite many enemy aircraft in the vicinity. The carrier made rendezvous with for refueling, and once her tanks were full, returned to the operating area off Okinawa on 6 June 1945.

The following day, &quot;Wake Island&quot;, as part of the task unit, engaged in strikes on Sakashima Gunto. was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, and was attacked by a second. &quot;Wake Island&quot; continued on support operations until 15 June when Rear Admiral Durgin landed on the carrier for an official visit. In a ceremony held on the flight deck, he presented citations and awards to 16 pilots of VOC-1.

The following day, &quot;Wake Island&quot; and &quot;Dennis&quot; were detached, proceeded independently for Kerama Retto, and arrived there on 17 June. She was replenished and then returned to the area southwest of Okinawa to resume flight operations. Two days later, &quot;Wake Island&quot; received a message detaching her from TG 32.1 due to battle damage received on 3 April and a subsequent finding by the Bureau of Ships that &quot;pending yardwork, this vessel is considered unsafe for operations in a forward area.&quot; She headed for Guam and conducted firing practices and launched LASP sorties en route. Upon her arrival at Port Apra on 24 June, all personnel of squadron VOC-1 were transferred to Naval Air Base Agana.

From 25 June-3 July, &quot;Wake Island&quot;, loaded with nine Grumman F6F Hellcats, 24 Vought F4U Corsairs, 11 Avengers, and two Piper L-4s, made a round-trip to Okinawa and delivered aircraft with 46 ferry pilots to Tactical Air Force, Yontan Field, Okinawa.

Arriving back at Guam, the carrier unloaded ammunition and aviation spares and took on board 300 sacks of United States mail along with 10 Corsair and 20 Curtiss SB2C Helldiver duds for transportation, then sailed for Pearl Harbor in company with and . On 10 July, she detached &quot;Bull&quot; and &quot;Cape Esperance&quot; and proceeded independently to Hawaii. A week later, the ship arrived at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, where she unloaded her cargo and took on board 138 enlisted men and 49 officers as passengers to the continental United States. On 18 July, &quot;Wake Island&quot; cleared the channel at Pearl Harbor, bound for southern California. She arrived at San Diego, California on 25 July, and discharged her passengers and planes.

===Post-War===
While moored at North Island, San Diego, the carrier took on board six Avengers, 10 Wildcats, 53 officers, and 13 men of VC-75 for training and carrier aircraft landing qualifications off San Nicholas Island. She continued to conduct flight qualifications through December 1945.

This period was distinguished on 6 November when the first jet-propelled landing on an aircraft carrier was made on &quot;Wake Island&quot;. Personnel of VF-41 and representatives of Ryan Aeronautical came on board during the morning of 5 November, and the escort carrier got underway from the Naval Air Station, San Diego, in company with . For two days, she conducted tests and landing qualifications for the FR Fireball. Ensign J. C. West took off from the USS &quot;Wake Island&quot; in a Ryan FR-1 Fireball, a combination prop-jet design, and soon experienced problems with the Wright R-1820-72W Cyclone radial piston engine. Before the reciprocating powerplant failed completely, he started the General Electric I-16 jet engine and returned to the ship, thus making the first ever landing by jet power alone on a carrier.

In 1946, &quot;Wake Island&quot; prepared for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 5 April; struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the 17th; and subsequently sold for scrap to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 19 April 1946.

<text>USS &quot;White Plains&quot; (CVE-66) was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier of the United States Navy. She was named after the 1776 Battle of White Plains.

She was laid down on 11 February 1943 at Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1103) as Elbour Bay&quot; (ACV-66); renamed White Plains&quot; on 3 April 1943; redesignated CVE-66 on 15 July 1943; launched on 27 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Marc A. Mitscher; delivered to the Navy on 15 November 1943 at Astoria, Oregon; and commissioned that same day, Captain Oscar A. Weller in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
The USS &quot;White Plains&quot; completed her outfitting at Astoria, Oregon, on 4 December 1943, and then she began shakedown training on 8 December. At the conclusion of her initial cruise, the warship entered San Diego on 21 December. On 30 December, she returned to sea, bound for the Gilbert Islands. She arrived at Tarawa Atoll on 11 January 1944 and unloaded the aircraft she had transported. On 17 January, the ship headed back to Oahu, arriving in Pearl Harbor six days later. Following a four-day turnaround period, the &quot;White Plains&quot; again set course for the Central Pacific to provide aircraft logistics support for the Marshall Islands operation. By the time she reached Tarawa on 3 February, the undefended Majuro Atoll had been occupied, and the Japanese garrison at Kwajalein Atoll had been all but subdued. On the next day, she got underway for Majuro where she arrived on 5 February. From there, the escort carrier moved on to Kwajalein for a brief visit before heading back to Hawaii. The &quot;White Plains&quot; stopped briefly at Oahu before continuing on toward the West Coast on 23 February. She arrived at Alameda, California, on San Francisco Bay on 3 March.

While off the West Coast, the &quot;White Plains&quot; conducted operational training for her own ship&#x27;s company and carrier qualifications for three air squadrons. In April, she embarked her own permanently assigned air unit, Composite Squadron 4 (VC-4), composed of 16 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and 12 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo planes. She departed the West Coast from the San Diego Naval Base on 24 April, and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 May. During the next month, the &quot;White Plains&quot; conducted air operations and amphibious support training out of Pearl Harbor.

At the end of May, the &quot;White Plains&quot; steamed out of port in company with units of the Task Forces assembled to invade the Mariana Islands. The portion of the Fleet containing the &quot;White Plains&quot; sortied from Eniwetok Atoll, and during the voyage from there to the Marianas, her aircraft provided antisubmarine warfare patrols and part of the combat air patrol. During the assault on Saipan, her planes continued to cover the Fleet against submarine and air attack, strafed the beaches, and spotted shellfire for gunfire support ships. They helped repulse at least three major enemy air attacks. On 17 June, while helping to fight off those raids, her antiaircraft gunners earned their first definite kill. Later, VC-4 Avengers successfully torpedoed an enemy transport during a sweep of the island of Rota.

The USS &quot;White Plains&quot; departed the combat zone on 2 July but, after a week at Eniwetok, returned to the Marianas with her air squadron upgraded to a total of 28 aircraft. During her second tour of duty in the Marianas, the escort carrier supported the Tinian assault late in July. Her planes carried out sortie after sortie in support of the troops ashore and over the ships assembled, but the &quot;White Plains&quot; herself suffered no enemy attacks. Her heavy flight schedule proved grueling to air squadron and ship&#x27;s company alike.

She completed her participation during the first week in August and departed the Marianas and headed for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. She arrived in Segond Channel on 16 August and began preparations for the invasion of the Palau Islands. Those preparations included amphibious support training in the Solomon Islands. The &quot;White Plains&quot; and ten other aircraft carriers moved into the vicinity of the Palaus during the second week of September. Their planes provided a portion of the prelanding bombardment and support for the troops after the assault on 15 September. In contrast to the Marianas campaign and later operations, the Palaus, though extremely difficult on the troops ashore, brought little opposition to the ships in the waters surrounding the islands. No enemy air attacks developed because the Japanese were husbanding their aircraft for the defense of the Philippines, and as a result of Japan&#x27;s new strategic concept of defense in depth at some distance from the beaches, few shore batteries were sited near enough to the coast to fire upon ships. On 21 September, the &quot;White Plains&quot; joined the forces detached from the Palau operation for the occupation of Ulithi Atoll, which to everyone&#x27;s relief, was undefended.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====

In October 1944, after repairs at the naval base at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands, USS &quot;White Plains&quot; headed for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte. The initial assault went forward on 20 October. Aircraft from &quot;White Plains&quot; provided air support for the troops and ASW and combat air patrols for the ships assembled in Leyte Gulf. However, because of the strategic importance of the Philippines which lay athwart their lines of communication with the East Indies, the Japanese chose to oppose the landings with their surface fleet. They launched their surface counterattack in three distinct phases. While a decoy force of carriers under Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa moved south from Japan in an attempt to draw off Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet and the large carriers, the forces under Vice Admirals Shōji Nishimura and Kiyohide Shima attempted to force the Surigao Strait from the south, and Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force tried to sneak through the Central Philippines and transit the hopefully unguarded San Bernardino Strait. The Center Force, by far the strongest of the enemy fleets involved, consisted of five battleships - including the huge superbattleships and - 11 heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and 19 destroyers. By the time Kurita&#x27;s Center Force cleared the San Bernardino Strait on 25 October, it had been reduced by four heavy cruisers and the battleship &quot;Musashi&quot;. Three heavy cruisers had fallen prey to American submarine attacks in the Palawan Passage on 23 October, and &quot;Musashi&quot; and succumbed to Task Force 38&#x27;s air attacks in the Sibuyan Sea on the following day. &quot;Musashi&quot; sank there, and &quot;Myōkō&quot; headed back to Brunei Bay, heavily damaged. In addition, on the night of 24 October and 25 October, Vice Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s old battleships in Leyte Gulf obliterated Nishimura&#x27;s force and sent Shima&#x27;s packing.

In the meantime, after Admiral Halsey received information indicating that a battered Center Force had begun retirement, Ozawa&#x27;s decoy force finally managed to draw the American carriers off to the north. However, Kurita&#x27;s retrograde movement proved to be only temporary, and he once again reversed course and headed back toward San Bernardino Strait. With Oldendorf regrouping his warships in Leyte Gulf and Halsey off chasing the Japanese Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers, only three Task Groups—composed of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts—remained off Samar island between Kurita and Leyte Gulf. USS &quot;White Plains&quot; was an element of &quot;Taffy 3,&quot; the northmost of the three Task Groups, and the one which bore the brunt of Kurita&#x27;s surface onslaught. &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, first learned of Kurita&#x27;s presence when, at 0637, a pilot on routine air patrol spotted Kurita&#x27;s task force and attacked it with depth charges. Rear Admiral Sprague was incredulous about the presence of the Japanese Navy, and he demanded identification verification—which came, disconcertingly enough, when the enemy battleships&#x27; pagoda-style masts loomed over the horizon.

&quot;Yamato&quot; opened fire at 0659 at an estimated range of 34,500 yards (17 nautical miles), targeting &quot;White Plains&quot; with her first four salvoes. &quot;Yamato&quot;″s third salvo was a close straddle landing at 07:04. One shell from this salvo exploded beneath the turn of &quot;White Plains&quot; port bilge near frame 142, near her aft (starboard) engine room. While the ship was not struck directly, the mining effect of the under-keel explosion severely damaged her hull, deranged her starboard machinery and tripped most of the circuit breakers in her electrical network. Prompt and effective damage control restored power and communications within three minutes and she was able to remain in formation by overspeeding her port engine to compensate. The black smoke resulting from the sudden loss of boiler intake air pressure convinced &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Nagato&quot; (which was also firing her main battery at &quot;White Plains&quot; at the time) that they had scored a direct hit and they shifted fire to other targets. For the next two and one-half hours, the Japanese force chased &quot;Taffy 3&quot; southward and subjected the escort carriers and their counterattacking screen to a heavy-caliber cannonade. The aircraft carriers&#x27; warplanes fought back, even making dummy runs on the Japanese ships to slow the ships&#x27; speed of advance after expending all their bombs, torpedoes, and ammunition. During their counterattacks, , , and were sunk by gunfire. Later, was sunk by gunfire as well, while , , , and suffered heavy damage.

During the surface phase of the action &quot;White Plains&quot;″s 5-inch gun crew claimed six hits on heavy cruiser . It was initially believed that one of these hits caused the Chokai&#x27;s Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes to explode, crippling &quot;Chōkai&quot; and making it vulnerable to air attack. However, the 2019 discovery by the RV Petrel of the wreck of the &quot;Chōkai&quot; with her torpedoes intact disproved this theory. &quot;Chōkai&quot; was later sunk by planes from , an escort carrier of Taffy 2. &#x27;s detailed action report states that &quot;Chokai&quot;″s immobilizing damage resulted from a bomb hit at 0851.

The Japanese surface force broke off its pursuit from 0912–0917 hours, and after milling around in apparent confusion for a time, retired northward to San Bernardino Strait. The retreat by Kurita&#x27;s surface force, however, did not end the ordeal for &quot;White Plains&quot; and her fellow warships. After a 90-minute respite, they suffered harassment from a different quarter. At 1050 hours, a formation of nine Japanese Navy Zeke fighters appeared and began simultaneous &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. Two of them singled out &quot;White Plains&quot; as their victim. Her antiaircraft gunners responded, hitting one of the intruders, which immediately changed course and crashed into , which eventually sank. The other aircraft continued on toward &quot;White Plains&quot;, but her antiaircraft guns finally brought him down yards astern, scattering debris all over the ship&#x27;s deck and sides, but causing only 11 relatively minor casualties. In the meantime, and USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; also suffered from &quot;kamikaze&quot; crashes, but neither of these proved to be fatal to the carriers. That attack proved to be the final combat action of USS &quot;White Plains&quot;. She steamed to the naval base at Manus with the other surviving carriers, arriving on 31 October. After an inspection of the damage, it was decided that the battered escort carrier should return to the United States for complete repairs. Accordingly, she departed from Manus on 6 November and headed to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego Harbor on 27 November; repairs began immediately.

Ready for action once more, USS &quot;White Plains&quot; steamed out of San Diego on 19 January 1945. However, concern about the lingering effects of the hull and machinery damage suffered at Samar kept her off the front lines and she was assigned to ferrying replacement aircraft from their factories in the United States to bases in the western Pacific for the remainder of the war. During the last months of the war, &quot;White Plains&quot; visited Kwajalein, Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), Ulithi, Saipan, Guam, Leyte, and Pearl Harbor. All had been scenes of major combat actions in the past, but by this time they had become rear areas. The closest approach to the fighting by &quot;White Plains&quot; after the Battle off Samar came just after the amphibious landings on Okinawa in April 1945, when she steamed to within 100 miles of the island to launch two squadrons of Marine Corps F4U Corsair fighter planes for duty from air bases on that large island.

===Post-War===
The end of hostilities in mid-August found the USS &quot;White Plains&quot; en route from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on 22 August but soon moved to San Diego. From there, she headed back to the Western Pacific on 6 September to begin Operation Magic Carpet duty bringing American fighting men home from the Pacific Theater. Twenty days later, she arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she embarked more than 800 passengers for the voyage to the United States. On 28 September, she pointed her bow eastward and set a course, via Pearl Harbor, for San Diego. The &quot;White Plains&quot; entered San Diego Harbor on 16 October and disembarked her passengers. After nine days in port, she got underway for Pearl Harbor and stopped there only briefly on 1 November before setting out on the return voyage to the West Coast. The warship visited San Francisco for five days from 7 to 12 November and then headed across the Pacific once more. She entered port at Guam in the Marianas on 27 November, embarked passengers, and then began the return voyage on 30 November. &quot;White Plains&quot; arrived in Seattle, Washington, on 14 December 1945. She remained there until 30 January 1946, when she embarked upon the voyage, via the Panama Canal and Norfolk, Virginia, to Boston, Massachusetts. The &quot;White Plains&quot; entered Boston Harbor on 17 February 1946, and then began preparations for decommissioning.

The USS &quot;White Plains&quot; was decommissioned on 10 July 1946 and was berthed with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Boston. She remained with the reserve fleet for 12 years. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated a utility aircraft carrier (CVU-66). Finally, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1958. She was sold on 29 July to the Hyman Michaels Company, of Chicago for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;White Plains&quot; earned five battle stars during World War II, as well as the Presidential Unit Citation and Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation for her part in the Battle off Samar.

<doc id="553999" wikidata="Q845907" url="?curid=553999" title="USS Guadalcanal (CVE-60)">
<text>USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; (CVE-60) was a of the United States Navy, which served during and after World War II. She was the first ship to carry her name. She was the flagship of Task Group 22.3, a hunter-killer group which captured the German submarine in 1944.

== Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Guadalcanal&quot; was built using a converted United States Maritime Commission freighter hull by Kaiser Shipyards in Vancouver, Washington. Originally &quot;Astrolabe Bay&quot; (AVG-60), she was reclassified ACV-60 on 20 August 1942 and launched as &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; (ACV-60) on 5 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Alvin I. Malstrom. She was reclassified CVE-60 on 15 July 1943; and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 25 September 1943, Captain Daniel V. Gallery in command. After shakedown training in which Capt. Gallery made the first take off and landing aboard his new ship, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; performed pilot qualifications out of San Diego, California, and then departed on 15 November 1943, via the Panama Canal, for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 3 December. There she became flagship of Task Group 22.3 (TG 22.3), and with her escort destroyers set out from Norfolk on 5 January 1944 in search of enemy submarines in the North Atlantic Ocean.

==First &quot;Hunter-killer&quot; cruise==
World War II submarines had to run surfaced most of the time, and could not stay submerged for more than about 72 hours before having to surface to recharge batteries. But by 1944, U-boats dared not surface in daylight, because they would be spotted by patrolling aircraft. Patrols from escort carriers covered even the middle of the Atlantic. Surfacing at night was safer, because night flight operations from escort carriers were considered too dangerous. The best the escort carriers could do was substitute extra fuel tanks for depth charges on a Grumman TBF Avenger, so the plane could take off at sunset, fly around all night, and land at dawn. The U-boats would not know the plane was unarmed, and would not risk staying surfaced.

Gallery decided that &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; would try night operations. When Ultra intelligence revealed a planned U-boat refueling rendezvous 500 miles west of the Azores just before sunset on 16 January 1944, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; stayed clear of the area until launching eight Avengers just before sunset to comb the rendezvous area. The Avengers found two U-boats engaged in refueling with another standing by, and dived out of the clouds to drop depth charges. All three submarines disappeared; but 32 survivors of were floating in a pool of oil. In their excitement to see the effects of their first successful attack, the Avenger pilots stayed aloft so long they returned to the carrier after sunset.

Aircraft recoveries were slow because of bad approaches in the gathering dusk. After four landed successfully, the fifth Avenger landed too far right and put both wheels into the gallery walkway with its tail fouling the flight deck. The flight deck crew was unable to move the Avenger; and the three remaining planes were running out of fuel in total darkness. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; turned on the lights and urged the pilots to try landing on the left side of the flight deck. The nervous pilots came in too high, too fast, and too far to port until one of them desperately cut power, bounced, and landed inverted in the water off the port side. The plane guard destroyer rescued the three crewmen from the unsuccessful landing and the crewmen from the two remaining planes which were instructed to ditch.

No more night flying was attempted, and no more U-boats were discovered during daylight patrols. Gallery kept his flight deck crew busy training with the wrecked Avenger between flight operations. The Avenger was cabled to the ship so it wouldn&#x27;t be lost; and the crew was timed with a stopwatch to see how long it took them to push it over the side. The plane would then be winched back aboard for another drill. After they could reliably clear the flight deck within four minutes, they were finally allowed to push the battered Avenger overboard with no cable attached. After replenishing at Casablanca, the Task Group headed back to Norfolk and repairs, arriving on 16 February.

==Second &quot;Hunter-killer&quot; cruise==
Departing again with her escorts on 7 March, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; sailed with newly assigned air group VC-58 to Casablanca and got underway from that port on 30 March with a convoy bound for the United States. After three weeks of daylight flights finding no U-boats, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; attempted night flight operations under the full moon of 8 April 1944. Four fully armed Avengers were launched just before sunset with recovery scheduled for 22:30. One of the Avengers found recharging batteries on the surface northwest of Madeira, and forced the U-boat to submerge by dropping a stick of depth charges with &quot;U-515&quot; silhouetted in a down-moon approach. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; kept four Avengers aloft at all times through the night, and when &quot;U-515&quot; attempted to surface to recharge batteries, she was repeatedly forced to submerge. Each sighting gave another fix on &quot;U-515&quot;″s position; and , , , and detected the U-boat with sonar at 07:00. The ships made coordinated attacks until &quot;U-515&quot; was forced to the surface with depleted batteries and foul air at 14:00, and &quot;Kapitaenleutenant&quot; Werner Henke scuttled his ship.

&quot;Guadalcanal&quot; Avengers had detected a second U-boat about sixty miles away while holding down &quot;U-515&quot;; so they maintained patrols through the night of 9 April. was discovered at daybreak on 10 April recharging batteries on the surface 300 miles south of the Azores. Three Avengers attacked out of the dark western sky with depth charges and rocket fire. &quot;U-68&quot; sank, leaving three lookouts swimming in the wreckage, but only Hans Kastrup survived to be rescued when destroyers arrived an hour later.

With the confidence gained through sinking two U-boats in the first two nights of flight operations, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; continued night flight operations as the moon waned, and aircrew were well trained when the task group arrived safely at Norfolk on 26 April 1944. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;″s success encouraged other carriers to practice night operations.

===Capture of &quot;U-505&quot;===

After voyage repairs at Norfolk, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; and her escorts departed Hampton Roads for sea again on 15 May 1944. Two weeks of cruising brought no contacts, and Gallery decided to head the Task Group for the coast of Africa to refuel. However, on 4 June 1944, ten minutes after reversing course 150 miles West of Cape Blanco in French West Africa, &quot;Chatelain&quot; detected as it was returning to its base after an 80-day patrol in the Gulf of Guinea. The destroyer loosed one depth charge attack; then made a second, more accurate drop, guided in by circling aircraft from &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;. This pattern blew relief valves all over the U-boat, cracked pipes in her engine room, and rolled her on her beam ends. Shouts of panic from the engine room led &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Harald Lange, making his first patrol as her captain, to believe his boat was mortally wounded. To save his crew, he blew his tanks and surfaced, coming up barely 700 yards from &quot;Chatelain&quot;. The destroyer fired a torpedo, which missed, and the surfaced submarine then came under the combined fire of the escorts and aircraft as her crew abandoned ship.

Captain Gallery had been waiting and planning for such an opportunity, and had trained and equipped boarding parties. He ordered &quot;Pillsbury&quot; to send a boat with a boarding party to the U-boat. Under the command of Lieutenant, junior grade Albert David, the party leaped onto the slowly circling submarine and found her abandoned. Lt. David and his men quickly seized all important papers, code books, and the boat&#x27;s Enigma machine while closing valves and stopping leaks. As &quot;Pillsbury&quot; attempted to get a tow-line on her the party managed to stop her engines. A larger salvage party from &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; arrived, led by Commander Earl Trosino, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;″s Chief Engineer, and prepared &quot;U-505&quot; for towing. After securing the tow-line and picking up the German survivors from the sea, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; started for Bermuda with her priceless prize in tow. The fleet tug USS &quot;Abnaki&quot; rendezvoused with the task group and took over towing duties. The group arrived in Bermuda on 19 June after a 2,500-mile tow. Trosino, a chief engineer in the civilian Merchant Marine before the war, had figured out the U-boat&#x27;s engines, and wanted to bring her into port under her own power. Gallery refused permission; he later apologized to Trosino for doubting his skill.

&quot;U-505&quot; was the first enemy warship captured on the high seas by the U.S. Navy since 1815. For their daring and skillful teamwork in this remarkable capture, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; and her escorts shared in a Presidential Unit Citation. Lieutenant David received the Medal of Honor for leading the boarding party, and Captain Gallery received the Legion of Merit for conceiving the operation that led to &quot;U-505&quot;″s capture. The captured submarine proved to be of inestimable value to American intelligence. For the remainder of the war she was operated by the U.S. Navy as the USS &quot;Nemo&quot; to learn the secrets of German U-boats. Her true fate was kept secret until the end of the war. &quot;U-505&quot; is now an exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

Arriving in Norfolk on 22 June 1944, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; spent only a short time in port before setting out again on patrol. She departed Norfolk on 15 July and from then until 1 December, she made three anti-submarine cruises in the Western Atlantic. She sailed on 1 December for a training period in waters off Bermuda and Cuba that included refresher landings for pilots of her new squadron, gunnery practice, and anti-submarine warfare drills with the old submarine USS &quot;R-9&quot;. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; arrived at Mayport, Florida on 15 December, and was there employed in carrier qualifications of pilots, She subsequently engaged in further training activities in Cuban waters until 13 February 1945, when she returned to Norfolk. After another short training cruise to the Caribbean Sea, she steamed into Mayport on 15 March for another tour of duty as carrier qualification ship, later moving to Pensacola, Florida for similar operations. After qualifying nearly 4,000 pilots, &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; returned to Norfolk, and decommissioned there on 15 July 1946.

&quot;Guadalcanal&quot; entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk and was redesignated CVU-60 on 15 July 1955, while still in reserve. She was finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 May 1958 and she was sold for scrap to Hugo Neu Corp. of New York on 30 April 1959. She was being towed to Japan for scrapping when now-Rear Admiral Gallery made the very last landing and take-off from the ship, using a helicopter, off Guantanamo, Cuba.

==Awards==
&quot;Guadalcanal&quot; was awarded three battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation for service in World War II. Her Presidential Unit Citation was personally ordered by Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of Naval Operations.

<text>Themisto (), also known as , is a small prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered in 1975, subsequently lost, and rediscovered in 2000.

== Discovery and naming ==
Themisto was first discovered by Charles T. Kowal and Elizabeth Roemer on 30September 1975, reported on 3October 1975, and designated &quot;. However, not enough observations were made to establish an orbit and it was subsequently lost. 

Then, on 21November 2000, a seemingly new satellite was discovered by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Yanga R. Fernández and Eugene A. Magnier and was designated &quot;. It was soon confirmed from computing the past trajectory of the satellite that this was the same as the one observed in 1975. This observation was immediately correlated with an earlier observation on 6August 2000 by the team of Brett J. Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, Hans Scholl, Matthew J. Holman, Brian G. Marsden, Philip D. Nicholson and Joseph A. Burns, which was reported to the Minor Planet Center but not published as an IAU Circular (IAUC).

In October 2002, it was officially named after Themisto, daughter of the river god Inachus and lover of Zeus (Jupiter) in Greek mythology.

== Characteristics ==

Themisto&#x27;s orbit is unusual: unlike most of Jupiter&#x27;s moons, which orbit in distinct groups, Themisto orbits alone. The moon is located midway between the Galilean moons and the first group of prograde irregular moons, the Himalia group.

Themisto is about in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04). While its true albedo could not be measured by NEOWISE due to poor timing of observations, it is known to have color index B−V=0.83, V−R=0.46, and V−I=0.94.

<doc id="554001" wikidata="Q7870820" url="?curid=554001" title="USS Kitkun Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; (CVE-71) was the seventeenth of fifty built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was launched in November 1943, and transferred to the Navy and commissioned in December. She served in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle off Samar, in which she was the first ship to undergo kamikaze attack, and the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, during which she was damaged by another kamikaze and forced to withdraw. Post-war, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She was decommissioned in April 1946, and sold for scrapping in November. Ultimately, she was broken up in early 1947.

==Design and description==
&quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers were designed for a complement of 890, along with 50 to 56 airmen in the attached squadron. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 12 FM-2 fighters, and 8 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 20 aircraft. However, during the Philippines campaign and Battle off Samar, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 15 FM-2 fighters, 10 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, along with two reconnaissance planes, an FM-2P and a TBM-3P.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract, Mc Hull 1108, on 18 June 1942. She was laid down on 3 May 1943 under the name &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, under Frank Knox&#x27;s directive naming escort carriers for &quot;sounds, bays, and islands&quot;. Her namesake, Kitkun Bay, is located on the southeastern end of Prince of Wales Island, constituting part of the Alexander Archipelago, at the time within the Territory of Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1108, the seventeenth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was launched on 8 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Francis E. Cruise; transferred to the Navy and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 15 December 1943, with Captain John Perry Whitney in command.

==Service history==
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; spent the rest of December and early January undergoing outfitting at U.S. Naval Ship Yard Tongue Point, Astoria, Oregon. She then underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast, heading to Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. She arrived at San Diego on 22 January 1944, and after spending a week conducting exercises off the Channel Islands, she loaded Marine Torpedo Bomber Squadron (VMTB) 242 on a transport mission bound for the New Hebrides.

&quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; arrived at Espiritu Santo on 14 February, where she took on a load of cargo, ferrying it to Efate, arriving on 18 February. On her return trip, she stopped at Pearl Harbor on 28 February, arriving back at part in San Diego on 6 March. From 9 to 17 March, she conducted pilot qualifications with her intended air contingent, Composite Squadron (VC) 5 until she returned to port, during which VC-5 was detached for further training. For the rest of March, she performed pilot qualifications for a variety of different squadrons. During April, she was moored at Naval Base San Diego, where maintenance and repairs were conducted. During this period, Rear Admiral Harold Bushnell Salada, commander of Carrier Division 26, designated &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; as his flagship. On 1 May, she left port with VC-5 attached. Joined by her sisters and , she arrived at Ford Island on 8 May, where the carriers conducted training in conjunction with other warships throughout the rest of May.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===

On 31 May, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; sallied forth as part of an armada escorting Transport Division 16 towards Saipan of the Mariana Islands for the planned landings there. &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, along with the other carriers, launched fighter and antisubmarine patrols. On 8 June, she arrived at Kwajalein Atoll. There, she was assigned to serve as the flagship of Task Unit 52.11.1. On 13 June, her fighters notched their first kill, shooting down a Mitsubishi G4M1 variant bomber at 11:05. She arrived off Saipan on 14 June, and her aircraft contingent commenced close air support on the following day.

On the afternoon of 18 June, a large formation of Japanese aircraft, estimated at thirty to fifty planes, was detected approaching from the south. At 17:55, six planes broke through the air screen, and approached the escort carriers. One of these planes, identified as a Nakajima J1N, made a run on &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; from her starboard bow. The aircraft was engaged by anti-aircraft fire, but still managed to release its torpedo within of the carrier. However, due to her hard turn, the torpedo missed &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; by about . As the plane attempted to pull out, it was further damaged, before nose-diving into the ocean. A second plane also tried to engage the carrier, but it was quickly shot down, splashing down about off her port quarter. The next day, on 19 June, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;″s aircraft participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, providing a screen and intercepting Japanese planes.

From 5 to 10 July, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; replenished at Eniwetok of the Marshall Islands. On 23 July, the escort carriers turned their attention towards Tinian, with &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; sending sixteen FM-2 Wildcats and eleven TBM-1C Avengers to strike targets around the island. On 1 August, the escort carriers transitioned towards supporting the landings on Guam. As the marines secured the island, the escort carriers retired for Eniwetok, arriving on 7 August. On 8 August, Rear Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie took over command of Carrier Division 26, and broke his flag on &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;. On 8 September, she escorted the landing craft participating in the landings on Peleliu and Angaur of the Palau Islands, providing close air support as they landed on 15 September. On 21 September, the escort carriers withdrew to Ulithi of the Caroline Islands. They then proceeded to Seeadler Harbor on Manus Island of the Admiralty Islands, where they prepared for the planned Philippines campaign. &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; left Seeadler Harbor on 12 October as part of an advance contingent, escorting Rear Admiral William Fechteler&#x27;s Task Group 28.2. She arrived off of Mindanao on 19 October, and commenced operations in support of the landings on Leyte starting on 20 October.

===Philippines campaign===
====Battle off Samar====

At the time of the invasion, Taffy 3, under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, consisted of , , , , &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, and &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, along with an accompanying screen of three destroyers and four destroyer escorts. Rear Admiral Ofstie had responsibility over &quot;Kiktun Bay&quot; and &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, but Sprague had authority over the unit as a whole. As the U.S. fleet gathered off the Philippines, the Japanese garrison on Suluan managed to alert their command. This prompted Admiral Soemu Toyoda to launch Shō-Gō 1, a gambit to defend Japan&#x27;s access to the oil fields of Southeast Asia. On 18 and 19 October, Taffy 3 conducted strikes against Japanese bases located within Cebu, Negros, and Panay, destroying a total of thirty-eight planes, and damaging twenty-eight more. She then steamed off the island of Samar from 20 to 25 October, providing air support for U.S. forces onshore, and dropping leaflets on Japanese positions. In the meantime, Admiral William Halsey Jr. led his Third Fleet northwards, after spotting Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s diversionary Northern Force. Thus, the only ships covering the vulnerable landing crafts of Leyte Gulf were the three escort carrier task groups and their screens. Taffy 3, the northmost task group, would bear the brunt of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force as it swung through the San Bernardino Strait. 

On the early morning of 25 October, Kurita&#x27;s Center Force had already crossed the San Bernardino Strait unmolested, and was entering the open waters of Leyte Gulf. &quot;White Plains&quot;″s radar had possibly spotted the Japanese force maneuvering into position at 3:00, but this information was disregarded by the ship&#x27;s command. Although World War II era surface radar was notoriously faulty, the speed and course of the spotted blip was consistent with the course set by the Center Force.

At 4:30, the escort carriers went to general quarters in preparation for another round of airstrikes and close air support. The first indication of Japanese contact happened shortly after 6:30, when Taffy 3 experienced three almost simultaneous warnings. Firstly, they began receiving unencrypted Japanese chatter. Secondly, they spotted antiaircraft fire, estimated at to the north, where there was known to be no Allied surface presence. In fact, a TBM Avenger from &quot;St. Lo&quot; had stumbled into the midst of the Japanese fleet, and began radioing Rear Admiral Sprague warnings. Thirdly, &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;″s radar operators spotted an unmistakable surface signature of unknown surface ships just away. As such, the opening stages of the Battle off Samar caught Sprague and the escort carriers completely by surprise.
Upon coming to an understanding of the severity of the situation, Sprague ordered Taffy 3 to steam eastward, in hopes of being shielded by a passing rain squall. &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; swung to 70°, into the wind to aid in launching planes. At 6:55, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; went to flight quarters, &quot;on the double&quot;, launching a set of eight FM-2 Wildcats from 6:56 to 7:03. At 7:10, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; sent out six TBM-1C Avengers, each armed with four semi-armor piercing bombs. At 7:11, another FM-2 Wildcat was dispatched. Sprague also radioed for assistance from Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, the commander of Task Group 77.2, which had just defeated the Southern Force in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Unfortunately for Sprague, Oldendorf was at least three hours sail away, Task Group 77.2 was scattered over an immense distance because of the previous night&#x27;s battle, and it was low on both fuel and ammunition. Taffy 3 would have to confront the Center Force by itself.
Although &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; was located towards the west of the formation, it was shielded by &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; and &quot;White Plains&quot;, which bore the brunt of the opening salvoes from the Japanese fleet, which at the time was about away. The Japanese were firing dye-marked shells to gauge their aim, and &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot; and &quot;White Plains&quot; were quickly bracketed between plumes of color, much to the concern of their command on board. The officers would certainly be more concerned if they were able to correspond the color of the dyed water to that of a particular Japanese ship, as the pink dyes corresponded to the Japanese battleship , with its guns, the largest ever manufactured, and the yellow dyes corresponded to the Japanese battleship , with its guns.

As the Japanese fleet approached closer, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; began to jettison some of her armaments at hand, while continuing to frantically emit smoke. At 7:35, Sprague ordered the escort carriers to begin engaging with their 5-inch guns, and by the end of the battle, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; had expended 120 of the 180 rounds available. At 7:59, one of her shells impacted what was possibly a cruiser, starting a fire in the fore. At 8:03, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; launched a further three FM-2 Wildcats, to join the eight launched earlier. To avoid the Japanese cruisers and , the escort carriers set a southwesterly course, which brought &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; and &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; in the crosshairs of the Japanese force. In the meantime, the pilots of &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;″s air contingent, VC-5 had been distinguishing themselves in their fight against the Japanese fleet. At 8:44, Richard L. Fowler, VC-5&#x27;s commander, led a group of eight FM-2 Wildcats and sixteen TBM Avengers, and under his command, at 8:53, an Avenger from &quot;Manila Bay&quot; succeeded in landing a torpedo hit on &quot;Chikuma&quot;, disabling her handling, and bringing her out of the battle.

After &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; had been thoroughly damaged by shells, setting the ship ablaze, the Japanese turned their attention towards &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, as she peeked out of the smoke. The Japanese gunnery gradually adjusted their aim, and starting from their first salvo at 8:28, crept up to within . Despite the desperate use of smoke screens, and the heroic defense of her escorts, by 8:55, the Japanese had already closed the distance to only . At 8:59, the cruiser , which already had her stern blown off by a torpedo from the destroyer escort , suffered a secondary explosion, possibly derived from the cooking off of munitions on board, crippling her handling and forcing her out of the vanguard formation. At 9:05, Fowler guided two Avengers towards &quot;Chōkai&quot;, where they released their payloads, with Fowler reporting nine bomb hits, five amidships, three near the bow, and one near the stern, fatally damaging the heavy cruiser. At 9:40, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was scuttled by torpedoes from the destroyer . Undaunted, &quot;Tone&quot; had closed the distance to within of &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, with its salvo straddling the fleeing carrier on both sides. As a parting shot, a volley passed &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;″s side by only . However, at this point, Admiral Kurita, discouraged by the resistance he was facing, and uncertain about the intelligence provided to him, convinced himself to withdraw. At 9:25, to the bewilderment of Rear Admiral Sprague, the Japanese fleet turned around and retired. Remarkably, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, despite several near-misses, suffered no significant damage during the engagement, and only a few casualties from flying fragments.

&quot;Taffy 3&quot; continued harassing the Japanese as they withdrew from the Battle off Samar. At 10:15, six TBM-1C Avengers were launched from &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, five of them outfitted with torpedoes, joining four more TBM Avengers to attack the retreating Japanese fleet. Proceeding north, one of the TBM Avengers was forced to break off due to mechanical issues. The remaining strike force sighted &quot;Chikuma&quot;, and in the ensuing action, scored two torpedo hits on the &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s portside, severely damaging it. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was finished off by aircraft from and .
At 10:51, five kamikaze Zeroes were spotted approaching &quot;Taffy 3&quot; from the northwest. These planes were part of Yukio Seki&#x27;s &quot;Shikishima&quot; squadron, which were conducting the first official kamikaze attacks of the war. The carriers and their escorts were caught out of position, and by the time concentrated anti-aircraft fire could be brought to bear, the kamikazes were nearly on-top of the formation. The first kamikaze to strike set its sights on &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, diving from her port side. As it approached the carrier, the kamikaze changed the angle of its dive, aiming directly for &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;″s island, but at the last second, perhaps due to the incapacitation of the pilot, it streaked just over the island. It careened into the port walkway netting, tore through the port catwalk, bringing of it along, which detonating its bomb on board, before plunging into the ocean some from her port side. The bomb showered fragments throughout the flight deck, puncturing more than 100 holes, and breached the gasoline lines, forming a puddle within a gun sponson, which was washed overboard. One crewman onboard was killed, four were seriously wounded, twelve were slightly wounded, and two TBM-1C Avengers were rendered inoperational from the attack. This gave &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; the uneasy distinction of being the first ship to undergo kamikaze attack in the course of the Pacific War. Many of her fellow ships would follow, including her sisters in &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, who were not so lucky, with &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; being badly injured and &quot;St. Lo&quot; suffering fatal damage.

At 11:10, a group of fifteen Yokosuka D4Ys was detected approaching by &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;. At 11:23, one of the bombers made a run on the carrier, but both of its wings were torn off by anti-aircraft fire, and it plunged into the ocean off her port bow, detonating upon impact and showering the flight deck with seawater. On 26 October, &quot;Taffy 3&quot; was instructed to retire to Manus for replenishment and repairs, arriving there on 1 November. There, Captain Albert Handly took over command of the vessel. Transiting eastwards, VC-5&#x27;s planes were detached to Ford Island on the morning of 18 November, and the squadron&#x27;s pilots were unloaded at Pearl Harbor later that day. She was put into dry dock for repairs, being discharged on 29 November, when she took on Composite Squadron (VC) 91 as her air squadron. Entering Manus on 17 December, Ofstie put on &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; again as his flagship. At Manus, preparations were made for the planned landings on Luzon. &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; was assigned as the flagship of Task Unit 77.4.3, the Lingayen Protective Group, along with her sister .

====Invasion of Lingayen Gulf====

On 31 December, the American fleet set out from Seeadler Harbor. En route, until 8 January 1945, when the American fleet arrived within Lingayen Gulf, the task unit&#x27;s aircraft contingent provided an air screen for the Task Force 79, under the command of Vice Admiral Theodore Stark Wilkinson, which included landing craft, as it transited towards the invasion site. During the latter half the transit, the American fleet was bedeviled by kamikazes, which sunk &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; and damaged both and .

On the evening of 8 January, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; was still screening Task Force 79, when at 18:06, a group of Japanese aircraft was detected approaching some from the southwest. The fighters of &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; and &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;, which had been conducting air patrols at the time, were diverted to intercept the planes. However, two of the kamikazes evaded the screen, and at 18:55, soon after the sun had set, one of the kamikazes, a Japanese Oscar, started its dive upon &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;. Undeterred by intense flak, it leveled off slightly at around , before smashing into her portside at 18:57, carving a by hole in her hull, part of which extended below the waterline. Fortunately for &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;, the kamikaze&#x27;s two 550 pound bombs did not arm and detonate, although the explosion of its fuel tank killed four men and ignited a fire. In addition, leading up to impact, a 5-inch/38 caliber anti-aircraft round fired, in an attempt to bring down the kamikaze, from one of her friendly escorting ships (likely an adjacent cruiser to starboard of the ship), burst near her bow under a gun sponson, killing and wounding several, with the blast sending a crewman into the water, where he had to be rescued by the ship&#x27;s escorting destroyers. Altogether, the attack killed sixteen and wounded thirty-seven.

&quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; quickly acquired a list of 13° to port, and she was down by her stern. Furthermore, water enveloped the engineering compartments, forcing the crew inside to evacuate, and smoke filtered throughout the belowdecks. Spurred by this serious situation, the entirety of the crew was ordered onto the flight deck, where the aircraft at hand were repositioned towards the starboard side in an attempt to correct the list. All non-essential crew were transferred off the ship onto her screens, and Rear Admiral Ofstie ordered all confidential documents on board to be destroyed, before transferring himself and his complement to the destroyer , which ferried him to &quot;Shamrock Bay&quot;.

The flames were extinguished by 19:10, and by 19:47, the was on standby to take &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; under tow when it was safe. Pumping checked her list down to 4°, and repair parties entering the engine room were able to restore partial power. At 20:42, &quot;Chowanac&quot; secured a line to her, where they proceeded towards Santiago island. On the morning of 9 January, she was able to make steam under her own power, and all personnel sans the wounded returned later that day. Limited flight operations were even resumed, although she was ordered to retire on 11 January as part of a convoy. Making stops for limited repairs at Leyte Gulf, where she transferred her aircraft off, Manus, and Pearl Harbor, she returned to the United States by late February.

Moored at Terminal Island for repairs and refitting, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; would not set sail again until 27 April, when she underwent a transport mission to Pearl Harbor, where it was discovered that additional repairs were required. After conducting some exercises with her new aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron (VC) 63, she departed on the morning of 15 June for Ulithi, stopping at Guam. There, she reported to Task Force 30.8, the Third Fleet, forming Task Unit 30.8.23 along with her sister . The two carriers provided screening and antisubmarine patrols for the fast carriers, which launched strikes all along the Japanese islands, and conducted replenishment missions in support of the rest of the fleet. Notably, at this point, the Japanese were conserving their forces for the expected invasion of Japan, and &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; encountered little serious opposition in her patrols. Nonetheless, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; suffered men lost during this period. On 4 August, a forge within the shipfitter&#x27;s shop exploded, burning several men, killing one, and forcing two others overboard to escape the flames, who were later rescued by the destroyer escort . On 11 August, Captain John Francis Greenslade took over command of the ship at Eniwetok. At Eniwetok, on 15 August, the crew of &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; received word of the Japanese surrender.

===Post-war===
&quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; formed Task Unit 49.5.2, turning out on 16 August for Adak Island. There, she joined a bevy of other warships headed towards Mutsu Bay, where Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher accepted the surrender for Japanese forces in northern Honshu and in Hokkaido. Then, she steamed southwards into Tokyo Bay. There, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. In her maiden Magic Carpet voyage, she picked up 554 servicemen in Japan, including ex-POWs, and ferried them to San Francisco. She conducted additional trips to Pearl Harbor and Okinawa, entering San Pedro on 12 January 1946. She then proceeded up the West Coast, entering Puget Sound on 18 February.

There, &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; was decommissioned on 19 April, and struck from the Navy list on 8 May. She was sold on 18 November to Zidell Ship Dismantling Company of Portland for $12,700. She was transferred in January 1947, and scrapped sometime in early 1947. &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service, and along with the rest of Taffy 3, received the Presidential Unit Citation for conduct during the Battle off Samar.

<doc id="554003" wikidata="Q7870650" url="?curid=554003" title="USS Kadashan Bay">
<text>USS &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; (CVE-76) was a of the United States Navy. It was named after Kadashan Bay, located within Chichagof Island. The bay in turn was named after Paul K. Kadashan, an Alaskan Indian who established a homestead incorporating the bay in 1915. Launched in December 1943, and commissioned in January 1944, she served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle off Samar, and the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in February 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters, and 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 27 aircraft. However, during the Battle off Samar, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers for a total of 33 aircraft. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 22 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, and a TBM-1CP reconnaissance plane.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 2 September 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1113, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 11 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Audrey Ackerman; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 18 January 1944, with Captain Robert Nisbet Hunter in command.

==Service history==
Upon being commissioned, &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise off of San Diego. On 6 March, she departed San Diego on a cruise to Espiritu Santo. She made two runs, transporting 154 aircraft, before returning to San Diego on 13 May. Following a brief period of repairs and training, the escort carrier sailed on 10 July to join a Task Group 32.7 at Pearl Harbor. This task group was formed in preparation for the imminent Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. As a part of Carrier Division 27, under the command of Rear Admiral William Sample, she sailed alongside , , and , which served as the flagship. In August, she sailed for Tulagi, where final preparations were made for the imminent invasion.

Her task group departed Tulagi on 6 September, arriving off of Peleliu on 11 September. There, the escort carriers launched airstrikes to destroy defenses and to prepare the way for landings, although the impact by these bombings proved to be insufficient. The marines landed on 15 September, seizing the air field, and finding themselves in a battle of attrition against a determined Japanese garrison. &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; stayed offshore the island, providing close air support until the beginning of October, when she retired to Manus to restock on supplies. After a short period of rest, she steamed towards Leyte Gulf on 14 October, providing cover for Task Group 78.6, a reinforcement group which would stay offshore of Leyte.

Upon arriving on 21 October and joining Taffy 2, she began conducting airstrikes in support of troops which had already landed. On 25 October, one of her fighters, piloted by Ensign Hans L. Jensen, on a routine patrol mission, sighted the Central Force of the Japanese fleet off of Samar. After reporting his sighting, he launched an unsupported attack against the leading cruiser, beginning the decisive Battle off Samar. Once learning of the size and the importance of the Japanese fleet, she launched three fighter and three torpedo strikes against the Japanese force, which was threatening Taffy 3. The large number of American planes was a contributing force in convincing Vice admiral Takeo Kurita to retire, and to not take advantage of his position. On 30 October, she retired for Manus, where she arrived on 3 November.

In late November, the escort carriers began departing Manus and congregating at Kossol Roads, and on 10 December, she sortied for Mindoro. From 12 to 13 December, she transited the Surigao Strait, and as she moved west, her task group came under heavy aerial attack. In these actions, her fighters accounted for eleven planes, with running battles continuing to the end of December. By now, preparations were underway for the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. As part of Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey&#x27;s San Fabian task group, she provided air cover for the ships as they proceeded behind the main force. Eventually, she rendezvoused with the main force covering the landings on 3 January 1945.
&quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; arrived off of Luzon on 8 January, where she prepared to commence operations. At 7:00 that morning, she, along with &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, launched two squadrons of fighters. At 7:16, radar detected a large contingent of Japanese aircraft, to the east of the task group, which separated into three groups. The fighters moved to intercept, with other escort carriers contributing their own fighters. At 7:46, &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; finished launching her last four fighters, and as they struggled for altitude, a Nakajima Ki-43 kamikaze aircraft dove towards the carrier. Whilst the newly launched fighters were helpless against the first kamikaze, they did manage to shoot down a different kamikaze, a Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter which attempted to follow up on &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot;.
The Nakajima Ki-43 that the fighter crews had spotted were also noticed by the crew of &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot;. The crew observed the plane break away from an engagement several miles east, and head straight towards the carrier. Consequently, the ship&#x27;s crew started a hard left turn in an attempt to stall for time. Although the aircraft came under heavy anti-aircraft fire, it continued, aiming directly for the carrier&#x27;s bridge. Perhaps as a result of the concentrated fire, it then plunged down, striking below the bridge at the waterline, tearing a by hole, destroying the junior officers&#x27; quarters. The kamikaze sparked a brief gasoline fire, which was quickly put under control. A more pressing concern was flooding, which was accentuated by the ship&#x27;s turn. Her gasoline system was inoperative, and her bow sank below design specifications. Remarkably, no-one was killed, and only three crewmen were wounded by the kamikaze. Nonetheless, the damage forced &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; to retire from operations. On 10 January, she transferred her aircraft contingent to &quot;Marcus Island&quot;, and she returned to Leyte on 12 January for temporary repairs.

On 13 February, she arrived at San Diego for further repairs, and then reported at San Francisco for complete overhaul. Once overhaul was finished, she sailed for Pearl Harbor on 8 April, where she arrived on 14 April. She would spend the rest of the war ferrying aircraft and men throughout the Pacific. During July the escort carrier was designated as a replenishment carrier for the Third Fleet. She was en route from Pearl Harbor to begin her new duty when the news of Japan&#x27;s surrender was received.

===Post-war===
After the end of the war, &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; joined Operation Magic Carpet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She reported at Guam in September and arrived at San Francisco on 26 September with her first group of veterans. For the next three months, the escort carrier conducted Magic Carpet runs, stopping at Pearl Harbor, Guam, Okinawa, and China. She arrived at San Pedro on 22 December to finish her last Pacific cruise, and departed San Diego on 10 January 1946, bound for Boston. &quot;Kadashan Bay&quot; arrived at Boston on 29 January, was decommissioned on 14 June 1946, and subsequently placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet there. She was reclassified CVU-76 on 12 June 1955. She was redesignated as an aircraft ferry on 7 May 1959, and given the hull symbol AKV-26. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1959 and sold for scrap to Comarket Inc. in February 1960. She was broken up in Hong Kong, starting June 1960.

<text>Glenn Maitland Turner (born 26 May 1947) played cricket for New Zealand and was one of the country&#x27;s most prolific batsmen. He played domestically for Otago for most of his career and played in England for Worcestershire County Cricket Club 15 seasons.

==Early life==
Glenn Turner was born at Dunedin in 1947 and went to Otago Boys&#x27; High School, where he became serious about playing cricket. He played for the school between 1962 and 1964. He admitted that he spent so much time playing sport that he neglected his studies. He played a trial match for Otago against Southland in Invercargill where he scored 105 not out. This innings helped him get selected for the Otago team to play in the Plunket Shield at the age of 17.

His brothers are poet Brian Turner and golfer Greg Turner. His wife Dame Sukhi Turner, whom he met while touring India in 1969, is a former mayor of Dunedin.

==Domestic career==
Glenn Turner made his first class debut for Otago against Canterbury at Carisbrook in 1964. He scored 126 runs that season averaging 14 per innings. He was a very slow scorer of runs at that stage. In one innings he scored 21 runs in 235 minutes. His second season of first class cricket in 1965–66, he finished second in the averages with 330 runs at an average of 47.14. In his third season of first class cricket for Otago in 1966–67, he scored 224 runs at an average of 22.4 per innings. Turner had trials with Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Lancashire, Middlesex, and Surrey and gained a contract with Worcestershire. He played two games for Worcestershire in 1967 and in the following season (1968) he played 25 first class games for them scoring 1182 runs at 28.82 with one century (106 against Middlesex). He had a quieter 1969 season scoring only 502 runs and failing to score a century.

In 1970, Glenn Turner had his best season in first class cricket for Worcestershire. He chose to play more aggressively and scored 2379 runs which included 10 centuries and 9 fifties at an average of 61 runs. He was described by Tom Graveney that season as &quot;He suddenly found the confidence to play his shots&quot;. Wisden named him as one of their Players of the Year. His 2379 runs that year also made him the highest run scorer for the English season.

Glenn Turner made his mark on the first-class cricket scene, particularly with Worcestershire in the English county championship. In all, he played 455 first-class matches, amassing 34,346 runs at 49.70, including 103 centuries making him one of a select few to score a &quot;century of centuries&quot;, one of only four non-English cricketers to do so (the others being Donald Bradman, Zaheer Abbas and Viv Richards).

Turner is one of only two players (the other being Graeme Hick in 1988 also for Worcestershire) since the Second World War to have scored 1000 first-class runs in England before the end of May, a feat he achieved in 1973. Among the eight batsmen who have done this, only Turner and Donald Bradman did it while playing for a touring team. Christopher Martin-Jenkins described him as &#x27;unswervingly single-minded in his pursuit of runs&#x27; and &#x27;unashamedly ambitious&#x27;. In 1973, Glenn Turner again was the highest run scorer in the English season, scoring a total of 2416 runs.

Glenn Turner scored the most first class runs in the New Zealand 1975–76 season. He scored a total of 1244 runs at an average of 77.75 in 20 innings. This included scores of 177*, 104, 115 and 121* for Otago and 177 for New Zealand.

He also holds the record of highest percentage of runs scored in any completed innings 83.43% after he scored 141* out of Worcestershire&#x27;s 169 against Glamorgan at Swansea in 1977. The remaining batsmen scored 27, highest 7 and there was one extra.

In 1979, Glenn Turner scored his last century in New Zealand. His 136 for Otago at Molyneux Park in Alexandra included a partnership with Wayne Blair (who scored 82*) to draw with Auckland.

On 29 May 1982, in scoring his 100th first class century, Turner became the first batsman in 33 years to score 300 runs in a single day in England. He was 311 not out when Worcestershire declared at 501–1 against Warwickshire. Glenn Turner also succeeded in averaging 90.07 runs during the 1982 English season.

==International career ==
After scoring 123 for the South Island versus the West Indies, Glenn Turner made his test debut against the West Indies in March 1969 making a duck in the first innings and 40 in the second innings on debut in the first test. He followed this up with 74 in the first innings of the second test.

In the 1972 New Zealand tour of the West Indies, Turner scored four double centuries. The first was 202* against the Presidents&#x27; XI, then 223* in the first test, 259 against Guyana and 259 in the fourth test. The 259 in the fourth test was the second longest innings in test cricket in terms of the 759 balls faced. His performances saw him named the New Zealand Almanack Player-of-the-Year.

In 1974, Turner became the first New Zealander to score a century in each innings in a test match which assisted New Zealand to beat Australia for the first time in a test match.

Glenn Turner is also the first player to score in an ODI a score of over 150 and also holds the record for the only batsman in ODI history to have faced over 200 deliveries in a single innings.

He represented New Zealand in 41 Tests, and achieved an average of 44.64, including seven centuries. He would have appeared for his country much more, however, had he not elected to be unavailable for several seasons after falling out with administrators.

=== Cricket World Cup ===
Glenn Turner played in three world cups. In the 1975 world cup, He scored 171* in New Zealand&#x27;s opening game against East Africa. At that time it was the highest one day international score ever made, passing both David Lloyd&#x27;s 116 for the highest by a male cricketer in ODI and Lynne Thomas&#x27; overall record of 134. With a bowling attack lacking experience against someone like Turner, He found gaps in the field and scored &quot;mostly with magnificent drives&quot;. It was also the longest individual innings in one-day international history, occupying 201 balls. He scored a second century (114*) against India in the third round robin match.

In the 1979 world cup, Glenn Turner topped the averages (88) and runs scored (176) for New Zealand without scoring a century.

In the 1983 world cup, he had a disappointing tournament scoring 103 runs from six innings.

== Cricket coach ==
Glenn Turner was the manager or coach of the New Zealand Cricket team between 1985 and 1987 for the Australian series when he presided over the team&#x27;s first series victory in Australia, the 1986 tour to England, the West Indies tour of New Zealand and the 1987 world cup. He coached at the New Zealand Cricket Academy between 1991 and 1994. In 1995, he was again appointed the New Zealand cricket team coach until 1996 and coached the team in the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

== Author ==
Turner has written five books on his involvement in cricket:
*&quot;My Way&quot; (1975)
*&quot;Glenn Turner&#x27;s Century of Centuries&quot; (with Ray Cairns, 1983)
*&quot;Opening Up&quot; (with Brian Turner, 1987)

<text>USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; (CVE-68) was a of the United States Navy.

She originally designated an AVG, was classified ACV-68 on 20 August 1942; laid down under a United States Maritime Commission contract 26 April 1943 by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Vancouver, Washington; reclassified CVE-68 on 15 July 1943; launched 15 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Anna Mary Updegraff, mother of Captain William N. Updegraff, U.S. Navy; and commissioned 27 November at Astoria, Oregon, Captain C. R. Brown in command.

USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; was named after a bay on the northern shore of Kruzof Island in the Alexander Archipelago of southeastern Alaska.

==Service history==
After shakedown along the Pacific Coast, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; departed San Diego 3 January 1944 for replenishment duty in the Pacific. Laden with troops and a cargo of planes, she steamed via Pearl Harbor for the Gilbert Islands, arriving off Tarawa Atoll 24 January to supply 5th Fleet carriers then engaged in the conquest of the Marshalls. For more than two weeks she provided logistic support from Tarawa to Majuro Atoll before returning to Alameda, California, 24 February.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign===
With Composite Squadron 3 (VC-3) embarked 9 April, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; reached Majuro, Marshalls, 23 April; conducted ASW air patrols off Mili Atoll; and proceeded to Pearl Harbor 1 May to prepare for the Marianas operation. She departed Pearl Harbor 30 May; and, while en route to Saipan, she successfully evaded a Japanese torpedo that crossed her bow close aboard. Touching at Eniwetok 9 June, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; reached the eastern coast of Saipan 15 June and commenced air operations in support of the invasion. After repelling an enemy air attack at dusk on the 17th, she sailed 19 June to ferry planes to and from Eniwetok. Returning to Saipan 24 June, she resumed effective air strikes against enemy positions on the embattled island until 9 July when she steamed via Eniwetok for similar duty at Guam. Arriving 20 July, she launched direct support and ASW sorties until 2 August, then returned to Eniwetok to prepare for operations in the Palau Islands.

===Mariana and Palau Islands Campaign===
&quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; cleared Eniwetok 18 August and proceeded via Tulagi, Florida Island, to the Southern Palaus where she arrived 14 September with units of the 3rd Fleet. Ordered to furnish air support for the capture, occupation, and defense of Peleliu, Angaur, and Ngesebus, she launched air strikes to support landing operations. For 2 weeks her planes, flying almost 400 sorties, inflicted heavy damage on enemy ground installations and shipping. On 25 September, alone, they sank or destroyed three cargo transports and six landing barges.

===Philippines Campaign===
She departed the Palaus 30 September; and, upon arriving Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, 3 October, she received a new commanding officer, Captain T. B. Williamson. &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; departed Manus 12 October en route to the Philippine Islands. Ordered to provide air coverage and close air support during the bombardment and amphibious landings on Leyte Island, she arrived off Leyte 17 October. After furnishing air support during landings by Ranger units on Dinagat and Homonhon Islands in the eastern approaches to Leyte Gulf, she launched air strikes in support of invasion operations at Tacloban on the northeast coast of Leyte. Operating with Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s &quot;Taffy 3&quot; (Task Unit 77.4.3), which consisted of 6 escort carriers and a screen of 3 destroyers and 4 destroyer escorts, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; sailed to the east of Leyte and Samar as her planes, flying 244 sorties from 18 to 24 October, struck and destroyed enemy installations and airfields on Leyte, Samar, Cebu, Negros, and Panay Islands.

=== The Battle off Samar ===
Steaming about 60 miles east of Samar before dawn 25 October, Taffy 3 prepared to launch the day&#x27;s initial air strikes. At 0647, Rear Admiral Sprague received word that a sizable Japanese fleet was approaching from the northwest. Comprising four battleships, eight cruisers, and eleven destroyers, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force steadily closed and at 0658 opened fire on Taffy 3.

So began the Battle off Samar—one of the most memorable engagements in U.S. naval history. Outnumbered and outgunned, the slower Taffy 3 seemed fated for disaster; but the American ships defied the odds and gamely accepted the enemy&#x27;s challenge.

&quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; accelerated to flank speed, and, despite fire from three enemy cruisers, she launched her planes, ordering the pilots &quot;to attack the Japanese task force and proceed to Tacloban airstrip, Leyte, to rearm and regas.&quot; As salvos fell &quot;with disconcerting rapidity&quot; increasingly nearer &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;, her planes, striking the enemy force with bombs, rockets, and gunfire, inflicted heavy damage on the closing ships.

==== Coming under heavy fire ====
As the trailing ship in the escort caravan, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; came under intense enemy fire. Though partially protected by chemical smoke, by a timely rain squall, and by valiant counterattacks of screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, she took the first of 15 direct hits at 0750. Fired from the Japanese battleship Haruna, a 14-inch (356 mm) shell struck the starboard side of the hangar deck just abaft the forward elevator.

By 0800, the Japanese heavy cruiser Haguro, the only &quot;Nachi class cruiser&quot; present in the engagement, was spotted steaming off &quot;Kalinin Bay&#x27;s&quot; port quarter, closed to within 18,000 yards. &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; gamely responded to their straddling salvos with rapid fire from her single 5 inch gun, which only intensified the enemy fire. Three 8-inch armor-piercing projectiles from &quot;Haguro&quot; struck her within minutes of each other. At 0825, the carrier&#x27;s 5-incher scored a direct hit from 16,000 yards on &quot;Haguro&quot; No. 2 turret and a second hit shortly thereafter forced the enemy ship to withdraw temporarily from formation.

At 0830, five enemy destroyers steamed over the horizon off her starboard quarter. The closing ships opened fire from about 14,500 yards, and, as screening ships engaged the cruisers and laid down concealing smoke, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; shifted her fire, and, for the next hour, traded shots with Japan&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 10. Many salvos exploded close aboard or passed directly overhead, and, though no destroyer fire hit &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; directly, she took ten more 8-inch (203 mm) hits from the now-obscured &quot;Haguro&quot;. One shell passed through the flight deck and into the communications area, where it destroyed all the radar and radio equipment.

Under heavy attack from the air and harassed by incessant fire from American destroyers and destroyer escorts, the enemy cruisers broke off action and turned northward at 0920. At 0915, the enemy destroyers, which were kept at bay by the daring and almost single-handed exploits of the destroyer , launched a premature torpedo attack from 10,500 yards. As the torpedoes approached the escort carriers, they slowed down. A Grumman TBF Avenger from strafed and exploded two torpedoes in &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; wake about 100 yards astern, and a shell from the latter&#x27;s 5 inch gun deflected a third from a collision course with her stern.

At about 0930, as the enemy ships fired parting salvos and reversed course northward, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; scored a direct hit amidships on a retreating destroyer. Five minutes later, she ceased fire and retired southward with the surviving ships of Taffy 3. At 1050, the task unit came under a concentrated air attack. During the 40-minute battle, the first attack from a &quot;Kamikaze&quot; unit in World War II, all except were damaged. One plane of Lieutenant Yukio Seki and his Shikishima squadron crashed through &quot;St. Lo&quot; flight deck and exploded her torpedo and bomb magazine, mortally wounding the carrier. Four diving planes attacked &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; from astern and the starboard quarter. Intense fire splashed two close aboard; but a third plane crashed into the port side of the flight deck, damaging it badly. The fourth hit destroyed the aft port stack.

As part of Taffy 3, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; had prevented a Japanese penetration into Leyte Gulf and saved General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s beachhead in the Philippines. At a cost of five ships and 1,161 men, Taffy 3, aided by her own planes and those of &quot;Taffy 2&quot; (Task Unit 77.4.2), sank three enemy cruisers, seriously damaged several other ships, and turned back the &quot;most powerful surface fleet which Japan had sent to sea since the Battle of Midway.&quot;

Despite the battle damage, Taffy 3 cleared the air of attacking planes; at noon, the escort carriers retired southeastward while their escort searched for survivors from &quot;St. Lo&quot;. Though &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; suffered extensive structural damage during the morning&#x27;s furious action, she counted only 5 dead among her 60 casualties. Weary and battle scarred, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for heroic conduct as a unit of Taffy 3. She steamed via Woendi, Schouten Islands, to Manus, arriving 1 November for emergency repairs. Getting under way for the United States 7 November, the escort carrier reached San Diego 27 November for permanent repairs and alterations.

==End of career==
Repairs completed 18 January 1945, the veteran escort carrier departed San Diego 20 January to ferry planes and men to Pearl Harbor and Guam. For more than 8 months, she served as a replenishment carrier in the Pacific Carrier Transport Squadron; and, during six cruises between the West Coast and Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, she transported more than 600 planes. Departing San Diego 2 September, she steamed to the Philippines, arriving at Samar 28 September to participate in Operation Magic Carpet. With 1,048 men embarked, she departed Samar 1 October and arrived San Francisco 19 October.

After conducting two more voyages between California and Pearl Harbor, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; departed San Diego 8 December for the Far East. On 25 December, while she steamed to Yokosuka, Japan, an intense storm heavily damaged her flight deck. Arriving the 27th, she received emergency repairs, then sailed 3 January 1946 for the West Coast and arrived San Diego 17 January. On 13 February, she proceeded to the eastern seaboard, reaching Boston 9 March. &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; was decommissioned 15 May, and she was sold for scrap 8 December to Patapsco Steel Co., Baltimore, Maryland.

==Awards==
In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; (CVE-69) was the fifteenth of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Kasaan Bay, a name assigned to the bay by the local Haida Indians. The bay is located within Prince of Wales Island, which at the time was a part of the Territory of Alaska. The ship was launched in October 1943, commissioned in December, and served as a transport carrier in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, as well as taking part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of occupied Southern France. Her aircraft provided air support and strategic bombing capabilities, disrupting German supply lines, and earning &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; a battle star. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. Ultimately, she was broken up in March 1960.

==Design and description==

&quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carrier ever built, and was designed specifically to be rapidly mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. By the end of their production run, the time taken between laying down the hull and launching the ship had been cut down to nearly one month. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard and with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size limited the length of the flight deck and necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to 16, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During Operation Dragoon, she carried 24 F6F-5 Hellcat fighters, 3 TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, and 8 F6F-3N Hellcat variant night fighters for a total of 35 aircraft, a rare occurrence, as Hellcats typically tended to operate on fleet carriers, rather than escort carriers.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a United States Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 11 May 1943 under the name &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. Her namesake, Kasaan Bay, was in turn derived from the local Kaigani Haida, who named the bay after the nearby settlement of Gasa&#x27;áan, the name of which had originated from the Tlingit name Kasa&#x27;aan, meaning &quot;pretty town&quot;. She was laid down as MC hull 1106, the fifteenth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-69, indicating that she was the sixty-ninth escort carrier to be commissioned into the United States Navy. She was launched on 24 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Morse, the wife of Captain Morse, who would later become best known as the advising Aviation Officer for the Fifth Fleet; transferred to the Navy and commissioned on 4 December 1943, with Captain Bradford Ellsworth Grow in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. Upon finishing, she was assigned to transport duty, and sailed from San Francisco on 8 January 1944 with a load of aircraft and passengers, bound for Pearl Harbor. After returning to Naval Air Station San Diego, she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 28 February for overhaul and operations along the East Coast. On 28 May, she left New York City in conjunction with her sisters and , ferrying aircraft on a round trip to Casablanca, French Morocco. She arrived at Casablanca on 6 June, departed on 8 June, and returned to New York on 17 June, carrying onboard 342 survivors of the , which had been torpedoed by a German U-boat on 29 May.

Upon returning to the East Coast, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; and &quot;Tulagi&quot; were informed that they were to take part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied landings in Southern France. She first took on her fighting aircraft contingent Fighter Squadron (VF) 74, commanded by Lieutenant Commander H. Brinkley Bass, before heading to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, arriving on 29 June, where Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin and his staff turned &quot;Tulagi&quot; into his flagship. The next day, on 30 June, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; and &quot;Tulagi&quot; left port, accompanied by six destroyer escorts as a part of Task Group 27.7, heading for Oran, French Algeria. En route, the two carriers conducted extensive exercises, as both the carriers&#x27; crews and their aircraft contingents were relatively inexperienced.

Arriving at Oran on 10 July, Task Group 27.7 dissolved, with Durgin heading for Naples, Allied occupied Italy for invasion planning. In the meantime, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; participated in training and spotting exercises off of the Algerian coast. On 17 July, the force, now reconstituted as Task Group 80.2, which now had a wholly new complement of escorting destroyers, left Oran for Malta. During the passage, the screening picked up a suspicious contact on sonar and dropped depth charges. As one of &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot;″s Avengers was up on anti-submarine patrol at the time, it headed for &quot;Niblack&quot;″s course and assisted in dropping more depth charges, albeit their combined efforts resulted in no apparent results.
The task group, stopping at Malta on 26 July, took Durgin back on board, and had the British &quot;Bogue&quot;-class escort carriers and join the force. Both of the British ships had 24 Supermarine Seafire fighters on board, and would assist in providing a fighter screen throughout the operation. Later that same day, the task group departed for Alexandria, Egypt, for additional training operations. Arriving at Alexandria, the task group was assigned to operate under the command of Rear admiral Thomas Hope Troubridge, as a part of Task Force 88. Thus, her task group&#x27;s code was changed to Task Group 88.2. Altogether, Task Force 88 would consist of nine carriers, two British light cruisers, six U.S. destroyers, and six British minelayers. After conducting exercises, the Task Group returned to Malta on 3 August, and then proceeded onwards to Salerno on 7 August in order to take part in a dress rehearsal of the invasion. During the transit, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot;″s Avengers and Hellcat night fighters were detached and sent to Corsica. On 10 August, the Task Force was back in Malta.

On 12 August, the Task Force sortied from Malta, this time to support the invasion. In order to deceive enemy observations regarding the force&#x27;s intentions, the Task Force first headed due west, and upon reaching the longitude of Provence on the night on 13 August, turned due north. On the morning of 15 August, D-Day, the Allied surface forces opened fire on the German coastal defenses. For the next six days, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; and &quot;Tulagi&quot; provided close air support for the Seventh Army as it established its beachheads and pushed inland. There was generally very little resistance from the Germans in the air, with the Luftwaffe having been stretched thinly across multiple fronts, but the anti-aircraft fire was heavy at times. The initial targets for VF-74 were a group of four coastal batteries situated on Porquerolles, whilst the aircraft contingent of &quot;Tulagi&quot;, Observation Fighting Squadron (VOF) 1, directed naval surface fire. On the initial day of the landings, VF-74 tallied up sixty sorties.

On 17 August, VF-74 launched a successful attack on a coastal battery situated on Port-Cros. However, on the last flight of the day, eight of VF-74&#x27;s Hellcats had been launched, with instructions to opportunistically strike targets. Whilst the Hellcats were strafing a German truck convoy under the fading light, two of the Hellcats went missing, albeit whether it was due to German anti-aircraft fire or thunderstorms was never determined. Returning to the carrier, another Hellcat went into the flight deck&#x27;s crash barrier, blocking the deck, and forcing the remaining Hellcats to divert to &quot;Tulagi&quot;. 

On the morning of 19 August, a Junkers Ju 88 bomber was intercepted by eight of &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot;″s Hellcats, led by VF-74&#x27;s skipper, Bass, and shot down. Later that same day, six of &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot;″s Hellcats intercepted and shot down a lone Dornier Do 217 bomber. On the morning of 20 August, the second flight of the day for VF-74, consisting of six Hellcats, involved strafing a train of ammunition wagons. In the course of the action, one of the wagons exploded, bringing down one of the Hellcats, and damaging two others, forcing them to return to ship. Near Villefranche-sur-Mer, one of the three remaining Hellcats was hit and downed by anti-aircraft fire, albeit the pilot escaped back to Allied lines via Bordeaux. On the afternoon of that same day, Bass was leading a group of eight Hellcats up the Rhône valley striking targets of opportunity. Spotting what appeared to be a German motorcycle, Bass dived his plane for an attack, but much too low. His Hellcat&#x27;s belly tank was torn off, destabilizing the aircraft, and sending it into the ground, killing Bass. Later in that same mission, another Hellcat clipped an electrical transmission line, tearing off a part of its left wing. However, the pilot was able to maneuver the plane into a safe landing onto a ground runway at Ramatuelle.

At the end of the day on 21 August, after the escort carriers had retrieved their aircraft, (incidentally, during this process, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; recorded her 2,000th landing), Task Group 88.2 retired to Maddalena, Sardinia, to refuel and resupply. However, finding bombs trimmed to the American standard that would enable them to be utilized by her Hellcats proved to be an elusive task, even after proceeding southwards to Propriano, Corsica. Thus, the ordnancemen on &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; found it necessary to grind the bomb suspension lugs of other bombs in order to trim them to the extent such that they would be compatible with her Hellcats&#x27; bomb racks. The task group was back off the coast of the French Riviera on 23 August, but by then, the frontlines had proceeded farther inland and quieted down. &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot;″s F6F-3N night fighters had their radar gunsights stripped off, with the intention of only using them for screening missions from then onwards. Nonetheless, both &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; and &quot;Tulagi&quot; continued conducting close air support missions until 30 August, when the task group headed for Ajaccio, Corsica, and dissolved, with ground based air bases having been secured and repaired to the extent as to render the escort carriers redundant. In the course of thirteen days of frontline duty, the two escort carriers had lost 11 Hellcats, but shot down 8 German planes, destroyed 825 trucks and other vehicles, damaging 334 more, destroyed 84 locomotives, and recorded significant damage on German supply lines and infrastructure. Three of the men from VF-74 and VOF-1 received Navy Crosses during that short period of combat.

Leaving her aircraft contingent behind, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; first headed back to Oran, before leaving port on 6 September, arriving back at Norfolk on 18 September. She conducted another roundtrip aircraft transport mission to Casablanca in late October, returning to the East Coast in November. There, Captain Albert Noble Perkins took over command of the vessel, and she was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet. Steaming westwards, she arrived at San Diego on 2 January 1945, and ferried aircraft to Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Ulithi throughout January, where they would be used to resupply the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force. Having completed her mission, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 February, where she served as a training carrier, providing pilot qualifications in the waters off of Hawaii. She continued this duty until early June, when she was assigned to conduct antisubmarine operations in the shipping lines between the Marshall and Mariana Islands. Whilst she was undergoing these duties, word came of the Japanese surrender.

===Post-war===
Upon hearing of the end of the war, &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; returned to Guam, where she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She departed Saipan on 13 September with her first load of servicemen, steaming into San Diego on 30 September. Throughout the next three months, she made three cruises to Hawaii and the Philippines. Upon returning to San Francisco on 28 December, she headed for the East Coast on 29 January 1946, arriving at Boston on 22 February. She was decommissioned and mothballed on 31 July 1946, joining the Boston group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier, receiving the hull symbol CVHE-69. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and she was sold for scrapping on 2 February 1960. She was ultimately broken up in Hamburg, West Germany during March 1960. &quot;Kasaan Bay&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service.
