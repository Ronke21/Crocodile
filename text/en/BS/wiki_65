<text>Charles Atlas (born Angelo Siciliano; October 30, 1892December 24, 1972) was an American bodybuilder best remembered as the developer of a bodybuilding method and its associated exercise program which spawned a landmark advertising campaign featuring his name and likeness; it has been described as one of the longest-lasting and most memorable ad campaigns of all time.

Atlas trained himself to develop his body from that of a &quot;scrawny weakling&quot;, eventually becoming the most popular bodybuilder of his day. He took the name &quot;Charles Atlas&quot; after a friend told him that he resembled the statue of Atlas on top of a hotel in Coney Island and legally changed his name in 1922. He marketed his first bodybuilding course with health and fitness writer Frederick Tilney in November 1922. The duo ran the company out of Tilney&#x27;s home for the first six months. In 1929, Tilney sold his half of the business to advertising man Charles P. Roman and moved to Florida. Charles Atlas Ltd. was founded in 1929 and, as of 2023, continues to market a fitness program for the &quot; weakling&quot;. The company is now owned by Jeffrey C. Hogue.

==History==

Angelo Siciliano was born in Acri, Cosenza, on October 30, 1892. Angelino, as he was also called, moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1904, and eventually became a leather worker. He tried many forms of exercise initially, using weights, pulley-style resistance, and gymnastic-style calisthenics. Atlas claimed that they did not build his body. He was inspired by other fitness and health advocates who preceded him, including world-renowned strongman Eugen Sandow and Bernarr MacFadden (a major proponent of &quot;physical culture&quot;). He was too poor to join the local YMCA, so he watched how exercises were performed, then performed them at home. He attended the strongman shows at Coney Island, and would question the strongmen about their diets and exercise regimens after the show. He would read &quot;Physical Culture&quot; magazine for further information on health, strength, and physical development, and finally developed his own system of exercises that was later called &quot;Dynamic Tension&quot;, a phrase coined by Charles Roman.

A bully kicked sand into Siciliano&#x27;s face at a beach when he was a youth, according to the story that he always told. At this time in his life, also according to the story, he weighed only . According to several stories and claims, he was at the zoo watching a lion stretch when he thought to himself, &quot;Does this old gentleman have any barbells, any exercisers? ... And it came over me. ... He&#x27;s been pitting one muscle against another!&quot; None of the exercises in the Dynamic Tension course could be attributed to how lions use their bodies. Other exercise courses of the time contained exercises similar to Atlas&#x27;s course, particularly those marketed by Bernarr Macfadden and Earle E. Liederman.

Macfadden, publisher of the magazine &quot;Physical Culture&quot;, dubbed Siciliano &quot;America&#x27;s Most Handsome Man&quot; in 1921, and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Perfectly Developed Man&quot; in a 1922 contest held in Madison Square Garden. He soon took the role of strongman in the Coney Island circus side show. Atlas never actually won a title anywhere proclaiming him to be the &quot;world&#x27;s most perfectly developed man&quot;.

In 1922, 30-year-old Siciliano officially changed his name to &quot;Charles Atlas&quot; as it sounded much more American. He met Frederick Tilney, a British homeopathic physician and course writer who was employed as publisher Bernarr MacFadden&#x27;s &quot;ideas man&quot;. Atlas and Tilney met through MacFadden, who was using Atlas as a model for a short movie titled &quot;The Road to Health&quot;. Atlas wrote a fitness course and then asked Tilney to edit it. Tilney agreed and Atlas went into business in 1922.

==Dynamic Tension program==
Atlas&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Tension&quot; program consists of twelve lessons and one final perpetual lesson. Each lesson is supplemented with photos of Atlas demonstrating the exercises. Atlas&#x27;s lesson booklets added commentary that referred to the readers as his friends and gave them an open invitation to write him letters to update him on their progress and stories. Among the people who took Atlas&#x27;s course were Max Baer, heavyweight boxing champion from 1934 to 1935; Rocky Marciano, heavyweight boxing champion from 1952 to 1956; Joe Louis, heavyweight boxing champion from 1937 to 1949; British heavyweight weightlifting champion and Darth Vader actor David Prowse; and Allan Wells, the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games 100 meter champion.

==Artists&#x27; model==

Besides photographs, Atlas posed for many statues throughout his life. These included Alexander Stirling Calder&#x27;s &quot;Washington at Peace&quot; (1917–18) on the Washington Square Arch, Manhattan; Pietro Montana&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of Glory&quot; (1924) in Highland Park, Brooklyn (sometimes misreported as Prospect Park); and James Earle Frazer&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; (1923) at the U.S. Treasury Building in Washington, D.C.

==Death==
Atlas began to experience chest pains after exercising during his final years, resulting in his hospitalization in December 1972. He died from a heart attack in the hospital on December 24, 1972, in Long Beach, New York at age 80. He left behind a son, Charles Jr., and a daughter, Diana. His wife, Margaret, had died seven years before. Nunziato Siciliano, Atlas&#x27;s father, who had returned to Italy shortly after arriving in the US in 1903, lived into his 90s. Atlas&#x27;s son, Charles Jr., died in August 2008 at the age of 89.

==Print advertisements==
 The famous Charles Atlas print advertisements became iconic mostly because they were printed in cartoon form from the 1930s on, and in many comic books from the 1940s onwards – in fact continuing long after Atlas&#x27;s death. The typical scenario, usually expressed in comic strip form, presented a skinny young man (usually accompanied by a female companion) being threatened by a bully. The bully pushes down the &quot;97-pound weakling&quot; and the girlfriend joins in the derision. The young man goes home, gets angry (usually demonstrated by his kicking a chair), and sends away for the free Atlas book. Shortly thereafter, the newly muscled hero returns to the place of his original victimization, seeks out the bully, and beats him up. He is rewarded by the swift return of his girlfriend and the admiration of onlookers.

The ad was said to be based on an experience the real Atlas had as a boy. With variations, it was a mainstay of comic books and boys&#x27; magazines for decades. The ads usually conclude with the words &quot;As is true of all the exercises in Atlas&#x27;s course, you can do these exercises almost anywhere.&quot;

Charles Atlas slogans used in advertising copyrighted in 1932 included &quot;Battle Fought in Bed that made Fred a He-Man!&quot;, &quot;Insult that Made a Man out of Mac&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Give You a Body that Men Respect and Women Admire!&quot;. Slogans copyrighted the following year included &quot;97 pound weakling... Who became the World&#x27;s Most Perfectly Developed Man&quot;, and &quot;Just Seven Days that&#x27;s All I Need&quot;.

===&quot;The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac&quot;===
In this, the full-length version, the protagonist, &quot;Mac&quot;, is accosted on the beach by a sand-kicking bully while his date watches. Humiliated, the young man goes home and, after kicking a chair and gambling a three-cent stamp, subscribes to Atlas&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic-Tension&quot; program. Later, the now muscular protagonist goes back to the beach and beats up the bully, becoming the &quot;hero of the beach&quot;. His girl returns while other women marvel at how big his muscles are. (An earlier but otherwise almost identical version, &quot;How Joe&#x27;s Body Brought Him Fame Instead of Shame&quot;, debuted in the 1940s.)

===&quot;The Insult That Turned a &#x27;Chump&#x27; Into a Champ&quot;===
In this version, which debuted in 1941, &quot;Joe&quot; is at a fair with his girl when the bully (who has just shown his strength with the &quot;Ring-the-Bell&quot; game) insults and pushes him. Joe goes home, slams his fist on the table, and orders the free Atlas book. Joe then returns to the fair, rings the bell, and pushes down the bully while his girlfriend reappears to compliment him on his new, powerful physique.

===&quot;Hey, Skinny! Yer Ribs Are Showing!&quot;===
The condensed, four-panel version stars &quot;Joe&quot;, though it is otherwise identical to Mac&#x27;s story. Instead of &quot;Hero of the beach&quot;, the words floating above Joe&#x27;s head are &quot;What a man!&quot;

===&quot;How Jack the Weakling Slaughtered the Dance-Floor Hog&quot;===
Another version of the ad presents a scenario in which &quot;Jack&quot; is dancing with his girlfriend, Helen. They are bumped into by a bully, who comments on how puny Jack is, not even worth beating up. Jack goes home, kicks a chair, and sends away for Atlas&#x27;s &quot;free book&quot;. Later, the muscular Jack finds the bully, punches him, and wins back the admiration of Helen. This time, the words &quot;Hit of the party&quot; float over his head as he basks in the admiration of the other dancers.

<doc id="552511" wikidata="Q1931863" url="?curid=552511" title="Middle East Forum">
<text>The Middle East Forum (MEF) is an American conservative 501(c)(3) think tank founded in 1990 by Daniel Pipes, who serves as its president. MEF became an independent non-profit organization in 1994. It publishes a journal, the &quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot;.

==History==
The Middle East Forum was founded in 1990 by Daniel Pipes as an independent non-profit organization with the mission of “promoting American interests”. In 2002, the MEF advocated for strong U.S. ties with Turkey, Israel, and other pro-American governments in the region, a stable price for oil, human rights, and peaceful conflict resolutions. It publishes the Middle East Quarterly and runs various advocacy programs. Pipes said in 2003 that &quot;militant Islam is the problem and moderate Islam is the answer&quot;, but the left-leaning Center for American Progress and the Southern Poverty Law Center have criticized the MEF for spreading anti-Islamic messages. 

==Activities==
===Support for Tommy Robinson===
In 2018, the MEF stated that it had been &quot;heavily involved&quot; in the release from prison of British anti-Islam activist and far-right political operative Tommy Robinson, who is best known as a co-founder, former spokesman and former leader of the English Defence League (EDL) organization, and for his service as a political adviser to the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), Gerard Batten. They revealed that &quot;the full resources of the Middle East Forum were activated to free Mr. Robinson&quot;, which included:
conferring with Robinson&#x27;s legal team and providing necessary funds; funding, organizing and staffing the &quot;Free Tommy&quot; London rallies on 9 June and 14 July, which was, they claim, reported by &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;; funding travel of the US congressman, Rep. Paul Gosar, Republican from Arizona, to London to address the rallies; and lobbied Sam Brownback, the State Department&#x27;s ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom, to raise the issue with the UK&#x27;s ambassador, which he did. The MEF has itself been considered a part of the counter-jihad movement.

Georgetown University&#x27;s Bridge Initiative reported in 2018 that the MEF had received millions of dollars from Donors Capital Fund ($6,768,000), the William Rosenwald Family Fund, the Middle Road Foundation, and the Abstraction Fund.

===&quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot;===

&quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot; was founded in 1994 by Daniel Pipes and the current editor-in-chief is Efraim Karsh, research professor and former Director of Middle East and Mediterranean Studies at King&#x27;s College London.

====Reception====
In 2002 Juan Cole, a professor at the University of Michigan and a Campus Watch target, accused the journal of making &quot;scurrilous attacks on people&quot;. In 2014, Christopher A. Bail of Duke University described it as a &quot;pseudo-academic&quot; journal with editorial board members who share an ideological outlook, adding that while it appears to present legitimate academic research, it is regularly criticized &quot;as a channel for anti-Muslim polemics&quot;.

====Abstracting and indexing====
The journal is abstracted and indexed in:
*EBSCO databases
*Index Islamicus
*International Bibliography of the Social Sciences
*Modern Language Association Database
*ProQuest databases
*Scopus

===Campus Watch===
In 2002, the Middle East Forum launched an initiative called Campus Watch that it claimed would identify &quot;analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students&quot; within academia. Winfield Myers is the director of Campus Watch.

Initially, Campus Watch published the profile of eight university professors and teachers, who, it said, were &quot;hostile&quot; to America and &quot;preaching dangerous rhetoric to students&quot;. This led around 100 professors to accuse Campus Watch of &quot;McCarthyesque&quot; intimidation and ask that their names be listed on Campus Watch too. Subsequently, Campus Watch removed the list from its website.

=== Israel Victory Project===
The Israel Victory Project, launched in 2017, is an initiative aimed at securing an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by putting pressure on Palestinians to end anti-Israel terrorism and acknowledge Israel&#x27;s legitimacy as a Jewish state, rather than through bilateral negotiations. Daniel Pipes has stated that &quot;Peace is not made with enemies; peace is made with former enemies.&quot;

<text>Dissertation on the English Language was a book written by American lexicographer Noah Webster in 1789. The book followed Webster&#x27;s 1783 work &quot;Spelling Book&quot; and aimed to differentiate American English from British English. In the book, Webster commented that &quot;our honor requires us to have a system of our own, in language as well as government. Great Britain ... should no longer be &quot;our&quot; standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.&quot; This dissertation was dedicated to Benjamin Franklin.

<text>Newell Convers Wyeth (October 22, 1882 – October 19, 1945), known as N. C. Wyeth, was an American painter and illustrator. He was a student of Howard Pyle and became one of America&#x27;s most well-known illustrators. Wyeth created more than 3,000 paintings and illustrated 112 books — 25 of them for &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, the Scribner Classics, which is the body of work for which he is best known. The first of these, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, was one of his masterpieces and the proceeds paid for his studio. Wyeth was a realist painter at a time when the camera and photography began to compete with his craft. Sometimes seen as melodramatic, his illustrations were designed to be understood quickly. Wyeth, who was both a painter and an illustrator, understood the difference, and said in 1908, &quot;Painting and illustration cannot be mixed—one cannot merge from one into the other.&quot;

He is the father of Andrew Wyeth and the grandfather of Jamie Wyeth, both also well-known American painters.

==Early life ==

Wyeth was born in 1882, in Massachusetts to parents Andrew Newell Wyeth II and Henriette Zirngiebel Wyeth. An ancestor, Nicholas Wyeth, a stonemason, came to Massachusetts from England in 1645. Later ancestors were prominent participants in the French and Indian Wars, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War, passing down rich oral histories and tradition to Wyeth and his family and providing subject matter for his art, which was deeply felt. His maternal ancestors came from Switzerland, and during her childhood, his mother was acquainted with literary giants Henry David Thoreau and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His literary appreciation and artistic talents appear to have come from her.

He was the oldest of four brothers who spent much time hunting, fishing, and enjoying other outdoor pursuits, and doing chores on their farm. His varied youthful activities and his naturally astute sense of observation later aided the authenticity of his illustrations and obviated the need for models: &quot;When I paint a figure on horseback, a man plowing, or a woman buffeted by the wind, I have an acute sense of the muscle strain.&quot;

His mother encouraged his early inclination toward art. Wyeth was doing excellent watercolor paintings by the age of twelve. He went to Mechanics Arts School to learn drafting, and then Massachusetts Normal Art School, now Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where painting instructor Richard Andrew advised him to become an illustrator, and then the Eric Pape School of Art to learn illustration, under George Loftus Noyes and Charles W. Reed.

==Career==
Wyeth traveled to the Brandywine Valley to study with Howard Pyle, eventually settling in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. A bucking bronco for the cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on February 21, 1903, was Wyeth&#x27;s first commission as an illustrator. That year he described his work as &quot;true, solid American subjects—nothing foreign about them&quot;.

It was a spectacular accomplishment for the twenty-year-old Wyeth, after just a few months under Pyle&#x27;s tutelage. In 1904, the same magazine commissioned him to illustrate a Western story, and Pyle urged Wyeth to go West to acquire direct knowledge, much as Zane Grey had done for his Western novels. In Colorado, he worked as a cowboy alongside the professional &quot;punchers&quot;, moving cattle and doing ranch chores. He visited the Navajo in Arizona and New Mexico and gained an understanding of aboriginal American culture. When his money was stolen, he worked as a mail carrier, riding between the Two Grey Hills, New Mexico trading post and Fort Defiance, Arizona, to earn enough to get back home. He wrote home, &quot;The life is wonderful, strange—the fascination of it clutches me like some unseen animal—it seems to whisper, &#x27;Come back, you belong here, this is your real home.&#x27;&quot;

On a second trip two years later, he collected information on mining and brought home costumes and artifacts, including cowboy and aboriginal American clothing. His early trips to the western United States inspired a period of images of cowboys and aboriginal Americans that dramatized the Old West.

Upon returning to Chadds Ford, he painted a series of farm scenes for &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, finding the landscape less dramatic than that of the West but nonetheless a rich environment for his art: &quot;Everything lies in its subtleties, everything is so gentle and simple, so unaffected.&quot; His painting &quot;Mowing&quot; (1907), not done for illustration, was among his most successful images of rural life.

In 1906, Wyeth had married Carolyn Brenneman Bockius of Wilmington. In 1908 they moved to Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, along the Brandywine Creek. The Wyeths created a stimulating household for their talented children Andrew Wyeth, Henriette Wyeth Hurd, Carolyn Wyeth, Ann Wyeth McCoy, and Nathaniel C. Wyeth. In 1937, Nathaniel would marry Howard Pyle&#x27;s niece. Wyeth was very sociable, and frequent visitors included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joseph Hergesheimer, Hugh Walpole, Lillian Gish, and John Gilbert.

According to Andrew, who spent the most time with his father due to his sickly childhood, Wyeth was a strict but patient father who did not talk down to his children. His hard work as an illustrator gave his family the financial freedom to follow their own artistic and scientific pursuits.

Andrew went on to become one of the foremost American painters of the second half of the 20th century, and both Henriette and Carolyn became painters also; Ann became a painter and composer. Nathaniel became an engineer for DuPont and worked on the team that invented the plastic soda bottle. Henriette and Ann married two of Wyeth&#x27;s protégés, Peter Hurd and John W. McCoy. Wyeth is the grandfather of painters Jamie Wyeth and Michael Hurd, and the musician Howard Wyeth.

By 1911, Wyeth began to move away from Western subjects and on to illustrating classic literature. He painted a series for an edition of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1911), by Robert Louis Stevenson, thought by many to be his finest group of illustrations. The set made him famous, and the proceeds from this great success paid for his house and studio. He also illustrated editions of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1913), &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1917), &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1919), &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1920), &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1921), &quot;The White Company&quot; (1922), and &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1939). He did work for prominent periodicals, including &quot;Century&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Outing&quot;, &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot;, and Scribner&#x27;s.

By 1914, Wyeth loathed the commercialism upon which he became dependent, and for the rest of his life he battled internally over his capitulation, accusing himself of having &quot;bitched myself with the accursed success in skin-deep pictures and illustrations&quot;. He complained of money men &quot;who want to buy me piecemeal&quot; and that &quot;an illustration must be made practical, not only in its dramatic statement, but it must be a thing that will adapt itself to the engravers&#x27; and printers&#x27; limitations. This fact alone kills that underlying inspiration to create thought. Instead of expressing that inner feeling, you express the outward thought… or imitation of that feeling.&quot;

Wyeth also did posters, calendars, and advertisements for clients such as Lucky Strike, Cream of Wheat, and Coca-Cola, as well as paintings of Beethoven, Wagner, and Liszt for Steinway &amp; Sons. He painted murals of historical and allegorical subjects for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Westtown School, the First National Bank of Boston, the Hotel Roosevelt, the Franklin Savings Bank, the National Geographic Society, the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, and other public and private buildings. During both World Wars, he contributed patriotic images to government and private agencies. Wyeth was a member of The Franklin Inn Club in Philadelphia.
His nonillustrative portrait and landscape paintings changed dramatically in style throughout his life as he experimented first with impressionism in the 1910s (feeling an affinity with the nearby &quot;New Hope Group&quot;), the principles of the divisionist painter Giovanni Segantini, then by the 1930s veering to the realistic American regionalism of Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, painting with thin oils and, occasionally, egg tempera. That was the medium favored by his son Andrew, and introduced to both of them by his son-in-law Peter Hurd. Wyeth worked rapidly and experimented constantly, often working on a larger scale than necessary, befitting his energetic and grand vision which often harked back to his ancestral past. He could conceive, sketch and paint a large painting in as little as three hours.

Wyeth made four illustrations for a 1939 edition of Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Ramona,&quot; a novel about a Scottish-Native American orphan living in Southern California after the Mexican-American War. The second illustration out of the four, depicting the tension between Ramona and her mother Señora Moreno, was found 80 years later in a Savers thrift store for $4 and sold for $191,000 at auction in 2023.

==Death and legacy==
In June 1945, he had received the honorary degree of Master of Arts from Bowdoin College. Wyeth was a member of the National Academy, the Society of Illustrators, the Philadelphia Water Color Club, the Fellowship of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Chester County Art Association, and the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts. 

In October 1945, Wyeth and his grandson (Nathaniel&#x27;s son, whose name was also Newell) were killed when the automobile they were riding in was struck by a southbound Octoraro Branch freight train at a railway crossing over Ring Road near his Chadds Ford home. His vehicle was carried 143 feet down the line and flipped several times before coming to a stop. At the time, Wyeth had been working on an ambitious series of murals for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company depicting the Pilgrims at Plymouth, a series completed by Andrew Wyeth and John McCoy.

Significant public collections of Wyeth&#x27;s work are on display at the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, in Maine at the Portland Museum of Art, and at the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine. The Brandywine River Museum offers tours of the N. C. Wyeth House and Studio in Chadds Ford. His home and studio were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997, and are open to the public. His studio is set up just as he left it — the palette he used on the day of his death sits by his last canvas.

Wyeth&#x27;s frontispiece illustration depicting Henry David Thoreau’s book “Men of Concord&quot; was destroyed by a fire which occurred at the Maine Wyeth Art Gallery in September 2023.

<text>The standard error (SE) of a statistic (usually an estimator of a parameter, like the average or mean) is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution or an estimate of that standard deviation. In other words, it is the standard deviation of statistic values (each value is per sample that is a set of observations per sampling on the same population). If the statistic is the sample mean, it is called the standard error of the mean (SEM). The standard error is a key ingredient in producing confidence intervals.

The sampling distribution of a mean is generated by repeated sampling from the same population and recording the sample mean per sample. This forms a distribution of different means, and this distribution has its own mean and variance. Mathematically, the variance of the sampling mean distribution obtained is equal to the variance of the population divided by the sample size. This is because as the sample size increases, sample means cluster more closely around the population mean.

Therefore, the relationship between the standard error of the mean and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error of the mean equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In other words, the standard error of the mean is a measure of the dispersion of sample means around the population mean.

In regression analysis, the term &quot;standard error&quot; refers either to the square root of the reduced chi-squared statistic or the standard error for a particular regression coefficient (as used in, say, confidence intervals).

==Standard error of the sample mean==

=== Exact value ===
Suppose a statistically independent sample of formula_1 observations formula_2 is taken from a statistical population with a standard deviation of formula_3 (the standard deviation of the population). The mean value calculated from the sample, formula_4, will have an associated &quot;standard error on the mean&quot;, formula_5, given by:

formula_6

Practically this tells us that when trying to estimate the value of a population mean, due to the factor formula_7, reducing the error on the estimate by a factor of two requires acquiring four times as many observations in the sample; reducing it by a factor of ten requires a hundred times as many observations.

=== Estimate ===
The standard deviation formula_3 of the population being sampled is seldom known. Therefore, the standard error of the mean is usually estimated by replacing formula_3 with the sample standard deviation formula_10 instead:
formula_11

As this is only an estimator for the true &quot;standard error&quot;, it is common to see other notations here such as:
formula_12

A common source of confusion occurs when failing to distinguish clearly between:

* the standard deviation of the &quot;population&quot; (formula_3),
* the standard deviation of the &quot;sample&quot; (formula_10),
* the standard deviation of the &quot;mean&quot; itself (formula_15, which is the standard error), and
* the &quot;estimator&quot; of the standard deviation of the mean (formula_16, which is the most often calculated quantity, and is also often colloquially called the &quot;standard error&quot;).

==== Accuracy of the estimator ====
When the sample size is small, using the standard deviation of the sample instead of the true standard deviation of the population will tend to systematically underestimate the population standard deviation, and therefore also the standard error. With &quot;n&quot; = 2, the underestimate is about 25%, but for &quot;n&quot; = 6, the underestimate is only 5%. Gurland and Tripathi (1971) provide a correction and equation for this effect. Sokal and Rohlf (1981) give an equation of the correction factor for small samples of &quot;n&quot; &lt; 20. See unbiased estimation of standard deviation for further discussion.

=== Derivation ===
The standard error on the mean may be derived from the variance of a sum of independent random variables, given the definition of variance and some properties thereof. If formula_2 is a sample of formula_1 independent observations from a population with mean formula_19 and standard deviation formula_20 (the mean and standard deviation for the population), then we can define the totalformula_21which due to the Bienaymé formula, will have varianceformula_22where we&#x27;ve approximated the standard deviations (i.e., the uncertainties) of the measurements themselves with the standard deviation of the population. The mean of these measurements formula_4 (sample mean) is given byformula_24The variance of the mean is then

formula_25

where a propagation in variance is used in the 2nd equality. The standard error is, by definition, the standard deviation of formula_4 which is the square root of the variance:

formula_27

In other words, if there are a large number of observations per sampling (formula_28 is high compared with the population variance formula_29), then the calculated mean per sample formula_30 is expected to be close to the population mean formula_19.

For correlated random variables, the sample variance needs to be computed according to the Markov chain central limit theorem.

===Independent and identically distributed random variables with random sample size===
There are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion. In such cases, the sample size formula_32 is a random variable whose variation adds to the variation of formula_33 such that,formula_34
which follows from the law of total variance.

If formula_32 has a &quot;Poisson distribution&quot;, then formula_36 with estimator formula_37. Hence the estimator of formula_38 becomes formula_39, leading the following formula for standard error: 
formula_40 
(since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance).

==Student approximation when &quot;σ&quot; value is unknown==

In many practical applications, the true value of &quot;σ&quot; is unknown. As a result, we need to use a distribution that takes into account that spread of possible &quot;σ&quot;&#x27;s.
When the true underlying distribution is known to be Gaussian, although with unknown σ, then the resulting estimated distribution follows the Student t-distribution. The standard error is the standard deviation of the Student t-distribution. T-distributions are slightly different from Gaussian, and vary depending on the size of the sample. Small samples are somewhat more likely to underestimate the population standard deviation and have a mean that differs from the true population mean, and the Student t-distribution accounts for the probability of these events with somewhat heavier tails compared to a Gaussian. To estimate the standard error of a Student t-distribution it is sufficient to use the sample standard deviation &quot;s&quot; instead of &quot;σ&quot;, and we could use this value to calculate confidence intervals.

&quot;Note:&quot; The Student&#x27;s probability distribution is approximated well by the Gaussian distribution when the sample size is over 100. For such samples one can use the latter distribution, which is much simpler. Also, even though the &#x27;true&#x27; distribution of the population is unknown, assuming normality of the sampling distribution makes sense for a reasonable sample size, and under certain sampling conditions, see CLT. If these conditions are not met, then using a Bootstrap distribution to estimate the Standard Error is often a good workaround, but it can be computationally intensive.

==Assumptions and usage==
An example of how formula_41 is used is to make confidence intervals of the unknown population mean is shown. If the sampling distribution is normally distributed, the sample mean, the standard error, and the quantiles of the normal distribution can be used to calculate confidence intervals for the true population mean. The following expressions can be used to calculate the upper and lower 95% confidence limits, where formula_4 is equal to the sample mean, formula_41 is equal to the standard error for the sample mean, and 1.96 is the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution:

In particular, the standard error of a sample statistic (such as sample mean) is the actual or estimated standard deviation of the sample mean in the process by which it was generated. In other words, it is the actual or estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic. The notation for standard error can be any one of SE, SEM (for standard error of &quot;measurement&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;), or SE.

Standard errors provide simple measures of uncertainty in a value and are often used because:
*in many cases, if the standard error of several individual quantities is known then the standard error of some function of the quantities can be easily calculated;
*when the probability distribution of the value is known, it can be used to calculate an exact confidence interval;
*when the probability distribution is unknown, Chebyshev&#x27;s or the Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequalities can be used to calculate a conservative confidence interval; and
* as the sample size tends to infinity the central limit theorem guarantees that the sampling distribution of the mean is asymptotically normal.

===Standard error of mean versus standard deviation===
In scientific and technical literature, experimental data are often summarized either using the mean and standard deviation of the sample data or the mean with the standard error. This often leads to confusion about their interchangeability. However, the mean and standard deviation are descriptive statistics, whereas the standard error of the mean is descriptive of the random sampling process. The standard deviation of the sample data is a description of the variation in measurements, while the standard error of the mean is a probabilistic statement about how the sample size will provide a better bound on estimates of the population mean, in light of the central limit theorem.

Put simply, the standard error of the sample mean is an estimate of how far the sample mean is likely to be from the population mean, whereas the standard deviation of the sample is the degree to which individuals within the sample differ from the sample mean. If the population standard deviation is finite, the standard error of the mean of the sample will tend to zero with increasing sample size, because the estimate of the population mean will improve, while the standard deviation of the sample will tend to approximate the population standard deviation as the sample size increases.

==Extensions==

=== Finite population correction (FPC) ===

The formula given above for the standard error assumes that the population is infinite. Nonetheless, it is often used for finite populations when people are interested in measuring the process that created the existing finite population (this is called an analytic study). Though the above formula is not exactly correct when the population is finite, the difference between the finite- and infinite-population versions will be small when sampling fraction is small (e.g. a small proportion of a finite population is studied). In this case people often do not correct for the finite population, essentially treating it as an &quot;approximately infinite&quot; population.

If one is interested in measuring an existing finite population that will not change over time, then it is necessary to adjust for the population size (called an enumerative study). When the sampling fraction (often termed &quot;f&quot;) is large (approximately at 5% or more) in an enumerative study, the estimate of the standard error must be corrected by multiplying by a &quot;finite population correction&quot; (a.k.a.: FPC):

formula_44
which, for large &quot;N&quot;:
formula_45
to account for the added precision gained by sampling close to a larger percentage of the population. The effect of the FPC is that the error becomes zero when the sample size &quot;n&quot; is equal to the population size &quot;N&quot;.

This happens in survey methodology when sampling without replacement. If sampling with replacement, then FPC does not come into play.

===Correction for correlation in the sample===

If values of the measured quantity &quot;A&quot; are not statistically independent but have been obtained from known locations in parameter space x, an unbiased estimate of the true standard error of the mean (actually a correction on the standard deviation part) may be obtained by multiplying the calculated standard error of the sample by the factor &quot;f&quot;:
formula_46
where the sample bias coefficient ρ is the widely used Prais–Winsten estimate of the autocorrelation-coefficient (a quantity between −1 and +1) for all sample point pairs. This approximate formula is for moderate to large sample sizes; the reference gives the exact formulas for any sample size, and can be applied to heavily autocorrelated time series like Wall Street stock quotes. Moreover, this formula works for positive and negative ρ alike. See also unbiased estimation of standard deviation for more discussion.

<text>Dalnerechensk () is a town in Primorsky Krai, Russia. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Iman&quot; (until 1972).

==Names==
It was originally known as Iman (; ), but its Russian name was changed to Dalnerechensk (literally, &quot;a place at a remote river&quot;) in 1972 during a general campaign of cleansing the Chinese-derived toponyms in the Russian Far East. In Chinese, the name &quot;Yiman&quot; continues to be used.

==Geography==
The town is located on the left bank of the Bolshaya Ussurka River, near its mouth in the Ussuri River which here forms the border between Russia and China. The Chinese border is about from the town center. The town is also situated on the Malinovka River, which joins with the Bolshaya Ussurska within the town limits.

One can see the spurs of the Sikhote-Alin ranges from any point of the town in clear weather. Salskaya Hill, an extinct volcano on the banks of the Bolshaya Ussurka, is also situated close to the town. Closeness of the taiga and the mineral springs, Lastochka and Shmakovka, numerous lakes and rivers, an abundance of sunny days, and a quiet measured life of the town make Dalnerechensk a local tourist attraction.

==History==
It was founded by the Cossacks in 1859 as the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Grafskaya (). A railway station was built later in conjunction with the construction of the railway between Khabarovsk and Vladivostok; now the eastern section of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The railway station and settlement were later named after the Iman River. The settlement quickly became a timber center due to the large pine, fir, and spruce trees in the area, and was granted town status in 1917.

The town was heavily damaged during the Russian Civil War. In May 1920, Sergey Lazo, Alexey Lutsky, and Vsevolod Sibirtsev—three Bolsheviks taken prisoner by Japanese intervention troops after the Nikolayevsk Incident—were murdered by the White Army Cossacks at the Muravyovo-Amurskaya railway station near the town. This event was greatly expanded by the Soviet propaganda of later years; allegedly the three were burned alive in the firebox of a steam locomotive. The village and station at Muravyovo were renamed Lazo, as were a number of other places and streets in the krai.

The majority of the monuments in the town are devoted to the events of the Russian Civil War of 1918-1922 and World War II.

In the early 1930s it was planned to build the Vladivostok-Khabarovsk highway, with a hard (gravel) surface, 600 kilometers long. Construction plans were announced at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), held in Moscow from January 26 to February 10, 1934, when the Second Five Year Plan was adopted. Therefore the Red Army formed two brigades of road troops from December 1933 to January 1934. The headquarters of the first brigade was the village of Dmitrievka, Primorsky Region, the second is the city of Khabarovsk. The first brigade was building from Vladivostok to Iman, and the second - from Iman to Khabarovsk.

There is a memorial in the town where frontier-guards who died in 1969 during the Sino-Soviet border conflict on Damansky Island are buried. Sino-Soviet tensions following this event led to a campaign of changing Chinese-derived place names in the region, with the town being renamed Dalnerechensk in 1972.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Dalnerechensk serves as the administrative center of Dalnerechensky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated separately as Dalnerechensk Town Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Dalnerechensk Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Dalnerechensky Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
The economy of the town is mainly represented by woodworking enterprises, such as JSC &quot;Les Export&quot;, JSC &quot;Primorsky DOK&quot;, JSC &quot;Dalnerechensky Lesokombinat&quot;, and others.

===Transportation===
The town has a station on the Trans-Siberian Railway, it is also connected by road to Vladivostok.

==Climate==
Dalnerechensk has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dwb&quot;) with quite dry and very cold winters and very warm and wet summers. Mean annual temperature in the town is . Temperature in July is and in January it is .

<doc id="552533" wikidata="Q642644" url="?curid=552533" title="Limón Province">
<text>Limón () is one of seven provinces in Costa Rica. The province covers an area of 9,189 km2, and has a population of 386,862.

The majority of its territory is situated in the country&#x27;s Caribbean lowlands, though the southwestern portion houses part of an extensive mountain range known as the Cordillera de Talamanca. The province shares its northern border with Nicaragua via the Río San Juan, its western borders with the provinces of Heredia, Cartago, and Puntarenas, and its southern border with Panama via the Río Sixaola. Within the province there are six cantons, or counties, which include Pococí, Guácimo, Siquirres, Matina, Limón, and Talamanca. Each &quot;cantón&quot; has several local districts.

Limón is one of the most culturally diverse of Costa Rica&#x27;s provinces, housing a significant Afro-Caribbean and indigenous population. Several languages (Spanish, Limón Creole) are spoken, and due mainly to its cultural ties to the Caribbean islands, dishes like rice and beans are ubiquitous throughout the province, along with reggae, calypso, and soca music (see &quot;Demographics&quot;).

The capital is Puerto Limón, and other important cities include Siquirres, Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, and Guápiles.

Locals refer to themselves as &quot;limonenses.&quot;

==History==
Columbus was the first European to visit Limón during his fourth and final voyage to the Americas in 1502, setting anchor near Isla Uvita, just off the shore of present-day Puerto Limón. Due mainly to the region&#x27;s hot and inhospitable weather and fervent resistance from indigenous groups, the Spanish tried but eventually gave up the idea of colonizing the Caribbean lowlands and instead opted to exploit the central valley and Pacific regions.

Starting in the early 19th century, Afro-Caribbeans from Bocas del Toro (Panama), San Andrés (Colombia), and Nicaragua visited what is now Tortuguero to hunt turtles from May through September. As years passed, these populations eventually settled along the coast and founded the towns of Cahuita (named after the sangrillo or cawa tree), Old Harbour (Puerto Viejo), Grape Point (Punta Uva), and Manzanillo (named after the manchineel tree). The Afro-Caribbean population established an amicable trading relationship with the region&#x27;s indigenous populations, and this cohesive existence laid the foundation for these two groups to eventually become the most populous in the province.

Limón became accessible to large-scale economic activity and settlement after the government decided to build a railroad from San José to present-day Puerto Limón (or, as the locals call it, Limón). Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez proposed the project in 1870, shortly after his successful coup, as a more efficient means to ship to Europe. Although he secured two English bank loans in 1871 and got the American Henry Meiggs to take on the project, work stopped in 1873 due to financial, logistical, and labor issues. The railroad sat unfinished until the presidency of Próspero Fernández. In 1884, thanks to the effort of the Minister of Public Works, Bernardo Soto, Costa Rica hired Meiggs&#x27; nephew, Minor Keith, to renegotiate Costa Rica&#x27;s debt and complete the project.

Native Costa-Ricans comprised the bulk of the labor force as the railroad began construction, though small proportions of Afro-Caribbeans and Chinese were also hired. When the project entered the Caribbean lowlands, however, many workers died from exhaustion and malaria, which prompted Keith to aggressively recruit outside the country, bringing in large numbers of Jamaicans, Chinese, and even Italians to finish the job. Seeking to minimize fixed costs, Keith planted banana crops along the lines as a cheap source of food for his work force. After finishing the project, but losing money due to low passenger numbers, Keith placed bananas in the empty cars and shipped them to the United States as a (subsequently successful) business experiment.This railroad was built as an export railroad, not a passenger railroad. Combined with the of Caribbean land the Costa Rican government gave him and the success of the banana sales, Keith eventually founded and grew the enormously lucrative United Fruit Company.

Several town names in Limón (mainly in Talamanca) trace their origin to Keith and his associates: Penhurst (just above Cahuita, and actually marked as Penshurt in street signs and local maps), Fields, Olivia, and Margarita (all three lying east of Bribrí, off of route 32).
Ever since major development occurred in Limón, an undercurrent of political resentment has been felt between &quot;limonenses&quot; and the central government. This is especially true for the Afro-Caribbean population, who, until 1948, had to obtain legal permission to leave Limón province, and were not recognized as citizens. Roads and electricity were slow to come to most of the province (the latter did not arrive to Cahuita until late 1976), and the traditional disparity of resources – along with racism – created resentment among some of the Limón population. Recent major investment initiatives are a break with the past, and may help to improve relations between the Caribbean district and the central valley (see &quot;Economy&quot;).

==Geography==
The majority of Limón&#x27;s land lies at sea level, though its western border sees an increase in altitude due largely to the Cordillera de Talamanca. The province&#x27;s indigenous populations largely reside in reserves that occupy much of the &quot;cantón&quot; of Talamanca.

==Climate==

Unlike the rest of the country, Limón does not adhere to the dry-wet season cycle. It rains throughout the year, though the driest months tend to occur in September and October.

==Demographics==

Limón is home to the country&#x27;s largest concentration of Chinese, Afro-Caribbean and indigenous groups (mainly the Bribri, Kéköldi and Cabécar). According to the 2000 census, 16% of Limón&#x27;s population is Afro-Caribbean, 7% is indigenous, less than 1% is Chinese, and nearly 75% consider themselves a mix of Afro-Caribbean, indigenous, Chinese, and/or mestizo blood. Spoken languages include Spanish, an English creole called Limonese Creole, Chinese, English, and the indigenous languages of the province&#x27;s three main groups (the Bribri, KéköLdi, and Babécar).

Due mainly to the surge in tourism starting around the 1970s, Limón is home to a host of foreign expatriates. Among the most common are Americans, Canadians, Nicaraguans, South Americans (mainly Colombian and Ecuadorian), and Europeans (Spanish, Dutch, German, Swiss, and Italian).

==Economy, education, health==

The United Fruit Company laid the foundation of what keeps the &quot;limonense&quot; economy going. Although the fruit conglomerate has long been dismantled, banana and plantain exports remain one of the region&#x27;s top sources of income, as well as the ports of Limón and Moín (administered by the government&#x27;s &quot;Junta de Administración Portuaria y de Desarrollo Económico de la Vertiente Atlántica [Japdeva]&quot;), and tourism.

Although Limón province ranks third in overall poverty statistics, Talamanca ranks as one of the poorest counties in the country, with a significant portion of its mainly indigenous population of nearly 26,000 residents having spotty access to potable water, electricity, and roads. Two major tourist sites – Cahuita and Puerto Viejo/Manzanillo – exist in Talamanca, and taxes collected from and investment due to tourism help keep the municipality afloat. However, local leaders hope to benefit from the government&#x27;s recent major investment initiatives in the province.

Access to education – especially in Talamanca – is a problem that the government has tried to tackle. Whereas about 45% of &quot;limonenses&quot; possess a high-school degree (about the national average), only about 22% of &quot;talamanqueños&quot; (those from Talamanca) have achieved the same qualification. Recognizing the tie between education and poverty, the government recently launched the &quot;avancemos&quot; education initiative, in which poor and at-risk high-school students are eligible for a national scholarship to help pay for school and therefore reduce the chances of dropping out. As of 2009, about 150,000 students receive a stipend (about 47% of the total public-high-school population). Though not officially linked, the government has reported lower drop-out rates over the past few years.

Health care is provided for the province by Hospital Dr. Tony Facio Castro.

==Cultural events==

Every second week of October, Puerto Limón hosts a festival called &quot;carnaval&quot;. The event&#x27;s start is credited to local community leader and activist, Alfred Josiah Henry Smith (known as &quot;Mister King&quot;), who helped organize the first &quot;carnaval&quot; in October 1949. The event coincides with Columbus Day (known locally as &quot;Día de la Raza&quot;) on October 12, and traditionally lasts for a little over a week (to include two weekends). Activities include parades, food, music, dancing, and, on the last night, a concert headed by a major Latino/Caribbean music act in the Parque Vargas. Previous headliners have included Eddy Herrera (2002), Damian Marley (2003), El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico (2005), and T.O.K. (2006).

The festival goes on rain or shine, though at times it is susceptible to local emergencies: Event planners cancelled &quot;carnaval&quot; in 2007 due to a major dengue outbreak that afflicted all of Limón, and again in 2008 due to an epidemic trash-removal problem that has since been resolved.

On August 31, &quot;Día del Negro&quot; (&quot;day of the black person&quot;) is held to showcase the black people in Limón. Everyone wears African garments, and the children and adults play music and dance in the middle of the street to traditional music.

<text>Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff (; 12 September 1688 – 8 March 1731) was a Czech sculptor and carver of the Baroque era.

==Life and career==
Brokoff was born in Červený Hrádek in the Kingdom of Bohemia (today part of Jirkov in the Czech Republic), the second son of Elisabeth and Jan Brokoff. Ferdinand Brokoff&#x27;s work is often compared with the work of Matthias Braun. Initially he mostly helped his father, but from 1708 he worked independently and two years later, at the age of 22, he became known for his work on several statues on Charles Bridge in Prague, including the statuary of &quot;St. Adalbert&quot;, the statue of &quot;St. Gaetano&quot;, the sculpture group of &quot;Francis Borgia&quot;, the statues of &quot;St. Ignatius&quot; and &quot;Francis Xaverius&quot;, and the sculpture group of &quot;Saints John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Ivan&quot; which depicts in its lower section a dungeon in which emaciated Christians are guarded by a dog and a figure in Turkish costume.

Around 1714 Ferdinand Brokoff began working with the Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and moved to Vienna (while still taking commissions from Prague) where he worked on the church of St. Charles Borromei. He was also active in Silesia (Wrocław), but had to return to Prague soon due to progressing tuberculosis. Nevertheless, he continued to sculpt in Prague and made some significant pieces during the 1720s, such as the monumental statuary and pillar at Hradčany Square in 1726. In 1722 he was also commissioned to create 13 pieces of the Calvary to put in the niches of the New Castle Stairway, a project that was never realized.

Towards the end of his life, the illness gradually prevented him from working alone, thus he only created the designs and models, and had them realized by his younger assistants. He died in Prague.

<text>Kiel University, officially the Christian Albrecht University of Kiel, (, abbreviated CAU, known informally as Christiana Albertina) is a public research university in the city of Kiel, Germany. It was founded in 1665 as the &quot;Academia Holsatorum Chiloniensis&quot; by Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and has approximately 27,000 students today. It is the largest, oldest, and most prestigious university in the state of Schleswig-Holstein.

Until 1866, it was not only the northernmost university in Germany but at the same time the 2nd largest university of Denmark. Faculty, alumni, and researchers of Kiel University have won 12 Nobel Prizes. Kiel University has been a member of the German Universities Excellence Initiative since 2006. The Cluster of Excellence The Future Ocean, which was established in cooperation with the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in 2006, is internationally recognized. The second Cluster of Excellence &quot;Inflammation at Interfaces&quot; deals with chronic inflammatory diseases. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy is also affiliated with Kiel University. The university has a great reputation for its focus on public international law. The oldest public international law institution in Germany and Europe – the Walther Schuecking Institute for International Law – is based in Kiel.

== History ==

=== Founding of the University in Kiel ===
The origins of the university in Kiel trace back to the increasing need for well-educated priests during the Reformation. Additionally, the growing involvement of citizens in significant administrative roles contributed to the idea of establishing a university in the duchies. However, wars in the early 17th century and political conflicts between dukes and the king initially delayed these plans. Eventually, Duke Friedrich III commissioned his son, Christian Albrecht, to advance the founding of the university. In 1660, Christian Albrecht succeeded in realizing these plans and selected Kiel as the university&#x27;s location. On October 5, 1665, the university was inaugurated under the name &quot;Christiana Albertina&quot; in a former Franciscan monastery with four lecture halls and a library. At that time, 17 professors taught theology, medicine, law, and the liberal arts.

=== Periods of Growth and Stagnation ===
A significant growth period for the university occurred a century later under Russian Empress Catherine the Great, from whom it received its colors, purple and white. Following the unification of the duchies in 1773, the university continued to flourish as the northernmost German and southernmost Scandinavian university. Nearly 100 years later, the university&#x27;s development stagnated, particularly after Schleswig-Holstein became part of Prussia. From 1870, student numbers began to rise again, and 38 years later, women were also admitted.

=== During and after WWII ===
During the Nazi regime starting in 1933, the university experienced Gleichschaltung, the expulsion of Jewish professors, and the persecution of dissenters. In World War II, many buildings were destroyed by Allied air raids, including the university library in 1942.

=== Post-War Reconstruction and Expansion ===
With the support of the British, teaching resumed as early as November 1945, initially on ships. In the 1960s, a new campus was developed on the Kiel Westring. The student protests of the late 1960s led to a modernization of the university&#x27;s structure. The campus was expanded in 1972 with buildings on Olshausenstraße and new sports facilities, and in 1991, the Faculty of Engineering opened in Kiel-Gaarden. The number of students steadily increased and now stands at about 25,000 to 30,000. The Christian-Albrecht University has not only become an internationally respected university but also one of the largest employers in Kiel.

== Faculties ==
Christian-Albrechts-Universität currently consists of the following eight faculties:
*Faculty of Theology
*Faculty of Law
*Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences
*Faculty of Medicine

<text>The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world&#x27;s two largest socialist states to the brink of war, occurred near Damansky (Zhenbao) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River in Manchuria. Clashes also took place in Xinjiang.

In 1964, the Chinese revisited the matter of the Sino-Soviet border demarcated in the 19th century, originally imposed upon the Qing dynasty by the Russian Empire by way of unequal treaties. Negotiations broke down amid heightening tensions and both sides began dramatically increasing military presence along the border. Sino-Soviet relations worsened further following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Border confrontations escalated in March 1969 when a group of People&#x27;s Liberation Army troops engaged Soviet border guards on Zhenbao Island in Manchuria, resulting in considerable casualties on both sides. Further clashes occurred in August at Tielieketi in Xinjiang and raised the prospect of an all-out nuclear exchange. The crisis de-escalated after Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin met with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in September, and a ceasefire was ordered with a return to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;.

To counterbalance the Soviet threat, the Chinese government sought a rapprochement with the United States. This resulted in a secret visit to China by Henry Kissinger in 1971, which in turn paved the way for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s official visit to China in 1972. Sino-Soviet relations remained sour after the conflict despite the re-opening of border negotiations, which continued inconclusively for a decade. Serious talks did not occur until 1991, when an agreement was reached shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union. The border issues were conclusively resolved between China and Russia following a treaty signed in 2003 and an additional agreement in 2008.

==Background==
Disputes between China and Russia on border issues date back to the eighteenth century.

===History===
Under the governorship of Sheng Shicai (1933–1944) in Northwest China&#x27;s Xinjiang Province, China&#x27;s Kuomintang recognized for the first time the ethnic category of a Uyghur people by following the Soviet ethnic policy. That ethnogenesis of a &quot;national&quot; people eligible for territorialized autonomy broadly benefited the Soviet Union, which organized conferences in Fergana and Semirechye (in Soviet Central Asia) to cause &quot;revolution&quot; in Altishahr (southern Xinjiang) and Dzungaria (northern Xinjiang).

Both the Soviet Union and the White Movement covertly allied with the Ili National Army to fight the Kuomintang in the Three Districts Revolution. Although the mostly Muslim Uyghur rebels participated in pogroms against Han Chinese generally, the turmoil eventually resulted in the replacement of Kuomintang rule in Xinjiang with that of the Chinese Communist Party.

In 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union formed an alliance and both countries accepted the status quo along their border. In 1951, the two countries signed a Border Rivers Navigation Agreement.
As the Sino-Soviet split developed in the 1960s, border tensions emerged. Amid heightening tensions, the Soviet Union and China began border talks. Although the Soviet Union had granted all of the territory of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo to the Chinese Communists in 1945, which decisively assisted them during the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese now indirectly demanded territorial concessions on the basis that the 19th-century treaties transferring ownership of the sparsely-populated Outer Manchuria, concluded by Qing dynasty China and the Russian Empire, were &quot;Unequal Treaties&quot; and amounted to the annexation of rightful Chinese territory. Moscow would not accept that interpretation, but by 1964, both sides had reached a preliminary agreement on the eastern section of the border, including Zhenbao Island, which would be handed over to China.

In July 1964, CCP chairman Mao Zedong, in a meeting with the Japanese Socialist Party delegation, stated that Russia had unilaterally incorporated vast territories in Siberia and the Far East as far as Kamchatka. He stated that China and Russia still had not resolved this issue. The comments were leaked to the public. Outraged, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev refused to approve the border agreement.

===Geography===
The border dispute in the west centered on of Soviet-controlled land in the Pamirs that lay on the border of Xinjiang and the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1892, the Russian Empire and the Qing Dynasty had agreed that the border would consist of the ridge of the Sarikol Range, but the exact border remained contentious throughout the 20th century. In the 1960s, the Chinese began to insist that the Soviet Union evacuate the region.

From around 1900, after the Treaty of Peking (1860) had assigned Outer Manchuria (Primorskiy Kray) to Russia, the eastern part of the Sino-Soviet border had mainly been demarcated by three rivers, the Argun River from the tripartite junction with Mongolia to the north tip of China, running southwest to northeast, then the Amur River to Khabarovsk from northwest to southeast, where it was joined by the Ussuri River running south to north:

There is nothing in either the 1858 or the 1860 treaty to suggest the border is anywhere other than the thalweg.

China claimed the islands, as they were on the Chinese side of the river if they were demarcated according to international law by using shipping lanes. The Soviets claimed and already effectively controlled almost every island along the rivers.

Russia and subsequently the Soviet Union claimed all the islands in both rivers including those that were Chinese according to the thalweg principle. In the 1991 treaty, Russia largely conceded that these islands were Chinese, but Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island, at the confluence of the Amur and the Ussuri Rivers, had become part of the Russian city of Khabarovsk, and China agreed that about two-thirds of the island should remain Russian.

===Chinese and Soviet governments&#x27; views===
The Soviets had possessed nuclear weapons for a longer time than the Chinese and so the Chinese adopted an asymmetric deterrence strategy that threatened a large conventional people&#x27;s war in response to a Soviet counterforce nuclear first strike. Chinese numerical superiority was the basis of its strategy to deter a Soviet nuclear attack. Since 1949, Chinese strategy, as articulated by Mao, emphasized the superiority of &quot;man over weapons&quot;. Although weapons were certainly an important component of warfare, Mao argued that they were &quot;not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive. The contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power, but also a contest of human power and morale.&quot; To Mao, &quot;non-material&quot; factors like &quot;creativity, flexibility and high morale&quot; were also &quot;critical determinants in warfare&quot;.

The Soviets were not confident that they could win such a conflict. A large Chinese incursion could threaten strategic centers in Blagoveshchensk, Vladivostok and Khabarovsk as well as crucial nodes of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. According to Arkady Shevchenko, a high-ranking Soviet defector to the United States, &quot;The Politburo was terrified that the Chinese might make a mass intrusion into Soviet territory&quot;. A nightmare vision of invasion by millions of Chinese made the Soviet leaders almost frantic: &quot;Despite our overwhelming superiority in weaponry, it would not be easy for the USSR to cope with an assault of this magnitude&quot;. China&#x27;s &quot;vast population and deep knowledge and experience in guerrilla warfare&quot; would nearly certainly cause the Soviets&#x27; launching of an attack on China&#x27;s nuclear program to end in both states being &quot;mired in an endless war&quot;.

Concerns about Chinese manpower and its people&#x27;s war strategy ran so deep that some bureaucrats in Moscow argued that the only way to defend against a massive conventional onslaught was to use nuclear weapons. Some even advocated deploying nuclear mines along the Sino-Soviet border. By threatening to initiate a prolonged conventional conflict in retaliation for a nuclear strike, Beijing used an asymmetric deterrence strategy that was intended to convince Moscow that the costs of an attack would outweigh the benefits.

China had found its strategic rationale. While most Soviet military specialists did not fear a Chinese nuclear reprisal and believed that China&#x27;s arsenal was too small, rudimentary, and vulnerable to survive a first strike and to carry out a retaliatory attack, China&#x27;s massive conventional army caused great concern.

Nikolai Ogarkov, a senior Soviet military officer, believed that a massive nuclear attack &quot;would inevitably mean world war&quot;. Even a limited counterforce strike on China&#x27;s nuclear facilities was dangerous, Ogarkov argued, because a few nuclear weapons would &quot;hardly annihilate&quot; a country the size of China, which, in response, would &quot;fight unrelentingly&quot;.

==Eastern border: Heilongjiang (1969)==
The Soviet Border Service started to report an intensifying Chinese military activity in the region in the early 1960s. Tensions at first built slowly, but the Cultural Revolution made them rise much faster. The number of troops on both sides of the Sino-Soviet border increased dramatically after 1964. Militarily, in 1961, the Soviets had 225,000 men and 200 aircraft at the border. In 1968, there were 375,000 men, 1,200 aircraft and 120 medium-range missiles. China had 1.5 million men stationed at the border and had tested its first nuclear weapon (the 596 Test in October 1964, at Lop Nur basin). Both sides&#x27; political rhetoric was increasingly hostile.

The key moment in escalating Sino-Soviet tensions was the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia on 20–21 August 1968 and the proclamation of the Brezhnev Doctrine that the Soviets had the right to overthrow any communist government that was diverging from what was defined by the Kremlin. Mao saw the Brezhnev Doctrine as the ideological justification for a Soviet invasion of China to overthrow him and launched a massive propaganda campaign attacking the invasion of Czechoslovakia, although he had condemned the Prague Spring as &quot;revisionism&quot;. On 21 August 1968, the Romanian leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, gave a speech in Revolution Square in Bucharest that denounced the invasion of Czechoslovakia. It was widely seen both in Romania and abroad as virtual declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. Romania began to move away from the Soviet sphere of influence, towards the Chinese sphere of influence.

Speaking at a banquet held at the Romanian embassy in Beijing on 23 August 1968, Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for &quot;fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism and social imperialism&quot;. He went on to compare the invasion of Czechoslovakia to the Americans in the Vietnam War and more pointedly to the policies of Adolf Hitler towards Czechoslovakia in 1938 to 1939. Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the Red Army.

The Chinese historian Li Danhui wrote, &quot;Already in 1968, China began preparations to create a small war on the border.&quot; She noted that prior to March 1969, the Chinese troops had twice attempted to provoke a clash along the border, &quot;but the Soviets, feeling weak, did not accept the Chinese challenge and retreated.&quot; Another Chinese historian, Yang Kuisong, wrote, &quot;There were already significant preparations in 1968, but the Russians did not come, so the planned ambush was not successful.&quot;

=== Battle of Zhenbao (Damansky) Island ===

On 2 March 1969, a group of People&#x27;s Liberation Army troops ambushed Soviet border guards on Zhenbao Island. According to Chinese sources, the Soviets suffered 58 dead and wounded. The Chinese losses were reported as 29 dead. According to Soviet sources, at least 248 Chinese troops were killed on the island and on the frozen river, and 32 Soviet border guards were killed, with 14 wounded.

Both sides have since blamed the other for the start of the conflict. However, a scholarly consensus has emerged that the border crisis had been a premeditated act of aggression orchestrated by the Chinese side. The American scholar Lyle J. Goldstein noted that Russian documents released since the &quot;glasnost&quot; era paint an unflattering picture of the Red Army command in the Far East with senior generals surprised by the outbreak of the fighting and of Red Army units haphazardly committed to action in a piecemeal style, but all of the documents speak of the Chinese as the aggressors. Most Chinese historians agree that on 2 March 1969, Chinese forces planned and executed an ambush, which took the Soviets completely by surprise. The reasons for the Chinese leadership to opt for such an offensive measure against the Soviets remains a disputed question.

According to Robinson, who based his analysis mostly on Soviet sources due to the lack of factual reports from the Chinese at the time of writing, on 2 March around 11:00 Chinese forces ambushed an unsuspecting Soviet border patrol on the island and inflicted heavy losses on the patrol. Shortly, Soviet reinforcements arrived from the nearby outpost and allegedly pinned the Chinese down, surrounded them for a time and then forced the remaining Chinese to retreat to their side of the bank. The entire battle lasted about two hours. Both sides claimed victory, however, neither force remained permanently on the island after the battle was over, although the Soviets periodically moved off and on at will.

Robinson wrote that it is not clear who began a battle of 15 March. Both sides claimed that the other side attacked their early-morning patrol. The battle started around 09:45 or 10:00 with artillery fire from the Chinese bank. Initially an outnumbering Chinese force managed to make Soviets to either leave the island entirely or withdraw to its eastern extremity. A consequent counterattack by Russian tanks and mechanized infantry supported by three waves of intense artillery fire at 13:00 apparently broke the Chinese positions on the island and the Chinese retreated to their own bank. The battle was over at 19:00. Soviets did not follow up the Chinese retreat with large-scale garrisoning of the island, although they continued intense patrolling.

There is an alternative interpretation of the events. The Cultural Revolution increased tensions between China and the Soviets, which led to brawls between border patrols. On 27 December 1968, several Soviet armored vehicles landed on Zhenbao Island, and Soviet soldiers used sticks to beat Chinese soldiers. On 23 January 1969, another violent conflict occurred on the island, and 28 Chinese soldiers were reportedly wounded. From 6 to 25 February 1969, five more similar incidents occurred, and shooting broke out in March 1969. According to the Chinese version of events, at 08:40 on the 2 March 1969, 30 Chinese border patrol personnel split into two groups approached the island and were met by about 70 Soviet soldiers along with one truck and reinforced with two armoured vehicles attempting to encircle the Chinese patrol. The Chinese claim the Soviets had opened fire at 09:17. The Soviets responded with tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), and artillery bombardment. Over three days, the PLA successfully halted Soviet penetration and eventually evicted all Soviet troops from Zhenbao Island. During the skirmish, the Chinese deployed two reinforced infantry platoons with artillery support. Chinese sources state the Soviets deployed some 60 soldiers and six BTR-60 amphibious APCs, and in a second attack, some 100 troops backed up by 10 tanks and 14 APCs including artillery. The PLA had prepared for that confrontation for two to three months.

From among the units, the Chinese selected 900 soldiers commanded by army staff members with combat experience. They were provided with special training and special equipment and were secretly dispatched to take position on Zhenbao Island in advance. Chinese General Chen Xilian stated the Chinese had won a clear victory on the battlefield.

On 15 March, initial Soviet attacks were repulsed after suffering heavy losses. The Soviet border troops did not fight again, a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Smirnov from the 135th Motorized Infantry Division went on the attack. The battalion, which came under heavy machine gun fire from the Chinese, sustained heavy losses and withdrew from the island. By the end of 15 March Soviet General Oleg Losik ordered to deploy then-secret BM-21 &quot;Grad&quot; multiple rocket launchers. The Soviets fired 10,000 artillery rounds in a nine-hour engagement with the Chinese along with 36 sorties.
Soviet officials believed the attack was devastating for the Chinese troops and materials, which could not be verified by Chinese sources. The Chinese troops left their positions on the island, and the Soviets withdrew to their positions on the Russian bank of the Ussuri River. claims that the main group of Chinese troops near the island did not suffer any significant losses as a result of the usage of BM-21 due to a mistake in the calculation by the Headquarters of the Rocket Forces. He claims that after 21:00, the Chinese began firing heavy mortars not only at the island but at the Soviet territory as well and Major V. Nesov, commander of the 135th Motorized Infantry Division, was forced to order the division and frontier guards to retreat 4–5 kilometers inland to avoid casualties. Maxwell notes that much of academic writing about the Zhenbao incident still argues that it resulted from an unprovoked aggressive action by China and that the USSR was unquestionably the victor.

On 16 March, the Soviets entered the island to collect their dead, with the Chinese holding their fire. On 17 March, the Soviets tried to recover a disabled T-62 tank from the island, but their effort was repelled by Chinese artillery. On 21 March, the Soviets sent a demolition team in an attempt to destroy the tank. The Chinese opened fire and thwarted the Soviet attempt. With the help of divers from the Chinese navy, the PLA pulled the T-62 tank onshore. The tank was later given to the Chinese Military Museum.

Until 1991, the island remained contested. According to Chinese sources, the Chinese had built barracks and conducted constant presence on the island since August 1969. Ryabushkin claims that the Soviet border guards had continued to thwart all Chinese attempts to land on it until 10 September when they were ordered to cease fire, effectively surrendering the island, in preparation for the Kosygin-Zhou talks that happened on 11 September.
===Soviet combat heroes===

Five Soviet soldiers were awarded the top honour of Hero of the Soviet Union for bravery and valor during the Damansky conflict. Colonel Demokrat Leonov led the group of four T-62 tanks in a counterattack on 15 March and was killed by a Chinese sniper when he was leaving a destroyed vehicle.

Senior Lieutenant Vitaly Bubenin led a relief mission of 23 soldiers from the nearby border guard&#x27;s outpost and conducted a BTR-60 raid into the Chinese rear that allegedly left 248 attackers dead. Junior Sergeant Yuri Babansky assumed command in a battle on 2 March, when the enemy had a 10–1 superiority, and when Senior Lieutenant Strelnikov was killed. Babansky later led combat search-and-rescue teams, which retrieved the bodies of Strelnikov and Leonov. Junior Sergeant Vladimir Orekhov took part in the 15 March battle. As a machine gunner, he was part of the first attacking line against the Chinese forces encamped on the island. He destroyed the enemy machine gun nest and was wounded twice, but he continued to fight until he died of his wounds. High military orders of Lenin, the Red Banner, the Red Star and Glory were awarded to 54 soldiers and officers, and the medals &quot;For Courage&quot; and &quot;For Battle Merit&quot; to 94 border guards and servicemen.

===Chinese combat heroes===
During the Zhenbao Island clashes with the Soviet Army in March 1969 one Chinese RPG team, Hua Yujie and his assistant Yu Haichang destroyed four Soviet APCs and achieved more than ten kills. Hua and Yu received the accolade &quot;Combat Hero&quot; from the CMC, and their action was commemorated on a postage stamp.

==Diplomacy==
On 17 March 1969, an emergency meeting of the Warsaw Pact was called in Budapest by Brezhnev with the aim of condemning China. Romania&#x27;s Ceaușescu refused, despite considerable Soviet pressure, to sign the statement condemning China. Ceaușescu&#x27;s intransigence led to no statement being issued, which was widely seen as a Soviet diplomatic defeat. The next day, a meeting of the delegations representing 66 communist parties in Moscow discussed the preparations for a world summit in Moscow on 5 June 1969. A Soviet motion to condemn China failed, with the delegations representing the communist parties of Romania, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Austria all supporting the Chinese position that it was the Soviet Union that had attacked China, rather than vice versa.

On 21 March, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin tried to phone Mao with the aim of discussing a ceasefire. The Chinese operator who took Kosygin&#x27;s call called him a &quot;revisionist element&quot; and hung up. Zhou, who wanted to take up Kosygin&#x27;s ceasefire offer, was shocked by what he regarded as Mao&#x27;s recklessness: &quot;The two countries are at war, one cannot chop the messenger.&quot; Diplomats from the Soviet embassy in Beijing spent much of 22 March in vain trying to get hold of Mao&#x27;s private phone number so that Kosygin could call him to discuss peace. On 22 March, Mao had a meeting with the four marshals who commanded the Chinese troops in the border regions with the Soviet Union to begin preparations for a possible all-out war. Zhou repeatedly urged Mao to discuss a ceasefire but agreed with Mao&#x27;s refusal to take phone calls from Kosygin. In an effort to placate Zhou, Mao told him, &quot;Immediately prepare to hold diplomatic negotiations.&quot;

Between 1 and 24 April, the 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party took place, and Mao proclaimed the official end of the Cultural Revolution, which he had begun in May 1966. Despite the official end of the Cultural Revolution, the Congress elected to key positions followers of the ultraleftist factions associated with Mao&#x27;s powerful wife, Jiang Qing, and Defense Minister Lin Biao. Both Jiang and Lin favored a hard line towards the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, Mao had ordered preparations for a &quot;defense in depth&quot; along the border because real fears had arisen of the border crisis escalating into all-out war. On 1 May, in a bid to repair China&#x27;s image abroad, which had been badly damaged by the Cultural Revolution, Mao invited diplomats from several Third World nations to attend the May Day celebrations in Beijing. To the assembled diplomats, Mao formally apologized for the attacks by the Red Guards on diplomats in China and the smashing up of the embassies in Beijing in 1967. Mao claimed not to be aware of the fact that the Red Guards had been beating up and sometimes killing foreigners living in China during the Cultural Revolution. Also, Mao announced that for the first time since the Cultural Revolution, he would send out ambassadors to represent China abroad (most Chinese ambassadors had been recalled and executed during the Cultural Revolution with no replacements having been sent). By then, Mao had felt that China&#x27;s isolation caused by the Cultural Revolution had become a problem since China was now on the brink of a war with the Soviet Union.

On 5 May, Kosygin traveled to India, which was strongly against China, to discuss with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi the possibility of a Soviet-Indian alliance against China. Between 14 and 19 May, Nikolai Podgorny visited North Korea to try to pull Kim Il Sung away from the Chinese orbit. Kim declined to move away from China, and in a show of support for Mao, North Korea sent no delegation to the world conference of communist parties that was held in Moscow in June.

On 17 June, US Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, who had long been an advocate of normalizing American relations with China, wrote a letter, in consultation with the White House, that urged Mao to allow him to visit China and to meet with Mao to discuss measures to improve Sino-American relations. The letter was sent to King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia with the request to pass it on to Mao, and by 26 July, Mansfield&#x27;s letter had arrived in Beijing. The Chinese reply was harsh, with Zhou giving a speech accusing the US of &quot;aggression&quot; in Vietnam and of &quot;occupation&quot; of Taiwan, which Zhou asserted was rightfully a part of China. On 1 August, US President Richard Nixon visited Pakistan, a close ally of China since both were anti-Indian, to ask General Yahya Khan to pass a message to Mao that he wanted to normalize relations with China, especially due to the crisis with the Soviet Union.

On 2–3 August, Nixon visited Romania to meet with Ceaușescu and ask him to pass along the same message to Mao. Ceaușescu agreed to do so, and on 7 September, Romanian Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer, who was in Hanoi to attend the funeral of Ho Chi Minh, took Zhou aside to tell him that Nixon wanted an opening to China.

==Western border: Xinjiang (1969)==
=== Background ===
Soviet historiography, more specifically &quot;Uyghur Studies,&quot; was increasingly politicized to match the tension of the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s and the 1970s. One Soviet Turkologist, Tursun Rakhminov, who worked for the Soviet Communist Party, argued that the modern Uyghurs had founded the ancient Toquz Oghuz Country (744–840), the Kara-Khanid Khanate (840–1212), and so forth. The premodern states&#x27; wars against Chinese dynasties were cast as struggles for national liberation by the Uyghur ethnic group. Soviet historiography was not consistent on those issues; when Sino-Soviet relations were warmer, for example, the Three Districts Revolution was portrayed by Soviet historians as part of opposition to the Kuomintang during the Chinese Civil War, not as an anti-Chinese bid for national liberation. The Soviets also encouraged migration of Uyghurs to its territory in Kazakhstan, along the 4,380 km (2,738 mi) border. In May 1962, 60,000 Uyghurs from Xinjiang Province crossed the frontier into the Soviet Union to flee the famine and economic chaos of the Great Leap Forward.

=== Xinjiang clashes ===
On 10 June, 50 Soviet soldiers attacked Chinese forces in Xinjiang. 

On 13 August, approximately 300 Soviet soldiers supported by tanks and two helicopters attacked and defeated Chinese forces in Tielieketi. The heightened tensions raised the prospect of an all-out nuclear exchange between China and the Soviet Union.

==Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s funeral==
The decisive event that stopped the crisis from escalating into all-out war was the death of Ho Chi Minh on 2 September 1969. His funeral was attended by both Zhou and Kosygin, albeit at different times. Zhou flew out of Hanoi to avoid being in the same room as Kosygin. The possibility of North Vietnam&#x27;s leading supporters going to war with each other alarmed the North Vietnamese. During the funeral, messages were exchanged between the Soviets and the Chinese via the North Vietnamese. Meanwhile, Nixon&#x27;s message via Maurer had reached the Chinese, and it was decided in Beijing to &quot;whet the appetite of the Americans&quot; by making China appear stronger.

Zhou argued that a war with the Soviets would weaken China&#x27;s hand towards the United States. The Chinese were more interested in the possibility of a rapprochement with the United States as a way of acquiring Taiwan than in having the United States ally with them against the Soviet Union. After Kosygin had attended Ho&#x27;s funeral, the airplane taking him back to Moscow was denied permission to use Chinese air space, which forced it to land for refuelling in Calcutta. In India, Kosygin received the message via the Indian government that the Chinese were willing to discuss peace, which caused him to fly back to Beijing instead.

== Assessment ==
=== State of near war ===
In the early 1960s, the United States had &quot;probed&quot; the level of Soviet interest in joint action against Chinese nuclear weapons facilities; the Soviets were only willing to persuade China to sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Now the Soviets probed what the US reaction would be if the Soviets attacked the facilities. Whether this was part of an attempt to intimidate China, a real Soviet contingency plan, or both is unclear, but the Soviets approached other foreign governments, and the leadership of Communist parties in several countries; the intention was likely to have them communicate the Soviet nuclear threat to China. Noting that &quot;neither side wishes the inflamed border situation to get out of hand&quot;, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in August 1969 described the conflict as having &quot;explosive potential&quot; in the President&#x27;s Daily Briefing. The agency stated that &quot;the potential for a war between them clearly exists&quot;, including a Soviet attack on Chinese nuclear facilities, and China &quot;appears to view the USSR as its most immediate enemy&quot;. Allen S. Whiting suggested that the Soviets might feel forced to use tactical nuclear weapons against Chinese human wave attacks after a strike on nuclear facilities.

The Chinese did not believe that a Soviet nuclear attack was likely until 27 August, when CIA director Richard Helms announced that the Soviets had asked foreign governments what their reaction would be to a preemptive attack on China. Although Helms did not include the Soviet probe to the US in the announcement, to China the announcement meant that the US took the Soviet probes seriously, so the threat of an imminent Soviet attack must be real. The United States took steps to ready its nuclear bombers.

These steps surprised Mao and prompted Chinese leaders to evacuate Beijing. China sought to reduce the tension and engaged with the Soviet side during Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s funeral. On 11 September, Kosygin, on his way back from the funeral of Ho Chi Minh, stopped over in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou. Symbolic of the frosty relations between the two communist countries, the talks were held at Beijing Airport. Both agreed to return ambassadors who had been recalled and to begin border negotiations. On 23 and 29 September 1969, China conducted two unannounced nuclear weapons tests, with the second one a 3 MT thermonuclear device, to verify its nuclear strike capacity.

=== Possible reasons for attack ===
The interpretation of the reasoning and consequences of the conflict differs. Western historians believe that the events at Zhenbao Island and the subsequent border clashes in Xinjiang were caused mainly by Mao&#x27;s use of Chinese local military superiority to satisfy domestic political imperatives in 1969. Yang Kuisong concludes that &quot;the [Sino-Soviet] military clashes were primarily the result of Mao Zedong&#x27;s domestic mobilization strategies, connected to his worries about the development of the Cultural Revolution.&quot;

Russian historians point out that the consequences of the conflict stem directly from a Chinese desire to take a leading role in the world and to strengthen ties with the United States. According to the 2004 Russian documentary film, &quot;Damansky Island Year 1969,&quot; Mao sought to elevate his country from the world&#x27;s periphery and to place it at the centre of world politics. Other analysts state that the Chinese intended their attack on Zhenbao to deter future Soviet invasions by demonstrating that China could not be &quot;bullied&quot;.

===Result===

Most scholars and analysts describe this conflict to have resulted in a Soviet victory, because the conflict was not over what a final border deal between the USSR and China would look like. Instead, it concerned whether they would hold talks over the border at all. The outcome favored the USSR as China unwillingly submitted to negotiations over the border. The conflict ended on 20 October 1969 after the Chinese agreed with regards to negotiations over the border.

=== Aftermath ===
Seen against the background of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between Brezhnev and Nixon, the Damansky incident could serve the double purpose of undermining the Soviet image of a peace-loving country if the Soviets chose to respond by a massive military operation against the invaders. If they demonstrated Soviet weakness, the Chinese attack could have been left without response. The killing of Soviet servicemen on the border signaled to the US that China had graduated into high politics and was ready to talk.

After the conflict, the US showed interest in strengthening ties with the Chinese government by secretly sending Henry Kissinger to China for a meeting with Zhou in 1971, during the so-called Ping Pong Diplomacy. That paved the way for Nixon to visit China and meet with Mao in 1972.

Sino-Soviet relations remained sour after the conflict, despite the border talks, which began in 1969 and continued inconclusively for a decade. Domestically, the threat of war caused by the border clashes inaugurated a new stage in the Cultural Revolution: China&#x27;s thorough militarization. The 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held in the aftermath of the Zhenbao incident, confirmed Defense Minister Lin Biao as Mao&#x27;s heir apparent. Following the events of 1969, the Soviets further increased their forces along the Sino-Soviet border and in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic.

Overall, the Sino-Soviet confrontation, which reached its peak in 1969, paved the way to a profound transformation in the international political system.

==Border negotiations: 1990s–2000s==

Serious border demarcation negotiations did not occur until shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. In particular, both sides agreed that Zhenbao belonged to China. (Both sides claimed the island to be under their control at the time of the agreement.) On 17 October 1995, an agreement over the last stretch of the border was reached, but the question of control over three islands in the Amur and Argun rivers was left to be settled later.

On 16 July 2001, Russia and China signed the 2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship. Article 9 of the treaty has similarities to NATO&#x27;s Article 5 in that it commits both parties, when one is threatened, to &quot;immediately hold contacts and consultations in order to eliminate such threats&quot;.

In a border agreement between Russia and China signed on 14 October 2003, the final dispute was resolved. China was granted control over Tarabarov Island (Yinlong Island), Zhenbao Island, and around 50% of Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island (Heixiazi Island), near Khabarovsk. The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress ratified the agreement for China on 27 April 2005, and the Russian Duma followed suit on 20 May. On 2 June, Foreign Minister of China, Li Zhaoxing and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, exchanged the ratification documents from their respective governments.

On 21 July 2008, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and his Russian counterpart, Lavrov, signed an additional Sino-Russian Border Line Agreement, marking the acceptance of the demarcation of the eastern portion of the Chinese-Russian border in Beijing, China. An additional protocol with a map affiliated on the eastern part of the borders both countries share was signed. The agreement also includes the Chinese gain of ownership of Yinlong / Tarabarov Island and half of Heixiazi / Bolshoi Ussuriysky Island.

In the 21st century, the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s version of the conflict, which is present on many official Party websites, describes the events of March 1969 as a Soviet aggression against China.

<text>The Typhaceae () are a family of flowering plants, sometimes called the cattail family. The botanical name for the family has been recognized by most taxonomists.

==Description==
Members can be recognized as large marsh herbs with alternate two-ranked leaves and a brownish compact spike of unisexual flowers. The plants have creeping rhizomes. 

The male flowers either lack a perianth or have six scales. They may also have club shaped threads or wedge or spatula shaped scales that are intermingled with the flowers. They have between two and seven stamens.

The female flowers have a perianth of fine hairs or scales. These may be accompanied by slender bracteoles. The ovary is one chambered and contains a single pendulous ovule. The style is simple and the stigma simple and long.

The fruit may or may not be stalked and the pericarp may be thick or thin. The seeds are endospermous with a cylindric embryo.

==Fossils==
The earliest fossils, including pollen and flowers, have been recovered from late Cretaceous deposits.

==Taxonomic history==
The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. The family then consisted of one genus (&quot;Typha&quot;), totalling a dozen species of perennial plants of wet habitats. More recently, the APG III system of 2009 included a second genus, &quot;Sparganium&quot;, in this family. The two genera together have a total of 51 known species.

The Cronquist system, of 1981, also recognized such a family and placed it in the order Typhales, in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta.

The Wettstein system, last updated in 1935, placed the family in order Pandanales.

<doc id="552577" wikidata="Q750826" url="?curid=552577" title="Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency">
<text>Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD deficiency or MCADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation that impairs the body&#x27;s ability to break down medium-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA. The disorder is characterized by hypoglycemia and sudden death without timely intervention, most often brought on by periods of fasting or vomiting.

Prior to expanded newborn screening, MCADD was an underdiagnosed cause of sudden death in infants. Individuals who have been identified prior to the onset of symptoms have an excellent prognosis.

MCADD is most prevalent in individuals of Northern European Caucasian descent, with an incidence of 1:4000 to 1:17,000 depending on the population. Treatment of MCADD is mainly preventive, by avoiding fasting and other situations where the body relies on fatty acid oxidation to supply energy.

==Signs and symptoms==

MCADD presents in early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction, often preceded by extended periods of fasting or an infection with vomiting. Infants who are exclusively breast-fed may present in this manner shortly after birth, due to poor feeding. In some individuals the first manifestation of MCADD may be sudden death following a minor illness. A number of individuals with MCADD may remain completely asymptomatic, provided they never encounter a situation that sufficiently stresses their metabolism. With the advent of expanded newborn screening, some mothers have been identified with MCADD after their infants had positive newborn screens for low carnitine levels.

The enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (&quot;MCAD&quot;) is responsible for the dehydrogenation step of fatty acids with chain lengths between 6 and 12 carbons as they undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Fatty acid beta-oxidation provides energy after the body has used up its stores of glucose and glycogen. This oxidation typically occurs during periods of extended fasting or illness when caloric intake is reduced, and energy needs are increased.

==Genetics==
MCADD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an affected individual must inherit a mutated allele from both of their parents. &quot;ACADM&quot; is the gene involved, located at 1p31, with 12 exons and coding for a protein of 421 amino acids. There is a common mutation among Northern European Caucasians, replacement of an adenine at position 985 with guanine, which results in a substitution of lysine with glutamic acid at position 304 of the protein. Other mutations have been identified more commonly since newborn screening has expanded the mutation spectrum. The 985A&gt;G common mutation is present in the homozygous state in 80% of Caucasian individuals who presented clinically with MCADD and in 60% of the population identified by screening.

An individual&#x27;s genotype does not correlate well with their clinical phenotype for MCADD. The clinical presentation of an individual with MCADD depends not only on the presence of the mutations in the &quot;ACADM&quot; gene, but also on the presence of environmental or physiological stressors that require the body to depend on fatty acid oxidation for energy. Some mutations, identified through newborn screening programs and associated with higher residual enzyme activity have not been seen in individuals with clinical symptoms of MCADD. Despite this, treatment with fasting avoidance remains the norm for all those diagnosed with MCADD.

==Diagnosis==
Clinically, MCADD or another fatty acid oxidation disorder is suspected in individuals who present with lethargy, seizures, coma and hypoketotic hypoglycemia, particularly if triggered by a minor illness. MCADD can also present with acute liver disease and hepatomegaly, which can lead to a misdiagnosis of Reye syndrome. In some individuals, the only manifestation of MCADD is sudden, unexplained death often preceded by a minor illness that would not usually be fatal.

In areas with expanded newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), MCADD is usually detected shortly after birth, by the analysis of blood spots collected on filter paper. Acylcarnitine profiles with MS/MS will show a very characteristic pattern of elevated hexanoylcarnitine (C6), octanoylcarnitine (C8), decanoylcarnitine (C10) or decenoylcarnitine (C10:1), with C8 being greater than C6 and C10. Secondary carnitine deficiency is sometimes seen with MCADD, and in these cases, acylcarnitine profiles may not be informative. Urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) will show a pattern of dicarboxylic aciduria with low levels of ketones. Traces of acylglycine species may also be detected. Asymptomatic individuals may have normal biochemical lab results. For these individuals, targeted analysis of acylglycine species by GC-MS, specifically hexanoylglycine and suberylglycine can be diagnostic. After biochemical suspicion of MCADD, molecular genetic analysis of &quot;ACADM&quot; can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The analysis of MCAD activity in cultured fibroblasts can also be used for diagnosis.

In cases of sudden death where the preceding illness would not usually have been fatal, MCADD is often suspected. The autopsy will often show fatty deposits in the liver. In cases where MCADD is suspected, acylcarnitine analysis of bile and blood can be undertaken postmortem for diagnosis. Where samples are not available, residual blood from newborn screening may be helpful. Biochemical testing of asymptomatic siblings and parents may also be informative. MCADD and other fatty acid oxidation disorders have been recognized in recent years as undiagnosed causes of sudden infant death syndrome.

==Treatment==
As with most other fatty acid oxidation disorders, individuals with MCADD need to avoid fasting for prolonged periods of time. During illnesses, they require careful management to stave off metabolic decompensation, which can result in death. Supplementation of simple carbohydrates or glucose during illness is key to prevent catabolism. The duration of fasting for individuals with MCADD varies with age, infants typically require frequent feedings or a slow release source of carbohydrates, such as uncooked cornstarch. Illnesses and other stresses can significantly reduce the fasting tolerance of affected individuals.

Individuals with MCADD should have an &quot;emergency letter&quot; that allows medical staff who are unfamiliar with the patient and the condition to administer correct treatment properly in the event of acute decompensation. This letter should outline the steps needed to intervene in a crisis and have contact information for specialists familiar with the individual&#x27;s care.

Misdiagnosis issues
* The MCADD disorder is commonly mistaken for Reye Syndrome by pediatricians. Reye Syndrome is a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu.
* Most cases of Reye Syndrome are associated with the use of Aspirin during these viral infections.

== Prognosis ==
A 1994 study of the entire population of New South Wales (Australia) found 20 patients. Of these, 5 (25%) had died at or before 30 months of age. Of the survivors, 1 (5%) was severely disabled and the remainder had either suffered mild disability or were making normal progress in school. A 2006 Dutch study followed 155 cases and found that 27 individuals (17%) had died at an early age. Of the survivors, 24 (19%) suffered from some degree of disability, of which most were mild. All the 18 patients diagnosed neonatally were alive at the time of the follow-up.

==Incidence==
MCADD is most prevalent in individuals of Northern European Caucasian descent. The incidence in Northern Germany is 1:4000, currently the highest in the world. Northern Europe is also the origin of the common mutation in MCADD. For populations without origins in Northern Europe, the incidence is significantly lower, 1:51,000 in Japan and 1:700,000 in Taiwan. The common mutation has not been identified in MCADD cases identified in Asian populations.

<text>Dark Tranquillity is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Gothenburg. They are considered one of the pioneering acts of the Gothenburg metal scene, which also includes bands such as In Flames and At the Gates - regarded as the Gothenburg fathers in the film entitled &quot;Out of Nothing: A DT Documentary&quot; released by Century Media, which was filmed in their home town in April 2009. After a nearly three-decade long collaboration of four founding members frequent lineup changes between 2016 and 2021 have left only vocalist Mikael Stanne as an original member, together with long-time keyboardist Martin Brändström.

== History ==

=== Early years and &quot;Skydancer&quot; (1989–1993) ===
Dark Tranquillity was formed in 1989 by current vocalist and then-guitarist Mikael Stanne, and guitarist Niklas Sundin, under the name Septic Broiler. Three additional members, Anders Fridén, Anders Jivarp and Martin Henriksson, later joined the line-up.

In 1990, the band recorded a demo entitled &quot;Enfeebled Earth&quot;, which featured a largely thrash metal-influenced style of death metal, comparable to early Death. After releasing another demo entitled &quot;Rehearsal December 1990&quot;, the band changed its name to Dark Tranquillity, and released multiple demos, including &quot;Trail of Life Decayed&quot; in 1991 and &quot;A Moonclad Reflection&quot; in 1992, which both showed a progression into the more melodic nuances of death metal that the band would explore on their later studio releases.

In August 1993, the band released their debut album &quot;Skydancer&quot;. Soon after, vocalist Anders Fridén left the band and joined fellow Gothenburg band, In Flames. Guitarist Mikael Stanne then assumed the position of lead vocalist, and Fredrik Johansson was recruited to take over second guitar duties.

=== &quot;The Gallery&quot; and &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; (1994–1998) ===
In 1994, Dark Tranquillity covered the song &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot; for the Metallica tribute album &quot;Metal Militia − A Tribute to Metallica&quot;.

In 1995, the band released an EP, &quot;Of Chaos and Eternal Night&quot;, which was later followed by the release of their second studio album, &quot;The Gallery&quot;. &quot;The Gallery&quot; has been referred to as a masterpiece from the era.

Dark Tranquillity released their second EP, &quot;Enter Suicidal Angels&quot;, in November 1996. Their third album, &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot;, was released in April 1997, with the band continuing further with the sound conveyed on &quot;The Gallery&quot;.

=== &quot;Projector&quot; and &quot;Haven&quot; (1999–2000) ===
In January 1999, Fredrik Johansson and the band parted ways, citing a desire to focus on his family and a more stable job. With that position now vacant, bassist Martin Henriksson took over duties as second guitarist, and the band brought in Michael Niklasson on bass. Projector saw the introduction of a lot of piano, keyboard, and electronic parts into Dark Tranquillity&#x27;s sound, so the band also added another member, Martin Brändström, on keyboards. 

&quot;Projector&quot; was released in June 1999, and was later nominated for a Swedish Grammy Award. The album saw a major change in songwriting: while retaining growled vocals and their signature death metal sound, the band added pianos, baritone soft vocals, and verse-chorus fashion to their sound, reflecting the band&#x27;s goal to strive for different musical expressions. Around the same time, &quot;Skydancer&quot; and &quot;Of Chaos and Eternal Night&quot; were reissued together as &quot;Skydancer/Of Chaos and Eternal Night&quot;.

A year later saw the release of &quot;Haven&quot;, which featured prominent electronics in comparison to previous releases. Like its predecessor, &quot;Haven&quot; was also received in a generally mixed manner by fans and critics alike. As the band toured in 2001, the band hired Robin Engström to play live, due to Jivarp&#x27;s commitments as a new father.

=== &quot;Damage Done&quot; and &quot;Character&quot; (2001–2005) ===
Dark Tranquillity released &quot;Damage Done&quot; in 2002, was a return to a much heavier direction, adding thicker guitar distortion, deep atmospheric keyboards, and abandoning soft vocals altogether. They released the music video for the single &quot;Monochromatic Stains&quot;, followed by their release of &quot;Live Damage&quot;, their first live DVD. In 2004, their compilation album &quot;Exposures – In Retrospect and Denial&quot;, featuring one disc with rare and unreleased tracks and another with live tracks, was released.

&quot;Character&quot; was the seventh release from Dark Tranquillity, released in 2005, and was held in much critical praise. It featured the fourth music video released by Dark Tranquillity, with the successful single &quot;Lost to Apathy&quot;. After releasing the album, the band played live in Canada for the first time.

=== &quot;Fiction&quot; (2006–2009) ===

In 2007, &quot;Fiction&quot; was released, which in turn, saw a return of Stanne&#x27;s clean vocals, and the first female guest vocalist since &quot;Projector&quot;. The album also saw writing style that combined the stylings of &quot;Projector&quot; and &quot;Haven&quot;, with the more aggressive traits of &quot;Character&quot; and &quot;Damage Done&quot;. At this time, Dark Tranquillity toured with The Haunted, Into Eternity, and Scar Symmetry for the North America Metal for the Masses Tour. They also toured the UK in early 2008 along with Omnium Gatherum. They returned to the US during spring 2008 with Arch Enemy. On the band&#x27;s official website they announced that bass guitarist Niklasson left the band in August 2008 for personal reasons with no hard feelings between him and the band. On 19 September 2008, the band found a new bassist in Dimension Zero guitarist Daniel Antonsson, who also was a guitarist for Soilwork. On 25 May 2009, reissues of &quot;Projector&quot;, &quot;Haven&quot;, and &quot;Damage Done&quot; were released.

=== &quot;We Are the Void&quot; (2010–2011) ===
On 14 October 2009, Dark Tranquillity finished work on their ninth studio album. On 26 October 2009, they released a DVD titled &quot;Where Death Is Most Alive&quot;. On 30 October 2009, at the release party of the DVD, 333 copies were given away for free of the rare live album &quot;The Dying Fragments&quot;. On 21 December 2009, Dark Tranquillity released the song &quot;Dream Oblivion&quot;, and on 14 January 2010, they released the song &quot;At the Point of Ignition&quot;, from their ninth album, exclusively on their MySpace page. Their ninth album, titled &quot;We Are the Void&quot;, was released on 1 March 2010 in Europe and 2 March in the US. They were also the opening act for a US winter tour that was headlined by Killswitch Engage and joined by The Devil Wears Prada.

Dark Tranquillity headlined a North American tour in May–June 2010 with Threat Signal, Mutiny Within and The Absence. In February 2011, the band performed live at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus in Hyderabad, India.

=== &quot;Construct&quot; (2012–2013) ===
On 27 April 2012, Dark Tranquillity renewed their contract with Century Media. On 18 October 2012, the band began writing for the album. On 10 January 2013, the band announced the title of their tenth album would be &quot;Construct&quot;, and it was released in Europe on 27 May 2013 and in North America on 28 May 2013. The album was mixed by Jens Bogren at his Fascination Street studios in Örebro, Sweden.

On 18 February 2013, Antonsson amicably left Dark Tranquillity, citing a desire to focus on playing guitar and being a recording engineer and producer. On 27 February 2013, the band announced that they completed recording the album. Although Antonsson remained during the recording of &quot;Construct&quot;, he did not perform the bass. According to Niklas Sundin&#x27;s Twitter, he hasn&#x27;t been excited for a Dark Tranquillity release since &quot;Skydancer&quot;, due to the fact that the recording sessions for all their other releases were &quot;way too long&quot; compared to &quot;Construct&quot;.

On 27 March 2013, a teaser campaign and track list for &quot;Construct&quot; were revealed. The band also commented on the style of the album, saying, &quot;While still bearing the unmistakable mark of the Dark Tranquillity, the record is probably our most different and diverse offering since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Projector&quot;&quot;.

To promote the album, the band toured the world with dates in Finland and North America alongside Omnium Gatherum, Europe with Tristania, and Sweden with Darkane.

On 10 July 2013, a B-side from &quot;Construct&quot;, titled &quot;Sorrow&#x27;s Architect&quot;, was released on a limited flexi 7&quot; released with an issue of &quot;Decibel&quot;. On 14 January 2014, the band announced that the song would be released with another B-side, titled &quot;A Memory Construct&quot;, on a limited tour 7&quot; and digitally which also includes the &quot;Sorrow&#x27;s Architect&quot;. The 7&quot; became available on 1 February 2014, and digitally in March 2014.

=== &quot;Atoma&quot; (2014–2018) ===

In March 2016, guitarist Martin Henriksson announced his departure from the band, admitting he had &quot;lost the passion for playing music&quot; after playing in the band for 26 years. The band had no hard feelings for him and wished him the best in whatever he decided to pursue. 

On 22 May 2016, Dark Tranquillity began recording their eleventh full-length album &quot;Atoma&quot;, but did not officially announce it until 6 July. The album was finally released on 4 November 2016, via Century Media. In March 2017, the band released the song &quot;The Absolute&quot;, which was recorded during the Atoma sessions, as a digital single. On 28 January 2018, Dark Tranquillity embarked on a European tour with main support band Equilibrium.

=== &quot;Moment&quot; and &quot;Endtime Signals&quot; (2019–present) ===
On 22 March 2020, Niklas Sundin released a statement on Dark Tranquillity&#x27;s social media, announcing his departure from the band.

A week later, the band announced that the recording of their new album had started, and that the two guitarists who had been touring with the band, since 2017, Christopher Amott and Johan Reinholdz were named full-time members of the band. The album, &quot;Moment&quot;, was released on 20 November 2020. As a preview, they released the singles &quot;Phantom Days&quot;, &quot;Identical to None&quot;, &quot;The Dark Unbroken&quot; and &quot;Eyes Of The World&quot; on 11 September, 16 October, 30 October and on 20 November 2020, respectively. &quot;Moment&quot; was awarded the 2021 Grammi for Hard Rock/Metal Album of the Year.

On 13 August 2021, Mikael Stanne announced the departure of original drummer Anders Jivarp and bassist Anders Iwers, leaving him as only founding member of the band. For their upcoming tour bassist Christian Jansson and In Mourning drummer Joakim Strandberg Nilsson were asked to play as session musicians. Both Jansson and Strandberg Nilsson were announced as full-time band members in June 2023.

On 25 January 2022, former guitarist Fredrik Johansson died of cancer. On 23 July 2023, Christopher Amott announced his departure from the band. On 7 March 2024, the band released new song titled &quot;The Last Imagination&quot; and announced their thirteenth album titled &quot;Endtime Signals&quot;, which was released on 16 August 2024.

<doc id="552581" wikidata="Q16706151" url="?curid=552581" title="Return type">
<text>In computer programming, the return type (or result type) defines and constrains the data type of the value returned from a subroutine or method. In many programming languages (especially statically-typed programming languages such as C, C++, Java) the return type must be explicitly specified when declaring a function.

In the Java example:
public void setShuma(int n1, int n2) {
 Shuma = n1 + n2

public int getShuma() {
 return Shuma;


the return type is . The program can therefore rely on the method returning a value of type . Various mechanisms are used for the case where a subroutine does not return any value, e.g., a return type of is used in some programming languages:

public void returnNothing()

==Returning a value from a method==

A method returns to the code that invoked it when it completes all the statements in the method, reaches a return statement, or
throws an exception, whichever occurs first.

You declare a method&#x27;s return type in its method declaration. Within the body of the method, you use the return statement to return the value.

Any method declared void doesn&#x27;t return a value. It does not need to contain a return statement, but it may do so. In such a case, a return statement can be used to branch out of a control flow block and exit the method and is simply used like this:

return;

If you try to return a value from a method that is declared void, you will get a compiler error.

Any method that is not declared void must contain a return statement with a corresponding return value, like this:

return returnValue;

The data type of the return value must match the method&#x27;s declared return type; you can&#x27;t return an integer value from a method declared to return a boolean.

The getArea() method in the Rectangle Rectangle class that was discussed in the sections on objects returns an integer:

 // A method for computing the area of the rectangle
 public int getArea() {
 return width * height;

This method returns the integer that the expression evaluates to.

The getArea method returns a primitive type. A method can also return a reference type. For example, in a program to manipulate Bicycle objects, we might have a method like this:

 public Bicycle seeWhosFastest(Bicycle myBike, Bicycle yourBike,
 Environment env) {
 Bicycle fastest;
 // Code to calculate which bike is 
 // faster, given each bike&#x27;s gear 
 // and cadence and given the 
 // environment (terrain and wind)
 return fastest;

<doc id="552584" wikidata="Q2744292" url="?curid=552584" title="Rusty Cage">
<text>&quot;Rusty Cage&quot; is a song by the American rock band Soundgarden. Written by frontman Chris Cornell, &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was released in 1992 as the third single from the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; (1991). The song became an instant hit and was released as a single in several different formats. The song was included on Soundgarden&#x27;s 1997 greatest hits album, &quot;A-Sides&quot; and the 2010 compilation album &quot;Telephantasm.&quot;

==Origin and recording==
&quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was written by frontman Chris Cornell. Guitarist Kim Thayil on the song:
The tuning on that song was pretty nutty. It&#x27;s recorded with a wah wah in the low position used as a filter. That was the first time we did anything like that. It was Chris&#x27;s idea; he wanted to get that weird tone that you can&#x27;t really dial in on an amp. But if you use the wah wah as a filter, it gets an incredibly weird sound. And if you listen to that riff, especially if you&#x27;ve heard the original demos of it, it almost sounds backward.

==Composition==
On &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; the bottom E string is tuned all the way down to B, with Thayil stating that &quot;the string was all wobbly but it had a good effect&quot;. The song features a striking tempo change towards the end of the song. The phrasing and meter also change: the first part of the song is in 4/4 but the second, slower, part is in an irregular, recurring metric pattern containing nineteen beats that could be interpreted various ways: either as 4 bars of 3/4 followed by one bar of 2/4, followed by a bar of 3/4 and a bar of 2/4 (3+3+3+3+2+3+2), or as 3+3+3+5+5, or even as one long bar of 19/4 or 19/8. Thayil has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it, and said that the use of odd meters was &quot;a total accident&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was released as a single in 1992 in various versions with a previously unreleased B-side titled &quot;Touch Me&quot;. Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The song gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations.

In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song number nine on their list of the 15 greatest Soundgarden songs, and in 2021, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number eight on their list of the 20 greatest Soundgarden songs.

&quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was part of the soundtrack of the 1994 bike racing game, &quot;Road Rash&quot;, which received 3DO&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Soundtrack of the Year&quot; award. The song appeared on the fictional radio station &quot;Radio X&quot; in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. However, these versions are all 1 minute and 43 seconds shorter than the album version. The majority of these versions end as the breakdown at the end of the song comes in. It is also featured in the 2008 racing game, &quot;Burnout Paradise&quot;, where the full version is intact. The song is a part of Soundgarden&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Telephantasm&quot; DLC Pack for &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;. The song was added to the &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; downloadable content catalog on July 19, 2011. The Johnny Cash version also appears in the Mob of the Dead zombies map in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;&#x27;s Uprising downloadable content. Like previous songs in the Call of Duty series&#x27; DLC, it is triggered by activating objects in the environment. It also appeared on the official trailer for Prey 2, which was later cancelled. Toyota also used the song for the 2014 Corolla advertisement.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was directed by Eric Zimmerman, who had previously directed the &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; music video for the band. The video features Soundgarden performing the song in a white room amid scenes of the band members being chased through a forest by dogs, farmers, and a man in a truck. The video was released in March 1992. It gained considerable airtime on MTV.

==Live performances==
A performance of &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; can be found on the &quot;Motorvision&quot; home video release.

&quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was covered by Johnny Cash on the 1996 album, &quot;Unchained&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Country Album, and Cash&#x27;s version earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. During at least three live performances by Soundgarden (July 21, 1996, in Knoxville, Tennessee, at Forks In The River, early November 1996 at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois, and at Soundgarden&#x27;s last pre-breakup show at the Blaisdell Arena, Honolulu, Hawaii, on February 9, 1997), Cornell introduced the song with a dedication to Cash. On Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Higher Truth&quot; acoustic tour in late 2015, he started including &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; in the set-list, employing Cash&#x27;s country-rock arrangement of the song.

<doc id="552586" wikidata="Q345641" url="?curid=552586" title="Bernard Williams">
<text>Sir Bernard Arthur Owen Williams (21 September 1929 – 10 June 2003) was an English moral philosopher. His publications include &quot;Problems of the Self&quot; (1973), &quot;Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy&quot; (1985), &quot;Shame and Necessity&quot; (1993), and &quot;Truth and Truthfulness&quot; (2002). He was knighted in 1999.

As Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, Williams became known for his efforts to reorient the study of moral philosophy to psychology, history, and in particular to the Greeks. Described by Colin McGinn as an &quot;analytical philosopher with the soul of a general humanist,&quot; he was sceptical about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he demanded of philosophy that it &quot;come to terms with, and contain, the difficulty and complexity of human life.&quot;

Williams was a strong supporter of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was &quot;as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be.&quot; He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams&#x27;s mentors at Oxford, said that he &quot;understands what you&#x27;re going to say better than you understand it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you&#x27;ve got to the end of your own sentence.&quot;

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Williams was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, a suburb of Southend, Essex, to Hilda Amy Williams, née Day, a personal assistant, and Owen Pasley Denny Williams, chief maintenance surveyor for the Ministry of Works. He was educated at Chigwell School, an independent school, where he first discovered philosophy. Reading D. H. Lawrence led him to ethics and the problems of the self. In his first book, &quot;Morality: An Introduction to Ethics&quot; (1972), he quoted with approval Lawrence&#x27;s advice to &quot;[f]ind your deepest impulse, and follow that.&quot;

Awarded a scholarship to Oxford, Williams read Greats (pure Classics followed by Ancient History and philosophy) at Balliol. Among his influences at Oxford were W. S. Watt, Russell Meiggs, R. M. Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David Pears and Gilbert Ryle. He shone in the first part of the course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first in the second part of the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.

After Oxford, Williams spent his two-year national service flying Spitfires in Canada for the Royal Air Force. While on leave in New York, he became close to Shirley Brittain Catlin (born 1930), daughter of the novelist Vera Brittain and the political scientist George Catlin. They had already been friends at Oxford. Catlin had moved to New York to study economics at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship.

Williams returned to England to take up his fellowship at All Souls and in 1954 became a fellow at New College, Oxford, a position he held until 1959. He and Catlin continued seeing each other. She began working for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and sought election as a Labour MP. Williams, also a member of the Labour Party, helped her with the 1954 by-election in Harwich in which she was an unsuccessful candidate.

===First marriage, London===

Bernard Williams and Shirley Catlin were married in London in July 1955 at St James&#x27;s, Spanish Place, near Marylebone High Street, followed by a honeymoon in Lesbos, Greece.

The couple moved into a very basic ground-floor apartment in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given how hard it was to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for £6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.

In 1958, Williams spent a term teaching at the University of Ghana in Legon. When he returned to England in 1959, he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at University College London. In 1961, after four miscarriages in four years, Shirley Williams gave birth to their daughter, Rebecca.

Williams was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1963, and was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Bedford College, London, in 1964. His wife was elected to parliament that year as the Labour member for Hitchin in Hertfordshire. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described the couple two years later as &quot;the New Left at its most able, most generous, and sometimes most eccentric.&quot; Andy Beckett wrote that they &quot;entertained refugees from eastern Europe and politicians from Africa, and drank sherry in noteworthy quantities.&quot; Shirley Williams became a junior minister and, in 1971, Shadow Home Secretary. Several newspapers saw her as a future prime minister. She went on to co-found a new centrist party in 1981, the Social Democratic Party; Williams left the Labour Party to join the SDP, although he later returned to Labour.

===Cambridge, second marriage===

In 1967, at the age of 38, Williams became the Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of King&#x27;s College.

According to Jane O&#x27;Grady, Williams was central to the decision by King&#x27;s in 1972 to admit women, one of the first three all-male Oxbridge undergraduate colleges to do so. In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time. In the 1970s, when Nussbaum&#x27;s thesis supervisor, G. E. L. Owen, was harassing female students, and she decided nevertheless to support him, Williams told her, during a walk along the backs at Cambridge: &quot;[Y]ou know, there is a price you are paying for this support and encouragement. Your dignity is being held hostage. You really don&#x27;t have to put up with this.&quot;

Shirley Williams&#x27;s political career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) meant that the couple spent a lot of time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with south Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values – he was an atheist, she a Catholic – placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for &quot;Utilitarianism: For and Against&quot; with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.

Williams and Skinner began living together in 1971. He obtained a divorce in 1974 (at Shirley Williams&#x27; request, the marriage was later annulled). Patricia Skinner married him that year, and the couple went on to have two sons, Jacob in 1975 and Jonathan in 1980. Shirley Williams married the political scientist Richard Neustadt in 1987.

===Berkeley and Oxford===

In 1979 Williams was elected Provost of King&#x27;s, a position he held until 1987. He spent a semester in 1986 at the University of California, Berkeley as Mills Visiting Professor and in 1988 left England to become Monroe Deutsch Professor of Philosophy there, announcing to the media that he was leaving as part of the &quot;brain drain&quot; of British academics to America. He was also Sather Professor of Classical Literature at Berkeley in 1989; &quot;Shame and Necessity&quot; (1995) grew out of his six Sather lectures.

Williams returned to England in 1990 as White&#x27;s Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford and fellow of Corpus Christi. His sons had been &quot;at sea&quot; in California, he said, not knowing what was expected of them, and he had been unable to help. He regretted having made his departure from England so public; he had been persuaded to do so to highlight Britain&#x27;s relatively low academic salaries. When he retired in 1996, he took up a fellowship again at All Souls.

===Royal commissions, committees===

Williams served on several royal commissions and government committees: the Public Schools Commission (1965–1970), drug abuse (1971), gambling (1976–1978), the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship (1979), and the Commission on Social Justice (1993–1994). &quot;I did all the major vices,&quot; he said. While on the gambling commission, one of his recommendations, ignored at the time, was for a national lottery. (John Major&#x27;s government introduced one in 1994.)

Mary Warnock described Williams&#x27;s report on pornography in 1979, as chair of the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship, as &quot;agreeable, actually compulsive to read.&quot; It relied on a &quot;harm condition&quot; that &quot;no conduct should be suppressed by law unless it can be shown to harm someone,&quot; and concluded that so long as children were protected from pornography, adults should be free to read and watch it as they see fit. The report rejected the view that pornography tends to cause sexual offences. Two cases in particular were highlighted, the Moors Murders and the Cambridge Rapist, where the influence of pornography had been discussed during the trials. The report argued that both cases appeared to be &quot;more consistent with pre-existing traits being reflected both in a choice of reading matter and in the acts committed against others.&quot;

===Opera===
Williams enjoyed opera from an early age, particularly Mozart and Wagner. Patricia Williams writes that he attended performances of the Carl Rosa Company and Sadler&#x27;s Wells as a teenager. In an essay on Wagner, he described having been reduced to a &quot;virtually uncontrollable state&quot; during a performance by Jon Vickers as Tristan at Covent Garden. He served on the board of the English National Opera from 1968 to 1986, and wrote an entry, &quot;The Nature of Opera,&quot; for &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;. A collection of his essays, &quot;On Opera&quot;, was published posthumously in 2006, edited by Patricia Williams.

===Honours and death===
Williams became a member of the Institut international de philosophie in 1969, a fellow of the British Academy in 1971 and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983. The following year he was made a syndic of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and later the chair. In 1993 he was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society of Arts, and in 1999 he was knighted. Several universities awarded him honorary doctorates, including Yale and Harvard.

Williams died of heart failure on 10 June 2003 while on holiday in Rome; he had been diagnosed in 1999 with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. He was survived by his wife, their two sons, and his first child, Rebecca. He was cremated in Rome.

==Writing==
===Approach to ethics===
A. W. Moore writes that Williams&#x27; work lies within the analytic tradition, although less typical of it &quot;in its breadth, in its erudition, and above all in its profound humanity&quot;:

Although he was never a vigorous apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work is a model of all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.

Williams did not produce any ethical theory or system; several commentators noted, unfairly in the view of his supporters, that he was largely a critic. Moore writes that Williams was unaffected by this criticism: &quot;He simply refused to allow philosophical system-building to eclipse the subtlety and variety of human ethical experience.&quot; He equated ethical theories with &quot;a tidiness, a systematicity, and an economy of ideas,&quot; writes Moore, that were not up to describing human lives and motives. Williams tried not to lose touch &quot;with the real concerns that animate our ordinary ethical experience,&quot; unlike much of the &quot;arid, ahistorical, second-order&quot; debates about ethics in philosophy departments.

In his first book, &quot;Morality: An Introduction to Ethics&quot; (1972), Williams wrote that whereas &quot;most moral philosophy at most times has been empty and boring ... [c]ontemporary moral philosophy has found an original way of being boring, which is by not discussing moral issues at all.&quot; He argued that the study of ethics should be vital, compelling and difficult, and he sought an approach that was accountable to psychology and history.

Williams was not an ethical realist, holding that unlike scientific knowledge, which can approach an &quot;absolute conception of reality,&quot; an ethical judgment rests on a point of view. He argued that the &quot;thick&quot; ethical concepts, such as kindness and cruelty, express a &quot;union of fact and value.&quot; The idea that our values are not &quot;in the world&quot; was liberating: &quot;[A] radical form of freedom may be found in the fact that we cannot be forced by the world to accept one set of values rather than another&quot; said Williams.

Williams frequently emphasised what he saw as the ways in which luck pervades ethical life. He coined and developed the term moral luck, and illustrated the idea of moral luck via a number of enormously influential examples. One of Williams&#x27;s famous examples of moral luck concerns the painter Paul Gauguin&#x27;s decision to move to Tahiti.

===Critique of Kant===

Williams&#x27;s work throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in &quot;Morality: An Introduction to Ethics&quot; (1972), &quot;Problems of the Self&quot; (1973), &quot;Utilitarianism: For and Against&quot; with J. J. C. Smart (1973), &quot;Moral Luck&quot; (1981) and &quot;Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy&quot; (1985), outlined his attacks on the twin pillars of ethics: utilitarianism and the moral philosophy of the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Martha Nussbaum wrote that his work &quot;denounced the trivial and evasive way in which moral philosophy was being practised in England under the aegis of those two dominant theories.&quot; &quot;Both theories simplified the moral life,&quot; she wrote, &quot;neglecting emotions and personal attachments and how sheer luck shapes our choices.&quot; (Williams said in 1996: &quot;Roughly, if it isn&#x27;t about obligation or consequences, it doesn&#x27;t count.&quot;)

Kant&#x27;s &quot;Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten&quot; (1785) expounded a moral system based on the categorical imperative, one formulation of which is: &quot;Act only according to that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.&quot; Rational agents must act on &quot;principles of pure rational agency,&quot; writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and &quot;what it takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth,&quot; writes Moore. But one can &quot;act&quot; rationally by satisfying one&#x27;s own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant&#x27;s approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.

Williams argued that Kant had given the &quot;purest, deepest and most thorough representation of morality,&quot; but that the &quot;honourable instincts of Kantianism to defend the individuality of individuals against the agglomerative indifference of Utilitarianism&quot; may not be effective against the Kantian &quot;abstract character of persons as moral agents.&quot; We should not be expected to act as though we are not who we are in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.

===Critique of utilitarianism===

Williams set out the case against utilitarianism – a consequentialist position the simplest version of which is that actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number – in &quot;Utilitarianism: For and Against&quot; (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book&#x27;s thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim&#x27;s status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.

Williams argued that there is a crucial distinction between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim&#x27;s. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect &quot;Jim&quot; is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.

===Reasons for action===

Williams argued that there are only internal reasons for action: &quot;A has a reason to φ if A has some desire the satisfaction of which will be served by his φ-ing.&quot; An external reason would be &quot;A has reason to φ,&quot; even if nothing in A&#x27;s &quot;subjective motivational set&quot; would be furthered by her φ-ing. Williams argued that it is meaningless to say that there are external reasons; reason alone does not move people to action.

Sophie-Grace Chappell argues that, without external reasons for action, it becomes impossible to maintain that the same set of moral reasons applies to all agents equally. In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing to do it, because internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, &quot;involves treating the person who is blamed like someone who had a reason to do the right thing but did not do it.&quot;

===Truth===
In his final completed book, &quot;Truth and Truthfulness: An Essay in Genealogy&quot; (2002), Williams identifies the two basic values of truth as accuracy and sincerity, and tries to address the gulf between the demand for truth and the doubt that any such thing exists. Jane O&#x27;Grady wrote in a &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary of Williams that the book is an examination of those who &quot;sneer at any purported truth as ludicrously naive because it is, inevitably, distorted by power, class bias and ideology.&quot;

The debt to Friedrich Nietzsche is clear, most obviously in the adoption of a genealogical method as a tool of explanation and critique. Although part of Williams&#x27;s intention was to attack those he felt denied the value of truth, the book cautions that, to understand it simply in that sense, would be to miss part of its purpose; rather, as Kenneth Baker wrote, it is &quot;Williams&#x27; reflection on the moral cost of the intellectual vogue for dispensing with the concept of truth.&quot;

==Legacy==
Williams did not propose any systematic philosophical theory; indeed, he was suspicious of any such attempt. He became known for his dialectical powers, although he was suspicious of them too. Alan Code wrote that Williams had never been &quot;impressed by the display of mere dialectical cleverness, least of all in moral philosophy&quot;:

On the contrary, one of the most notable features of his philosophical outlook was an unwavering insistence on a series of points that may seem obvious but which are nevertheless all-too-frequently neglected: that moral or ethical thought is part of human life; that in writing about it, philosophers are writing about something of genuine importance; that it is not easy to say anything worth saying about the subject; that what moral philosophers write is answerable to the realities of human history, psychology, and social affairs; and that mere cleverness is indeed not the relevant measure of value.&quot;
In 1996 Martin Hollis said that Williams had &quot;a good claim to be the leading British philosopher of his day,&quot; but that, although he had a &quot;lovely eye for the central questions,&quot; he had none of the answers. Alan Thomas identified Williams&#x27;s contribution to ethics as an overarching scepticism about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy, explicitly articulated in &quot;Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy&quot; (1985) and &quot;Shame and Necessity&quot; (1993), in which he argued that moral theories can never reflect the complexities of life, particularly given the radical pluralism of modern societies.

Learning to be yourself, to be authentic and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams&#x27;s work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. &quot;If there&#x27;s one theme in all my work it&#x27;s about authenticity and self-expression,&quot; Williams said in 2002. &quot;It&#x27;s the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren&#x27;t ... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity.&quot; He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, &quot;What is my duty?&quot;, and back to the issue that mattered to the Greeks: &quot;How should we live?&quot;

<text>Jean Ribault (also spelled &quot;Ribaut&quot;) (1520 – October 12, 1565) was a French naval officer, navigator, and a colonizer of what would become the southeastern United States. He was a major figure in the French attempts to colonize Florida. A Huguenot and officer under Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, Ribault led an expedition to the New World in 1562 that founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island in present-day South Carolina. Two years later, he took over command of the French colony of Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. He and many of his followers died at the hands of Spanish soldiers during the Massacre at Matanzas Inlet, near St. Augustine.

== Biography ==
===Early life and first co was born in the town of Dieppe in Normandy in 1520. He entered the French navy under the command of the Huguenot admiral Gaspard de Coligny. In 1562 Coligny chose him to lead an expedition to the New World to found a colony. Ribault left France on February 18 with a fleet of 150 colonists. A recently discovered document suggests that they were guided to Florida by Portuguese pilot Bartolomeu Borges. After crossing the Atlantic, they explored the mouth of the St. Johns River in modern-day Jacksonville, Florida. He named it the &quot;River May&quot;, as this was the month when he found it, and erected a stone column claiming the territory for France. Ribault&#x27;s fleet then proceeded north, charting more of the coastline and noting several rivers. Eventually, they came to the Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina, and Ribault elected to establish a settlement on Parris Island, one of the Sea Islands off the coast. Ribault oversaw the layout of a small fort, which was named Charlesfort in honor of the French king Charles IX. Ribault left 27 men under the command of Albert de la Pierria to man the fort and soon set sail for France.

Ribault&#x27;s intention was to collect supplies for Charlesfort and return by the end of the year. When he arrived at Le Havre, however, he discovered the French Wars of Religion had broken out between the Catholic majority and the Protestant Huguenots. Ribault assisted the Huguenots at Dieppe but was forced to flee to England when the city fell. While in England, he managed to gain an audience with Queen Elizabeth I and organized some backers for a plan to settle in America. However, despite this cordial welcome, he was soon arrested and detained in the Tower of London as a spy. During his time in England, and probably while imprisoned, Ribault wrote an account of the voyage, which survives only in English translation.

The 1563 Peace of Amboise finally allowed Coligny to devote attention for a new voyage to North America. He appointed Ribault&#x27;s former lieutenant, René Goulaine de Laudonnière, to replace Ribault in the North American endeavors. During this time, however, Charlesfort had fallen into despair. A fire destroyed most of the settlement&#x27;s meager stores. Captain Albert de la Pierria&#x27;s heavy discipline led the soldiers to a mutiny in which he was deposed and killed. Afterward, the survivors elected to build a crude vessel and attempt to sail back to France. The trip was arduous, and most of the participants died before they finally reached the English coast, where they were rescued. News of this reached France just before Laudonnière had embarked on his voyage.

===Second voyage===
Laudonnière ultimately set sail on April 22, 1564 and arrived at Florida two months later. The plan for Ribault was to follow him in Spring 1565 with reinforcements and fresh supplies. As Charlesfort was now abandoned, the expedition decided to found a new colony on the banks of the St. Johns River, the same area Ribault and company had explored on the prior voyage. They christened the settlement Fort Caroline.

Fort Caroline sustained itself for the next year, but Ribault found himself caught up in the fresh outbreak of war in France and was unable to set sail at the appointed time. As a result, the colony experienced food shortages and deteriorating conditions, and some soldiers mutinied and became pirates, attacking Spanish vessels in the Caribbean. The situation was exacerbated by a clash with the Utina, a Timucua Indian tribe up the river to the south. Ribault finally organized his fleet in the summer of 1565, ultimately departing from France with 800 new settlers and five ships. He arrived in Florida on August 28, just as the despairing Laudonnière was preparing to sail home. Ribault promptly relieved Laudonnière as governor and assumed command of Fort Caroline.

In the meantime, the Spanish, who had long maintained a claim over Florida, had made preparations to find and oust the French from Fort Caroline. In early September Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, newly-appointed &quot;adelantado&quot; of Florida, encountered Ribault&#x27;s ships at anchor off the River of May. After a brief naval skirmish, the French ships cut their anchor lines and fled, and Menéndez retreated to the next inlet to the south, landing his men on 7 September and establishing the settlement of St. Augustine.

===Disaster===
The Spanish hastily threw up palm-log and earthworks around an existing Timucua Indian village at their newly founded settlement and began unloading their ships. Before all of the equipment and supplies could be unloaded, Menéndez sent his flagship &quot;San Pelayo&quot; away to Hispaniola, as it was too big to enter the St. Augustine Inlet and Menéndez expected an attack from Ribault. Jean Ribault did attack only hours later, and almost captured Menéndez who was on a smaller vessel offshore, but the Spaniard risked crossing the sandbar at the mouth of the inlet and made it to the harbor. As the French galleons were also too large to cross the inlet, Ribault took his fleet south to pursue &quot;San Pelayo&quot; when the hurricane struck on September 11, driving his ships further south to their destruction on the Canaveral coast. 

Assuming that the majority of the French men-at-arms were on board Ribault&#x27;s ships, leaving Fort Caroline defenseless, Menéndez ordered his infantrymen to march north to Fort Caroline, during the hurricane. On 20 September, the Spanish captured the now-lightly-defended French settlement; 140 men were immediately put to death. In the eyes of the king of Spain, the Protestant religion and acts of piracy committed from Fort Caroline made the entire settlement a dangerous nest of pirates, heretics, and trespassers on Spanish territory. Only about 60 women and children were spared. René Laudonnière and about 40 others escaped the wrath of the Spaniards, and eventually returned to Europe to tell their tales.

The same hurricane that masked the approach of Menéndez&#x27;s troops on Fort Caroline, utterly destroyed all of Ribault&#x27;s fleet, driving them up on the beach many miles south of their intended target. Several hundred soldiers and sailors made it ashore barely alive and then walked from near present-day Daytona Beach to Matanzas Inlet, 14 miles south of St. Augustine. The marooned sailors were soon tracked down by Menéndez and a patrol force of Spanish troops, probably under a hundred men. Ribault, believing his hungry men would be fed and decently treated, allowed himself to be bluffed into surrender. In groups of ten, the Frenchmen were rowed across to the mainland, hands tied behind their backs. Following the explicit orders of King Philip II of Spain, the prisoners were asked if they were professing Catholics. Those who were not were marched behind a dune and put to the sword by Menéndez&#x27;s Spanish soldiers. Only a handful of Catholics, young musicians, and ship&#x27;s boys were spared their lives. A similar surrender and mass execution of a smaller group of Frenchmen followed a few days later. This time a few Frenchmen, suspicious of their enemies, preferred to take their chances with the Native Americans. Altogether, Ribault and about 350 of his officers and men lost their lives in the two massacres. The location of this event still carries today the name &quot;Matanzas&quot;, the Spanish for &quot;slaughters.&quot; Menéndez had carried out his orders to wipe out the French incursion.

In 1568 French nobleman-turned-pirate Dominique de Gourgues avenged Ribault. He and 200 men attacked Spanish-held Fort Caroline, secured the garrison&#x27;s surrender, and then put all the defenders to death.

==Legacy==
In 2018 the shipwreck of Ribault&#x27;s flagship, &quot;La Trinité&quot;, was located off of the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Several places and institutions in Jacksonville are named for Ribault, including Jean Ribault Middle School and Jean Ribault High School; the Ribault Club on Fort George Island; a tributary of the Trout River, the Ribault River; several neighborhood streets near the river; and the Mayport Ferry Service boat, the &quot;Jean Ribault.&quot; In Beaufort and adjacent Port Royal, SC, Ribaut (spelled without the &quot;l&quot;) Road is a major thoroughfare; as a segment of US 21 it passes near the Charlesfort site. Ribault was featured in the &quot;Conquest of the Southeast&quot; episode (2005) of The History Channel&#x27;s documentary miniseries &quot;Conquest of America&quot; and in the &quot;Secrets of Spanish Florida&quot; episode (2017) of the PBS/WNET program, &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot;.

<text>The Mighty Ducks (also known as D1: The Mighty Ducks, and Champions in the United Kingdom and Australia) is a 1992 American sports comedy-drama film about a youth league hockey team, directed by Stephen Herek and starring Emilio Estevez, Joss Ackland and Lane Smith. It was produced by The Kerner Entertainment Company and Avnet–Kerner Productions and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the first film in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; film series. In some countries, the home release copies were printed with the title as The Mighty Ducks Are the Champions to avoid confusion with the title of the sequel.

The year after the film&#x27;s release, Disney founded an NHL hockey team, named the &quot;Mighty Ducks of Anaheim&quot;.

==Plot==
Gordon Bombay is a successful but arrogant Minneapolis defense attorney. After his 30th successful case, he celebrates by going out drinking, but is arrested for drunk driving and sentenced to 500 hours of community service by coaching the local &quot;District 5&quot; Pee-Wee hockey team. Bombay has a checkered past with hockey: as a youth in 1973, he was the Hawks&#x27; star player but, struggling with the loss of his father, he missed a tie-breaking penalty shot in the final seconds of the championship game, sending the game to overtime in which the Hawks lost, disappointing his hyper-competitive coach, Jack Reilly.

Bombay meets the team and realizes the children have no practice facility, equipment, or ability. Their first game with Bombay at the helm is against the Hawks, with Reilly still the Hawks&#x27; head coach. District 5 is defeated, 17-0, as Reilly demands the Hawks run up the score. Bombay berates the team for not listening to him, but the players challenge his authority. For the next match, Bombay tries to teach his team how to dive and draw penalties, which results in another loss angering the team further. Specifically one player Charlie Conway, who refused to fake an injury. Bombay visits his mentor Hans, who owns a nearby sporting goods store and was in attendance at the game against the Hawks. Bombay recalls that he quit playing hockey after losing his father four months before the championship game, and because Reilly blamed him for the loss due to the missed penalty shot. Hans encourages him to rekindle his childhood passion for the sport by skating on a frozen pond like he did when he was a kid. Realizing the error of his ways, he apologizes to Charlie and his mother at their home.

Bombay convinces his boss Gerald Ducksworth to sponsor the team, allowing them to purchase proper equipment and give Bombay time to teach the players fundamentals. Renamed the Ducks after Ducksworth, the team manage a tie in their next game. They recruit three new players: Figure skating siblings Tommy and Tammy Duncan, and slap shot specialist and enforcer Fulton Reed. Bombay, seeing potential in Charlie, takes him under his wing and teaches him some of the tactics he used playing with the Hawks.

Bombay learns that, due to redistricting, the Hawks&#x27; star player Adam Banks lives in District Five and should be playing for the Ducks, and threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks. After overhearing an out-of-context quote about the team, most of the players walk out (except Charlie and Fulton who form a strong friendship), resulting in a forfeit to the Flames. The Ducks lose faith in Bombay and revert to their old habits except Charlie and Fulton. Ducksworth makes a deal with Reilly for the Hawks to keep Banks, which Bombay refuses on the principles of fair play, which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service. Left with the choice of letting his team down or being fired from his job, he takes the latter.

Bombay manages to regain his players&#x27; trust after they win a crucial match against the Huskies in order to qualify for the playoffs. Banks decides to play with the Ducks rather than not play hockey at all. The Ducks march through the playoffs, and face the Hawks in the championship game. Reilly orders his team to injure Banks to force him out of the game. In spite of this, the Ducks manage to tie the game late in the final period, and Charlie is tripped by a Hawks player as time expires. In precisely the same situation Bombay faced in his youth, Charlie prepares for a game-deciding penalty shot. In stark contrast to Reilly, Bombay tells Charlie to take his best shot and that he will believe in him no matter what. Inspired, Charlie fakes out the goalie with the &quot;triple-deke&quot; Bombay taught him and scores, winning the championship.

Several days later, Bombay boards a bus to a minor-league tryout, secured for him by the NHL&#x27;s Basil McRae of the Minnesota North Stars, who played Pee-Wee hockey with him as a youth. Although daunted at the prospect of going up against younger players, he receives the same words of encouragement and advice from the Ducks he had given them, promising to return next season to defend their title.

==Cast==
Basil McRae and Mike Modano both made cameo appearances towards the end of the movie.

==Production==
The film was written by Steve Brill, who later sued for royalties for the film. Jake Gyllenhaal turned down the role of Charlie Conway. Emilio Estevez was cast in 1991, after Herek was impressed by his performances in Brat Pack films, &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983), &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985) and &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985).

It was filmed in several locations in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Principal photography took place between January and April 1992.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $50,752,337 in the United States and Canada, becoming a surprising success with audiences. &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; made $54 million in home video rentals according to Video Week magazine in 1993.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; received underwhelming critical reviews at the time of its release. It holds a 27% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; has feel-good goals, but only scores a penalty shot for predictability&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert said the film was &quot;sweet and innocent, and that at a certain level it might appeal to younger kids. I doubt if its ambitions reach much beyond that&quot;, and gave it a 2-star rating. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as &#x27;Steven Brill, who has a small role in the film, constructed the screenplay much as one would put together some of those particleboard bookcases from Ikea.&#x27;

Emilio Estevez was surprised at the popularity of the movie series.

=== Accolades ===
American Film Institute recognition

*AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers - Nominated
*AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 - Nominated

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS on April 14, 1993, DVD on April 11, 2000, and on Blu-ray Disc on May 23, 2017.

==Sequels==
The unexpected box-office success of the film inspired two sequels, &quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1994) and &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1996), and an animated TV series (the latter taking on a science fiction angle with actual anthropomorphic ducks). While both sequels failed to match the original film&#x27;s gross, they were still financially successful.

<doc id="552593" wikidata="Q26399" url="?curid=552593" title="Hoggar Mountains">
<text>The Hoggar Mountains ( (Ǧibāl Haqqār), Berber: &quot;idurar n Ahaggar&quot;) are a highland region in the central Sahara in southern Algeria, along the Tropic of Cancer. The mountains cover an area of approximately 550,000 km2.

The Hoggar Mountains are home to the Ahaggar National Park. The tallest peak in the range and Algeria, Mount Tahat, is located in the park area, which covers approximately .

==Geography==
This mountainous region is located about south of the capital, Algiers. The area is largely rocky desert with an average elevation of more than above sea level. The highest peak, Mount Tahat, is at . The mountains are primarily composed of metamorphic rock approximately 2 billion years old, although there are areas where more recent volcanic activity has laid down much newer rock. Several of the more dramatic peaks, such as Ilamen, are the result of erosion wearing away extinct volcano domes, leaving behind the more resistant material that plugged the volcanic cones.

Assekrem is a famous and often visited point where Charles de Foucauld built a hermitage in 1911. 

The highlands are believed to be one of the main sources of the Tamanrasset River, an ancient river that flowed during the African humid period, and named after the main city near the Hoggar Mountains, Tamanrasset, built in a desert valley or wadi that was part of the ancient watercourse.

==Environment==
The Hoggar Mountains range typically experiences hot summers, with a cold winter climate. Temperatures fall below freezing in the winter. Rainfall is rare and sporadic year-round. However, since the climate is less extreme than in most other areas of the Sahara, the mountains are a major location for biodiversity, including a number of relict species. The Hoggar Mountains are part of the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion.

===Flora and fauna ===
Vegetation in this area includes trees such as &quot;Vachellia tortilis&quot;, &quot;Vachellia seyal&quot;, &quot;myrtle&quot; and &quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot; which are scattered throughout the area. Other plants may include &quot;Citrullus colocynthis&quot; and &quot;Calotropis procera&quot;.

Slightly to the west of the Hoggar range, a population of the endangered African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;) remained viable into the 20th century, but is now thought to be extirpated within this entire region. Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Hoggar Mountains until the early 20th century.

Analysis of collected scat in 2006 showed the presence of the Northwest African cheetah in the region. Between August 2008 and November 2010, four individuals were recorded by camera traps. A single cheetah was filmed and photographed by Algerian naturalists in 2020 in the national park in the Atakor volcanic field whose peaks approach a height of . The park also contains a population of herbivores such as the saharan subspecies of the barbary sheep and the Dorcas gazelle.

The park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of spotted, crowned and Lichtenstein&#x27;s Sandgrouse, Pharaoh eagle-owls, pallid harriers, greater hoopoe-larks, bar-tailed and desert larks, pale rock martins, fulvous babblers, white-crowned and mourning wheatears, desert sparrows and trumpeter finches.

==History==
Prehistoric settlement is evident from extant rock paintings dating to 6000 BC. The Hoggar Massif is the land of the Kel Ahaggar Tuareg. The tomb of Tin Hinan, the woman believed to be the matriarch of the Tuareg, is located at Abalessa, an oasis near Tamanrasset.

The hermitage of Charles de Foucauld, which continues to be inhabited by a few Catholic monks, is at the top of the Assekrem plateau in the Hoggar Mountains.

Underground atomic tests were conducted by France in the mountains in the 1960s.

<doc id="552595" wikidata="Q548470" url="?curid=552595" title="Supine">
<text>In grammar, a supine is a form of verbal noun used in some languages. The term is most often used for Latin, where it is one of the four principal parts of a verb. The word refers to a position of lying on one&#x27;s back (as opposed to &#x27;prone&#x27;, lying face downward), but there exists no widely accepted etymology that explains why or how the term came to be used to also describe this form of a verb.

==Latin==
There are two supines, I (first) and II (second). They are originally the accusative and dative or ablative forms of a verbal noun in the fourth declension, respectively. 

===First supine===
The first supine ends in &quot;-um&quot;. It has two uses. 

The first use is with verbs of motion. In many cases, it indicates purpose:

* &#x27;Mater pompam me &quot;spectatum&quot; duxit&#x27; is &#x27;Mother took me &quot;to watch&quot; the procession&#x27;.
* &#x27;Legati ad Caesarem &quot;gratulatum&quot; convenerunt&#x27; is &#x27;The ambassadors came to Caesar &quot;to congratulate&quot; him&#x27;. 

The translation of this first usage of the first supine is similar to, if not identical to, the Latin clause of purpose. 

A second usage is in combination with the future passive infinitive. In this second usage it indicates fate; for example &quot;occisum iri&quot; means &#x27;to be going to be killed&#x27;. It mostly appears in indirect statements:

* &#x27; &quot;Occisum iri&quot; a Milone video&#x27; is &#x27;I foresee that he is &quot;going to be killed&quot; by Milo&#x27;.

===Second supine===
The second supine, which comes with adjectives, is rarely used; only a few verbs have been seen to commonly adopt the form. It is derived from the dative of purpose, which expresses the purpose of a thing or action, or the ablative of respect, which can translate as &quot;with regard/respect to&quot; and is used to indicate to what extent or in what way the main clause is true. It is the same as the first supine but replacing final &quot;-um&quot; by &quot;-ū&quot;, with a lengthened &quot;u&quot;. &quot;Mirabile dictū&quot;, for example, translates as &quot;amazing to say&quot;, where &quot;dictū&quot; is the supine form. The sense is generally passive, even if usually not explicitly marked as such in idiomatic English translation; for example, &quot;difficile creditū&quot;, &quot;hard to believe&quot;, is more literally &quot;hard to be believed&quot;, or &quot;hardly believable&quot;.

==Sanskrit==
Sanskrit has a formation, from the accusative form of an old verbal noun, &quot;-tu&quot;. The ending &quot;-tum&quot;, much like in Latin, is added to the root. 

* √dā ⇒ dā́·tum − (to give)
* √bhū- ⇒ bháv·i·tum − (to be)
* √kṛ- ⇒ kár·tum − (to do)
* √gam- ⇒ gán·tum − (to go)

==Germanic languages==
In English grammar, the term &quot;supine&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive. The &quot;to&quot;-infinitive is seen in sentences like &quot;To err is human; to forgive divine.&quot;

In Swedish grammar, the supine is used with an auxiliary verb to produce some compound verb forms that closely resemble perfect forms.
Inspired by the tradition in Swedish grammar, some linguists identify a similar form in the Danish language.

In Icelandic grammar, &quot;sagnbót&quot; (usually translated as &quot;supine&quot;) is a verbal form identical to the neuter participle, used to form certain verb tenses.

==Finnic languages==
In Estonian, the supine is called &quot;ma-tegevusnimi&quot; (lit. &quot;ma-infinitive&quot;) because all the words in supine have &quot;ma&quot; in the end (as in &quot;tegema&quot;, &quot;jooksma&quot;, &quot;kõndima&quot;), and they act similarly to the Latin example. The supine is also the common dictionary form for verbs. The Finnish equivalent of the Estonian supine in &quot;-ma&quot; is called &quot;kolmannen infinitiivin illatiivi&quot; (lit. &quot;the illative of the third infinitive&quot;), which is &quot;-maan&quot; or &quot;-mään&quot; according to vowel harmony (as in &quot;tekemään&quot;, &quot;juoksemaan&quot;, &quot;kävelemään&quot;), these, too, act similarly to the Latin as they are complements of verbs of motion.

==Romance languages==
In Romanian, the supine generally corresponds to an English construction like &quot;for&quot; [gerund]: &quot;Această carte este de citit&quot; means &quot;This book is for reading&quot;. Additionally, the supine in Romanian can be used to express English constructions such as “I have things to do,” which would be translated as “Eu am niște lucruri de făcut.” 

==Slavic languages==
The Slovene and the Lower Sorbian supine is used after verbs of movement; &quot;see&quot; Slovenian verbs. The supine was used in Proto-Slavic but it was replaced in most Slavic languages by the infinitive in later periods.
Old Czech use supine until the 14 century.

==Baltic languages==
In some dialects of Lithuanian, the supine is used with verbs of motion to indicate purpose: &quot;Moterys eina miestan duonos pirktų&quot;, which means &quot;The women are going to the town to buy some bread&quot;. The standard language uses the infinitive, pirkti, instead of the supine. In Old Lithuanian, the supine was a much more widespread form than in Modern Lithuanian.

<text>Renfrew is a small unincorporated village on the Connoquenessing Creek in Penn Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded by David A. Renfrew in 1882 on his farm. It was once a booming oil town with a general store, a school, a post office, a gas station, and a Methodist church. In September 2004, Renfrew experienced massive flooding due to rainfall caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ivan. The Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad still runs materials to and from the AK Steel mill in Butler through Renfrew along Railroad St. Once used by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, it was at one time a thriving railway that would travel down to Pittsburgh.

<doc id="552609" wikidata="Q5140094" url="?curid=552609" title="Code of the Lifemaker">
<text>Code of the Lifemaker is a 1983 novel by British science fiction author James P. Hogan. NASA&#x27;s report &quot;Advanced Automation for Space Missions&quot; was the direct inspiration for this novel detailing first contact between Earth explorers and the Taloids, clanking replicators who have colonized Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan.

A sequel titled &quot;The Immortality Option&quot; was published in 1995.

==Plot summary==

About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement. One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation damage from a near-miss by a supernova and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to evolve on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan&#x27;s short fiction.) The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the &quot;Lifemaker&quot;.

Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and NATO) dispatched the &quot;Orion&quot; with a cover story of terraforming Mars for human habitation. Karl Zambendorf, a con artist who is present on this expedition to verify ESP over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the &quot;Orion&quot; and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.

When the &quot;Orion&quot; arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other&#x27;s speech. Thirg&#x27;s brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a prophet.

Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan&#x27;s natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to slaves. The NASO business administrators on the &quot;Orion&quot; are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans &quot;Lumians&quot; because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the Ten Commandments for his people to prevent a war from starting. &quot;All Taloids are brothers&quot; and &quot;No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave&quot; does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the &quot;Orion&quot; crew not working for NASO. There will be use of Titan&#x27;s resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Code of the Lifemaker&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #73, and stated that &quot;&quot;Lifemaker&quot; never comes to terms with its own absurdity, but if you survive the stodgy opening it has its charms.&quot;

<text>The United Kingdom Mathematics Trust (UKMT) is a charity founded in 1996 to help with the education of children in mathematics within the UK.

==History==
The national mathematics competitions had existed prior to the formation of the trust, but the foundation of the UKMT in the summer of 1996 enabled them to be run collectively. The Senior Mathematical Challenge was formerly called the National Mathematics Contest. Founded in 1961, it was run by the Mathematical Association from 1975 until its adoption by the UKMT in 1996. The Junior and Intermediate Mathematical Challenges were the initiative of Tony Gardiner in 1987, and were run by him under the name of the United Kingdom Mathematics Foundation until 1996. In 1995, Gardiner advertised for the formation of a committee and for a host institution that would lead to the establishment of the UKMT, enabling the challenges to be run effectively together under one organization.

==Mathematical Challenges==
The UKMT runs a series of mathematics challenges to encourage children&#x27;s interest in mathematics and to develop their skills. The three main challenges are:
* Junior Mathematical Challenge (UK year 8/S2 and below)
* Intermediate Mathematical Challenge (UK year 11/S4 and below)
* Senior Mathematical Challenge (UK year 13/S6 and below)

==Certificates==
In the Junior and Intermediate Challenges the top scoring 50% of the entrants receive bronze, silver or gold certificates based on their mark in the paper. In the Senior Mathematical Challenge these certificates are awarded to top scoring 66% of the entries. In each case bronze, silver and gold certificates are awarded in the ratio 3 : 2 : 1.
So in the Junior and Intermediate Challenges
* The Gold award is achieved by the top 8-9% of the entrants.
* The Silver award is achieved by 16-17% of the entrants.
* The Bronze award is achieved by 25% of the entrants.
In the past, only the top 40% of participants received a certificate in the Junior and Intermediate Challenges, and only the top 60% of participants received a certificate in the Senior Challenge. The ratio of bronze, silver, and gold have not changed, still being 3 : 2 : 1.

==Junior Mathematical Challenge==
The Junior Mathematical Challenge (JMC) is an introductory challenge for pupils in Years 8 or below (aged 13) or below, taking place in spring each year. This takes the form of twenty-five multiple choice questions to be sat in exam conditions, to be completed within one hour. The first fifteen questions are designed to be easier, and a pupil will gain 5 marks for getting a question in this section correct. Questions 16-20 are more difficult and are worth 6 marks. The last five questions are intended to be the most challenging and so are also 6 marks. Questions to which no answer is entered will gain (and lose) 0 marks. However, in recent years there has been no negative marking so wrong questions will be given 0 marks. Previously, the top 40% of students (50% since the 2022 JMC) get a certificate of varying levels (Gold, Silver or Bronze) based on their score.
=== Junior Kangaroo ===
Over 10,000 participants from the JMC are invited to participate in the Junior Kangaroo. Most of the Junior Kangaroo participants are those who performed well in the JMC, however the Junior Kangaroo is open to discretionary entries for a fee. Similar to the JMC, the Junior Kangaroo is a 60 minute challenge consisting of 25 multiple-choice problems. Correct answers for Questions 1-15 earn 5 marks, and for Questions 16-25 earn 6 marks. Blank or incorrect answers are marked 0; there is no penalty for wrong answers.

The top 25% of participants in the Junior Kangaroo receive a Certificate of Merit.

===Junior Mathematical Olympiad===
The highest 1200 scorers are also invited to take part in the Junior Mathematical Olympiad (JMO). Like the JMC, the JMO is sat in schools. This is also divided into two sections. Part A is composed of 10 questions in which the candidate gives just the answer (not multiple choice), worth 10 marks (1 mark each). Part B consists of 6 questions and encourages students to write out full solutions. Each question in section B is worth 10 marks and students are encouraged to write complete answers to 2-4 questions rather than hurry through incomplete answers to all 6. If the solution is judged to be incomplete, it is marked on a 0+ basis, maximum 3 marks. If it has an evident logical strategy, it is marked on a 10- basis. The total mark for the whole paper is 70. Everyone who participates in this challenge will gain a certificate (Participation 75%, Distinction 25%); the top 200 or so gaining medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze); with the top fifty winning a book prize.

==Intermediate Mathematical Challenge==
The Intermediate Mathematical Challenge (IMC) is aimed at school years equivalent to English Years 9-11, taking place in winter each year. Following the same structure as the JMC, this paper presents the student with twenty-five multiple choice questions to be done under exam conditions in one hour. The first fifteen questions are designed to be easier, and a pupil will gain 5 marks for getting a question in this section correct. Questions 16-20 are more difficult and are worth 6 marks, with a penalty of 1 point for a wrong answer which tries to stop pupils guessing. The last five questions are intended to be the most challenging and so are also 6 marks, but with a 2 point penalty for an incorrectly answered question. Questions to which no answer is entered will gain (and lose) 0 marks.

Again, the top 40% of students taking this challenge get a certificate. There are two follow-on rounds to this competition: The European Kangaroo and the Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad. Additionally, top performers can be selected for the National Mathematics Summer Schools.
===Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad===
To prevent this getting confused with the International Mathematical Olympiad, this is often abbreviated to the &quot;IMOK Olympiad&quot; (IMOK = Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad and Kangaroo).

The IMOK is sat by the top 500 scorers from each school year in the Intermediate Maths Challenge and consists of three papers, &#x27;Cayley&#x27;, &#x27;Hamilton&#x27; and &#x27;Maclaurin&#x27; named after famous mathematicians. The paper the student will undertake depends on the year group that student is in (Cayley for those in year 9 and below, Hamilton for year 10 and Maclaurin for year 11).

Each paper contains six questions. Each solution is marked out of 10 on a 0+ and 10- scale; that is to say, if an answer is judged incomplete or unfinished, it is awarded a few marks for progress and relevant observations, whereas if it is presented as complete and correct, marks are deducted for faults, poor reasoning, or unproven assumptions. As a result, it is quite uncommon for an answer to score a middling mark (e.g. 4–6). This makes the maximum mark out of 60. For a student to get two questions fully correct is considered &quot;very good&quot;. All people taking part in this challenge will get a certificate (participation for the bottom 50%, merit for the next 25% and distinction for the top 25%). The mark boundaries for these certificates change every year, but normally around 30 marks will gain a Distinction. Those scoring highly (the top 50) will gain a book prize; again, this changes every year, with 44 marks required in the Maclaurin paper in 2006. Also, the top 100 candidates will receive a medal; bronze for Cayley, silver for Hamilton and gold for Maclaurin.

===European Kangaroo===
The European Kangaroo is a competition which follows the same structure as the AMC (Australian Mathematics Competition). There are twenty-five multiple-choice questions and no penalty marking. This paper is taken throughout Europe by over 3 million pupils from more than 37 countries. Two different Kangaroo papers follow on from the Intermediate Maths Challenge and the next 5500 highest scorers below the Olympiad threshold are invited to take part (both papers are by invitation only). The &quot;Grey Kangaroo&quot; is sat by students in year 9 and below and the &quot;Pink Kangaroo&quot; is sat by those in years 10 and 11. The top 25% of scorers in each paper receive a certificate of merit and the rest receive a certificate of participation. All those who sit either &quot;Kangaroo&quot; also receive a keyfob containing a different mathematical puzzle each year. (The puzzles along with solutions)

===National Mathematics Summer Schools===

Selected by lottery, 48 of the top 1.5% of scorers in the IMC are invited to participate in one of three week-long National Mathematics Summer Schools in July. Each from a different school across the UK, the 24 boys and 24 girls are facilitated with a range of activities, including daily lectures, designed to go beyond the GCSE syllabus and explore wider and more challenging areas of mathematics. The UKMT aims to &quot;promote mathematical thinking&quot; and &quot;provide an opportunity for participants to meet other students and adults who enjoy mathematics&quot;. They were delivered virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic but had reverted to in-person events by 2022.

==Senior Mathematical Challenge==

The Senior Mathematical Challenge (SMC) takes place in late-autumn each year, and is open to students who are aged 19 or below and are not registered to attend a university. SMC consists of twenty-five multiple choice questions to be answered in 90 minutes. All candidates start with 25 marks, each correct answer is awarded 4 marks and 1 mark is deducted for each incorrect answer. This gives a score between 0 and 125 marks.

Unlike the JMC and IMC, the top 66% get one of the three certificates. Further, the top 1000 highest scorers who are eligible to represent the UK at the International Mathematical Olympiad, together with any discretionary and international candidates, are invited to compete in the British Mathematical Olympiad and the next around 6000 highest scorers are invited to sit the Senior Kangaroo. Discretionary candidates are those students who are entered by their mathematics teachers, on payment of a fee, who did not score quite well enough in the SMC, but who might cope well in the next round.
===British Mathematical Olympiad===
Round 1 of the Olympiad is a three-and-a-half hour examination including six more difficult, long answer questions, which serve to test entrants&#x27; problem-solving skills. As of 2005, a more accessible first question was added to the paper; before this, it only consisted of 5 questions. Approximately 100 highest scoring candidates from BMO1 are invited to sit the BMO2, which is the follow-up round that has the same time limit as BMO1, but in which 4 harder questions are posed. The top 24 scoring students from the second round are subsequently invited to a training camp at Trinity College, Cambridge or Oundle School for the first stage of the International Mathematical Olympiad UK team selection.

===Senior Kangaroo===
The Senior Kangaroo is a one-hour examination to which the next around 6000 highest scorers below the Olympiad threshold are invited. The paper consists of twenty questions, each of which require three digit answers (leading zeros are used if the answer is less than 100, since the paper is marked by machine). The top 25% of candidates receive a certificate of merit and the rest receive a certificate of participation.

==Team Challenge==
The UKMT Team Maths Challenge is an annual event. One team from each participating school, comprising four pupils selected from year 8 and 9 (ages 12–14), competes in a regional round. No more than 2 pupils on a team may be from Year 9. There are over 60 regional competitions in the UK, held between February and May. The winning team in each regional round, as well as a few high-scoring runners-up from throughout the country, are then invited to the National Final in London, usually in late June.

There are 4 rounds: 
* Group Questions
* Cross-Numbers
* Shuttle (NB: The previous Head-to-Head Round has been replaced with another, similar to the Mini-Relay used in the 2007 and 2008 National Finals.)
* Relay

In the National Final however an additional &#x27;Poster Round&#x27; is added at the beginning. The poster round is a separate competition, however, since 2018 it is worth up to six marks towards the main event. Four schools have won the Junior Maths Team competition at least twice: Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School in Walsall, City of London School, St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, and Westminster Under School.

==Senior Team Challenge==

A pilot event for a competition similar to the Team Challenge, aimed at 16- to 18-year-olds, was launched in the Autumn of 2007 and has been running ever since. The format is much the same, with a limit of two year 13 (Upper Sixth-Form) pupils per team. Regional finals take place between October and December, with the National Final in early February the following year.

Previous winners are below:
==British Mathematical Olympiad Subtrust==
&quot;For more information see British Mathematical Olympiad Subtrust.&quot;

The &quot;British Mathematical Olympiad Subtrust&quot; is run by UKMT, which runs the British Mathematical Olympiad as well as the UK Mathematical Olympiad for Girls, several training camps throughout the year such as a winter camp in Hungary, an Easter camp at Trinity College, Cambridge, and other training and selection of the IMO team.

<doc id="552627" wikidata="Q1117729" url="?curid=552627" title="London 0 Hull 4">
<text>London 0 Hull 4 is the debut album by The Housemartins, released in June 1986. It contains the singles &quot;Flag Day&quot; (#124 UK), &quot;Sheep&quot; (#54 UK), &quot;Happy Hour&quot; (#3 UK) and &quot;Think for a Minute&quot; (#18 UK).

The title refers to the band&#x27;s home city of Kingston upon Hull and is in the format of a football score. It also refers to Paul Heaton&#x27;s assertion that the Housemartins were only the fourth best band in Hull. In other words, Hull had four great bands, compared to none from London. The other three Hull bands in question were Red Guitars, Everything but the Girl and The Gargoyles. The title &#x27;London 0 Hull 4&#x27; was used by various newspapers as a headline in October 2008 after the city&#x27;s newly promoted football team, Hull City, beat West Ham United to take a fourth win out of four against London-based clubs (having previously beaten Fulham, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur).

The liner notes and lyrics reflect singer Paul Heaton&#x27;s interest at that time in Christianity and Marxism. For example, the back cover of the album contains the message, &quot;Take Jesus – Take Marx – Take Hope&quot;.

The CD release of the album featured four additional tracks along with the front cover phrase, &quot;16 songs – 17 hits!&quot;.

The album was re-released on 22 June 2009, as London 0 Hull 4 Deluxe, containing a second CD of bonus tracks, B-sides and live recordings.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Paul Heaton and Stan Cullimore, except for where noted.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The ancient territory of Éile obtained its name from pre-historic inhabitants called the Eli, about whom little is known beyond what may be gathered from legends and traditions. The extent of Éile varied throughout the centuries with the rise and fall of the tribes in occupation. During this century however Éile appears to have reached its greatest extent, stretching from Croghan Bri Eli (Croghan Hill in Offaly) to just south of Cashel (in Corca Eathrach Eli). The southern part of this territory embraced the baronies of Eliogarty and Ikerrin, a great part of the modern barony of Middle Third, the territory of Ileagh (or Ileigh) and a portion of the present barony of Kilnamanagh Upper.

By the 8th century, the territory of Ancient Éile had broken up into a number of petty kingdoms: the O&#x27;Carroll occupied the northern portion, the O&#x27;Spillanes held Ileagh, the Eóganacht Chaisil had annexed Middle Third. The ancient name of the district on which the town now stands was &quot;Tuatha Corca Teine&quot;. Teine was supposed to have been the son of the King of Connacht, arriving in the district shortly after Saint Patrick. Monastic settlements were located at the site of Teine&#x27;s fort, &#x27;Land of the Monks&#x27; (). A holy man named &quot;Silean&quot; (anglicised as Sheelan) is reputed to have accompanied St Patrick and to have established a monastery in the area. There is no townland called Templemore. The townland on which the town is built is Kiltillane (), meaning Saint Sheelan&#x27;s Church.

===Feudal period===
With the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, a powerful Norman family – the Butlers – became the new overlords. Early in the 14th century, they were raised to the Earldom of Ormond and held palatine rights in County Tipperary.

The ruins of Templemore Abbey, which may have been established by the Knights Templar, lie to the north of the town in the Town Park, the demesne of the Carden family.

The Blackcastle, as it is locally known, was built in the Town Park in 1450 by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. This building and its manor lands were occupied by the Butlers and were later leased to the families of Purcell of Loughmore (Loughmoe) and Morris of Knockagh.

The O′Fogarty clan held what is now the barony of Eliogarty, while to the north of them, at least some time later, were O&#x27;Meaghers of Ikerrin.

===Carden family===

Around 1695 the Butlers sold extensive lands to an English family called Carden from Cheshire, who settled in the area and also located at Barnane and Fishmoyne. Over the next 200 years, this family was to play a significant part in the development of the town and district which has the nickname of &quot;Carden&#x27;s Wild Demesne&quot;, after the popular 19th-century poem.

Following the burning of the Blackcastle, Carden built a new estate. He built a mansion known as the Priory on the edge of the town. The architecture of the Priory was in the style of the Elizabethan era. The Priory was surrounded by a demesne which had a formal garden with paved paths around an artificial lake. Quoting from a contemporary newspaper commentary of 1861, when the Priory was still under construction:

There were extensive gardens and a lot of money was spent on them: 

The Cardens kept the ruins of the old church and graveyard. At the entrance on the Borrisoleigh Road is the gatekeeper&#x27;s lodge. After 1860, the Priory was renamed the Abbey.

Lewis&#x27; directory of 1837 lists the principal landowners in the locality at the time: 

===McCan Barracks===
McCan Barracks, originally called &quot;Richmond barracks&quot;, was constructed in 1809 on the site donated by the town&#x27;s founder and largest landowner Sir John Carden, ancestor of Sir John Carden, 6th Baronet (1892–1935), who also donated the adjoining for training and recreation. It replaced an earlier barracks located near the Ursuline convent. George Borrow resided there when he accompanied his father&#x27;s regiment to Templemore in 1816. The new barracks consisted of 2 squares, surrounded by company lines, stores, married quarters, officer&#x27;s mess, military prison, church and hospital. Completely surrounded by a high wall, with protective/defensive posts at each corner, it had accommodation for 25 officers, married quarters for 48 other ranks, and 767 unmarried personnel. A total of 36 hospital beds and 15 guardroom cells were located within the complex as well as stabling for 27 officers&#x27; horses. The surrounding area was quickly developed, with names such as Talavera Place, Vimeiro Mall and Regent Bridge, reminders of the victories of the British in the Peninsular War taking place at the time of the construction of the barracks.

In late summer 1920, Templemore was the site of alleged Marian apparitions. The town briefly became a popular pilgrimage destination. This took place during the War of Independence and also resulted in a brief truce between the IRA and Crown forces in the area.

Since February 1964, the barracks has been the site of the Garda Síochána College, the centre for training Ireland&#x27;s police force.

==Templemore today==
The town council was abolished in 2014 following the enactment of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.
===Townlands in the civil parish===
There are 38 townlands in the civil parish of Templemore. The bulk of the town of Templemore lies in the townland of Kiltillane which has the River Suir as its eastern boundary. Townlands in the north-western parts of the parish are situated in the barony of Ikerrin. From north to south they are Killough, Clontaaffe, Craiguedarg, Curraduff and Graiguebeg. The townland of Killawardy is mainly in the civil parish of Killea. Adjacent to it, but in the parish of Templemore and the barony of Eliogarty, is a townland of the same name.

===Amenities and features===
The most notable landmark in the district is the Devil&#x27;s Bit mountain range. It is an excursion point for people to visit &#x27;the Rock&#x27; and cross at the summit. Following the War of Independence, the private demesne of the Carden family came into the ownership of the town&#x27;s urban district council which handed it over to the citizens as the Town Park. The Park incorporates GAA grounds (Páirc Shíleáin), Lakeside Pitch &amp; Putt Course and an all-weather athletic track in the care of Templemore Athletic Club. The demesne&#x27;s mature woodlands features walks, the ruin of the Black Castle on the western bank of the lake and the ruin of the eponymous big church. The main focus of attention is the man-made lake (7.5 acres) which is used for coarse fishing.

On the Roscrea road there is a cluster of buildings associated with the Church of Ireland community. Among these is St Mary&#x27;s Church, which is the principal church serving the community in Templemore, Thurles and Kilfithmone. The church originally stood in front of one of the entrances to the Abbey&#x27;s parkland. When the estates locally known as &quot;The Park&quot; were built in the late 1950s, the entrance gates and avenue were removed by the town council. The church, along with St Mary&#x27;s School, the Rectory, adjacent cottage and lodge, were built in 1790 on land donated by Sir John Craven Carden.

The foundation stone for the parish church, the Church of the Sacred Heart, was laid on 1 January 1877. It stands on the site of the former residential Erasmus Smith school. At the nearby village of Loughmore is the historic Loughmoe Castle.

Templemore Town Hall, in the centre of the town, was commissioned as a market house in 1816.

===Education===
Templemore was one of the first three locations selected by the trust of Erasmus Smith in the 17th century for his schools. The Sisters of Mercy operated the St. Augustine&#x27;s Industrial School for Girls in the town from 1870 to 1965. Today&#x27;s schools include:

* St. Colmcille&#x27;s Primary School, under the ethos of the Catholic Church. 
* St. Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, under the ethos of the Catholic Church. 
* St. Mary&#x27;s National School, under the ethos of the Church of Ireland.
* Our Lady&#x27;s Secondary School (co-educational), under the ethos of the Catholic Church. It was formed when the Sisters of Mercy Convent (a day and boarding school) merged with the Christian Brothers secondary school in 1986.
* Templemore College of Further Education, a QQI college of further education offering over a wide variety mainly vocational courses. It had been named St Sheelan&#x27;s College, with second-level teaching until 2003. In 2012 it changed its name to Templemore College of Further Education.
* Garda Síochána College, the education and training college of the Garda Síochána (Irish police).

===Sport===
====Gaelic games====
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is J.K. Bracken&#x27;s GAC, formed in 1991 when clubs from Clonmore, Killea and Templemore merged. It is named for Joseph Kevin Bracken, one of the founders of the GAA, who came from Templemore. His son, Brendan, who was a member of Winston Churchill&#x27;s government in the United Kingdom during World War II, was born in Templemore.

====Golf====
There is a nine-hole golf course located at close to the Garda Síochána College just off the Thurles road. The Lakeside Pitch-and-Putt club is located beside the lake in the Town Park. Its eighteen-hole course is affiliated to the Pitch and Putt Union of Ireland.

====Angling====
Coarse fishing is available in the lake in the town park. The lake was recently restored after a period of pollution and rising phosphates. It now has a stock of native fish, as well as a fountain.

====Parkrun====
A weekly free Parkrun takes place in Templemore.
===International relations===
Templemore is twinned with the community of Prémilhat in France and with the municipality of Potenza Picena in Italy.

<text>The Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) is a series of prismatic telescopic sights manufactured by Trijicon. The ACOG was originally designed to be used on the M16 rifle and M4 carbine, but Trijicon has also developed ACOG accessories for other firearms. Models provide fixed-power magnification levels from 1.25× to 6×. ACOG reticles are illuminated at night by an internal tritium phosphor. Some versions have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiberoptic light pipe or are LED-illuminated using a dry battery. The first ACOG model, known as the TA01, was released in 1987.

==History==
The first ACOG model, known as the TA01, was released in 1987. An example was tested on the Stoner 93 in the early 1990s by the Royal Thai Armed Forces. In 1995, United States Special Operations Command selected the 4×32 TA01 as the official scope for the M4 carbine and purchased 12,000 units from Trijicon. Between 2004 and 2005, the TA31RCO-A4 &amp; M4 (AN/PVQ-31A &amp; 31B) was selected as the official Rifle Combat Optic of the United States Marine Corps, prompting Trijicon to produce 100,000 units for the US Marines in the following 18 months.

==Design==
The ACOG is available in a variety of configurations from the manufacturer with different reticles, illumination, and other features. Most ACOGs do not use batteries for reticle illumination, being designed to use internal phosphor illumination provided by the radioactive decay of tritium. The tritium illumination has a usable life of 10 to 15 years. Some versions of the ACOG have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiber optic light pipe. Normally this allows the brightness of the reticle to match the field of view since it collects ambient light from around the sight, although this can lead to a mismatch in lighting — such as sunlight hitting the light pipe directly, or standing in a shadow — causing the reticle to be much brighter or darker than the target. Reticles have other features such as a bullet drop compensator and other different reticle shapes such as chevrons.

Some ACOG models incorporate rudimentary ghost ring iron sights as a backup for targets that are within . Most ACOG models, when mounted to a carry handle, have an open space through the mount to allow the use of the rifle&#x27;s iron sights without removing the scope. Others include Docter or Trijicon reflex sights mounted on top, such as the TA11SDO (SU-258/PVQ) and the TA648MGO (SU-260P). The ACOG ECOS line features both of these secondary sighting systems on the same scope.

Other features include Picatinny rails like the TA648MGO, flip caps, and the ability to be waterproof up to .

Although the ACOG is designed for the Picatinny rail of the M16A4 and M4, it can be mounted on the carrying handles of previous models by using a special adapter. 

==Bindon aiming concept==
Several ACOG models are designed to be used with the &quot;Bindon Aiming Concept&quot;, an aiming technique developed by Trijicon founder and optical designer Glyn Bindon. The technique is essentially using the illuminated part of the reticle and its focusing rear eyepiece as a collimator sight. As in any other collimator sight, the user does not actually look through the sight but instead keeps the collimated (infinity) image of the illuminated part of the reticle in focus with the dominant eye while the other eye views the entire field of view to acquire the target. In this both-eyes-open technique the brain superimposes the aiming reticle on the target. An added part of the technique is to shift focus after acquisition to the dominant eye/telescopic image for more accurate shooting. This overcomes the problem of centering or acquiring fast traversing targets common with all telescopic sights. Only certain models of the ACOG are designed with bright enough daylight-lit fiber optic or battery-powered LED reticles that facilitate this technique. 

==Controversy==

Trijicon has been the subject of some criticism for inscribing references to Bible verses (e.g. JN8:12, referring to John 8:12, &quot;I am the Light of the World&quot;) alongside the model numbers on their ACOG sights. Starting in late 2009, Trijicon began shipping sights to the U.S. military without Bible verses.

<text>The Second Avenue Subway (internally referred to as the IND Second Avenue Line by the MTA and abbreviated to SAS) is a New York City Subway line that runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan. The first phase of this new line, with three new stations on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, opened on January 1, 2017. The full Second Avenue Line (if it will be funded) will be built in three more phases to eventually connect Harlem–125th Street in East Harlem to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan. The proposed full line would be and 16 stations long, serve a projected 560,000 daily riders, and cost more than $17 billion.

The line was originally proposed in 1920 as part of a massive expansion of what would become the Independent Subway System (IND). In anticipation of the Second Avenue Subway being built to replace them, parallel elevated lines along Second Avenue and Third Avenue were demolished in 1942 and 1955, respectively, despite several factors causing plans for the Second Avenue Subway to be cancelled. Construction on the line began in 1972 as part of the Program for Action. It was halted in 1975 because of the city&#x27;s fiscal crisis, leaving only a few short segments of tunnels completed. Work on the line restarted in April 2007 following the development of a financially secure construction plan. The first phase of the line, consisting of the 96th Street, 86th Street and 72nd Street stations, as well as of tunnel, cost $4.45 billion. A , $6 billion second phase from 96th to 125th Streets is almost ready to start construction .

Phase 1 is served by the Q train at all times and limited rush-hour N and R trains. Phase 2 will extend the line&#x27;s northern terminus from 96th Street to Harlem–125th Street. Both the Q and limited N services will be extended to 125th Street. Phase 3 will extend the line south from 72nd Street to Houston Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. Upon completion, a new T train will serve the entire line from Harlem to Houston Street. Phase 4 will again extend the line south from Houston Street to Hanover Square, maintaining the T designation for the entire line. The T will be colored since it will use the Second Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan.

==Extent and service==
Services that use the Second Avenue Line through Midtown Manhattan are to be colored . The following services use part or all of the Second Avenue Line:


===Phase 1===
Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Line opened in January 2017. It runs under Manhattan&#x27;s Second Avenue from 65th Street to 105th Street, with stations at 72nd Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street. It is double-tracked along its entire length, with tracks in parallel tubes bored by tunnel boring machines, and central island platforms at all stations. North of 96th Street, both tracks continue as storage tracks until they end at 105th Street.

As part of Phase 1, the Second Avenue Subway connects to the BMT Broadway Line using an existing connection via the 63rd Street Line. The Q, as well as limited rush-hour N and R, operates northward from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue on the Broadway Line, curving east under Central Park on the 63rd Street Line. Broadway Line trains then stop at Lexington Avenue–63rd Street with a cross-platform interchange to the train before merging with the Second Avenue Line near 65th Street. This connection also connects to the Sixth Avenue Line allowing for trains from the Sixth Avenue line to access the Second Avenue Subway, though this connection has been unused in regular service . The northbound 63rd Street Connector track dips below the level of Phase 3&#x27;s planned tunnels, providing for a future flying junction between the connector and the rest of the Second Avenue Line.

===Plans for expansion===
The long-term plans for the Second Avenue Subway involve digging of new tunnels north to Harlem–125th Street in Harlem and south to Hanover Square in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The entire line would also be double-tracked, except for a tentatively four-tracked segment between 21st and 9th Streets, including the 14th Street station, with the outer two tracks used to store trains. After Phase 4 is completed, the residents of East Harlem and the Upper East Side will have mass transit service down both Second Avenue and Broadway to the Financial District (the latter via transfer to Broadway local trains), as well as across the Manhattan Bridge to Brooklyn via the Q train.

An additional two-track connection is planned at around 63rd Street that will connect the Lower Manhattan-bound tracks on the Second Avenue Line with the Queens-bound tracks on the IND 63rd Street Line, using existing bellmouths at 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call for it to be used by regular service. Instead, it would be used for moving out-of-service trains. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line were increased, or if the Queens Bypass were built.

Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. The whole line will be designed to accommodate 30 trains per hour, with the exception of the terminal at Hanover Square, which will only be able to handle 26 trains per hour (TPH). The portion north of 63rd Street is planned to have 14 TPH on the Q and 14 TPH on the T, for a combined 28 trains per hour on both routes. South of there, only 14 TPH on the T are planned, although 12 additional TPH could be provided in the future via the 63rd Street Tunnel. The 2004 plans for the Second Avenue Subway include the construction of short track segments to allow a future extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, as well as an extension south to Brooklyn.

In order to store the 330 additional subway cars needed for the operation of the line, storage tracks would be built between 21st Street and 9th Street along the main alignment. The 36th–38th Street Yard in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, would also be reconfigured.

The Second Avenue Subway is chained as &quot;S&quot;. The track map in the 2004 FEIS showed that all stations, except for 125th Street, would have two tracks and one island platform. 72nd Street and 125th Street were conceived as three-track, two-platform stations. 72nd Street was eventually scaled down to a two-track, center island platform station in order to reduce costs, A three-tracked 72nd Street station would have allowed trains from the Broadway Line to short-turn (reverse) without interfering with mainline service on Second Avenue, as well as provided additional operational flexibility for construction work and non-revenue moves. In July 2018, the 125th Street station was also scaled down to a two-track, one-platform station because the MTA had ascertained that two-tracked terminals would be sufficient to handle train capacities, and that building a third track would have caused unnecessary impacts to surrounding buildings.

==History==
===Initial attempts===
After World War I, the New York City Subway experienced a surge in ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study at the behest of engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city&#x27;s public transport system. Turner&#x27;s final paper, titled &quot;Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System&quot;, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans was a massive trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked down to make room for the 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.

In September 1929, the Board of Transportation of the City of New York (BOT) tentatively approved the expansion, which included a Second Avenue Line with a projected construction cost of $98.9 million (equivalent to $ in ), not counting land acquisition. In the north, several spur lines in the Bronx would merge into a four-track trunk line, crossing the Harlem River south to 125th Street. There would be six tracks from 125th Street to a link with the IND Sixth Avenue Line at 61st Street, then four tracks from 61st Street to Chambers Street, and two tracks from Chambers Street to Pine Street.

The Great Depression began that year and the soaring costs of the expansion became unmanageable. Construction on the first phase of the IND was already behind schedule, and the city and state were no longer able to provide funding. In 1930, the line was scaled down, with the line from 125th to Houston Streets to be complete by 1940, as well as a spur along 34th Street to be done by 1948. This scaled-down plan was postponed in 1931. In 1932, the Board of Transportation modified the plan to further reduce costs, omitting a branch in the Bronx, and truncating the line&#x27;s southern terminus to the Nassau Street Loop.

Further revision of the plan and more studies followed. By 1939, construction had been postponed indefinitely, with only a short length being completed above the Second Avenue station. The Second Avenue Line was relegated to &quot;proposed&quot; status, and was number 14 on the Board of Transportation&#x27;s list of important transportation projects. The line was cut to two tracks with single northern branch through Throggs Neck, Bronx, a connection to the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan, and a continuation south onto the IND Fulton Street Line in Brooklyn via that line&#x27;s Court Street station. The subway&#x27;s projected cost went up to US$249 million (equivalent to $ in ). The United States&#x27; entry into World War II in 1941 halted all but the most urgent public works projects, delaying the Second Avenue Line once again.

As part of the unification of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down all over the city and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving the Upper East Side and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940. The southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensboro Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan&#x27;s far East Side. The elevated line&#x27;s closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side&#x27;s population, increased the need for a Second Avenue subway.

In 1944, BOT superintendent Philip E. Pheifer put forth a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but in 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O&#x27;Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham&#x27;s proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer&#x27;s, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was to be built in sections. In 1948, New York City was short $145 million of the $800 million program needed for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city could spend $500 million on subway construction, but this request was denied.

The BOT then ordered ten new prototype subway cars made of stainless steel from the Budd Company. These R11 cars, so called because of their contract number, were delivered in 1949 and specifically intended for the Second Avenue Subway. They cost US$100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) each; the train became known as the &quot;million dollar train&quot;. The cars featured porthole style round windows and a new public address system. Reflecting public health concerns of the day, especially regarding polio, the R11 cars were equipped with electrostatic air filters and ultraviolet lamps in their ventilation systems to kill germs.

In 1949, Queens and Lower Manhattan residents complained that the Second Avenue Subway would not create better transit options for them. In 1950, a revised plan involved connections from Queens. New York voters approved a bond measure for its construction in 1951, and the city was barely able to raise the requisite $559 million for the construction effort. However, the onset of the Korean War caused soaring prices for construction materials and saw the beginning of massive inflation. Money from the 1951 bond measure was diverted to buy new cars, lengthen platforms, and maintain other parts of the aging New York City Subway system. Out of a half-billion-dollar bond measure, only $112 million (equivalent to $ in ), or 22% of the original amount, went toward the Second Avenue Subway. By then, construction was due to start by either 1952 or 1957, with estimated completion by 1958 at the earliest.

The Third Avenue Elevated, the only other elevated line in the area, closed on May 13, 1955, and was demolished in 1956. The Lexington Avenue Line was now the only subway transportation option on the East Side, leading to overcrowding. By 1957, the 1951 bond issue had been almost entirely used for other projects, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; despaired of the line&#x27;s ever being built. &quot;It certainly will cost more than $500 million and will require a new bond issue&quot;, wrote one reporter.

=== 1970s construction ===
As the early 1960s progressed, the East Side experienced an increase in development, and the Lexington Avenue Line became overcrowded. In 1962, construction began on a connection between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges and the Sixth Avenue Line. This segment, the Chrystie Street Connection, was first proposed in the 1947 plan as the southern end of the Second Avenue line, which would feed into the two bridges. When opened in November 1967, the connection included the new Grand Street station on the Sixth Avenue Line (another station, 57th Street, opened in July 1968), and introduced the most significant service changes ever carried out in the subway&#x27;s history. Grand Street, located under Chrystie Street (the southern end of Second Avenue) was designed to include cross-platform transfers between the Sixth Avenue and Second Avenue Lines.

Separately, in 1967, voters approved a $ (worth about $ in current dollars) Transportation Bond Issue, which provided over $ (worth $ today) for New York City projects, including for a 1968 Program for Action. The City secured a $25 million Urban Mass Transportation Act (UMTA) grant for initial construction. The Program for Action proposed a Second Avenue line to be built in two phases: a first phase north of 34th Street and a second phase south of there. The Second Avenue project, for a line from 34th Street to the Bronx, was given top priority. 

The line&#x27;s planned stops in Manhattan, spaced farther apart than those on existing subway lines, proved controversial. The Second Avenue line was criticized as a &quot;rich man&#x27;s express, circumventing the Lower East Side with its complexes of high-rise low- and middle-income housing and slums in favor of a route.&quot; In response to protests, the MTA added stations at 72nd Street and 96th Street. The MTA issued a plan for a spur line, called the &quot;cuphandle&quot;, to serve the heart of the Lower East Side. Branching off from the IND Sixth Avenue Line near the Second Avenue station, the spur would run east on Houston Street, turn north on Avenue C, and turn west on 14th Street, connecting to the BMT Canarsie Line.

A combination of Federal and State funding was obtained for the project. In March 1972, the entire cost of the section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the project&#x27;s Draft Environmental Study, was estimated to be $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 million in federal funds for the northern part of the line. Preliminary estimates of the cost of the southern portion of the line came to $450 million.

Construction on a tunnel segment between 99th and 105th Streets began in October 1972. A second segment between 110th and 120th Street in East Harlem started construction in March 1973. In October 1973, the line&#x27;s Chinatown segment began construction at Canal Street under the foot of the Manhattan Bridge between Canal and Division Streets. A fourth segment started construction in July 1974, between Second and Ninth Streets in the East Village. In total, construction on the Second Avenue Line during the 1970s spanned over 27 blocks.

The city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline. The subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA, as well as a 1952 fare increase had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, but two years later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988.

In December 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction program that would reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the existing infrastructure, which was rapidly deteriorating and in dire need of repair. Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line&#x27;s construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed. These tunnels were sealed.

In 1978, when the New York City Subway was at its lowest point in its existence, State Comptroller Arthur Levitt stated that there were no plans to finish the line. During the 1980s, plans for the Second Avenue line stagnated. Construction on the 63rd Street Lines continued. The IND portion of the line opened in 1989 and extended to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Long Island City, Queens, but it did not include a connection to the Second Avenue line. Of this failure to complete construction, Gene Russianoff, an advocate for subway riders since 1981, stated: &quot;It&#x27;s the most famous thing that&#x27;s never been built in New York City, so everyone is skeptical and rightly so. It&#x27;s much-promised and never delivered.&quot;

===1990s plans===
With the city&#x27;s economic and budgetary recovery in the 1990s, there was a revival of efforts to complete construction of the SAS. Rising ridership on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the only subway trunk line east of Central Park, demonstrated the need for the Second Avenue Line, as capacity and safety concerns rose. The four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the lone rapid transit option on the Upper East Side and East Harlem since the 1955 closure of the Third Avenue elevated, is the most crowded subway line in the country. The line saw an average of 1.3 million daily riders in 2015. This is more than the daily ridership of the second-busiest subway system in the U.S., the Washington Metro, as well as more than the combined daily riderships of San Francisco&#x27;s and Boston&#x27;s transit systems. Local bus routes are just as crowded during various times of the day, with the parallel M15 local and M15 Select Bus Service routes seeing 46,000 passengers per weekday in 2016, translating to 14.5 million passengers that year.

In 1991, then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo allocated $22 million to renew planning and design efforts for the Second Avenue line, but two years later, the MTA, facing budget cuts, removed these funds from its capital budget. In 1995, the MTA began its Manhattan East Side Alternatives (MESA) study, both a MIS and a DEIS, seeking ways to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line and improve mobility on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue for logistical reasons. The MTA started the Lower Manhattan Access Study (LMA) in November 1997. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway from 63rd Street to Lower Manhattan was one of the five building alternatives developed by the study. A 1999 DEIS only proposed new subway service on Second Avenue from 63rd to 125th Street, as well as swapping the local and express services on the Broadway Line. A spur to Grand Central Terminal was considered, but later dropped.

Due in part to strong public support, the MTA Board committed in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from East Harlem to Lower Manhattan. In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA&#x27;s 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion for the construction of the Second Avenue Subway. The next year, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A new draft statement proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets; in Lower Manhattan; it was decided to build the line under Water Street.

In December 2001, the Federal Transit Administration approved the start of preliminary engineering on a full-length Second Avenue Subway. The MTA&#x27;s final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was approved in April 2004. This latest proposal is for a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, down Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District. The final plan called for the full-length Second Avenue line to carry two services: the T, with a route emblem colored , as well as a rerouted Q train. Phase 1 rerouted the Q, the Broadway Express via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to the Upper East Side at 96th Street. Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. In Phase Three, the new T train will run from 125th Street to Houston Street. The final phase will extend T train service from Houston Street to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan.

The first phase was built within budget, at $4.45 billion. Its construction site was designated as being from 105th Street and Second Avenue to 63rd Street and Third Avenue. Deep bore tunneling methods were to be used in order to avoid the disruptions for road traffic, pedestrians, utilities and local businesses produced by cut-and-cover methods of past generations. Stations were to retain cut-and-cover construction. The total cost of the line is expected to exceed $17 billion. In 2014, MTA Capital Construction President Dr. Michael Horodniceanu stated that the whole line may be completed as early as 2029, and would serve 560,000 daily passengers upon completion. As of December 2016, only Phases 1 and 2 would be completed by 2029. The line is described as the New York City Subway&#x27;s &quot;first major expansion&quot; in more than a half-century. It would add two tracks to fill the gap that has existed since the elevated Second and Third Avenue Lines were demolished in the 1950s. According to the line&#x27;s final environmental impact statement, the catchment area of the line&#x27;s first phase would include 200,000 daily riders.

===Phase 1 construction===
New York voters passed a transportation bond issue in November 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for that phase. Its passage had been seen as critical to its construction, but the bond was passed only by a narrow margin, with 55% of voters approving and 45% disapproving. At the time, the MTA said that the project would be done in 2012 in case the city&#x27;s 2012 Summer Olympics bid succeeded, which it had not. In December 2006, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced that they would allow the MTA to commit up to $693 million in funds to begin construction of the Second Avenue Subway and that the federal share of such costs would be reimbursed with FTA transit funds, subject to appropriations and final labor certification. The USDOT also later gave $1.3 billion in federal funding for the project&#x27;s first phase, to be funded over a seven-year period. Preliminary engineering and a final tunnel design was completed by a joint venture between AECOM and Arup.

In March 2007, upon completion of preliminary engineering, the MTA awarded a contract for constructing the tunnels, a launch box for the tunnel boring machine (TBM), and access shafts to S3, a joint venture of Schiavone Construction, Skanska USA Civil, and J.F. Shea Construction. A ceremonial groundbreaking took place on April 12, 2007, at the 99th Street tunnel segment built in the 1970s. Actual construction work began on April 23, 2007. At the time, it was announced that passengers would be able to ride trains on the new line by the end of 2013. Due to cost increases, several features of the subway were cut back soon after construction started: for instance, the 72nd Street station was downsized. The MTA also postponed its completion date several times to 2016.

In 2009, contracts were awarded for the 96th Street station box, as well as for excavation around the 86th Street stations. The TBM began boring the western tunnel southward from 96th Street in 2010. Contracts for tunnels to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, and for the excavation of the 72nd Street station, were awarded in 2010. The following year, contracts were awarded for excavation of the cavern at the 86th Street station, as well as construction for the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station.

The TBM, digging at a rate of approximately per day, finished its run at the planned endpoint under 65th Street on February 5, 2011, and started digging the eastern tunnel. On March 28, 2011, S3, having completed its task of completing the west tunnel to 65th Street, began drilling the east tunnel to the bellmouth at the existing Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. The portion of the west tunnel remaining to be created was then mined using conventional drill-and-blast methods. In September 2011, the TBM completed its run to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station&#x27;s bellmouth.

In July 2013, the MTA opened a Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center for Phase 1 at 1628 Second Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets. In the three years that followed, the center was visited over 20,000 times. The final contract for Phase 1 was awarded in June 2013. Blasting for the station caverns was finished in November 2013, and the muck houses were taken down at around the same time. In late 2013, many of the tracks and signal panels began to arrive at the construction site, to be installed on the line over the next few years.

In February 2016, the MTA allocated $66 million to speed up the construction of the first phase so that it could open in December. Concerns about the line&#x27;s timely opening persisted through October and November. Test trains started running on October 9, 2016, and out-of-service Q trains started running through the subway in November 2016. The new Third Avenue entrance to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station opened on December 30, 2016. The ceremonial first train, with several prominent officials in attendance, ran on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and regular service began at noon the next day. About 48,200 passengers entered the new stations on January 1, excluding passengers who toured the line by entering at a station in the rest of the system.

Because of the opening of Phase 1, ridership on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street stations decreased in January 2017 compared to January 2016. The Second Avenue Line&#x27;s three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station saw an average weekday ridership of more than 150,000 by the end of January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line&#x27;s new stations, with an average daily ridership of 44,000. By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line&#x27;s opening.

By February 2018, there were 190,000 riders per weekday, within the 5% margin of error for the 200,000-daily-rider estimate given in the Environmental Impact Statement. Rush-hour ridership was within 2% of projections. In November 2017, because of the increasing demand, Q service was increased by one trip during each rush hour, and one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service. This trip returns southbound in Q service.

===Phase 2 construction===

The second phase, between 125th and 96th Streets, was allocated $535 million in the MTA&#x27;s 2015–2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies and utility relocation. Three new stations will be constructed at 125th Street, 116th Street and 106th Street. A transfer to the Lexington Avenue Line and an intermodal connection with Metro-North Railroad would be available at the Harlem–125th Street station.

The original plan called for the main line to turn west onto 125th Street with tail tracks to Fifth Avenue, while tail tracks would continue north on a spur via Second Avenue to 129th Street. However, the tail tracks to 129th Street, as well as a proposed ancillary building at 127th Street and Second Avenue, were removed in a June 2018 update to the plans. The change in tail tracks was made because it was found that providing tail tracks at the line&#x27;s terminal will more efficiently facilitate subway service.

A bellmouth provision for extension to the Bronx remains, though shifted closer to the 116th Street station at 118th Street. Here, two outer tracks will head west toward 125th Street while space for two inner tracks will allow for an extension to the Bronx. North of 120th Street, the line will be constructed through the use of TBMs. South of 120th Street, the line will utilize the 99th–105th and 110th–120th Streets tunnel sections built during the 1970s, with a cut-and-cover tunnel connecting the segments between 105th and 110th Streets.

The Phase 2 budget was originally $1.5 billion, which would be used to start construction of the tunnels. The MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency would not be able to start construction by the end of the 5-year cycle in 2019. In April 2016, the MTA and the State of New York reached a deal to restore funding to Phase 2, with a total of $1.035 billion allocated. This budget was raised by $700 million in May 2017. By August 2017, preliminary work on the line was underway, and design of the project was being performed by Phase 2 Partnership, a joint venture of Parsons-Brinckerhoff and STV. The EIS and design were finished in 2018. In July 2018, the MTA published a Supplemental Environmental Assessment for the SAS FEIS. The FTA issued a Finding of No Significant Impact for the project on November 15, 2018.

A Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center for Phase 2, along 125th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, opened in September 2017, delayed by four months. The administration of Joe Biden approved funding for Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway in November 2021, and land acquisition for Phase 2 started in April 2022. The MTA began soliciting bids for the first construction contracts in July 2023, and estimated that construction would start by the end of the year. The MTA stated it would reduce the cost of Phase 2 by at least $1 billion through methods such as constructing smaller stations and platforms while also reutilizing tunnels built in the 1970s rather than demolishing them. Although the MTA awarded an $182 million contract in January 2024 to relocate utilities, work on that contract was delayed after Governor Kathy Hochul paused the implementation of congestion pricing in New York City in June 2024.

===Phases 3 and 4===
Phase 3, which has no funding commitments, would extend the line southward along Second Avenue from 63rd Street to Houston Street. Upon its completion, a new service will operate running between 125th and Houston Streets. Phases 2 and 3, classified as a high-priority project by the Trump administration, may cost up to a combined total of $14.2 billion.

Phase 4, which also has no funding commitments, will provide an extension from Houston Street to a permanent terminus, with storage tracks, at Hanover Square. These storage tracks, initially recommended in the SDEIS, would allow for the storage of four trains, and they would run south of Hanover Square from Coenties Slip to a traffic island near Peter Minuit Plaza at a depth of . The Hanover Square terminal is only planned to be able to turn back 26 trains per hour instead of 30 as less capacity will be needed on the line south of 63rd Street. The Hanover Square station will be deep enough to allow for the potential extension of Second Avenue Subway service to Brooklyn through a new tunnel under the East River.

==Design and cost==
===Features===
The stations on the line were built to be wider than most other underground subway stations in the system. Because of this, Horodniceanu likened the Second Avenue Subway stations to the stations on the Washington Metro. All stations on the line feature platforms, with overall lengths to provide space for power stations and ventilation plants. Tracks are built on rubber pads, which reduces noise from trains.

In August 2006, the MTA revealed that all future subway stations—including stations on the Second Avenue Subway and the 7 Subway Extension, as well as the new South Ferry station—would be outfitted with air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms by as much as . In early plans, the Second Avenue Subway was also to have platform screen doors to assist with air-cooling, energy savings, ventilation, and track safety, but this plan was scrapped in 2012 as cost-prohibitive. Stations constructed as part of Phase May 2 receive platform screen doors depending on the results of studies being conducted for their installation elsewhere.

=== Construction methods ===
The construction of the of the Second Avenue Subway underneath densely populated Manhattan will require the use of several construction methods, depending on the section of the line. The line&#x27;s tunnels will largely consist of twin tunnels with diameters of up to . About 90% of the tunneling is to be performed by tunnel boring machines. The rest will be done using the cut-and-cover method, or through the use of mined drill-and-blast, for sections averaging in length, namely the station boxes. The methods used to construct the sections of the line were confirmed in 2003, with a modification of the section north of 120th Street announced in 2016.

==== Phase 1 ====
Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Subway was constructed between the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station on the 63rd Street Lines and an existing tunnel segment between 99th Street and 105th Street, with a terminal station at 96th Street. In Phase 1, tunneling was completed between East 63rd Street and East 92nd Streets through the use of TBMs. The TBM launch box was , and is now part of the 96th Street station. Two access shafts were constructed for the 72nd Street station. Slurry or diaphragm walls, wide and long and about deep, were built alongside the sections between East 93rd and 95th Streets.

Since the rock is shallower between East 91st and 93rd Streets, secant piles did the same work at shallower depths. Earth excavation was conducted between walls once they were installed, and box structures were built using a bottom-up construction method. Temporary decking constituted the top of the boxes, and the decking both braced the excavation and supported the walls and Second Avenue traffic.

The stations at 86th and 72nd Streets were mined. This was challenging, given the number of expensive high rise properties in their vicinities. The 96th Street cut-and-cover station was about deep, making it one of the shallowest stations being built on the line. The shallowness was so that the new line could align with the preexisting piece of subway tunnel built in the 1970s between 99th and 105th Streets. Stations at the two mined stations are between deep in rock. The construction method that was used was supposed to ease concerns for buildings above the station sites, because only two shafts were required for excavation.

Of the below-ground obstacles, Arup director of construction David Caiden stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a spaghetti of tunnels, utilities, pipes and cables—I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.&quot; Complicating the process, the project must go over, or under, subway lines, Amtrak railway lines, and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel linking Manhattan and Queens, in later phases. There were geological anomalies along the way of Phase 1. Manhattan&#x27;s geology changes along the subway&#x27;s length, passing through rock and soft ground, consisting of sands, silts, and clays over Manhattan schist, and there are faults and shear zones as well as fractured rock.

Hard-rock TBMs in diameter, in length, and in weight were used to tunnel during the first phase, progressing at a rate of about per day.

==== Phase 2 ====
Phase 2 will extend the line north from the 96th Street station to the Harlem–125th Street subway station at Lexington Avenue. North of 120th Street, it will be constructed through the use of TBMs. The TBM Launch Box will be located between 118th Street and 120th Street on Second Avenue. The TBMs will head north under Second Avenue from 120th Street before turning slightly east to curve under the East River Houses, turning west on 125th Street, crossing Lexington Avenue, before ending either east of Lenox Avenue or to the west of Lenox Avenue to accommodate storage tracks. The tunnels near the 125th Street station would need to go through soft soil in addition to diving underneath the existing IRT Lexington Avenue Line. The soft-soil tunnels are in contrast to the hard-rock bored tunnels south of 92nd Street and the cut-and-cover tunnels north of that point (necessitated because Manhattan&#x27;s rock profile drops sharply north of 92nd Street). The line is designed as to not preclude the construction of a station at Lenox Avenue and the extension of the line west along 125th Street.

South of 120th Street, the line will utilize a tunnel section built during the 1970s, located between 110th Street and 120th Street. This section will have tracks and other essential equipment installed, like that of the rest of the line. Cut-and-cover will be used to connect the existing tunnel section to the bored section to the north (at 120th Street) and to the portion of the line already in operation to the south (at 105th Street) to maximize the use of the tunnel sections built in the 1970s. A bellmouth will be constructed to allow for a future extension to the Bronx at 118th Street. The storage tracks west of the 125th Street station would replace the storage tracks north of the 96th Street station, which would then be used in revenue service as part of Phase 2.

A transfer will be constructed at the eastern end of the Second Avenue Subway&#x27;s Harlem–125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line&#x27;s 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The direct connection to the staircases to the upper level will be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, staircases will lead to Park Avenue, allowing passengers to walk to the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem–125th Street station.

The station entrances for 106th Street and 116th Street will be located on the east side of Second Avenue so as to avoid utilities located on the west side of the street and to avoid potential adverse effects to the East Harlem Historic District.

==== Phases 3 and 4 ====
Phases 3 and 4 will extend the line south from 63rd Street to Houston Street and Hanover Square, respectively. As part of Phase 3, a connection to the IND 63rd Street Line would be built, allowing for non-revenue moves into Queens. This connection will be constructed through underground drilling and blasting. Bellmouths already exist for this connection east of the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. This section, like the rest of the line, will mainly consist of a two-track line. Between 21st Street and 9th Street, two additional tracks will be constructed on either side of the main alignment to allow for the storage of eight trains. This location was selected due to the sufficient depth of the area. The third phase would pass above several East River tunnels, including the 63rd Street Tunnel, the 60th Street Tunnel, the 53rd Street Tunnel, the Steinway Tunnel at 42nd Street, and the East River Tunnels at 32nd and 33rd Streets.

Like Phase 1, the sections between stations will largely be constructed through the use of TBMs, while stations will be constructed through cut-and-cover and mining, allowing for the construction of station caverns, shafts, and entrances. Five transfers are planned to connect stations on the Second Avenue Line and nearby stations on adjacent lines, increasing travel options for passengers. The transfer at Grand Street will require the construction of a mezzanine below the existing station, allowing for a vertical transfer to be constructed. The existing station will have to be rebuilt to accommodate the increased volume of passengers using the station. The Houston Street station&#x27;s transfer to the Second Avenue station of the IND Sixth Avenue Line would require some construction within the existing station.

The remaining three transfers are being proposed, and will be constructed, barring the increased cost of their construction. The transfer to the BMT Canarsie Line&#x27;s Third Avenue station would consist of a passageway that will be long. The most complicated of the transfers will be the connection between the 42nd Street station and the Grand Central station on the IRT Flushing Line. To allow for the connection to be built, a 900-foot long tunnel would be built under 42nd Street from the west side of Third Avenue to Second Avenue.

The Flushing Line station might have to be significantly reconstructed in anticipation of the increased volume of passengers and due to Americans with Disabilities Access requirements for the transfer. To allow for necessary vents and emergency exits to be built, cut-and-cover would be used. The final transfer would be between the 55th Street station and the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Either shielded mining or cut-and-cover would be used to complete the connection. The existing station would have to be modified to allow for the transfer passageway to be built.

Three construction options were evaluated during the project&#x27;s Environmental Impact Study for the portion of the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets. Like the plan from the 1970s, there would have been a cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used.

This option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options.

The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.

South of the terminal at Hanover Square, two tail tracks will be constructed through the use of a TBM to allow for the storage of four trains. The tracks would be built at a depth of about under Water Street, allowing the line to be deep enough to tunnel under the East River for a possible future extension into Brooklyn. Cut-and-cover would be used to build a vent facility at a traffic island located at Water and Whitehall Streets.

=== Cost ===
There was controversy over the high cost of the line as a whole. The project was divided up into four phases, in part, to maximize the ability of the project to receive funding from the Federal Government as part of the Department of Transportation&#x27;s New Starts Program. The initial projections for the cost of the line were made in the 2004 FEIS, with Phase 1 estimated to cost $3.8 billion, Phase 2 estimated to cost $3.4 billion, and Phases 3 and 4 each estimated to cost $4.8 billion.

Phase 1 ended up costing $500 million over its original budget of $3.8 billion—still a very high price compared to other new subway systems worldwide. Regulations set by the Buy America Act forced the MTA to purchase materials made in the United States, which led to objections when an MTA contractor bought a fire suppression system made in Finland. Finally, the private and public sector could not cooperate smoothly on the project, further raising costs. Of the $4.5 billion cost for Phase 1, $2.4 billion was allocated to building the three new stations and renovating the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. Meanwhile, $500 million was spent on design and engineering, and another $734 million was for building tunnels between the stations, tracks, signals, and trackside systems.

The rest of the cost, $800 million, was spent on &quot;construction management, real estate, station artwork, fare-collection systems and other sundry items.&quot; The stations&#x27; cost was magnified by the depth of the stations and the enormity of the caverns that needed to be excavated. The Second Avenue Subway stations have full-length mezzanines, like the original IND but unlike other deep-level projects such as London&#x27;s Elizabeth line. The stations will have full-length mezzanines as opposed to smaller mezzanines for each entrance to accommodate anticipated ridership for the full-length line and to comply with emergency egress requirements.

In December 2016, after it was announced that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway&#x27;s per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London&#x27;s Crossrail and Paris&#x27;s Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as much as it did only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway operates 24/7 service.

===Artwork===
For Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Subway, four contemporary artists were chosen to design artwork for the 96th, 86th, 72nd, and 63rd Street stations. The project consisted of four permanent installations: &quot;Blueprint for a Landscape&quot; by Sarah Sze at 96th Street; &quot;Subway Portraits&quot; by Chuck Close at 86th Street; &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; by Vik Muniz at 72nd Street; and &quot;Elevated&quot; by Jean Shin at 63rd Street. These public artworks were sponsored and commissioned as part of the MTA Arts &amp; Design program.

== Service patterns ==

=== Routes ===


The opening of Phase 1 extended Q service to 96th Street from its former terminal at 57th Street. The Q service has a rush-hour service frequency of 7 to 10 trains per hour. By contrast, the IRT Lexington Avenue Line&#x27;s express tracks () have an estimated rush-hour frequency of 30 trains per hour, or one train approximately every 2 minutes in each direction. As part of the 2004 Final Environmental Impact Study (FEIS) for the line, the Q service was planned to have a frequency of 14 trains per hour during rush hours, but this was revised due to MTA schedule changes.

A few rush hour N trains that formerly short-turned at 57th Street began to run to 96th Street in January 2017. The northbound trips are labeled as Q trains via the Sea Beach Line to reduce passenger confusion. Starting in November 2017, one northbound R train has served the line during weekday mornings, boosting service. From April 2019 to April 2020, weekend and evening M service was also diverted on the Second Avenue Subway to accommodate extra passengers during the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown.

In Phase 2, all current services will be extended to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. As part of the 2004 FEIS, it was planned for the Q service to be increased to 19 trains per hour to accommodate the projected increase in ridership. In order to allow for the construction of Phase 3, bellmouths have been constructed at the turnoff to the BMT 63rd Street Line.

=== Future full-length designation ===
When the construction of Phase 3 is completed, a new T service will operate from Harlem–125th Street to Houston Street. After Phase 4 opens, T service will run the full length of the line, from Harlem–125th Street to Hanover Square. T service is planned to operate at a frequency of 14 trains per hour during rush hours, with the combined frequency north of 72nd Street with Q service being 28 trains per hour. With the opening of Phase 3, the frequency of Q service is planned to be reduced from 19 to 14 trains per hour.

The MTA decided to designate the future service with the letter T, in part because:
* H is the Rockaway Park Shuttle&#x27;s internal route designator, which has occasionally been used publicly, most notably from 1986–93 and again in 2012–13 following Hurricane Sandy.
* The letters I and O are too easily confused with the numbers 1 and 0, respectively.
* The letter K was used until the late 1980s to denote services on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, and earlier on the BMT Jamaica Line, and thus is not preferred.
* The letters P, U and Y are more easily confused with common words.
* The letter V was in use at the time (and until 2010) to denote services on the IND Sixth Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line.

The T″s route emblem is colored (hex triplet #00ADD0, which could also be considered robin&#x27;s egg blue or teal) because the color had also been used for the JFK Express in the past. In 2011, turquoise was considered &quot;the color of the year&quot;, and at the time of the color&#x27;s selection in the 2000s, it was considered a very upscale color.

== Station listing ==
Three stations are part of Phase 1, which opened in January 2017. Three more are planned for Phase 2 (including one transfer to an existing line); six more in Phase 3 (including up to four transfers); and four more in Phase 4 (including one transfer).

<text>Enterolobium cyclocarpum, commonly known as conacaste, guanacaste, caro caro, devil&#x27;s ear tree, monkey-ear tree, or elephant-ear tree, is a species of flowering tree in the family Fabaceae, that is native to tropical regions of the Americas, from central Mexico south to northern Brazil (Roraima) and Venezuela. It is known for its large proportions, expansive, often spherical crown, and curiously shaped seedpods. The abundance of this tree, especially in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, where it is prized for the shady relief it provides from the intense sun, coupled with its immensity, have made it a widely recognized species. It is the national tree of Costa Rica.

In North America, it is often called elephant-ear tree, due to the shape of the seedpods. Other common names include devil&#x27;s ear and earpod tree, &quot;parota&quot;, and &quot;orejón&quot; (Spanish) or&quot;&#x27;huanacaxtle&quot; (Nahuatl). In El Salvador, it is known as &quot;conacaste&quot;. In the Yucatán peninsula, it is known by the Mayan name, &quot;pich.&quot; In Panama, it is known as a &quot;corotú&quot;.

== Description ==
Source:

The guanacaste is a medium-sized to large tree, growing to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. Unusual in a tree of these proportions, buttresses are completely lacking. The bark is light gray, with prominent dark reddish-brown, vertical fissures. In young trees, these fissures are closer together. and their confluence lends a characteristic reddish hue to the bark of guanacaste saplings. Older specimens often present broken, chipped, or scarred bark.

The crown is broad and widely spreading. The height at which branches first occur along the trunk – as well as the overall tree shape – vary considerably among individuals and are habitat-dependent characteristics. Frequently, guanacaste trees grow as single specimens in a sunny pasture. Under these conditions, massive, extended, horizontal limbs emerge low on the boles, forming giant, hemispherical, widely spreading crowns. In the forest (where competition for light is intense), trees tend to become taller, and branching occurs at a higher level. Tree forms then become somewhat narrower, though crowns are still rounded, and hemispherical shapes are maintained by those that have reached the canopy.

The alternate leaves are bipinnate compound, long and broad with a petiole bearing four to 15 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 40–70 leaflets; the leaflets are slender, oblong, long by wide. Near its base, the twiggy petiole bares a small, raised, oval gland. The leaves are confined to the outer shell of the crown, yet they are plentiful enough to make it moderately dense and green. The guanacaste is evergreen, or briefly deciduous for 1–2 months during the dry season. Most foliage is shed in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, a growth surge is initiated that re-establishes a fresh, thick crown by April.

Concurrent with the leaves&#x27; renewal is the appearance of globular inflorescences () in the axils of the new leaves. Supported by a long pedestal (), each spherical white head – composed of about 50 individual flowers – sports thousands of thin, filamentous stamens as its major feature. The blossoms themselves each consist of about 20 stamens and a single pistil, bound together at the base by a short, green, tubular corolla and an even shorter calyx, just long altogether. Guanacaste flowers are very fragrant, and during intense flowering periods, their odor permeates the air for many meters in all directions. In Manuel Antonio National Park near Quepos, Costa Rica, flowering lasts from late February to early April.

Surprisingly, no obvious fruiting activity immediately follows the decline of the blossom. Rather, 9–10 months pass before small, green pods first appear high in the crown by December. They reach full size by February and finally begin to ripen in March – a full year after flowering has ceased. Fruit ripening lasts from March to April, as the green pods turn brown in the guanacaste crown and are slowly shed. Vigorous trees produce large crops on a nearly annual basis. In June, guanacaste seedlings can already be seen, germinating in the moist soil of the early rainy season.

Guanacaste fruits are large ( diameter), glossy dark brown indehiscent and spirally organized pods, shaped like orbicular disks. Their shape suggests the usual Mimosoideae fruit – a long, narrow, flattened pod – taken and wound around an axis perpendicular to its plane. Made of thick, soft tissue with a leathery feel, the pods contain eight to 20 radially arranged seeds, long, wide, and thick and weighing about 1 g. Guanacaste seeds are brown and marked with a conspicuous light brown or orange ring. They are very hard, resembling small stones rather than tree seeds in their strength and durability. For germination to occur, the hard seed coat must be broken to enable water to reach the embryo. Otherwise, the seeds lie dormant indefinitely.

The ardillo (&quot;Cojoba arborea&quot;) and the iguano (&quot;Dilodendron costaricense&quot;) possess similar bipinnate leaves with extra-fine leaflets. Though of equally impressive stature, these two trees can be distinguished readily from the guanacaste; the ardillo has tan-colored, heavily wrinkled, and rough bark – nothing like the guanacaste&#x27;s unmistakably gray and vertically cracked cortex. The iguano&#x27;s leaflets are serrated (an unusual feature in a bipinnate tree), while those of the guanacaste are entire.

== Ecology ==

Guanacaste trees appear to delay the onset of fruit development—some 9 months—so that seed maturation coincides with the start of the rainy season. This adaptive behavior presumably is an adaptation to give germinating seedlings as much time as possible to establish root systems before the start of the next dry season. Both the jatobá (&quot;Hymenaea courbaril&quot;) and the cenizaro (&quot;Albizia saman&quot;) exhibit similar reproductive strategies. Of course, guanacaste trees—like all deciduous and semideciduous species in this part of the world—share in the water-conserving benefits of dry-season leaflessness.

Guanacaste flowers are heavily visited by bees—insects that probably are responsible for pollination, as well. Guanacaste seed pods, however, are completely ignored by native fauna and they accumulate on the forest floor underneath parent trees. The seeds are not eaten by any animals currently native where the tree occurs, rendering the plant an evolutionary anachronism: it has been suggested that guanacaste pods were among the foods exploited by certain species of Pleistocene megafauna that became extinct some 10,000 years ago (e.g. giant ground sloths, giant bison). Within this scenario, the tree remains today without an effective seed-dispersing vector besides humans.

As discussed above, the tough-coated guanacaste seeds do not begin to grow unless their protective covers are punctured in some way. This may be an adaptation designed to keep the seeds from germinating while still in the pods at the start of the rainy season—and very likely still underneath the parent tree after having fallen from its crown. With more time to find them, foraging ground sloths (and other extinct mammals) could eat the pods and transport the seeds to a new site. The resulting mastication and digestion of the fruits would induce seed coat abrasion, which would help seed germination. Nowadays this role of mastication and dispersal has been taken up primarily by horses and cattle.

An insect pest, common to guanacaste trees of the Costa Rican Central Valley, produces spherical green galls of diameter on new shoots in February and March. Similar parasitism seems to occur on guanacaste trees of the wet, southwestern lowlands (around Palmar Sur).

== Cultivation and uses ==

The guanacaste is among the most majestic and aesthetically pleasing of tree species in its native range. Tolerant of a wide range of rainfall levels, temperatures, and soil conditions, they can thrive in most low-elevation, tropical habitats. Guanacaste trees are highly valued as ornamentals, and the shade they provide creates many an oasis on the searing and sun-baked plains in its Pacific slope habitat.

It is widely grown as a shade tree to shelter coffee plantations and for shade and forage for cattle; it also improves soil fertility by nitrogen fixation. The guanacaste is found in USDA Growth Zones 10–12.

The wood is reddish-brown, lightweight (density ) and water-resistant; it is used to make items such as doors, windows, furniture, and cabinets, and for shipbuilding. It is considered a relatively sustainable resource for wooden furniture and design projects, largely due to the tree&#x27;s ability to quickly reach large sizes, which also makes it easier to find large natural cuts up to several meters, which is rare for other slower-growing woods, such as oak or cedar. The town of La Cruz de Huanacaxtle in Nayarit (Mexico) derives its name from the fact that a cross used to stand there made of guanacaste wood.

While the seed pods are still green, they are harvested and the seeds eaten boiled in Mexico. Healthy guanacaste trees generate massive, nearly annual crops of seeds. The attractive seeds are used in Costa Rica to make jewelry. In parts of Panama, the ripe seeds are heated in a fire until they pop like popcorn. These seeds demonstrate germination rates of nearly 100%. Guanacaste seedlings then grow rapidly, often reaching over in height in their first year. These aggressive reproductive characteristics might be beneficially exploited in reforestation projects, though the plant is considered an invasive species in some places. Its roots are strong, and those of large trees may damage nearby structures.

Guanacaste is commonly used to feed all kind of livestock; its foliage, fruits, and seeds are relished by cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, and horses.

The parota tree is believed to provide medical benefits. In Mexican folk medicine, the sap is thought to aid illnesses such as influenza and bronchitis, while the astringent properties of its green fruit are used for diarrhea. The fruit and bark also contain tannins, which are useful for leather curing and soap manufacturing, while the sap can be used as a natural adhesive or substitute for glue, or chewed as a type of gum.

== Synonyms ==

* &quot;Albizia longipes&quot; 
* &quot;Enterolobium cyclocarpa&quot; 
* &quot;Feuilleea cyclocarpa&quot; 
* &quot;Inga cyclocarpa&quot;

<text>The British Computer Society (BCS), branded BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, since 2009, is a professional body and a learned society that represents those working in information technology (IT), computing, software engineering, computer engineering and computer science, both in the United Kingdom and internationally. Founded in 1957, BCS has played an important role in educating and nurturing IT professionals, computer scientists, software engineers, computer engineers, upholding the profession, accrediting Chartered IT Professional (CITP) and Chartered Engineer (CEng) status, and creating a global community active in promoting and furthering the field and practice of computing.

==Overview==
With a worldwide membership of 57,625 members as of 2021, BCS is a registered charity and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1984. Its objectives are to promote the study and application of communications technology and computing technology and to advance knowledge of education in ICT for the benefit of professional practitioners and the general public.

BCS is a member institution of the Engineering Council, through which it is licensed to award the designation of Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer and therefore is responsible for the regulation of ICT and computer science fields within the UK. The BCS is also a member of the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies, the Seoul Accord for international tertiary degree recognition, and the European Quality Assurance Network for Informatics Education EQANIE. BCS was previously a member organisation of the Science Council, through which it was licensed to award the designation of Chartered Scientist.

BCS has an office in London. The main administrative offices are in Swindon, Wiltshire, west of London. It also has two overseas offices in Sri Lanka and Mauritius.

Members are sent the quarterly IT professional magazine &quot;ITNOW&quot; (formerly &quot;The Computer Bulletin&quot;).

BCS is a member organisation of the Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organisations which have come together to provide a forum to standardise, professionalise, and otherwise advance the discipline of Enterprise Architecture.

==History==
The forerunner of BCS was the &quot;London Computer Group&quot; (LCG), founded in 1956. BCS was formed a year later from the merger of the LCG and an unincorporated association of scientists into an unincorporated club. In October 1957, BCS was incorporated, by Articles of Association, as &quot;The British Computer Society Ltd&quot;: the first President of BCS was Sir Maurice Wilkes (1913–2010), FRS.

In 1966, the BCS was granted charitable status and in 1970, the BCS was given Armorial Bearings including the shield and crest.
The major ethical responsibilities of BCS are emphasised by the leopard&#x27;s face, surmounting the whole crest and depicting eternal vigilance over the integrity of the Society and its members.

The BCS patron is The Duke of Kent, KG. He became patron in December 1976 and has been actively involved in BCS activities, particularly having been president in the Silver Jubilee Year in 1982–1983.

On 21 September 2009, the British Computer Society went through a transformation and re-branded itself as &quot;BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT&quot;. In 2010, an Extraordinary General Meeting was called to discuss the direction of the BCS. The debate has been covered by the computing press.

==Governance==
BCS is governed by a Trustee Board comprising the President, the Deputy President, the immediate past President, up to nine Vice Presidents (including Vice-president Finance), and five Professional Members elected by the Advisory Council. Sir Maurice Wilkes, Professor of Computer Science at Cambridge University, served as its first president. Each president serves for a 2-year term. A list of presidents of the British Computer Society can be found on the BCS website.

The BCS Advisory Council elects the Honorary Officers – the President, the Deputy President and up to nine vice-presidents, together with the immediate past President and five members of Council. Lists of Trust Board and Advisory Council members are maintained online.

The Advisory Council provides advice to the Trustee Board on the direction and operation of BCS; in particular, it is consulted on strategic plans and the annual budget. The council is a representative body of the membership, with members elected directly by the professional membership, and by the Branches, Groups and Forums.

==Fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS)==

The Fellow of the BCS (FBCS) title is conferred on individuals to recognise their outstanding achievements and contributions to Information Technology (engineering, product management, business leadership, etc.). Fellows are expected to give something back to the profession, by promoting and evangelising the profession to the
public and society, and contributing to debates in conferences, panels, meetings, etc. 
Fellows are nominated to the society each year and have to be supported by one or more existing fellows. Criteria for election to fellow include:

* Demonstrate leadership in the profession
* Wide acknowledgement of specific IT expertise
* Contribution to the advancement of knowledge 
* Eminent individual 
* Authority and seniority, including leading major projects and managing teams.

Current fellows
include distinguished individuals from industries and universities. Some of the prominent fellows include:

* Dame Wendy Hall, FBCS – ex-President of BCS
* Andy Harter, FBCS – CEO of RealVNC
* Tony Hey, FBCS – ex-VP of Microsoft Research
* Hermann Hauser, Distinguished FBCS – founder of ARM Ltd.
* Frank Zhigang Wang, FBCS –inventor of spin-tunneling random access memory.

The society also awards Honorary Fellowships. Examples include:

* Dorothy Monekosso, who received the honour for her work on Smart Homes for people living with dementia and for her campaigning work to promote diversity in the tech sector.

Since July 2021, Fellows are eligible to be appointed to the Fellows Technical Advisory Group (F-TAG). F-TAG provides technical thought leadership governance for BCS, informing policy positions and content.

==Chartered IT Professional==
The BCS is the only professional body in the United Kingdom with the ability to grant chartered status to IT professionals under its Royal Charter, granted to them by the Privy Council. Thus having the ability to grant Chartered (Professional) status to both its Fellows and Professional members. Known as Chartered IT Professional, they are entitled to use the suffix CITP. The BCS keeps a register of current Chartered Members and Fellows.

Other Professional membership bodies apply to the BCS for a licence that enables them to award CITP to their eligible members.

==Grades of membership==
BCS has different grades of membership:

;Honorary grades
* Distinguished Fellow (Only 24 awards since 1971)
* Honorary Fellowship (Hon FBCS) (Only 104 awarded to date)

;Professional grades
* Fellow (FBCS)
* Member (MBCS)

;Ordinary grades
* Associate Member (AMBCS)
* Student Member

;Group, corporate and other membership categories
* Affiliate: for those with an interest in IT but not yet employed in an IT role.
* Group membership: nearly 200 organisations now encourage their IT professionals to join the Society through its Group Membership Scheme.
* Education affiliates: education intuitions can also be accredited by BCS.

;Other Chartered designations
* The Engineering Council UK has licensed the BCS to award Chartered Engineer status (&quot;CEng&quot;) and Incorporated Engineer status (&quot;IEng&quot;).
* The Science Council formerly licensed the BCS to award Chartered Scientist status (&quot;CSci&quot;). However, the BCS no longer offers Chartered Scientist status (&quot;CSci&quot;)
* Members may also apply through BCS to the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI) for European Engineer (&quot;EUR ING&quot;) status.

;Designatory (post-nominal) letters
Members are encouraged to display the designatory letters to which they are entitled whenever appropriate. The order of designatory (post-nominal) letters is complex and open to a certain amount of interpretation. The accepted authority on this subject is &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Correct Form&quot;. Normally these should appear after decorations, degrees and chartered letters. Members holding CEng should also display the designatory letters of the institution through which they are registered immediately after the CEng. Conventionally, members holding Chartered status (CITP) display this immediately after their membership letters (e.g., FBCS CITP or MBCS CITP). However, as CITP may now be awarded by other organisations it may also be displayed separately, following that of the awarding institution.

==Awards==
The society provides several awards to recognise outstanding computer scientists, engineers, experienced and young IT professionals.
The awards include:

* Lovelace Medal
* Roger Needham Award
* Early Career Award
* John Perry Prize
* Distinguished Dissertation Award
* UK IT Industry Awards

<doc id="552664" wikidata="Q1692699" url="?curid=552664" title="Royal Statistical Society">
<text>The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) is an established statistical society. It has three main roles: a British learned society for statistics, a professional body for statisticians and a charity which promotes statistics for the public good.

== History ==

The society was founded in 1834 as the Statistical Society of London, though a perhaps unrelated London Statistical Society was in existence at least as early as 1824. At that time there were many provincial statistics societies throughout Britain, but most have not survived. The Manchester Statistical Society (which is older than the LSS) is a notable exception. The associations were formed with the object of gathering information about society. The idea of statistics referred more to political knowledge rather than a series of methods. The members called themselves &quot;&quot; and the original aim was &quot;...procuring, arranging and publishing facts to illustrate the condition and prospects of society&quot; and the idea of interpreting data, or having opinions, was explicitly excluded. The original seal had the motto &quot;Aliis Exterendum&quot; (for others to thresh out, i.e. interpret) but this separation was found to be a hindrance and the motto was dropped in later logos.

During its founding time, political economy as understood back then was concerned with the principles (causal models) of economy formulated in words, while statistics was concerned with collecting and tabulating quantitative data of economy, without additional interpretation. During 1830s, it concentrated on the condition of England question. By the 1840s it changed focus to the sanitary movement. It was many decades before mathematics was regarded as part of the statistical project.

==Fellows==
Fellowship of the Royal Statistical Society is open to anyone with an interest in statistics. It is not restricted to only those with high achievement within the discipline. This distinguishes it from other learned societies, where usually the fellow grade is the highest grade in that discipline.

=== Key figures ===
Instrumental in founding the Statistical Society of London were Richard Jones, Charles Babbage, Adolphe Quetelet, William Whewell, Thomas Malthus, and William Henry Sykes. Among its famous members was Florence Nightingale, who was the society&#x27;s first female member in 1858. Stella Cunliffe was the first female president. Other notable RSS presidents have included William Beveridge, Ronald Fisher, Harold Wilson, and David Cox.
Honorary Secretaries include Gerald Goodhardt (1982–88).

=== Royal Charter ===
The LSS became the RSS (Royal Statistical Society) by Royal Charter in 1887, and merged with the Institute of Statisticians in 1993. The merger enabled the society to take on the role of a professional body as well as that of a learned society. As of 2019, the society claims more than 10,000 members around the world, of whom some 1,500 are professionally qualified, with the status of Chartered Statistician (CStat). In January 2009, the RSS received Licensed Body status from the UK Science Council to award Chartered Scientist status. Since February 2009 the society has awarded Chartered Scientist status to suitably qualified members.

Unusually among professional societies, all members of the RSS are known as &quot;Fellows&quot;. Fellowship is nowadays not usually used by post-merger members as a post-nominal mark of distinction. However, before the 1993 merger with the Institute of Statisticians, Fellows often used the post-nominal letters FSS. Before the merger, Fellows were required to have a statistical qualification. The alternative route was to be proposed by two Fellows. The nomination paper then had to be approved by the Council. After the merger these requirements were dropped and all the previous members of the Institute of Statisticians became Fellows as well. Since then, use by new members of their unearned post-nominal FSS qualification was viewed as inappropriate and strongly discouraged, and it became less common.

== Structure ==
The RSS has premises (including offices and meeting rooms) in Errol Street, EC1, in the London Borough of Islington close to the boundary with the City of London, between Old Street and Barbican stations.

The society has various local groups in the UK, together with a wide range of topic-related sections and special interest groups. Each of these sections and groups organises lectures and seminars on statistical topics.

== Functions ==
The society was particularly engaged with the passage of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, having long argued for legislation on statistics.

=== Events ===
The RSS organises an annual conference. Among the society&#x27;s awards are the Guy Medals in gold, silver and bronze, in honour of William Guy.

The RSS team reached the finals of &quot;University Challenge: The Professionals 2006&quot;, where they were beaten 230 to 125 by a team from the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

=== Publications ===

The society publishes the &quot;Journal of the Royal Statistical Society&quot;, which currently consists of three separate series of journals whose contents include papers presented at ordinary meetings of the society, namely Series A (&quot;Statistics in Society&quot;), Series B (&quot;Statistical Methodology&quot;) and Series C (&quot;Applied Statistics&quot;), as well as a general audience magazine called &quot;Significance&quot; published in conjunction with the American Statistical Association. In September 2013, the society established &quot;StatsLife&quot;, an online magazine website that featured news, interviews and opinion from the world of statistics and data, though this appears to have been discontinued.

<doc id="552671" wikidata="Q5971908" url="?curid=552671" title="Lavos">
<text>Lavos (ラヴォス, &quot;Ravosu&quot;) is a fictional extraterrestrial monster and the main antagonist of the 1995 role-playing video game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, also appearing as an antagonist in its sequel, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. A parasitic alien that falls from the skies in 65,000,000 B.C., its impact results in an ice age. In the intervening time, it drains the planet&#x27;s energy, until in 1999 A.D., it resurfaces, causing an apocalypse that destroys most life on the planet.

The character of Lavos became one of the most iconic antagonists in video games, and was praised by critics due to its Lovecraftian design, mysterious origins and motivations, and the player&#x27;s unique ability to travel to 1999 and fight it at any time in the story, resulting in multiple potential endings, something assisted by the game&#x27;s New Game Plus mode. By the same token, it was noted for lacking characterization and serving only as an evil force and motivator for the game&#x27;s characters.

== Characteristics ==
The exterior of Lavos consists of a spiky shell that protects its true form within. It is suggested that Lavos originated as the spawn of another, similar creature, due to its life-cycle of replication. A parasite, Lavos travels from planet to planet, burrowing into the core and sapping its energy for millions of years, and collecting the DNA of its organisms for its own. Finally, upon the planet&#x27;s eventual destruction, it creates Lavos Spawn, offspring that leave the planet and continue the cycle.

Lavos&#x27;s mere presence has profound effect on organic life, with some characters attributing the evolution and extinction of many important organisms to it, especially humanoid races. There is reoccurring interest in the story from those seeking power to attempt to communicate with Lavos despite the danger; it is unclear whether Lavos is truly &quot;evil&quot; or even if it is fully sapient. It has a general lack of dialog and behaves similarly to an animal, being possibly oblivious to its effect on life beyond collateral damage. That said, Lavos&#x27; secondary and tertiary forms are technological in nature, suggesting some form of intellect.

== Appearances ==

=== &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; ===
Lavos initially crash-lands on the planet in 65,000,000 B.C., an event witnessed by the prehistoric Ayla, who coins the name &quot;Lavos&quot; by combining the Iokan words for &quot;big&quot; and &quot;fire&quot;. As Lavos is a name invented by humans, its true name, if one exists, is completely unknown. The ensuing ice age causes the Reptites, an advanced species of reptilian humanoids, to go extinct, incidentally ensuring the survival of the human race. In 12,000 B.C., the Kingdom of Zeal is powered by the energy of Lavos through the use of the Mammon Machine, although this relationship is symbiotic, with Lavos also gathering the kingdom&#x27;s magic. Queen Zeal attempts to use the machine to harness even more power, via her daughter, Schala. Magus intervenes, rescuing Schala, but prompting the awakening of Lavos and the destruction of Zeal. In 600 A.D., Lavos awakens yet again when the party battles Magus, causing a split in the timeline. Finally, in 1999 A.D., the &quot;Day of Lavos&quot;, a recording shows Lavos emerging from underground and destroying the world, leaving only a few human survivors and no food. Lavos then possibly moves beneath Death Peak, where many of its spawn can be found in the post-apocalyptic world of 2300 A.D.

The battle against Lavos in 1999 A.D. starts with its outer shell, which goes through phases in which it mimics other bosses the player has fought. After the shell is defeated, the player moves inside to fight its true form, first as a giant humanoid whose arms must be destroyed before the head is vulnerable, and then as a smaller humanoid with two assisting &quot;bits&quot; (although the right side bit is actually the true essence of Lavos). While players can battle Lavos at any time after arriving at the End of Time, they will struggle to beat it before the recommended point in the story and achieve many of the game&#x27;s multiple endings. However, New Game Plus mode allows players to defeat Lavos early with much greater ease, prompting many what-if scenarios, some of which are joke endings.

The 2008 Nintendo DS port of the game links the story to &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; by adding a hidden superboss, the Dream Devourer, the result of Schala becoming fused with Lavos following the disaster at the Ocean Palace. The Dream Devourer&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Crono and his allies only momentarily frees Schala from its control, who tells Magus to forget she ever existed.

=== &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; ===
The interactive fiction spin-off &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; reveals that a wayward piece of Lavos, the Frozen Flame, enabled early humans to communicate with the creature, greatly evolving them and allowing them to both use magic and create the Kingdom of Zeal. This plot point is also used in &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, where the Frozen Flame is again a major aspect of the story. The final boss, the Devourer of Time, is a fusion of Lavos, Schala, and the Dragon God capable of destroying all of spacetime if left to its own devices. As in the previous game, there are also numerous alternate endings caused by defeating it at various times in the story.

== Development ==
Lavos was designed by manga artist Akira Toriyama, and its sprite was drawn by Tsutomu Terada. Due to a lack of references by Toriyama, there were many arguments within Square on how he would have designed different aspects of Lavos when creating its in-game representation. The creature has Lovecraftian influences, with its Japanese name possibly referencing &quot;Ravukurafuto&quot;, the Japanese rendering of &quot;Lovecraft&quot;. Similar to the Great Ones of the cosmic horror genre, Lavos is also an ancient creature from beyond the known universe. However, its physical design, which is not inconceivable or amorphous, as well as its penchant for indiscriminate destruction, more resembles that of a kaiju.

== Reception ==

Jeremy Signor of &quot;1UP&quot; called Lavos &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;strange&quot;, with &quot;a truly alien vibe that we rarely see in media&quot; that depicts &quot;the inherent &#x27;otherness&#x27; of beings from another world&quot;. In &quot;Reverse Design: Chrono Trigger&quot;, Patrick Holleman stated that the boss battle against Lavos was not &quot;especially difficult&quot;, with the initial boss rush being &quot;a little cheesy&quot;, but that it was nevertheless an &quot;unqualified success&quot; due to its status as serving as the culmination of the game&#x27;s story. Casey Foot of &quot;TheGamer&quot; described Lavos as &quot;the perfect antagonist for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;’s story&quot;, explaining that it did not distract from the other plot points, acting as &quot;an overarching threat&quot; that, across different time periods, the characters must come together to defeat. However, Bryan Vore of &quot;Game Informer&quot; critiqued Lavos as a &quot;faceless engine of destruction&quot; rather than a true character, saying that Magus needed to &quot;pick up Lavos&#x27; slack&quot;. &quot;The Escapist&quot; writer Anthony John Angello discussed Lavos in the context of the real-world climate crisis. They note that unlike in reality, where the existential threat is complicated, with multiple causes and issues to address, Lavos represents a singular threat that the protagonists need to defeat in order to save the world. They speculated that the reason why it seemed so easy for the protagonists to pursue defeating Lavos is because of the singular nature of the threat, whereas unifying people against climate change was far more difficult. Angello also drew parallels between the message that reads if players experience a game over while fighting Lavos: &quot;But ... the world refused to change&quot; and James Lovelock&#x27;s longstanding opinion that &quot;changing [the] future&quot; is impossible. Writer Michael P. Williams compared Lavos to creatures in Lovecraftian works, citing aspects such as destruction of the world for its gain, its driving insane of Earth&#x27;s inhabitants, and it being an &quot;ancient being from beyond the known universe.&quot; Williams notes that Lavos is unlike Lovecraftian creatures in other ways, such as it being &quot;deadly physical and highly resilient&quot; unlike Lovecraftian works&#x27; &quot;inconceivable, amorphous horror&quot; creatures. Williams noted Lavos as not being evil, unlike other characters in games at the time, such as Kefka from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and Zemus from &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, who Williams compared to Queen Zeal instead. Williams argued that, regardless of the harm Lavos poses, Lavos was necessary for the survival of the human race.

<text>The Rift Valley lakes are a series of lakes in the East African Rift valley that runs through eastern Africa from Ethiopia in the north to Malawi in the south, and includes the African Great Lakes in the south. These include some of the world&#x27;s oldest lakes, deepest lakes, largest lakes by area, and largest lakes by volume. Many are freshwater ecoregions of great biodiversity, while others are alkaline &quot;soda lakes&quot; supporting highly specialised organisms.

The Rift Valley lakes are well known for the evolution of at least 800 cichlid fish species that live in their waters. More species are expected to be discovered.

The World Wide Fund for Nature has designated these lakes as one of its Global 200 priority ecoregions for conservation.

==Geology==
Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika have formed in the various valleys of the East African Rift zone. Lake Kivu&#x27;s &quot;still waters ... hide another face: dissolved within are billions of cubic meters of flammable methane and more still of carbon dioxide, the result of volcanic gases seeping in.&quot;

== Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes national park ==
The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes are the northernmost of the African Rift Valley lakes. In central Ethiopia, the Main Ethiopian Rift, also known as the Great Rift Valley, splits the Ethiopian highlands into northern and southern halves, and the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes occupy the floor of the rift valley between the two highlands. Most of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes do not have an outlet, and most are alkaline. Although the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes are of great importance to Ethiopia&#x27;s economy, as well as being essential to the survival of the local people, there were no intensive and extensive limnological studies undertaken of these lakes until recently.

The major ones are
* Lake Abaya (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ), the largest Ethiopian Rift Valley lake by surface area
* Lake Chamo (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth )
* Lake Zway or Dambal (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth )
* Lake Shala (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ), the deepest Ethiopian Rift Valley lake and the largest by water volume
* Koka Reservoir (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth not listed)
* Lake Langano (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth )
* Lake Abijatta (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth )
* Lake Awasa (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth )

Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile, lies in the Ethiopian highlands north of the Rift Valley; however, it is not a Rift Valley lake.

== Eastern Rift Valley lakes ==

South of the Ethiopian highlands, the rift valley splits into two major troughs. The Eastern Rift is home to the Kenyan Rift Valley lakes, while most of the Central African Rift Valley lakes lie in the Western Rift. This area includes the Gregory Rift in Kenya and Tanzania.

===Kenya ===
The Kenyan section of the Rift Valley is home to eight lakes, of which three are freshwater and the rest alkaline. Of the latter, the shallow soda lakes of the Eastern Rift Valley have crystallised salt turning the shores white and are famous for the large flocks of flamingo that feed on crustaceans.
* Lake Baringo: second largest of the Kenyan Rift Valley lakes.
** , elevation , freshwater
* Lake Bogoria: shallow soda lake, a national preserve.
** , elevation 
* Lake Elmenteita: shallow soda lake.
* Lake Logipi: a shallow hot-spring fed soda lake in the Suguta Valley just south of Lake Turkana. Formerly Lake Suguta
* Lake Magadi: shallow soda lake near the southern border with Tanzania.
* Lake Naivasha:
** although it varies somewhat with rainfall, elevation , freshwater
* Lake Nakuru: shallow soda lake, has been a national park since 1968.
** , elevation 
* Lake Turkana: the largest of the Kenyan lakes, on the border of Kenya and Ethiopia.
** , elevation , freshwater

===Tanzania===
All the lakes in the Tanzanian section of this group are alkaline:
* Lake Eyasi: shallow soda lake
* Lake Makati: shallow soda lake
* Lake Manyara: shallow soda lake
* Lake Natron: shallow soda lake that has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as being in the East African halophytics ecoregion.

== Western or Albertine Rift Valley lakes ==

The lakes of the Western or Albertine Rift, with Lake Victoria, include the largest, deepest, and oldest of the Rift Valley Lakes. They are also referred to as the Central African lakes. Lakes Albert, Victoria, and Edward are part of the Nile River basin.

Lake Victoria (elevation ), with an area of , is the largest lake in Africa. It is not in the Rift Valley, instead occupying a depression between the eastern and western rifts formed by the uplift of the rifts to either side. Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi are sometimes collectively known as the African Great Lakes.

The Western Rift Valley lakes are fresh water and home to an extraordinary number of species. Approximately 1,500 cichlid fish (Cichlidae) species live in the lakes. In addition to the cichlids, populations of Clariidae, Claroteidae, Mochokidae, Poeciliidae, Mastacembelidae, Centropomidae, Cyprinidae, Clupeidae and other fish families are found in these lakes. They are also important habitats for a number of amphibian species, including &quot;Amietophrynus kisoloensis&quot;, &quot;Bufo keringyagae&quot;, &quot;Cardioglossa cyaneospila&quot;, and &quot;Nectophryne batesii&quot;.

* Lake Albert (, elevation ) is the northernmost lake in the western rift.
* Lake Edward (, elevation ) drains north into Lake Albert
* Lake Kivu (, elevation ) empties into Lake Tanganyika via the Ruzizi River.
* Lake Tanganyika (, elevation ) is the largest and deepest of the Rift Valley lakes (more than ), and is the second deepest fresh water lake on the planet (after Lake Baikal). Below roughly 200 meters depth, its water is anoxic and devoid of life besides anoxic bacteria. It is very sensitive to climate. It is part of the Congo River basin, feeding into the River Congo via the Lukuga River.

== Southern Rift Valley lakes (Tanzania and Malawi)==
The Southern Rift Valley lakes are like the Western Rift Valley lakes in that, with one exception, they are freshwater lakes.
* Lake Rukwa (about but quite variable) in Tanzania is the alkaline exception, lying south-east of Tanganyika, and has no outlet.
* Lake Malawi (, elevation ), the second largest and second deepest of the Rift Valley lakes at over , is drained by the Shire River, a tributary of the Zambezi River. Also known as Lake Nyasa.
* Lake Malombe () is on the Shire River.
* Lake Chilwa (, elevation ) has no outlet but extensive wetlands. It is the southernmost of the Rift Valley lakes.

== Other lakes of the Great Rift Valley ==
* Lake Mweru ( elevation 922 m) lies in the Lake Mweru-Luapula graben, which is a branch off the Albertine rift.
* Lake Mweru Wantipa (, elevation ) is a marshy lake between lakes Tanganyika and Mweru, and is endorheic but may overflow into Lake Mweru at times of very high flood.

<doc id="552755" wikidata="Q1365091" url="?curid=552755" title="Steatosis">
<text>Steatosis, also called fatty change, is abnormal retention of fat (lipids) within a cell or organ. Steatosis most often affects the liver – the primary organ of lipid metabolism – where the condition is commonly referred to as fatty liver disease. Steatosis can also occur in other organs, including the kidneys, heart, and muscle. When the term is not further specified (as, for example, in &#x27;cardiac steatosis&#x27;), it is assumed to refer to the liver.

Risk factors associated with steatosis are varied, and may include diabetes mellitus, protein malnutrition, hypertension, cell toxins, obesity, anoxia, and sleep apnea.

Steatosis reflects an impairment of the normal processes of synthesis and elimination of triglyceride fat. Excess lipid accumulates in vesicles that displace the cytoplasm. When the vesicles are large enough to distort the nucleus, the condition is known as macrovesicular steatosis; otherwise, the condition is known as microvesicular steatosis. While not particularly detrimental to the cell in mild cases, large accumulations can disrupt cell constituents, and in severe cases the cell may even burst.

== Pathogenesis ==
No single mechanism leading to steatosis exists; rather, a varied multitude of pathologies disrupt normal lipid movement through the cell and cause accumulation. These mechanisms can be separated based on whether they ultimately cause an oversupply of lipid which can not be removed quickly enough (i.e., too much in), or whether they cause a failure in lipid breakdown (i.e., not enough used).

Failure of lipid metabolism can also lead to the mechanisms which would normally utilise or remove lipids becoming impaired, resulting in the accumulation of unused lipids in the cell. Certain toxins, such as alcohols, carbon tetrachloride, aspirin, and diphtheria toxin, interfere with cellular machinery involved in lipid metabolism. In those with Gaucher&#x27;s disease, the lysosomes fail to degrade lipids and steatosis arises from the accumulation of glycolipids. Protein malnutrition, such as that seen in kwashiorkor, results in a lack of precursor apoproteins within the cell, therefore unused lipids which would normally participate in lipoprotein synthesis begin to accumulate.

=== Macrovesicular steatosis ===
Macrovesicular steatosis is the more common form of fatty degeneration and may be caused by oversupply of lipids due to obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insulin resistance, or alcoholism. Nutrient malnutrition may also cause the mobilisation of fat from adipocytes and create a local oversupply in the liver where lipid metabolism occurs. Excess alcohol over a long period of time can induce steatosis. The breakdown of large amounts of ethanol in alcoholic drinks produces large amounts of chemical energy in the form of NADH, signalling to the cell to inhibit the breakdown of fatty acids (which also produces energy) and simultaneously increase the synthesis of fatty acids. This &quot;false sense of energy&quot; results in more lipid being created than is needed.

=== Microvesicular steatosis ===

Microvesicular steatosis is characterized by small intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles (liposomes) which accumulate within hepatocytes. It is associated with a wide variety of conditions, including alcoholism, drug toxicity of several medications, delta hepatitis (in South America and Central Africa), sudden childhood death, congenital defects of fatty acid beta oxidation, cholesterol ester storage disease, Wolman disease and Alpers syndrome.

== Histology ==
Histologically, steatosis is physically apparent as lipid within membrane bound liposomes of parenchymal cells. When this tissue is fixed and stained to be better viewed under a microscope, the lipid is usually dissolved by the solvents used to prepare the sample. As such, samples prepared this way will appear to have empty holes (or vacuoles) within the cells where the lipid has been cleared. Special lipid stains, such as Sudan stains and osmium tetroxide are able to retain and show up lipid droplets, hence more conclusively indicating the presence of lipids. Other intracellular accumulations, such as water or glycogen, can also appear as clear vacuoles, therefore it becomes necessary to use stains to better determine what substance is accumulating.

Grossly, steatosis causes organ enlargement and lightening in colour. This is due to the high lipid content increasing the organ&#x27;s volume and becoming visible to the unaided eye. In severe cases, the organ may become vastly enlarged, greasy, and yellow in appearance.
== Medical imaging ==

On X-ray computed tomography (CT), the increased fat component will decrease the density of the liver tissue, making the image less bright. Typically the density of the spleen and liver are roughly equivalent. In steatosis, there is a difference between the density and brightness of the two organs, with the liver appearing darker.
On ultrasound, fat is more echogenic (capable of reflecting sound waves). The combination of liver steatosis being dark on CT and bright on ultrasound is sometimes known as the flip flop sign.

On magnetic resonance imaging, multiecho gradient echo images can be used to determine the percent fat fraction of the liver. The different resonance frequencies between water and fat make this technique very sensitive and accurate. Acquisition of echoes in &quot;in phase&quot; and &quot;out phase&quot; conditions (pertaining to the relative phases of the fat and water proton contingents) enables to obtain a signal proportional to the water and fat contingent, or a signal proportional to the water minus the fat contingent. These signal intensities are then algebraically combined into a percent fat. More recent techniques take into account experimental noise, signal decay and spectroscopic properties of fat. Numerous validation studies have demonstrated excellent correlations between the steatosis level quantified at MRI and the steatosis levels semi-quantitatively and quantitatively determined on liver biopsies (reference methods). Several MRI vendors offer automated calculation of percent fat with acquisition sequences no longer than a single breath hold.

On abdominal ultrasonography, steatosis is seen as a hyperechoic liver as compared to the normal kidney.

==Incidence==

In Bristol University&#x27;s study Children of the 90s, 2.5% of 4,000 people born in 1991 and 1992 were found by ultrasound scanning at the age of 18 to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; five years later transient elastography (fibroscan) found over 20% to have the fatty deposits on the liver of steatosis, indicating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; half of those were classified as severe. The scans also found that 2.4% had the liver scarring of fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis.

<doc id="552756" wikidata="Q4345664" url="?curid=552756" title="That Dog">
<text>That Dog (stylized as that dog.) is a Los Angeles-based rock band that formed in 1992 and disbanded in 1997, reuniting in 2011. The band originally consisted of Anna Waronker on lead vocals and guitar, Rachel Haden on bass guitar and vocals, her sister Petra Haden on violin and vocals, and Tony Maxwell on drums.

The band&#x27;s original work drew critical comparisons with the output of Redd Kross, Wednesday Week, Dolly Mixture and Buzzcocks.

==History==

===Formation===
Lead vocalist Anna Waronker is the daughter of record industry mogul Lenny Waronker and singer Donna Loren, and the sister of drummer Joey Waronker of Beck, R.E.M. and Atoms for Peace. She is married to Steve McDonald of Redd Kross. Petra and Rachel Haden are daughters of jazz bassist Charlie Haden.

The group began when Anna and a friend, Jenni Konner, began writing short punk songs in her bedroom about boys. Waronker had known Petra and Rachel Haden since high school. Maya Rudolph was the band&#x27;s original drummer, before moving to attend college, after which mutual friend Tony Maxwell took over.

===Releases and Touring===
Their self-titled first album was originally released on a limited run as a double 7&quot; on the independent label Magnatone Records in 1992. It was soon after re-released on cassette and compact disc by Geffen. During this time, the band was good friends with, often played on records by, and toured with label mates Beck and Weezer. Members contributed to the Beck songs &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Totally Confused&quot; and the single &quot;Steve Threw Up&quot;, as well as Weezer&#x27;s &quot;I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams&quot;, all released as B-sides by the aforementioned artists.

1995 saw the release of &quot;Totally Crushed Out!&quot; to little fanfare. The band&#x27;s members also contributed to several tracks on Mike Watt&#x27;s &quot;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&quot; record.

On April 8, 1997, that dog. released their third album, &quot;Retreat from the Sun&quot;, and added Kenny Woods (Steven McDonald Group, Beck, Anders &amp; Woods) on guitar. &quot;Retreat from the Sun&quot; spawned the group&#x27;s only charting radio hit, &quot;Never Say Never&quot;, which reached No. 27 on the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock charts in 1997.

That year the band toured the US with various acts including, Blur, The Wallflowers, and Counting Crows.

===Dissolution and Other Projects===
The group issued a formal statement announcing their disbandment in September 1997. Since that time, all the members of the band have kept active in the music business. Anna Waronker has contributed music to soundtracks and released her solo debut album, &quot;Anna&quot;, in 2002 on her own Five Foot Two Records label; she released her second solo album, &quot;California Fade&quot;, in 2011. Petra Haden has released two solo albums: 1999&#x27;s &quot;Imaginaryland&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Petra Haden Sings The Who Sell Out&quot; in which she reinvents The Who&#x27;s classic 1967 album as a cappella. In 2005, she joined The Decemberists as a full-time member, but no longer plays with the band. Petra Haden has also contributed vocals and violin to recordings by many artists including Green Day, Bill Frisell, Miss Murgatroid, and The Rentals. Rachel Haden has contributed vocals to albums by Jimmy Eat World, Say Anything, Ozma and Nada Surf, and was also a member of the reformed version of The Rentals (featuring ex-Weezer bassist Matt Sharp) for a brief period. Tony Maxwell has worked as a composer, most notably on the films &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot; and &quot;The Good Girl&quot; (both written by Mike White).

Anna Waronker and her band frequently play clubs in the Los Angeles area. Petra and Rachel have sporadically gigged with third sister Tanya (the three are triplets) as the Haden Triplets.

===Reunion===
On June 21, 2011, after a few months of the band having an official presence on Facebook, the band used their page to announce a reunion show on August 26 at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. A second show was added for the 28th due to demand; both shows sold out. Openers for the shows included Tenacious D and a Prince cover band led by Maya Rudolph, who like Petra and Rachel Haden was a member of The Rentals. The band announced additional reunion shows for 2012: Two shows at Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles on April 13 (the second show was added after the first sold out), and performances in Brooklyn, New York, on May 24–25, 2012, at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. The announcement for the Los Angeles shows stated that the band would be performing with an expanded string section, and would feature some songs never performed before.

On May 25, 2012, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; published an interview with Anna Waronker where she hinted that there may be new music from the band in the future. In 2017, Waronker, Rachel Haden and Maxwell indicated that they were in the process of recording a fourth album. Petra Haden declined to participate in the recording process, opting not to continue with the band.

On August 21, 2019, the band announced that their fourth studio album, &quot;Old LP&quot; would be released on October 4, 2019. A music video for &quot;Just the Way&quot; was released on October 2, 2019.

<doc id="552759" wikidata="Q16258024" url="?curid=552759" title="National school (Ireland)">
<text>In Ireland, a national school () is a type of primary school that is financed directly by the state, but typically administered jointly by the state, a patron body, and local representatives. In national schools, most major policies, such as the curriculum and teacher salaries and conditions, are managed by the state through the Department of Education. Minor policies of the school are managed by local people, sometimes directed by a member of the clergy, as representative of the patron, through a local &#x27;board of management&#x27;. Most primary schools in Ireland fall into this category, which is a pre-independence concept.

While there are other forms of primary school in Ireland, including a relatively small number of private denominational schools which do not receive state aid, there were just 34 such private primary schools in 2012, with a combined enrollment of 7,600 pupils. By comparison there were, as of 2019, over 3,200 national schools in Ireland with a combined enrollment of 567,000 pupils. In Northern Ireland, the equivalent to a national school is a primary school.

==History==
National schools, established by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland government, post the Stanley Letter of 1831, and were intended to be multi-denominational. The schools were controlled by a state body, the National Board of Education, with a six-member board consisting of two Roman Catholics, two Church of Ireland, and two Presbyterians.

In the national schools, there was to be strict delimitation between religious and non-religious education, where the teacher had to declare that religious education was beginning, hang a sign on the wall or door indicating that religious education was in process, and remove all religious symbols and objects from sight when religious education finished. Also, parents had the a notional right to remove their children from this period of religious education if it conflicted with their religious beliefs. Lastly, schools who failed to abide by these rules or who refused admissions of different faiths to the patron were denied state funding. These rules largely remain in place today, but are not consistently recognised by the state, the patron bodies, or the general public.

In the early nineteenth century, in a climate of animosity between the churches, the multi-denominational system was strongly opposed: the established church (Church of Ireland), though the church of the minority, held a special position and a right to government support in promoting Anglicanism. Both the Roman Catholic Church, which was emerging from a period of suppression in Ireland, and the Protestant Presbyterians, who had also suffered under the penal laws, had sought state support for schools of their own tradition. 

For example, James Doyle (Roman Catholic Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin) was an early proponent, seeking to improve on the informal hedge school system. Doyle spoke before a Parliamentary Committee as follows, &quot;&quot;I do not see how any man wishing well to the public peace, and who looks to Ireland as his country, can think that peace can be permanently established, or the prosperity of the country ever well secured, if children are separated at the commencement of life on account of their religious opinions&quot;. From a political point of view, Doyle believed that separate schools would endanger the public peace, which was not yet permanent. He dealt with the effect of separation on the children themselves by saying &quot;I do not know of any measures that would prepare the way for better feeling in Ireland than uniting children at an early age, and bringing them up in the same school, leading them to commune with one another and to form those little intimacies and friendships which subsist through life. Children thus united know and love each other as children brought up together always will and to separate them is I think, to destroy some of the finest feelings in the hearts of men&quot;&quot;.

In 1831, Edward Stanley (who later became the 14th Earl of Derby), Chief Secretary for Ireland, in the Stanley Letter to Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster, outlined the new state-supported system of primary education (this letter remains today the legal basis of the system). The two legal pillars of the national school system were to be (i) children of all religious denominations to be taught together in the same school, with (ii) separate religious instruction. There was to be no hint of proselytism in this new school system. The new system, initially well supported by the religious denominations, quickly lost support of the Churches. However, the population showed great enthusiasm and flocked to attend these new national schools. One of the civil servants managing implementation was Belfast-born Sir Alexander Macdonnell, 1st Baronet. 

In the second half of the nineteenth century, first the Catholic Church, and later the Protestant churches conceded to the state, and accepted the &quot;all religious denominations together&quot; legal position. Where possible, parents sent their children of a national school under the local management of their particular Church. The result was that by the end of the nineteenth century the system had become increasingly denominational, with individuals choosing to attend schools primarily catering to children of their own religion. However, the legal position &quot;de jure&quot;, that all national schools are multi-denominational, remains to this day. Although, since the establishment of the Free State consistent pressure has been exerted by the Catholic Church to drop the multi-denominational legal position, this has never been conceded by the state. A report was submitted to government in 1953 showing more than 90% of the schools were attended by only one denomination – that most national schools were &quot;de facto&quot; denominational. From 1965, changes in the &#x27;Rules for National Schools&#x27; allowed for the integration of religious education into the curriculum. Today, following many years of immigration, a majority of national schools cater for more than one religion. Today national schools are both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; multi-denominational.

==Terminology==
While there is no prescribed naming scheme for national schools, initials (within the name) are sometimes used to describe the type of school it is. For example, &#x27;GNS&#x27; (as an abbreviation for Girls&#x27; National School) may denote a girl-only single gender school. Similarly, &#x27;BNS&#x27; is used as an abbreviation for Boys&#x27; National School. &#x27;SN&#x27;, an abbreviation for the Irish language term &quot;Scoil Naisiúnta&quot; may sometimes appear before the name of the school (rather than after it).

While national-school teachers would sometimes historically use the post-nominal letters &#x27;N.T.&#x27;, this is no longer common.

The practice of affixing honorific titles to the names of jazz musicians goes back to New Orleans at the start of the 20th century, before the genre was commonly known as &quot;jazz&quot;.

==History==
In New York City in the 1920s, Paul Whiteman was billed as the &quot;King of Jazz&quot;. His popular band with many hit records arguably played more jazz-influenced popular music than jazz &quot;per se&quot;, but to the dismay of many later jazz fans, Whiteman&#x27;s self-conferred moniker stuck, and a film &quot;The King of Jazz&quot; starring Whiteman and his band appeared in 1930. The &quot;King of Jazz&quot; title was a publicity stunt in 1923 by an instrument manufacturer that Whiteman endorsed.

<doc id="552779" wikidata="Q381685" url="?curid=552779" title="Dylan Moran">
<text>Dylan William Moran ( ; born ) is an Irish comedian, writer, actor and artist. He is best known for his observational comedy, the comedy series &quot;Black Books&quot; (which he co-wrote and starred in), and his work with Simon Pegg in films such as &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;. He was also one of two lead characters in the Irish black comedy film &quot;A Film with Me in It&quot;.

He is a regular performer at national and international comedy festivals such as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Just for Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and the Kilkenny Comedy Festival. In 2007, he was voted the 17th greatest stand-up comedian by Channel 4; in the updated 2010 list, he was ranked as the 14th greatest.

==Early life==
Dylan William Moran was born in 1971 in Navan, County Meath. He attended St Patrick&#x27;s Classical School, where he experimented early on with stand-up alongside fellow comedians Tommy Tiernan and Hector Ó hEochagáin; he left with his Leaving Certificate at age 16. He has said that he then spent four years unemployed &quot;drinking and writing bad poetry&quot;. He worked as a florist at some point, but hated it and quit after a week. He has said that he was very passionate about rugby and enjoyed watching many games when he was growing up, but has since lost interest and has none in any other sport either. He nonetheless makes an effort to keep somewhat abreast of popular sport, explaining: &quot;otherwise nobody would talk to me, as its very hard to find anyone else who&#x27;s not rabid about sport.&quot;

==Career==
Moran came to comedy at age 20 after watching Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon and other comedians perform at Dublin&#x27;s Comedy Cellar, a fifty-seater comedy club with no microphone, in the basement of The International Bar on South Wicklow Street. He began his stand up there in 1992 and got a good reception. In 1993, he won the So You Think You&#x27;re Funny award at the Edinburgh Festival. He went on to become the second youngest person to win the Perrier Comedy Award in 1996 at the Edinburgh Festival at age 24. &quot;Gurgling For Money&quot; was Moran&#x27;s first major one-man stand-up UK tour in 1997. He went on to perform at many other festivals including the Hay Festival, Montreal comedy festival, Vancouver Comedy Festival and the Edinburgh Festival. Between 1995 and 1997 Moran wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

Moran won his first major television role in 1998, playing Ian Lyons in the BBC 2 sitcom &quot;How Do You Want Me?&quot;, opposite Charlotte Coleman. He went on to appear in a small role in the 1999 movie &quot;Notting Hill&quot; as a shoplifter. In 2000, &quot;Black Books&quot; was launched on Channel 4. The sitcom, about depressed, bitter, alcoholic, chain-smoking and misanthropic book shop owner Bernard Black, was based on a dream Moran had in the mid-eighties during a weekend away in Limerick. The first series was written with fellow Irishman Graham Linehan, and produced by Mark Buckley and Albert Kenny of Kenley Studios. The second series was televised in 2002, and the third, which aired in 2004, was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and fans alike. In the same year Moran appeared in his first major film role, playing David in the horror comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;.

Moran toured his stand-up shows &quot;Monster I&quot; and &quot;Monster II&quot; in 2004, including performances in New York and Milan, as well as a tour across Britain and Ireland which culminated in a week-long run at London&#x27;s Palace Theatre, before two shows at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street, and finally an appearance at the Hay Festival. The tour was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as a &quot;masterclass of comic charisma: swinging from topic to topic in a manner seemingly spontaneous but actually tightly organised&quot;.

A live DVD of the &quot;Monster II&quot; tour, filmed on 28 May at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street, was released that year, as Moran&#x27;s first live stand-up DVD. After a successful run in New York City in 2004 as part of the British/Irish Comedy Invasion (including performances by top British and Irish comedians such as Eddie Izzard, fellow &quot;Black Books&quot; star Bill Bailey and Irish comedian Tommy Tiernan) Moran returned to New York for a month-long run at the Village Theatre. He then performed a two-week London West End run at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, 1–13 November 2004.

His third major tour, &quot;Like, Totally&quot;, opened at the Buxton Opera House on 3 May 2005, and as with his previous tours the stand-up routine was accompanied by projected cartoons drawn by Moran. A DVD of the tour was released in December 2005. Moran appeared as the character of Gordon in the comedy film &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;, released in September 2007 which cast Moran as the best friend to protagonist Dennis, played by Simon Pegg. Moran had previously played an adversary to Pegg&#x27;s title character in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;.

In June 2008, Moran appeared with Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon and Tommy Tiernan at Liverpool&#x27;s Echo Arena in &#x27;The Three Fellas&#x27;, a one-off comedy event, part of the city&#x27;s European Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. Between October and December 2008, Moran embarked on &quot;What It Is&quot;, a new UK tour starting at the Grand Opera House in York, and ending at Oxford&#x27;s New Theatre. The tour was extended into 2009 and has now been released on DVD.

A compilation DVD of highlights from Moran&#x27;s three previous stand-up shows was made available in November 2010 called &quot;Dylan Moran: Aim Low&quot;. &quot;Yeah, Yeah&quot;, a stand-up tour of Scandinavia, the Baltic states, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK began in April 2011.

In 2012, Moran performed shows in Russia (following two sold-out performances in neighbouring Estonia). The show&#x27;s promoters indicated that they believed it to be the first time an Irish stand-up had performed live in a Russian venue; his routine mocked Russia&#x27;s new law banning &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot; and jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

In 2014, Moran wrote a pilot for ABC about &quot;news media and conflict, war zones and cable news&quot;. The channel decided not to go ahead with the show but may possibly sell it to another network. The same year he appeared in John Michael McDonagh&#x27;s film &quot;Calvary&quot;. The following July he took his stand-up show &quot;Off the Hook&quot; to South Africa for the first time, performing three sold-out shows at the country&#x27;s National Arts Festival.

In 2018, Moran took his latest standup show Dr Cosmos on tour, starting with 42 dates in the UK before touring Europe and Australia in 2019. The DVD was released in 2021.

In June 2019, Moran reported he was developing a &quot;small format&quot; show for the BBC. Moran finished the series during the COVID-19 pandemic, when live performances were effectively cancelled. The series, &quot;Stuck&quot;, starred Moran and Morgana Robinson and was notable for episodes being only fifteen minutes long in keeping with Moran&#x27;s belief that shorter content is trending. It aired on BBC Two in 2022.

Moran began touring his most recent standup show, &quot;We Got This&quot;, in November 2021, touring Ireland and the UK in 2022 and Europe, Australia and New Zealand in 2023.

==Awards and commendations==
At the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he won the &#x27;So You Think You&#x27;re Funny? Award&#x27; in 1993, and the Perrier Award in 1996. He later dismissed the latter as &quot;a load of media rubbish,&quot; stating Bill Bailey deserved it more.

A popular poll commissioned by Channel 4 ranked him the 14th-greatest comedy stand-up. Moran was declared &quot;the greatest comedian, living or dead&quot; by the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; in July 2007. He has also twice won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Situation Comedy, both for &quot;Black Books&quot;.

==Personal life==
Moran married his wife Elaine in 1997. They lived in Edinburgh with their two children. In 2022, Moran and Elaine divorced.

Moran quit smoking in 2014 and became teetotal in 2018, but has since resumed drinking.

<text>In computer science, a selection algorithm is an algorithm for finding the formula_1th smallest value in a collection of ordered values, such as numbers. The value that it finds is called the order statistic. Selection includes as special cases the problems of finding the minimum, median, and maximum element in the collection. Selection algorithms include quickselect, and the median of medians algorithm. When applied to a collection of formula_2 values, these algorithms take linear time, formula_3 as expressed using big O notation. For data that is already structured, faster algorithms may be possible; as an extreme case, selection in an already-sorted array takes 

==Problem statement==
An algorithm for the selection problem takes as input a collection of values, and a It outputs the smallest of these values, or, in some versions of the problem, a collection of the formula_1 smallest values. For this to be well-defined, it should be possible to sort the values into an order from smallest to largest; for instance, they may be integers, floating-point numbers, or some other kind of object with a numeric key. However, they are not assumed to have been already sorted. Often, selection algorithms are restricted to a comparison-based model of computation, as in comparison sort algorithms, where the algorithm has access to a comparison operation that can determine the relative ordering of any two values, but may not perform any other kind of arithmetic operations on these values.

To simplify the problem, some works on this problem assume that the values are all distinct from each or that some consistent tie-breaking method has been used to assign an ordering to pairs of items with the same value as each other. Another variation in the problem definition concerns the numbering of the ordered values: is the smallest value obtained by as in zero-based numbering of arrays, or is it obtained by following the usual English-language conventions for the smallest, second-smallest, etc.? This article follows the conventions used by Cormen et al., according to which all values are distinct and the minimum value is obtained from 

With these conventions, the maximum value, among a collection of formula_2 values, is obtained by When formula_2 is an odd number, the median of the collection is obtained by When formula_2 is even, there are two choices for the median, obtained by rounding this choice of formula_1 down or up, respectively: the &quot;lower median&quot; with formula_9 and the &quot;upper median&quot; with 

==Algorithms==
===Sorting and heapselect===
As a baseline algorithm, selection of the smallest value in a collection of values can be performed by the following two steps:
* Sort the collection
* If the output of the sorting algorithm is an array, retrieve its element; otherwise, scan the sorted sequence to find the element.
The time for this method is dominated by the sorting step, which requires formula_10 time using a Even when integer sorting algorithms may be used, these are generally slower than the linear time that may be achieved using specialized selection algorithms. Nevertheless, the simplicity of this approach makes it attractive, especially when a highly-optimized sorting routine is provided as part of a runtime library, but a selection algorithm is not. For inputs of moderate size, sorting can be faster than non-random selection algorithms, because of the smaller constant factors in its running This method also produces a sorted version of the collection, which may be useful for other later computations, and in particular for selection with other choices 

For a sorting algorithm that generates one item at a time, such as selection sort, the scan can be done in tandem with the sort, and the sort can be terminated once the element has been found. One possible design of a consolation bracket in a single-elimination tournament, in which the teams who lost to the eventual winner play another mini-tournament to determine second place, can be seen as an instance of this Applying this optimization to heapsort produces the heapselect algorithm, which can select the smallest value in This is fast when formula_1 is small relative but degenerates to formula_12 for larger values such as the choice formula_9 used for median finding.

===Pivoting===
Many methods for selection are based on choosing a special &quot;pivot&quot; element from the input, and using comparisons with this element to divide the remaining formula_14 input values into two subsets: the set formula_15 of elements less than the pivot, and the set formula_16 of elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm can then determine where the smallest value is to be found, based on a comparison of formula_1 with the sizes of these sets. In particular, the smallest value is and can be found recursively by applying the same selection algorithm then the smallest value is the pivot, and it can be returned immediately. In the remaining case, the smallest value is and more specifically it is the element in position formula_18 It can be found by applying a selection algorithm recursively, seeking the value in this position 

As with the related pivoting-based quicksort algorithm, the partition of the input into formula_15 and formula_16 may be done by making new collections for these sets, or by a method that partitions a given list or array data type in-place. Details vary depending on how the input collection is The time to compare the pivot against all the other values However, pivoting methods differ in how they choose the pivot, which affects how big the subproblems in each recursive call will be. The efficiency of these methods depends greatly on the choice of the pivot. If the pivot is chosen badly, the running time of this method can be as slow 
*If the pivot were exactly at the median of the input, then each recursive call would have at most half as many values as the previous call, and the total times would add in a geometric series However, finding the median is itself a selection problem, on the entire original input. Trying to find it by a recursive call to a selection algorithm would lead to an infinite recursion, because the problem size would not decrease in each 
*Quickselect chooses the pivot uniformly at random from the input values. It can be described as a prune and search algorithm, a variant of quicksort, with the same pivoting strategy, but where quicksort makes two recursive calls to sort the two subcollections formula_15 quickselect only makes one of these two calls. Its expected time For any constant formula_22, the probability that its number of comparisons exceeds formula_23 is superexponentially small 
*The Floyd–Rivest algorithm, a variation of quickselect, chooses a pivot by randomly sampling a subset of formula_24 data values, for some sample and then recursively selecting two elements somewhat above and below position formula_25 of the sample to use as pivots. With this choice, it is likely that formula_1 is sandwiched between the two pivots, so that after pivoting only a small number of data values between the pivots are left for a recursive call. This method can achieve an expected number of comparisons that is In their original work, Floyd and Rivest claimed that the formula_27 term could be made as small as formula_28 by a recursive sampling scheme, but the correctness of their analysis has been Instead, more rigorous analysis has shown that a version of their algorithm achieves formula_29 for this Although the usual analysis of both quickselect and the Floyd–Rivest algorithm assumes the use of a true random number generator, a version of the Floyd–Rivest algorithm using a pseudorandom number generator seeded with only logarithmically many true random bits has been proven to run in linear time with high probability.

*The median of medians method partitions the input into sets of five elements, and uses some other non-recursive method to find the median of each of these sets in constant time per set. It then recursively calls itself to find the median of these formula_30 medians. Using the resulting median of medians as the pivot produces a partition with Thus, a problem on formula_2 elements is reduced to two recursive problems on formula_30 elements (to find the pivot) and at most formula_33 elements (after the pivot is used). The total size of these two recursive subproblems is at allowing the total time to be analyzed as a geometric series adding Unlike quickselect, this algorithm is deterministic, not It was the first linear-time deterministic selection algorithm and is commonly taught in undergraduate algorithms classes as an example of a divide and conquer that does not divide into two equal However, the high constant factors in its formula_3 time bound make it slower than quickselect in and slower even than sorting for inputs of moderate 
*Hybrid algorithms such as introselect can be used to achieve the practical performance of quickselect with a fallback to medians of medians guaranteeing worst-case formula_3 

===Factories===
The deterministic selection algorithms with the smallest known numbers of comparisons, for values of formula_1 that are far from formula_37 are based on the concept of &quot;factories&quot;, introduced in 1976 by Arnold Schönhage, Mike Paterson, and These are methods that build partial orders of certain specified types, on small subsets of input values, by using comparisons to combine smaller partial orders. As a very simple example, one type of factory can take as input a sequence of single-element partial orders, compare pairs of elements from these orders, and produce as output a sequence of two-element totally ordered sets. The elements used as the inputs to this factory could either be input values that have not been compared with anything yet, or &quot;waste&quot; values produced by other factories. The goal of a factory-based algorithm is to combine together different factories, with the outputs of some factories going to the inputs of others, in order to eventually obtain a partial order in which one element (the smallest) is larger than some formula_38 other elements and smaller than another formula_39 others. A careful design of these factories leads to an algorithm that, when applied to median-finding, uses at most formula_40 comparisons. For other values the number of comparisons is 

===Parallel algorithms===
Parallel algorithms for selection have been studied since 1975, when Leslie Valiant introduced the parallel comparison tree model for analyzing these algorithms, and proved that in this model selection using a linear number of comparisons requires formula_41 parallel steps, even for selecting the minimum or Researchers later found parallel algorithms for selection in formula_42 steps, matching this In a randomized parallel comparison tree model it is possible to perform selection in a bounded number of steps and a linear number of On the more realistic parallel RAM model of computing, with exclusive read exclusive write memory access, selection can be performed in time formula_43 with formula_44 processors, which is optimal both in time and in the number of With concurrent memory access, slightly faster parallel time is possible in and the formula_45 term in the time bound can be replaced 

===Sublinear data structures===
When data is already organized into a data structure, it may be possible to perform selection in an amount of time that is sublinear in the number of values. As a simple case of this, for data already sorted into an array, selecting the element may be performed by a single array lookup, in constant For values organized into a two-dimensional array of with sorted rows and columns, selection may be performed in time or faster when formula_1 is small relative to the array For a collection of formula_47 one-dimensional sorted arrays, with formula_48 items less than the selected item in the array, the time is 

Selection from data in a binary heap takes This is independent of the size formula_2 of the heap, and faster than the formula_50 time bound that would be obtained from This same method can be applied more generally to data organized as any kind of heap-ordered tree (a tree in which each node stores one value in which the parent of each non-root node has a smaller value than its child). This method of performing selection in a heap has been applied to problems of listing multiple solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph, by defining a state space of solutions in the form of an implicitly defined heap-ordered tree, and then applying this selection algorithm to this In the other direction, linear time selection algorithms have been used as a subroutine in a priority queue data structure related to the heap, improving the time for extracting its item from formula_43 to here formula_52 is the 

For a collection of data values undergoing dynamic insertions and deletions, the order statistic tree augments a self-balancing binary search tree structure with a constant amount of additional information per tree node, allowing insertions, deletions, and selection queries that ask for the element in the current set to all be performed in formula_43 time per Going beyond the comparison model of computation, faster times per operation are possible for values that are small integers, on which binary arithmetic operations are It is not possible for a streaming algorithm with memory sublinear in both formula_2 and formula_1 to solve selection queries exactly for dynamic data, but the count–min sketch can be used to solve selection queries approximately, by finding a value whose position in the ordering of the elements (if it were added to them) would be within formula_56 steps of formula_1, for a sketch whose size is within logarithmic factors of formula_58.

== Lower bounds ==
The formula_3 running time of the selection algorithms described above is necessary, because a selection algorithm that can handle inputs in an arbitrary order must take that much time to look at all of its inputs. If any one of its input values is not compared, that one value could be the one that should have been selected, and the algorithm can be made to produce an incorrect answer. Beyond this simple argument, there has been a significant amount of research on the exact number of comparisons needed for selection, both in the randomized and deterministic cases.

Selecting the minimum of formula_2 values requires formula_14 comparisons, because the formula_14 values that are not selected must each have been determined to be non-minimal, by being the largest in some comparison, and no two of these values can be largest in the same comparison. The same argument applies symmetrically to selecting the 

The next simplest case is selecting the second-smallest. After several incorrect attempts, the first tight lower bound on this case was published in 1964 by Soviet mathematician Sergey Kislitsyn. It can be shown by observing that selecting the second-smallest also requires distinguishing the smallest value from the rest, and by considering the number formula_63 of comparisons involving the smallest value that an algorithm for this problem makes. Each of the formula_63 items that were compared to the smallest value is a candidate for second-smallest, and formula_65 of these values must be found larger than another value in a second comparison in order to rule them out as second-smallest.
With formula_14 values being the larger in at least one comparison, and formula_65 values being the larger in at least two comparisons, there are a total of at least formula_68 comparisons. An adversary argument, in which the outcome of each comparison is chosen in order to maximize formula_63 (subject to consistency with at least one possible ordering) rather than by the numerical values of the given items, shows that it is possible to force formula_63 to be Therefore, the worst-case number of comparisons needed to select the second smallest the same number that would be obtained by holding a single-elimination tournament with a run-off tournament among the values that lost to the smallest value. However, the expected number of comparisons of a randomized selection algorithm can be better than this bound; for instance, selecting the second-smallest of six elements requires seven comparisons in the worst case, but may be done by a randomized algorithm with an expected number of 

More generally, selecting the element out of formula_2 requires at least formula_72 comparisons, in the average case, matching the number of comparisons of the Floyd–Rivest algorithm up to its formula_27 term. The argument is made directly for deterministic algorithms, with a number of comparisons that is averaged over all possible permutations of the input By Yao&#x27;s principle, it also applies to the expected number of comparisons for a randomized algorithm on its worst-case 

For deterministic algorithms, it has been shown that selecting the element requires formula_74 comparisons, where formula_75 is the The special case of median-finding has a slightly larger lower bound on the number of comparisons, for 

== Exact numbers of comparisons ==

Knuth supplies the following triangle of numbers summarizing pairs of formula_2 and formula_1 for which the exact number of comparisons needed by an optimal selection algorithm is known. The row of the triangle (starting with formula_78 in the top row) gives the numbers of comparisons for inputs of formula_2 values, and the number within each row gives the number of comparisons needed to select the smallest value from an input of that size. The rows are symmetric because selecting the smallest requires exactly the same number of comparisons, in the worst case, as selecting the 




Most, but not all, of the entries on the left half of each row can be found using the formula formula_80 This describes the number of comparisons made by a method of Abdollah Hadian and Milton Sobel, related to heapselect, that finds the smallest value using a single-elimination tournament and then repeatedly uses a smaller tournament among the values eliminated by the eventual tournament winners to find the next successive values until reaching the smallest. Some of the larger entries were proven to be optimal using a computer search.

== Language support ==
Very few languages have built-in support for general selection, although many provide facilities for finding the smallest or largest element of a list. A notable exception is the Standard Template Library for C++, which provides a templated codice_1 method with a guarantee of expected linear time.

Python&#x27;s standard library includes codice_2 and codice_3 functions for returning the smallest or largest elements from a collection, in sorted order. The implementation maintains a binary heap, limited to holding formula_1 elements, and initialized to the first formula_1 elements in the collection. Then, each subsequent item of the collection may replace the largest or smallest element in the heap if it is smaller or larger than this element. The algorithm&#x27;s memory usage is superior to heapselect (the former only holds formula_1 elements in memory at a time while the latter requires manipulating the entire dataset into memory). Running time depends on data ordering. The best case is formula_84 for already sorted data. The worst-case is formula_85 for reverse sorted data. In average cases, there are likely to be few heap updates and most input elements are processed with only a single comparison. For example, extracting the 100 largest or smallest values out of 10,000,000 random inputs makes 10,009,401 comparisons on average.

Since 2017, Matlab has included codice_4 and codice_5 functions, which return the maximal (minimal) formula_1 values in a vector as well as their indices. The Matlab documentation does not specify which algorithm these functions use or what their running 

== History==
Quickselect was presented without analysis by Tony Hoare and first analyzed in a 1971 technical report by The first known linear time deterministic selection algorithm is the median of medians method, published in 1973 by Manuel Blum, Robert W. Floyd, Vaughan Pratt, Ron Rivest, and Robert Tarjan. They trace the formulation of the selection problem to work of Charles L. Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll) who in 1883 pointed out that the usual design of single-elimination sports tournaments does not guarantee that the second-best player wins second place, and to work of Hugo Steinhaus circa 1930, who followed up this same line of thought by asking for a tournament design that can make this guarantee, with a minimum number of games played (that is,

<text>Bijeljina () is a city and municipality in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the provincial center of Semberija, a geographic region in the country&#x27;s northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Bijeljina is located in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s northeast, bound by the Sava and Drina rivers, extending over the Majevica mountains and covering a land mass of 734 km2. It is a part of the entity of Republika Srpska and is the center of the Semberija region. Semberija is a flat region with a fertile land ideal for agriculture. Due to this, Bijeljina is a major place for food production and trade, particularly wheat and vegetables.

===Climate===
==History==
===Prehistory and Antiquity===
The earliest established evidence of human life in the area of today&#x27;s Bijeljina date from the New Stone Age (5000–3000BC). Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures – Vučedol, Kostolac and Baden culture.

===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===
The oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of the Bistrik channel, between the villages of Batković and Ostojićevo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Oraščić, remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site Čelopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and iron tools were manufactured. The oldest religious building, the Tavna Monastery was built in the Middle Ages. The region was incorporated into the Bosnian banate during the reign of Stephen Kotromanić. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina.

The first documented mention of the name Bijeljina occurred in 1446. The city fully fell to the Ottomans in 1530. Following the Great Turkish War, it was incorporated into Austrian possession before being retaken by the Ottomans in 1739. Many of the settlements were decimated as a result of unsuccessful Serb rebellions against the occupation.

Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina rule lasted from 1878 until 1918. The name Bijeljina was only used after 1918 and World War I. During Austro-Hungarian rule, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.

===Modern history===
In 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school Jovan Dučić, famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893 and 1895.

In front of City Hall is a statue of King Peter I of Serbia, who ruled the Kingdom of Serbia between 1903 and 1918. During the Second World War, the Ustaša removed it. After World War II, the communist government refused to return the monument. The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.

====Bosnian War====

In September 1991, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the Bosnian referendum on independence was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats. Local Bosniak Patriotic League had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A massacre was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by Serb paramilitary groups. The majority of those killed were Bosniaks (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko&#x27;s Chetniks and by the Serb Volunteer Guard (SDG, also known as Arkan&#x27;s Tigers), a Serbia-based paramilitary group under the command of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA).

The village of Batković in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the Batković camp, believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the Bosnian War. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996. The prisoners were predominantly ethnic Bosniaks, who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed. A &quot;State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population&quot; or &quot;Commission for the Exchange of Population&quot; was created and headed by Vojkan Đurković, a Major in the SDG.

====Post-war period====
Post-war development of Bijeljina is experienced in the late 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. After a population boom due to war events and population saturation and insufficient capacity of the city that was built in less need, today there is re-building of Bijeljina with new settlements, roads, schools, universities, and cultural institutions.

The Serb Democratic Party (SDS) governed Bijeljina for 28 years since 1992. Following the 2018 Bosnian general election, in March 2020 mayor Mićo Mićić (governing the city since 2004) left the party to found the Party of Democratic Srpska of Semberija (SDSS) and signed a coalition agreement with Milorad Dodik&#x27;s SNSD. In June 2020, SDSS and SNSD put SDS in minority in the local council. At the 2020 Bosnian municipal elections, SDS&#x27;s Ljubiša Petrović became the new mayor, succeeding Mićić.

==Architecture==

Atik Mosque was built between 1520 and 1566, during the period of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. It was used as a defensive bastion in the Austro-Turkish War and converted to a catholic church by Austrians during 1718-1739. After the Treaty of Belgrade, it reverted back to the mosque, and went through several renovations in the 19th and early 20th century. The mosque was completely destroyed on 13 March 1993 and rebuilt where it stood before.

Serbian Orthodox Church (&quot;Svetog Đorđa&quot;) Saint George is located at the site of an older church, which was first mentioned in 1735. The current building dates back from the early 1870s and represents a mix of Russian and Byzantine style, with a dome and a tall tower.

Semberija Museum is located in a historic building and has four exhibition halls. The exhibitions span a vast historical period, ranging from the Neolithic, through the Roman era and the Middle Ages, all the way to the 20th century.

Basil of Ostrog Monastery in the center of Bijeljina is a newly built monastery (2001) dedicated to St Basil of Ostrog. The bell tower with a clock of over 30 meters dominates the surroundings and is a symbol of the monastery. The monastery includes a museum, dining room, library, hermitages for monks. Inside, the temple is painted with magnificent frescoes. Particularly valuable is a copy of Trojeručica miraculous icon, the gift from Hilandar monastery.

Filip Višnjić Library is the oldest cultural institution in Bijeljina - founded in 1932 thanks to prominent people including Dr Vojislav Kecmanović, Dr Joakim Perendija, and Professor Nikola Mačkić among others. It played a major role in raising the cultural level in Semberija and has over 120,000 books.

The Tavna Monastery is located in the southern part of the Bijeljina municipality. The date of foundation is hidden somewhere in the shadows of the far past. The chronicles of monasteries Tronoša and Peć say it was built by Stefan Dragutin&#x27;s sons Vladislav and Uroš II Milutin. Stefan Dragutin was the King of Serbia from 1276 to 1282 and king of Srem from 1282 to 1316. The present church of monastery Tavna is built in the same place as the original one. The Tavna Monastery is older than the other monasteries in the region such as Ozrena, Liplja, Vozuce and Gostovica. Tavna was damaged in the first years of Turkish rule, but was restored by the people. This was not the only time the monastery was damaged. It was damaged many times during the Turkish period and also during World War Two. Between 1941 and 1945, Tavna was bombed by the Ustase. One of the gravestones says &quot;&quot;Zdravko Jovanovic Killed 1943 by the Ustasa Blue Division protecting and defending the monastery&quot;.&quot; After WWII Tavna was rebuilt.

The first primary school in Bijeljina was opened in 1938. After World War II, changes were made to the school system, and in 1951 the first elementary school was opened. In 1956, a second elementary school was opened. The third and fourth elementary schools opened in 1959 and 1966, respectively.

<doc id="552804" wikidata="Q1330833" url="?curid=552804" title="Omega Workshops">
<text>The Omega Workshops Ltd. was a design enterprise founded by members of the Bloomsbury Group and established in July 1913. It was located at 33 Fitzroy Square in London, and was founded with the intention of providing graphic expression to the essence of the Bloomsbury ethos. The Workshops were also closely associated with the Hogarth Press and the artist and critic Roger Fry, who was the principal figure behind the project, believed that artists could design, produce and sell their own works, and that writers could also be their own printers and publishers. The Directors of the firm were Fry, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell.

==Beginnings==
Fry aimed to remove what he considered to be the false divisions between the decorative and fine arts, and to give his artist friends an additional income opportunity in designing furniture, textiles and other household accessories. Fry was keen to encourage a Post-Impressionist influence in designs produced for Omega. However, Cubist and Fauvist influences are also apparent, particularly in many of the textile designs.

To ensure items were bought only for the quality of the work, and not the reputation of the artist, Fry insisted works be shown anonymously, marked only with the letter omega. The products were in general expensive, and aimed at an exclusive market.

==Designers and manufacturers==
In addition to offering a wide range of individual products, such as painted furniture, painted murals, mosaics, stained glass, and textiles, Omega Workshops offered interior design themes for various living spaces. A commission was taken to decorate a room for the 1913 Ideal Home Exhibition, and an illustrated catalogue, including text written by Fry, was published in autumn 1914.

Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant produced designs for Omega, and Wyndham Lewis was initially part of the operation. Lewis, however, split off at an early stage, taking with him several other participants to start the rival decorative workshop Rebel Art Centre after accusing Fry of misappropriating a commission to decorate a room at the Ideal Home Exhibition in the autumn of 1913. In October 1913, Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, Edward Wadsworth and Cuthbert Hamilton announced their resignation from Omega in a letter, known as the &#x27;Round Robin&#x27;, to its shareholders and patrons. This letter contained accusations particularly against Fry, criticising the workshop&#x27;s products and ideology. This split led to the formation not only of the Rebel Art Centre, but also of the Vorticist movement.

Most manufacturing for Omega was outsourced to professional craftsmen, such as J. Kallenborn &amp; Sons of Stanhope Street, London, for marquetry furniture and Dryad Limited of Leicester for tall cane-seat chairs. A company in France was used to manufacture early printed linens.

In the autumn of 1913 Fry, who also created the designs for Omega&#x27;s tall cane-seat chairs, started designing and making pottery. After he considered book design and publishing in July 1915, the superintendent of printing at Central School of Arts and Crafts collaborated with Omega in designing four books that were later outsourced for printing. The management of the Omega Workshop was passed to Winifred Gill from 1914 as the men started to become involved in the First World War.

One artist exhibitions included those of Edward McKnight Kauffer, Alvaro Guevara, Mikhail Larionov and Vanessa Bell&#x27;s first solo exhibition in 1916.

The range of products continued to increase throughout Omega Workshops&#x27; six-year existence, and in April 1915 Vanessa Bell began using Omega fabrics in dress design, after which dressmaking became a successful part of the business.

Edward Wolfe worked at the Omega Workshops, hand-painting candle-shades and trays, and decorating furniture. Wolfe, who died in 1982, was one of the last of the Bloomsbury painters.

In January 1918, Omega were commissioned to design sets and costumes in the Israel Zangwill play &quot;Too Much Money&quot;.

==Closure and legacy==
Omega closed in 1919, after a clearance sale, and was officially liquidated on 24 July 1920. A series of poor financial decisions and internal conflicts all contributed to its decline. At the time of its closure, Fry was the only remaining original member working regularly at the workshop. Despite this, Omega became influential in interior design in the 1920s.

A revival of interest in Omega designs in the 1980s led to a reassessment of the place of the Bloomsbury Group in visual arts.

<doc id="552805" wikidata="Q458265" url="?curid=552805" title="The Almanac Singers">
<text>The Almanac Singers was an American New York City-based folk music group, active between 1940 and 1943, founded by Millard Lampell, Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, and were joined by Woody Guthrie. The group specialized in topical songs, mostly songs advocating an anti-war, anti-racism and pro-union philosophy. They were part of the Popular Front, an alliance of liberals and leftists, including the Communist Party USA (whose slogan, under their leader Earl Browder, was &quot;Communism is twentieth century Americanism&quot;), who had vowed to put aside their differences in order to fight fascism and promote racial and religious inclusiveness and workers&#x27; rights. The Almanac Singers felt strongly that songs could help achieve these goals.

==History==
Cultural historian Michael Denning writes, &quot;The base of the Popular Front was labor movement, the organization of millions of industrial workers into the new unions of the CIO. For this was the age of the CIO, the years that one historian has called &#x27;the largest sustained surge of worker organization in American history&#x27;&quot;. &quot;By the early 1940s,&quot; he continues, &quot;the CIO was dominated by new unions in the metalworking industries--the United Autoworkers, the United Steel Workers, and the United Electrical Workers--and &#x27;industrial unionism&#x27; was not simply a kind of unionism but a kind of social reconstruction&quot;. It is in the context of this social movement that the story of the Almanac Singers, which formed in early 1941, ought to be seen.

In late 1940 and early 1941 (before America entered World War II) rearmament was putting an end to a decade of unemployment; and labor was at its most militant. As the CIO fought racial discrimination in hiring, it had to confront deep racial divides in its own membership, particularly in the UAW plants in Detroit where white workers sometimes struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs. It also worked on this issue in shipyards in Alabama, mass transit in Philadelphia, and steel plants in Baltimore. The CIO leadership, particularly those in more left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers, the UAW, the NMU and the Transport Workers, undertook serious efforts to suppress hate strikes and to educate their membership. Those unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the timidity and racism of the AFL.

Almanac members Millard Lampell, Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, and Woody Guthrie began playing together informally in 1940 or 1941. Pete Seeger and Guthrie had met at Will Geer&#x27;s Grapes of Wrath Evening, a benefit for displaced migrant workers, in March 1940. That year, Seeger joined Guthrie on a trip to Texas and California to visit Guthrie&#x27;s relatives. Hays and Lampell had rented a New York City apartment together in October 1940, and on his return Seeger moved in with them. They called their apartment Almanac House, and it became a center for leftist intellectuals as well as crash pad for folksingers, including (in 1942) Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.

Ed Cray says that Hays and Seeger&#x27;s first paying gig was in January 1941 at a fund-raising benefit for Spanish Civil War Loyalists at the Jade Mountain restaurant in New York City. According to a 1965 interview with Lee Hays by Richard Reuss, Seeger, Hays, and Lampell sang at an American Youth Congress held at Turner&#x27;s Arena in Washington, D.C., in February 1941, at which sponsors had requested songs constructed around the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Lend or Lease our Bases&quot; and &quot;Jim Crow must Go&quot;. Shortly after this, they decided to call themselves the Almanacs. They chose the name because Lee Hays had said that back home in Arkansas farmers had only two books in their houses: the Bible, to guide and prepare them for life in the next world, and the Almanac, to tell them about conditions in this one.&quot;

Performers who sang with the group at various times included Sis Cunningham, (John) Peter Hawes and his brother Baldwin &quot;Butch&quot; Hawes, Bess Lomax Hawes (wife of Butch and sister of Alan Lomax), Cisco Houston, Arthur Stern, Josh White, Jackie (Gibson) Alper, Burl Ives, (Hiram) Jaime Lowden and Sam Gary.

They invented a driving, energetic performing style, based on what they felt was the best of American country string band music, black and white. They wore street clothes, which was unheard of in an era when entertainers routinely wore formal, night-club attire, and they invited the audience to join in the singing. The Almanacs had many gigs playing at parties, rallies, benefits, unions meetings, and informal &quot;hootenannies&quot;, a term Seeger and Guthrie learned on an Almanac tour of Portland and Washington.

On May day of 1941, they entertained a rally of 20,000 striking transit workers in Madison Square Garden, where they introduced the song &quot;Talking Union&quot; and participated in a dramatic sketch with the young actress Carol Channing.

== Recordings and Reds ==
The Almanacs&#x27; first record release, an album of three 78s called &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot;, written to protest the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, the first peacetime draft in U.S. history. Recorded in February or March 1941 and issued in May, it comprised four songs written by Millard Lampell and two by Seeger and Hays (including &quot;Plow Under&quot;) that followed the Communist Party line (after the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), urging non-intervention in World War II. It was produced by the founder of Keynote Records, Eric Bernay. Bernay, who owned a small record store, was the former business manager of the magazine &quot;New Masses&quot;, which in 1938 and 1939 had sponsored John H. Hammond&#x27;s landmark From Spirituals to Swing Concert. Perhaps because of its controversial content, &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; came out under the imprint &quot;Almanac Records&quot;, and Bernay insisted that the performers themselves (in this case Pete Seeger, Millard Lampell, Josh White, and Sam Gary, an interracial group) pay for the costs of production. &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; attacked big American corporations (such as J.P. Morgan and DuPont), repeating the Party&#x27;s line that they had supported German rearmament, and during the period of re-armament in 1941, were now vying for government contracts to build up the defenses of the U.S. Besides being anti-union, these corporations were a focus of progressive and black activist anger because they barred blacks from employment in defense work.

The album also criticized President Roosevelt&#x27;s unprecedented peacetime draft, insinuating that he was going to war for J.P. Morgan. Seeger later said that he believed the Communist argument at that time that the war was &quot;phony&quot; and that big business merely wanted to use Hitler as a proxy to attack Soviet Russia. Bess Lomax Hawes, who was twenty at the time and did not sing on the &quot;John Doe&quot; album, writes in her autobiography &quot;Sing It Pretty&quot; (2008), that for her part, she had taken the pacifist oath as a girl out of repugnance for what she thought was the senseless brutality of the First World War (a sentiment shared by many) and that she took the oath very seriously. However, she said that events were happening so fast, and such terrible news was coming out about German atrocities, that the Almanacs hardly knew what to believe from one day to the next, and they found themselves adjusting their topical repertoire on a daily basis.
Every day, it seemed, another once-stable European political reality would fall to the rapidly expanding Nazi armies, and the agonies of the death camps were beginning to reach our ears. The Almanacs, as self-defined commentators, were inevitably affected by the intense national debate between the &quot;warmongers&quot; and the &quot;isolationists&quot; (and the points between). Before every booking we had to decide: were we going to sing some of our hardest-hitting and most eloquent songs, all of which were antiwar, and if we weren&#x27;t, what would we sing anyway? ... We hoped the next headline would not challenge our entire roster of poetic ideas. Woody Guthrie wrote a song that mournfully stated: &quot;I started out to write a song to the entire population / But no sooner than I got the words down, here come a brand new situation&quot;.

On June 22, 1941, Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and attacked the Soviet Union, and Keynote promptly destroyed all its inventory of &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot;. The CIO now urged support for Roosevelt and the draft, and it forbade its members from participation in strikes for the duration (angering some in the movement).

On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt, under pressure from black leaders, who were threatening a massive march on Washington against segregation in the army and the exclusion of blacks from factories doing defense work, signed Executive Order 8802 (The Fair Employment Act) banning racial discrimination by corporations receiving federal defense contracts. The racial situation, which had threatened black support for the peacetime draft, was now somewhat defused (even though the Army still declined to desegregate) and the march was canceled.

The Almanac&#x27;s second album, &quot;&quot;Talking Union&quot;&quot;, also produced by Bernay, was a collection of six labor songs: &quot;Union Maid&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want Your Millions Mister&quot;, &quot;Get Thee Behind Me Satan&quot;, &quot;Union Train&quot;, &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot;, and the eponymous &quot;Talking Union&quot;. This album, issued in July 1941, was not anti-Roosevelt but was criticized in a review by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, nevertheless. It was reissued by Folkways in 1955 with additional songs and is still available today. The Almanacs also issued two albums of traditional folk songs with no political content in 1941: an album of sea chanteys, &quot;Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads&quot; (sea chanteys, as was well known, being Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s favorite kind of song) and &quot;Sod-Buster Ballads&quot;, which were songs of the pioneers. Both of these were produced by Alan Lomax on General, the label that had issued his Jelly Roll Morton recordings in 1940. When the USA entered the European war after Germany&#x27;s post-Pearl Harbor declaration of war in December 1941, the Almanacs recorded a new topical album for Keynote in support of the war effort, &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, under the supervision of Earl Robinson, that included Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Reuben James&quot; (1942).

The title song, &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo: 

Now, Mr. President, / We haven&#x27;t always agreed in the past, I know, / But that ain&#x27;t at all important now. / What is important is what we got to do, / We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do, / Other things can wait.//
Now, as I think of our great land . . . / I know it ain&#x27;t perfect, but it will be someday, / Just give us a little time. // This is the reason that I want to fight, / Not &#x27;cause everything&#x27;s perfect, or everything&#x27;s right. / No, it&#x27;s just the opposite: I&#x27;m fightin&#x27; because / I want a better America, and better laws, / And better homes, and jobs, and schools, / And no more Jim Crow, and no more rules like / &quot;You can&#x27;t ride on this train &#x27;cause you&#x27;re a Negro,&quot; / &quot;You can&#x27;t live here &#x27;cause you&#x27;re a Jew,&quot;/ &quot;You can&#x27;t work here &#x27;cause you&#x27;re a union man.&quot;//So, Mr. President, / We got this one big job to do / That&#x27;s lick Mr. Hitler and when we&#x27;re through, / Let no one else ever take his place / To trample down the human race. / So what I want is you to give me a gun / So we can hurry up and get the job done. 
In 1942, Army intelligence and the FBI determined that the Almanacs and their former anti-draft message were still a seditious threat to recruitment and the morale of the war effort among blacks and youth, and they were hounded by hostile reviews, exposure of their Communist ties and negative coverage in the New York press, like the headline &quot;Commie Singers try to Infiltrate Radio&quot;. They disbanded in late 1942 or early 1943. It has been suggested that the popularity and credibility of the group were affected by the constantly changing policies of the Communist Party and uncertainty about where their music stood in relation to these changes.

In 1945, after the end of the war, Millard Lampell went on to become a successful screenwriter, writing under a pseudonym while blacklisted. In 1943, Woody Guthrie wrote and published his famous semi-autobiographical book &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;. Later that year he joined the Merchant Marines with fellow (non-Almanac) folksinger Cisco Houston, and would be drafted into the army until late 1945; Woody afterwards performed solo and with others (but not as part of an organized band) until becoming progressively overcome by Huntington&#x27;s Disease in the mid 1950s. The other founding Almanac members Pete Seeger and Lee Hays became President and Executive Secretary, respectively, of People&#x27;s Songs, an organization with the goal of providing protest music to union activists, repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, and electing Henry A. Wallace on the third, Progressive Party, ticket. People&#x27;s Songs disbanded in 1948, after the defeat of Wallace. Seeger and Hays, joined by two of Hays&#x27; young friends, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, then began singing together again at fund-raising folk dances, with a repertoire geared to international folk music. The new singing group, appearing for a while in 1949 under the rubric, &quot;The Nameless Quartet&quot;, changed their name to The Weavers and went on to achieve great renown.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-30 (; NATO reporting name: Flanker-C/G/H) is a twin-engine, two-seat supermaneuverable fighter aircraft developed in the Soviet Union by Russia&#x27;s Sukhoi Aviation Corporation. It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, air-to-air interdiction missions. The Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) were reported to have 130 Su-30SMs in operation as of 2024.

The Su-30 started as an internal development project in the Sukhoi Su-27 family by Sukhoi. From the Su-27UB two-seat trainer, the Su-27PU heavy interceptor was developed. The design plan was revamped and the Su-27PU was renamed to Su-30 by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the Su-27, Su-30, Su-33, Su-34 and Su-35 have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Russian Defense Ministry. Later, different export requirements split the Su-30 into two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organizations: KnAAPO and the Irkut Corporation, both of which come under the Sukhoi aerospace group&#x27;s umbrella.

KnAAPO manufactures the Su-30MKK and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO&#x27;s involvement from the early stages of developing the Su-35, these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter radar so the canards could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both air supremacy and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle.

Irkut traditionally served the Soviet Air Defense and, in the early years of Flanker development, was responsible for manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed an interest in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole Su-30MKI, which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as canards, thrust-vectoring, and a long-range phased-array radar. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia respectively. The VKS operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM variant as well.

While the original Su-27 had good range, it still did not have enough range for the Soviet Air Defense Forces (PVO, as opposed to VVS – the Soviet Air Force). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range interceptor or airborne command post.

The two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members. A &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; demonstrator flew on 6 June 1987, and this led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.

===Later development===
==Design==

The Su-30 is a multirole fighter. It has a two-seat cockpit with an airbrake behind the canopy. It can serve as an air superiority fighter and as a strike fighter.

===Flight characteristics===
The integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the thrust vectoring control ability, results in high maneuverability and supermaneuverability characteristics. Equipped with a digital fly-by-wire system, the Su-30 can perform some very advanced maneuvers, including the Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra and the tailslide. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a Doppler radar-lock, as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.

Some variants of the Su-30, notably the Su-30MKI and its derivatives including the Su-30MKM and Su-30SM, are fitted with canards to enhance maneuverability and also compensate for the heavier N011M Bars radar and mission systems in the nose. The canards and the reshaped LERX help control the vortices and increase the angle-of-attack limit of the airframe, but they also add drag and reduce the maximum speed to Mach 1.75.

===Powerplant===
As with the baseline Su-27S/P, the Su-30&#x27;s powerplant incorporates two Saturn AL-31F afterburning low-bypass turbofan engines, fed through intake ramps. Two AL-31Fs, each rated at of full afterburning thrust for speeds up to Mach 2 in level flight and 1,350 km/h speed at low altitude for non-canard variants. Canted thrust vectoring is used in some variants to enhance maneuverability.

With a normal fuel reserve of 5,270 kg, the Su-30MK is capable of performing a 4.5-hour combat mission with a range of 3,000 km. An aerial refueling system increases the range to or flight duration up to 10 hours at cruise altitudes.

===Avionics===
The aircraft features autopilot ability at all flight stages including low-altitude flight in terrain-following radar mode, and individual and group combat employment against air and ground/sea-surface targets. Automatic control system interconnected with the navigation system ensures route flight, target approach, recovery to airfield and landing approach in automatic mode.

As of 2020, the French firm Thales had integrated its holographic Head-Up Display 3022 system into the Su-30SM. The Russians let the Belarusian side acquire this tool in December 2020. This system is used for tactical situation analysis, map presentation, navigation, attack system, and is used to interrogate avionic sensors and to control effectors. Some of the at least $783,000 that Irkut-Yakovlev sourced from Thales in 2022 were for this system.

===Maintenance===
The sanctions policy created as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine caused problems with aftermarket sales and servicing of the French systems that have become an integral part of the Su-30SM. The VKS now needs, via its Rosaviaspetskomplekt partner, to have its warplanes maintained by the Kazakhstani firm ARC Group which is the &quot;exclusive distributor of Safran Electronics &amp; Defence in the Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;.

==Operational history==

===Russia===
In 1994–1996, an initial batch of five original Su-30 (Su-27PU) fighters, contracted for the Russian Defence Ministry, were delivered to 54th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based at Savasleyka air base. After the regiment was disbanded in 2002, the aircraft became part of 4th Centre for Combat Employment and Retraining of Personnel in Lipetsk where they were flown mostly by Russian Falcons aerobatic team. No further orders of the variant were made. However, the Russian Defence Ministry was impressed with the export Su-30MKI&#x27;s performance envelope and ordered a local version of the same aircraft for their own use, called the Su-30SM, which is the third adaptation of the MKI after the Malaysian Su-30MKM and the Algerian MKA. A total of 60 Su-30SM fighters, under two contracts signed in March and December 2012, respectively. On 21 September 2012, the Su-30SM performed its maiden flight. The Russian Air Force has received first two serial aircraft on 22 November 2012. By end of 2015, 31st Fighter Aviation Regiment, the last aviation regiment of the Russian Aerospace Forces that operated Soviet-made MiG-29A/UBs (izdeliye 9.12/9.13) was fully rearmed with about twenty new Su-30SM fighters. All aircraft of the first two contracts were delivered by 2016.

Another 36 aircraft were ordered in April 2016, six of which intended for the Russian Naval Aviation. This was to increase the total number to 116 (88 in the Air Force and 28 in the Navy).

In October–November 2016, eight new aircraft were handed to Russian Knights aerobatic team, replacing the team&#x27;s six Su-27 fighters. The aircraft are stationed at Kubinka air base, Moscow Oblast.

During the 2017 MAKS International Aviation and Space Salon, it was announced that the Russian Defence Ministry and Irkut Corporation are working on modernization of Russia&#x27;s Su-30SM fighters to a new &quot;Su-30SM1&quot; standard. The modernization is aimed on improvements in aircraft&#x27;s avionics and armament.

The Su-30SM attained full operational capability (FOC) in January 2018, by a resolution of the Russian president.

In August 2019, the Russian Defence Ministry first signed a contract for undisclosed number of modernized Su-30SM2 (then referred to it as Su-30SM1) fighters. First deliveries to the Russian Aerospace Forces are scheduled for late 2020 with serial deliveries to commence in 2021. The aircraft will receive the N035 Irbis radar and AL-41F1S engines of the Su-35S, what is to standardize and reduce operational costs of the two variants. The aircraft&#x27;s armament will be also enhanced of the new KAB-250 aerial bombs and Kh-59MK2 stealth cruise missiles. It is planned to modernize all Russia&#x27;s Su-30SMs to the SM2 standard.

On 25 August 2020, a contract for 21 modernized Su-30SM2 aircraft for the Russian Naval Aviation was signed at the &#x27;ARMY-2020&#x27; military-technical forum.

====2015 Russian military intervention in Syria====
In September 2015, Russia deployed Su-30SM fighters for the first time to Bassel Al-Assad International Airport in Latakia, Syria. At least four Su-30SM fighters were spotted in a satellite photo. In late December 2015, there were 16 Su-30SMs at Khmeimim Air Base. As part of their combat deployment, they provided target illumination for bombers launching airstrikes against rebel groups.

Su-30SMs were initially tasked with aerial escort of Russian attack jets and strategic bombers but conducted also air to ground duties. On 21 March 2017, rebel forces launched a new offensive in the Hama province; a few days later a video emerged showing a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-30SM striking ground targets with unguided air-to-ground rockets in a dive attack against the rebels.

On 3 May 2018, a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-30 crashed shortly after take-off from the Khmeimim Air Base, killing both crew members.

====2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====
Russian Su-30SM and Su-35s fighters were used for air superiority missions during the war. Combined, at least seven air to air victories were reported over Ukrainian jet aircraft and one over a Ukrainian Naval Aviation Mil Mi-14. In turn, Russia lost six Su-30SMs in the air, and five were observed to be lost on the ground.

A Russian Su-30 was destroyed on the ground by Ukrainian OTR-21 Tochka missiles fired during the Millerovo air base attack. On 5 March 2022 a Russian Naval Aviation Su-30SM was shot down in Bashtanka area, Mykolayiv Oblast. The pilot was captured. On 13 March 2022 another aircraft was lost over Ukraine; the pilot, Kosyk Serhiy Serhiyovych, survived and was captured. On 9 August 2022, explosions at Saky air base in Novofedorivka, Crimea left at least three Su-30s destroyed and one damaged according to satellite imagery. On 18 August a Su-30SM, serial number RF-81771, had its wreckage recorded in Kharkiv region in the Izyum direction. Another Su-30SM, serial number &quot;RF-81773&quot; callsign &quot;Red 62&quot;, was discovered by Ukrainian forces near Izium, Kharkiv. Fate of the pilots is unknown.

On 27 August 2023, Ukrainian media, citing claims made by the Security Service of Ukraine, said that 16 Sypaq Corvo Precision Payload Delivery System drones had been used in an attack on the Kursk Vostochny Airport in Russia, with three shot down and the others hitting four Su-30s and one MiG-29 aircraft. An S-300 radar and two Pantsir air defence systems were also reportedly hit.

On 2 February 2025, a Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 was shot down in the area of Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast. Russian sources claimed it was shot down by an R-37M missile fired from a Su-30SM2. The pilot, kapitan Ivan Bolotov of the 831st Tactical Aviation Brigade, did not survive.

===India===

First talks about acquiring of new fighter for the Indian Air Force began in 1994. A year later, Sukhoi Design Bureau started working on the new fighter based on the original Su-30 design, which later evolved into Su-30MK (&quot;Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy&quot; - Modernised Commercial) and ultimately into Su-30MKI (&quot;Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy Indiski&quot; - Modernised Commercial Indian). On 30 November 1996, Russian state company Rosvooruzhenie (now Rosoboronexport) and Indian Defence Ministry signed a contract for development and production of eight Su-30Ks and 32 Su-30MKIs for the Indian Air Force. In March–July 1997, all eight Su-30Ks of the order were delivered at Lohegaon Air Force Base in India. On 28 December 2000, as part of the Russian-Indian cooperation, a contract worth more than US$3 billion was signed for license production of 140 Su-30MKI fighters at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) production plant in Nashik. Between 2002–2004, in accordance with the 1996 contract, 32 Su-30MKIs were built by Irkutsk Aviation Plant for the Indian Air Force. From 2004 onwards, production is carried by HAL.

In 2007, India and Russia agreed to a deal for another 40 Su-30MKIs for US$1.6 billion, to be produced in India under licence. In March 2010, it was reported India and Russia were negotiating a contract for additional 42 aircraft. The contract worth US$1.6 billion was signed in December 2011, increasing the total number of ordered aircraft up to 272. By March 2020, India had completed the production of all 272 Su-30MKIs licensed under previous contracts. The country was also considering acquisition of 12 more fighters to compensate for Su-30 losses over nearly 20 years of operation. In 2020, due to the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes, India determined to purchase 12 additional Su-30MKIs.

In 2024, Indian media reported negotiations between HAL and Russia for exporting Indian-produced Su-30MKIs. This may be to circumvent American economic sanctions on the export of Russian weapons and their technology.

===China===

To better counter USAF&#x27;s expanding capabilities in the region, in 1996, an agreement worth US$1.8 billion was reached with Russia to purchase some 38 multirole combat aircraft based on the original Su-30 design. Taking into account China&#x27;s requirements for its new fighter, the aircraft became known as Su-30MKK (&quot;Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy Kitayski&quot; - Modernised Commercial Chinese).

In March 1999, first prototype took off from Gromov Flight Research Institute in Russia and a year later it appeared at Zhuhai Air Show in China. People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has received first batch of ten Su-30MKK fighters in December 2000, following by second and third batches of ten fighters in August and December 2001, respectively. In July 2001, China has ordered 38 more Su-30MKK fighters.

A modified variant, known as &quot;Su-30MK2&quot;, was negotiated for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) in 2002, with contract for 24 aircraft signed in 2003. All the aircraft were delivered to PLANAF in 2004.

===Myanmar===

The Myanmar Air Force ordered six Su-30SMEs in 2018. 2 Su-30SMEs delivered in March 2022 and entered service on 15 December. Between 4 and 6 have arrived as of November 2022. 4 delivered as of 15 December 2023. Another 2 Su-30 SME had been received in 15 December 2024. The Myanmar Air Force has between 8 and 10 Su-30SMEs.

===Malaysia===

Malaysia ordered 18 Su-30MKMs in May 2003. The first two Su-30MKMs were formally handed over in Irkutsk on 23 May 2007 and arrived in Malaysia at RMAF Gong Kedak Air Base in Terengganu on 21 June 2007. As part of the contract agreement, Russia sent the first Malaysian cosmonaut to the International Space Station in October 2007. In 2014, Malaysia had 18 Su-30MKMs in service.

According to Malaysian defense Minister Mohamad Sabu, Malaysia has grounded 14 of 18 Su-30MKM due to engine problems and unavailability of spare parts in 2018. To overcome this problem and increase the readiness of the Su-30MKM fleets, Malaysia has approved the budget worth RM2.2 billion for the Su-30MKM to be upgraded locally by Aerospace Technology Systems Corporation. The first upgraded aircraft was received in 2019 in LIMA 2019 exhibition.

===Venezuela===
The Government of Venezuela announced on 14 June 2006 it would purchase 24 Su-30MKV fighters from Russia. The first two Su-30MK2s arrived in early December 2006 while another eight were commissioned during 2007; 14 more aircraft arrived in 2008. In October 2015, Venezuela announced the purchase of 12 more Su-30MKVs from Russia for US$480 million.

===Algeria===

As part of wider US$8 billion deal signed with Russia in 2006, that also included 34 MiG-29 fighters and number of Yak-130 trainers, Algeria has ordered 28 Su-30MKAs for its air force. It was to receive additional 16 Su-30MKAs in exchange for the 39 MiG-29s rejected due to quality disputes and old equipment used. By 2015, it had 44 Su-30MKAs in service with 14 more on order.

In September 2019, Algeria ordered 16 more aircraft. As of 2022, it has 70 Su-30MKAs in service.

===Uganda===
Uganda signed a contract for six Su-30MK2s in 2010. Deliveries took place between June 2011 and June 2012. In November 2011, one aircraft performed a belly landing at Entebbe International Airport. It was later repaired.

===Indonesia===

In 2001, reports emerged Indonesia has showed an interest to acquire about 16 Su-30 fighters, as a replacement for its ageing fleet of 12 F-16A/B and F-5E/F fighters. From 2003 to 2011, and because of the U.S-imposed arms embargo against it, it has ordered a combined 11 Su-30MKK/MK2s (2 Su-30MKK and 9 Su-30MK2) for the Air Force. In September 2013, it had all Su-30MKK/MK2s in inventory. The aircraft were upgraded by Belarus in 2019.

===Angola===
As part of a US$1 billion deal that also includes other equipment and maintenance services for the country, Angola has ordered 12 out of 18 former Indian Su-30K fighters on 16 October 2013. The Su-30Ks were initially delivered to India in 1997–1998, but were returned to Russia in 2007 in exchange for 18 full-fledged Su-30MKI fighters. Angola received first two aircraft in September 2017, four in 2018 and the rest in April 2019. Angolan Su-30Ks were also upgraded to the &quot;SM&quot; standard.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam has received about 20 Su-30MK2s under two contracts signed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. On 21 August 2013, Russia announced it would deliver another batch of 12 Su-30MK2s under a $450 million contract, with deliveries in 2014–2015.

On 14 June 2016, a Su-30MK2 of the Vietnamese Air Force went missing during a training flight 30–40 km off the coast of Nghệ An Province. One out of the two pilots survived. At the time, there were some 32 Su-30MK2s in service.

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan has ordered in total 24 Su-30SM fighters under three contracts. It received first four Su-30SMs under the first contract worth of RUB 5 billion in April 2015. A second contract for eight aircraft was signed in December 2015.

The first two aircraft of the second order were delivered in December 2016 and another two in December 2017. The third order for 12 more aircraft was approved in August 2017 and eight aircraft were ordered in May 2018. The last four aircraft of the second contract were delivered in December 2018. It had 12 Su-30SMs in service as of December 2018.

===Armenia===
In January 2016, then Armenian Defense Minister Seyran Ohanyan mentioned that Russia had discussed the possibility of supplying Su-30 fighters to Armenia during a four-day Russian-Armenian intergovernmental commission on bilateral military-technical cooperation. Armenia has ordered four Su-30SMs in February 2019, with deliveries expected to begin in 2020. The country plans to acquire additional Su-30SM aircraft, according to the Armenian Defense Minister David Tonoyan.

On 27 December 2019, Armenia has received all four aircraft ahead of schedule. The aircraft landed at the Shirak Airport during a visit of Armenian Defense Minister David Tonoyan and Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Artak Davtyan. In August 2020, negotiations were under way to acquire a new batch of Su-30SM fighters, according to Armenian Defense Minister David Tonoyan.

In March 2021, Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of Armenia, confirmed that Armenia bought Su-30SM fighters without missiles package from Russia.

These aircraft were left unused in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war as a result of the purchase of aircraft without missiles. On September 16, 2024, Armenia reached out to India for assistance in procuring Astra missiles for their Su-30s. Assistance was also being sought from HAL for their expertise in upgrading the Su-30.

===Belarus===
In February 2016, Russia and Belarus concluded a preliminary agreement regarding to the export of an undisclosed number of Su-30s to Belarus. On 20 June 2017, during the Le Bourget international air show, Belarus signed a contract to purchase 12 Su-30SMs under a deal worth US$600 million and were originally planned to be delivered in 2018. Western embargoes on components delayed delivery, with the first four aircraft arriving at Baranovichi Air Base in November 2019, with four more planned to arrive to 2020 with deliveries completed in 2021. 8 additional Su-30s were scheduled to arrive in 2024.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
On 13 July 2024, a Russian Shahed drone entered Belarusian air space without authorization. A Belarusian Su-30 was sortied to intercept the drone. The drone eventually crashed in western Belarus, 60 miles west of Minsk.

=== Potential operators ===

==== Iran ====
In February 2016, Iran&#x27;s then Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan during his visit to Moscow announced that the country intends to buy an undisclosed number of Su-30SM fighters.

==== Argentina ====
In 2021, Russia offered the Argentine Air Force a batch of 15 MiG-29 fighters and another batch of 12 Su-30 fighters and seeks also the sale of Yak-130 training jet and Mil Mi-17 helicopters.

;Su-30MKV/Su-30MK2 AMV (&quot;Flanker-G+&quot;)
:Export version of Su-30MK2 for Venezuela built on Su-35 airframe, and thus is slightly smaller than the standard Su-30MK2. To avoid confusion after Vietnam also placed an order for Su-30MK2, the designation for those ordered by Venezuela was changed from the original Su-30MKV to Su-30MK2 AMV with AMV stands for Aviacion Militar Venezolana (Venezuelan Military Aviation).
;Su-30MK2V (&quot;Flanker-G+&quot;)
:Export version of Su-30MK2 for Vietnam with modifications such as redesigned ejection seat to accommodate the smaller body frames of Vietnamese pilots, and other minor modification of upgrading communications gear. The original designation Su-30MKV caused confusion with those Su-30MK2s ordered by Venezuela, which already had Su-30MKV designation, so to avoid confusion, Su-30MK2s ordered by Vietnam was redesignated Su-30MK2V. Vietnam still internally designates it Su-30MK2 with the MK2V designation rarely used.

==Accidents and notable incidents ==

* On 12 June 1999, a Russian Su-30MK crashed at the Paris Air Show, Le Bourget, France. Both pilots ejected safely and no one was hurt on the ground.
* On 22 September 2020, a Russian Su-30M2 was shot down by a Su-35S during air combat training which pitted two Su-35S against one Su-30M2. When the pilot of a Su-35S pulled the trigger to record the simulated hit, the jet fired a burst from its 30mm GSh-30-1 cannon, hitting the right wing of the Su-30M2, leaving the aircraft uncontrollable and forcing its crew to eject.
* Between 1 and 6 of April 2022, a Russian Su-30SM, code 60 Red (RF-81771) was shot down by Ukrainian Forces near Izyums’Kyi District in the Kharkiv region. Its skin has been made into keychains and parts of it are for sale.
* On 23 October 2022, a Russian Su-30SM crashed into a residential building in the Siberian city of Irkutsk during a test flight. The two pilots died in the crash, but there were no casualties on the ground. Investigators suspect that the aircraft&#x27;s oxygen system had been refilled with nitrogen, which caused both pilots to become unconscious and lose control of the aircraft in flight.
* On 12 August 2023, a Russian Su-30 crashed in the Kaliningrad region during a training flight. Both airmen were killed.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO reporting name: Flanker-D) is a Soviet/Russian all-weather carrier-based twin-engine air superiority fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, derived from the Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards, and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for a slower stall speed. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable.

First used in operations in 1995 aboard the aircraft carrier , the fighter officially entered service in August 1998, by which time the designation &quot;Su-33&quot; was used. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy, only 24 aircraft were produced. Attempted sales to China and India fell through. With plans to retire the Su-33 once they reach the end of their service life, the Russian Navy ordered the MiG-29K as a replacement in 2009.

== Development ==

=== Background and origins ===
During the 1970s, the Yakovlev Yak-38, then the Soviet Navy&#x27;s only operational carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Project 1143 carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of aircraft carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for Yak-141, MiG-29K and Su-27K operations.
To prepare for the operations of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on board the new carrier, work proceeded on the development of the steam catapult, arresting gear, optical and radio landing systems. The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and &quot;Varyag&quot;. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (−3, −24 and −25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a ski-jump profile.

Conceptual designs of the Su-27K commenced in 1978. On 18 April 1984, the Soviet government instructed Sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter; Mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multirole fighter. Full-scale design of the Su-27K soon started as the &quot;T-10K&quot; under the guidance of Konstantin Marbyshev. Nikolai Sadovnikov was appointed the design bureau&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot for the programme. By November 1984, conceptual design had passed its critical design review, with the detailed design finalised in 1986. The two prototypes were constructed in conjunction with KnAAPO in 1986–1987.

=== Testing ===


The first Su-27K prototype, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov, made its maiden flight on 17 August 1987 at the NITKA facility; the second followed on 22 December. Flight tests continued at NITKA, where Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks demonstrated and validated the feasibility of ski-jump operations. The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another two years before &quot;Tbilisi&quot;, subsequently renamed &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;, left the shipyard.

Viktor Pugachyov, piloting the second Su-27K, became the first Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It was found that the carrier&#x27;s jet blast deflectors were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield&#x27;s water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.

During the following three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings. Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials. During 1990–1991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.

=== Further developments ===
The first of two known versions of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999. The aircraft, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov and Sergey Melnikov, flew for 40 minutes near Ramenskoye Airport. The Su-33UB (Initially named as Su-27KUB, &quot;Korabelny Uchebno-Boevo&quot;, or &quot;carrier combat trainer&quot;) was planned to be a trainer, but with the potential to fill other roles. Notable improvements over the Su-33 included a revised forward fuselage and leading edge slats, bigger wings and stabilators.

=== Modernization ===

In 2010, Sukhoi developed an upgraded version of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernized Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, the Shenyang J-15, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy. Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (132 kN, 29,800 lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust 
vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.

In September 2016, it was announced the Su-33 will be outfitted with new sighting and computing system SVP-24 from the Russian company Gefest &amp; T, that will allow the aircraft to use unguided bombs with a similar precision as guided ones, giving it an ability of a strike fighter. The SVP-24 takes into account data such as current plane&#x27;s location together with flight parameters, target data and environmental parameters and determines the optimal trajectory for unguided ammunition. It is believed, the installation of modern targeting systems will increase the capability of the Su-33 fighters close to Su-30SM level.

The second stage of the modernization is to include installation of more powerful engines and detection systems, according to Naval Aviation Chief Major-General Igor Kozhin.

== Design ==
To adapt the original Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage to withstand the great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not &#x27;float&#x27; and slow its descent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, as well as an in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.

Compared with the rival MiG-29K, the Su-33&#x27;s maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel capacity is more than double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can spend as much time as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as , in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.

The Su-33 carries guided missiles such as the R-73 (four) and R-27E (six) on twelve hardpoints, supplemented by the 150-round 30 mm GSh-30-1. It can carry an assortment of unguided rockets, bombs and cluster bombs for secondary air-to-ground missions. The aircraft can be used in both night and day operations at sea. The radar used, &quot;Slot Back&quot;, has been speculated to have poor multi-target tracking, making the Su-33 reliant on other radar platforms and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft like the Kamov Ka-31 early-warning helicopter. The R-27EM missiles have the capability to intercept anti-ship missiles. The infra-red search and track (IRST) system is placed to provide better downward visibility.

== Operational history ==

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
With the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Russian Navy was dramatically downsized, with many shipbuilding programmes stopped. If the &quot;Varyag&quot;, &quot;Oryol&quot; and had been commissioned, a total of 72 production airframes would have been built; the early-airborne warning and MiG-29K would also have proceeded, instead of being abandoned. Only 24 examples were built at the time &quot;Varyag&quot; was sold to China.

The Su-27K was introduced in the mid-1990s and from December 1995 to March 1996, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; set sail in the Mediterranean Sea, carrying two Su-25UTGs, nine Ka-27s, and 13 Su-27Ks. The aircraft officially entered service on 31 August 1998 under new designation &quot;Su-33&quot;. The 279th independent Shipborne Assault Aviation Regiment based at Severomorsk-3 air base became the first unit operating the variant.

In 2009, it was announced the Russian Navy will procure 24 MiG-29Ks to replace its fleet of about 19 Su-33s in service, with deliveries to be completed by 2015. However, in 2015, Chief of the Naval Aviation General Major Igor Kozhin, announced that a second fighter regiment would be formed to augment the current force, with the MiG-29Ks to be used by the new unit. The existing 19 Su-33s were to be refurbished for further use. In September 2016, at least six Su-33s were upgraded with the SVP-24 targeting system as the aircraft were preparing for their combat deployment to Syria.

In 2017, the United Engine Corporation announced it has resumed the production of upgraded AL-31F series 3 engines for all remaining 18 Su-33 fighters. The first batch of engines was delivered to the customer the same year.

====2015 Russian military intervention in Syria====


On 15 November 2016, in the course of Russia&#x27;s large-scale military operations against terrorist groups in Syria, Su-33s operated from the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; aircraft carrier in the type&#x27;s first combat employment, striking ISIL and Al-Nusra terrorist facilities in Syria&#x27;s Idlib and Homs provinces with 500 kg precision ammunition. The main targets were ammunition warehouses, gathering and training centers and weapon production plants. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, at least 30 militants including three field commanders were killed due to the strikes.

On 5 December 2016, a Su-33 crashed into the Mediterranean Sea after the arrestor cable broke up during the aircraft&#x27;s second landing attempt on board the aircraft carrier. The pilot managed to eject and survived without injuries.

=== Failed bids ===
Internationally, the People’s Republic of China was identified as a possible export customer. Russia&#x27;s state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion. China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $100 million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12–48 aircraft. The fighters were intended to be used with the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme, with the former Soviet carrier &quot;Varyag&quot; as the centrepiece.

At the sixth Zhuhai Airshow in late 2006, Lieutenant General Aleksander Denisov publicly confirmed at a news conference that China had approached Russia for the possible purchase of Su-33s, and negotiations were to start in 2007. On 1 November 2006, the Xinhua News Agency published the information on its military website that China planned to introduce the Su-33. China had previously obtained a manufacturing license for Su-27 production.

Sukhoi is working on a more advanced version, the Su-33K, a development to integrate the advanced technologies of the Su-35 fighters into the older Su-33 airframe. However, worries over other Chinese intentions emerged when it was reported that China had acquired one of the T-10Ks, a Su-33 prototype, from Ukraine, potentially to study and reverse engineer a domestic version. Various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from the Su-33, such as the Shenyang J-15. Photos of Shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a T-10K carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that the J-15 is directly related to T-10K. Negotiations stagnated as the Shenyang Aircraft company sought to reduce Russian content in the aircraft, while Sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to the J-11.

India was also viewed as another potential operator of the Su-33. The Indian Navy planned to acquire the Su-33 for its aircraft carrier, , the refurbished Soviet , which was sold to India in 2004. In the end, the rival MiG-29K was opted for, because of the Su-33&#x27;s outdated avionics. The size of the Su-33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating it off the Indian carriers, a constraint not shared by the smaller MiG-29K.

<text>The AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo (), commonly known as the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), is a multirole combat aircraft named after Chiang Ching-kuo, the late President of the Republic of China. The aircraft made its first flight in 1989. It entered service with Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) in 1992. All 130 production aircraft were manufactured by 1999.

Taiwan initiated the IDF program when the United States refused to sell them F-20 Tigershark and F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighters following diplomatic pressure from China. Taiwan therefore decided to develop an advanced indigenous jet fighter. The Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC), based in Taichung, Taiwan, designed and built the IDF jet fighter.

==Development==

===Background===

The preliminary search for a replacement for the ROCAF&#x27;s F-5s and F-104s began with the XF-6 indigenous fighter project, later renamed &quot;Ying Yang&quot;, in the late 1970s. After the US established formal relations with China and ended the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, President Chiang Ching-Kuo decided to expand the indigenous defense industry and on August 28, 1980, ordered AIDC to design an indigenous interceptor. Originally, the ROCAF listed the priority of the XF-6 behind the XA-3 &quot;Lei Ming&quot; single seat attack aircraft, due to the believed high risks of the XF-6 project.

The signing of the 1982 US-China Joint Communiqué limited arms sales to Taiwan. The United States refused to sell the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Northrop F-20 Tigershark (which had been developed largely to meet Taiwanese national defense needs for an advanced jet fighter to replace their older F-5 jet fighters) thereby ensuring the continuation of the indigenous fighter project. Although US President Ronald Reagan reluctantly accepted his advisers&#x27; suggestion of building relations with China to counter the USSR, Reagan decided to balance the 1982 US-PRC Communiqué with the &quot;Six Assurances&quot; to Taiwan. This opened the door for US technology transfer and assistance to Taiwan&#x27;s defense industry, including the IDF project.

===Design phase===

The AIDC officially began the IDF development project in May 1982 following the ROCAF&#x27;s failure to purchase new fighters from the United States as a result of Chinese diplomatic pressure. The project, led by Hsi-Chun Mike Hua, later known as &quot;the father of the Indigenous Defense Fighter&quot;, was named &quot;An-Hsiang&quot; (安翔, Safe Flight) and divided into four sections in 1983:

*&quot;Ying-Yang&quot; (鷹揚): &quot;Soaring Eagle&quot;. Development of the airframe. Some cooperation with General Dynamics.
*&quot;Yun-Han&quot; (雲漢): &quot;Galaxy&quot;. Development of the aircraft powerplant and propulsion. Cooperation with Garrett (Now Honeywell).
*&quot;Tien-Lei&quot; (天雷): &quot;Thunder&quot;. Development of the avionics systems. Some cooperation with Smiths Industries, with some components purchased directly from Lear Astronics (today a subsidiary of BAE), Litton (today a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman) and Martin-Baker.
*&quot;Tien-Chien&quot; (天劍): &quot;Sky Sword&quot;. Development of air-to-air missiles.

In April 1997 American company Litton&#x27;s Applied Technology division was awarded a production contract and options totaling $116.2 million by the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation for Improved Radar Warning Receivers (IRWR) to be installed aboard.

====Yun Han: engine research====

Exports of advanced engines such as the General Electric F404 or the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 were not available to Taiwan and both the General Electric J85 and General Electric J79 were considered unsuitable in their performance, and most European and American engine companies declined to cooperate with the project. Joint investment with Garrett became the only practical solution.

In 1978, following the success of the TFE731 engine, U.S. engine company Garrett announced joint research of the TFE1042 afterburner with the Swedish company Volvo Flygmotor. The TFE731 Model 1042 was touted as a low bypass ratio &quot;military derivative of the proven commercial TFE731 engine&quot; and that it would provide &quot;efficient, reliable, cost effective propulsion for the next generation of light strike and advanced trainer aircraft&quot;, with a thrust of 4260 lbf (18.9 kN) dry and 6790 lbf (30.2 kN) with afterburner. After the initial negotiation, the investment was going to be divided between Garrett, Volvo, AIDC, and the Italian company Piaggio. The development would consist of the non-afterburning TFE1042-6 for light attack aircraft and advanced trainers, and the TFE1042-7 for the AMX or the F-5 upgrade. AIDC also suggested upgrading the TFE1042-7 to thrust in a twin-engine installation, in order to compete with the GE F404. However, the JAS 39 Gripen project decided to continue with a single F404, and Piaggio asked to participate at a later date due to financial concerns.

ITEC completely redesigned the TFE1042-7 into the TFE1042-70 – for example, the bypass ratio was changed from 0.84 to 0.4, and the investment had increased from US$180 million to about US$320 million. However, to avoid pressures from China, the US government had asked all American companies cooperating with the Taiwan on the IDF project to remain low-key. Therefore, the perception that &quot;the TFE1042 is merely the civilian engine TFE731 with an afterburner&quot; was never completely dispelled.

In 1985, the preliminary review of the IDF&#x27;s design revealed some performance requirement shortfalls, and it was determined that an upgrade of engine thrust by 10% was the simplest solution. Due to American export license restrictions, ITEC used FADEC to artificially limit the thrust below a certain altitude (the restriction was not removed until 1990). Although the upgrade essentially used the TFE1088-11 configuration, to reduce political interference ITEC renamed the original, lower-thrust version as the TFE1042-X70 and retained the TFE1042-70 designation for the upgraded version.

In 1988, ITEC decided to invest in the thrust TFE1088-12, which was re-designated as the TFE1042-70A for political reason as well. Preliminary studies had shown that the IDF could supercruise with the new engine. At the same time, General Electric Aviation decided to enter the market with the J101/SF, a smaller version of the F404. However, after the IDF order was cut in half due to budget concerns, the TFE1088-12 engine upgrade plan ended as well.

====Ying Yang: aerodynamic design====

The cooperation between AIDC and General Dynamics (GD) was divided into four phases:
* GD analyzed the ROCAF&#x27;s aircraft performance and force requirements.
* Taiwan assessed GD&#x27;s reports and chose between AIDC&#x27;s original design and GD&#x27;s new design.
* AIDC sent personnel to GD for the preliminary design phase.
* GD sent personnel to Taiwan to complete the project.

GD&#x27;s assistance was restricted by the US State Department&#x27;s arms export control, which limited GD&#x27;s work to initial design consulting but not further development, production, or marketing.

Many different airframe design concepts were explored (e.g. the 2D Thrust-Vectoring nozzle of XX-201, the double delta wings/twin tailed 401). After the General Electric J79 was officially abandoned as the potential engine solution in 1983, three configurations emerged from AIDC.

* Configuration A was similar to the F-5E.
* Configuration B was similar to the Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen.
* Configuration C was similar to the F-15.

At the same time, GD worked on the G configuration in parallel. Eventually the G-4 was selected, but with many features of the C-2 integrated. During this time, the project was named the &quot;Light Weight Defense Fighter&quot;. In 1985, the configuration conceptual design had evolved into the SE-1 preliminary design. By the end of 1985, AIDC decided to skip the prototype stage and go into Full Scale Development (FSD) directly, in order to reduce time and save money. The project was again renamed into the &quot;Indigenous Defense Fighter&quot;. Four FSD aircraft were made, with three single-seaters and one double-seater.

====Tien Lei: avionics====
The IDF is equipped with a GD-53 &quot;Golden Dragon&quot; multi-mode monopulse pulse-Doppler radar, which is based on the General Electric AN/APG-67 X band radar developed for the F-20 while sharing some components and technologies of the AN/APG-66 radar of the F-16A, and using a larger antenna than used by the F-20. and this adaptation resulted in the look-down and shoot-down capability of GD-53 being greatly enhanced in comparison to that of the original AN/APG-67, reaching that of the AN/APG-66. The radar can simultaneously track 10 targets and engage two of the 10 targets tracked with TC-2 active radar seeker BVRAAMs.

The design is inherently unstable in pitch, so the IDF incorporated a modern triple-redundant full authority fly-by-wire control system. The avionics suite was based on modular architecture with dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B digital databuses. The Honeywell H423 inertial navigation system, the TWS-95 RHAWS, and a Bendix-King head-up display were selected. Some capabilities may have been delayed or dropped in order to meet the performance requirement, since the engine limitation has resulted in the necessity of strict weight control.

====Tien Chien: missiles====

The CSIST&#x27;s &quot;Tien Chien&quot; (Sky Sword) project was slightly more independent, since it was considered to be a development for all the ROCAF&#x27;s aircraft rather than only the IDF. The Tien Chien 1 (TC-1) is a short range infrared-seeking missile with an external configuration similar to that of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, while the Tien Chien 2 (TC-2) is an active radar homing Beyond Visual Range missile.

The first test firing of the TC-1 missile was performed by an F-5E in April 1986, with the Beech target drone successfully destroyed. Initial production of the TC-1 began in 1989, and it entered service in 1991. Both the AIM-9 and the TC-1 have been seen in use on operational IDFs.

CSIST is believed to have cooperated with Motorola and Raytheon on the TC-2&#x27;s active seeker, which is believed to be based on their seeker design which was proposed for the AIM-120. 40 pre-production TC-2 missiles were produced before 1995, and were the only BVR AAMs that the ROCAF had in its inventory during the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis. Over 200 production TC-2s were originally planned.

===Upgrades===
During the F-CK-1&#x27;s development, it was tapped as the secondary delivery vehicle for the Taiwanese nuclear weapons then in development. The primary delivery method was to be the Sky Horse missile. Weapons designers at CSIST were instructed to design the nuclear weapon to fit within the dimensions of the F-CK-1&#x27;s centerline drop tank (~50 cm diameter). Modifications to the aircraft would have been required for it to obtain the desired 1,000 km range (especially without the centerline drop tank available) and were envisioned to include more efficient non-afterburning engines. The F-CK-1 would not have been able to fulfill the nuclear strike mission until mid-1989 at the very earliest. Early designs called for an unpowered gravity bomb. The nuclear weapons program was shut down under US pressure before the F-CK-1 entered service and the dedicated nuclear strike variant was never produced.

The first stage of upgrades to the fleet was originally planned to be completed by 2013, and was planned to include improved avionics, radar, electronics, weapons capabilities and lifespan extensions. In May 2014, the ROC Air Force made photos of the fighters with enhanced Wan Chien long-range missile capabilities public. The upgrade program was finally completed in 2018.

==Variants==

===Prototypes===
Four &quot;Full Scale Development&quot; units were produced; three single-seaters followed by a two-seater. The first successful test flight by single-seater FSD A1 was made on May 28, 1989. The two-seater FSD B1 conducted its first flight on July 10, 1990.

===Pre-production===
Production of ten pre-production units began in October 1990. The first four were delivered in March 1992 and the last in 1993.

Mechanical defects caused two crashes, one in 1991 and one in 1993, during pre-production.

===F-CK-1 A/B &quot;Ching-Kuo&quot;===

The ROCAF&#x27;s initial order for 256 aircraft was cut to 130 in 1991, following deals for the purchase of 150 F-16 Block 20 A/B and 60 Mirage 2000-5Ei/Di with the US and France. The 130 included 28 two-seaters and the 10 pre-production units.

The first production units were delivered in early 1994, and the program concluded in 2000.

The first squadron entered service during the latter part of the 1994.

Mid-life updates to the aircraft were initiated in 2011.

===F-CK-1 C/D &quot;Hsiang Sheng&quot;===


The Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced that beginning in 2001, the government would include a new budget allocation for the IDF upgrade plan (as included in the five MND proposals to help AIDC). The five proposals were:

* Upgrades of the AT-3, IDF, and F-5 would be assigned to AIDC in the future.
* The Army Utility Helicopter, the Navy&#x27;s long range ASW aircraft, a helicopter for the Marines, and an Air Force medium transport will all be produced and assembled by qualifying domestic firms in conjunction with the foreign firms that originally designed them.
* NCSIST and AIDC will jointly assemble a team for the early planning of the ROCAF&#x27;s next generation fighter, in order to assess procurement methods and suggest concepts.
* AIDC&#x27;s joint ventures with foreign firms or alliances with domestic firms will be given high priority in military aircraft service and maintenance.
* In the future, the military will give responsibility for weapons system flight tests, electronic warfare exercises, air towing drones, avionics maintenance, and weapons procurement planning to AIDC, in situations where AIDC has the professional capacity that the military lack. This is part of the seven-year IDF C/D R&amp;D plan (FY2001~FY2007), which allocates 10 million New Taiwanese Dollars (NTD) annually for a total of 70 million NTD for both CSIST and AIDC. Initial media reports indicated that the upgraded IDF would be called the &quot;Joint Countermeasure Platform&quot;.

In 2001, it was reported that development of a new &quot;stealth&quot; variant with more powerful engines and improved fire-control system would commence that year. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;, former AIDC Chairman Sun Tao-Yu said that two new prototypes had been manufactured. The upgrade would allow the IDF to carry an additional 771 kg of fuel. In addition, it includes an improved avionics suite, retrofitted electronic warfare capabilities, and new weapons systems. The landing gear has been strengthened to accommodate the additional payload and fuel, but the plan for a dielectric radar-absorbing &quot;stealth&quot; fuselage was dropped due to concerns over weight. The project consists of three phases:

* Increase the carrying capacity for the TC-2 beyond-visual range air-to-air missile from two to four. Integrate the TC-2A anti-radiation missile and the Wan Chien cluster bomb. In addition, two conformal fuel tanks were seen on the two newly built prototype aircraft, these are not seen on production upgrades.
* Upgrade the mission computers, the electronic counter-countermeasures, the electronic warfare systems, the Active Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) system and the terrain-following radar.
* Ground and air testing.

The development contract for the upgraded 32-bit IDF C/D flight control computer was awarded in 2002 to BAE Systems. AIDC said that the improvements of the flight computer will result in &quot;a safer, higher-performing aircraft.” Other improvements made include enhanced electronic warfare capabilities, a strengthened landing gear and a digital anti-skid system. The upgrade also included new indigenous flight control software ending the reliance on US controlled source code.

The first test flight of the upgraded IDF was reportedly successfully completed a few days ahead of schedule in early October.

On March 27, 2007, President Chen Shui-Bian witnessed a test flight of F-CK-1D, and announced that the upgraded IDF will be named &quot;Hsiung Ying&quot; (Brave Hawk), which signifies that the new fighter would protect the homeland just like the Crested Goshawk.

As of 12/2009, 71 F-CK-1 A/B are upgrading to F-CK-1 C/D over 4 years span for over US$500 million, according to AIDC CEO, under Project &quot;Hsiang Chan&quot; (翔展), as AIDC and ROCAF had signed a contract for the expected upgrade program.

In 2018 AIDC delivered the last upgraded F-CK-1 C/D to the Republic of China Air Force.

===IDF Lead-in Fighter Trainer===

According to the media, the AIDC IDF trainer concept apparently involved the removal of the fire control radar and combat systems with the retention of rear-seat flight controls, so that the IDF could be used as a lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT). The ROCAF seemed to have reservations with the concept, however, as it would mean the IDF LIFT would not be usable in wartime. A MND letter said, &quot;Regarding the newspaper report of AIDC&#x27;s desire to use the IDF fighter as a basis for supersonic trainer development, it is only that company&#x27;s operational planning concept. The Ministry of National Defense and the Air Force currently do not have such a plan&quot;. The letter then said that due to a tight budget allocation the ROCAF would instead ask AIDC to extend the life of the AT-3 and continue to use the F-5 in the LIFT role.

In 2003, the former AIDC Chairman Huang Jung-Te said that AIDC still hoped the ROCAF would consider using a simplified version of the IDF for LIFT, and that such a concept could have a cost as low as US$16 million per unit, compared to the T-50&#x27;s 19 million. However, the F-CK-1 LIFT modifications or new production concepts never received government funding or approval.

In May 2006, Lt. General Cheng Shih-Yu testified that the MND indeed plans to retire the F-5E/F by 2010 and allow the in-service IDFs to take over training missions. It is unclear what modifications (if any) will be made to IDFs after they become trainers.

The trainers produced by the program would later named AIDC T-5 Brave Eagle, and four prototypes were rolled out in 2019.

<text>Old Prussians, Baltic Prussians or simply Prussians were a Baltic people that inhabited the region of Prussia, on the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea between the Vistula Lagoon to the west and the Curonian Lagoon to the east. As Balts, they spoke an Indo-European language of the Baltic branch now known as Old Prussian and worshipped pre-Christian deities. Their ethnonym was later adopted by predominantly Low German-speaking inhabitants of the region.

The duchy of the Polans under Mieszko I, which was the predecessor of the Kingdom of Poland, first attempted to conquer and baptize the Baltic tribes during the 10th century, but repeatedly encountered strong resistance. Not until the 13th century were the Old Prussians subjugated and their lands conquered by the Teutonic Order. The remaining Old Prussians were assimilated during the following two centuries. The Old Prussian language, documented only in a limited way, was effectively extinct by the 18th century.

The original territory of the Old Prussians prior to the first clashes with the Polans consisted of central and southern West and East Prussia, equivalent to parts of the modern areas of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in Poland, the Kaliningrad Oblast in Russia and the southern Klaipėda Region in Lithuania. The territory was also inhabited by Scalovians, a tribe related to the Prussians, Curonians and Eastern Balts.

==Etymology==
&quot;Prussians&quot; is an exonym for these peoples, i.e., they did not refer to themselves with this word.
The words &quot;Prussians/Prussia&quot; may originate from toponymy, as the word &quot;Prūsas&quot; (a Prussian) can be derived from the term for a body of water, an understandable convention in a coastal region dotted with thousands of lakes, streams, and swamps (Masuria). To the south, the terrain runs into the vast wetlands of the Pripet Marshes at the headwaters of the Dnieper River, which has been an effective natural barrier throughout the millennia.

Writing in AD 98, Roman historian Tacitus described the pagan &quot;Aesti&quot; who lived somewhere by the Baltic Sea coast and east of the Vistula estuary. It has been suggested that the name &quot;Aesti&quot; could be etymologically related to the modern toponym Estonia. On the other hand, the Old Prussian and modern Lithuanian names for localities, such as the Vistula Lagoon, &quot;Aīstinmari&quot; and &quot;Aistmarės&quot;, respectively, also appear to derive from &quot;Aesti&quot; and &quot;mari&quot; (&quot;lagoon&quot; or &quot;fresh-water bay&quot;), which suggests that the area around the lagoon had links with the &quot;Aesti&quot;.

The original settlers tended to name their assets after surrounding localities (streams, lakes, seas, forests, etc.). The clan or tribal entity into which their descendants later were organized continued to use the names. This source is perhaps the one used in the very name of &quot;Prusa&quot; (Prussia), for which an earlier Latin-language word &quot;Bruzi&quot; is found in the Bavarian Geographer. In Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;, the Lugii Buri are mentioned living within the eastern range of the Germans. Lugi may descend from Pokorny&#x27;s &quot;*leug-&quot; (2), &quot;black, swamp&quot; (Page 686), while &quot;Buri&quot; is perhaps the root on which the toponym &quot;Prussia&quot; is based.

The name of &quot;Pameddi&quot;, the (Pomesania) tribe, is derived from the words &quot;pa&quot; (&quot;by&quot; or &quot;near&quot;) and &quot;median&quot; (&quot;forest&quot;), which can be traced to the Proto-Indo-European adjective &#x27;middle&#x27;. Nadruvia may be a compound of the words &quot;na&quot; (&quot;by&quot; or &quot;on&quot;) and &quot;drawē&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;). The name of the Bartians, a Prussian tribe, and the name of the Bārta river in Latvia are possibly cognates.

In the second century AD, the geographer Claudius Ptolemy listed some &quot;Borusci&quot; living in European Sarmatia (in his &quot;Eighth Map of Europe&quot;), which was separated from Germania by the &quot;Vistula Flumen&quot;. His map is very confusing in that region, but the Borusci seem further east than the Prussians, which would have been under the &quot;Gythones&quot; (Goths) at the mouth of the Vistula. The &quot;Aesti&quot; recorded by Tacitus, were 450 years later recorded by Jordanes as part of the Gothic Empire.

==Organisation==
The original Old Prussian settlement area in the western Baltics, as well as that of the eastern Balts, was much larger than in historical times. The archaeological documentation and associated finds confirm uninterrupted presence from the Iron Age (fifth century BC) to the successive conquest by Slavic tribes, beginning in the Migration Period.

Permanent recorded Baltic history begins in the 10th century with the failed Christianisation by Adalbert of Prague (997 AD), the first conquest attempts at the expense of the Old Prussians by the duchy of the Polans under Mieszko I and the Duchy of Greater Poland under his son Bolesław, as a number of border areas were eventually lost.

Around the year 1000 AD, the Kashubians and Pomeranians lived to the west of the Old Prussians, the Poles to the south, the Sudovians (sometimes considered a separate people, other times regarded as a Prussian tribe) to the east and south-east, the Skalvians to the north, and the Lithuanians to the northeast.

The smallest social unit in Baltic lands was the &quot;laūks&quot;, a word attested in Old Prussian as &quot;field&quot;, which were small family oriented settlements, households and the surrounding fields, only separated from one another by uninhabited areas of forest, swamp and marsh. The word appears as a segment in Baltic settlement names, especially in Curonian, and is found in Old Prussian placenames such as in &quot;Stablack&quot;, from &quot;stabs&quot; (stone) + &quot;laūks&quot; (field, thus &quot;stone field&quot;). The plural is not attested in Old Prussian, but the Lithuanian plural of &quot;laukas&quot; (&quot;field&quot;) is &quot;laukai&quot;.

A &quot;laūks&quot; was also formed by a group of farms, that shared economic interests and a desire for safety, ruled by a male head of the family and centred on strongholds or hill forts. The supreme power resided in general gatherings of all adult males, who discussed important matters concerning the community and elected the leader and chief; the leader was responsible for the supervision of the everyday matters, while the chief (the &quot;rikīs&quot;) was in charge of the road and watchtower building, and border defense, undertaken by &quot;Vidivarii&quot;.

The head of a household was the &quot;buttataws&quot; (literally, the &quot;house father&quot;, from &quot;buttan&quot;, meaning &quot;home&quot;, and &quot;taws&quot;, meaning &quot;father&quot;). Larger political and territorial organisations, called &quot;terrula&quot; in Latin (a small land), existed in the early 13th century in the territories which later comprised Prussia, Latvia and Lithuania and centred on strongholds or hill forts. Such a political territorial unit covered up to and could have up to 2,000 inhabitants. They were known as &quot;pulka&quot;, comprising a dozen or so laukses.

Because the Baltic tribes inhabiting Prussia never formed a common political and territorial organisation, they had no reason to adopt a common ethnic or national name. Instead they used the name of the region from which they came – Galindians, Sambians, Bartians, Nadruvians, Natangians, Scalovians, Sudovians, etc. It is not known when and how the first general names came into being. This lack of unity weakened them severely, similar to the condition of Germany during the Middle Ages.

According to Jan Długosz, the Prussians, Samogitians, and Lithuanians were the same tribe.

The Prussian tribal structure is well attested in the &quot;Chronicon terrae Prussiae&quot; of contemporary author Peter of Dusburg, a chronicler of the Teutonic Order. The work is dated to 1326. He lists eleven lands and ten tribes, which were named on a geographical basis. These were:

==Culture, religion and customs==
 (in Anglo-Saxon) (English translation) describes a ninth century voyage by traveller and trader Wulfstan of Hedeby to the land of the Old Prussians. He observed their funeral customs.

===Customs===

Characterized as a humble people, who dressed plainly, the Old Prussians were &quot;distinguished for their valor and great bodily strength&quot;. They generally rejected luxury, yet were very hospitable, and enjoyed celebrating and drinking excessively, usually mead. Wulfstan of Hedeby, who visited the trading town of Truso at the Vistula Lagoon, observed that wealthy people drank fermented mare&#x27;s milk kumis instead of mead. According to Adam of Bremen, the Sambians are said to have consumed horse blood as well as horse milk. He also mentions that horse meat was eaten.

Women held no powerful positions among the Old Prussians and, according to Peter von Dusburg, were treated like servants, forbidden to share the husband&#x27;s table. Commercial marriage was widespread and after the husband&#x27;s death, the widow fell to the son, like other inheritance. Polygyny, up to three wives, was widespread. Adultery was a serious crime, punishable with death. After the submission, commercial marriage and polygyny were forbidden.

===Burial customs===
According to archaeological evidence, pre-Christian burial customs changed over the centuries.

During the Iron Age (5th century BC – 1st century AD), the western Baltic kurgan and barrow culture was widespread among the Old Prussians. It was then that cremation in urns appeared. Grave mounds were raised over stone cells for up to 30 urns, or stone boxes for the urns were buried in Bronze Age style barrows.

During the early phase of imperial Rome, shallow graves appeared in which the corpse was buried in tree coffins. Cremation with urns spread from the third century onwards. Except for the Samians and Sudauers, where shallow grave fields existed until Christianization, cremation pits without urns increasingly became the only form of burials among the Prussians. However, different forms of burial could occur side by side at the same time.

====Stone babas====

The Stone babas, found all over Old Prussia, have for centuries caused considerable speculation and dissent among scholars. Beginning with a lack of confirmation about their original location and context, all subsequent questions on their age, the chronology of the objects, an exact definition of their function, their provenance, pointing to which cultural influence have not been addressed until the late 19th century. A majority of past and present researchers agree the babas were created between the 8th and 13th centuries as a &quot;result of a long cultural process among the population of early Iron Age area of the south-eastern Baltic coast, which was affected by both the early traditions of the local craft and inspirations from countries already under Christian influence.&quot;

===Old Prussian religion===

Baltic paganism has been described as a form of &quot;polydoxy&quot;, a belief in the sacredness of all natural forces and phenomena, not personified but possessing their own spirits and magical powers. They thought the world inhabited by a limitless number of spirits and demons, believed in a soul and an afterlife, and practiced ancestor worship. Some authors, by contrast, have argued for a well developed, sophisticated Old Prussian polytheism with a clearly defined pantheon of gods.

The highest priest &quot;Kriwe-Kriwajto&quot; was to be in permanent connection with the spirits of the dead ancestors. He lived in a sacred grove, the &quot;Romove&quot;, a place off limit for anyone but elite clergy. Each district was headed by its &quot;Kriwe&quot;, who also served as lawgiver and judge. The &quot;Kriwe-Kriwajto&#x27;s&quot; next in rank, the &quot;Siggonen&quot; were expected to maintain the healthy spiritual connection with natural sacred sites, like springs and trees. The &quot;Wurskaiten&quot; – priests of lower rank – were supposed to superintend rites and ceremonies.

===Christianisation===
With the submission to the Teutonic Order in 1231, the Old Prussians were Christianised. How long the old paganism lived on cannot be inferred from the sources. Pagan customs are said to have lasted the longest with the remote Sudauers. In the 16th century, the so-called Sudovian Book (&quot;Sudauerbüchlein&quot;) was created, which described a list of gods, &quot;pagan&quot; festivals and goat sanctification. However, researchers argue that this little book misinterpreted traditional folk customs as &#x27;pagan&#x27; in the context of the Reformation.

==History==
Cassiodorus&#x27; &quot;Variae&quot;, published in 537, contains a letter written by Cassiodorus in the name of Theodoric the Great, addressed to the &quot;Aesti&quot;:

The Old Prussians are called &quot;Brus&quot; by the Bavarian Geographer in the ninth century.

More extensive mention of the Old Prussians in historical sources is in connection with Adalbert of Prague, who was sent by Bolesław I of Poland. Adalbert was slain in 997 during a missionary effort to Christianize the Prussians. As soon as the first Polish dukes had been established with Mieszko I in 966, they undertook a number of conquests and crusades not only against Prussians and the closely related Sudovians, but against the Pomeranians and Wends as well.
Beginning in 1147, the Polish duke Bolesław IV the Curly (securing the help of Ruthenian troops) tried to subdue Prussia, supposedly as punishment for the close cooperation of Prussians with Władysław II the Exile. The only source is unclear about the results of his attempts, vaguely only mentioning that the Prussians were defeated. Whatever were the results, in 1157 some Prussian troops supported the Polish army in their fight against Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.

In 1166, two Polish dukes, Bolesław IV and his younger brother Henry, came into Prussia, again over the Ossa River. The prepared Prussians led the Polish army, under the leadership of Henry, into an area of marshy morass. Whoever did not drown was felled by an arrow or by throwing clubs, and nearly all Polish troops perished. From 1191 to 1193 Casimir II the Just invaded Prussia, this time along the river Drewenz (Drwęca). He forced some of the Prussian tribes to pay tribute and then withdrew.

Several attacks by Konrad of Masovia in the early 13th century were also successfully repelled by the Prussians. In 1209 Pope Innocent III commissioned the Cistercian monk Christian of Oliva with the conversion of the pagan Prussians. In 1215, Christian was installed as the first bishop of Prussia. The Duchy of Masovia, and especially the region of Culmerland, become the object of constant Prussian counter-raids. In response, Konrad I of Masovia called on the Pope for aid several times, and founded a military order (the Order of Dobrzyń) before calling on the Teutonic Order. The results were edicts calling for Northern Crusades against the Prussians.

In 1224, Emperor Frederick II proclaimed that he himself and the Empire took the population of Prussia and the neighboring provinces under their direct protection; the inhabitants were declared to be &quot;Reichsfreie&quot;, to be subordinated directly to the Church and the Empire only, and exempted from service to and the jurisdiction of other dukes. The Teutonic Order, officially subject directly to the Popes, but also under the control of the empire, took control of much of the Baltic, establishing their own monastic state in Prussia.

In 1230, following the Golden Bull of Rimini, Grand Master Hermann von Salza and Duke Konrad I of Masovia launched the Prussian Crusade, a joint invasion of Prussia to Christianise the Baltic Old Prussians. The Order then created the independent Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights in the conquered territory and subsequently conquered Courland, Livonia, and Estonia. The Dukes of Poland accused the Order of holding lands illegally.

During an attack on Prussia in 1233, over 21,000 crusaders took part, of which the burggrave of Magdeburg brought 5,000 warriors, Duke Henry of Silesia 3,000, Duke Konrad of Masovia 4,000, Duke Casimir of Kuyavia 2,000, Duke Wladyslaw of Greater Poland 2,200 and Dukes of Pomerania 5,000 warriors. The main battle took place at the Sirgune River and the Prussians suffered a decisive defeat. The Prussians took the Christian bishop and imprisoned him for several years.

Numerous knights from throughout Catholic Europe joined in the Prussian Crusades, which lasted sixty years. Many of the native Prussians from Sudovia who survived were resettled in Samland; Sudauer Winkel was named after them. Frequent revolts, including a major rebellion in 1286, were defeated by the Teutonic Knights. In 1283, according
to the chronicler of the Teutonic Knights, Peter of Dusburg, the conquest of the Prussians ended and the war with the Lithuanians began.

In 1243, papal legate William of Modena divided Prussia into four bishoprics – Culm, Pomesania, Ermland, and Samland – under the Bishopric of Riga. Prussians were baptised at the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, while Germans and Dutch settlers colonized the lands of the native Prussians; Poles and Lithuanians also settled in southern and eastern Prussia, respectively. Significant pockets of Old Prussians were left in a matrix of Germans throughout Prussia and in what is now the Kaliningrad Oblast.

The monks and scholars of the Teutonic Order took an interest in the language spoken by the Prussians and tried to record it. In addition, missionaries needed to communicate with the Prussians in order to convert them. Records of the Old Prussian language therefore survive; along with little-known Galindian and better-known Sudovian, these records are all that remain of the West Baltic language group. As might be expected, it is a very archaic Baltic language.

Old Prussians resisted the Teutonic Knights and received help from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the 13th century in their quest to free themselves of the military order. In 1525 Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach secularized the Order&#x27;s Prussian territories into the Protestant Duchy of Prussia, a vassal of the crown of Poland. During the Reformation, Lutheranism spread throughout the territories, officially in the Duchy of Prussia and unofficially in the Polish province of Royal Prussia, while Catholicism survived in the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, the territory of secular rule comprising a third of the then Diocese of Warmia. With Protestantism came the use of the vernacular in church services instead of Latin, so Albert had the Catechisms translated into Old Prussian.

Because of the conquest of the Old Prussians by Germans, the Old Prussian language probably became extinct in the beginning of the 18th century with the devastation of the rural population by plagues and the assimilation of the nobility and the larger population with Germans or Lithuanians. However, translations of the Bible, Old Prussian poems, and some other texts survived and have enabled scholars to reconstruct the language.

<text>The MICA is a French anti-air multi-target, all weather, fire-and-forget short to medium-range missile system manufactured by MBDA France. Its name is an abbreviation of Missile d&#x27;Interception, de Combat et d&#x27;Auto-défense (). It is intended for use both by air platforms as individual missiles as well as ground units and ships, which can be equipped with the rapid fire MICA Vertical Launch System. It is fitted with a thrust vector control (TVC) system. It was developed from 1982 onward by Matra. The first trials occurred in 1991, and the missile was commissioned in 1996 to equip the Rafale and Mirage 2000. It is a replacement for both the Super 530 in the interception role and the Magic II in the dogfighting role. MICA-EM and MICA-IR both can fulfill the roles of short-range and medium range BVR air to air missiles.

On 11 June 2007, a MICA launched from a Rafale successfully demonstrated its over-the-shoulder capability by destroying a target behind the launch aircraft. The target was designated by another aircraft and coordinates were transmitted via Link 16.

==Characteristics==
There are two MICA variants; MICA RF has an active radar homing seeker and MICA IR has an imaging infra-red homing seeker. Both seekers are designed to filter out counter-measures such as chaff and decoy flares. A thrust vector control unit fitted to the rocket motor increases the missile&#x27;s agility. The missile is capable of lock-on after launch (LOAL) which means it is capable of engaging targets outside its seeker&#x27;s at-launch acquisition range. Mounted on the Rafale, the MICA IR can provide IR imagery to the central data processing system, thus acting as an extra sensor.

MICA can also be employed as a short-range surface-to-air missile. It is available in a ground-based version, VL MICA, fired from a truck-mounted box launcher, and a naval version, VL MICA-M, fired from a ship-fitted vertical launch system. On October 23, 2008, 15:30, at CELM, Biscarosse (Landes), a VL MICA missile successfully performed the last of its 14 test firings meaning it is now ready for mass production. The target drone was flying at low level, over the sea, 12 km away; despite this distance, MICA, equipped with an active radar seeker, locked on the target and shot it down.

Corvettes too small to have the big and costly Aster missile system are the most likely customers for the VL MICA-M, which offers similar capability as the Aster 15 but without its booster and PIF-PAF vectorial control.

While the VL MICA has an advertised range of 20 km, aerodynamic performance is significantly degraded at those ranges. From 0 to 7 km MICA has maneuverability of 50g, however by 12 km this is reduced to 30g as energy is lost.

==Variants==

* MICA RF or EM (électromagnétique) 
* MICA IR (infrarouge/infrared) 
* VL MICA RF/EM
* VL MICA IR
* VL MICA-M RF/EM
* VL MICA-M IR
* A3SM . Submarine-launched version. Installed in Barracuda-class nuclear-fueled attack subs of the French Navy.
* MICA NG . Second generation of MICA designed against stealthy targets. Infrared seeker will use a matrix sensor providing greater sensitivity. The radio frequency seeker will use an AESA.

<text>Terry Major-Ball (2 July 193213 March 2007) was a British columnist, banker and media personality who was the elder brother of the former British prime minister John Major. During his brother&#x27;s six-year premiership, he had a brief career as a television and radio personality and newspaper columnist. Despite the media attention, he always remained loyal and discreet.

==Early life==
Terry Major-Ball was born in 1932, and grew up in Worcester Park, Surrey. His father, Tom Major-Ball (real name Abraham Thomas Ball), was a music hall performer and circus artiste under the name Tom Major, and combined the two surnames when he started a garden ornament business. His mother, Gwen, Tom&#x27;s second wife, was a dancer. Unlike his elder sister Pat and younger brother John, Major-Ball failed his 11 plus exam and went to Stoneleigh East Secondary Modern School. During the Second World War, they were evacuated to Norfolk. After World War II, Major-Ball did National Service with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Germany.
After being demobilised, Major-Ball tried, without success, to save his ailing father&#x27;s business, &quot;Major&#x27;s Garden Ornaments&quot;, which was finally taken over by a competitor in 1962. The family&#x27;s reduced circumstances forced them to move into rented rooms in Coldharbour Lane in Brixton. To supplement the family&#x27;s income, Terry Major-Ball took many menial jobs. While working at Woolworths in Brixton in 1958, he met Shirley Wilson, whom he married in 1960. Major-Ball later became a meter installer for South Eastern Electricity Board and a banker.

==Brother&#x27;s premiership==
Terry Major-Ball first came to the spotlight in November 1990, when his brother John became Prime Minister after the Conservative leadership election. During Major&#x27;s premiership his brother became a media favourite. In 1994 he published his autobiography &quot;Major Major: Memories of an Older Brother&quot;, which was ghost-written by the journalist James Hughes-Onslow. It received good reviews and Major-Ball became a regular at book launches. It was praised as &quot;one of the great comic books of the year&quot; by John Wells and &quot;exquisitely funny&quot; by Auberon Waugh. He always remained loyal to his brother and, amongst other things, kept secret his knowledge of the affair between Major and Edwina Currie and the details of a secret half-brother. In 1995 he appeared on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot;.

In 1993, after noting that he had only been abroad once, to Germany while on National Service, and had never stayed in a hotel, &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; arranged for him to fly first-class to New York City, where he met Liza Minnelli. Terry Major-Ball later went to Christchurch, New Zealand, to open a garden gnome festival. He had columns in &quot;The Daily Express&quot;, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Major-Ball also made a BBC2 travel programme called &quot;A Postcard to my Brother&quot;, where he visited France, Germany and Poland.

==Later years==
Following John&#x27;s departure from office after the 1997 general election, Terry Major-Ball&#x27;s fame dwindled. In 2003, he moved to Somerset from Croydon, London, where he spent the remaining years of his life until his death from prostate cancer on 13 March 2007 in a hospice in Chard, Somerset. His death was announced on 20 April 2007. He was survived by his wife and children.

<doc id="552828" wikidata="Q188258" url="?curid=552828" title="Fezzan">
<text>Fezzan ( , ; ; ; ) is the southwestern region of modern Libya. It is largely desert, but broken by mountains, uplands, and dry river valleys (wadis) in the north, where oases enable ancient towns and villages to survive deep in the otherwise inhospitable Sahara Desert. The term originally applied to the land beyond the coastal strip of Africa proconsularis, including the Nafusa and extending west of modern Libya over Ouargla and Illizi. As these Berber areas came to be associated with the regions of Tripoli, Cirta or Algiers, the name was increasingly applied to the arid areas south of Tripolitania.

After the 1934 formation of Libya, the Fezzan province was designated as one of the three primary provinces of the country, alongside Tripolitania province to the north and Cyrenaica province to the northeast.

==Etymology==
In Berber languages, &quot;Fezzan&quot; (or &quot;ifezzan&quot;) means &quot;rough rocks&quot;. &quot;Fezzan&quot; could also be a derivation from the region&#x27;s Greek name &quot;Phasania&quot; or &quot;Phazania&quot;, which may mean &quot;the country of the pheasants&quot;.

== Geography ==

Fezzan is crossed in the north by the ash-Shati Valley (&quot;Wadi Al Shatii&quot;) and in the west by the Wadi Irawan. These two areas, along with portions of the Tibesti Mountains crossing the Chadian border and a sprinkling of remote oases and border posts, are the only parts of the Fezzan able to support settled populations. The large dune seas known as ergs of the Idehan Ubari and the Idehan Murzuq cover much of the remaining land of Fezzan.
== History ==

From the 5th century BCE to the 5th century CE, Fezzan was home to the Garamantes, who operated the Trans-Saharan trade routes successively between Carthage and the Roman Empire in North Africa and Sahelian states of west and central Africa.

The Roman generals Septimus Flaccus in 19 BCE and Suetonius Paulinus in 50 CE led small-scale military expeditions into the northern reaches of the Sahara, and the Roman explorer Julius Maternus traveled there in early 1st century CE. Paulinus reached Fezzan and went further south.

With the end of the Roman Empire and the following commercial crisis, Fezzan began to lose importance. The population was greatly reduced due to the desertification process of the Sahara during the early Middle Ages.

During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Fezzan became a part of the Kanem Empire, which extended as far as Zella, Libya. Wars against the Kanem–Bornu Empire in the early sixteenth century led to the founding of the Awlad Muhammad dynasty, with Murzuk becoming the capital of Fezzan. Around 1565 it was ruled by Muhammad ibn al-Muntasir.

The Ottoman rulers of North Africa asserted their control over the region in the 17th century. In the reign of Abdulhamid II (1876–1909) Fezzan was used as a place of political exile for Young Turks because it was the most remote province from Istanbul.

Beginning in 1911, Fezzan was occupied by Italy. However, Italy&#x27;s control of the region was precarious until at least 1923, with the rise of Benito Mussolini. The Italians were resisted in their early attempts at conquest by tribal Arab adherents to the militant Sanusiya Sufi religious order. The Tuareg clans of the region were only pacified by European expansion shortly before the Second World War, and some of them collaborated with the Italian Army in the North African Campaign.

Free French troops occupied Murzuk, a chief town of Fezzan, on 16 January 1943, and proceeded to administer Fezzan with a staff stationed in Sabha, forming the Military Territory of Fezzan-Ghadames. 

French administration was largely exercised through Fezzan notables of the family of Sayf Al Nasr. Disquieting to the tribes in western Fezzan was the administrative attachment of Ghat, and its surrounding area, to French-ruled Algeria. However, when the French military control ceased in 1951, all of Fezzan became part of the Kingdom of Libya.

Fezzan was a stronghold for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi through much of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, though starting in July, anti-Gaddafi forces began to gain ground, taking control of the region&#x27;s largest city of Sabha in mid-to-late September.

The LF country code (.lf) was reserved &quot;on behalf&quot; of Libya Fezzan (for an &quot;indeterminate period of time&quot;) by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

There are oil wells in Fezzan capable of producing 400,000 barrels per day, but oil companies fly in staff from northern Libya. The local tribes are not getting any money from the oil trade, and so have turned to smuggling migrants from other parts of Africa, which is feeding the European migrant crisis and is a $1 billion per year industry.

<text>Photogrammetry is the science and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic radiant imagery and other phenomena.

While the invention of the method is attributed to Aimé Laussedat, the term &quot;photogrammetry&quot; was coined by the German architect , which appeared in his 1867 article &quot;Die Photometrographie.&quot;

There are many variants of photogrammetry. One example is the extraction of three-dimensional measurements from two-dimensional data (i.e. images); for example, the distance between two points that lie on a plane parallel to the photographic image plane can be determined by measuring their distance on the image, if the scale of the image is known. Another is the extraction of accurate color ranges and values representing such quantities as albedo, specular reflection, metallicity, or ambient occlusion from photographs of materials for the purposes of physically based rendering.

Close-range photogrammetry refers to the collection of photography from a lesser distance than traditional aerial (or orbital) photogrammetry. Photogrammetric analysis may be applied to one photograph, or may use high-speed photography and remote sensing to detect, measure and record complex 2D and 3D motion fields by feeding measurements and imagery analysis into computational models in an attempt to successively estimate, with increasing accuracy, the actual, 3D relative motions.

From its beginning with the stereoplotters used to plot contour lines on topographic maps, it now has a very wide range of uses such as sonar, radar, and lidar.

== Methods ==

Photogrammetry uses methods from many disciplines, including optics and projective geometry. Digital image capturing and photogrammetric processing includes several well defined stages, which allow the generation of 2D or 3D digital models of the object as an end product. The data model on the right shows what type of information can go into and come out of photogrammetric methods.

The &quot;3D coordinates&quot; define the locations of object points in the 3D space. The &quot;image coordinates&quot; define the locations of the object points&#x27; images on the film or an electronic imaging device. The &quot;exterior orientation&quot; of a camera defines its location in space and its view direction. The &quot;inner orientation&quot; defines the geometric parameters of the imaging process. This is primarily the focal length of the lens, but can also include the description of lens distortions. Further &quot;additional observations&quot; play an important role: With &quot;scale bars&quot;, basically a known distance of two points in space, or known &quot;fix points&quot;, the connection to the basic measuring units is created.

Each of the four main variables can be an &quot;input&quot; or an &quot;output&quot; of a photogrammetric method.
Algorithms for photogrammetry typically attempt to minimize the sum of the squares of errors over the coordinates and relative displacements of the reference points. This minimization is known as bundle adjustment and is often performed using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.

=== Stereophotogrammetry ===


A special case, called stereophotogrammetry, involves estimating the three-dimensional coordinates of points on an object employing measurements made in two or more photographic images taken from different positions (see stereoscopy). Common points are identified on each image. A line of sight (or ray) can be constructed from the camera location to the point on the object. It is the intersection of these rays (triangulation) that determines the three-dimensional location of the point. More sophisticated algorithms can exploit other information about the scene that is known &quot;a priori&quot;, for example symmetries, in some cases allowing reconstructions of 3D coordinates from only one camera position. Stereophotogrammetry is emerging as a robust non-contacting measurement technique to determine dynamic characteristics and mode shapes of non-rotating and rotating structures. The collection of images for the purpose of creating photogrammetric models can be called more properly, polyoscopy, after Pierre Seguin 

== Integration==

Photogrammetric data can be complemented with range data from other techniques. Photogrammetry is more accurate in the x and y direction while range data are generally more accurate in the z direction . This range data can be supplied by techniques like LiDAR, laser scanners (using time of flight, triangulation or interferometry), white-light digitizers and any other technique that scans an area and returns x, y, z coordinates for multiple discrete points (commonly called &quot;point clouds&quot;). Photos can clearly define the edges of buildings when the point cloud footprint can not. It is beneficial to incorporate the advantages of both systems and integrate them to create a better product.

A 3D visualization can be created by georeferencing the aerial photos and LiDAR data in the same reference frame, orthorectifying the aerial photos, and then draping the orthorectified images on top of the LiDAR grid. It is also possible to create digital terrain models and thus 3D visualisations using pairs (or multiples) of aerial photographs or satellite (e.g. SPOT satellite imagery). Techniques such as adaptive least squares stereo matching are then used to produce a dense array of correspondences which are transformed through a camera model to produce a dense array of x, y, z data which can be used to produce digital terrain model and orthoimage products. Systems which use these techniques, e.g. the ITG system, were developed in the 1980s and 1990s but have since been supplanted by LiDAR and radar-based approaches, although these techniques may still be useful in deriving elevation models from old aerial photographs or satellite images.

== Applications ==
Photogrammetry is used in fields such as topographic mapping, architecture, filmmaking, engineering, manufacturing, quality control, police investigation, cultural heritage, and geology. Archaeologists use it to quickly produce plans of large or complex sites, and meteorologists use it to determine the wind speed of tornadoes when objective weather data cannot be obtained.

It is also used to combine live action with computer-generated imagery in movies post-production; &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a good example of the use of photogrammetry in film (details are given in the DVD extras). Photogrammetry was used extensively to create photorealistic environmental assets for video games including &quot;The Vanishing of Ethan Carter&quot; as well as EA DICE&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot;. The main character of the game &quot;&quot; was derived from photogrammetric motion-capture models taken of actress Melina Juergens.

Photogrammetry is also commonly employed in collision engineering, especially with automobiles. When litigation for a collision occurs and engineers need to determine the exact deformation present in the vehicle, it is common for several years to have passed and the only evidence that remains is crash scene photographs taken by the police. Photogrammetry is used to determine how much the car in question was deformed, which relates to the amount of energy required to produce that deformation. The energy can then be used to determine important information about the crash (such as the velocity at time of impact).

===Mapping===

Photomapping is the process of making a map with &quot;cartographic enhancements&quot; that have been drawn from a photomosaic that is &quot;a composite photographic image of the ground,&quot; or more precisely, as a controlled photomosaic where &quot;individual photographs are rectified for tilt and brought to a common scale (at least at certain control points).&quot;

Rectification of imagery is generally achieved by &quot;fitting the projected images of each photograph to a set of four control points whose positions have been derived from an existing map or from ground measurements. When these rectified, scaled photographs are positioned on a grid of control points, a good correspondence can be achieved between them through skillful trimming and fitting and the use of the areas around the principal point where the relief displacements (which cannot be removed) are at a minimum.&quot;

&quot;It is quite reasonable to conclude that some form of photomap will become the standard general map of the future.&quot; They go on to suggest that, &quot;photomapping would appear to be the only way to take reasonable advantage&quot; of future data sources like high altitude aircraft and satellite imagery.

===Archaeology===

Demonstrating the link between orthophotomapping and archaeology, historic airphotos photos were used to aid in developing a reconstruction of the Ventura mission that guided excavations of the structure&#x27;s walls.

Overhead photography has been widely applied for mapping surface remains and excavation exposures at archaeological sites. Suggested platforms for capturing these photographs has included: War Balloons from World War I; rubber meteorological balloons; kites; wooden platforms, metal frameworks, constructed over an excavation exposure; ladders both alone and held together with poles or planks; three legged ladders; single and multi-section poles; bipods; tripods; tetrapods, and aerial bucket trucks (&quot;cherry pickers&quot;).

Handheld, near-nadir, overhead digital photographs have been used with geographic information systems (GIS) to record excavation exposures.

Photogrammetry is increasingly being used in maritime archaeology because of the relative ease of mapping sites compared to traditional methods, allowing the creation of 3D maps which can be rendered in virtual reality.

=== 3D modeling ===
A somewhat similar application is the scanning of objects to automatically make 3D models of them. Since photogrammetry relies on images, there are physical limitations when those images are of an object that has dark, shiny or clear surfaces. In those cases, the produced model often still contains gaps, so additional cleanup with software like MeshLab, netfabb or MeshMixer is often still necessary. Alternatively, spray painting such objects with matte finish can remove any transparent or shiny qualities.

Google Earth uses photogrammetry to create 3D imagery.

There is also a project called Rekrei that uses photogrammetry to make 3D models of lost/stolen/broken artifacts that are then posted online.

=== Rock mechanics ===
High-resolution 3D point clouds derived from UAV or ground-based photogrammetry can be used to automatically or semi-automatically extract rock mass properties such as discontinuity orientations, persistence, and spacing.

== Software ==

There exist many software packages for photogrammetry; see comparison of photogrammetry software.

Apple introduced a photogrammetry API called Object Capture for macOS Monterey at the 2021 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. In order to use the API, a MacBook running macOS Monterey and a set of captured digital images are required.
